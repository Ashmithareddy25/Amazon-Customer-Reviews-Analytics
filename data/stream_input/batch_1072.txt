B003PIUC02|5.0|I was surprised how much I liked this show. I loved Andy in this program and I think this show has just about everything for everyone. Enjoyable.
B0001I561E|5.0|Aladin was a favorite of my first born son and seeing his face light up every time he watched it gave me a feeling that only a father that wants the world for his son can only feel.  After that I was hooked so I had to get it again for my whole family to enjoy.  And to revisit the time where my son, who is now a father himself. Can watch it and see his face light up as he still sings the songs and repeats the lines that he will always remember.
B000BSLU2S|5.0|The product is thick. It is best applied with the finger believe it or not. You have to put a small dot of it on every corner of the chip as well as the center. Then use your finger to spread an even layer over the chip. I used this to repair PS3s. Great product!

B004DK5CYM|1.0|My one-star review is not based on the movie. That I give 5 stars to. The 1-star rating is because Disney has not released this combo pack with a digital copy disc. The released \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" as a 3-disc combo pack and I know that they can do that with this movie too. I will still buy Tangled 4-disc Blu-Ray+Blu-Ray 3D+Dvd+Digital Copy combo pack BUT, unless Disney decides to make this a 3-disc combo pack that comes with a digital copy, I may refuse to buy this movie.    Disney, please add that digital copy disc. You were able to do this with \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" so I know that you can add that disc to this movie too.

1400052173|5.0|I read The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks just after I read The Warmth of Other Suns, a recent bestseller that follows the lives of three Black people who migrated from the paradox of discrimination and the Jim Crow rule in southern states to \\"just the discrimination\\" of the northern states.  This experience gave me an even more vivid context from which to understand how Henrietta's life unfolded.  I came away from this read with many more questions than I had initially and this is not the fault of the author, who has done rigorous work in documenting and telling this story.  Ignorance at so many levels played such a huge role in setting the stage for Henrietta's life.  Racial segregation is at the core; the lack of education because of prejudice adds to the plot as she and her family have no idea of what is happening to her, much less the cause of her death.  The medical personnel involved grasp at what they believe will help the cause of curing cancer and in their haste totally ignore the family.  Rebecca Skloot has done an outstanding job of investigating the details and helping the family - and the readers - understand and become aware of how millions of people have benefitted from the initial harvesting of Henrietta Lacks' cells. I personally will continue to be grateful for the information I now have about how my recovery from cervical cancer was made possible by the hela cells that supported the research surrounding treatment - so that no one would need to think that I needed radium vials sewn into my body as a cure.  An amazing and poignant story.
B000002KCV|5.0|Neil Young made beautiful music in his early years, then he kind of got off track...we love the things he did with Nicolette Larson, his wife, Pegi Young, EmmyLou Harris...and of course Ben Keith, Spooner Middleton and Grant Boatwright...as in the Heart of Gold DVD he did at the Ryman Theater...anyway...he's a great musician and a good person..
B00005RIKD|5.0|I had this CD before and lost it in   a move, so to have spent my money  on it again tells you I really liked it.  Put this CD on when you making Dinner  instead of the news, it will give your day  a much better ending. The crowd adds to  the good feel of the music.  Roxanne put on your red light CD!

0375842209|5.0|We're reading this in my 10th Honors English class right now, but it's one of those books I read FIRST on my own and thought: I MUST teach this to my class.  It's simply unlike any book I've read; sporting Bradburyesque imagery but delivered in a contemporary narrative.  Also very nonlinear, which of course I've got a soft spot for.  One of those books that makes me realize all my shortcomings and limitations as a writer.
B00007EDY5|5.0|this also works on cannon cameras. FYI   it does what its suppose to . and works perfectly. BRAND NEW IN BOX
B000660UN0|5.0|The CD gives you other cuts than  the ones on Me and Mr. Johnson.  What I really like about this, is   that you get to see on the DVD,  the insightful inspirations behind  the making of the music.  Doyle Bramhall is a musician we saw  open for Eric in Oakland.  He is in the mix and a great contribution.
0982743726|3.0|All Malik wanted was to warm himself by a hot fire and drown his misery in well deserved ale.  What he got was a pair of orphaned children with magical healing powers, a bounty on his head, and assassins on his heels.  He soon finds himself the reluctant leader of a growing revolution against an oppressive tyrant hungry for power.  This is the premise of The Bone Sword, a light fantasy read that requires nothing more from the reader than a desire for a bit of escapism.<br /><br />Author Walter Rhein presents a straightforward plot with few twists or turns.  This rather linear approach is both a blessing and a curse for the book.  Avoiding the tendency of many fantasy writers to overwrite and try to cram too much into a single book, Rhein instead offers a very concise plot that allows the action to drive the story.  On the other hand, this straightforwardness is at times too clear, leading to predictable outcomes where there should be surprises.<br /><br />The book is also an example of why so many writing coaches tell writers to remove adverbs from their vocabularies.  Foliage glistens \\"appreciatively\\" in Rhein's world for example.  This type of strange description often leaves the reader scratching her head wondering what he meant.<br /><br />Readers looking for intricate schemes, epic plots, and multi-faceted characters may be disappointed.  But then again, not everything needs to be earth-shattering epic in proportion.  Sometimes you just want to escape the real world for a while and cheer on the good guys, and The Bone Sword fills that desire nicely.<br /><br />Review Note:  Author provide a review copy to the reviewer
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I didn't think I would like Hachi: A Dog's Tale when I bought it, but within a few minutes I was hooked.  The dvd demonstrates how the love and devotion of Hachi touches the lives of the people he comes in contact with.  There are some life lessons that would be good for children and adults alike.  This was one of the best movies I have watched in a long time.
B003UBTX7C|1.0|I've followed the ebook evolution with great interest the last couple of years. Amazon deserves credit for trying to hold prices at $9.99 but lost the battle to the short sighted publishing industry that seems to think it costs more to have Amazon download a stream of bits than assemble and ship books only to have most of them sold at Costco for $7. This is the same mistake that the recording industry already made because they can't see beyond their last generation business model. I love my Kindle but refuse to be robbed...I'll pass until prices get in line with reality or Google enables authors to bypass the publishers just like what is happening in the music industry.
1439181780|5.0|I purchased this book as a birthday gift for my best friend who was turning 46 ... she loved it!
B000641D2Y|5.0|Great classic addition.  Just as good as the first!  Had to own it because I could   never find it to rent and my   wife loves NYC and this movie.
0307454541|4.0|This book was slow for first 40 pages, but after those pages it was definitely hard to put down.  We read this book for our book club review and all members are looking forward to next book in this series.  There are a lot of details so not a fast reader.  Would recommend to anyone wanting to get totally engrossed in their reading.
B001UV4XFQ|1.0|I'm very frustrated. I'm an Amazon Prime member and have been since it started. I've pre-ordered a ton of stuff, and it's always come the morning of it's release. Until now. I pre-ordered this, and didn't even get the shipment notification until Friday, when it was already supposed to be here. Ok, if they shipped it late, I can forgive it once, if they'd sent it for Saturday delivery to make up for it. But they didn't, they sent it USPS, and apparently slowest possible route ever. Now it's Monday night and I STILL don't have it.<br /><br />Lame Amazon - next time I'll just buy it (cheaper) from Wal-mart.<br /><br />I've seen the film in the theater, it's by far the best of the lot. This review is low entirely because of Amazon, not the movie or the story.
0316174483|5.0|I can't wait for my granddaughter to see these books. They look very easy to follow (in fact, I tried some of the drawings).  I believe it will give her a good foundation to build her drawing skills.
B003BLE88U|5.0|Get the bonus! Jimi is really an  Alien I think. Where else in this   world can you get what he gave!
B000R7HY0K|4.0|The ending of the movie was so awesome I had to buy this movie. But I must admit there were times during the movie that I asked, \\"What is this movie about?\\" Having seen the ending, most of it is supposed be enjoyed with a good stiff drink and a comfortable recliner. It's one of those movies you could watch over and over and again and just enjoy. Don't think about it, just watch the damn movie.
B00111YM5G|1.0|This is possibly the worst movie that I have ever seen.  The script was bad, the acting horrible, and the directing abysmal.  Save you money!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Nothing to say but to mention once again: LC is a rare masterpiece. Even in short 5-star row of matching albums it shines so awesome bright...   Many listeners used to associate LC album with the title song but the devil roars deep inside. The majority of songs prove why Strummer&Jones are called the mirror genius of Lennon&McCartney.   From every moment of each song you start listening LC there is BRAIN.  Smart, elegant and encyclopedic lyrics, outstanding variety of music styles, coolest riffs, hooking arrangements.   But beware:this is not an album for casual listeners, you must self-develop to the level of knowing who were Frederico Garcia Lorca and Monty Clift, what happened in Spain in 1936-1939 and many more stuff.  But this is worth doing...   and also living to listen this 'Black-Square' of world music again and again.
B000002LQR|5.0|I have been looking for this cd for quite sometime. I finally found it here and at a GREAT price!! The cd showed up in perfect condition within just a couple days of ordering. I could not be happier with my purchase, THANK YOU!!!!!!
B000QFW7UA|5.0|The Blu Ray is the same version as already released (also similar to DVD version). What's new is the board game, some nice sketches, and a very interesting copy of a behind-the-scenes magazine. You may have several versions of this movie already (as I do), but believe me, it's worth the money!!!
B0035V35P8|3.0|I had really high hopes for \\"Ninja Assassin\\". I mean just the name of the film is all kinds of awesome! Add in that James McTeigue, the director, has been associated with some truly awesome action flicks like \\"The Matrix\\", \\"No Escape\\" and \\"V for Vendetta\\", add genre star Sho Kosugi to the mix and how can you miss?<br /><br />Unfortunately, by having most of the action take place in dark, underlit locations where most of the action can't be seen, and by using the dreaded \\"shaky cam\\" style of filming during the fight scenes, so that what can be seen is bouncy and moving so much, your average viewer will get motion sickness.<br /><br />I love the basic premise, a young boy is brought up in the way of the ninja, only to turn his back on his \\"family\\" when the girl he loves is killed. Of course ninja's don't like when somebody tries to leave the family so they set out to hunt him down.<br /><br />Enter an Interpol agent who has discovered that Ninja assassins seem to be running around Europe killing people, and her only way to prove her theory is by bringing in the \\"on-the-run-ninja\\"....you should have a must see film.<br /><br />There was so much to like about the film, the acting performances were fantastic, the gore when used was awesome, the weapons (particularly the knife on a chain thing was pretty cool), I liked the mythos surrounding the 9 ninja clans...(and hope the interplay between ninja clans could form the basis for a sequel)..but the whole thing is shot in headache inducing \\"shaky cam\\" and so poorly lit, that quite a bit of what I was looking for in the film simply can't be seen!<br /><br />I recommend you at plop this flick in your Netflix account...but I'm not sure I would recommend a purchase.
0783230079|5.0|I love this movie... it's an old favorite of mine and my mother's we used to watch it over and over back when we had it on VHS.  But once everything switched over to DVD we sort of forgot about it.  I recently stumbled on it here on amazon and was so excited I instantly bought 2 copies, one for me, and one for my mom.  It's a quirky story about a boy with 4 ghosts stuck to him.  Who he thinks are his imaginary friends.  Flash forward to him being an adult and he finds out that he has to help these 4 souls resolve whatever issues they left behind in their lives.  It makes you laugh, cry and sing out loud, lol.  Love it!
B0044KU7KU|5.0|New sound, but great sound. and their best lyrical album yet. i've been an mcr fan since they first came out. brilliant cd.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Season four drifts away from it's \\"villain of the week\\" episodes and follow a story line. Very thrilling, great characters, nice effects. Don't miss it!
B004EI3ON4|5.0|The classical elements of an orchestral film score are masterfully blended with techno/arcade sounds in a way that commands emotion.  Synthesized sounds and instruments are not new to film scores but this soundtrack puts them front and center in a way that is quite unique, and Daft Punk uses sounds that delve further into the realm of electronica/techno than most other composers would dare to venture.  Imagine attending a concert for a symphony orchestra that has cellos, violas, violins, bass, brass, winds, a Sega Genesis, a DJ section...     It's for this reason that I believe listeners and movie-goers (myself included) are so excited about this soundtrack and this movie.  A Daft Punk film score is something fresh and daring, which is obviously fitting for the film's subject matter but still represents quite a risk on behalf of Disney and the film's director/producers.  The good news; it freaking rocks.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|Great phrasing on his vocals.  Love this old style mixed with a contemporary feel.  Reminds me of Sinatra and old school singers.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I missed Firefly on its initial release and found it to be really a good series, much better than a series like SGU. I was impressed to see how the stars have evolved over time and how many of them have major shows today. The acting was really good and the story line was acceptable, but lacked the creativity to make it a lasting series.
B0024F08RO|4.0|Season four was not as good as the previous ones, as the story drifts apart from its original idea. It's kind of \\"A-Team\\" mission of the week, but the characters are still growing. Still worth watching it!
B002VPE1WK|3.0|This is a really big bag that can fit everything that you need to bring with you but the straps are not fat kid friendly they don't fit around anyone.. and I'm not that big!
030745455X|5.0|As brilliant as the last one was for me. I found the plot moving and strong. I liked that Lisbeth's past is finally revealed. I also appreciated that for this installment her and Blomkvist spent the bulk of the time physically apart. I enjoyed this one as much as I did the first and am looking forward to the third book in this fantastic series.
0553801473|2.0|Clearly Martin has lost the passion for this story.  Actually found myself skimming pages to get to the next part, and I'm a patient reader ....  What a shame.  I don't think one can be the \\"American Tolkien\\" without actually finishing the tale, and with this book I'm feeling like the tale may never be finished ... this installment seems to have been sheer drudgery for Martin to write.  The earlier books let you feel like you were there ... the scenes in this one seem more like sketches with shorthand references thrown in.

B002ZG981E|5.0|How does a director follow up one of the biggest films of all time? By doing a film with more action and explosions? Or by directing a film that is even more ambitious and thought-provoking? Christopher Nolan seems to have found the answer with Inception: you do both.    After The Dark Knight's massive success, it's no wonder that Warner Bros. gave Nolan carte blanche to do whatever he wanted with his next movie. And boy, does he. A creation spawned from his own mind (a rarity that a film this big isn't a sequel or an adaptation of a comic book or children's novel these days), Nolan delves into the realm of dreams and the subconscious with Inception.    Describing what Inception is about in a mere paragraph is nearly impossible, as you'll notice the back of the Blu-ray/DVD combo package lacks the customary brief synopsis. But I'll do my best to describe the film here: Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his team (populated by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, and Ellen Paige) specialize in \\"extraction\\" - stealing secrets from a person's mind through their dreams. Cobb, a fugitive of the law, takes one last job with the hope of being able to go home to his children. But this job may be the most difficult of all - inception, or the act of planting an idea in a subject's mind. Problem is, the human mind can't be fooled into adopting outside ideas very easily. So Cobb and his team must delve into the deepest recesses of a man's subconscious, by infiltrating a dream within a dream withing a dream, to plant the idea in the most subtle way possible. But Cobb has a secret in his own subconscious that could jeopardize the entire operation. And failing the mission might land Cobb in prison for the rest of his life, either in reality or in his own mind.    Inception is one of those films that is so complex (there are literally four plot threads simultaneously occuring at the same time during the film's climax), that attempting to pick up the film halfway through and understanding it all is impossible (which means good luck to anyone who ever watches this for the first time once it is inevitably aired on television). It may frustrate those viewers who still like to check their brains at the door when they watch their action films, as plot explanation and plot details come so fast that even a quick bathroom break might leave you scrambling to make sense of the next scene. Even the film's character's get a little confounded, as Ellen Paige's Ariadne asks at one point, \\"Whose subconscious are we going into, exactly?\\" It's one of those film's that is \\"spoiler-proof\\" since knowing how the film ends means nothing if you didn't know how the film got there.     And that is truly a wonderful thing in an age where films are so predictable that we know exactly what a movie is about and how it is going to end just from watching the previews and commercials. Nolan loves the element of surprise and keenly knows that it desire to find out will fill even more theater seats, as even the pre-release trailers for Inception gave no clue as to what it was about. It also doesn't hurt that long-time collaborators like cinematographer Wally Pfister and composer Hans Zimmer bring their stellar work to Nolan's world of dream thievery. And the best films keep people talking long after the credits roll, and the film's brilliantly ambiguous end is truly up to the viewer to decide and postulate their own theories as to what really happened.    Inception is one of the best mindbending science fiction films of our time, taking its rightful place among greats like The Matrix, Dark City, and Blade Runner. It's a film that begs to be watched more than once. Now you can buy this Blu-ray/DVD combo pack of Inception to watch, rewatch, and watch yet again. But whether that spinning top falls down or not is up to you.
0446195529|5.0|I am not given to long reviews and leave that to the majority. Characters were interesting and believable. Lots of twists along the way. The kind of book that if you like this genre may keep you up well past your normal bedtime.
B001HN69AY|5.0|Tthis film is a tribute TO Heath Ledger and the many stars who stepped in after Heath Ledgers death. It turns in to THE IMAGINARIUM OF HEATH LEDGER.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This is an instant classice. He was gone for a while, but he's back on top of his game for real!
B0035GS7M4|5.0|Checklists are important and can be life-saving. Dr. Gawande cites real-life, contemporary examples to illustrate the value of the checklist. His examples are varied and cross a broad range of settings (hospital, non-profit and retail). With these examples, Dr. Gawande underscores the universal applicability of the checklist. By citing actual situations and studies, his examples are practical, not merely academic.    Dr. Gawande's writing style is concise, clear and very illustrative. He includes a variety of lessons from many types of organizations. I work in healthcare and see checklists in \\"action\\"-they're used daily and do help save lives. This book is a great resource; it will change the way you look at checklists.
B0017DJ3UW|1.0|It's easy to hate Christmas songs as they are played-to-death each season.  But, \\"All I want for Christmas is You\\" is one of the worst.  It ranks down there with \\"Santa Baby\\", and its infamy owes as much to its stale genre as it does to Ms. Carey's singing style.  I mean, she's great for the dance floor, but Christmas music should not sound bootylicious.
B002ZG98PA|5.0|An excellent movie all-round, with a very strong, passionate and kind female main, surrounded by lovable and quirky characters. The rogue character and soldier horse together make a fantastically hilarious combo as they each attempt to get the upper hand throughout the movie's entirety. Our 3 year old LOVED this movie as she sat in wonder, laughing and cheering throughout the movie. Disney did a Fantastic job with this movie!!
B000044U4B|5.0|this album sounds best overall of all other versions i have heard i also have master of puppets on dcc!  Highly reccomend!
B0042AEOG0|4.0|I gave this 4 stars because though the CD is intended for Christmas and some of the recordings are at a slower pace, she has 2 or 3 songs which are her typical, more upbeat style of music. So sometimes it appears as if the songs do not flow into one another. Overall though, it's a nice recording and I especially like her \\"Oh Santa\\" and the remake of her original hit from the first Merry Christmas album.
B003Y3BMFW|4.0|2 discs and 1 DVD for the price of a single disc is a great deal....there are also songs on this collection I personally had not heard before so I liked that a lot.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Well I have to say that I might like this movie more than my kids. HAHA I have always loved the Toy Story movies and this one rocks also I think it has to do with the fact that my son was a huge buzz fan and we had fun with that and now my daughter is at that age where she loves toy story also. I think making buzz do spanish was great.
0786955570|5.0|For anyone looking for a straight out of the box dungeon crawl emulator that will throw you straight into monster bashing goodness - this is the game for you.  It comes with 5 pre-made heroes to pick from, you then add your own flavor by selecting the daily, utility,and at-will powers for your character.  the 42 miniatures included are decent sculpts, and can be painted to really make the pieces stand out.    This set would also make a great booster or starter for anyone that wants to leverage the dungeon tiles and minis to augment their own D&D collection for other outside of the box / traditional table top adventures.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|I'm not a huge Josh Groban fan but my wife is. I can appreciate great music and listen with her. I would just never listen to him on my own. I honestly can't stand this album and my wife feels the same way. I'll admit, he has had a great career up to this point and has created some incredible music. His sound is huge and pleasing but I have to say that this album was a mistake, in my opinion. Maybe he's trying something new or using a different producer. Either way he is not gaining any fans with this album. Hopefully he realizes that and will get back on track with his next release.
030726999X|5.0|I am finding this book to be wholly entertaining,at times confusing,with the amount of characters ,plots,counterplots,subterfuge,conspiracy and,it seems,a hundred different stories involved.Hard to put down and easy to get lost in.Excellent yarn
B0012GN0Z8|4.0|In 1987, in the shadow of his: \\"Tunnel of Love\\" release this four track EP of live music came forth and a lucky few grabbed it up. \\"Chimes of Freedom\\" is a great sampler of live Bruce Springsteen from a prime period in his career.<br /><br />This disc begins with: \\"Tougher Than Rest\\" a track from the \\"Tunnel of Love\\" album that was being road tested in front of audiences worldwide (this one and the final track of the disc are from the L.A. Sports Arena.) As Bruce is known to step up in an live setting and breathe bigger life into his songs, \\"Tougher\\" sounds much bigger when it's performed live, and this is one of the best versions you are going to find of this great song. \\"Be True\\" started life as a b-side earlier in the eighties, and it shines here as one of Bruce's best romantic songs, again this outshines it's studio cousin as the better version.<br /><br />The title track of this disc is the third track of this CD. Pete Seeger's: \\"Chimes of Freedom\\" contains a lot more verses than The Byrds used in their version from 1965, and Bruce shows he knows what the song is all about. This is an epic protest song and Bruce sings it for every man and woman that were locked up in jails and prisons throughout the world. The version of this by The Alarm, is my favorite but this rendition by Bruce comes very close to that one as he is singing from the heart and he nails this. \\"Born To Run\\" is the final track found here and it's an acoustic version that carries as much weight as any electric full-on band version I had already enjoyed...This is my favorite track of this CD because it shows the man and his guitar as a musical force of might. Bruce, is a musician of depth, and this is the proof of that in spades!<br /><br />This short EP is a great sampler of the talents of Bruce Springsteen. This is a fantastic little EP.<br />Four & 1/2 Stars!
0312600844|1.0|The incestuous literary set seems to have lost its bearings.  The freedom I felt after reading this book was from my enslavement to the \\"establishment\\" book review crowd.  If the NYT Book Review likes this book, the NYT Book Review can't be trusted. Period.        The most serious failing is the depiction of the characters.  The characters vacillate between acting in a cliched (almost wooden) manner, and at other times, wholly implausibly.  (You find yourself asking on just about every page: What?!?? Do real people talk/think like that???  Know of anyone who would think this thought upon having an affair: He saw himself as \\"another overconsuming white American male who felt entitled to more and more and more: saw the romantic imperialism of his falling for someone fresh and Asian, having exhausted domestic supplies.\\"  Seriously? \\"overconsuming white American male\\" and \\"domestic supplies\\"??)  Cliched or implausible, the characters never feel real, and so we don't really care about them.       To make matters worse, Franzen introduces new characters till the bitter end, with the obligatory intrusive (and ham-fisted) cutaway to the character's history to bring the reader up to speed.  (So we get introduced to \\"Galina\\" and her \\"materialistic Russian side\\" (of course) as late as page 518 of 562!)     I'm not even going to try to summarize the laughable plot: There are endless subplots, flashbacks, sidebars -- all mostly inconsequential.  It's complicated, without ever being clever.  (Need to move the plot along? Hey, just introduce another unbelievable, cringeworthy character. Need to restore the status quo? Hey -- just kill her off in an car accident.  Throw in made-for-tv defense contractors, rednecks, a rockstar type, add gentrification, a global supply chain for parts, and you've got a story going, never mind how absurd.)     As for the dialogue, it appears that Franzen took the least important bits of every conversation -- the parts that don't matter and channelledthem onto his pages.  Of course, dialogue doesn't have to be ponderous, and spoken words that deliberately (but, on the surface, casually) avoid the elephant in the room can be extremely powerful.  They provide insight into the characters doing the avoidance.   But this doesn't apply to mind-numbing everyday conversations that are truly inconsequential -- say between chatty teenagers talking about nothing.  Do we really have to plow through this?  Shouldn't a good writer know the difference?    You find yourself scavenging desperately for a tasty morsel -- just one paragraph of feeling or insight -- in this wordy dumpster. (And it _does_ feel like an overfilled dumpster.)  But it's mostly all \\"sludgy\\" prose, undoubtedly cranked-out to fulfill the requirements of a book contract and handed over to the amazingly-successful publicity machine.  (I'll note however, that as of this writing, the number of 1-star reviews has surpassed the 5-star reviews, so you can't fool everyone, all the time.)      I started to dog-ear pages on which cringeworthy prose appeared, and I did damage to 90 percent of the book.    This book was probably written in isolation in the East Village.  It's not a book that's informed from Living A Life.  (I'm borrowing \\"his\\" style here:  Franzen, incredibly, still uses caps to spotlight irony. Who else does that any more?)    After reading this book, I'm convinced that we need to revisit the reverence for professional literary writers whose sole purported (and conceded) expertise is to be clever with words.  Shouldn't books, with the time and effort they require to engage with, provide a minimum of non-obvious insight or feeling?  And can that ever come from a class of professional writers, when all they do is write, and write self-referencing prose?  And what happened to the editor here, who was supposed to bring a reality-check to the undoubtedly self-involved writer?    In an interview, Franzen implied that he'd wanted to avoid writing merely a clever book -- that he attempted to draw from life in order to imbue the book with feeling.  How he ended up writing this book, which has no feeling and even fails at being clever, is beyond me.      Franzen's book calls to question to Gladwell's 10,000 hour rule theory, which Franzen claims to have followed (Google this if you don't know what I'm talking about).   Franzen may have spent 10,000 hours writing in the 1980s and gotten his \\"10,000 hour certificate\\" (as he says) but you can hardly tell that from this insipid work.    To answer the headlined question: After The Corrections, it appears that Franzen lost his humility, his drive to probe human feeling, his stance in opposition to the world of hackneyed prose, and his fight-the-windmills/against-the-odds attitude, and that he simply wrote without check. And he wrote, and he wrote, and he wrote.  He didn't take a step back, or take a deep breath, or see if any of it was worthwhile.  The result is disastrous.
B003YOZNBK|4.0|Hey, I don't know what the critics are looking for, but I was thoroughly entertained by this movie.  The action was great, the special effects outstanding, and Brolin's portrayal was spot on!  Malkovich was his usual outstanding self.  It was like watching an early spaghetti western, but with better special effects and totally updated.  It's one of those movies I'll pop on in a flash when I want to kick back and be entertained.  Once again, the reviewers are looking for some other ethereal BS, instead of just \\"was it entertaining?\\".  Forget \\"real\\" .... it's called \\"FUN\\"!
0547258305|4.0|There was much to like in this book. I loved the idea of the graces. I also liked that it didn't follow the romantic notion of having to marry someone, that Katsa kept her identity. Very unlike the Twilight series. I thought that idea was very unique. And even though I really enjoyed the story, there were a few things that I thought needed some work: namely, some of the dialogue wasn't fresh enough or realiistic enough to seem natural. Sometimes Katsa came off as petulant, not strong. But in all, I enjoyed the storyline very much. For a debut novel and for YA, I thought it was a refreshing change from stories with glittering vampires
1582701709|5.0|I owned all three media: the book, the CD and the DVD. I think the CD is by far the best.  I get to listen to all the Great Secret teachers in one CD while I am driving my daughter to school or running errands. The CD is beautifully arranged and recorded.  Rhonda Byrne did an awesome job in narrating and connecting all the points of the secret.  It is basically thoughts are things; like attracts likes.  I listened to the CD at least twenty times.<br /><br />My two favorite quotes from John D. Martini, \\"...When the voice and the vision become more profound, clear and loud than the opinions on the outside, you have mastered your life, p146.\\"<br /><br />My other favorite quote is from Michael Beckwidth, \\"I believe that you are great that there is something magnificent about you regardless of what has happened to you in your life. The moment you begin to \\"think properly\\" this something that is within you this power within you that is greater than the world, it will begin to emerge, it will take over your life. It will feed you. It will clothe you.  It will guide you, protect you, direct you and sustain your very existence, p183.\\" Wow!!!<br /><br />All these must be coming from one's subconscious mind.  And if one's world from within is not manifested in the world without, one needs to change one's subconscious mind.  How is one going to change one's subconsious mind?  Check out some of these great books:<br /><br />-The Master Key System by C.

0307591549|5.0|Shawn Achor considers Tal Ben Shahar as a mentor and refers to his groundbreaking book, Happier ([[ASIN:0071492399 Happier: Learn the Secrets to Daily Joy and Lasting Fulfillment]]) several times in the book. Both are from Harvard and Tal Ben Shahar teaches the famous course on positive psychology there. If you haven't read Happier, it definitely is a great starting point.<br /><br />While my first impressions of this book were that it is just the same principles packaged differently, I ended up liking this book a lot more than I expected. Happier is very conceptual, while Happiness Advantage is more practical (even if a little formulaic/ prescriptive at times).<br /><br />Shawn Achor's main contention in the book is that happiness is not an outcome of success but a precursor to success. Happiness causes success, if we focus on being happy, we will achieve more as well.<br /><br />Another important point brought forward by the book is this: Contrary to popular perception, our natural tendency is not to pursue happiness - our default response is inertia - We continue doing what we are doing even if that won't make us happy (remember the last time you wasted a whole day in front of the television even though you had plans that would have given you more happiness and meaning). This principle is well addressed in Marshall Goldsmith's Mojo ([[ASIN:1401323278 Mojo: How to Get It, How to Keep It, How to Get It Back if You Lose It]]), a book that I wholeheartedly recommend.<br /><br />Happiness is not always a function of the situation, our way of looking at the situation is extremely important. Drucker writes (see [[ASIN:0750665998 The Daily Drucker: 366 Days of Insight and Motivation for Getting the Right Things Done]]) about Stonecutters - when three of them were asked what they think they were doing one replied, \\"I am making a living\\", the second replied, \\"I am doing the best job of stonecutting in the entire country\\" and the third said, \\"I am building a cathedral\\". How you perceive what you do makes a big difference in your happiness levels - a point Shawn brings out very well.<br /><br />I found the book quite engaging, well researched, well written and extremely useful. I would recommend this to every friend, colleague or a family member.a big difference in your happiness levels - a point Shawn brings out very well.

031603438X|4.0|Great book if you are Stones fan, and particularly a Keith fan. Very insightful and you get a lot of very interesting insider comments on the Stones' music (background, song writing theory etc.). Keith is a little full of himself in parts, but hey... why shouldn't he be? A great read overall, maybe even for non-hardcore fans just interested in the history of rock. There's a lot in here and hearing about it first-hand is great.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I had forgotten just how good this is.    Nora's voice is enchanting.  The tunes are tuneful and poignant. The arrangements are sparse and tasteful, with just the right touch of jazz chords and voicings to add interest to the pop songs, ballads, and country tunes that make up this album.  Country tune (singluar), actually.  Cold Cold Heart is worth the price of admission alone - and this is from a guy who doesn't usually like his Hank Williams messed with.  The sound-recording is superb.  Not once does it catch any \\"shout\\" or raspiness in the vocals.    As though all that were not enough, I think this is the only album I know of with a torch-song for a lap-dancer. \\"I've Got to See You Again\\" (a slow tango) will forever set the standard for that genre.
B000KX0IOK|2.0|Half Nelson had riveting reviews that I considered before purchasing it, but I was disappointed that the movie lead the viewer on several paths without a clear direction.

B000PMFTDQ|5.0|This recording of Jessye Norman singing Strauss' Four Last Songs was first produced on vinyl records when I first heard it sung.  Then as now the voice of Jessye Norman captivated me.

B003UYUP58|5.0|To use a contemporary metaphor, Cancer is the Voldemort of diseases, what with it vast array of Horcruxes and Death Eaters. Mukherjee's narrative is lyrical, the language exquisite (here is a sample sentence from the book \\"..The gibbet and the graveyard - the convenience stores for the medieval anatomist-... \\".) What an image! It is also a tale of creativity, serendipity, passion,and motivation on the part of a few key individuals driven to make a difference, where breaking the rules to advance the status quo is the norm.     I lost my wife to this dreaded disease. I had been looking for such a book since her diagnosis and could'nt find one. I wish we had it then. Nevertheless, as Mukherjee traces the history, it is heartening to note that the fight to conquer this disease has made slow but steady progress. I hope, as many of you out there, as possible, can read this tour de force of science writing.     Much awareness raising is required for the more lethal forms (pancreatic cancer and metastatic melanoma, to name a couple). I hope after reading this book you are spurred into action to support the Harry Potter oncologists of the world in their fight to rid the earth of this dreadful malady.    This book is a keeper.Buy it, gift it, spread the word.    -Suresh Subramaniam
B003VDZK8K|2.0|First off, if you know you will disagree with my review and call me too \\"shallow\\", or, more politically correctly put, can't accept me having a different opinion than you, stop reading this review right now. You won't change my mind, and I wouldn't even try changing yours. Anyways.<br /><br />Yes, the death of an amazing drummer was shocking to me. I kinda knew about his drug addiction but honestly never thought it would be to the point where the Rev would die. That said, when I pondered A7X's future, I was unsure if they'd be a band anymore, but like any band should, they will carry on. Jimmy would be pissed at them for just quitting because of his death. So rest assured, hopefully we'll get more albums from Avenged.<br /><br />That said, Nightmare is a disappointment. After 5 spins of this album, I can honestly say I don't like it. I was expecting this though, since their self titled was a disappointment. A flip through the songs will show that most of the songs sound the same and Shads sounds so boring here. Seriously, first time I heard the album, I thought \\"WOW, he's going through the motions. Like he's reading the lyrics off a paper.\\"<br /><br />Nightmare is an ugly pop song. It reeks so much of \\"song written by mainstream success\\" and \\"rehash\\" it isn't even funny. The lyrics are awful and childish. I hate how Shads keeps yelling about \\"You\\", or \\"your nightmare\\", or how \\"You should have known the price of evil\\". Plus, there are are some UGLY inflections in Shads' singing, right from the end of each line in verse one: BELOW!!!!!! SHOW!!!!!!! FOREVER!!!!!! MIND!!!!!! SIDE!!!!!!!!. The midsection confirms that they have now turned into what I call \\"Ed Hardy Wearing Douche Bag Rock\\". And then of course, the insertion of the piano which is a total rehash of a previous song, \\"Tension\\". My poor ears!!!<br /><br />Welcome To The Family is a decent song. Liked the verse but the chorus was boring.<br /><br />Danger Line is an awesome song musically but we're getting a WWII message. And if I wanna be lectured about WWII, I'll dig up one of my history books.<br /><br />Buried Alive is the reason people call A7X emo garbage. While I disagree with the often repeated stereotype, this song is showing A7X are quickly becoming what their detractors have called them from the beginning. Boring music and sucky lyrics, although the solo from Syn is cool.<br /><br />Natural Born Killer is easily the best tune on the album. I love the hardcore, all out feel. It just makes me want to headbang and it's a perfect reminder of their old days. Problem with it though is that it seems really out of place, sequence wise, as it sounds like it should be placed later in the album.<br /><br />So Far Away is a decent ballad. Shads sounds emotional and painful, the music is some of A7X's best ever and the lyrics are heartbreaking. However, a big problem with this album, and especially with this track, is that they're losing their metal edge, and are now just becoming straightforward rock. Which brings me to the next song.<br /><br />God Hates Us is probably the second of the three only good songs on the album. The intro can fool you. It certainly did for me, then SUDDENLY IT EXPLODES, and just beats you while you're down. Why not a whole album like this song?<br /><br />Victim begins with church bells and a chorus, and it's clear that A7X is throwing sound at us again, like the tribal drum beat on Brompton Cocktail. I listen to a Bruce Dickinson song (Man of Sorrows) that has a chorus in the opening and I feel like it's there for a reason. The lyrics are touching, but they deserve better music. Why is half the album boring ballads? This is seriously the most bipolar album I've ever heard, and not in a good way.<br /><br />Tonight The World Dies. It's an OK song but put it on City of Evil and I would have hit the \\"skip\\" button.<br /><br />Fiction is really interesting to me. The gothic piano is intoxicating. The lyrics are very sad- it seems like The Rev knewhe was going to die, telling us he wanted us to be OK without him. This was a demo called \\"Death\\", which was given to the band 3 days before his death. I broke down crying the first time I heard it. The best thing about it is Jimmy's vocals. The worst thing about it is the fact that the best thing about it is Jimmy's vocals. If not for his vocals, in fact if M. Shadows had sung on it, it'd be the weak track it is. It kind of seems as if it doesn't have a good ground to stand on, like you know there SHOULD be more. It's a cool track that at the same time is a very weak track.<br /><br />Save Me is the final TRULY good track. An epic, it's basically the band trying to get out of the nightmare. It has a frantic feel to it, the music is just outstanding, and it's in the same vein as The Wicked End.<br /><br />I've said enough things about the songs, but I can't say anything about the actual ALBUM as a whole. I can't just listen to a single track. An album is like a classical music symphony- sure listening to a song/movement is fun, but it defeats the purpose of a body of work as a whole. I guess you can say this is a good collection of songs, but as an album, it fails miserably. Every track feels out of place with the one before it. I listen to City of Evil, and I feel like I'm on a fun heavy metal roller coaster ride. I listen to this and I feel like I'm on an elevator to the top floor of an office building.<br /><br />As for Portnoy, he's a great drummer and he does good here. Jimmy would be proud, knowing his favorite drummer is filling in for him. However, a dead drummer doesn't make this album magically better, and for that, this album simply fails.\\", which was given to the band 3 days before his death.

B003YWUTJI|3.0|I love the music of Norah Jones. I have all of her albums. This is hard to say---but   Why did she need to make this album? She is so creative----she can write her own songs---She can interpet a standand as beautifully as anyone---examp.  \\"The nearness of you\\"   So my big question ----Why did she need to sing these songs as Duets----granted talented artists ---Why did she not choose to do them ----alone????
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|APC's Thirteenth Step is an amazing album.  Mesmerizing, this album really shows what art rock, or progressive rock can accomplish.
B004BSEKH6|3.0|First a little soap box statement:     The concept that somehow POP or TECHNO or DANCE is NOT music is ridiculous! I do appreciate all the reviews that specifically delineate what about Nicki's album they personally do not like... those reviews help put this album in perspective. But to say that a type of music you don't enjoy is simply NOT music is very close minded.    Now PINK FRIDAY:     I definately expected more from Ms. Minaj. On a radio interview she stated that this album represents the real her. If this is the case then perhaps the real Nicki is not the artist I thought she was. And that's okay, she can be her and I will respect that but at least I know where we stand. While some find her schizo-cute multiple voices and personalities annoying - this is what I love about her. I can relate to wanting to break out in different personalities of myself all expressing something the 'public me' never will. So for me, this is more of what i would have liked to see.      >> She only comes hard(ish) on two tracks - \\"Did It On'em\\" and \\"Roman's Revenge\\".      >> I even like \\"Dear Old Nicki\\", and \\"Moment 4 Life\\" bc u don't have to be hard to be real and I like the melancholy honesty, even over a pop-dance beat.     The other songs though not my cup of tea.  Overall it's enjoyable, 3 STARS, but not what I was looking forward to.
B0042RJWTM|4.0|Loved this movie and I also love the remake with Tom Selleck.  Jeanne Moreau was a perfect \\"Martine.\\"  I wasn't sure that I would enjoy this movie as much as I did the later version but it is well worth your time and money if you like depictions of the Old West.
0061251305|5.0|It isn't often that I read a business management book that I can't stop talking about, but I absolutely loved Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization by David Logan, John King, and Halee Fischer-Wright.  Over a 10-year period, the trio studied 24,000 individuals in 24 organizations, researching employee behavior in terms of the groups they form (tribes) and those who assume leadership roles (tribal leaders).  In particular, the authors wanted to find some link between the tribes and their leaders that explains how great leaders emerge, develop new skills, and leave a standing legacy where they work.    The book looks at the workplace in terms of small groups, or \\"tribes,\\" often created along the lines of department (operations, IT, support staff), status (new employees, hourly employees), personal characteristic (gender, race), or any varied set of values.  Accordingly, employees can belong to more than one tribe at the same time.  Tribal leaders are challenged with harnessing the synergistic energy inherent in any group of people and using the collective power of the group to bring about change, achieve goals, and eventually, create remarkable success for the company.    Using descriptions provided by the authors, readers can categorize their tribes as being in Stage 1 (the most rudimentary, ineffective groups) through Stage 5 (high performing companies with goals above simple market success).  A tribal leader's job is to figure out which stage their tribe is in and \\"upgrade\\" the tribe using management techniques heavily influenced by the company's cultural values and vision.  The book provides useful tips for dealing with groups at each stage, as well as behaviors that indicate you've succeeded in moving tribes up from one stage to another.  Written as both a research report and how-to manual, the book is both highly readable and easy to relate to, with numerous real-life examples, interviews with CEOs, and links to further research material.    I particularly loved the realistic tone of the material -- so many management books are all roses and sunshine with a \\"Do this, and you'll be great too!\\" spin.  Tribal Leadership is sometimes brutal in its honesty, acknowledging that some employees (and some companies) simply won't advance through the five stages, no matter how great a leader you are -- sometimes you have to cut the dead weight in order to catapult the tribe to a new stage.    Readers of this book will be exposed to a wealth of insight into the groups they work with, and will receive invaluable tips on how to propel both themselves and their groups into the next level of development.  This book will be just as useful for a small start-up group as it will for a large public entity, and should be on the bookshelf of anyone who has ever admired the seemingly impossible success of companies like Apple, IDEO, Griffin Hospital, and more.  It is a longer read than many management books (250 pages in hardback, with densely-packed text), but well worth the time if you're working with an organization that seems to be stuck in a rut or has cultural and morale issues.    In short, this is one of the best management books I have read in years. I highly recommend it, whether you're a middle manager suffering under an authoritarian boss, or a CEO who wants to develop a company dedicated to more than just profit margins and stock prices.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|The blockbuster hit that promises a whole trilogy.  The next one is expected to come out in 2012.  The nice thing is that it's a bit dumbed down so non Sci Fi types can get it (more money!) but purists of ST are going to cry foul for reasons I can't list without giving spoilers.  The cast plays well off of each other, the dialogue sparkles in some places, the story is well paced and it takes the ST traditional franchise in a very different direction.

B004EI3ON4|5.0|Some things to take into consideration.<br /><br />-To all the die hard daft punk fans.<br /><br />  This album is a soundtrack for the movie Tron. If Daft Punk wanted to make a Daft Punk Album the would very much do so.<br /><br />-To all the Tron Fans.<br /><br />  If you have never heard Daft Punk this will defiantly make you want to go out and get all of their albums.<br /><br />If you are either one of these groups I would suggest getting this album.<br /><br /> My overall opinion of the album is that some of the songs are too short and i just want more of the song. The songs have a very interesting feel to them. I enjoy the album every time i listen to it (going on number 3 listen through).<br /><br />The Value of the digital download is great. I would not pass this up. For $3.99 you get a bonus track and the digital booklet.
B0037KMHRY|4.0|Tron: Legacy is a very belated sequel to the 1982 science fiction classic Tron, which starred Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner and introduced audiences to what were then state-of-the-art computer graphics in a story about a computer programmer named Flynn who gets sucked into his own software programme and is forced to take part in vicious gladiatorial games by the omnipotent Master Control Program. The sequel, which is directed by Joseph Kosinski, sees Flynn's son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) suffer the same fate as his father, albeit 20 years later, when he receives a mysterious message from his father's old video game arcade and subsequently becomes trapped in the same digital world - which in the intervening years has become bigger, more visually stunning, and much more dangerous. With the help of a beautiful warrior named Quorra, Kevin must traverse this astonishing landscape and find a way home. The film, which stars Olivia Wilde and Michael Sheen and sees both Bridges and Boxleitner reprising their original roles, is Disney's big movie for Christmas 2010, and features an original score by Daft Punk.    For those unfamiliar with their history, Daft Punk is a French electronic music duo comprising composer-musicians Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. They first emerged as part of the French house music scene in the early 1990s and became hugely influential and successful, eventually going on to enjoy chart hits such as \\"Da Funk\\", \\"Around the World\\" and \\"Harder Better Faster Stronger\\". Their gimmick is that the pair of them wear stylized crash helmets and futuristic body suits on stage, giving them a sort of detached, other-worldly public persona a little like the Blue Man Group, or what Slipknot used to do in the hard rock scene. Bangalter has previous film music experience, having scored the extremely controversial French film Irréversible as a solo composer in 2002, but this is the first time Daft Punk, as a group, has scored a film.    Following inthe footsteps of Wendy Carlos, who scored the original Tron, Daft Punk have expanded their electronic palette to include a 90-piece symphony orchestra recorded in London. The resulting sound is immense. Many readers may be under the impression that I don't like electronic scores, but I can categorically say that this is not the case. I like electronic scores when they have a reason to be electronic, not when synthesizers are simply used to double up or (even worse) imitate on an orchestra. With its overarching themes of the human world being invaded and overtaken by its digital counterpart, Tron: Legacy has a reason to be electronic, and Daft Punk's skilful merging of the two musical palettes is one of the most engaging things about this excellent score.    In terms of the stylistics of the electronic music, there's a little bit of John Carpenter, a little bit of Brad Fiedel, a little bit of Vangelis, and (obviously) a little bit of Wendy Carlos, all mashed together and filtered through Daft Punk's high energy rhythmic sensibility, but with a larger scope and a greater lyricism than any of these other pioneering electronic composers brought to their scores. There are no direct statements of any of Carlos's thematic work on the original Tron, but her fingerprints are everywhere, and I have to say that this is some of the best synth writing I have heard in a film score in years. It becomes even better when it mixes with the large-scale symphonic forces provided by the London orchestra, which humanizes and warms the electronic tones, giving them an emotional center and a great deal of power and gravitas.    Many will inevitably compare this music to that of Hans Zimmer, especially his recent score for Inception (listen to \\"Recognizer\\"), but while the orchestral tones are similar in their chord progressions and rhythmic ideas, the electronics have a sophistication way beyond anything anyone from Remote Control has shown to date. The multiplicity of tones, sample types,and nostalgic throwbacks to the synth sounds of the 1980s give the electronic parts of Tron: Legacy a depth and variety almost never heard in scores of this type. Whereas Zimmer and company often limit the scope of their electronic palette, Daft Punk opens theirs up to encompass a massive range.    The opening \\"Overture\\" introduces the main theme of the film, a heroic piece which has a vague similarity to Aaron Copland's classic piece Fanfare for the Common Man. \\"The Grid\\" features some stirring and dramatic narration by Jeff Bridges (the only cue to do so), which builds to an alien-sounding but wonderfully effective statement of the main theme. In the score's conclusive cues - \\"C.L.U\\", \\"Flynn Lives\\" and the \\"Finale\\" - the theme reaches appropriately epic proportions, while in the \\"End Titles\\" cue the theme is accompanied by a modern, driving, defiantly upbeat electronic accompaniment which is simply terrific. There is even room for a conventionally attractive classical love theme, \\"Adagio for Tron\\", which features an absolutely gorgeous cello solo, before going on to pick up a bubbling electronic undercurrent during its second half.    The action music is busy and powerful, with thunderous cues like \\"Rinzler\\", \\"The Game Has Changed\\", \\"Fall\\" and \\"Disc Wars\\" building layer upon layer of propulsive electronic sound design and booming percussion hits over a bed of churning, endlessly moving string lines. \\"Outlands\\" has a terrific Don Davis-style fading brass effect towards the end of the cue, while \\"Rectifier\\" has portentous horn blasts and an ominous, I'm-coming-to-get-you string figure which sounds more like something Elliot Goldenthal would write, and has a wonderful, palpable sense of danger. The moments of pure electronica - \\"The Son of Flynn\\", \\"Armory\\", the Terminator-like \\"Arena\\", the groovy \\"End of Line\\", the aggressive and highly-charged \\"Derezzed\\", the unexpectedly graceful \\"Solar Sailer\\" - are fascinating, and often have a mesmerizing dream-like ambience which is astonishingly effective. Some of these cues have the same hypnotic, euphoric aura that 1990s trance music had, which makes perfect sense considering Bangalter and Homem-Christo's respective backgrounds.    Knowing me and my tastes, Tron: Legacy is the last score you would expect me to praise, but there's something about Daft Punk's music here which is immensely engaging and interesting. Maybe it's the sense of freedom and lack of cynicism that composers new to film music always seem to have, being let loose in an exciting new world. Maybe it's their total commitment to the project, and their obvious thrill at being able to incorporate an orchestra into their music for the first time which makes things so appealing. Their electronic sound design is so fresh and lively when compared to the tired old samples we have grown accustomed to hearing over the last few years. And while their orchestral writing is certainly not groundbreaking in any way, it has a pleasing tonality and an appropriately grand scale which makes it very easy to enjoy. It's unlikely to win any awards, but in this case it really doesn't matter: this is one of my favorite scores of the year, and I'm as surprised to be typing that line as I'm sure you are to be reading it.

B002WY65W4|4.0|I didn't know how to take this movie when it first came out.  I waited until it was available on disk and put it in my queue with one of the online rental places.  I'm glad I got it and I wish I would have seen it on the big screen!<br /><br />Overall a good comedy, with excellent pacing and casting.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but only gave it four stars because it lacked a bit in the extras department.  I grabbed it on blu-ray and watch it on my [[ASIN:B0036WS4D4 Sony BDP-S570 3D Blu-ray Disc Player]], and I would have liked to see it in 7.1 so I could better enjoy my [[ASIN:B003LVZYNI Denon AVR-3311CI 7.2 Channel Network Home Theater Receiver with HDMI 1.4a (Black)]], but alas, it was in 5.1.  Overall I'm happy with it and am glad I added it to my collection.
015603252X|5.0|\\"A Tale of Love and Darkness\\" is quite possibly my favorite book ever-- and I usually don't care much for the memoire genre.  The language is gorgeous and deep as poetry.  But the book is also sociological,and helps you understand what it was like to grow up in Israeli society in the wake of WWII. At the heart of the story is Oz's beautiful but tormented mother, who took her own life when he was still a child.  This tragedy, and Oz's alienation from his father, drove him to join a kibbutz as a teenager.  The story circles inexorably around the suicide and zeroes in on it only at the very end.  The passage in which Oz dreams of saving his mother is one of the most resonant in all of literature, for me:<br /><br />\\"I would certainly have tried my hardest to explain to her why she musn't.  And if I did not succeed I would have done everything possible to stir her compassion, to make her take pity on her only child.  I would have cried and I would have pleaded without any shame and I would have hugged her knees, I might even have pretended to faint or I might have hit and scratched myself till the blood flowed as I had seen her do in moments of dispair...\\" (p. 516)<br /><br />I leave the rest to you.  I wish I could read the original Hebrew.  This book is a masterpiece.  So beautiful, it hurts.

Even my oldest daughter (4) loves to play with this baby doll! Very sweet features, smells good, and light enough to carry around all day. Its a bonus that Corolle makes their dolls w/o BPA, PVC or phthalate so its safe for the kids to put in their mouth. She has a soft body too. Highly recommended!
193413712X|2.0|I will concede that perhaps this book is just 'too much for me'. The author clearly has an ample vocabulary and years of studying both reading and writing on his side.     Regardless, he uses pronouns repetitively and in such a way that I wasn't sure who the author was talking about. The protagonist? The protagonist's father, son or grandson? I didn't know. I had to reread the paragraph several times to make sure, which made me take a step out of the story. I persevered, however, until I could get used to the authors use of pronouns.    Then that Tinker Talk, the bits where the author rattles on using obscure tinkering terms that I don't know and couldn't care less about. Those are what finally got me. I started just skimming them, then skipping them altogether, but in the end, I just called it quits.    Some pieces of the story were quite intriguing and had me turning pages, but trying to wade through the muddled brain of the protagonist and cope with the author's narcissistic knowledge of clock bits would kill it for me.    I will give the book another go in a year or two, but I have a feeling it'll go much the same way.

B004EI3ON4|4.0|When the word got out that Daft Punk would be scoring the sequel to TRON it generated something of a phenomenon- where fans were more excited for a soundtrack than a movie itself.<br /><br />Unlike the original TRON soundtrack, there's no silliness or cheesy comedy on display here; the ridiculous scherzo is replaced with both a poignant adagio and a nocturne to underscore the higher stakes in this upgrade to the TRON saga. Orchestrations mixed with techno beats might put off those looking for a pure Daft Punk release, but remember this is a movie score and tracks will be scene-specific and somewhat repetitive in their themes. Plotlines and emotional arcs are being explored here; the symphony lends gravitas to the proceedings and it all comes out pretty good. The only real negatives here are that most tracks are pretty short, clocking in between 1 ½ to 2 ½ minutes. The other is that this isn't a complete release- a few tracks are held back for the deluxe version and one is only available directly from iTunes. How typically Disney...<br /><br />Wendy Carlos' semi-iconic 24-note TRON theme is used both sparingly and excessively; you get heavy doses of it, but only in the tracks at the beginning, middle and end of the cd. There's also a couple of secondary themes at work here, notably a cello rush and sub-tonal pulsing rhythm that are very effective at setting the mood. The rest of the cuts are peppered with soundscapes that are strikingly similar to Hans Zimmer, Brad Fiedel, and a couple others. But after having seen the flick, I can say it does all fit very well.<br /><br />Some Highlights: *Potential Spoilers*<br /><br />Overture- Begins with a single extended synth note underscored by cello until a solo trombone breaks in at the 0:25 mark with a couple of solemn two-noters before it blossoms into a reprise of the TRON theme at 0:52. At 1:35 the synths, string and brass come together (in a pretty rough edit) for another reprise. A very nice build up, but it doesn't appear in the film.<br /><br />The Grid- Used for the movie's opening sequence, it starts with a brief plot exposition delivered by Jeff Bridges, supported by a pulsing percussion and the debut of one of the secondary themes- an 8-note pulsing reverb- accompanied by a string version of the theme before ending with a TRON reprise in synth.<br /><br />Recognizer- Named for the police program that sends Sam Flynn and other captured programs to the arena games.  Built upon the second major theme- the 8-note cello rush- accompanied by some Zimmer-style bottom and driving sub-tones, it also incorporates an alternate TRON keyboard motif to flesh things out. Very reminiscent of the themes from 'The Dark Knight'.<br /><br />Rinzler- 8-note sub-tonal intro highlighted by a couple of 4-note crashing percussion sets. Some eerie synth notes blend into a pulsed rhythm supported by cello. Synths and rhythm rise in full with a new set of dystopian percussion before falling into a fade out.  A nice intro for C.L.U.'s enigmatic enforcer.<br /><br />The Game Has Changed- Plays during this film's version of the iconic- and very well done- lightcycle battle, it's also the track used in the initial teaser footage and first trailers. Starts with the 8-note sub-tonal pulse used in 'Rinzler', it only takes ten seconds for the dystopic drums to appear. At :20 seconds they crash head on with a violin rush behind them. Switches to strings and synths until the sub-tones return at 1:13 and the string emerge again, followed by more synth. This sequence repeats a couple times with some alternate synths and filtering thrown in making for a dark, intriguing mix before ending with the crashing drums.<br /><br />End of Line- Welcome to the most exclusive club in The Grid.  Shades of Thomas Dolby with the snare and kick synth combo. Leads into high and mid layered keyboards before adding a couple layers of 7-note synths to carry it. Add in some flutter and warbling effects and it's not bad.<br /><br />Derezzed- Used for the smackdown fight scene inside the End of Line Club between the heroes and some goons- it's 100% Daft Punk! Fast, frenzied and completely schizoid- and I love the ending when it goes all off-kilter and spastic... in a good way! Only thing wrong with it is it's over way too soon at only 1:44.<br /><br />TRON Legacy End Credits- Built upon repeating layers of 5-note synths over a 4-note looped drum track. At 1:18 the TRON theme comes in on keyboard. The third time through the theme it gets fleshed out with part of the orchestra as the synths drop underneath. Makes for a nice denouement.<br /><br />Though I'm not a big fan of the franchise this soundtrack had me pumped up to see this flick and it's a flawless complement to the movie.

B004DK5CW4|3.0|If you want a nice colorful family friendly movie and you love horses and the way they run - this movie is for you. The film has exceptional photography and sound even though like the Titanic movie, you know the ending. But, what an ending. This horse was exceptional. The second story in \\"Secretariat\\" was the \\"lady horseman in a man's game \\". Yes, and the \\"third story\\", family versus dreams of destiny. I was there at Belmont when Secretariat won by 31 lengths ( oops, I gave the sinking ship story away, sorry ). I will buy this movie and watch it a few times over and over and hope for great extras ( we Secretariat lovers deserve it ) BUT, I have a SUGGESTION. Watch the movie - and hopefully it will increase your thirst for more about the backstory and true facts about this amazing equine athlete- then run out and buy the 1975, William Nack book, \\"SECRETARIAT\\" ( also titled \\"Big Red of Meadow Stable\\" and/or \\"Secretariat:The Making of a Champion\\" )You will come away with much more. His \\"real story\\" true to the word and without the Disney-touch. You'll learn how he got his name ( and the almost other names ) and more about his dad, Bold Ruler and a not too shabby stablemate named Riva Ridge and the real factual \\" coin toss\\" that brought this champion to Penny & Meadow farm.

B003AOAXGE|3.0|Amazon has a separate listing for the DVD with extras (as of today, it's only $2 more).  I'm ordering that now -- it was my mistake for ordering the first one I saw and not reading carefully.      Beware, too, that this re-worked story line is darker than the original.  I suggest you watch it before sharing it with young kids.  I agree with the comments a few other have made about the initial encounter with the hunter -- it seemed unnecessary, as does Grandfather locking Peter in the yard.      The music's excellent, if not exactly what Prokofiev wrote, and performed beautifully.

B001VNB54A|4.0|Having read The Pacific by Ambrose and watched the miniseries on HBO, I was very interested in acquiring the series in Blu-ray as soon as it became available.    I am going to assume you know the basic story of Leckie, Basilone and Sledge and the Marines in winning the war in the Pacific. The series and book certainly opened my eyes as to the horror of the Pacific war. I honestly had no idea.    The series is not Band of Brothers, nor should it be. It stands alone and I congratulate Mr. Speilberg and Mr. Hanks on another superb job in presenting what the greatest generation did for us.    My only complaint is that the on-screen menus are cumbersome to use, particularly if you want subtitles in English. Maybe it is just my Blu-ray player, but getting to the point where you can actually select the episode to watch and get to it is confusing and time-consuming.    The quality of the production is superb, the sound is great and the music is magnificent. And, they released the Blu-ray package much sooner than they released Band of Brothers, which was a real plus. I waited a long time for BoB to be release on DVD.    If you enjoyed Band of Brother or Saving Private Ryan, you will not be disappointed by The Pacific. Worth every penny.
0060558121|5.0|In American Gods, traditions linger and refuse to fade, gods are spawned by the handed-down thoughts of immigrants, and belief and reality are one and the same thing. This is a novel about the soul of America, and the heart of the modern world, with maybe just a tad of how our past shaped us, all told through a cast of characters that's as offbeat and well developed as it is numerous.<br /><br />Gaiman's themes here are weighty, and they could drag off and drown your average narrative with their importance. Gaiman doesn't even try to fight this; he lets the book be tossed to and fro, gyrating wildly and leaping off into tangents in order to explore part after part of his post-mythology mythos. As such, though the story is interesting on its own, and the character's usually well drawn, this is more a novel about America and its synthesis than it is about anything else.<br /><br />The gods were brought here by the immigrants (the Irish leprechaun upon ships during the days of famine; the pixies and their ilk from English prisoners; Odin from exploratory and bloodthirsty Viking longboats; the Egyptian pantheon of Anubis, Thoth, Horus, Bast settling in New Egypt; Anansi from - well, you get the idea) but things have changed, and, in the process of acclimatization, the believers became American, and the gods were cut loose. Now, as time moves on, their belief and traditions are fading fast towards zero, and the old deities are desperate to not simply drop out of existence.<br /><br />Now, in this new world, the actual facets of the gods' being are no longer important, the funeral director gods of death are as on the verge as a New York City djinn, and all that still matters is where they came from and whether they still exist at all:<br /><br />\\"'I have a brother. They say, you put us together, we are like one person, you know? When we are young, his hair, it is very blonde, very light, his eyes are blue, and people say, he is the good one. And my hair is very dark, darker than yours even, and people say I am the rogue, you know? I am the bad one. And now time passes, and my hair is gray. His hair, too, I think is gray. And you look at us, you would not know what was light and who was dark.'\\" (p. 79)<br /><br />Simplification is not the only change brought on by the passage of years. The majority of Gods in the book fall into one of two pathways. The first try - in vain? - to recreate the glory days, always striving to remember. The world, however, has moved on, and their attempts frequently become depressingly comical, as they try to assert their dominance over a world that has forgotten them, such as Eoster, trying to claim that she's still beloved due to the name of the holiday. In many cases, being the American incarnation of these gods, they don't even have a period of power to look back upon, such as Czernobog who cannot even contemplate his days as a dark god anymore and is able to do nothing else but dream about his years in a slaughterhouse.<br /><br />The other potential path is a darker one still, and it is one that we are introduced to at the end of the very first chapter: the perversion of everything that the god once held holy. The Queen of Sheba has become a prostitute. Even that, however, is not far enough. In a twisted incarnation of her need for belief, she forcers her forces her lovers to worship her and sexually devours them for sustenance. Her words hold true for her and for the array of similarly striving gods we glimpse in the narrative: \\"There is nothing holy in [my] profession. Not anymore.\\" (p. 373)<br /><br />But is the decline of the gods really such a bad thing? In one part of the story, we see a funeral home run by the Egyptian gods of death. They provide a more personal touch, a send off by something with more of a soul than the mechanical filling of orders provided by a big funeral company. In another subplot, we get to see a community still run and safeguarded by a supernatural being. The community's exterior is enticing and gleaming, which hides the sacrifice needed to maintain it.<br /><br />Is such a thing worth it for a more ordered world? Has our modern world of machines and computers destroyed wonder and human contact? It's impossible to truly a question like that, and Gaiman doesn't. American Gods is not a narrative of answers, but rather a tapestry of questions. You will never get a definitive answer of how the gods interact with mortals; you will never know whether the old gods were right to fight for their survival; you will never know whether the gods will one day be gone completely. But you don't need to know. In American Gods, Gaiman asks the questions, and I think that every reader will have their own answers.<br /><br />The sprawling nature of the themes, and the narration's tendency to leap after them wherever they may go, leads to an incredibly meandering text. Our main character Shadow, who is roped into the conflict as the assistant to Mr. Wednesday only hours after leaving prison. While it seems, at first, that the two are working towards a definite goal, Shadow is soon sent off to location after location without any discernible rhyme or reason.<br /><br />Further complicating matters - if you're a fan of anything even approaching linier plots - are the interludes, taken from the modern incarnation of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. These stories feature brand new characters, often separated from the main narrative by spans of decades, living their lives and either interacting with or contributing to the nature of the various scattered American deities.<br /><br />Somehow, Gaiman pulls all of this off. The trick is, I think, his intuitive grasp of character. He only need mention a name and spout a few lines of dialogue and, poof, a fully grown man appears on the stage. Each interlude feels complete enough to form its own text, and each adds to the main narrative in immeasurable ways.<br /><br />And yet, this grasp of character is not applied to one character. Shadow, whose eyes we spend the vast majority of the book looking out of, is told:<br /><br />'You're not dead'\\" she said. 'But I'm not sure that you're alive, either. Not really.'<br />[...]<br />'I love you,' she said dispassionately. 'You're my puppy. But [...] You're like this big, solid, man-shaped hole in the world.' She frowned. 'Even when we were together. I love being with you. You adored me, and you would do anything for me. But sometimes I'd go into a room and I wouldn't think there was anybody in there. And I'd turn the lights on, or I'd turn the lights off, and I'd realize that you were in there, sitting on your own, not reading, not watching TV, not doing anything.'\\" (p. 370-371)<br /><br />After his release from prison, and the death of his wife, Shadow retreats into himself, and it is rare for the reader to get a glimpse inside. This leads to a good portion of the book feeling aimless, as we're cast about in Shadow's wake, without him even knowing - or caring - where he's going. The reader that is willing to follow will eventually come to realize that Shadow's recalcitrance is not shallowness, but, in order to get to that point, you need to be willing to follow Gaiman on all of his digressions.<br /><br />On the subject of the book's prose, Gaiman says in the included interview: \\"I wanted to write American Gods in what I thought of as an American style - clean, simple, uncluttered - and push the narrator further into the background than I had in previous books. But the narrator crept out in the \\"coming to America\\" chapters, where I got to play with a wider set of voices.\\" (p. 596)<br /><br />It's true that the writing is more subdued than it is in Neverwhere or Anansi Boys, the plot less self aware. But this is still a Gaiman novel, and it's still filled with the delicious idiosyncrasies of language that characterize all of the man's writing. There are sections here that are jaw dropping in their grandeur, and there are sections that are laugh out loud funny, and both build with the other to create a wry and majestic experience, filled with larger than life characters who are anything but above sarcasm.<br /><br />American Gods looks like a simple read on the surface. Underneath, you soon come to realize the depth that is packed into every scene and every single glance. This is a book that is impossible to really predict, so come to it and get ready to be swept along. While occasionally directionless, American Gods is simply something that needs to be experienced. This is not the most entertaining book that I've read of Gaiman, but it is undoubtedly the best.is told:    'You're not dead'\\" she said. 'But I'm not sure that you're alive, either. Not really.'

0307272702|5.0|I have been waiting for a book written from this angle for years. The \\"standard\\" theory of weight management is so simplistic it isn't of much help. Sure, people gain weight because they eat more than they burn, duh. Why does this imbalance exist? Why does it happen to some people and not others? Why is obesity on the rise? Why is it so hard to fix?<br /><br />Saying that people are more slothful and gluttonous nowadays, while common, does not seem to be a reasonable answer, not when the weight gain is happening so fast, is so widespread, and occurring even to infants.<br /><br />Gary Taubes has been pursuing the answers to these questions for a while. First, he presents evidence that the calories-in/calories-out model is fundamentally flawed. In animals, including humans, it appears that bodies set an internal standard for how much fat should be maintained and where it goes. Attempts to influence this value through changing caloric intake or activity might be temporarily successful, but they won't last. Gary presents ample evidence from history, scientific research, and population studies to prove his point.<br /><br />So what's the cause of obesity, then?  In some people it may just be genetic. Overall, though it looks like carbohydrates and sugar are the culprits. The author explains the effect that carbohydrate intake has on blood insulin levels, and the effect insulin has on fat stores. None of this biochemistry is debated at all, but there seems to be a glaring disconnect between the science of hormone signaling and theories of diet and weight loss.<br /><br />To further prove his point, Gary next analyzes various diets and how successful they have been. In the end, it seems that a low carbohydrate diet is the best choice for weight loss, diabetes/insulin resistance, and overall health, *but* he warns, it hasn't been exhaustively tested long term yet. Initial tests are very promising though, showing improved blood lipids, and the most significant weight loss.  A quick sample diet is provided in the appendix.<br /><br />This is not a diet or weight loss book. This is an inquiry into why people get fat, starting without preconceived notions. As such, I think it's extremely valuable. This is a crucial subject, and the current set of theories and advice do not seem to be helping people much.<br /><br />Which is not to say that I agreed 100% with the author. He has his theory and he pursues it fully, with the best evidence he can find.  That's fine, but I noticed a few gaps. For one, just because the body has an idea how big its ideal fat stores should be, doesn't mean that people can't essentially force-feed themselves by eating beyond what hunger would dictate. Restaurant portions and addictive snacks are likely culprits in obesity too. See [[ASIN:B0048ELDCS The End of Overeating: Taking Control of the Insatiable American Appetite]] for information on that.<br /><br />Exercise, too, is dismissed as useless for weight loss. I agree that it's not effective for mere calorie burning. Appetite will counteract any deficit achieved. But exercise, especially long or high-intensity aerobic exercise uses up carbohydrates. And thus, by his theory regular aerobic exercise should have a similar effect to eating a low-carbohydrate diet. (I have read studies where this appears to be the case.)<br /><br />Still, I think this is a fabulous book despite the occasional blind spot.

Sparks' abilities to get you attached to the characters is such a rare gift these days and one he uses well. This is a love story and tragic, if you found the movie interesting this will take you further. I am to this day smitten by Sparks' character Landon and what a development he goes through.  Not gonna pep talk any longer, go ahead and buy and read this book!
B000K15VSA|4.0|One of my favorite films, and now one of my favorite box sets that I own. The only difference between the DVD and the Bluray edition is the huge price difference and the actual packaging of the discs. Everything you get is the same in each edition except for the following differences that you should be aware of:    1.Bluray Edition:  Discs are held inside plastic keep case, nothing special.    DVD Edition:  Discs are kept in a cool digi pack which is kept inside a cardboard slip case and has embossed lines and textures similar to the attache case. Inside the digi pack is very well executed with colorful photo montage and well thought out layout.     2.Bluray Edition: More expensive.    DVD Edition:  Quite cheap now to buy, bought mine for £24.99 still sealed.

B00005NNMJ|5.0|Many metal fans feel that Accept hit their creative apex with `Balls to the Wall' and while I find the album to be an outstanding example of the heaviest side of commercial metal I feel it must take a backseat to `Restless & Wild' due to the latter record's decidedly less commercial sound. Not that these albums are light years different; both were self-produced but `Balls' has a crisper production (you can tell the band had some more ducats to spend on this one courtesy of their last).  The LP was without a doubt the band's biggest American success when it was released in early 1984, a month or so after the late '83 European debut and the title track instantly made the band a known commodity in the States. I first heard it a Van Halen concert during the break between opener and headliner and man was that song loud on the arena's PA! I thought who the heck are these guys? Many fans probably thought a harsher sounding Judas Priest due no doubt to Udo's voice and look and the band did bring the inevitable comparisons but I think Accept's music of this period was better than Priest's in terms of what each contributed to its own legacy (Priest had begun to sink into a creative slumber). \\"Head Over Heels\\", \\"Love Child\\", \\"Fight It Back\\" and \\"Guardian of the Night\\" are some of my other favorites only \\"Winterdreams\\" being a song that I don't play much. Accept were on a creative roll here and if only the sales would have been complementary. Alas Accept deserves more than just a footnote in metal history but for those of you who have their catalog from the years 1981-1985, then you already know how great this band was...but they should've been much bigger...
B0034G4OVS|3.0|In 2003, a little independent movie entitled OPEN WATER opened in theatres. That movie cost less than a million dollars and ended up raking up more than thirty-million dollars in the U.S. alone.  Though the idea of a small group of people being stranded in a harsh environment has been along for decades, OPEN WATER pushed the idea to the extremes.  What would you do if you were unexpectedly stranded in the middle of the ocean with only your scuba gear? The movie attempts to examine what people would actually be capable of and the challenges and horrors they might face.<br /><br />OPEN WATER is mentioned because FROZEN is basically an artic or winter version of OPEN WATER.  The plot of the movie revolves around a group of three people:  Joe Lynch (Shawn Ashmore), Dan Walker (Kevin Zegers), and Parker O'Neil (Emma Bell).  Walker and Lynch have been best friends most their lives and Parker is Walker's latest girlfriend.  Walker and Lynch have been planning this snowboarding trip for nearly a year and Lynch is a bit upset that Walker decided to bring her along.  Lynch doesn't like Parker and though it's never implicitly stated Walker seems like he's probably going to break-up with Parker after the weekend.  The trio uses Parker's feminine charms to get all three of them onto the ski-lift for a bribe.  That's the first strike against them because there's no official record of them being there.  Late at night, the group goes for one last ride on the lift.  However, there's a severe blizzard heading in and the ski lift operator trades places with someone else. A bit of miscommunication ensues and Walker, Llynch, and Parker suddenly find themselves alone, stuck on the lift, in the middle of an oncoming blizzard.  They soon realize that the lift won't be open for at least five more days and they have been abandoned.  What follows is an examination of human survival.<br /><br />FROZEN is labeled and marketed as a horror movie, but it's really more of a suspense film.  There are some moments of gore, but not as much as there could be.  The filmmakers were wise in that regard and don't show any of the most horrifying moments (though there is one that can distinctively be heard).<br /><br />The acting in the movie is very well done which is a very good thing because the movie spends almost all of its time with the three main characters.  Had the acting been bad, FROZEN would have been a terrible movie.  As it stands, it's not too bad.  The idea it presents is an interesting one and the movie attempts to portray in a realistic manner the inherent problems and dangers of each of the solutions to the characters' dilemma.  FROZEN isn't for everyone.  There's a lot of talk that outside of the situation would seem banal, there isn't much action, and for horror fans there isn't much gore.  Still, the movie does have some strong acting and good character development.  I wasn't expecting much out of the movie before I saw and afterwards I found that I had enjoyed it.<br /><br />The DVD includes a four-part making-of featurette, the trailer for the movie, commentary with the director and three stars, and deleted scenes.f gore, but not as much as there could be.

B004EI3ON4|5.0|I vividly remember when I first saw the original movie TRON back in 1982 [[ASIN:B00005OCMR Tron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)]].  I was in college and I saw it on a whim in an afternoon matinee.  I was completely amazed and hooked.  I went back and saw it again that evening, and again the following day, maybe even twice (this was back in the days before everyone had video players).  I have since watched the original 1982 TRON many, many times.  Then when the trailers and promos for TRON:LEGACY hit the screens, I started salivating.<br /><br />Today I saw the TRON:LEGACY soundtrack MP3 version on sale for $3.99, so I pounced on it.  I've been listening to it on and off all day and I have to say that two things have struck me.  First of all, it is heavy electronica, but not overbearing.  That is appropriate given the nature of the film it supports.  Secondly, it is engaging but not overpowering music, though in a few tracks here and there the music really drives!<br /><br />You need to know up front that many of the tracks are quite similar to each other, but that also makes sense since this music provides the background for a world inside the web, where electronics are everything.  And, the music provides a consistency of place and environment that I look forward to experiencing in the movie.<br /><br />I have been a fan of electronica-focused music since I started listening to the Alan Parsons Project (APP) in the late 1970s (I am still a fan and APP music appears regularly on my playlists).  If you like APP and the original movie TRON, I think I can say with a pretty high degree of confidence that you will like this soundtrack.  Now, with that said, you are not likely to hear any of these instrumental tracks anyplace other than during the movie or on this album.  There are no chart-climbers here.  Even so, I am extremely glad that I purchased this album.  It is enjoyable, listenable, and makes me look forward to the theatrical release of TRON:LEGACY even more.<br /><br />5 stars for fans of electronica (e.g, APP) and TRON<br />4 stars for most everyone else<br /><br />BTW - my teenaged sons and I plan to watch [[ASIN:B00005OCMR Tron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)]] immediately before we head to the theater to see TRON:LEGACY later this month.

B0038W0OIK|5.0|Short Summary - This is the BEST Gaming/Music headset that you can get at this price! You cant get wrong with it.<br /><br />Detailed Review -<br />First of all let me tell you a little about myself. I am a gamer and I also used to compete back in the school days in FPS games (counter strike). So I very well understand what is the importance of sounds in game. I used to be one of the top 200 CS players in US.<br />I am also a person now days who listens to music literally all day. So I also have good sense of music and I can very easily differentiate between good and a bad headset.<br />I also have used many headsets in the past and so I think I can provide a very good opinion.<br /><br />So here we go -<br />Why are these headsets good -<br />1) Sound -<br />  Music - Amazing sound quality for both gaming and music. Bass is strong, you will literally lose your self while listening to your favorite music on these headsets. All instruments are clear and music becomes a joy to listen to and you will enjoy every moment of it. Like I said, in this price range, they are best.<br /><br />  Gaming - You will be able to clearly hear the foot steps from different directions and will be able to make proper decisions. Also this will give you a very clear and diff sounds for guns and you will be able to know what kind of shot was fired where. This headset is like a hack for people who have never used sound in their gameplay. Your game will be elevated at a new higher level if you haven't used a decent headset in past.<br />  Not just FPS games but all games in general. Try playing some horror or thriller game with these headsets like Dead space, FEAR, Bioshock  etc. I have played and I can tell you that you will actually feel as if you are \\"there\\" in game alone and someone is going to jump on you. Bioshock is actually a good example specially the initial sequence (if you have played), you will hear people crying, shouting and screaming in different directions. It really creates a very gloomy and freaky atmosphere (dont forget to turn off the lights though ;p).<br /><br />2) Build Quality - I have to say that quality is very solid and top notch. I have used Steelseries 5H V2 in the past and loved them. These are definite upgrade from previous version. Built is solid and they look well made and of good material. They feel way way better than G35 logitech headsets (used in past also). ** read my update for durability at bottom.**<br /><br />3) Mic - Mic sounds great. Sound is very clear and no issues at all. One thing I love about mic is that it is retractable and this is one hell of a unique feature that most of people tend to ignore. One doesnt need a mic hanging out all times, specially when you are listening to music or traveling. In fact it becomes a trouble when you want to pack or also looks kinda bad when you are using it to listen music from your music player. With this headset, mic is almost invisible and only comes out when you pull it out. I really love this feature. And due to the same reason mic is also protected from any kind of accidental damage.<br /><br />4) Design - This is another feature why this headset wins. You can break this headset into 4 different pieces and can pack it in any bag without hesitation. Nothing happens to the headset, just assemble all parts and use it again. This helps me a lot while traveling. After listening to music in plane, I just put them in bags and sit comfortably and not worry about damaging my headsets.<br /><br />5) Comfort - these are probably one of the most comfortable headsets I have ever used. the only thing that beats the comfort is Bose and they are twice the price. they come with 2 different kind of ear cups, leather and cloth. Use cloth in a place where there isnt a lot of noise like your home. Use leather when you want some kind of noise cancellation like a plane, LAN party, crowed place like public transport. I have to say that they are much more comfortable than G35 (G35 imo are very tight on your ears and you sweat a lot. I also feel that as if I am sitting in a closed room while using G35s. I dont like that feeling).<br /><br />6) Connections - this is one another strong point. If you buy G35, you will only be able to use them for gaming. you cant use them to listen to music on your mp3 player but these headsets can be used with anything. It also comes with extra cord which is always handy when you want to sit at a distance while playing.<br /><br />Finally - As mentioned above, no other headset can come close to these headsets in this price range. This is a quality product which you will love whenever you will use it.<br /><br />*****<br />Update after using it for more than a year -<br />I have taken these headphones for multiple international trips, I don't handle them with care, I just throw them in my laptop bag and they are perfect. I am not sure what the other user is talking about poor build quality. I use these headphones everyday for gaming and taking and they are not only holding it very well but there has not been even a single issue. I will highly recommend these to anyone.closed room while using G35s. I dont like that feeling).   6) Connections - this is one another strong point.

I find this album so different from every album he has ever done, but it's still Keith's style. It's definately one of my favorite albums of his! All the songs are lovely written and beautifully sung. If you enjoy Keith's other albums, you will love this one also :)
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|It's probably fitting that my review of \\"Dark City\\" follows my review of \\"Metropolis\\". The former owes a lot -- at least visually -- to the latter. You'd have to be blind not to see it, and the supplemental material even includes a too-brief discussion of the films' similarities. There's an excerpt of a 1927 review of \\"Metropolis\\" from H G Wells, which pretty much nails everything wrong about /that/ \\"silly film\\".<br /><br />But this is about \\"Dark City\\". The film's mysteries gradually unwind in a way that's perfectly clear to the characters and the viewer, with The Basic Reveal coming about 40 minutes before the end (in the extended version), so there's no need to describe the plot. However, I think most viewers will recognizethe analogy with the dream state in which we are assaulted by unknown forces, yet are able to perform seeming miracles (teleportation, walking through walls, etc) that protect us.<br /><br />The DVD of \\"Dark City\\" was one of the first DVDs I bought a dozen years ago. It's a beautiful film that did not come across very well on a letterboxed 32\\" screen. It really needs an HD transfer and a 50\\" or larger display to reveal just how magnificent it is. (I might also add that it's hard to believe Alex Proyas also directed the miserably sloppy/boring \\"I, Robot\\".)<br /><br />This is a gorgeous demo disk with uncompressed 7.1 sound. If the strange and the wonderful appeal to you, it's strongly recommended, at a price that makes it very nearly an impulse purchase.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time! I love horror movies, not big on blood and all that good stuff. I find that this is an actual scary movie that kept me on my toes and made me want more! This is a movie that I can't wait to watch again, waiting for 2 to come out on dvd so I can watch again and again!
B003PGNBO8|5.0|It's too bad that this was killed off early. There was plenty of material available to run 4 good 20 episode seasons and then end it before it got weak (like Prison Break).<br /><br />I enjoyed it very much. I am a horrible nit picker and there were not many instances where I caught blatant factual mistakes in the story line, etc. And considering the subject being dealt with that is impressive. It was almost completely \\"realistic\\".<br /><br />That being said, and this is a theme you will see a lot in my reviews, the \\"gun play\\" was pretty bad. They had a nice selection of guns, and the guns characters had matched them fairly accurately (the FBI agents carried Sig Sauer's like they do in real life). The problem was you standard Hollywood \\"that's not how it works\\" issues though. To most it would go unnoticed but even my wife who has only been shooting a few times picked up on some glaring mistakes. Why can't Hollywood (I'm including the networks here) hire a Firearms Manager for it's productions? You can get an expert for very little money. I'm sure they pay a ton for wardrobe and makeup. Rant over.<br /><br />All in all, good stuff. I'm bummed out it is so short. This is one series that should have continued on. There certainly is a lot of crap shows out there that keep getting renewed season after season that are not half of what this show was.

0553381695|5.0|The shipping was fast and the condition of the book is perfect.  The only complaint I have, being a perfectionist, is that there is a small logo on the front of the cover that says \\"A new original series coming to HBO!\\" which bummed me out, because I like the covers without things like that. In addition, it's not removable either.

Daft Punk have created a sonic masterpiece worthy of the legacy of Tron.  Their brilliant layering of ambient electronica with orchestral symphonics is every bit as avant garde in creating atmospheric digital soundscapes as Wendy Carlos' score was for the original Tron.  I only wish that they had incorporated some more of Wendy's memorable themes.  You can kind of hear a few familiar notes that recalls Tron's theme in \\"Adagio For Tron\\" but that's pretty much the only hat tip to Wendy's vintage score.  Like the film itself, Daft Punk have taken the music of Tron to a whole new aesthetic level by incorporating their unique style of techno synthpop along with their influences of electronic film composers like Vangelis on \\"Arrival\\" to the ominous Carpenter-esque  \\"C.L.U.\\" and synthesizing them with traditional orchestral composers like Bernard Hermann and Max Steiner.<br /><br />Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homen-Christo demonstrate they have the musical talents to command the accompaniment of a full symphony orchestra and can score unforgettable music for blockbuster films.

B000002KHF|4.0|Morrison possesses a mellow, whiskey-soaked voice that can be very engaging, and his everyman lyrics are evocative of a world we can all relate to.  His backing band is very tight, and when he gives them free rein, something really magical can happen.  If anything, he lets himself down with the material, which is not as uniformly excellent as it might have been.  For instance the opening \\"And It Stoned Me\\" reminds me of The Band, but not in a good way.  The familiar title track has a terrific jazzy groove and some fine playing from both flute and sax.  Little wonder this song was such a bit hit.  But \\"Crazy Love\\" is Morrison trying for delicate and romantic, and this track invariably leaves me cold.  \\"Caravan\\" is another superb, delightful, irresistible masterpiece, but \\"Into the Mystic\\" is less successful, and \\"Come Running\\" is only a little better.  \\"These Dreams of You\\" actually rocks out a bit - I would have liked to hear more in this vein.  \\"Brand New Day\\" is an uplifting number that partakes of gospel, and \\"Everyone\\" is bright and airy with something like a Celtic rhythm.  The closer, \\"Glad Tidings\\" is another triumph - the insistent bass pulsing throughout in conjunction with the horns.  But no matter how good the good songs are, I still count 4 tracks that I really don't care for, so while I'm recommending this purchase, I don't see it as an unqualified success.
1440503257|5.0|I originally bought this cookbook for a friend as a holiday present.  However, when I got it home I couldn't help but to open it and sneak a peak.  When I did I was amazed at the recipes and how delicious they all sounded.  I knew then I needed my own copy.  When my copy arrived the first recipe I decided to try was the \\"Pull-apart Cinnamon Buns\\"  These were to die for!  The book also gave helpful hints; like if you wanted to have the cinnamon buns for breakfast you could leave them to rise overnight in the fridge.  It gave a blurb about where in the Harry Potter Series the food item had been mentioned.  Finally, it gave a trivia note about cinnamon.    To sum it all up, the recipes are fun, unique, easy and above all delicious!  This is a cookbook any Harry Potter fan will love and get a ton of use out of.          P.S. If you like the idea of food made from scratch without chemicals and preservatives this is your book
0792838769|5.0|I'm going to review Tomorrow Never Dies released in 1997.Directed by Roger Spottiswoode who is a hit or miss director he directed Terror Train The Pursuit Of DB Cooper Air America but he was also responsible for Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot & The 6th Day. It stars Pierce Brosnan as James Bond Judi Dench reprises her role as does Desmond Llewlyn Jonathon Pryce as Elliot Carver, Michelle Yeoh as Wai Lin, Teri Hatcher as Paris Carver, Gotz Otto as Stamper, Joe Don Baker makes a small apperance as well. Story is Media Moguel Elliot Carver has a US Military Encoder he has stolen & has plans to provoke a war between the UK & China. MI6 is investigating which the US only gives them 48 hours & they send 007 in Bond notices something odd about the news paper that Carver owns Tomorrow released a story about 17 Brithish Sailors murdered only 3 hours after it happened they want Bond to investigate Carver cause he had a relationship with Paris Carver who is Elliot's wife. Bond poses as a banker Carver notices that Bond is talking to his wife & he has his hench men beat him up Bond however kicks there a s    s  es & shuts down Carver's speech. Carver wants Bond dead Paris warns him & tells him about his headquarters we get a pretty decent shoot out Bond grabs the decoder he also has a run in with Wai Lin. When Bond goes back to his hotel room he finds that Paris has been killed & he's confronted by Dr. Kuffman & Carver's henchies outside are trying to break into Bond's car to get the decoder it's an entertaining scene the car is only activated by him so he tricks Dr. Kuffman he gets shocked Kuffman says \\"I'm only a professional doing a job.\\" BOND: \\"So am I.\\" boom. Then it goes to a well shot well edited car chase scene. Bond gets in contact with Jack Wade he needs to investigate the wreck of the British Naval ship where he has another run in with Wai Lin then they are captured by Stamper & taken to Carver's new tower in Saigon. Carver is there writing Bond's obituary. We also learnthat Carver & General Chang are working together Carver tells Stamper to torture Bond but they escape & then you get a very good motorcyle chase scene. Then these goons later on show up at Wai Lin's hide out we get they get beat up & they find out that Carver has some kind of Stelth boat that can't be traced they go to Ka Long Bay & then it goes to a very large climatic finish on Carver's Slelth boat. Fun thing the opening arms deal was originally intended for the Living Daylights. It was originally suppose to be called Tomorrow Never Lies. Some of the names were different in the original script. 15 BMW 750's were used during the making of this movie. During rewrites Teri Hatcher & Jonathon Pryce weren't happy with there characters direction promting more rewrites. Most of Hatcher's scenes had to be filmed quickly she later expressed dissatisfaction with her role. Another original title was Tomorrow Never Comes. Anthony Hopkins was originally casted as Elliot Carver but walked out after 3 days. Martin Campbell declined to direct. Pierce Brosnan did a great job again. Jonathon Pryce was good but not as good as Sean Bean. Michelle Yeoh was good. Teri Hatcher says expressed dissatisfaction with her role but honestly this is 1 of her better roles. Joe Don Baker wasn't in it a whole lot but he did good for what he had to do. Gotz Otto played it straight he didn't ham it up. Judi Dench was good. Desmond Llewlyn you can't go wrong with him. This was Roger Spottiswoode's best movie. It is a more gadget oriented Bond movie but it's still great. I've still got the VHS of this movie I don't have the DVD or a Blu Ray of it & the cover is all beat to s hi t cause I've had it since 98. There was also a game to the Playstation which I'll review.  So if you liked Golden Eye Tomorrow Never Dies is worth you're time.

B004EI7386|5.0|This album is amazing. Always been a fan of Daft Punk and movie scores, so this is a dream come true. The orchestra goes perfect with DP's electronic beats.<br />Well worth the money.
B001TH8UUA|4.0|Although I am somewhat of an audio/videophile, I am perfectly pleased with these cables. I have purchased two from Amazon and both are of good quality construction and match national brands easily in this dept.

1593272200|5.0|Obviously in a book this large and including so much information, it is difficult to comment on the complete book after I've only had it for a couple of weeks, but from the parts I've looked at closely, it is terrific and a complement to APUE.  As one example, I've had to look at how login accounting works, and APUE has less than a page on this with no detail at all, but TLPI has a 15 page chapter which was very helpful.  I look forward to using this book to illuminate some of the other dark corners (for me at least) of Linux.
B004BC7MRM|4.0|I was never a big Kid Rock fan. I thought he was cool when he first came out, but his shtick got old pretty quick. So, when I saw that Amazon had his new album on sale, I was skeptical. I thought it was on sale because it was a subpar release. Thankfully, I was wrong.<br /><br />Once I heard that Rick Rubin - the mastermind who produced two of Neil Diamond's best pieces of work (e.g., 12 Songs and Home Before Dark) - was behind this album, I was interested. Rick Rubin has a way of bringing out the best in a singer. When it came to Neil Diamond, he produced two gritty, raw albums that highlighted Neil Diamond's unmistakable voice. In this case, Kid Rock's soulful sound and carefree attitude are on full display.<br /><br />Kid Rock has a heck of a voice, and he clearly has a soft spot for classic rock and country music. If you like the Eagles or Bob Seger, you'll probably like this collection of music. These songs are perfect for a road trip, and the moment the title song begins, you know you're in for a fun ride. My other favorite songs include: Slow My Roll, Care, When It Rains, and God Bless Saturday.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fun rock album, with a little bit of country thrown into the mix, you won't be disappointed with this album. It's definitely worth the price of admission.
B003NFM3JK|4.0|I thought this movie was pretty good. Don't really understand why there are so many negative reviews about this movie. I understand that some people were upset cause they thought this was a kid movie, but it does have a PG rating which is a warning to keep little kids away. I thought it was well done and worth watching, now buying at full price, not so much. Maybe when it drops down some.
0307454541|5.0|Great story. Page turner with lots of twists and turns. The setting is Sweden which adds interest. Has some graphic violence but that did not taint the book for me.  I would not have been able to watch this in movie form (due to the violence). This had some mystery centering around a murder and some corporate espionage. A good mix of characters - many characters especially in one family but they had a diagram of the family tree so it was easier to keep track of all the characters.
142311339X|5.0|I will not be including any spoilers. I have to say though that the manner in which the characters where introduced left open for a lot of speculation of what would happen next. The pacing was one again well done and gave the reader a chance to see some of what might be coming and there is a great bit of foreshadowing so I am waiting for the next book to come out in 2011, I would say this would be great for a Sunday quick read for anyone that is interested in mythology.
144471032X|5.0|The Dukan Diet was developed in France, and while somewhat similar to the Atkins Diet, it is not the same diet at all! I like it that Dr. Dukan is very precise in what you can and cannot eat, making it simple to plan, and prepare for succeeding at weight loss. There is research and medical testing, which scientifically back up the effectiveness of this diet. I like it that he gives you a lifetime plan, so you can retain your weight loss with ease. Having gained a full understanding of the diet, I am ready to begin, and confident I will meet my goal, and stabilize my weight.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This is the album many people like to hate. Kelly Clarkson caught alot of heat for releasing this album because it didn't follow the more succesful formula of her last mega hit album \\"Breakaway.\\"  She wrote or co-wrote all of the songs and presents a more edgy, personal and less hit oriented album. Personally I like this album. I can play it from beginning to end and there are some songs that could have been huge hits if her record label had supported this record more. \\"One Minute\\" should have been the first hit released instead of \\"Never Again\\" and \\"Sober\\" and \\"Irvine\\" definitley had hit potential as they showcase her incredible voice and range.   Clarkson has proved over and over that she's no one hit wonder and her voice smokes all the other female singers out today. She can sing every style and doesn't have to strain to hit many notes the others have to scream to reach. She's not a one dimensional singer like many others.  As much as I loved her second album \\"Breakaway\\" and really like hew newest \\"All I Ever Wanted\\", I'm always drawn back to \\"MY December\\" because of it's more serious tone and proof this girl can do all and do it well.
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|This movie has become one of my most favorites! I am a big Jim Carrey fan, and this movie was exceptional! This is a must have for people of all ages!
B003TEO3EI|5.0|Absolute great. They have the musicalty off the past albums combined with a new open, and bombastic sound - you can like the old Blind Guardian Albums, or the new Blind Guardian Albums - both are assume!
B003TML0VO|4.0|I know there are a lot of mixed reviews of this CD, but I like it. I think the arrangements are cool. The guitar playing is pretty sloppy, and sometimes over played, but the vibe of the CD is great, and I liked the song selections and guest vocalists. From a musical standpoint, maybe it's not Carlos' best, but for as an enjoyable CD, I think it ranks high.
B00447G2T8|5.0|Come on! Helloween can play power metal on flutes, and it would be still metal! Fast, fat and open sound, heavy riffing - it's all you caan want from this band! 20 Years Helloween - I can't belive it!
B003XQRZ7E|2.0|I was pretty excited when I heard about Black Country Communion and my expectations were really high. Unfortunately I don't think this CD delivers. The band is great, but I don't think the songs are good enough. After several weeks I feel like I'm forcing myself to listen to it.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I had a copy of this movie that got lost during a recent move and was thrilled to be able to replace it.  I love this movie and could watch it over and over.  In fact I have!  I think the singing is amazing and was quite pleasantly surprized by Butler's vocal range despite his not having any formal training.  I have had friends that have criticized his singing compared to the other lead characters.  I on the other hand felt that, intentional or not, it was very appropriate that the Phantom's singing did not match the other's as his character was not an opera member but a mentor of Christine.  As the saying goes, \\"those that can't, teach\\".  Minnie Driver's prima donna character lends a wonderful sense of fun to the movie.  Don't miss her solo song at the end of the movie. I had the privilege to be able to see The Phantom performed in Las Vegas last year and felt that the singing on the DVD was far superior.  If you like opera, amazing set design or are a fan of Gerard Butler I would highly reccommend this movie.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|My only gripe is that much of the music from the original series has been removed due to copyrights/cost.    Otherwise, I love that this set doesn't play the entire theme before every episode.  This would be a great gift. So fun to sit down and watch one of my favorite shows from the 90s.
0765326353|5.0|I've read most of his other stuff...and this is of the same quality, if not a little better...a little more subtle maybe. anyhow, I'm a fan and think it's great.
B001TH8UUA|1.0|Great price.  The picture makes the cable look thicker than what it really is but you can only match the price during black friday so overall its a great buy    Update  The cable worked great for a few days then it crapped out. After looking at the reviews it seems that a certain percentage of the Amazon Basic cables tend to fail, I guess I got a bad one.  I didn't want to risk it so I went with Mediabridge it works great.  Hate to rag on Amazon, love their great prices.
B000P0J09M|1.0|Got a great deal on this movie!  1.99 I believe.  However, got the disk and more then half way through it went black!  Realized that it was a double sided disk and it really disappointed me.  Love the movie!  Hate how it's a 2 sided disk.
0143034901|5.0|Zafon has penned a truly entertaining novel that will challenge your powers of deduction until the very end.  Set in post-World War II Barcelona, the story begins with a special trip to a bookstore, but not just any bookstore, it is the Cemetery of Forgotten Books.  The main character, Daniel and his father visit the bookstore late one night so Daniel can pick out a special book for his birthday.  Once the book is chosen, Daniel promises his father that he will become the guardian of the book.  After getting lost in the stacks, he comes across Shadow of the Wind a novel by Julian Carax.  With this being his chosen book, he spends the remainder of the night reading Shadow of the Wind and becomes entranced and spellbound by its world.  A few days later, Daniel and his father meet up with another bookseller, Barcelo, who immediately recognizes the novel as a rare book.  Barcelo relates the urban legend of a mysterious man who has traveled Europe in search of novels by Julian Carax and then immediately burns the books he acquires.  Barcelo offers to buy the book from Daniel, but he refuses any sum that Barcelo offers.  Thus begins Daniel's unforgettable adventure through the damp, dark, mystical streets of Barcelona, where Daniel's life begins to strangely parallel that of Julian Carax.<br /><br />Any further information from here would simply spoil the plot.  The prose of this novel is elegant, imaginative and highly readable.  There are twists and turns in every chapter.  I usually read a book only once, but I plan on reading this one again a couple of years down the road.  The second time I read this novel I plan to have a notebook and pen handy, because throughout the book there are a number of introspective quotes that inspired me to reread and ponder how it relates to my life.  I would recommend that you read this book slowly and carefully and also keep a notebook or highlighter nearby.  I look forward to reading Zafon's other novels and highly recommend Shadow of the Wind.Wind.
B00436GNVC|4.0|\\"Endlessly\\" finds Duffy hooking up with the legendary Albert Hammond (understandably), Stuart Price (surprisingly), and Hip Hop collective The Roots on rhythm section.<br /><br />The result is a subtle tweak to her retro Pop/Soul sound, opening with the upbeat synth-driven \\"My Boy\\" which still sounds very sixties. Still keeping the tempo up are the ultra catchy \\"Keeping My Baby\\" (a song on single motherhood), the funky horn-peppered \\"Well Well Well\\" (with nice stop/start effects), the synth/string-swathed \\"Lovestruck\\" (Stuart Price's electronics on display), and the bouncy \\"Girl\\".<br /><br />For ballads, there's the doo wop \\"Too Hurt To Dance\\", the absolutely lovely \\"Don't Forsake Me\\", the acoustic \\"Endlessly\\" (with vinyl scratches added for that retro effect), the gently swaying \\"Breath Away\\", and the sweeping \\"Hard For The Heart\\".<br /><br />Not as instant as her debut, there isn't a \\"Mercy\\" or \\"Warwick Avenue\\" for example, and she does sound a wee bit \\"squeakier\\" this time around, but a logical and enjoyable continuation to her sound.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a surprisingly amazing DVD workout. I was skeptical at first--could a 20 minute workout REALLY change my body?--but I have been impressed with the results. I thought I would share exactly what this workout has done for me.<br /><br />I had a baby about a year ago, and though I was able to shed about 20 lbs., I had another 15 lbs. to go. I have worked out with Jillian for a little less than a month and a half, and I do it four days a week. So far, I have lost 4.5 lbs. and went from a size 8 (sometimes 10) to a 6 (sometimes 4). My abs are waaaay more tone, though I still have remnants of my post-baby pooch (boo).<br /><br />The biggest change I appreciate is that my hips are a lot stronger. After I had my son, I noticed I would get hip cramps, almost like charlie horses, whenever I had to balance on one leg or lift up on one leg. But those pains are gone now. My legs and hips feel very strong. My arms have also become more tone, though they aren't what they were pre-baby. I am doing Workout 3 now, so I think my arms will be getting more tone soon.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great DVD that gets results. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quick workout that works.

B0037KMHRY|5.0|Let me just start out by stating that Daft Punk is/are my favorite artist(s).  I own literally everything they've ever done.  Everything from official releases, to live concert recordings, to dozens of other various bootlegs.  So needless to say, when I heard they were approached to compose the score for the upcoming Tron Legacy film I was beyond ecstatic.  As a child I grew up watching the movie Tron many times but it never really stuck with me compared to the likes of other sci-fi films such as Star Wars, Alien etc..  Tron's original soundtrack by Wendy Carlos never left an impression with me either even being a film score and electronica fanatic.  Now, times have changed and Daft Punk has blessed us with the Tron Legacy score.  No strangers to film, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo have the combined talents of film production, cinematography and film score composition all under their belts.  This is all in addition to their enormous amount of material released under the Daft Punk name as well as many others.  Bangalter also composed the score to French film, Irr&eacute;versible in 2002.  de Homem-Christo has also worked as a film director in addition to his music production.  Together, over the last 17+ years Daft Punk has produced some of the most brilliant and timeless electronic music enthusiasts like myself have ever heard.  I still remember being completely floored the very first time I listened to their \\"Homework\\" album.  Tron Legacy is their first collaboration in years and I'm happy to report that it delivers.  Faithful to the Tron style, if fits the theme of the film flawlessly in every way.  Here are my thoughts and track ratings on Daft Punk's \\"Tron Legacy\\" soundtrack;<br /><br />1.  Overture  8/10 (Grand and sweeping orchestral theme)<br />2.  The Grid  8/10 (Jeff Bridges vocal samples over an intro track)<br />3.  The Son of Flynn  8/10 (Melodic synthesizer)<br />4.  Recognizer  10/10 (Epic and moving electronic strings and horns)<br />5.  Armory  8/10 (Slow soundscape)<br />6.  Arena  8/10 (Building synth and drum track)<br />7.  Rinzler  10/10 (Fast paced building drum, string and synth track)<br />8.  The Game Has Changed  10/10 (A perfect blend of tracks 4 & 7)<br />9.

B0030ZOYHC|4.0|this is really quick review. I picked this up on sale for $10 and watched it because i really loved the whole TV series and i was told this would be a re-amp but its almost identical to down to the words. If i didn't know better i would think they are releasing it on Blu-ray as 4 movies instead of a TV boxset for more money. I kid you not there is NOTHING new or different than the old Show. okay maybe the explosions looks cleaner and not hand-drawn but i kinda missed it.    don't buy this unless A) you willing to wait till 2014 for all the movies and B) don't own the TV series.
B0006J28MI|4.0|Good movie for kids and adults alike.  All the actore, including the dog play their characters well.  A movie that the whole family can enjoy together.
B002ZG99A4|1.0|I have seen some crap movies lately, but wow! This one is the worst. Thought it would be cool to see all these action stars in one film, then I quickely realized none of them can act. I left the movie theatre 3/4 of the way through the movie, just staying that long was hard. If you can listen to a never ending series of one liners, a beyond retarded plot and horrible cg this is your movie. I like to think my one star is for the return of Dolph and the drinking game you could prob make out of the one liners.
1449536689|4.0|A previous reviewer notes that he became a fan of Victorian literature in his 70's. I am in my 60's, and have become a fan of the same due to my recent purchase of a Kindle. I am a lifelong reader. I bought the Kindle so I could pack a single \\"book\\" for a recent trip to Rome, rather than loading down my luggage with 6 or 7 as is usual on a trip. Then, being frugal (and the trip to Rome costing a pretty penny), I started downloading free books to my new Kindle. The great majority of these are works that are in the public domain, many of them from the Victorian era. Using this method, I downloaded a bunch of them, and to date have read Dracula (excellent!), The Home Life of Poe (like an extended People magazine interview), and The Moonstone (see herein).<br /><br />I read Wilkie Collins as a girl, but so long ago that I don't remember if it was Woman in White, or The Moonstone, or both which I read.  The Moonstone, I must confess, is a thoroughly engaging piece of mystery writing.<br /><br />Collins uses the device of having the narrative told by several different first person narrators. In this, the book is like Dracula, whose story is told completely in letters, diary/journal entries, and newspaper clippings. In The Moonstone, the narratives are written after the mystery has been solved, to fulfill a request that each person who had witnessed key moments having to do with the mystery put down in writing only what they witnessed and observed. The individuals of whom this request is made then consult not just their memories but also their own diaries and household records, to put together testimony written after the fact which maintains the urgency and freshness of the original sources, with a bit of reflection by each narrator which nevertheless never provides plot spoilers.<br /><br />Other reviewers have written about Gabriel Betteridge, the valued and loyal major domo of the Verinder household, and about Miss Clack, the hilariously clueless spinster cousin who is a Peerless Evangelizer of the Christian Gospel in her own mind. These narrators are indeed wonderful. From Betteridge, we receive our best portrait of Sergeant Cuff -- \\"the mighty Cuff\\" -- the police detective hired to discover who stole the Moonstone after the local authorities botch the job badly. Althought Sergeant Cuff gets to narrate a very small part of the story himself, it is in Betteridge's chronicle that we get the pleasure of making the acquaintance of a detective who has the idiosyncrasies of Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple, Nero Wolfe et al, even though he is not as central to the story as those worthies.<br /><br />Ezra Jennings is a melancholy character who enters the story in its later chapters. It was his narrative that I found most exceptionally stirring. Jennings is a physician's assistant with a checkered past and a foreign demeanor, treated as an outsider and trusted by few.<br /><br />Rosanna Spears, a hunch-backed maid taken into the Verinder household after a stint in a woman's reformatory, is another melancholy character whose actions stem from motives that transcend class or station in life. I confess that in her story I found myself angriest at the rigid class distinctions that in every generation predispose some folks to fortune and some to misfortune - the Victorians had no monopoly on this any more than do we. Rosanna suffered the double whammy of poverty and feminine ugliness.  If Rachel Verinder has been a servant but retained all of her beauty, her fate would have gone better than Rosanna's, just as Rosanna would have had a better (if not happier) life if she had been an heiress with a humb-back.<br /><br />The Moonstone has all the ingredients of a delicious mystery tale -- adventure, romance, a MacGuffin that is the priceless jewel of a centuries-long-worshiped idol, murder, theft, passion, coincidence misinterpreted, and Robinson Crusoe.

0743277465|5.0|Not only inspirational and poignant but also great ideas in learning philosophy. Mastering a skill is contingent largely on the methods you use to do it and a good way to discover those methods is by modeling the practices and habits of some one who has already achieved mastery. Waitzkin has made it even easier for us by taking time to be introspective about the mastery process and then share his insights with us. If you have never been on the arduous journey of skill mastery it may be difficult to identify with his advice. However, as a lifelong musician, language-learner, and all-around skill acquirer, I could readily see how the underlying principles of learning that he talks about apply  to mastering any skill set. Overall, a compelling read for anyone, and especially thought-provoking for those trying to reach mastery of their craft, whatever it may be.
B000IFQLLY|3.0|The thing about Depeche Mode is while they did have elements of pop, they were artistic at the same time. They had a charm to them and a flavor that was simply their own. There have been three collections: 'Catching up With Depeche Mode,' 'The Singles 81>85' and 'The Singles 86>98.' This one, 'The Best of Volume 1' tries to condense all three into one. And it does not fail, but it does not necessarily succeed, either.    What made both 'The Singles' albums great is that the listener could hear the evolution of Depeche Mode. You could hear how they started -- as a synthpop-influenced but still new wave type of group (on 'Singles 81>85') to a mature, more alternative rock sounding group in the '90s. 'The Best of Volume 1' is all over the place, and it does not paint a consistent picture of what this band was like.    The album has the classics. 'Just Can't Get Enough,' 'Personal Jesus,' 'Enjoy the Silence,' 'Everything Counts' and so on. That's great. BUT WHY COULDN'T THE RECORD COMPANY PUT IT IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER??? On some collections, a smattering of tracks works (see 'A Decade of Steely Dan 1972-1980' -- on that album, the order -- despite it not being chronological -- is perfect, as each song flows nicely into one another). Here, it doesn't. We go from 'Personal Jesus' to 'Just Can't Get Enough.' See? IT DOESN'T FLOW SMOOTHLY. It just seems like a hodgepodge iTunes playlist submitted to a record company and released.    Overall, Depeche Mode are a great band, and if you like new wave and you haven't checked them out, do so immediately. These guys are great band, with great songwriting and great instrumentation too. Buy 'The Best of Volume 1' if you are in the mood for a very quick and dirty look at the group, but otherwise 'Singles 81>85' and 'Singles 86>98' are recommended (as well as their studio albums -- most of which range from very good to excellent).     Not a bad compilation, but you could do MUCH, MUCH better.
B0044KU7KU|3.0|listening to this was like listening to 21st Century Breakdown all over again, i jumped on the MCR bandwagon back when they first broke out in 2005, and i have to admit Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge is still one of my favorite albums. But they polarized a lot of fans with The Black Parade. It was different, and a huge career risk. What did i think of it? loved it. Four years later, i finally get to hear a new MCR album, and just like 21st Century Breakdown, high expectations ruined this album. I don't think its bad, but it's far from the bands best effort. It's painfully overproduced, filled with power ballads and...um.. a dance song or two, this is a \\"safe rock album\\". It's not all duds though, \\"DESTROYA\\", \\"Bulletproof Heart\\", and closer \\"Vampire Money\\" still have the urgency the band once had, while other songs sound like 30SecondsToMars/Angels and Airwaves mashups. Remember the song \\"When Worlds Collide\\" by Powerman 5000? well \\"Planetary (GO!)\\" sounds like Panic At The Disco covering that song. I hated this at first but i've given it a chance and it did sort of grow on me, You just got to accept it for what it is. I Just hope the band doesn't go down the path Green Day has started to, because theres a lot of potential with these guys.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|Watching the \\"Daria\\" DVDs took me back to my college days.  (I'd graduated from high school a few years before the show's premiere in 1997, but I could relate to her on so many levels.)  I thought I'd wait until I watched all eight DVDs before commenting ... and now that I've done so -- over a period of a few weeks -- here's my review:    The best part of \\"Daria\\" is some episodes are STILL culturally relevant -- \\"Gifted\\" explored what it meant to feel alienated by her fellow intellectuals, and \\"Fizz Ed\\" was a scathing commentary on vending machines in schools.  However, it \\"jumped the shark\\" with the introduction of Tom at the end of season three.  (I understand the need for conflict to maintain a storyline ... but his presence seemed contrived at best, and forced at worst.)  Daria was a loner at heart (see \\"Camp Fear\\"), and the show was at its best when she was forced to confront her occasional bouts of hypocrisy (see \\"See Jane Run\\") -- besides, everyone knows her soulmate wasn't Mr. Sloane, but Holden Caulfield (LOL).    Having \\"Daria\\" in its entirety -- along with the special features -- is a plus, but there are a few minuses.  Unlike most fans, my biggest gripe isn't about the music ... but the lack of a booklet with information on each episode.  [...]  Also, the introductions didn't add anything to the \\"Daria\\" experience.  Finally, the DVD case was poorly manufactured; it broke as soon as I opened it.  (Had I paid the original price instead of waiting a few months and paying $[...], I would've been pissed!)    In closing, I'm glad to have the DVDs, for \\"Daria\\" mastered the art of capturing teen angst.

B0041VV03A|1.0|my selection for the worst movie of the new millenium. too bad to be camp, it must have been written by a committee of illiterate studio executives who stole sundry pieces of horror flicks starting with species.     nothing original here except perhaps the creature's legs but i'm confident most adolescent boys weren't looking at delphine chanéac's legs. it's apparent from the movie's poster who they were marketing this movie to and ms. chanéac obviously wasn't hired for her acting skills.     david hewlett regurgitates his role from stargate atlantis as the neurotic scientist. adrien brody who phoned this one in from another planet seems distracted. must have been reading predators' script ... or doing his taxes. poor sarah polley puts so much effort into over-acting her every scene, it feels like she's over-acting the scenes she's not in.    there is no coherence in the actors' performances. it's almost as if they were working from different scripts.    the only value here is a cautionary tale to all those adolescent lads who wasted an hour and a half sitting through this: DON'T SCREW THE LAB EXPERIMENTS!!!!

B003UCPEJ2|5.0|This generous 60-CD set met or exceeded my every expectation for performance and recorded sound, based on the Living Stereo recordings I already own. The original art work, well-constructed case, and splendid 246-page booklet add further value.<br /><br />This set is a compelling historical document of a musical world now gone. It gives an idea of what the core symphonic repertoire was like a half-century ago-- the music which orchestras performed for paying audiences-- and how that has gradually changed. It is also a portrait of two great orchestras (Chicago and Boston) led by two legendary conductors (Reiner and Munch) at the peak of their powers. They, and their soloists (vocal and instrumental) and orchestra members were the last generation of classical musicians who first encountered the music they played by reading scores or hearing live performances, rather than through others' recordings. This, I believe, accounts for the extra measure of individuality and freshness found in many Living Stereo performances and so often lacking in today's generic recordings-- no matter how sexed-up the cover art, or technically \\"perfect\\" the performance and digital sound may be. Even so, few allowances need to be made here for sound quality, and are more than compensated by the quality of performance.<br /><br />This set also serves as a reminder of cultural barriers still very much in place 50 years ago-- between high culture and popular culture, between \\"real\\" classical music and \\"light classics\\". Arthur Fiedler said that his greatest professional disappointment was that, because of his association with the \\"middle-brow\\" Pops, he was never invited to conduct the Boston Symphony Orchestra. A few fine recordings by Fiedler and the Boston Pops, and by Morton Gould and his Orchestra, round out this set.<br /><br />I downloaded these discs onto my iPod, and will also listen in my car (and cancel an expensive satellite radio subscription.) In one year, this set will pay for itself on that count alone.<br /><br />This is a great opportunity and value not to be missed. (Many of the recordings in the set are not currently available as individual CDs.) As with any collection, it is possible to find better performances of some individual pieces, but the over-all quality and historic significance are beyond dispute.<br /><br />Now that Mercury Living Presence has issued Volume Two of its boxed set, when is Living Stereo going to follow suit?<br /><br />Update added April 21, 2014: Living Stereo Collection Vol. 2 is available for pre-order and is set for release on May 13, 2014.
1594484775|4.0|If you've had the pleasure of reading Nick Hornby once, it's hard to imagine not wanting to read all of his subsequent works.  Certainly that is true of me, and I've finally had the chance to read his latest, Juliet, Naked.  I don't know that this surpasses his very strongest work, but in no way does that imply that it is anything less than delightful.<br /><br />Juliet, Naked is the story of three people.  At the very center is Annie.  Annie has been in a 15-year-relationship with Duncan.  Duncan's not a bad guy, but perhaps the most notable thing about him is his obsessive fandom for a long-retired, minor musician named Tucker Crowe.  Tucker is the third character in this triangle.  We get one picture of Tucker's life and art through Duncan's smitten (and ignorant) eyes, but we are also privy to the reality, which is quite a bit different.<br /><br />That is the set-up.  Once we've met all the players, there is a catalyst that results in two major plot developments.  The catalyst is the release of Tucker Crowe's album Juliet, Naked, a new, stripped-down version of his classic album, Juliet.  It's the first anyone's heard from Crowe in 20 years, and the reception is polarizing.  So much so, that it's the straw that breaks the back of Annie and Duncan's relationship.  The other major, if improbably, development is that Annie and Tucker strike up a friendship.  The novel is a warm, funny, affectionate look at three flawed individuals.  Despite their flaws, it's hard not to fall in love with them.  I can think of any number of less pleasant things to do than while away a few hours in their company.
0061433047|5.0|Tiffany Aching has spent half her life finding out what she knows about being a witch. At age 8 she witnessed what happens when a community turns on someone branded a witch, and she determined it would never happen again if she had anything to do about it. As it turns out, she could do quite a lot.<br /><br />  Not by magic so much, as knowing how NOT to use magic to do what needs to be done. Learning the harder thing - people - and seeing what IS rather than what people would like to see. Having Second Thoughts - and sometimes Third and Fourth Thoughts. Always having a piece of string handy. And of course there are her friends, the Nac Mac Feegles, tremendous trouble in a deceptively small package who are determined to protect their \\"Big Wee Hag\\" - no matter how embarrassing and inconvenient their help might be.<br /><br />  After 8 years studying under senior witches, including the formidable Granny Weatherwax, Tiffany has gained a great deal of experience - and continued to develop her skills as a cheesemaker. As this latest tale opens, at 16 she is now a full time practicing witch on her own steading, her beloved homeland of the Chalk. While she's taken up the pointy hat as a mark of her calling, she has yet to formally adopt the black attire of her trade. She's almost too busy seeing to all the things regular people tend to let slide, caring for injuries, settling disputes, and otherwise trying to head off the problems no one else takes time to see. And then things start going wrong. (There's always a test when you're a witch.)<br /><br />  Her relationship with the Baron's son has taken a turn neither saw coming; she's fighting a losing battle to keep the baron in good health; a local girl undergoes a horrible experience which she tries to deal with as best she can. Mind, this would be all in a day's work for a witch - but on top of it something ancient and dark is creeping up on her, accompanied by troubling omens. Anti-witch sentiments begin to appear - and Tiffany finds she is becoming a target.<br /><br />  Without giving too much away, this is a tale where the saga of the young girl Tiffany Aching becomes the tale of Tiffany Aching the young woman. She faces tests of adulthood that will either destroy her, or confirm her as the witch - and the Tiffany Aching - she has always striven to be. This tale is classic Pratchett and a fitting capstone to the tales of young Tiffany. There are some brief cameos by other great characters Pratchett has created when the story carries Tiffany to Ankh-Morpork briefly, but this is very much her tale. If all the world's a story, as Granny Weatherwax might say, this is one of the better ones to be following.Tiffany finds she is becoming a target.

044656740X|4.0|The book involves a lot of repetition. The author comes across as rich and yet unable or unwilling to explain exactly how and why. But it's a start. There are some good stories here... if this guy would write an autobiography, it would be a delight. Average of one decent knowledge-dense sentence per page. Easy to speed read. Very poor diagram illustrations. No notations, one page of semi-useful references. Briefly presents perhaps six actual asset development strategies -- as in, this is not a how-to book.

Above average music, acting, story, and production values, but that's not saying much I guess... nothing to be embarrassed about if you're caught watching this, but not much to be proud of. There were nice touches through-out, but partly the main man was a bit fake, partly it was all just outside my income bracket so I couldn't relate very well, and then there were a lot of 5 and 10 and 30 second cuts that were fluff.<br /><br />Of course the leading lady is hot hot. And all the fluff... those are good moments to squeeze your date's hand, or something other than a hand, and make out.<br /><br />I was actually worried this movie would be packed with clever ideas for getting and keeping the girl, but it really wasn't.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|This headset is the best investment I've made for my PS3 besides Call of Duty!! The sound quality is AMAZING!!!! No tiny sounding explosions or super high-pitched gunshots. Every sound is perfectly balanced and really helps you hear what you're supposed to hear. There are two bass boost controls, and you can literally feel the rumble in your chest (Not sure how Turtle Beach managed that lol). It feels like you are really in a room surrounded by speakers!! I generally play in my room late at night, and this normally isn't very conducive to the sleeping patterns of my family ;-). Now, I can play all night, with the volume as loud as I want in my ears, and no one else even knows I'm awake. Being able to independently control the chat and game volumes makes this headset a winner. It may take a little fiddling around with, but it won't take long before you find the perfect mix of chat and game volume. I also love that the headset is extremely lightweight; this eases any wear on your ears and neck during those long gaming sessions. It doesn't seem flimsy or cheaply made though. The mic is nice and clear according to my PSN friends and can be muted with the click of a switch.     I definitely recommend this headset. It was an upgrade for me because my audio set-up in my room isn't even surround sound, so I'd rather use the headset even if everyone was gone from the house.
B00002DF4X|2.0|The first several tracks on the CD have the song title and artist offset by one.  So when you play it in a modern CD player or load it into iTunes, the tracks are mislabeled.  For example, track 3 has the name and artist for track 2.  The company is in Argentina.  I think that it's just a bootleg copy that was burned poorly.  The songs are all there though.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I wholeheartedly agree with Phoenix Child.  Desplat's melody is so beautiful and perfect that it should have been/be nominated for an  Academy Award as Bella's Lullaby should have as well.    My annoyance so far with the Twilight Saga is that there should have been a carryover musical theme - the above two would be perfect so that these two melodies become the symbol for this entire franchise.    I will say that the single that has stayed with me - besides the  two named above is \\"Possibility\\" ... it seems stuck in my head - which means to me that this song is first class.    My adult children are amazed at my attachment to the soundtracks for these movies, but there hasn't been anything this good in maybe 30 years?      Money well spent.  Again.
1439177783|5.0|Highly recommended reading. But, nothing about her is real...including her name. She is always acting the part so how can you tell if the book is real? I am a true sceptic so it is interesting, but just a little unbelievable. If even half of this book is true, she is a very fortunate woman to have found Ellen.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The third year is the funniest yet. I love this show and now I love it even more. Buy this season 3...do it!!
B00000IAU3|3.0|The songs \\"Here With Me\\" and \\"My Lover's Gone,\\" especially the latter, are very moving, haunting, and beautiful.  I love them and play them over and over.  I found the rest of the album to be slightly bland though.  \\"Thank You,\\" which was the biggest hit, fell the flattest with me.  My best advice is to listen to the samples to make sure this is for you.
1591795230|5.0|This was an amazing book.  It widened my understanding of how the concsious and the unconscious mind influence our daily life and what happens simultaneously in the physical world scientifically.  I highly recommend it.  I have listened to it several times so far and am amazed everytime.

B003NEVVSU|4.0|The enticement for me to buy this release was being able to replace my tired old VHS of the 1979 Azure d'Or promo film found on disk two. The video is obviously a straight transfer from VHS using the best quality source they could find, and some may quibble that they should have looked harder for a better original, but I have a feeling what they used is about as good as it gets. I won't speak to the merits of the audio portion of the package since I'm no audiophile, but to my ears the Scheherazade album sounds as good as the CD I'm replacing. So as far as I'm concerned this is a win-win purchase.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|Let this serve as a warning to the brave few who have managed to avoid watching this film so late in the game... DON'T DO IT !!! I finally got around to watching this film, after hearing a constant stream of praise for it from friends and co-workers for probably over a year now. Despite all of the constant praise I heard, something in my subconscious was telling me \\"Do not even bother with this film\\", and let me tell you, I should've listened to myself. This film was just atrocious, and I will never trust in James Cameron again, because his last two major releases were total stinkers, regardless of how much money they may have made. First of all, there is absolutely no substance in this film.  The story itself is so cliche and predictable that it made me cringe. This plot has been done about a thousand times before, usually in Disney films.  There is nothing new here story wise, and it is painfully obvious that all of the efforts in making this film were put into the visual effects. Unfortunately, the visual effects were not very good!  I found the Avatars to be fake looking and totally distracting. There really weren't any great set pieces that grabbed me. It was way too long and about two thirds of the movie had me bored to tears. I literally was smacking myself in the face about halfway through the movie struggling to stay awake...Just hoping for that big payoff in the end. Never got it. The fact that this film had enough repeat viewers to earn the number one all-time rank in the box office has me questioning the current state of humanity.  How could anyone sit through this more than once? It's like digital vallium. If you really need to see an over-hyped, big special effects movie, rent Inception instead.  Not the best film out there, but certainly light years ahead of this.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I have enjoyed all of three of the Toy Story movies.  Well, written, funny and beautiful graphics.  Loved it.
1400079144|2.0|Not that great. That about sums up my opinion of the latest book by Dan Brown, The Lost Symbol. It started off quite interesting, but then it quickly fell into a formulaic trap (read: predictable). As a matter of fact, I was able to correctly guess a couple of major plot points just from the first few chapters, which made the rest of the reading thin for me. To his credit, however, Brown did stoke my interest in noetic science, causing me to look it up online and learn a bit about it, along with freemasonry.    I got the sense that Brown was trying too hard with this book, perhaps attempting to eclipse his previous work, The Da Vinci Code, with a far-reaching story that extended beyond religion. What I disliked most about Lost Symbol, however, was that Brown was preaching to the reader at the end of the book, which I consider a cardinal sin in fiction. Fiction is meant to entertain and, at times, enlighten the reader. It's never meant to be used as a means to foist the author's feelings, views, values, and ideas on the reader. It makes him or her look self-righteous, egotistical, and just plain old foolish. Just stick to writing good, fun, and engrossing stories, Mr. Brown, and leave your personal Sunday school teachings behind.
0761158464|5.0|I bought this book on a whim and was surprised by the reaction of my nieces and nephews (ages 10-20).  Everyone just loved the book.  We have an autistic child in the family and he loves Star Wars and he has now claimed ownership of the book.  He loves the way he can control the pictures and movement.  I would strongly recommend to anyone who likes Star Wars.
B00005OCMR|5.0|This movie is dated but it is the blueprint for every awesome epic movie that came after. I got this for like $9.99 last year and all of a sudden its overpriced? why? Hype kills i guess. Disney, we will still watch Tron Legacy after watching the first. Yes we know the movies special effects are laughable in today's standards but that's what made this movie awesome. Light cycles and colors of blue and orange neon bring me back to an era of grand imagination. Not all this Regurgitated BS you see now. A remake of a remake of a remake. Release this on blu ray please! Disney, you could have made so much money this month.
B002ZG99A4|2.0|I wanted to like this film but unfortunately it does not quite cross into even great A-list movie territory. It is missing a strong storyline and character development. The potential is there but the opportunity was missed in favor of non-stop action instead. Not to belittle the action. It was a pleasure to see real stunt work instead of CGI, and one must give kudos to Stallone for attempting to recreate the old time stunt filled action film of past decades. Just for that alone the movie is well worth seeing. As you watch this film, just think about how dangerous these scenes were to film. Too bad that much of the amazing fight scenes at the end of the film is marred by too many fast cut edits which does not give the viewer nearly enough time to digest the extraordinary difficulty of staging these scenes.    A word must also be said about the 3 disk Blu-Ray edition. If you are networked, the Blu-Ray disk makes a connection to the internet. This makes this disk one of the slowest loading Blu-Ray disks I have seen so far. I thought at first that the disk was faulty because there was no on-screen message about what was happening, just a sort of skull icon that if you paid very very very close attention to, indicated that something was being loaded. Secondly, the viewer has to sit through  previews and other commercial messages before getting to the main menu. Skipping them is difficult. No way to avoid this.Third, the standard DVD disk version in the package contains no extras. The featurette available on the regular single DVD edition of the film is not in this set. Also, although the single edition regular DVD contains the gag reel, and one deleted scene that are also on the Blu-Ray edition, none of the more interesting 4 featurettes that are on the Blu-Ray edition are on the regular DVD. There was no reason to exclude them all from the regular DVD. This must be purely a marketing decision to sell Blu-Ray players.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|I'm so dissapointed that it's taken me this long to discover this band. I LOVE this cd. It resembles a Jack White project, which might explain why I love it so much. Great cd for listening to in traffic.
B0043M4HFA|1.0|If Dave Mustaine thinks he's metal and lives the metal life he should take another look in the mirror. There's a reason why Metallica dumped him. He's a self centered, ego maniac who's biggest fan is himself. What a joke. This \\"book\\" is a waste of ink and paper. Keep patting yourself on the back Dave, cause your the only one doing it.
0545265355|5.0|I really like \\"fight the system\\" (to borrow a Netflix genre) books.  I tried to take my time and enjoy these books but right when I'm about to finish a chapter something else pulls me in further.  Highly recommended if you enjoy 1984, Brave New World, etc.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|This album is a thing of beauty.  I saw them in concert and they topped expectations.  My vote for 2010 Album of the Year.

B00005JM02|5.0|This is one of my top three favorite movies. If I could I would give it 6 stars. My husband and I went to see it on a date and I laughed just as hard as all the kids in the movie theatre. LOVE IT!
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|Not what I expected, a lot of nudity.  It did show war in all of it's ugliness, but if you had read the books that it was based on, you would find that the director took some \\"artistic license\\".  I liked Band of Brothers better, but I would recommend this movie to others with warnings.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Come on, who doesn't love Buddy? One of my all time favorite Christmas movies. I try to watch it every year. Always puts a smile on my face.
B000VNMMR0|3.0|This is my least favorite Die Hard (I rank #1 best, #3 second, #2 third, this fourth) but it's still a decent movie.  I prefer ol' McClane to slicker more ninja-like modern heroes, and you probably will too.  He's still reliable as an action lead.  Timothy Olyphant is a good villain and Justin Long is pretty funny and not as irritating as I feared.    Because it falls short, I WOULD have given it two stars.  But in today's world of terrible Indiana Jones 4 and Star Wars prequels, I give this a generally positive \\"three star\\" rating for the sheer fact that it didn't go back in time and ruin the old Die Hard movies like some kind of time-warping Terminator.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I had attempted to read this book awhile back and could not get into it.  Recently I tried again and was immediately hooked.  While it is a fascinating mystery about family secrets it is also a love story.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys mysteries.  It kept me completely involved with all the characters at every turn. Loved it.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The movie was very interesting and informative. It gave information I didn't know although I had read most of the books it was based on. I would recommend it to anyone interested in World War II history.
0143113100|5.0|One of the best books on neuroplasticity. Norman Doidge describes how individuals with deficits (stroke, autism, etc.) have made positive progress thanks to brain re-wiring processes. A book of hope, control and enlightenment: We can all have an impact on our brains. What are the implications for education and society at large? What about people without deficits? What can they do to rewire their brains for the best? This is a very eye-opening book. For more specific guidance on how to put that neuroplasticity to good use, I'd recommend another good recent book, [[ASIN:0982362900 The Sharp Brains Guide to Brain Fitness: 18 Interviews with Scientists, Practical Advice, and Product Reviews, to Keep Your Brain Sharp]].
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I bought this album because I liked \\"Little Lion Man.\\"  This CD is one of those rare treasures that I liked in its entirety from the very first listen.  I don't want to overplay it and get sick of it, so I try to limit myself to listening to the album only once or twice a day.  It's fantastic!
B002ZG981E|5.0|I am a movie buff,so much that I worked at Blockbuster and the main reason for it was the 10 free rentals I recieved a week.   Some people only like certain Genre's of movies but I like all Genre's from movies like Crazyheart or Blindside or to action flicks like Iron Man and the Expendables along with well made comedies like The Hangover and Get him to the Greek and I know that im only speaking to new titles but my point is I love all Genre's.     INCEPTION was not only the best movie I have seen this year,but one of my top 5 of all time for many reasons #1- being such a unique concept that is tough to find nowadays as it seems they are running to situations where they are doing so many remakes of old titles due to lack of creativity. #2-Casting was perfect for the roles they played in the movie and of course Leo Dicaprio (who I have not been the biggest fan of),was incredible and really sold me on his character.     Their are many reasons to watch and own this movie, but if your the type of person who loves basically any genre Christopher Nolan mixed in a balance of action,drama, suspense and a ending that only you can decide...    Buy This movie....
1401323952|5.0|This tome by Nigella Lawson, reads just like how she speaks. Fans of her show will be familiar with her lexicons and luscious way of describing sensations and taste, which she does with such aplomb. All the recipes are easy to follow, and her descriptions about the produce and the background to the recipes and flavours is simply irresistable. Nigella often acknowledges her shortcomings and never claims to be a chef, rather she comes across as a warm and generous entertainer with her home cooked meals.  The only shortcoming I find with my edition, is that is clearly American-ised. In Australia, our cooking terms and ingredient names are more similar to the English (rocket= arugula, coriander= cilantro). Perhaps I had unknowingly purchsed the American version, but nevertheless, this book is highly readable and diet destroying.
0525423273|5.0|My GOD! Best book of all times! I want to read it again and again and want to own like a thousand copies of it! And this never ever happens to me. In all my years of reading, one of the genres that has been constant for me is contemporary. Yet it's hard that a contemporary read stands out to me when it's not dark. Good dark contemporary has been my preference in realistic reads. Sarah Dessen-type reads are good yet just not rave-about good. I love them and love to read them but I don't normally obsess about them. Anna and the French Kiss makes everything I just said complete BS. This is a raving, obsessing, daydreaming, one-of-a-kind read that I wish I could live in and own, and the single book I would take on a deserted island. I could read it over and over and then just read it again.       Stephanie Perkins is my hero. If I have ever idolized an author like no other, it would be her. It is absolutely unbelievable that this is her debut novel. I would and will read anything she ever writes. Her characterization is impeccable. I'm fairly sure all the characters are real. Her witty, fun and perfect writing is makes all my dreams about finding the perfect book come true. She captured teenage romance, teenage insecurities and teenage friendship like no one else does.       The setting is also a high point in this book. Not only is it boarding school, but it's in Paris. You wont be able to say you've never been to Paris after reading this. My mental picture of Paris is clear. I felt I was walking the streets of Paris with Anna. I felt I could smell every scent she smelled. This book is a marvelous atmospheric journey that takes the reader to their teen years and to Paris and back. I will never run out of praise for this book because as Lisa Schroeder said, \\"this is perfection on the page\\".       You must, must, MUST read it!
0316098337|5.0|I finished reading this book about 4 weeks ago and I still think about it every day. It was an amazing, touching, heart-wrenching, incredible story that left me sad at the end because it was over. I didn't want to leave the characters in the story. The story and details are so credible that you wonder if the author didn't really experience this all herself. This  book is a must read. I will reread it for sure, which I have never done with another book.
0061730335|3.0|If you think there is no hope, if you've stopped dreaming, then you need to read this book. This is the story of a boy who had nothing. He lived in conditions most westerners don't even know about. He had to fight and survive famine, drought and extreme poverty. His village had no running water or electricity. While American students are in school, he's working under harsh conditions. He has to educate himself after work. At the age 14, while most kids are playing video games, he builds a windmill to bring electricity to his house.<br />This book is not only inspirational, it is educational as well. You will learn about the culture of Malawi, the language, science, religion, etc. I read this book as a class assignment but this book is geared toward a broader audience than your typical student.
0385342047|4.0|This review was written by my daughter for whom I obtained a copy of MiniShopaholic.<br /><br />I have been a fan of the Shopaholic series since the first book in the series, Confessions of a Shopaholic, came out.  Sophie Kinsella does a great job of getting the reader inside the mind of Becky Brandon (nee` Bloomwood...as she would say!) and you feel you are experiencing everything right along with her.  Becky always seems to get herself into some kind of mess and it is very entertaining seeing how she works her way out of them.<br /><br />In the most recent novel, MiniShopaholic, Becky is back to her usual antics.  She is still happily married to Luke, they are living with her parents while waiting for the sale of their dream house to close, she is working as a personal shopper at a popular department store and they have a 2 year old daughter named Minnie.  Minnie seems to be acquiring the spoiled, shopaholic tendencies of her mother, which is beginning to worry Luke - and causing some animosity towards Luke and Becky since Luke feels that hiring a \\"Super Nanny\\" is necessary.  In addition to the \\"Minnie issues\\", England is experiencing an economic recession forcing people to cut back on their spending - which results in Becky promising Luke she will not shop for herself.  Obviously this is a challenge for Becky!  Becky has also decided to throw Luke a lavish surprise party during the tough financial times which she is determin ed to pull off on her own and prove to everyone that she can do it on a budget.<br /><br />Of course as in all the Shopaholic novels, Becky has to face a milllion different obstacles - most of which she brings on herself - and the reader is taken on a fun adventure trying to see how she gets herself out of trouble.  As I mentioned, Kinsella does a great job of putting the reader inside Becky's head so they feel as though they are along for the ride and she always throws a few surprises in there so just when you think a problem is solved, something else goes wrong!<br /><br />While I enjoyed MiniShopaholic, and would recommend it to other Kinsella fans, I didn't enjoy this book as much as some of the others in the series.  To be honest, while the writing of this novel is up to par with all of the other books in the series, having read all of the other ones, each subsequent Shopaholic book becomes more and more predictable.  You always know all will work out in the end so it makes it less and less exciting to keep reading.  For the other books in the series, I was always excited to pick up the book and was always in a rush to finish it to see what happens.  Reading MiniShopaholic, however, took me quite some time.  In my opinion - this should be the last in the Shopaholic series and Kinsella should now create a new character who we can grow to love as much as we love Becky!g!

B002ZG981E|5.0|We should all stand up and cheer Christopher Nolan (Memento, The Dark Knight) for a number of reasons, whether it be for making spectacular Batman movies or always willing to up the ante in terms providing something rarely seen on the silver screen.  Case in point is Inception, which finds Nolan unfolding a masterfully dizzying and ingenius thriller, in which a master thief named Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) uses technology to invade people's dreams.  Given a seemingly impossible task to pull of \\"an inception\\" for his last shot at redemption, Cobb and his crew find themselves way in over their heads as a battle of mental survival begins to unfold.  For everything that makes Inception so special, from the dazzling effects to the zero-gravity fistfight between Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the film isn't without its flaws.  The multilayered plot can get nigh-incomprehensible, convoluted, and downright confusing, as the film's ideas come close to running away with themselves in full gear and leaving the viewer utterly clueless.  Still though, Inception is the kind of mainstream brain-teasing film that is so incredibly rare to see these days, and it's made all the better by a superbly constructed cast that also includes Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy, Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard, Dileep Rao, Tom Berenger, Pete Postlethwaite, and Lukas Haas.  All in all, you won't see many films like Inception, which is a crying shame, and here's hoping that Christopher Nolan has a few more tricks up his sleeve for the future.
B004FDY4LE|5.0|This is the hands-down, absolute BEST show I have ever seen. I have completely abandoned television so I don't get AMC, and I have never even thought about paying to watch a t.v. show. But after I saw the first episode of The Walking Dead, I HAD to have more!<br />The experience I get when watching this show is much more like being immersed in a really great film. Or a really great book. I have never read the graphic novel, but now I will definitely check it out.<br />The characters and the character development are magnificent. Thoroughly believable and impossible not to empathize with.<br />The camera-work, the environment, the lighting and the seamless effects are very immersive. It makes me feel like I'm there, and the characters help me feel what it is like.<br />The show is dramatic, but in the most realistic way. Their life IS drama. From putting a bullet in a zombie's head to having to put a bullet in your own sister's head when she becomes a zombie. When the walking dead take over the world, people aren't fake anymore and the drama becomes survival, but still holding on to hope.<br />And then there are the zombies. EPIC. The make-up work and special effects are phenomenal. I have seen ALOT of zombies. I am a zombie fan. LOVE zombie movies. These guys nailed it. I not only love the zombies visually, but I love their concept. Sure, the superfast, superhuman zombies can be cool if done right, but zombies who don't really run any faster than the average person are so much more realistic.<br />When the zombie apocalypse comes, I imagine it will be something like this. And this show is breathtaking.
B002R4K6AG|1.0|I love Bob Dylan, but this is a cruel joke.  I didn't read any revues or listen to it prior to purchase.  I wanted to be surprised.  Was I ever!  With the cover art, I expected a folksy, acoustic, retro collection of pure Dylan harkening to his early days.  Why not, the packaging suggested such.  This is an excruciating travesty of what could have been.  Everyone I've played it for has reacted with horror and guffaws.  Neither expression is why we listen to music.

B00000J2SO|5.0|I bought this with some hesitation because several reviewers commented that it marked a commercial turn in Rainbow's sound.  I would say that the new vocalist makes the real difference here.  I love Dio, and I'm not trying to compare the two.    Anyway, if you could imagine Rainbow with Rob Halford at the mike, then you've got a good idea of the overall sound of this CD.  In fact for the longest time I thought Since You've Been Gone was a Judas Priest tune, a second venture along rock and roll lines like Livin' After Midnight on their British Steel Album.  I really can't see commercialism moving in here.  I would say there's maybe a more rock 'n' roll good time sort of overall feel, with somewhat more noticeable blues influence, and of course with the loss of Dio, there's no reference to fantasy and so the album ends up being much, much less of a fantasy sound track (though I do highly, highly recommend Rainbow Rising, which is).  Instrumentally the album has a lot of Rainbow signatures like some use of keyboards, a little middle-eastern sound accented soloing, some galloping riffing, etc.    I would also mention that what may have sounded comparatively commercial thirty, to some--30 or more years ago, wouldn't necessary come across as commercial today.  There is no way, now way, that Down To Earth is a mere 4 star album, and I'm hoping that my rating here will push up the overall rating.  Buy and enjoy!
B000B8QG4A|4.0|Lady and the Tramp is a great Disney classic and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to enjoy quality animation.  The two disc feature is nice and my wife was extremely happy to have it added to her growing Disney collection.  The only reason I would not give 5 stars is that the Disney Vault is complete garbage.  It is ridiculous that fans are expected to wait for the re-release of movies that have been available since the 60's.  This is price gouging at its finest.  The seller I chose was fine and I have no issue with them, but of course anyone selling something that is in the Vault is going to mark it up.

B0043A0PXU|1.0|Annie Lennox sounds more like a Banshee than an angel on this album.  Her voice is so brash that she absolutely ruins the wonderful selection of songs on this album. I love a strong female voice, but Annie sounds forced, loud and harsh.  Annie's voice on the album came as a great shock to this fan. I guess I will pawn this album off on some poor unsuspecting soul, because it will not remain in my collection.

B002H3F7F6|3.0|A couple of things come together to prevent this album from being what one would expect of a Sting album.  While the selection of songs is not bad, it is not outstanding, especially for lovers of medieval and old songs that celebrate the winter or Christmas season.  Also, in several of the songs, Sting seems to be forcing his voice outside its normal range.   And,overall, the pace is too slow.  While most of the songs, taken separately, are okay, when put together on an album, the pace is almost boring.   I admit I am not a die hard Sting fan, but I do love the older, less often sung carols. This album just does not do it for me.
B001C3KCSY|2.0|This album starts strong and then falls apart.  Closer, Crawl, Sex on Fire, and Use Somebody are pretty strong songs.  Kings of Leon definitely has a semi-unique sound in the modern rock scene.  The singer is mostly a one-trick pony, however, and his limited vocal range is exposed on this album.  By the middle of the album, the songs are messy, muddy train-wrecks that go nowhere.  It sounds as if they only had enough good material for an EP, and maybe they shouldn't have ripped off their fans with this album of half-good, half-filler.
1439181780|5.0|I can't say enough good about this book. Once again, Rhonda Byrne has shown us how we can take the gifts within ourselves and put them to work to make a better life. When I first began following Rhonda, I was caught up in mainstream religion, thank goodness I got out of that. Her books have been an EXCELLENT guide in helping me to re-invent my life for the better.<br /><br />Since putting to practice the things talked about in The Secret and The Power, my life has improved ONE THOUSAND fold! There is no more confusion, no more trying to toe an invisible line with ever changing rules, etc. I believe that Rhonda has written two books that literally show people how to transform their lives not just for the better but in an EXTRAORDINARY way, and in this day and age, we can all use a little help!<br /><br />I highly reccomend both of her books, but the Power is really...well...POWERFUL becuase it teaches us how to harness the most important of all of our abilities and that is LOVE!<br /><br />Thank you Rhonda!

0439023513|5.0|The Mockingjay<br />By Suzanne Colllins<br /><br />When I finished book one and two of the Hunger Games, I was able to download the Kindle version of book three, The Mockingjay. I knew I wouldn't want to wait for the book to come in the mail. In this way I was able to feed my hunger for the Hunger Games.<br /><br />War has broken out in the districts and Katniss has been chosen to be the face of the rebellion against the Capital. Her nightmares continue and she can't bear to imagine how Peeta is being treated as a Capital prisoner.<br />The world as she has known it is collapsing around her, she's making promotional videos to bring hope to the suffering districts and only one thought keeps her going, she wishes to kill the President of Penam.<br /><br />This is a fast paced series. You will soon be caught up in the action as well as the lives of the characters. Susanne Collins really knows how to hook her audience and keep them hooked through the entire series.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is definitely a series you won't want to miss! If you order all three books now, you won't have to wait between books.<br /><br />Jill Vanderwood<br />Author: [[ASIN:1439224773 What's It Like Living Green?: Kids Teaching Kids, by the Way They Live]]

B0027BJC7M|5.0|A book in perfect order, it came so quick, I was still wondering if I should have changed my mind.  But nope, it was very very interesting, and shifted me a little.  Thanks, Anna
0393072231|5.0|From the standpoint of the banking system and Wall Street, this book gives an excellent view of how this so-called smart money went off the rails, and how a very few investors figured it out and benefited from the folly.  Lewis explains how they researched, agonized, and withstood the battering from the \\"consensus\\" opinion leaders.....and ultimately prevailed.  A great storey, well told.  However, to understand how the politicians in washington aided and abeted this disaster you'll have to look elsewhere.  Art
031603438X|5.0|If you are interested in the Rolling Stones, rock and roll history, rock anecdotes, or an exciting auto biography, this book is for you.  It is a quick read given the subject material, and is quite interesting.  You get an inside look into the creation of the legendary Stones songs, and Keith gives an honest portrayal of his life.  I highly recommend.
B002K4MAA2|5.0|100% utterly GREAT!  This is how Romero should have been doing it when he re-started the series again with Diary of the dead - and I liked Diary, and I like Romero----but this was worth buying, hands down!  You need a region free player - but c'mon USA - read what these reviews say and some american dist. office pick this up so everyone can get it and enjoy it.
B003CN5SAY|2.0|I'm only a couple of episodes into season six, and I don't think I'll finish the series. The show has always been over the top, but you always cared about the characters. They have now become unlikeable, it's like enough already. That being said, I did enjoy seasons 1-5, the series just stayed around one season to many.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This series, along with the movie Serenity is simply amazing. Highly recommend to anybody who enjoys Science Fiction, or great stories.
B003EY7IUY|2.0|I find the shopaholic series to be mindless reading, something to pass the time and entertaining for the most part.  Everything Becky does, you take with a grain of salt, and just enjoy the ride.  With this book however, her wacky spending and crazy antics just seemed inappropriate given the economical climate but mostly the direct result it has on her child.  I couldn't enjoy this book anywhere near as much as I did the others.  Additionally, I read this on the kindle, so I didn't realize I was at the end of the book until I got to the acknowledgements page.  I was thinking I was missing a chapter, it was left so open.
0810979772|5.0|I was very impressed with the short wait time to get this item.  I ordered it on a Thursday, and received it the very next Monday.  The book is also in perfect condition.  Great Service!!
B003EYVXTG|4.0|Deep in the backwoods of Missouri, 17-year old Ree Dolly has a hard life; she's raising her siblings, caring for her mentally-ill mother, and running the house all by herself.  Her father, a meth cooker, has jumped bail and the family will lose their home if he can't be brought in to the law so Ree must go to all of her kinfolk for help, even though she knows their code of silence is enforced by beatings - and worse.<br /><br />This low-budget film is excellent, reminiscent of \\"Coal Miner's Daughter\\" without the music and happy ending.  The harsh and utterly hopeless lives of the mountain poor are presented unflinchingly; I never felt anyone was acting.  Many of the smaller roles are, in fact, played by non-professional locals and they are all convincing.  Ree's courage in seeking out her father amid her brutal relatives is admirable and frightening.<br /><br />The top-notch script, direction, and acting make for a scary, depressing, but always riveting movie, a glimpse into a rarely-seen world.  Recommended.
B00275EHJG|4.0|I have 4 kids from 12-3, they all love toy story, and I think this movie is great, but Lotso and Big baby scares my 3 year old. Even though he ( my 3 year old) has every toy from toy story he runs when the other kids want to watch Toy Story 3. He watches 1 & 2 all day but not Toy Story 3
0823003035|5.0|This is a great book for figure drawing.  Be warned this book mostly focuses on long drawings and rendering and doesn't go into gesture or quick drawing much.  The process he outlines and teaches is mostly for drawings that you intend to spend hours on.  There are definitely things that everyone can take from this book.
B004FDPOHC|4.0|Fans of Daft Punk are going to find this an interesting turn for the every evolving French duo. Still containing their specific flavor of musical style, this soundtrack is a mature and beautifully thematic venture into the world of Film Scores. Beautiful, haunting and driven, this is a fantastic Album and and I can't believe Amazon is selling it for $3.99!!!!  Other than the one single, it's not a dance album - but I'm glad for that. I love a good motion picture sound track and this one delivers.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I don't want to ruin this movie for anyone. If you have not seen this version of A Christmas Carol, purchase it now! The visual imagery is spectacular! Be forewarned, I personally do not think this version is appropriate for children as it is very heavy, dark and a bit scary. Overall, I think it captures the spirit of Dickens' original work, leaving nothing out. Some may say Robert Zemeckis took too much artistic liberty with Dickens work but I staunchly disagree. The ghosts held up the mirror squarely to Scrooge's face and he had to accept his failures and the very possible consequences of continuing down the path he was currently on. the bestpart of it all though is the fact that much of Dickens' original dialogue from the books are spoken through out the movie. Kudos Jim Cary and Mr. Zemeckis!
B0043J08C4|4.0|This film really picks up speed towards the end, which was nice. But I like an entire movie, not just the last half of one. Whereas Predator started immediately, and you understand from the getgo what is going on, in Predators, I seriously did not understand anything until I was half-way through the film.    [--> Spoilers:  Basically, you have a bunch of people who are dropped by parachute onto the Predator's home planet. All of these people were the really bad people back here on planet Earth, so they have a will to survive. After a walk that was a lot longer than it needed to be, and a monster fight that was way too long, they finally came to the edge of a cliff and realized they were not on Earth.     From this point, things picked up speed. We had a very interesting walk through the Predators camp, a breathtaking series of fights, and the final culmination of the film in an attempted murder, and a final scene in which more parachutes are seen dropping and Adrien Brody and Alice Braga walk off triumphantly. Spoilers End <--]    Overall, we had a good film overall, certainly an A-movie after the lousy AvP films. This, to a certain extent, lived up to the reputation of Schwarzenegger's early film. But it just didn't do it for me.     This film had some character development, but not as much as I'd been hoping for. I kept wondering why there was a woman in the group: was she going to fall in love with someone? She certainly was not the female-star like in the Resident Evil 1 film. Some of the characters seemed a little shallow.    --------------    Summary: overall, I recommend this film. This has breathtaking vistas and the visual effects are great. For 'Predator' fans, you might be a little disappointed, but overall, I think you'll enjoy it. I recommend it.

B004259BMM|5.0|Keith Urban's Get closer brings us another album of country rocking, toe-tapping, riveting music.  From his first song \\"Put you in a song\\" and \\"Long Hot Summer\\" Keith has you singing out loud in the car (while you think no one is watching) and the tunes are so catchy, you can find yourself humming them here and there throughout the day.  His guitar licking chops are most evident in \\"Georgia Woods) with a phenomenal guitar solo near the end that I can hardly wait to see in concert.  \\"You gonna fly\\" is an upbeat song with no-holds barred lyrics. Keith's more sensitive side is most evident in his \\"All for you\\" and \\"Get closer to you\\", a tribute, I'm certain, to his wife Nicole.  \\"Turn out the Lights\\" is a nice mid-tempo song with some really good advice on what could be one scenario in conflict management.   And my advice...  Good solid lyrics, great guitar playing, edgy and yet soft, all at once.  Another great album to add to your collection.
0316154687|2.0|I've loved Sedaris' essays in the past. His ability to mix the poignant and hilarious in a brilliantly unique voice has always captivated me.<br /><br />But with this book, while the well-honed voice is still there, the depth and rawness (the heart?) were gone. It was as if he had run out of things to say, but couldn't stop talking.<br /><br />One of his best tools has always been the lacerating way that he writes about those around him, and in the process reveals more about himself than his subjects. But I found myself wondering if perhaps he had hurt too many loved-ones with his previous books, and was trying to minimize the damage to his personal life this time around.<br /><br />Attempting to find replacement material, he tries to write bitingly about people like taxi drivers and airplane passengers, but the contact is too brief to result in anything but roughed out charactures.<br /><br />These essays come across as a set of cocktail-hour anecdotes. Well-polished anecdotes.
0230749615|5.0|Great follow-up to \\"The Gruffalo\\". It's a wonderful story and the rhyming is great. Great for toddlers as well as pre-schoolers.
B004856SQ8|5.0|The creators of the A-Team TV show were also the producers of this movie, so you have a rare affection for the original, and it shows throughout. From the second scene in the movie on, if you're paying attention you'll split your sides laughing ... and at lines and situations meant to be laughed at.<br /><br />Very importantly, these four guys get it right. Its always hard to live up to well loved TV characters, but this pulled it off. It didn't take long before I was seeing them as the A-Team, and not letting my eyes play tricks in subbing in the faces of the original cast. LOL<br /><br />This film put me in mind of the TV show, but bigger ... which is exactly what a film adaptation of a TV series should do. One big difference ... this A-Team won't shoot at you endlessly without a hit. They kill plenty of bad guys. Action scenes are interesting, which is hard to do these days when so many films with wild action scenes have come before.<br /><br />This film goes back to document the incident that makes the A-Team victims of an unfair court martial, and then fugitives. I enjoyed that segment of the movie, and applaud the creators for setting up the rest of the movie with that story.<br /><br />Viewing tip: We watched this with the sub-titles on, and that turned out to work well. There are many lines that are background asides, or delivered during action sequences and are hard to hear, but contribute to the comedic elements of the film. I guarantee we would have missed a considerable amount of that dialog without the sub-titles on.
B003VPC72K|5.0|I'm a fan of the Deftones, but above that, I'm a fan of MUSIC. This is without doubt in my top ten albums of the decade - and to own in in vinyl it's a whole different animal. I have a decent stereo, and to listen to it from the vinyl gives it another perspective. I do not own the first pressing - so I can't tell whether it's better or worse, but soundwise, it is FLAWLESS. Buy this.
044654759X|5.0|I have read all of Nicholas Sparks' books and enjoy them all, but this one is up there on my \\"favorite\\" list. It has his usual setting of North Carolina and the typical romance that we've all come to love about his books, but this one also has that \\"danger\\" element and a great message to those who find themselves in an abusive relationship. I love a little suspense with my romantic novel. It was hard to put down. I was up half the night reading until I finished it. For any Nicholas Sparks fan this is a must read.

B0009MAO46|5.0|This is Disney/Pixar's first computer made movie. And is one of the best ever. This movie is awesome, love the characters and the story.
6305531412|5.0|I love this movie,it's not fun for the whole family type movie but it's more of an adult oriented one and that's good too. Roger Rabbit- Pl Pl Pleeeeease! I love it, and Christoper Lloyd? It can't get better than that. Silly and Fun.
B001AQT11M|1.0|First of all, great movie:  much anticipated by family  But:  it does not play in DVD players, computer DVD drives (this is the regular not the blu-ray version).  It almost appears to have a \\"ridge\\" around the outside of the disc.  Apparently I'm not the only one with the problem; I'm planning to return it to Amazon and hope that a second one will be better....
1439107955|5.0|This author is so in the know, it's a delight to absorb all that he has to offer. Written in easy to understand writing, I tore through this book at a breakneck pace, which is unusual for me as I usually take MONTHS to read a book.   Sidd offers such interesting insight. I felt very confident in his knowledge. A must read if you need info on cancer.  Thank u SIDD!
B0011NVC9I|1.0|Awful, just awful. Beowulf with a Cockney accent. CGI-encrusted actors who look like they stepped from the unrated director's cut of \\"Shrek.\\" A script (co-written by a respected fantasy author) that follows the lead of many other adaptations by establishing an unconvincing \\"personal connection\\" between Hrothgar and the monsters. A battle in which strategically placed benches, mead cups, and beams cover the naked warrior's wedding tackle -- Austin Powers as Beowulf? The nadir of Robert Zemeckis' fixation on motion-capture animation.

B003IDEX04|5.0|I adore [[ASIN:B003IDEX04 Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl (Mass Market Paperback)]] and have read it multiple times over the years. Anne's diary has come to mean different things to me as I've grown older - when I first read it as a ten-year-old girl, I was fascinated by the hidden life she led with her family and there was a sense of dread and excitement about her precarious circumstances, the danger of being discovered. When I read Anne's diary again as a teenager, I came to empathize with Anne's frustrations with her mother and the other adults around her whom Anne felt did not understand her and treated her as a child. I felt Anne's desire to be 'heard' and not just treated as an inconvenience or child was so much aligned with what I was going through during adolescence.<br /><br />When I re-read the diary as an adult, I came to appreciate all the other things - the tragedy of having lost such an amazing and talented young voice in the most horrible of circumstances; the beauty of Anne's writing which is all the more amazing given how young she was when she wrote this diary; and the themes of alienation, fear, and hope. Now, as the mother of a young daughter, I read this diary again and gain another fresh perspective - of the complex relationship between daughter and mother. Anne had a strained relationship with her mother Edith, and clearly gravitated toward her beloved Pim (father). This was obvious even before Anne and her family were compelled to move into hiding in the Annex. As a mother, reading Anne's thoughts about her mother (often unflattering) was a disconcerting experience, though things do improve somewhat later on.<br /><br />Anne Frank's Diary of a Young Girl is a classic not only of Holocaust literature, but also a classic Young Adult read with its myriad themes that will appeal to both adolescents and adult readers.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Glad I finally bought the first season. I remember when my brother first brought it home...I was iffy on whether or not I would like this show. BOY, WAS I HOOKED. Every episode leaves you wanting more....so nice to have it on DVD so you can have more whenever you want....that is until the next season :)
006097625X|5.0|Recognizing that my 10 year-old son was in love with comic books, but didn't really understand them, I bought this book for him.<br /><br />The easy-to-read comic book format uses humor and demonstration to teach technique.  Scott McCloud very capably shows just what makes comics funny, how to use frames, spaces, color, motion, lines, and more.  It's also an easy and funny read just by itself (which is why I bought it for him).<br /><br />It is now one of his favorites.  And I have to admit to enjoying it myself.
B003HARV3Y|1.0|This movies is awful, the only reason I gave it a star is because I have to.  The only thing they got right from the book was the name of the characters.  I very much enjoyed the book, and have read the entire series, but this movie was an epic Failure.  Look I know that books do not translate well into movies, so to expect it to be perfectly and follow it exactly is rather unfair, however this was nothing like the book and followed nothing at all.  I have enjoyed movies where they changed the story like Harry Potter, X-Men trilogy, and Star Trek.  I am not a Book -> Movie Nazi, but this movies was not even mildly entertaining.  Had it been a good movie with good acting I would have been forgiving of the fact that it did not follow the book.  But it was slow and boring and completely wrong.  I wish I could have these two hours of my life back.  Next time leave the movie in the Underworld with Hades.  What was wrong  No mention of the prophecy, wtf is this law about gods not being able to interact with their Children, children of the big three are rare?!?!? they didnt even mention that the big three had a pact not to have kids with mortals, left Grover in the underworld, no mention of the quest instead Percy just decided to leave, no interaction with Ares, had them run all over the US for pearls which were actually given to Percy in the book, Annabeth should be blonde, Ms Dodds should be the math teacher not a sub english teacher, no mention of the fates, so many more things missing... and it was utterly boring!!!!
0375842209|1.0|This book was my book club's choice for our November meeting and it seemed that less than half of the members liked it or even wanted to discuss it. I got my copy late and when I started reading it, I just couldn't get into the book. With all the terrible things going on in the world, I don't feel a need to read a book about WW II told from the standpoint of Death. I got through the first few pages and just thought \\"oh, no, I don't need this!\\" so stopped reading it. A few in my book club liked it and thought that the use of color to describe the mood of various interactions in the book was well done. Me-- I just couldn't get past all the death and devastation. My family lived it in Europe, I've heard stories about it, and I have been to many WW II battlefields in Europe. This book just casts a dark shadow on my soul.
B004259BMM|5.0|I really love this entire CD collection of music.  Musically and lyrically it is so wonderful.  It touches my heart and the music fills me with a feeling of being taken to another place.  My favorite thing to do is listen to it with the head phones on at night and just let the music take me away.  I find Keith's vocals to be exquisite on this Cd.  Crystal clear and so heartfelt.  His guitar work is superior and I find this entire collection of music to be one of his best works so far.  I am a big fan and I would love to encourage others to buy and listen to this CD.  You won't regret it.  it is truly magical!
B004EI3ON4|4.0|While many are expecting a fully new Daft Punk album with a large amount being new strictly electronic songs, don't be disappointed when you find that that is not the case.  As it is not a bad soundtrack, it is not what many are expecting.  The heavy advertisement of \\"Derezzed\\" may make most people think this is strictly going to be a majority of songs like it, when it's not.  Daft Punk creates it all, although most of it being more orchestra based with hints of their electronic sound.  This is what it is... a Motion Picture Soundtrack.  Having said that, it's a great one.  Well worth the $4 deal, but don't expect it to be a fully electronic Daft Punk album.
0446679089|4.0|One of the better books that I have read by this author.  Kept my interest to the end and didn't drag on and on like some do.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Nelson DeMille!
B002QBS9KE|3.0|The product works, it fits in your ear properly and you can hear the person that you're talking to loud and clear. What I'm questioning about this product though, is it's durability. These earpieces just don't seem to last no more than 6 months of use. I'm not even abusing them or anything, the glue or whatever that holds the rubber to the plastic just always rips apart and it's frustrating having to spend another $5 just to continue using my $100 Bluetooth headset. It's like an annual subscription fee or something. There's a reason why I laid down the extra cash for this headset rather than going with some $50 headset that would (with some comfort issues possibly) work just as well.
B00454U1NS|5.0|...and I'm not exactly sure why. Hard rock sure isn't 'my style', but I've found Pink refreshing. I said before that she may be a \\"21st. century Carly Simon\\" complete with problems, heart-on-sleeve, and confessional songs, and I stand by that. She's pretty, in a hard-edged sort of way, and she has a strong, clear, understandable voice. Yes, the \\"understandable\\" part can be a problem, as the Explicit Lyrics warning means what it says, but kids are going to learn those words all too soon anyway.<br /><br />The present offering is a well chosen collection of numbers from her earlier CDs, with two bonus tracks. The problems are evident, complete with drugs (\\"Just Like a Pill\\"), broken family dynamics (\\"Family Portrait\\", \\"So What\\"), and confused identity (\\"Stupid Girls\\"). The producers gave us \\"Glitter in the Air\\", and I'm glad they did as it's a masterpiece. The two bonus cuts are quite good. I could have done without the political bilge of \\"Dear Mr. President\\", but it is a well done song.<br /><br />All-in-all, this is a most excellent collection. If you're a fan, you already have it. If not you may just want to see what you've missed. If you don't like her, that's OK, but I bet you will...
B00447G29S|4.0|This is a review for The Polar Express 3D version, only. I won't try to say anything more about the movie than you all ready know, but I'll opine this: for over $30, the value is NOT there. There is NOTHING with this bluray. At all. It's the disc in a blue box. That's it. No literature, nothing. I feel totally ripped off. The fact that the bluray was that much to begin with is bad enough. I know, I know, some people will tout BD Live, others will say it's a movie, not a book, but when I pay this much for something, I expect there to be some value in it. C'est la vie.
0375847227|5.0|I first read this series in high school and six years later I'm still feeling its impact. Honestly, few books have such a powerful place in my heart. The plot is absolutely riveting throughout all three books! Even when I reread them, I plow through them at breakneck speed because I'm so tense about what is to come. I could go on and on about the high fantasy and adventure of it all- the witches, the ice bears, the evil organizations, the sea-faring gyptians, the aeronauts, the battles, the jumping between worlds, the terrible North, the fantastic creatures, the narrow escapes...the list goes on.     But as exciting as all that is- and it is UNBELIEVABLY so- the strength of the characters and their emotional journeys is really what connects me to it. Lyra is one of the most well realized protagonists ever written. Even though she's only half my age, she is a constant source of strength and inspiration for me. While these books would be thoroughly enjoyable for any person, of any age (12+) or gender, I especially recommend them to adolescent girls. The way society is today, wit all the pressures that young women face, there is an ever pressing need for strong, female role models and Lyra fits the bill 100%. She's comparable to Hermione of the more popular Harry Potter series- but she brings a different kind of strength to the table. Instead of being a hero's sidekick, this is HER story which makes her even more powerful of a heroine.     She is truly one of the fiercest, cheekiest, bravest, cleverest, most compassionate, most PASSIONATE and most incredible female characters ever created. She's a real person, who is sometimes rude and sometimes impulsive and rash but is always driven by a genuine desire to do the right thing at all costs. She has a strength that scarcely seems possible for an eleven year old girl, but Pullman writes her in a way that is 100% believable.     Watching her exciting, trying, sometimes heartbreaking journey from an innocent child who lovesrunning wild in her Oxford home, wreaking havoc and stirring up mischief around every corner, into a wise young woman who has known life, death, love and tragedy is an experience I can't even properly express in words, though I wish I could. She grows so much, experiences so much and finds so much strength within herself. It is truly one of the most beautiful fictional journeys ever written.    Aside from Lyra, there are an array of other fascinating characters. I've been rambling on for far too long to really get into it, but this story is filled to the brim with complex, fascinating, multi-layered characters. Mrs. Coulter, for example- you're left guessing about her right until the very end.     These books take place in fantastical worlds with creatures and events that would never happen in our own, but they have an extraordinary ability to instill strength, bravery and self-belief in readers and I cannot possibly give them higher praise.
031603438X|5.0|Keith pulls no punches in \\"Life\\"; it amazes me that he remembers as much as he did to even write this book, which chronicles his early life & his time with the Rolling Stones. At over 500 pages it's still an easy read & you'll get a better idea about the inner workings of Keith's life and career. Highly recommended!
B002N5N4M6|4.0|This is one of the best written series to come around in years. The whole cast rocks and this 3rd season DVD is a GEM! If you are a fan of this series, you need to pick this up. This was great deal as well.

B003Y5HWJU|5.0|Boardwalk Empire is a great show, the 21st century version of a 19th century novel. It's Dickens, Dostoevsky, Tolstoi. The relationship between Nucky and Margaret is like nothing else on TV. Buscemi was absolutely terrific in the finale. The exploration of criminal culture, and its relationship to political culture, is pretty fascinating. I cannot wait for next season!
B002NZK5RI|4.0|Copycat is one of the many psychological horror movies to attempt following the path of The Silence of the Lambs- where the protagonists attempt to get into the mind of a criminal in order to stop them.<br /><br />The protagonists of Copycat are Dr. Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver) and detective M.J. Monahan (Holly Hunter).  An expert on serial killers, who after an attempted murder has confined herself to her home, Hudson realizes a killer whose been terrorizing San Francisco is imitating previous killers.  The eventual team-up between the two leads to a thrilling climax.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver really is the driving force behind Copycat.  Only Weaver could play a paranoid woman who retains a snarky, incredibly aggressive personality with such believable grace.  As for the film itself, if you've seen one cat-and-mouse horror movie you've seen them all and Copycat offers little innovation as far as plot is concerned.  Holly Hunter's character is forgettable, William McNamara is a dime-a-dozen \\"intelligent sociopath\\" and to top it off Herry Connick, Jr. as Daryll Lee Cullum (the one who previously attempted to murder Weaver's character) is quite clearly a cheap Hannibal knock-off.<br /><br />Despite its flaws Copycat is a well-made thriller that will keep it audience entertained.  Could it have been better?  Yes, but as it is the film is worth watching if only for Sigourney Weaver's performance.

0393068382|5.0|Although women can now vote, access higher education and pursue traditionally \\"male\\" careers, a number of books and scientific studies have been published to demonstrate or prove that there is a \\"hard-wired\\" difference between male and female brains.  Coincidentally, these differences explain the traditional, gendered approaches that we've used in child-rearing, education and professional mentoring in many parts of the world.  If you're not aware of what those are, they work to encourage females to pursue vocations (or sometimes just avocations) that focus on nurturing or the home and males to pursue scientific, mathematic or adventurous endeavors.  Such works have been used to justify why it is that although women are legally allowed to pursue competitive careers, the emotional and logistical needs of the home still need to be addressed by women.  This also explain that girls are biologically programmed to play in ways that reflect a nurturing tendency and why boys can't help sometimes being more physically agressive and even destructive.<br /><br />Much has been made already of Dr. Fine's analysis of the studies and the extrapolations used to justify their conclusions.  She also points out that the gold-standard technology used in these studies, the PET and fMRI scans, are not as well-developed as some would have you believe.  Many neuroscientists are skeptical about how much they prove about brain activity and how much can be extrapolated about behavior from said activity.  Further, even if it can be shown that different sized brains (the average male brain is larger than the average female brain) light up differently during a certain behavior, many scientists believe that the different brains are working differently so that they can accomplish the same task.  In other words, even if male and female brains are different, that doesn't mean that they must behave differently.  It should also be noted that doctors cannot look at a brain scan and identify whether the brain they are looking at is male or female without being told first; they're not *that* different, and although the average size of the male brain is larger, there is still overlap.<br /><br />We are reminded throughout the book that neuroscience is just the latest in the arsenal of scientists to justify \\"normal\\" social behaviors.  The measurement of skull size, \\"snout length\\", the size of the cervical and lumbar vertebrae and, my favorite, the energy usage of the ovaries at the expense of the brain were all used in the nineteenth and even twentieth centuries to discourage women from pursuing careers as doctors or scientists or even voting.  To modern ears, those all sound ridiculous.  And yet, today, many will grab onto the most tenuous connections between supposed brain activity and observed behavior and make extrapolations about what must be genetically programmed.<br /><br />But this is not Fine's larger point.  Purveyors and consumers of popular science seem to rely on the assumption that your genetic \\"programming\\" is what will ultimately dictate your behavior and the environment you and others like you shape.  As Fine (and many others) have pointed out, the causation can go both ways.  Gene expression is also dependent on stimulus from the environment.  More importantly, it is also affected by your thoughts.  As she puts it, the skull is not nearly as impermeable to social influences as we like to think.<br /><br />Fine does not discount that there may indeed be differences that are dependent on gender (personally, I prefer the term sex).  Her intent here is to hold under heightened scrutiny what has been previously accepted in other pop-science.  What we find by the end of the book is that much of what we \\"know\\", including the gospel of Greater Male Variability, are not scientific facts but sociological phenomena.<br /><br />In the 90s, Susan Faludi's [[ASIN:0307345424 Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women]] systematically broke down the assumptions about women's status and potential by examining hard data and statistics.  Fine is as systematic but, it must be admitted, much more sarcastic.  When, however, she describes the breathtaking lack of good scientific practice and simple professionalism scientists have used to justify continued social biases and inequalities, it's hard not to nod in agreement.by examining hard data and statistics.  Fine is as systematic but, it must be admitted, much more sarcastic.

B002ZG99A4|2.0|I was very excited when I first heard about this movie, I am a huge action buff and was giddy about seeing all these great action legends together. The action scenes were really good and really well done, the reason I gave it two stars was because the dialogue between the actors was HORRIBLE, and I mean bad, so bad that my girlfriend and I kept looking at each other in disbelief that this movie was so highly rated, usually in action movies I can easily overlook acting and dialogue, because the action is what everyone wants to see, but not in this case...it was painful to sit through, especially Dolph Lungren, apparantly he is much better in roles where he doesn't speak...at all... the lines were really ridiculous, hey theirs no doubt that Stallone can make action movies, no doubt, but i'm thinking he needs someone else to write the dialogue with his scripts, because this could have been one of the greatest action movies ever made....but it's not, by a longshot
B003ITZBVI|5.0|This animation movie was one of the best for Batman in a long time. Nice theme of movie to bring back Robin II from the Dead. The story keeps in good character and follows the comics story line very well too. I would recommend this for any Batman fan.
0525423273|5.0|Seventeen-year-old Anna couldn't be more equipped for her senior year. She has Bridge, her fun and quirky best friend, Toph, her co-worker and new love interest, and the perfect starter job for a film buff at the local movie theater.  But in an attempt to show he has some class to go with his bestselling sappy author status Anna's father has announced that she will be moving to Paris to attend SOAP (The School of America in Paris) instead. Although she misses home, Anna's lucky enough to fall into an awesome group of friends, which includes insta-crush Etienne St. Clair, the American born, half-French, British-raised hottie of the school, who just so happens to have a long-time girlfriend. As Anna and Etienne quickly become friends over the course of a year full of romantic misunderstandings and misassumptions, Anna tries not to think that her wishes might come true. But in the City of Light, anything could happen.    With its oo la la European/romantic premise, hyped state in the blogosphere, and my cautious (okay, more like wussy) nature I was understandably a little hesitant to pick Anna and the French Kiss up. As the positive reviews started to fill my reader however, I let myself believe, just a little bit, that it could be all it was pimped out to be. So even though come release day I was feeling a little slumpy reading-wise, I went for it when a copy was so thoughtfully sent my way, and there was no looking back.    It was not only the enchantingly authentic Paris that had me from the first page but the pitch-perfect voice of Anna. She's sarcastic, brutally honest, and full of the angsty teenage insecurities that everyone's been through. I enjoyed being in her overanalytic, unsure mind. The back book blurb by YA author Justina Chen Headley is spot on: \\"but-does-he-like-me?!\\" was perfectly captured in this book. I found this whole approach completely refreshing amongst the many love or lust-at-first-sight YA romances. It was a fun ride to see Anna and Etiennegrow from acquaintances to best friends and potential lovers. I love a slow buildup with plenty of witty conversation, chance encounters, and just plain ole hanging out, and this had it all. I could say a lot more but I won't because it's hard to do this book justice, and many others have already said it better.    An incredibly sweet story, smile-inducing humor, an endearing protagonist, and the perfect charming and stylish nice guy? You can't ask for much more. Let's just say I'll be there in a year for the first companion book to Anna and the French Kiss, Lola and the Boy Next Door.

B002OSY2T6|4.0|This is a fun toy that plays music or makes noise when it is activated by baby swatting or pushing it.  The music is pleasant and not too loud and my 4 month old enjoys looking and hitting at it.  I do wish it were not so heavy or hard.  It has fallen over on my daughter a couple times and she was not able to push it off herself.  I'm sure if it were made out of a plush material, it would not be able to roll, but at this time we don't use that feature - we keep it in the locked position so it stays stationary.  This toy keeps the baby's attention for longer periods of time than her other floor toys, and I think it will continue to provide entertainment as she starts sitting and crawling.  I have been pleased with this purchase and recommend it to others.

B002JVWRAO|5.0|I happened to be home sick and caught a re-run of the show and got hooked.  In just a few episodes I felt like I caught that same dark 'X-Files' like feel and it didn't take long to see that many of the folks that worked on Supernatural had X-Files background.  The series is going to be too scary for most pre-teens and there are sex scenes that also make it unappropriate for the younger crowd.  But,...I'm an old guy and I love the show.  If you like monstor movies where the story begins and ends within that single episode, this is a good show for you.
B001UV4XFQ|2.0|I don't usually do written  reviews,  but this time I have to say that I'm EXTREMELY disappointed on how this version of the so called blu ray and Dvd combo was packaged.  Using only one dics to have both  the blu ray and Dvd version? HUH? I could have saved myself money and just bought the Blu ray only if I only wanted one disc.  I like fact that every    blu ray/ dvd  combo I have bought  have had  two discs separately.  One for my blu ray player and one for my dvd player.   It was a shock to get this one with  both formats on one disc.   I think for the price they should have done two or at least make it clearer that it was only going to be one disc which to me is a dumb thing  to do. Back when I preordered this item I don't recall it being advertised as a Single-Disc, as it is now.   It may be cheaper  for them but not for me.  I will not be buying any more combos done this way.  I have learn my lesson.  Save yourself some money and avoid them too.  Either buy only the blu ray or the DVD since you will only get one disc with the combos, and save yourself some bucks.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|Great lens for the money. If you want highly detailed macro shots, this is the lens for the job. I would suggest purchasing a tripod as even the slightest movement will add noise and blur to the photos.

B001JFZ118|5.0|HIGHLANDER (1986) is one of my personal favorite flicks! Don't care that it's not really a FILM. But it's definitely a MOVIE experience! Trapped (for better or worse) in the 80s, HIGHLANDER is one of the very few movies that I've ever seen that has an absolutely outlandish premise, but pulls it off with total confidence, competence, and flair! The movie pulls you in from the start, with a rocking song by music group Queen (which supplied all the songs for the movie) and introduces us to the title character Connor MacLeod, the Highlander, played with strong conviction by Frenchman Christopher Lambert. The opening swordfight sequence between MacLeod and his first foe Fasil in the Madison Square Garden garage is a cool, fast-paced scene. Then the movie flashes back to 16th century Scotland where we find that MacLeod is actually immortal and the only way he can die is by beheading.<br /><br />Flashback scenes show that in the 16th century, MacLeod was trained by another immortal, the flamboyant Spaniard Ramirez (played with scene-stealing flair by the legendary Sean Connery). The mentorship scenes between MacLeod and Ramirez have a sweep and grandeur that is rarely portrayed in films anymore, at least not in such a heartfelt, unassuming way. MacLeod also outlives his first wife Heather (sexy, sweet Beatie Edney). In flashback, we are also introduced to the evil immortal Kurgan (played by Clancy Brown in brilliantly unapologetic, energetic performance), who is out to be the last immortal to win The Prize.<br /><br />In the present day, MacLeod meets police forensics expert Brenda (fiery and luscious Roxanne Hart), whose avocation is studying and writing books on ancient swords. She's interested in MacLeod's sword, which she found remnants of in the Garden lot while the police were investigating the aftermath of the MacLeod-Fasil fight. MacLeod and Brenda develop a strong attraction to each other and Brenda's investigation leads her to find out of MacLeod's immortality and she falls in love with him. Meanwhile, Kurgan seeks out Macleod in present-day New York to battle for The Prize.<br /><br />The movie's star Lambert does a great job of conveying MacLeod's eternal dread of living a life of loneliness; he is detached and melancholy, but still resilient, forthright and strong. Which makes the ending all the more satisfying. Another big selling point of HIGHLANDER is it's on-location cinematography (the luscious Scottish highlands countered with the gritty New York atmosphere and locales), giving the fantasy a realistic appeal. This, interspersed with the fantastic Queen music and fast-paced, no-nonsense, yet involving storytelling makes HIGHLANDER an 80s keeper!<br /><br />****WARNING/SPOILERS****I will add a minor comment about the director's cut, which includes 2 scenes that I'm glad got left out of the original presentation: 1 is scene of Connor and the British girl he found during WWII (who would grow up to be his assistant in the antique shop) and 1 of Connor and Brenda at the zoo in the aftermath of their love scene****END OF WARNING/SPOILERS****

B000O599XK|5.0|so many movies today struggle with the male bonding between 2 main characters and yet 4 completely different male leads in Rio Bravo make the buddy stuff natural, seamless, and hilarious.  I adore John Wayne's gruff, strong, brooding character, which he has patented like no other (Mel Gibson has to play psychotic to achieve even a whisper of what John Wayne embodies), but in this movie, Wayne smiles, a lot!!   It is very apparent that the entire cast enjoyed themselves immensely and although I wish I could have been somewhere in that jail myself, I will take second best, which is to watch this movie again and again.  As so many have already written, Walter Brennen easily steals every scene (even when he's away from the camera lens and it is just his voice).  That man has to be one of the greatest actors that has ever lived and if I could have only one example of his acting talent, this movie would be my choice.  He out-gruffs John Wayne at every turn and it is male-magic.  The duet between Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson could have been one of the cheesiest moments in movie history and yet it was pure inspiration.  The culminating of those two voices, was for me, a true high point of the movie, nicely underplayed to seem so natural, and Walter Brennen's school-boy enthusiasm to join in was another inspired moment.  And Wayne's facial expression; 'get out the back door' - Wayne also knew he was experiencing something rare -  FUN, FUN, FUN.  A John Wayne movie usually features one 'no-body' actor, that Wayne likes to give a career boost to and I would say it was Ricky Nelson (since Dean did have some experience).  Fortunately, Nelson excelled in this role as a naive-looking pretty boy that would have been laughed out of the west, except for one remarkable talent - which was possibly being the fastest gun in the west, combined with cool level-headed thinking (I would guess it was a tip-of-the hat to the main character in 'Shane', as both these men shared a similar physique: small, pretty, and not intimidating). Out of all the novice actors 'given a chance' by Wayne, Ricky is my surprise favorite.  My pick for worst would have been the 'whiny-voiced rhinestone cowboy' in True Grit. The combination of these actors/musicians and what they individually brought to this movie, including Angie Dickinson is engaging to say the least.  The very worst I can say about this movie is that Dean Martin (who I adore musically/comedic) really had a lot of tough moments to act out here and although he didn't excel, I would definitely give him a passing grade. This kind of ease of characters bonding naturally, bringing together drama, flair, and humor was in one other John Wayne movie too (that I highly recommend):  HATARI!!
B002ZG980U|1.0|While I love this movie and was eagerly awaiting its release, I have to admit that I am quite upset with the movie studio.    When ordering the DVD, it was listed as having four featurettes as special features.  what the description fails to tell you is that each one of these is only about 2-3 minutes long.  I do not think that I should be penalized for not buying a blu-ray player and paying higher prices for blu-ray discs.     I was really looking forward to learning more about the film but now I find myself upset and writing a rare review.  don't get me wrong, I love the film and wish there were more like it. I just wish that I didn't feel cheated

B002ZG981E|2.0|Mr. Nolan seems to like puzzles. A lot.  Just take a look at The Following or Momento.    With Inception, I think he tried to create the mother of all puzzles. Dreams within dreams within dreams and yes, within dreams.  My complaint is, who dreams like this?  If Leo and his crew joined my slumbers, they could share with me a race to a job I don't even have, an odd chat with my deceased aunt, a hike in the woods that transforms itself into a hotel lobby and of course, being naked when you don't want to be.  All in no special order.    Mr. Nolan's dream worlds are more like parallel realities, each with a very crisp narrative and very specific physical environment (and populated by armies of unnecessary bad guys.)  They aren't dreamy.  They're Matrixy.    Watching Inception is like watching Mission Impossible, three James Bond movies, and What Dreams May Come all at the same time.  It's exhausting.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Movie is excellent, with outstanding performances from DiCaprio, Caine, and the rest, but I have a comment to make on the price policy.    I agree with uugh's comment. See his view elsewhere on this site. I tried to get a refund for the difference (12-7-2010), but Amazon said that 'We offer low prices but don't price match with other retailers nor do we have bulk order discounts.' Anyone can search Amazon's website for their policy on price matching.    I won't pre order any new movies from Amazon again.

However, I still won't get any new movies from Amazon anymore.
0553805371|1.0|I purchased this book after watching the interview of Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow   on Larry King Live. Their knowledge came across in the interview, and was emphasized by Mr.  Mlodinow, as being for the lay person's enlightenment. I did not expect this book to be an   easy read, but I also didn't expect it to be for those versed in the math and sciences.   Even the jacket of the book states that the most recent scientific thinking about the   mysteries of the universe, is presented in \\"nontechnical language marked by brilliance and  simplicity.\\" Although I appreciated the examples meant to clarify each theory, I was left  more confused than ever, and with the same questions that they purported to answer with   this book.

I always wondered why the world would go to war because some Austrian archduke was murdered. Now I know. The story is humanized by having characters in each of the main countries (England, Germany, France, Russia and the Unites States) react to the situations created by the war.

0312370849|3.0|I read this book on a recommendation from a friend.<br /><br />Set in both 1942 and 2002 with the link being the round of Parisian Jews to V&eacute;l d'Hiv, there was a wonderfully rich and previously unknown-to-me backdrop to the stories of Sarah and Julia.<br /><br />I found this to be a fairly fast paced read that was satisfying, though full of 'convenient' turns of events and conclusions.<br /><br />I always have mixed feelings about fiction pieces that function as almost-memoirs but aren't.<br /><br />However, I did appreciate learning about this event and the details included in the book made the read all that more engaging, particularly in the early parts when there was a shared perspective with young Sarah.<br /><br />I found the personal story of Julia (the main narrator) to be a tad contrived and meandering at times as she waxes and wanes between her American roots and her Parisian reality. I never did see the deeper connection I hoped this character would make with the story she becomes inexorably tied too...with the exception of the final lines of the book. That, by the way, bordered on annoying.<br /><br />I did think this tale was a somewhat veiled pro-life pitch, BUT I admit I may be reading into this book's unspoken parallels between the Holocaust and Julia's personal predicament.<br /><br />All told, I did like the book and would recommend it to others, but not so much for the characters as their stories.

This is my second book on North Korea that I've read, and this one particularly struck me because of its humanness. I DEFINITELY recommend this book. Please read it; it will affect your outlook on life.     The first book I read was [[ASIN:0349118655 This is Paradise!: My North Korean Childhood]] by Hyok Kang, and I just finished [[ASIN:0465011047 The Aquariums of Pyongyang: Ten Years in the North Korean Gulag]] by Kang Chol Hwan.

B00493AD74|1.0|This is probably the dumbest movie of the last 20 years. Julia Roberts continues her feminist movie streak with this dreadful 2 hours+ nonsense.<br /><br />The story of an intellectually underdeveloped and frustrated middle aged woman who cant cope with a husband that loves her and decides she has to be \\"free\\" to find herself, no problem with that, just ditch the husband and go booze up. Just do it in private!<br />No, she decides to to on a kitchen sink blind quest (pun intended) for the meaning of life and tries it all. pseudo Buddhism/zen (the praying concept from the title and fails horribly at it),  traveling, and overeating (the eat in the title, but through the movie magic does not actually get any fatter!) affairs galore (the love thing form the title).<br /><br />Apparently the zenith of life for the modern woman is to travel to Italy, make some local friends there and pay for these enormous meals, later travel to Bali where a quack shaman type prophesied she would get married again and try to hitch the man of her dreams. At the end she makes out with the tall dark and handsome dude. The cliches are everywhere, BUT whereas the Twilight saga for example made fun of itself by its overuse of the most generic b-movie cliches and b-movie cast, these guys actually take themselves very seriously and try to cruise by on Roberts Oscar winning past.
B004F5GKUA|4.0|Season 10 in some ways brings back some of what was lost over the last couple of seasons (so far). Smallville was getting boring and bland with forgettable episodes spaced in between the main storyline. The climax of Season 8 with Doomsday was so disappointing after a season that you were sure was going to lead to a finale that was spectacular. Zod in season 9 was a better season finale, but was an annoying character that wasn't fully realized and you found that you just didn't care.<br /><br />Now we get to season 10, the final year, and we are seeing some of the old Smallville again. Some old characters are coming back and there's so far only one episode that I found boring and a reminder of the last couple of seasons. The creators of the show know this is the last hurrah and as the season plays out you are seeing more and more of that as they go down paths that they probably wouldn't have tried in earlier seasons.<br /><br />The fight scenes still are a weak point, which is the way its always been, with only a few exceptions. Its a tv show with a limited budget so unfortunately we usually don't get to see Clark kick ass as much as we would like to.<br /><br />I'm personally happier that Chloe is out of the picture. The show seems to have improved with her character out of the way. Lois is still a great character and now that she knows about Clark that has made the story so much better. Ive always liked Green Arrow, though sometimes it feels like they want him to be a main character in the show, but they don't always know what to do with him. I like Tess Mercer far more in season 10 than I did in earlier seasons. She was very annoying early on, but has developed into something very important to the show.<br /><br />I do wish we had more interactions with other super heroes. They seem to show up infrequently here and there and nothing much seems to happen when you are really expecting some bad ass fight when you get these people together. I'm still looking forward to a big Justice League fight with as many of the good guys as they can shove into one episode<br /><br />While there has not really been anything stated, you can see season 10 leading up to the return of Lex Luthor as the final showdown.<br /><br />Season 10 is definitely better than 8 or 9, and even some of 7, but this series really needs to go out with a bang. No holding back, balls to the wall to give it the series finale it so deserves.with as many of the good guys as they can shove into one episode    While there has not really been anything stated, you can see season 10 leading up to the return of Lex Luthor as the final showdown.

B0019KWE6S|5.0|BEAUTY WILL SAVE THE WORLD..<br /><br />WHAT A BEATIFULL GOLDEN PATTERN ON THE BLACK - THIS MUSIC IS POOR BEAUTY AND TRAGEDY,, ART DIRECTOR DAVID SYLVIAN AT HIS THE BEST.<br /><br />p.s. HIGHLY RECOMENDED IF YOU WANT SOMETHING SPECIAL
B004AQR29C|4.0|Going into this movie was somewhat like going back to the 1980's with action movies like Rambo and Commando. In those movies the story didn't matter quite as much as the action, and Stallone seemed to want to bring that feeling to the modern day. For the most part I would say it worked. You know right from the beginning that this is a action movie, and if you just accept that and have fun you will mostly enjoy what you are watching.<br /><br />The cast does a good job, with Mickey Rourke's character being a surprise standout in the movie. The other sub-plots in the movie were pretty weak. I didn't really see the point of having Jason Statham's girlfriend in the movie at all.<br /><br />The action scenes are very good, but you knew that was going to be the case considering what this movie is. They also did a good job of making it look realistic and not just over the top scenes where people do the impossible the whole time.<br /><br />I know some others don't feel like the movie went into the background of the characters enough, but that didn't bother me because I knew what this movie was when I sat down to watch it. Its a throwback to action movies from 20-30 years ago and if you enjoyed those you will enjoy a more modern version here.<br /><br />I do wish that Bruce Willis and Arnold could have played a bigger role in the film, and I question how the case was chosen. This movie was promoted as joining together some old school action stars, but then there are a few sports figures in the mix. Where is Jean Claude Van Damme or Steven Segal? I may not like them much personally, but they were big with action movies in the 80's and early 90's so I think the only way this movie could have truly been improved is if the entire cast was made up of stars from action movies in the 80's and 90's.<br /><br />Overall the Expendables is a really good action movie that brings back the feeling of watching these kinds of movies when I was growing up. If you go into it looking for more than that then you may find yourself disappointed.f disappointed.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|I bought a set of these when I got my PS3 2 years ago, and loved them. Should be standard equipment, but alas its not. I recently got a new controller, so of course I need new triggers. The ones I received are NOT the ones pictured. I got the PDP triggers, but they have been slightly redesigned. These new triggers are more \\"angular\\" and stick out further both on the front (where the '2' is) and on the bottom. They also feel a little different. The originals could pass for the real, original triggers from Sony, but the new ones are obvious after market add-ons. Not even textured the same. You may want to buy these in a store so you know what you are getting. I will try to post a pic of old vs. new on Amazon soon. I even got small stress cracks on the triggers when mounting them. I ended up gluing them on like my last set, both to keep them on in fierce battle, and to keep my kid and dog from \\"losing\\" them.<br /><br />That being said, the triggers are highly effective, and are still definitely recommended. They are invaluable for racing and FPS games. If you use or used your middle fingers for R2/L2 you will wonder how you ever got along without them. Definitely the best $5 upgrade in video games since cartridge cleaning kits.(remember those?)
B004E9CFZG|4.0|I found this series by accident while I was looking online for something new to watch. My first reaction was no way, there cant be a tv series about zombies, but then you see there really is. Your next thought becomes why didn't someone do this sooner?<br /><br />Overall this is a very good series with a few small flaws on the side. AMC has shown they are one of the best when it comes to making award winning tv series and I'm sure The Walking Dead will also follow that trend.<br /><br />Where this show slips up a bit is balancing the story and people with the action and zombies. If you go into this show expecting the same as you get out of a video game or other zombie movies, you may be disappointed. On the other hand, they seem to spend a little too much time on the characters and not the action, which can make things boring at times. What makes this show good is the fact that its not just another zombie movie with endless action, but they need to find a little more of a balance.<br /><br />The characters are good all around. They are put into a impossible situation and do a great job of acting that out. I saw the wife beater, the racists, the love triangle, and on and on. They did a good job of mixing it all into the main plot and the actors do a great job with it.<br /><br />Where AMC slipped up a bit is in only having a 6 episode first season with nothing more coming till next October (unless something changes of course). I don't think anyone believed a zombie show would turn out as popular as it has, and the fans are rabid for more, which means the ten month delay is going to turn some people off.<br /><br />This is definitely a show worth watching and different from almost anything else out there.
B000OBYLVO|3.0|This is what I would loosely label as a \\"chick flick\\" - but so are many other movies that are enjoyed by both men and women. In a nutshell it's a sweet, romantic, feel good movie about being true to yourself. I was especially touched by the character interaction between Kate Winslet and Eli Wallach. Beginning the day after Thanksgiving, it's a tradition at out house to begin the rotation of our vast and diverse Christmas movie collection. I'm going to add this one because I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B004259BMM|5.0|Keith Urban's new CD \\"Get Closer\\" is an aussome CD. After all his other Cd's, Defying Gravity, Love Pain and the Whole Crazy Thing, Be Here, The Golden Road, Keith Urban, The Ranch, one wouldn't think it could get any better, but Keith proves them all wrong with \\"Get Closer\\". All of the songs on the CD are great, Put You in a Song, You Gonna Fly, Without You, Georgia Woods, Right On Back To You are personal favorites. One listen to this CD and you will be hooked!!!
B002ZG981E|5.0|Movie is awesome and very well done.  Amazon advertised \\"get it the day it releases\\" with 2 day shipping which is incorrect.  The movie released to DVD yesterday and USPS does not expect a delivery until tomorrow (two days after the release).  If Amazon is going to advertise it, they should ensure it.  I can understand acts outside of their control, but Priority Shipping with USPS apparently does not garauntee the 2 day delivery.
B004FDY4LE|5.0|I have spoken. This is the best television show EVER to have been written. That's it. Nothing more to say.
B000UAFDP2|4.0|I am obliged to write this review in response to extreme bashing from Heinlein's fans. You see, I read the book and loved it, long before the movie was released; and when it did, I liked it also.    Literature and Movies are totally different media with different sensibilities. I'm my opinion, no movie will ever be superior to it's novel counterpart (perhaps with the exception of 2001 A Space Odissey when movie and novel were developed as one project, it's a tie). Having this in mind, I never compare movies and novels, it is impossible to recreate the details of days or weeks of story telling and self entertainment in one screen in two hours. As a footnote, I'm not counting movie tie-in books, I'm refering only to real classic or modern Literature that inspire movie projects.    So I acknowledge Heinleins's fans, of course the movie does not come close to the novel, but this also does not mean that the movie is bad. The starship troopers don't have power armory and there are many details and story development that are not taken into account, ie. the Bugs in the novel have spaceships, something not shown in the film and of course there is a general lack of depth, that is an obvious choice from the filmmaker...I could go on and on. Starship Troppers, the Movie, is just a free reimagining and an adaptation from the novel, is not a deliberate intent to recreate the novel in a movie. Director Paul Verhoeven and his writer make the main story their own and do what they please with it. Nevertheless, the Fascist type propaganda, the military aspects of this society and all their ironies and sarcasm are shown in a fine way.    Also, I do not care if our heroes are young, 'beautiful', light and sexy, some of them get their Bug stab! This is a serious science fiction film from the guy that brought to us Robocop and Total Recall, pretty good sci-fi stuff.    This film is no masterpiece, but Starship Troopers, both novel and movie are fun and cannot be missing in a serious sci-fi collection, in any form. So to all good Heinlein fans: relax.
B00436GNVC|5.0|I never liked Rockferry and the song \\"Stepping Stone\\" drove me crazy. I never understood the fascination with Duffy until I heard the \\"Smoke Without Fire\\" on \\"An Education\\" soundtrack. It just took my breath away, and this album has the same gorgeous vocals. It is very different from the \\"Rockferry\\" and there is a possibility that it will not be to the tastes of those who love \\"Rockferry\\". However, I would definitely recommend this album. The songs are full of emotion and this is quite a rare fit in modern musical industry.
142311339X|5.0|I have 7 year old twins.  We take long car trips 3 or 4 times a year to visit their grandparents.  We have listened to the first three books so far and we're waiting for the next road trip to start book 4.  These kids are only 7, but they are enjoying this series immensely and they can sit through an 8 hour car trip with complete focus as they follow the adventure.  Best part is, my husband and I are hooked too.  THis is fantastic entertainment for the entire family, even though the reading level itself is too advanced for my kiddoes.  They are able to listen and understand everything.  The narrator, Jesse Bernstein, does a great job.  I highly recommend this series for boys and girls...and even parents.
B004EI3ON4|1.0|Boring fake \\"classical\\", all meandering and moody and generic.    Buy the Sea of Simulation song and skip the rest.    What a total waste. Why on earth hire Daft Punk for this?
0525423273|5.0|I've given other books 5/5 star rankings, but now I am kind of regretting that because no book I have read this year comes even close to Anna and the French Kiss. If I could give it a 5+ star rating, I would. I have never felt so gushy over a book before, but this was seriously amazing.     I totally got sucked into Anna's world. The dialogue was fresh, the characters were real, and you can't help but cheer for Anna. I'm not a big fan of first person present tense, but I honestly didn't even notice it here, that is how effortlessly it read. The pacing was also spot on. I can't wait for Ms.Perkin's next offering!!!

Because of the fact that I'm against book burning, I loved this book so much that I went on amazon.com (when it went down to $5.99) and purchased a copy.
B004FDPOHC|5.0|Daft Punk fans should enjoy this dramatic soundtrack as fans who aren't familiar with the duo may still found this to be an epic masterpiece! At only $3.99, this is totally worth a download even for just the \\"Overture\\" and single \\"Derezzed\\".    There's no typical rock anthem, dance music, or classic song on here. This is purely a score to accompany intense dramatic scenes and action sequences.  I'm pumped for the movie now!
B001F3DY9A|5.0|I love this album (I got it on iTunes 'cuz i have a ipod) 5 star good job Taylor.  This part is for the lower star rating people. I love her voice and her country accent so don't think I'm saying it needs a lower rating. Half of doing things like this is having the courage to get on stage infront of millions of people and having a great time. Or in this case getting in the recording booth knowing that this will be unchangeable once the album has been released.
B002ZG981E|5.0|What more can be said that what's already been said?  The first movie in 10 years that I had to go see again immediately after my first viewing.  Love it still even now on blu-ray.

B003K025V4|5.0|I absolutely love this cd. Her \\"Every Rose\\" cover is better than the original. Get this cd, I highly suggest it to fans with suffisticated musical palets.
B000BISBDY|5.0|This is a very nice compilation but it is by no means complete.  If you're looking for broader overview, [[ASIN:B00005Y1M2 The Essential Johnny Cash]] is probably a better choice.  That one has the far superior live version of Folsom Prison along with a number of \\"essential\\" pieces missing from this collection.  Having said that, this CD has the better version of A Boy Named Sue and it also includes Hurt, which is missing from the other set.  I decided that I needed them both because neither one had everything I wanted.  I'm sure they planned it that way <grin>.
B002VECM6S|3.0|I really expected to like The Blind Side. Goodness had I heard good things about it, and from people whom I respect. And I didn't hate it. But I don't really expect that I'll watch it again ever.<br /><br />A couple of things annoyed me. First, some of these metaphors were really heavy-handed. The \\"blind side\\" metaphor, especially in that embarrassing scene at football practice, lost its resonance when the film explained it over and over to you. Second, I didn't like the cartoonishness in the film. I'm all for inspiring, rags-to-riches stories and for moments of humor. Humor, no matter how difficult life is, is present in just about any situation. But I thought that the cartoonish quality to this film really did detract from the very serious social issues of the real story. Compare The Blind Side with Slum-Dog Millionaire. Both are stories of men emerging from horrific, hopeless situations, but in Slum-Dog Millionaire, those issues are depicted without pulling punches. The Blind Side may be based on a true story, but as the story's told, it's more the fantasy than Slum-Dog.<br /><br />The strength of the movie is really the story that it's based upon, some of which leaks through the filmmaking. And I've always liked Bullock, and she's fine here (though this does seem to me like one of the sillier Oscar choices in recent times). But I really wish it weren't all so silly.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Very well-made and aesthetically pleasing case.  Nice and sturdy.  Although the fit is a bit snug (but I have only had it for a week - I'm guessing it will eventually soften a bit), but I'm very glad I bought it, as my previous headsets end up retired by looking so banged up as opposed to outliving their usefulness.  I normally leae them laying around in the car or on my desk.  Given the price if the Voyager Pro+, this holster is well-deserved.  I think they could have engineered it a bit smaller, but at least it will be hard to lose it.  Also lets me trade off between the headset and the stereo headphones without having them scattered all over the car.  Definitely recommend it.
B002PDDL8S|5.0|\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is a hoot of a movie.  It has the perfect cast, perfect script and a fantastic director.  My laughter could be heard across the house and I still think back on certain scenes to have a smile.<br /><br />The Hoover family is complex and dysfunctional but held together with deep bonds of love.  Greg Kinnear plays Richard Hoover, the head of the family and a failed motivation speaker.  He and his wife, Sheryl (Toni Collette), Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carell), depressed and the nation's number one Proust scholar, grandpa (Alan Arkin) a dirty old man on drugs,  Dwayne (Paul Dano) a teen boy who is mute by choice, and a sweet chubby, be-speckled eight year old,  (Abigale Breslin) into a mini VW bus for a three day trip to Los Angeles.  The starter does not work on this stick shift, so the only way they can start the VW is get out and push until it kicks the motor on.  I laughed so hard during these times I cried.  It is a hilarious satire with an important message on respect and love for family.  Crises, crushed dreams, persistence as well as trust and support for each other are deeply moving themes below the laughter.<br /><br />This is a must see and a real uplifting tale.
0525951652|3.0|I very much enjoyed this book.  I listened to the audio version and the reader was excellent.  I did not like it as much as Pillars of the Earth.  This was more of a soap opera than that.  The history was good.  I didn't mind the coincidental involvement of characters in important events that others complain about.  Those would be the people that the author would naturally pick to talk about if he wants to tell a historical story!  I am looking forward to the next installment.  I hope he doesn't soap opera up the Holocaust too much however.  I worry..
0312600844|1.0|Perhaps Mr. Franzen agreed to appear on Oprah's show and humbly accepted her choice of Freedom for her book club because he has now succeeded in writing one of those \\"schmaltzy\\" books he accused her of selecting for her book club in 2001 when she selected The Corrections.  How delightful for them that they made up.  Now the only ones who will lose are the unsuspecting lemmings who blindly follow Ms. Winfrey's reading recommendations and will spend their hard-earned money to put this schmaltzy tome under someone's Christmas tree.
1439107955|4.0|Love this book, as my husband is in cancer treatment right now.    However MAJOR error in the segment regarding the Werner Bezwoda clinical trials.  When they debunked the data - the following statement is made by the author: \\"Another patient record, tracked back to its origin, belonged to a man - obviously not a patient with breast cancer.\\"    This is a false and dangerous statement.  Men do have breasts and albeit rare, can develope breast cancer.  My husband is case and point.      Be alert, breast cancer is indiscriminate.
1844256383|5.0|I'm no expert, just a musician's father who wanted to know more about how this awesome instruments work and how to determine if the inevitable repair estimate was realistic. With this book I successfully tore down a complete Alto sax, cleaned it, learned the essentials of the mechanics of the keywork and am in the process of rebuilding it, repad and all. Kudos to the author for the excellent detail and great photos.  In my opinion any serious sax student should have this book on their \\"gift list\\"!

WONDERFUL !
B000068PQ0|5.0|If The Soft Bulletin was a modern-day Pet Sounds, then this album is a modern-day Dark Side of the Moon.  The difference, in my opinion, is that Dark Side of the Moon isn't all that great, while this album is fantastic.  I know, I know, I must be crazy for not liking DSotM, but for all of post-Barrett Floyd's studio mastery, I've always felt their songwriting was average at best.  In fact, I feel that in most of their concept-heavy albums (particularly DSotM and The Wall) Waters may have actually deliberately used lush soundscapes and philosophical lyrics in attempt to cover up his inferior (compared to Barrett) songwriting skills    But enough about Pink Floyd: Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots is like DSotM in terms of studio wizardry, except that the songwriting is excellent on every single track.  So if you DO love DSotM, you will love this maybe even more!  The first four tracks don't really fit the description I just gave, however.  Tracks 1 and 3 are pure pop excellence, upbeat jams with fun (but not stupid) lyrics and incredibly catchy hooks, plus some of that signature Flaming Lips quirkiness.  Tracks 2 and 4 are similar in style, both focusing on purely-electronic sounds (as opposed to the mix of electronic sounds and filtered instruments from 1 and 3) and VERY skillful drumming.  Track 2 is a groovy jam with a slick bassline and very in-the-pocket percussion, with loopy, falsetto-ey lyrics and smooth transitions from major to minor tonality.  Track 4 is an instrumental (mostly), actually Part 2 of the title track (track 3 is Part 1).  It focuses on the same pallete of sounds from track 2, but used to opposite effect: the synth is angry and glitchy, the drums are absolutely thunderous, cymbal-heavy, and have more elasticity, and the coldly-disconcerting falsetto has been replaced with ferocious female shrieks.  It's a wonderful piece.    After track 4 is where the DSotM parallels apply heavily.  The first four tunes are really, really great, and I do believemost critics say the album goes downhill afterward, but I would stalwartly disagree.  The rest of the album does have less energy, to be sure, but what it loses in catchiness it gains in compositional complexity and (like Pink Floyd) soundscape.  Everyone will surely have their own favorites, but I particularly like track 7, \\"Are You a Hypnotist?\\" and track 10, \\"All We Have is Now.\\"  The former is veeeeeerry DSotM-esque in terms of mood.  It's dark, emotional, and very dense.  A particularly good sonic effect is the speed oscillation of one of the backing tracks, creating a warbling sound similar to the music in old VHS tapes.  The minor-major shift at the end of the chorus is also incredibly effective.  Track 10 probably should have been the closer, and it is excellent.  It has a simple ABAB format, with only slight lyrical differences between A parts (2 lines), but three things make this track really stand out.  First, there is the melody itself, which is one of the best that the Lips have written, with a lilting rising-and-falling quality.  The second is a combination of Coyne's singing (delicate, precise, no vibrato) and the electronic effects laid over it (it seems like the overtones have been diminished, and the overall sound has been compressed and slightly electronic-ized), creating a flat, dry tone that somehow carries a very specific emotion.  It's both solemn and blissful, paralleling the dual nature of the song's lyrics (essentially: our time is short, which is sad, but we have Now and Now is beautiful and wonderful).  The final thing about this song is the rhythm.  Oh my goodness, the rhythm.  It's very simple: sparse percussion in part A, a tiny accelerando, and sparse percussion in part B.  But that accelerando is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.  The actual numerical amount of tempo increase, the speed at which it changes, the way the rest of the song follows it... everything about that little accelerando is marvelously executed and conveys as much emotion and meaning as the whole rest of the album, at least for me.    Okay, I'm done with this review.  The tracks I didn't mention are also all great (though the final track REALLY should not be the final track), but I'm not going to discuss them.  I talked about the first four because they are pop miracles that EVERYONE will probably love, and since the ones after that are more complex and ambiguous, everyone will probably have different opinions on them, so I just talked about MY favorites.  But they're all great, this album is great, and you should buy it right now.

B002ZG981E|2.0|The Dynamic Sound Range in Inception was extreme. I have to wonder if the sound was actually re-engineered for Blu-Ray. I have a decent sound system with an Integra DTR-40 AV Receiver and Fluance speakers. If I had the volume set to hear voices, which seemed overly soft in much of the movie, I was overwhelmed by noise in the action scenes. The system has been fine tuned over several months and although sometimes a particular event like a cannon boom might be a bit loud, Inception had me constantly turning down the volume and then back up again to hear the voices. I finally had to use the Late Night mode.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|Is it just me who thinks that this dvd is missing parts that were shown in the theatre? I thought the tent seen was longer, ending with a fight in the morning. Also, wasn't Alice making a comment about the diamond bracelet? Am I just imagining these scenes, and have just visualized them while reading the book? I could have sworn that I watched them in the theatre version. Other than that, I think this was the worst made one of all three movies. With choppy, rushed filming, shaky cameras (except in a couple of scenes where you can tell it was on purpose), and weird wigs, I definitely kept losing my concentration. Too many mistakes, should have hired a different director. We know that the actors can do the job from the previous movies, it's the director that has butchered the story...

B002KSPKRS|4.0|This is by far the best gaming headset for the 360, one downside is that it does NOT include the necessary adapter to connect it to the Xbox. If you are connecting the xbox via hdmi to your hdtv, you MUST have the AV adapter to route the sound to the headset. If you are just looking for a \\"game chat\\" headset, this has everything including the Optical Audio cable, but if you want the full surround sound experience, the adapter is needed in order to route the sound to the headset, so spend the extra $5-10 and get it!

B0043A0PXU|1.0|Yesterday, I got this record on LP. Agreed, it is an old-fashioned medium but with a decent installation it extracts sheer magic from good recordings. Unfortunately this recording is inferior in all aspects, however as a mockery it can and will hold its stand. For starters there is La Lennox who ruffles through the texts like a bored kid that sings only because it really has to. More like a machine than like a human. OK why not, finally it is her interpretation after all but even for a mockery a full recording with the cruise-control at a constant speed is a bit too much of a thing. And then there is the production. The occasional bells are well depicted in space and the placement of her voice is really well done. That's all the good news: The sound is completely compressed into a few decibels, estimated 2 or 3 dB -- I really could not make the effort to unpack my sound level meter, it is grotesque. The 'background chorus' is compressed in an even more exaggerated way and passed through a high-pass filter that took all the life out of those voices. On top of that there is an extraordinary amount of digital hiss or added background artifacts -- even through my all valves phono pre-amplifier it is unbearable. The bass is a one note only affair. Maybe interesting but mainly for masochists only. As she states is her foreword: \\"... The words from the bible, the torah, or the koran are too often misused to justify viewpoints that oppress, divide or create discord, rather than engendering empathy, harmony and respect for each other,...  ...Through listening to a Christmas Cornucopia, I hope that people will discover a fresh perspective.\\" Conclusion: unfortunately this clue is only revealed after one parted already with his or her money. Only recommended as a present by those who want to insult their granny or the vicar.

B004DZ0ABM|3.0|Bouquets first - I really enjoyed 3/4 of the first book and I finished the other two in quick succession to satisfy my curiosity and found them to be enjoyable. I haven't read any books set in Sweden so I reveled in the author's descriptions, as it is an unfamiliar place to me and I could easily imagine the settings he was writing about. The premise the initial book was built around i.e. solving an old mystery/disappearance was intriguing to begin with. Lisbeth Salander is an interesting character and her background story (which helps explain a lot of her actions)is revealed gradually and is well rounded and fascinating.<br />Brickbats - well I can't be specific as that would spoil it for those who haven't read the books so I'll just generalise. As I moved through the trilogy I found that most of the characters were cliches and caricatures and I couldn't help but think I've read about their type many times before. With each book the plot becomes more ridiculous and implausible with miraculous escapes, extraordinary coincidences and good luck abounding. Perhaps I am being too harsh but an ability to suspend belief, not dig too deep and simply enjoy the story for what it is will serve you well.<br />Larsson, I would equate to Sweden's answer to Wilbur Smith or Dan Brown and I'm not trying to be unkind as I have read and enjoyed these authors but I am just putting in perspective where these books sit for me. The fact that the books are very popular is neither here nor there but anything that gets more people reading like the aforementioned Dan Brown with The DaVinci Code can only be a good thing.<br />Like a good popcorn movie blockbuster if you just want to be entertained, not think too hard and don't expect literary greatness, but want something to read on the aeroplane or on a sun lounge next to the pool, these books will do nicely
0618918248|5.0|This book is designed to educate new and long-time skeptics alike. If you are of the latter, the first several chapters are redundant, as Dawkins explains that he is writing about Christianity, and not to be taken out of context towards other belief systems (i.e. Einsteinian religion).    The essential information begins at Chapter 5, as Dawkins explains how religion is a by-product of evolution and how religion is not responsible for one's morality.    Chapter 7 begins a critical assessment of the Biblical scriptures, examining problems with the Old and New Testaments and how these \\"good books\\" don't promote a positive lifestyle. In addition, the book discusses faith and homosexuality, faith and abortion, and the psychological effects of \\"religious abuse.\\"    Dawkins does an excellent job of citing a variety of sources throughout his book. The appendix has a detailed index of his sources, as well as recommended readings. (This led me to find a dozen more books relative to the topic.) He also provides an index of websites to locate articles that were not made available to the American public.

This is the perfect gift this CHristmas for a Keith Urban Fan.    This CD almost wasen't, because the day the floods hit Nashville was the day Keith was suppose to start making the CD, but because Keith has a Big heart he borrowed, and went to work and 6 months later we have \\"Get Closer\\"
185984054X|5.0|An excellent book exposing Mother Teresa's not-so-holy actions.    Mother Teresa's work is nothing but a fundamentalist religious campaign at the expense of the poor. She is one of the few untouchables in the mental universe of the mediocre and the credulous. However, the naive and simple are seldom as naive and simple as they seem.    Mother Teresa's global income is more than enough to create several first-class clinics in the third world. Instead, she creates shanty clinics that provide inadequate care. In one instance, a fifteen year old boy was diagnosed with a liver disorder. The disease could be cured with antibiotics, but with Mother not approving of the boy visiting the hospital, he did not receive treatment and eventually died.    Another instance appears closer to home, when Mother built a night shelter in the Bronx. She refused to add an elevator for the handicapped. The city offered to pay for the elevator, again, Mother declined, which resulted in the project becoming abandoned.    Mother also taught the Sisters how to secretly baptize the ill on their deathbed. Secrecy was key, as Sisters were baptizing Hindus and Muslims.    During a visit to Washington D.C., Mother declared that although, \\"God could find it in his heart to forgive all sinners, she herself would never allow a woman or a couple who had an abortion to later adopt one of 'her' babies.\\"  Why?  \\"Children born with appalling deformities and in overcrowded homes have been known to defy all odds and become exemplary...or merely human.\\"  It is true that in rare circumstances, these people may beat the odds. But that's the reason why there are \\"odds\\" associated with deformities and overcrowding. The majority of these people become a statistic in regards to psychological and lifestyle hardships when born into unfavorable conditions.    Mother Teresa speaks out against population control through contraceptives in third world countries. People are suffering. These same people become pregnant andbring a child into a volatile situation, where the adults can barely support and protect themselves, much less a new dependent.  Millions of children are dying of malnutrition and pestilence. How does one justify allowing another human to suffer and die while resources are available to prevent the pregnancy in the first place?    Lastly, Mother Teresa's charity received large donations from Charles Keating, who was convicted of defrauding $252,000,000 from several thousand investors of his company. Mother Teresa wrote a letter to the judge on Keating's behalf. After the conviction, the prosecutor wrote to Mother Teresa, kindly asking her to return the money donated by Keating to its rightful owners. The prosecutor suggested to imagine what Jesus would do if he were in possession of stolen money.    Years later, Mother Teresa has yet to respond to the letter.    To close with a quote from Hitchens:  \\"Religion is a means of marketing hope, of instilling ethical precepts on the cheap. \\"
B004EI3ON4|4.0|I expected a few more upbeat songs like \\"Derezzed\\" but the soundtrack is ultimately a film score and needs to display a range of sounds. In short, I love this album and if you like orchestra with beats youll love this too!

B0042JTDXK|5.0|Illuminations is definitely different from Groban's previous albums, but that was the intent, according to interviews he has given about the making of the album. It highlights a different side of Josh .. the contemplative, sensitive songwriter. The songs are poignant and touch the soul.  The vocals are the focus, and the orchestration is there to enhance them.  Like fine wine left to age, this album gets better with every listen.  Highly recommended.  You'll enjoy it for years to come.

B003EV6DBM|3.0|Okay, I'm not going to stop watching Doctor Who tomorrow, but Series 5 was a big letdown for me.  Voices get lost in the mix (on iTunes, anyway) and accents are often way too thick for my U.S. ears.  Never had this problem with Who before.  Similarly, lighting tends to shade the new Doctor's eyes under his enormous forehead, which doesn't help him to do much \\"acting.\\"  Sidekick Karen Gillian gets one of the best introductions of all time but is frequently irritating and unlikeable.  As is the Doctor.    And that, I think, is my biggest problem with the new series-- neither Amy nor the Doctor are nice people.  The two leads bounce around from place to place, getting people killed for forgettable reasons and chronically disagreeing.  More often than not, Amy will completely disregard the Doctor's orders and be right for doing so, since this Doctor is only right about 10% of the time.  There's really no believing that this sociopathic incarnation of the Doctor was once Eccleston or Tennant.  One episode has the Doctor putting a small child in danger because he forgets about him-- and not for laughs.  And since he's basically a pompous idiot this time around, one quickly begins to question why anyone would follow his lead.  Someone should at least be questioning his medical credentials, since he looks about 22 (another problem).    Tonally, Series 5 seemingly aims for a slightly older crowd, with a less fantastic feel and a more frank approach to sex.  The actual result feels about as mature as a Disney sitcom, but whatever.  The stories often continue from the popular Moffat works of previous seasons (River Song, the Weeping Angels, etc) and range from pretty good to mediocre.  The best episodes I think were the season opener, \\"The Lodger,\\" which solved some problems by separating the two leads, and the season finale.  (None would make my top ten.)  The season seems to sacrifice week-to-week quality for the promise of a big finale payoff, but it isn't as clever as theyhoped.    Oddly enough, I am a huge fan of producer/ writer Steven Moffat's other show, \\"Sherlock.\\"  That show also has a pompous sociopath in the lead role, but in that case it's appropriate.  Here's hoping Doctor Who grows up a bit next season.

0893860220|5.0|Review of I AM THAT: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj<br /><br />The book comes in at 550 pages including a Glossary, two Appendices (one detailing \\"Nisarga Yoga\\" and the other detailing the \\"Navanath Sampradaya\\" sect of Hinduism), a nice forward by Douwe Tiemersma, Faculty member of Erasmus Universiteit Holland, a nice intro to the Maharaj entitled \\"Who is Nisargadatta Maharaj?\\" (author not given) and  a Translators note by Maurice Frydman and an Editor's Note by Sudhakar S. Dikshit.<br /><br />The Maharaj Self-Realized in 3 years.  He met His Guru who told Nisar that he was the Supreme Reality.  The Maharaj believed his Guru alone.  Nisargadatta's Guru is His Holiness Shri Sadguru Siddharameshwar Maharaj.  Interestingly enough, the Maharaj was not able to spend much time on earth in his Holiness' physical presence as his Holiness died shortly after they met.  Perhaps this helped.  The Maharaj appears to have come quickly to his True State as the physical death of His Guru freed the Maharaj to his own form of Self-Discovery.  That form is immortalized in the Maharaj's name.  \\"Nisarga\\" means \\"natural\\", \\"innate\\" \\"inborn\\".  This can be discovered in the very helpful Glossary at the end of the book.  Thus, do we find that the Maharaj's name means \\"A holy king in his natural or innate state.\\"  This Self-Realized state is the Supreme Self, Paramatman, Pure Brahman.<br /><br />The Maharaj made no bones about That.  But, He preferred to leave it formless, shapeless and nameless as He did when He was asked to describe the Natural State.  Saying only that this State was available to all, this simple shopkeeper brought forth His teachings with lucidity and clarity.  He taught that one should simply meditate on the \\"I am\\" and then go beyond That.  He is fair-minded throughout these Discourses and never seems to tire of stating the Facts.<br /><br />Potential buyer, when you have completely identified with what you are not, then and only then do you know what you are in truth.

B000AARKOO|3.0|If you're into historical & religious epics, which I am, this is a really good movie in spite of having a major amount of time/details cut from it for the theatrical release. These theatrical time constraints leave the viewer wanting more as far as character backgrounds at the very least. I would say that feeling of \\"something's missing\\" likely contributed to this movie being considered a flop in theaters, unfortunately.<br /><br />If you're debating between purchasing this version [[ASIN:B000AARKOO Kingdom of Heaven (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)]] or [[ASIN:B000EHSVQ4 Kingdom of Heaven - The Director's Cut (Four-Disc Special Edition)]] I'd highly recommend choosing the latter. I've seen & own both versions. The Director's Cut definitely provides a much higher level of the character & plot development originally envisioned by Ridley Scott which makes the movie all the more gripping.<br /><br />This version, however, does contain 2 quite intriguing television documentaries (A&E's \\"Movie Real: Kingdom of Heaven\\"--approx 45 min & The History Chanel's \\"History vs Hollywood: Kingdom of Heaven\\"--approx 48 min) about the film that are not included in the 4-Disc Director's Cut, so I'm glad I own both versions!
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|Amazing experience! Great war scenes. A little too much \\"sex\\" and romance\\" for me. Not quite as good as Band of Brothers, but still better than most. Very dark in many scenes, but was finally able to see some battles in daylight toward the end. Take some time to watch, it's worth it. The men and women who went through this for our freedom are amazing! My take-a-way: We shoudl do everything possible to avoid any war.
B004EI3ON4|4.0|I was really intrigued to hear this soundtrack after watching the teaser trailer for TRON:Legacy, and then I had some trepidation after hearing clips of 'Derezzed.' As a longtime fan of electronic music, I've never been a huge fan of Daft Punk as their music has always seemed far too repetitive and monotonous. I feared that if this soundtrack were treated like a regular Daft Punk album, the tone would be all wrong, repetitive house music jarring with the cold, digital world of TRON.    Thankfully, my concerns were unfounded. The soundtrack reminds me more of something from [[ASIN:B000002GXA Tangerine Dream]] than a Daft Punk release, and that's okay with me. The plodding, arpeggiated synths paired with the orchestral backdrop sets exactly the right tone.
B002ZFQD0E|4.0|This music will be hard to classify. Big band, progressive hip hop pop? Janelle Monae is unique. Some songs aren't my cup of tea such as Make the Bus but others I just can't get out of my head such as Wondaland or Tightrope. There is good music out there. We just have to search for it until it's known by all the masses. So glad to see she's got a Cover Girl deal. The young lady is adorable.
0743201140|1.0|What a waste of money and time! This book has some valuable information, but primarily if you are buying it new. What they don't tell you is that if you is that if you want to take their assessment and find out your \\"type\\" you have to go online and enter a code that is contained in the jacket of the book. It is for one user only. Without being able to take the assessment, the book is basically worthless.<br />I contacted the company to see if there was another way to take the assessment. I wasn't looking for a handout, and I was willing to pay a fee to take the assessment. However, they informed me the only way I can take the assessment is to buy another copy (obviously a new one) of the book. I disagree with that practice and think a book should be reasonably self-contained or at least it should be clear that the book's only value is if it is purchsed new.<br />So unless you buy it new, SAVE YOUR MONEY. And to the Gallup International Research & Education Center, I say you have ruined your reputation in my eyes.

0802798225|5.0|This book taught me a very important lesson:  Don't judge a book by its cover. Ever.  For a long time I kept seeing this book around and never bothered to pick it up because I HATED the cover!  It just looked so cheesy to me.  Eventually, I finally gave in & decided to go for it because of all the 5 star reviews.  Now, Perfect Chemistry has become my all time favorite book!<br /><br />Alex & Brittany are two very different people with two very different lives.  People from the North side don't get involved with people from the South side.... or do they?  Brittany is your typical All-American rich, blonde, attractive cheer leader; Alex is the poor, gang-banger, sexy Latino, bad-boy.  They get paired up as Chemistry partners and from that point on their relationship takes on a beautiful, heart-felt journey.  This book is told in both Brittany's & Alex's point of view which makes the book even more amazing because you get a feel for what both of them are feeling and thinking.  It switches POV's every couple of pages or so.<br /><br />The character's, the plot, just everything about this book was very realistic.  This is just one of those books that stay stuck in your mind for weeks after you read it.  I read it in 2 days, and 3 weeks later; I read it AGAIN.  It is absolutely AMAZING & I highly recommend it.  If I could rate this 100 stars, I would!
B002ZG999U|4.0|It was great seeing all these action heroes together. When Arnold walked on for a cameo, I knew I had the right movie. Of course, you have to understand I love action movies (rambo, terminator, transporter, etc.)but this one really hit the spot. Not much of a storyline, but it was great to see these fading heroes resurrect the past. Stretch your imagination a little, and you are there. I can't wait until they make another one. You will won't you?
B004EI3ON4|2.0|Hate to say it but the majority of the tracks here are highly derivitive of both the Dark Knight & Inception soundtracks.  I pray that Hans Zimmer will receive his royalty check shortly.    That said, there are worst composers to copy.  I'm sure these tunes will enhance the movie nicely.
0525423273|5.0|I was lucky enough to get this book free on the Kindle when they offered it for a few hours. That being said, I would pay full price for this book in a heart beat. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. The characters and their emotions are so real that you feel every scene. The emotions of young love and dealing with the turmoil of sick or narcissistic parents make your heart ache for these characters.    I can't wait for Stephanie Perkins' next book!

B001AQO3QA|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already be said? This set is the ultimate Blu-ray compilation. Practically anything fans of the films ever wanted to know, see or hear can be found here. The presentation is unbelievably cool with detailed information scrolling on screen at the menus about creatures, vehicles, locations, etc. The amount of extras is staggering and will take some time to go through, but that's a good thing.<br /><br />Some have complained about having too much stuff included and asking who needs more than the films themselves. Uh...WHAT?! Personally, I have a hard time grasping the concept of someone complaining about getting too much for their money. Makes no sense to me...about as much sense as some gamers complaining about too much to do in a video game.<br /><br />If you're a die hard fan of the Alien films...ANY of them...you'll find plenty here to satisfy.<br /><br />My only complaint about the set is the removal of one piece of behind the scenes footage. Originally, it was intended to have footage of James Remar playing Hicks in Aliens. James Remar was originally cast as the marine corporal, but was replaced by Michael Biehn shortly after principal photography began due to \\"creative differences\\" with writer/director James Cameron. The footage was removed before release of this set at the request of Cameron's production company Lightstorm Entertainment. As to why, your guess is as good as mine. Maybe someone will be kind enough to put it on YouTube someday.<br /><br />As for this set, buy it...it's awesome.
0307272702|5.0|This book is going among my collection that I refer to as my owner's manuals. I am always amazed at how much the average person understands about a variety of hobbies and topics, but generally how little they know about their own health. This book takes everything discovered since the late 1700's about why people get fat and puts it into one place, it's a great anthropological study of humanity and our ever increasing waistlines.    Beginning in the last century with a look at the Great Depression and childhood obesity, Gary Taubes begins putting together the pieces of the fat puzzle in a way that is interesting to read and easy to understand. He takes a look at some of the most notable researchers in physics, nutrition, and medicine and explains how WWII destroyed the momentum that we were once making in the field of nutrition research and has set us back decades in our understanding of how the human body uses the food we eat to fuel it. He explains in detail and backs with science why losing or gaining weight is NOT as simple as calories in and calories out and why we have been led to believe that in present time. He discusses why diets succeed and why diets fail, metabolic syndrome, and a host of diseases that are all directly related to our diets (type II diabetes, cancer, and heart disease among them).  This book is absolutely fascinating and was incredibly informative. Taubes really does an outstanding job with this piece, but if you are looking for a \\"diet\\" book that will give you menus and tell you what to do and when, this is not it.  The heart of this book is explaining how and why refined carbohydrates literally disturb the proper functioning of our entire systems and cause us to get fat.    Having taken formal nutrition classes at a major university as well as being an avid read of nutrition books, I have to say this is one of my favorites and one that leaves me fuming at the broken system of information that we have in this country.  One of the most startling things from this book for me was this;  \\"...in this case we are told to eat less fat and more carbohydrates, and rather than avoid heart disease and get thinner, as authorities had hoped we would, we've had as much heart disease as ever, and dramatic increases in obesity and diabetes. A more insidious problem is that all involved-the researchers, the physicians, the public-health authorities, the health associations-commit themselves to a beleif early in the evolution of the science, arguably at the stage at which they know the least about it, and then they become so invested in their belief that no amount of evidence to the contrary can convince them that they are wrong.\\"    I believe I will be a healthier person as a result of reading the science behind how carbohydrates are harmful. Gary Taubes is quite a gifted writer and researcher, he puts an incredible amount of information into a rather short and easy to read book that should be required reading for anyone who goes to medical school as well as anyone whoe is capable of eating solids.

1439152780|5.0|It actually took almost a month for me to finish this book.  That is a VERY long time for me .. but it wasn't because I didn't love it.  Other review commitments with firm dates kept dodging in; it's a pretty big book; and .. well, it's the type of book you don't rush through.<br /><br />It's not a complicated read.  It's a book that you want to savor.  I found myself thinking once, \\"It's like dipping your finger into a chocolate fondue made of words.\\"<br /><br />Even though I kept getting sidetracked, I kept this on my living room table (the home of THE book I most want to read at the time), and every time I opened it, it was like meeting an old friend.  As I slipped right back into the river of it's softly flowing pages, it was as though I'd never left.  There's a classic writing style at play here (think Jane Eyre) that makes you feel almost as though you should be reading a great historical fiction novel, even though it's in a contemporary setting.<br /><br />It begins and ends with The Mud Man.<br /><br />Raymond Blythe is the tragically deceased owner of Milderhurst Castle, He was also the author of The Mud Man, a favored children's story.  We start the novel with an excerpt.<br /><br />Edie is the main protagonist, very literary, who works for an indie publisher.  Her love of books began with The Mud Man.<br /><br />Edie's mother, Meredith, receives a letter from a bag of mail that a postal worker failed to deliver 50 years ago.  Her reaction to the letter, even though she attempts to cover it up, isn't lost on her daughter.  When Edie finds out that her mother was one of the English children sent to live in the countryside with strangers at the beginning of the war, she resolves to find out more.<br /><br />Enter Milderhurst castle, where the three Sisters Blythe still reside.<br /><br />Persephone (Percy):  There was something fundamentally broken at the heart of Percy Blythe, something queer and defective and utterly unlikable.  That she should contemplate, even for a second, the ease with which she might deprive her sister, her infuriating, beloved twin, of happiness.<br /><br />Seraphina (Saffy) and her dreams:  The wireless would be her only companion, and she'd pause in her typing throughout the day to listen to the weather reports, leaving briefly the world she was creating on the page to gaze through the window at the clear, smokeless London sky.<br /><br />And poor, doomed Juniper, the youngest:  Away from the castle, away from the world of Raymond Blythe, the terrible things he'd told her, his seeping guilt and sadness, she was free.  There'd been none of her visitors in London, there'd been no lost time.  And although her great fear had followed her, the fear that she was capable of harming others, it was different here.<br /><br />There's mystery, and madness.  Suicides, murder and secrets.  There are surprises, both good and bad, and betrayals, and seeming-betrayals.  There are lost loves, and graspingly mad possession.  When you think you have a mystery figured out, it turns on you. When you say to yourself, \\"Ah!  NOW I have it!\\", you find out that you don't.  And you won't ... almost to the very end.<br /><br />This book was so wonderfully-written that I don't have the words or the space to do it justice.  Buy it and read it.<br /><br />QUOTES:<br /><br />I was sunk then by the sense that I knew everything and nothing of the person sitting next to me.

B0017JKEL8|5.0|My first issue when ordering this item from outside the US is whether it will play.  The info shown with this title is that it won't play in NZ.  However, past experience has led me to be skeptical.  I ordered it with an 80% chance of it being okay - which it was!  So those of us in the South Pacific are good to go with this Blu-ray.  Crystal clear image on three disks with an easy format to view.  I plan to collect the set, as I'm an avid Mad Men fan.  My favourite character is Roger Stirling.

B002ZG981E|5.0|I saw this movie twice at the theater and the first time I saw it I was a bit confused.  It's like Vanilla Sky in the way because it made you think is this reality or is it a dream?  The ending had be a bit confused, which I won't give away, but I think everyone comes out of watching this movie with their own thoughts or ideas.  I really like the acting as well as the visual effects in this movie and would recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen this movie.  The movie is 2 1/2 hours long but it keeps your brain thinking the whole time. I really enjoyed movies that make you think besides movies that are full of explosions and cursing that don't make any sense.
0812550706|5.0|It is difficult to write a review for a book so popular and so loved.  In short: I enjoyed it very much and will be reading it again in the future.  The most impressive part about the book is that regardless of when it was written, it is still relevant to today.  That is one of the most telling features of any piece of art: people will come back to it always finding something new and relevant.    I was completely absorbed while reading the book.  It was difficult to get other work done before I had finished the book.  Whenever I paused from my reading my mind folded over what I had read, trying to keep these characters children in my mind's eye.  After finally finishing the book completely, my mind still brings it to mind every week or so.  I've been able to compare it to things I hear in the news, new technology coming out, other art, etc.  At first I was focused on finding the legitimacy in children accomplishing these things.  Then I focused on the whole system, ends justifying means.  Now, weeks later, I am more interested in the dream/computer game side of the story.  While reading I was fascinated by the world Ender explored, a world/game the computer made as it learned about Ender.  The thought of a computer having this capability is mind boggling in the first place.  The way Scott Card describes the game draws the reader in along with Ender so that I have found myself wishing I had something similar to loose myself into.  Raised on Disney princess movies I enjoy entertaining the thought that I could escape into some woodland with dwarfs, playgrounds and towers.  That, I think, is the power of the novel and writing.  It is not only enjoyable, it holds you long after you've put the book back on the shelf.  You may be done with the book, but the book is not done with you.  I look forward to discovering the book again in the future, exploring more in the following books and passing on this novel to others.  Please read, and enjoy.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I agree with other reviewers that this is a terrific movie.  My husband and I laughed at many scenes.  It is a bit \\"scary\\" for a 2-year old in a couple places.<br />My toddler doesn't mind but I wasn't sure about the need for so much tension and emotion in the \\"landfill.\\"

0061120073|4.0|Like us, you'll find it very difficult not to fall in love with little Francie Nolan.      While you may not pull an all nighter to finish this one, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a must read.  The plot is delightfully complex, though, primarily surrounds the childhood of a lonely girl who loves books (now you know why we're so fond of her).  Her family is stricken with many hardships including poverty and alcoholism, although her dad possesses one of the most underappreciated singing voices in all of literature.  Symbolism is prevalent throughout and even Francie herself represents the American dream.    For us it was so much fun to watch Francie bloom, ironically enough, much like a tree.  We found it very easy (almost too easy...) to get caught up in each one of her successes and failures.  There's also a whole cast of great characters that evolve and mature throughout the story.  In the spirit of the holiday season, we double-dog dare you not to crack a smile at some of Aunt Sissy's antics.
0439023521|3.0|The Hunger Games is a fair novel.    For those who have not read a plot summary anywhere else, The novel takes place in a dystopian future on the continent that used to be North America (now Panem).  The government, in order to show their total dominance, takes two children from each of the twelve districts of Panem (one male, one female, both between the ages of 12 and 18) and forces them to fight to the death in a controlled wilderness environment while the entire nation watches.  The Hunger Games follows Katniss Everdeen, one of the contestants from district twelve.    The characters are distinct, have good motivations, and are consistent all the way through.  I especially liked how Collins was able to show the personalities of the side characters through the biases of the point of view character.  This is not an easy thing to do in first person, but she manages to do it fairly well.    The setting is a little less impressive.  The setting is not enough of a focus in the novel for it to be fleshed out more than to say \\"Oh, by the way, there are genetically engineered super wasps in this world.\\" Even so, the political aspects of Panem seem a little off.  The author was clearly trying to portray a harsh oppressive government, but I got the impression that the government was only evil in the ways that were necessary for the plot.    This brings me to my real problem with the novel.  The premise of The Hunger Games does not hold up very well.  The hunger games are supposedly done to show the government's dominance, but that does not work because in half the districts the young people clamor and beg to participate.  Also, the victors turn into local heroes for the rest of their lives.  The victors have no reason to like the government, and have a few extra reasons to hate it.  It just does not seem to be an effective way of quenching dissident thought.  This becomes especially glaring when the last couple chapters hint that the sequel will focus on the repercussions of the main character's fairly mild rebellion during the games.    I also disliked the sheer number of coincidences in the novel.  I cannot list them without spoiling too much of the novel, but they add up quite quickly.    I liked the idea that the book essentially took reality television to its most brutal extreme.  Unfortunately, it was not explored enough.  The romance subplot explored the question of \\"How much of this show is faked?\\", but beyond that there was not enough analysis or deconstruction to make it interesting.    I would recommend this book to those that like action and survival stories, but if you are looking for a book with a good solid plot I would recommend finding something else.
1936594293|5.0|There was a time in our 20's and into our 30's that a slight film covered our lives.  Metaphorically speaking, of course, we were wandering around in our own world of literary complacency.  We never realized this, though much like those Claritin D commercials, all our surroundings became sharper and brighter, due to Jane Austen and her charming novel, Pride and Prejudice.  We would ask you, oh kind reader, to cast every last ounce of your sense and sensibility aside and read this book.  Just be careful that in hast you don't pick up Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, which has a slightly different take on this classic love story.<br /><br />Miss Elizabeth Bennett is the second oldest of five girls raised in a poor(ish) family on the English countryside, outside of London.  Smart, funny, passionate, loyal, and a tad bit prideful, she is the literary heroine of our dreams.  Enter Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth with a pair of awesome sideburns).  Seemingly arrogant, self righteous, and uppity; our Eliza quickly decides what he can do with all his preconceptions.  Upon our word, there is hardly a man quite as standoffish and rude as this gentleman... or is there?  Don't be too quick to pass judgment.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice is likeable on so many different levels.  Austen does an amazing job of changing rudeness into shyness, fierce animosity into extreme thankfulness, and all around bad guys into good ones...and then changing them back with the snap of her fingers.  Pride and Prejudice stands as one of our absolute favorites and we are still anxiously awaiting an invitation to Pemberley Estate so we can check out Darcy's impressive home library.
B003GDFQX4|3.0|Maybe I just don't like this genre, but I thought this book was average.  I heard some guy on the radio saying this was the greatest book ever written and I bought a copy for my Kindle.  The writing is unexceptional and in places is poor.  Yes, it's a clever story line, but much of the book is tedious (extensive descriptions of guns and target practice).  If you like this kind of thing then the Bourne books are a much more exciting ride in my view.<br /><br />I don't read this kind of thing very often and after I do I vow never to do so again, but I get sucked in every few years or so.  I must confess that I am not the target audience for this kind of book.  If you love thrillers and spy stories, you may think this is great, but to me it was just average.  (I mean, at the end of the day you know how it has to end!!!! DeGaulle was not assassinated!!!!)

B0046MOV8U|5.0|If I'm not mistaken, this is Beyonce's fourth concert DVD.  The first was essentially her solo debut, and was excellent, though lacking the refinement which was still to come.  The second was a strong contender for being my favorite, presenting us with a full concert recorded in LA, replete with spectacle, yet frequently able to move me emotionally in many directions.  The third was a definite change in approach, deliberately intimate, and thus revealing the person of Beyonce with a vulnerability we hadn't seen before.<br /><br />Now this fourth DVD combines some elements from the previous three, while deleting some elements and adding new elements, and is therefore something quite different overall.  First of all, this tour has a modern feel, with a crisp looking stage and lighting, aerial acrobatics, a mini stage in the middle of the audience, etc.  The DVD itself is actually assembled from more than 100 performances worldwide.  This approach has the drawback of creating fragmentation, with many of the songs apparently being incomplete, so the effect is more like watching a mosaic rather than a single coherent and flowing concert.  Added to this, interspersed between the songs, we get mini interviews with Beyonce and other documentary-like clips, which contribute further to the sense of fragmentation.  Last but not least, we don't get to see as much of her superb band or dancers as I'd like, since the spotlight is more tightly focused on Beyonce than before.<br /><br />While these are certainly drawbacks, the distinct upside of this approach is that, like a documentary, this DVD gives us a real sense of what it's like to actually be Beyonce, particularly while she's on tour, with all the pros and cons that entails.  In this sense, this DVD is even more revelatory than the previous one, displaying a Beyonce who's now secure enough to openly tell us that she experiences moments of insecurity.  She appreciates her gifts and success, while also wanting us to know that a lot of hard work and internal struggle goes into creating the externally charmed life that she leads.  She looks like a goddess on stage, but she also lets us frequently see that she looks a lot more like you and me without her makeup and styling.  She expresses sincere gratitude for her team and audience, but she also tells us that she has moments on tour when she feels very alone.  In short, she wants us to remember that, while she's a superstar, she's also human ...<br /><br />For me, the bottom line is that I remain a huge fan of Beyonce, grateful that this DVD offers us yet another window into her artistry and life, not to mention a concert mosaic well worth watching.  If you're also a fan of Beyonce, this DVD is a must.  If you're not yet a fan, this DVD (or either of the previous ones) may convert you.  And remember that Beyonce's natural niche is stage performance, with all the theatrical elements that entails, so don't think you've genuinely experienced Beyonce if you've only listened to her songs or watched her videos - neither of those formats does justice to her.<br /><br />My next step will be to try to watch Beyonce live in concert, and of course I eagerly look forward to her next DVD as well.ork and internal struggle goes into creating the externally charmed life that she leads.

0451228375|3.0|A book of over 1000 pages has to have several villains, and this one has at least four.  Two are monks, one is a murderous nobleman, and one is an overrated carpenter.  The action takes place in England in the 1300s and follows its main characters from childhood to middle age.  During that time the plague rips through Europe, leaving entire families demolished, houses abandoned, and fields uncultivated.  Religious figures rule and see the plague as God's punishment for man's (and woman's) lascivious ways.  Simple health procedures like avoiding contact with victims and hand-washing are just coming into practice, but the clergy sees these precautions as unnecessary and even heretical.  Caris is a forward-thinking woman who reluctantly becomes a nun on the eve of her wedding in order to avoid a death sentence for witchcraft.  Her erstwhile fianc&eacute; Mirthen is a talented architect who is also way ahead of his time and devastated by Caris's fate.  Gwenda is a peasant, forced to help support her family by pick-pocketing, and her father trades her to an outlaw in exchange for livestock.  I had to marvel at the author's ability to manage a zillion characters and intertwine their lives.  However, his writing style is neither lyrical nor memorable.  I do remember enjoying The Pillars of the Earth, this book's prequel, but that was at least 15 years ago, and my literary tastes have changed since then.  So I'm curious as to who's the audience for this book.  Not the book clubbers.  And not the casual reader, because its length is far too intimidating.  I guess it's readers like myself who just wanted to relive their Pillars experience.  Also, I was under the incorrect assumption that Fall of Giants was a follow-up to this book, but, no, it's the daunting (almost 1000 pages) first book in a projected trilogy.
B002ZG981E|4.0|I had a coworker tell me she saw this in the theaters and she highly recommended it to me. I was somewhat hesitant because I had heard so little of this movie and just haven't been a Decaprio fan for a while.<br />I was wrong in this case. For the most part this movie is well worth the watch. The only sub-par moments were:<br />-There are parts where not only are they in someone's dream attempting to extract information, but they are in a dream, within a dream and although it wasn't \\"difficult\\" to follow, it was more \\"annoying\\" to follow. Some people have complained that they had difficulty following the plot because they didn't know if the characters were in a dream or the real world so they gave this movie an unjustified 1-2 stars. Just because a person couldn't follow the plot doesn't make this a bad movie.<br />-This is a smart, thinking person's movie. Well acted, well written and well made. You just have to keep in mind that there's more than one reality here and it doesn't move in perfect chronological order and you will enjoy it.<br />-The regular DVD (disc 3) only has the movie and \\"languages\\". There are no special features and extras on the regular DVD at all. For some reason, they put the full bluray movie on one disc and then special features on disc 2 that are also bluray only. So, if you buy the 3 pack and plan to watch the regular DVD on an oldschool DVD player, you will get the movie only.
1439181780|2.0|Unfortunately, this book offers nothing new. I recognize it is a nice edition, well developed and well presented. Too much emphasis on love as the power, which other authors have already published as Carnelian Sage. You can agree or not with this concept, but nothing is new or surprising.

0439023491|5.0|Dystopia, Big Brother and post-apocalypse are themes that have been included in novels so often that it could well be a life's work for a librarian to prepare an exhaustive catalogue of titles. But, in terms of quality, the devil is in the details and Suzanne Collins has justifiably taken the world by storm. Suzanne Collins HUNGER GAMES trilogy, inspired by the legend of Theseus and the Minotaur, is an innovative, dare I say unique, young adult twist on the recurring themes of violence, cruely, despair, privation and revolution that are the mainstays of these types of novels.<br /><br />A distant future North America, now called Panem, is divided into 12 distinct economic districts ruled with an iron fist from the Capital located in the northwest Rocky Mountain region of the former USA. Every year, in a bizarre celebration called \\"The Reaping\\", the Capital \\"honours\\" each district by selecting two children that will be called \\"tributes\\", one boy and one girl, to participate in the Hunger Games. The 24 children are released into a wilderness arena and are expected not only to survive but to battle one another to the death. The last remaining child is returned to his or her district as a conquering hero.<br /><br />The games, reminiscent of Rome's bloodthirsty gladiatoral combats, are televised as an extravaganza throughout Panem on a minute by minute basis. Carefully engineered from start to finish, the sculpted terrain of the \\"arena\\" might be anything from arctic or forest to desert or rugged mountains; an unknown supply of weapons and supplies are provided but will have to be fought for and \\"won\\" as part of the entertainment; the games are replete with intermittent technologically engineered disasters such as fires, teeming rainstorms, rogue waves, insect infestations or earthquakes; genetically engineered humans or animals called \\"muttations\\" are periodically released to provide extra challenge for the tributes or extra entertainment for the viewing audience.<br /><br />Of course, the entire affair is intended to serve notice to Panem of the continuing absolute authority of the Capital over the Districts. Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, the tributes from the perennial underdog District 12, having acted in an entirely unforeseeable manner, survived against all odds as the first dual Games' winners in Panem's history. Although it wasn't their intention to embarrass the Capital and Panem's ruthless president, that unprecedented joint survival is now serving as a lightning rod for years of accumulated hunger, deprivation, slavery, anger and dissatisfaction in the country. Panem is a tinderbox and the firestorm of revolution is but one careless tossed match from ignition.<br /><br />In an attempt to defuse the focal point of the growing rebellion, the Games' rules are arbitrarily changed to ensure that Peeta and Katniss are selected and forced to participate in a second Hunger Games. Clearly the fix is in! Katniss and Peeta are only too aware that they cannot be allowed to survive the Games. But it is also obvious that the engineers of the Games' challenges haven't considered the depth of ingenuity that results from an indomitable will to live or from love, honour, loyalty, friendship, courage and heroism. Knowing that this time around, there will definitely be only one winner, both Katniss and Peeta are determined to sacrifice themselves to ensure the ultimate victory of the other!<br /><br />Readers and reviewers comment on the failings of the second book of trilogies so often that one almost comes to expect it. But, make no mistake, there are no such shortcoming in CATCHING FIRE! If I may say so, the title is an apt metaphor for the continuing effective plot and pacing of the trilogy. The story moves with lightning speed. Katniss and Peeta grow and mature into outward looking young adults, aware of their importance in the political changes that are happening in their country, aware of their responsibility for each other's lives and the lives of their friends and families. They grow increasingly confused about the depth, complexity and even the very nature of their feelings toward one another. They begin to embrace their leadership role in a revolution that is clearly picking up momentum and it is clear that the President of Panem is losing his iron grip on an increasingly hostile and dissatisfied populace.<br /><br />And, as if the magnificent story of CATCHING GAMES wasn't enough to stand on its own, Suzanne Collins has ended it with a positively hair-raising one line cliff hanger that will ensure her readers gasp and move on to THE MOCKINGJAY still holding their breath!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weissives and the lives of their friends and families.

B00009RGBS|5.0|This movie was fantastic. I loved everything about it -- the cast, the music, the performances, the story. I am not usually big fan of Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, but she really was a perfect Roxie Hart. And Catherine Zeta-Jones--wow, I had no idea she could sing and dance! Be sure to watch the behind the scenes featurette, I really enjoyed getting a glimpse into the making of the movie and learning more about the actors. A must see!
B00127RAJY|5.0|These workouts kicked my butt!!! I was hesitant to purchase this DVD but after reading all of the positive reviews, I had to give it a try. I have been trying to lose about 10lbs of baby weight for almost a year now. I started to feel like there was no way I was ever going to feel good about my body again. I felt weak, tired, and heavy all the time. It was awful! I am only 4'11\\" so an extra 10 lbs on me makes a HUGE difference. I purchased this DVD and figured I would be bored with level 1 but I gave it a shot anyway. Boy was I wrong! I had to stay at level 1 for almost a month!  I did read several reviews about the workouts being tough on the knees...I have had surgery on one knee and have had lots of problems with the other. I will admit that for the first month I did notice my knees hurting a bit but now they feel better than they have in years! It is SO important to pay attention to form when doing lunges and squats and also try not to land with too much force when doing the jump moves. This can be tricky when it's the last circuit, you're exhausted, you're legs are shaking and you're trying to do jump squats. It does get easier though! I am finally at level three and I am so proud of myself. I can't remember the last time I had this much energy. I still have about 5lbs to lose but I know that if I stick with the workouts I can reach my goal. I have only been doing the workouts three times a week and slacked a bit when I first started but I'm positive that if you're dedicated you WILL see results! I notice a tremendous improvement in my stamina and my strength. It feels great!

B0044XV3R8|1.0|I eagerly awaited the release of the Extended Collector's Edition of Avatar, passing on the DVD release of the Original Theatrical Version.  I was deeply disappointed to discover that all three versions of the movie is presented in two parts on two separate discs.  It is technologically possible to put a 3 hour movie on 1 disc...look at King Kong or The Lord Of The Ring Trilogy by Peter Jackson.  Then there is the Blu-ray version of the Extended Collector's Edition which has all three versions of Avatar on 1 disc.  In my humble opinion, the DVD version of the Extended Collector's Edition should have included the extended cut, special bonus features that takes the viewer behind the scenes and a digital copy of the Theatrical version. Despite the hours of bonus features, I feel as though this product was a waste of my hard earned money.

B00177Y9ZC|3.0|Jumper is a movie that could have been so much better. It clocks in at 88 minutes and feels therefore quite rushed. The movie could have easily been at least 100 to 110 minutes long. Hayden Christensen is alright in the role as David Rice. Samuel L Jackson though is amazing in the role as Roland and this part could have been given more background and time. The special effects are nothing special. If this movie had been done in the 90's it would be amazing but having been done 2008 I have this before and better. All in all this is an alright movie that is marred by its short time. 3/5.

B002QW7AJY|3.0|I found this film to be somewhat too slow paced and confusing. Don't get be wrong I followed the storyline and plot points pretty well, but some obscure references about Quaids wife and some other points, such as why there was a guy who only spoke Vietnamese on the ship, just kind of passed me by. Being a person who likes Dennis Quaid I was dissappointed that his scenes were a bit few and far between. The nasties were a bit ridiculous and perhaps the storyline with the main characters could have been more solidified and expanded. I also found the film to be weighted more to the horror genre than the science fiction. I would have preferred it the other way round myself. All in all it was a reasonably well shot film with several twists and turns if not a little lacking in storyline. I would suggest [[ASIN:B001GMH8TC Event Horizon [Blu-ray]]]for a better lost spaceship film.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie LOOKED bad: the trailers made it look like a movie made of purely nerdy but stupid jokes leaving no room for other people to be interested while insulting nerds' intelligence.  So, is this movie loaded with obscure references to video games, anime, rock bands, and comic books? Well, yeah. But even without that the movie is loaded with witty dialogue, a clever story, a fantastic cast, and great action.  For fans of the graphic novels: is it better? No. Is it totally faithful to the original story? No. But is it a solid telling that translates well to the big screen? Hell yeah.  Also, the music is phenomenal.  Is my review biased? Yeah - this movie was crafted for my demographic. I feel absolutely catered to by this film.
B00166BL6Y|5.0|Having bought the original LP, when it was new: Jethro Tull has always be one of the top groups you could rely on. \\"Dharma For One\\" used to be a favorite as are any songs that Ian Anderson shines. \\"Stand-up\\" also comes to mind as a classic as well as the overplayed \\"Aqualung\\".The stereo version of \\"This Was\\" is excellent. The vendor I bought it from, in Scotland delivered it promptly.
B001AQO3QA|3.0|As Ripley is preparing to self-destruct the ship, there's a bit of flutter for a couple inches at the bottom of the screen.....noticeable, but not overly annoying as I didn't return it....    This is based on the Irish packaged set.
B000FC1BZG|5.0|i thank god for ms austen. amazing writing, i just don't have the words. I recommend this book to everyonnneeeeee. You will not regret it for one second. Everyday spare moment was dedicated to reading, even sneaking at work.
0385523386|4.0|I read this on a cruise.  It seems realistic, and provides details of being in a woman's minimum security prision.  There was not a lot of drama, because I believe a lot of drama did not occur.  The author tried to keep out of trouble.    I liked the fact that she took responsibility for what she did, and accepted that even though she played a small role in the drug trade the drug trade was responsible for many broken families and lives.    I would have liked her to continue the book as to how she adjusted when back in society.  She also quit shacking up with her boyfriend and they got married.  That should tell you something about the institution of marriage.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Scott pilgrim is a movie locked in a video game and it kind of works. Sex Bob Omb is the name of his band and the incredible beauty Anna Kendrick plays his sister, Anna could have been in it a lot more and it would have been better if she played his love interest. A solid 8/10
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This movie is amazing. I first saw this on a flight to Europe and had to buy it when I got back to the States. The story is very well laid out the acting is superb in my opinion. It has its ups- it has its downs and the ending is just right.
B003YOZNBU|4.0|a good revenge movie, story line was ok but not a good ending, the movie is better if ur into megan fox.
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|Well well, Clint Eastwood- you did it again. This movie encompasses the racial tensions present in many immigrant cities in this country. I found the movie ve interesting- the ending seemed a little sudden but I would watch it again
0739358049|5.0|I love to read. It is an opportunity to walk in someone else's shoes. Unfortunately, I do not have time to sit with a book and concentrate, so I opt for recorded books. These work out great for my many daily treks in my car, and vacation drives.<br />Into the Wild was a walk worth taking, not only across the country and the Alaskan wilderness, but into a mind that listened to a different drummer. It is a story of conviction, discipline, learning and survival.
B002ZG980U|5.0|In the most annoying sense, Hollywood is losing it's originality. Sequel, prequels, remakes, comic book stories all have the popular appeal but hardly any originality or cinematic gumption. \\"Inception\\" trumps all of it. Christopher Nolan has taken filmmaking to the best possible level. I don't care that people don't like the story, that's not always the point. Nolan created a world, and in that world an alternate dimension, and put it on screen. From the story, to the directing, to the acting, to the beautiful score by Hans Zimmer, you are witnessing brilliance at it's best. There are no holes in the film unless intended to be by Nolan. It's a masterful piece of work, deserving the best accolades.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|************************************SPOILER ALERT****************************  ***DON'T READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE SEEING THE MOVIE****************************    This is a difficult movie to describe and that's a compliment to Mr. Scorsese. He's created an eerie thriller that's also a homage to Hitchcock and Kubrick and lots of other great cinematic influences as well as every excellent film noir ever made. It starts off in a surrealistic, dreamlike manner: Leo is seasick below deck on a small ship and is mightily struggling to hold his sanity together. He's a U.S. Marshall and he then meets his new partner Chuck topside, seemingly for the first time. They never met before this moment? And the backdrop seems blatantly fake - the ocean is all around them but the deck never moves. Is this Mr. Scorsese's small tribute to Hitchcock and his sometimes oddly obvious sets or is the scene a fantasy of some sort? So right away the audience is confused and unsure, and only gets more so when Chuck fumbles with his pistol and holster and seems completely unfamiliar with them. Their investigation then encounters nothing but obfuscation and denials and contradictions. The situation spirals into ever-increasing weirdness, complete with mazelike corridors and winding staircases and Leo's extremely disturbing flashbacks. What's real? Who's real? Who's crazy? Who's sane? The viewer is on unsteady ground that constantly shifts underfoot the entire time.    SI also has some of the finest acting around. The supporting cast is uniformly superb: Michelle Williams, Ben Kingsley, Max Von Sydow, Mark Ruffalo and Jackie Earle Haley as well as all the minor characters and an uncredited DeNiro cameo. It's necessarily hallucinatory because most of it takes place inside an insane man's tortured mind. Mr. Scorsese deserves a lot of credit for crafting something so original out of such derivative material and he definitely knows how to hold an audience's interest. He's also a victim of his past successes - some people seem to expect \\"Raging Bull\\" or \\"Taxi Driver\\" every time out. SI is a very creepy, disturbing movie that takes close attention to follow and features a very flawed and non-dynamic hero.     Sometimes you're in the mood for a big juicy steak and a baked potato and a few ice-cold beers and other times all you want is a bag of microwave popcorn and a can of Pepsi. This is a steak-type movie, that's all.
0425166805|2.0|Great price for a classic book. The Chariots of the Gods makes for some interesting thought, but the ideals could have been express in much less pages. The last 4 to 6 chapters is a recap of the entire book.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Finally!  A movie about Robin Hood that makes me \\"believe\\" in the old folk lore!!!  I hope there's a sequel... Russell Crowe is EXCELLENT... but, then, I don't think I've seen any of his movies where he wasn't excellent.  Great viewing for all.
0385738757|3.0|This book got 3 stars because even though I enjoyed it very much, (although not as much as Maze Runner)  I also found it unbearably frustrating.  The biggest thing to get me down was that all the characters seemed to go through all the trials from some whacko's say so, without any real motivation that I could see.  Or at least it could have been made a bit clearer.  After everything they had gone through, one would think that at some point they'd stop and refuse to be an experiment.    Sure,  they were told that they had been infected with the flash, but that the same group of people killed half their friends in book one, lied about who they were and their motives, and kidnapped one of the party.   Trustworthy?  I think not.      The only real motivation I saw was that Thomas wanted to find Theresa, and that along with the question of who WICKED really is was what got me through the book.  Was it answered? No. Will I read book 3?  Yes.  At this point I also dislike Theresa with a passion and if the author has Thomas forgive her in book 3 I will probably tear it in half and burn it.     There was also too much Thomas and not nearly enough of everyone else in the story.  I really liked Minho and Newt from the first book and hated seeing them nearly reduced to an afterthought.          DISCLAIMER: I tend to give very harsh reviews.  This doesn't mean I didn't like the book.  I won't finish a book I didn't like.  I just don't have that kind of dedication.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. I have read everything Nicholas Sparks has written and wait on pens and needles for the next book to come out. Of all the books this was my favorite. I loved it.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Within a few days of placing my order, the package arrived, in great shape and within the time allotted. When I played the movie, the flow was smooth, with excellent sound and video quality--the discs were both flawless and in top-notch condition. It was truly a pleasure ordering this product.
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|I was tipped on to these as some of the best recordings of Mozart's Piano Concertos. They are indeed brilliant performances, engaging and it feels how Mozart would like them played.     As other reviewers have mentioned, the splitting of concerti across discs is ridiculous, especially since there would easily be room for another disc in the box. However, when listening on the computer or iPod, of course you won't notice the difference.
076781214X|5.0|I agree with one of the reviews that Coppola is the best director of the past thiry - forty years.   I saw Peggy Sue when it first opened.  I didn't appreciate it then.  The musical score and the cinematography should let you know it's basically not a comedy but a meditation.  It is deep and poignant and I could watch it many times.  It may be one of the undervalued films of all time.
B002VECM4A|5.0|This movie reveals what a lot of young people really have to suffer from their own mothers.  I like the fact that Precious was able to over come.  I can identify with \\"mother abruse\\". I not only got over it, but I became a stronger person.  The first thing to do, is to get miles away from the abuser, and build a life for your self.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|It is great show and it came with 4 discs. Each disc is different and can watch is repeatably. So informative, we get new information every time. This really gives value of HD TVs.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Buzz and Woody will always be number one in our house.  this one lives up in every way!  Again!!
0143036424|5.0|I LOVED it, loved it loved it.  The characters are deep, but still colorful and interesting.  Even the supporting characters are fantastic, I especially love Vic the potty mouth deputy transplant from Philly.  Lots of action and some dark subject matter, but plenty of laugh out loud funny lines.  I laughed out loud several times over Vic's phone messages to the sheriff, her stopping for him to nod and agree or respond then going on because she knows what he will say.  I did not see the ending twist, though I guess I should have, but that made it all the better for me (some books are still great even when you guess, but I am happy when I cannot guess correctly).
B0040JHXTI|5.0|I've been seeing Bruce in concert since '74 and have seen him almost 100 times. The Dvd are great and show something of what it's like to be at a concert. The cd part has many songs that I remember hearing him do years before he would put them on an album, only by then altogether different. Candys Room and Racing In The Street are great examples of this.
0061438294|4.0|this book here shows how the 'limbic' part of the brain functions and sort out movements we usually do not catch on to in the naked eye,on top of being influential this book here has a sense of discipline,jon navarro who is an ex FBI agent,clearly states how every limbic movement is based on protecting the body, in this book you are going to learn how to keep your eyes on your own possession,which is your body--and how to keep danger away from your body--so in a way you are learning what every BODY part is saying and you are building a center of self defense--
0452286751|3.0|If you like James Bond movies, then you'll love The Fountainhead. Howard Roark can do everything. He is ALWAYS the best architect in the world. He ALWAYS has the highest taste in all matters of art. But he can do more than that. He rose from destitution. He is a master builder. He is unbelievably strong, he can seduce the most beautiful of women, he can charm tyrants, and he can give rousing speeches to get himself acquitted of a violent crime he already confessed to. He is always absolutely in the right, and has no flaw.    Of course, those damn 'second-handers' can't appreciate him. They're all just sycophantic morons though. Except for the dastardly liberals, always scheming on how to fool the masses into appreciating their own terrible art and destroy what's good in the world once and for all. That's one reason why no great artists have ever been liberals, or collaborated with each other.    Unlike Rand, I live in the real world, where artistic taste does have some degree of subjectivity to it, and it's not ok to rape a woman just because she really wanted it.    I don't know about you, but I consider any world view that decides that everyone who doesn't agree with you is either a moron or a caricature of evil bent on world domination to be a pretty adolescent one. And considering the attempts to pass off long philosophical soliloquies as dialog, and the obvious political agendas of this book, it's hard not to judge it on it's world view. We can't laud it for the depth of its characters. Rand's notes laid out the themes of her character, and she'll be damned if any of them move an inch away from those and, god forbid, develop a little. It does deserve credit for crisp, engaging storytelling.       If you don't mind narrow-minded stories with predictable characters and a predictable ending, and don't mind trudging through a philosophy allegedly based on rationalism but with more issues than Dominique Francon, then The Fountainhead is a fun read.
B000FA675C|5.0|As good as the film was, the book is even better. This is often the word on books turned to movies but I found it to finally be true. Great work of art!
B002QKZLZ6|2.0|My Plantroinics Pro boom has a high ridge on it that makes this case a tight fit.  Although a nice case, if you have the \\"Pro\\", you might want to consider something else, or position the boom diagaonaly in the case.
B000002H48|5.0|I actually attended this concert. Mainly to see Bruce. Bought it in record form, them tape, them cd and now a new one to replace my old damaged one. There are so many great songs on this album. A true classic.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Movie should never have been released.  This is not a history movie per se but another nauseating love triangle movie.  Use of the Queen Mary and USS Missouri as scene backdrops totally inaccurate as one they are instantly recognizeable as their profiles are unmistakeable and neither type ship was anywhere near Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.  All in all, a total waste of 3 hours.
B0042UD51A|5.0|My first thought was wondering why they didn't use the same pianist for both concerti. But I enjoyed these so much, then I wondered what the results would have been swapping the two combos.    This is a lovely disc. Playing, orchestral contibution and conducting are all beyond reproach. Demidenko is the introspective one with Kissin being the flashier. I really liked the #1. Demidenko is poetic, playful, and treats each note individually. This is a longer concerto than #2 (40min. vs. 24), but it never lags.    Kissin's approach to the #2 (actually written before #1) is more fiery and he exudes much more exhibitionism - good for a concert, perhaps less so over repeated listening. I'll find out, because this is a disc to be played often. The encores are all well done.    The camera work is excellent, not at all intrusive, excellent color balance and saturation ( played on blueray upconverted to 1080p). The sound is likewise about perfect (I used dts, all channels equally balanced)
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This book was just as great of a read as the first two in the series. Brown continues to amaze and inspire further historical learning. My only hope is that this does not conlude the series and follows its predecessors into film.
B00447G2T8|1.0|I really don´t know if I´m getting older or if the new helloween album is really bad. I see the major numbers of reviews are good. So after try to listen the album about ten times, I give up. So I put Master of the rings in my cd player and realize: I still like heavy music: Sole Survivor, Where the rain grows, Why?, Perfect Gentleman, Secret Alibi, In the middle of a heartbeat. I didn´t listen to them for a while. But how they sound so fresh to my ears in comparison with the horribles Are you metal (it makes my ears ache), Who´s Mr. Madman and You stupid mankind. I like alot the albums Chameleon, Rabbit don´t come easy, Keepers 3 and Gambling with the devil. But I´m sorry to say that this album isn´t good for the older fans, maybe for the newer ones. The heavy sound without melody, for me, is only noise.
B0037KMHRY|1.0|I love daft punk and the clips I've heard in reviews sound amazing.    Unfortunately I'm incapable of listening to the CD because it uses a black CD-R and nothing in my house will read it (I have all macs and a super old CD player).    As a designer I can respect the disc visual aesthetic, but seriously, do some research into usability before making a decision like this! A *lot* of players of issues with black backed discs.
1401228801|5.0|Since I usually catch up with the adventures of our beloved Fables when the individual issues are collected into volumes, when I got this in the mail today (literally about an hour prior to writing this review) I immediately sat down to read it. After all, important stuff happens in this volume.<br /><br />Where to begin? First we've got the problem of Mister Dark, the embodiment of everything you are & should be afraid of. He's preparing himself for something sinister, something that will undoubtedly effect not only the fables but mankind in general. If that's not bad enough, the tensions on the Farm are rising. Totenkinder has run the witches of the 13th floor for years, but now she's got competition for her leadership in the form of Ozma. Things aren't going all that well for Bufkin either- he's trapped in the remnants of Fabletown's office with a whole host of newly released monsters- including a powerful djinn & a very, VERY mad Baba Yaga. Meanwhile in Flycatcher's kingdom there's trouble as well. A drunk goblin has eaten one of the other citizens of the kingdom. The other goblins are threatening to revolt if the offender is put to death, but pardoning the gob's crimes might be just as bad.<br /><br />This volume is awesome. Not only does it have the reappearance of several people and items mentioned in past volumes, but the artwork is as stunning as is par for the course in this series. Oh, and you get to see how Bufkin reacts in an emergency situation. It doesn't get much better than that. (Until the next volume, anyway.) Also cool is that this volume draws upon the whole Rose Red situation, emphasizing the showdown between good & evil that's undoubtedly coming in the next volume.<br /><br />If you've been collecting the series so far, you absolutely cannot miss out on this volume. I have to admit, I was a little suspicious about what would happen after the fall of the Empire, but this current story is awesome & is a nice change after the previous Jack-centric volume.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I LOVE this cd. All of the songs are just amazing. I turn it on my I pod and just let it play. Its one of few cds that I will listen to all of the songs without skipping thru. Just wonderful. Buy it.
0307454541|1.0|I just don't understand what so many people liked about this book. It was very long and drawn out. I didn't need to know the family history dating back to the 1600's. Everyone kept telling me I had to really concentrate and read a bit more to get into it. After 200 pages it was still boring and the little bit of drama in the next 300 pages or so didn't make up for it. I finished the book only because I was in a book club and wanted to be able to discuss it and funny thing is everyone in my book club hated it too. We won't be reading book 2 or 3. I have better things to do with my time.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Spartacus is a tale of love and the pain a man suffers from losing his freedom and the woman he loves only to be forged in the Roman arena as a Gladiator put there by the Roman officer who took his life and the woman he loved Spartacus is a tale of Cunning,Lust,and of course Sexuality,done over the top that will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more filled with bloody violence through the complete first season and top notch special effects a must see for Men and Woman but this drama is not for the prying eye's of children past there bed-time.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Got this DVD set at such a great price! Love Modern Family! One of the best shows on tv now!
0307454541|4.0|I Liked it,but i didn't love it like i thought i was going to.  With all the hype i must have missed something. Iam reading the 2nd book,but that isn't going much better. The mystery of the Vanger family was very interesting, but then it continued and was a letdown.  I hope this one goes better. What was it that made these books so great, I feel like iam missing something what is it ????
B0044IJ1S6|5.0|They cancelled the San Diego show and never came back this tour. So mad I stopped listening to SOTU. Than I saw this Concert DVD and in love and all forgiven. They sound and look great together. MUST in Blue Ray.
B002ZG974M|5.0|I can watch this gem of a film again and again and again--beautifully done and precious.  We need more of this type of film-making which \\"speaks\\" universally and has contrast, humor and is all about life.  Lovely background music.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I have not always been the biggest Kid Rock fan, but this album blew me away. It was not like his former music, so be prepared for a change.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this CD. It shows a \\"soft side\\" to Kid, like when he sings \\"Picture\\" with Sheryl Crow.  Since the day I bought it (the day it was released) I have listened to it every day. I love it!!  I can now say I AM A KID ROCK FAN!!!
0525421033|5.0|I loved this book!  I was able to connect with the main character and empathize deeply with her emotions.  I can not wait for the sequel in April of 2011!!!
B002ZG981E|5.0|I have not gone to a theater to see a movie more than one since the original Star Wars.  No need to anymore with DVD.  But Inception's elegance and adrenaline on the big screen was too alluring to resist. By the third time, I had picked up on so many little things that I missed originally.  The ensemble cast was perfect.  IMO, they could have cut the special effects budget in half (or more) and it still would have been and excellent story. If someone says they didn't \\"get it\\", it's not the film maker's fault.
B004132HZS|5.0|I can't quite express how cool this series is! The actors are amazing, and the quirkiness of Holmes' is absolutely endearing.  I can't wait for more episodes to come to US television.
0439023513|1.0|This is the first book review I've ever written. I hope I can stop someone from wasting their time and money on this book. I enjoyed the first two books of the Hunger Games series and was looking forward to the third. This is the silliest piece of fiction I've ever read. I find myself hoping someone will shot Katniss just to shut her up. This book reads like something the author threw together to meet her obligation to the publisher.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|After suffering through both the abysmally impotent AVP and the mediocre AVP: REQUIUM, I was expecting yet another stinking pile of toxic waste. I am ecstatic to report that PREDATORS is not only NOT an embarrassment, it is a fantastic follow-up to the original, and better than PREDATOR 2! Adrien Brody (SPLICE, OXYGEN, THE JACKET, etc.) does an excellent job as the mercenary leader of a group of professional killers. His Arnold-redux is well played, w/ just enough grit and (low-key) humour. Alice Braga's character is basically a good cross between Michelle Rodriguez in RESIDENT EVIL 1 and Vasques from ALIENS. Topher Grace is surprisingly watchable, since I only remembered him from THAT 70s SHOW, and rolled my eyes and groaned when first reading of his appearance. Laurence Fishburne (THE MATRIX 1-3, EVENT HORIZON) makes a nice cameo, but could have been in it a bit longer. As for the PREDATORS themselves, they are just as intimidating, imposing, and lethal as ever! These are savage, stealthy hunters, without the wimpiness of AVP or the sloppiness of REQUIUM. Highly recommended...
B0035WTE2U|5.0|This item was in great condition and arrived in a short amount of time.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I rented Season One because I had never seen the show and didn't know anything about it. By the second episode I was hooked. I can't say enough about the acting, the choreography and the songs. Being somewhat familiar with production schedules, I am completely perplexed as to how they shoot these for once a week airings and maintain such quality. Each of these episodes is like watching musical feature film.  The cast are a group of very multi-talented people.    From a technical perspective, the Blu-Ray discs include a Jukebox of all the routines for continuous play if you like in shuffle mode or by episode. One important fact is that this Blu-Ray implementation allows stop and restart from last position on the discs unlike many BD's.
B003FSTN7A|5.0|Allison (Patricia Arquette) and company do not disappoint. Initially, I was going to ask for this for Christmas, but found I could not wait! I have all the seasons and enjoy watching them over and over. A very special thank you to CBS for picking up this great show, hope to own many more seasons!
B0037KMHRY|2.0|This sound track *does not* have the full version (4:11) of Derezzed. It only has 1:44 of the song edited for the movie score. If you looking for a Daft Punk \\"expereince.\\" This is not it. It a good Soundtrack. But that's all it is.
B003TVMIDO|3.0|I LOVE JOHN LENNON AND ALL HIS MUSIC. THIS IS QUITE A CHUNK OF MONEY FOR HIS MUSIC. I THOUGHT WOW, EVERYTHING IN A NEAT LITTLE PACKAGE. I COULD HAVE A JOHN LENNON ALL DAY MUSIC FEST. GUESS WHAT?  I FOUND EVERY OTHER ONE WAS YOKO. THE WOMAN I SUPPOSE HAS HER OWN STYLE AND TALENT BUT NOT TACKED-ON WITH JOHN LENNON. IF YOU ARE PREPARED TO BUY JOHN AND YOKO MUSIC THEN THIS IS A GREAT DEAL. IF YOU WANT ONLY JOHN LENNON I SUGGEST YOU BUY ALL HIS ALBUMS ONE AT A TIME. I WISH SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME BEFORE I INVESTED IN THIS   \\"SIGNATURE BOX\\".
B0012ZQ3OE|5.0|The movie was a used movie rated very good condition....which was in my opinion as good as new.  The price was right!!!  The service was outstanding.  I would recommend the seller with no reservations.  Merry Christmas to all.
0671027573|2.0|This is my first book by Linda Howard.  Someone had recommended it on the romance forums here on Amazon.  I don't usually read contemporaries or romantic suspense so that might be coloring my view.  The blurb is above and others have done a good job summarizing so onto my review.    I don't know whether it was the author's writing style or just the wording, but I kept thinking this book was written in the 80's or early 90's at the latest despite all the references to cell phones, computers, and a Dodge Viper, etc.    I completely agree with other reviewers that the idea of this List getting that much attention is stupid and ridiculous.  Until you got to the size requirements nothing was even out of the ordinary of expectations.  After Jaine's \\"leftover\\" comment even the author doesn't expound on the shocking items listed, but seems to hint to more such items or comments the reader never learns of.      I didn't like Jaine Bright. She really wasn't very bright. She came off to me with her attitude and cursing to be what I see as \\"trailer trash\\".  As someone else said she was awfully judgmental.  I didn't really see why these four ladies became friends other than working at the same business, not even in the same department either.  I hated that she was in full hate mode to Sam until she sees him naked and that changes her 180 degrees to instant lust.      I did like Sam Donovan, our hero.  He was responsible, sexy, the type of man you can lean on in a moment of crisis.  One thing I can't reconcile though is Jaine's initial description of him to who he turns out to be(drunk/drug dealer=cop).  Unless he was working undercover, even cops have a dress code.    ********MAY BE SPOILERS BELOW!! READ AT YOUR OWN RISK********    Jaine and Sam's relationship was completely unbelievable.  She having 3 failed engagements and him being divorced decide to get married after 1 bout of sex.....can we say divorce.  They went from hate to love in supposedly 2 weeks.  They had maybe 5 conversations before the above mentioned sex.      How stupid was TJ?  I think that may have been my most hated part of this whole story.  She seemed to be so smart and still did the dumbest move of the whole book.    Just a personal grievance-I am not a car aficionado and while I like to learn new things while I read, I was rather at a loss with the car references.  I know Detroit is the Motor City.  I think Linda Howard went overboard on exactly how many people care about what car you drive and the upkeep of said car.  I am too young and therefore have no idea what a 1964 Cobra looked like until I looked it up online.   ********END SPOILER********  All in all this book hasn't put me off Linda Howard for ever, however it also hasn't given me the inspiration to hunt out any other of her titles any time soon.
B000NDI3SK|4.0|This remastered series of the seventies holds up surprisingly well some forty years on! Jacob Bronowski is superb in his thoughtful speculations and analysis of a broad spectrum of cutting edge science, its history and development, and the constant interplay between the science and technology.<br /><br />Some aspects of the science have moved on in the intervening years, but for anyone with an interest in the subject, and looking for lucid explanations and insight, like Carl Sagan's 'Cosmos', this series is both enjoyable and informative.
B002ZG981E|5.0|As far as movies go for 2010, this is a top contender for best picture.  I think this movie will challenge other filmmakers to strive to give the audiences good quality films along with great stories.  People want to be entertained and this movie certainly does the job.  As far as combo packs goes, this is amazing because it has a whole disc of special features so there is always something new.  The amazing thing is that you can analyze these behind the scenes and find something new overtime.<br /><br />I would say that my only issue is that the DVD print looks cooler than the Blu ray, Other than that, it's amazing.
0525423273|5.0|My Thoughts: As most of you know who follow my blog I have been wanting this book so bad!!!! So when it came as a surprise, I started jumping up and down yelling Yes, Yes, Yes! I read it the night I got it until late, than got up the next morning to finish it. I had a migrane so bad from not getting much sleep the next morning but it was worth every single second! My boyfriend wanted to turn off the bedroom light and I kept begging for 10 more minutes, 10 more minutes please! I didn't want to stop! Stephanie Perkins, how did you manage to make me fall in love with this book the way you did? I mean, I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think anything except how wonderful Anna is and how now I must go to Paris! I've always wanted to go to Paris but now I must go there! HEHE!<br /><br />I'm going to start off this review and just break down all the elements of the story I liked. I don't want to give away major spoilers but I must talk about this book! I could talk and talk and talk and talk forever! Nothing I could say will describe how much I loved this book.<br /><br />First off, we start off getting to know a little bit about Anna Oliphant. Her father is a published author, her brother Sean is allergic to red dye #40 (I thought I was the only one) her mom seems nice enough, and she is starting her senior year in a foreign country (nope not at Clairemont High as planned). She has friends at Clairemont named Bridgette (her best friend), Matt (her ex-boyfriend aka friend) and of course Toph (her soon to be boyfriend aka co-worker). She is going to miss prom, miss senior year classes, miss senior year activities, ARRGG!<br /><br />Her father sends her away to a new school, a new city, a new life. Her first night in Paris and she meets new friends. Meredith, who is her neighbor and the cute guy she bumps into in the hallway just outside Meredith's room. Who is he? Etienne St Clair!! He has dark brown messy hair, he's short, brown eyes, beautiful, and English. Of course as soon as they lay eyes on one another, the chemistry is there. The next day she gets introduced to the other people of the group, Rashmi and Josh. There were so many characters throughout the book and I loved them all. Well, except for Ellie (St Clair's girlfriend). Of course I wanted her out of the picture from day one! All the characters were great and each had their own personality and brought a lot to the book. Anna was constantly around them so it made for a lot of laughs, deep conversations, etc.<br /><br />Anna also loved movies. She loved reviewing them. I love movies so I can understand how seeing old classics on the screen for her was like a dream come true. Anna was such a sweet character. She was nice, she was easy to get along with, I just felt like she became my friend while reading the book.<br /><br />The scenery in the book was beautiful. Perkins did such a great job describing everything I actually felt like I was in Paris. I could see the people walking around, I could taste the coffee, I could just feel the foreign presence of everything.<br /><br />The emotional aspect of the book made me want to cry for St Clair. His mom gets sick, and its so hard on him. He's such a tough guy most of the time that I just wanted to hold his hand and let him cry in my lap. Sorry Anna, but if he comes knocking at my door I will answer! (LOL).<br /><br />Some of the scenes, okay most of the scenes were so freaking amazing. When he scoots his boot over to grab the nasty note about Anna before the teacher does, when they go see movies together, when he turns around and packs her clothes while she changes, and he glances up and their eyes meet in the mirror (oops). Every scene was amazing! I even loved how he was afraid of heights and he was short! Most of the time I forgot he was short, he had so much confidence about him that he just came off as such a great wonderful guy. St Clair and Anna make the perfect pair; best friends/movie watchers/sleep mates/lovers. Andgirl scout cookies, oh my! Thin mints are my favorite and I loved how Perkins included this scene! She put everything I want in a book in her book! She is an amazing debut author!!!<br /><br />Next, I want to talk about Anna and St Clair. The romantic tension was so hot I felt like I was going to pass out. There were moments I laughed, but mostly there were moments I was in love. I usually stay away from the sex aspects in book reviews because I feel like once a character jumps into bed with another character, I start to get bored. I want to see sexual chemistry where the characters don't fall into bed with each other right away. I want to see them fall in love with each other. I want to see their love grow before anything happens. Does that make sense? Well, Perkins does this in exactly the way I want and it blew me totally away. St Claire is amazing. The way he comes to her rescue with Dave, the way he runs to Ellie after the night of the kiss, the way he paces across his room floor. How can you not fall in love with this guy? Even while Anna went home for a few weeks, and St Clair was in California and their only communication was emails/phone conversations I still fell more in love with him.<br /><br />The chemistry and tension between Anna and St Clair is not only hot but sexy,interesting, charming, and just freaking awesome! The way they steal glances at one another, the way they talk, the way she notices his bottom teeth and how they are a bit crooked (HOT), the way he calls her beautiful, the way they dance together on the dance floor, his accent,the way when he finally kisses her I had a big grin on my face!<br /><br />I can't say much more about Anna And The French Kiss that won't be said a million times by fans. Anna is amazing. Anna is a book you do not want to miss. If you read one book this whole entire year, please let it be Anna!!!!<br /><br />Sneak Peak-DO NOT READ THIS if you don't want a sneak peak into the bed scene. Why are you still reading? LOL Snippets of the bed scene: He stops before me, scanning my face. \\"Would it be okay if I stayed with you? I don't want to make you uncomfortable-\\" \\"No! I mean... My head swims. I can hardly think straight. \\"Yes, Yes, of course, it's okay.\\"<br /><br />Overall: Was Anna as amazing as I had hoped for? Oui! This review is long! I could write 10 more paragraphs about it though! HAHA! I read a lot of books (as most of you know) and I'm introduced to a lot of good books but Anna And The French Kiss had that sort of element that Jennifer Echols Forget You had. If you've read my review for that, you know how much I loved that book. It's been a while since I've fallen so completely in love with a book and Perkins brought me back to that feeling. That feeling where I wish the book was real life and I was the main character! Anna was a dream come true! Perkins took everything I wished someone would write and made it a reality for me. Merci beaucoup.<br /><br />Cover: Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! I love every little detail about the cover!<br /><br />What I'd Give It: 5/5 Cupcakes<br /><br />Taken from Princess Bookied I loved how Perkins included this scene!

B002ZTIIXK|3.0|If one is a fan of k.d. lang's this release should be a great point of departure for he/she who does not have all of lang's releases; however this 2 CD release is missing at least 2 dozen must haves which could have easily fit in the CD's.<br /><br />The only upside to this collection for the true fan who has not gotten his hands on songs of k.d.'s which have been included in other compilations or movie soundtracks.<br /><br />I am a huge fan, but this release makes little sense. Missing too much thus leaving any potential purchaser underfed. For those who don't have any of k.d's releases I'd start with her pop breakthrough \\"Ingenue\\" and/or any of her early country-shattering CD's.<br /><br />Also, the inserts are poor. Nothing new to add regarding any of the songs. Just a cursory list indicating from what releease the each song is from. I don't know if k.d. have any involvement with this project. I am hoping not as it feels like an attempt to cash in on fans.
1439177783|1.0|I think my expectations were too high. It was more about the journey of the weight loss than the recovery. In the interviews I saw which is why I bought it, she spoke of her healing, and how she learned to like herself. To me that didn't come across
B003KGBISY|5.0|Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is one of the greatest movies of all time, but I was a little skeptical at first about buying this blu-ray. I already had the DVD and how good could a 60+ year old B&W film really look on blu-ray? But man was I surprised!<br /><br />The film looks amazing. When I started watching the movie, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Everything was so crisp and clear. Some of the movie doesn't look as good as the other parts, but believe that is because a better version of that section of the movie no longer exists.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying more old B&W movies on blu-ray in the future especially the ones from the Criterion Collection. They really do a phenomenal job.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My grandaughter is just in love with Ponyo.  It is the best movie I have gotten for her.  Even better than Toy Story!
B003UESJJC|5.0|Apocalypse Now has been a favorite of mine for years.  I've loved both the original theatrical cut, as well as the redux version.  I've also always wanted the companion documentary \\"hearts of darkness\\".  Well, now I have all 3 on crystal clear blu ray.  The new high-def video transfer of the films were done with great care, and it feels like your watching a movie that just came out, rather than in the 1970's. The sound is fantastic with the HD-quality of Walter Murches first surround sound of helicopters whirring all around you. There are also a whole bunch of special features scattered throughout the 3 discs.  Some are new, including a great sit-down HD-interview between Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Sheen.  They just casually chat about making the movie, and look back 30 years together.  The commentary is great too (all 3 films have it). This is truly a must-have for any film fanatic.  It is worth every penny.  I can only hope that more films are released on Blu Ray in this manner.
030726999X|4.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy, although I found the parts involving Mikael and his magazine to be less interesting than the parts involving Lizbeth.
B003L77GHE|5.0|I heard this show was for teeny boppers but took a chance and purchased season 1  I am a recently retired Marine and after watching the first 5 minutes I was hooked!  This show has drama,action,and great acting! This series is for adults and kids.  Can't wait for season 2 to be released!
0446195529|4.0|The theory of this page turner is that nothing is what it seems to be.  The concept is what drives this exciting book.  I enjoyed it while I was reading and each turn was interesting,  Stone continues to unravel this mystery and does a good job.    There are several problems with this  book.  First, it does not develop the Camel Club as well as others in the series.  Also when one thinks about the book it really does not make any sense.   That does not detract from the enjoyment.  Just do not try to analyze it carefully
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Avatar was one of the best movies I have seen with Sam Worthington, not the best James Cameron film, I still love Titanic, but love this movie and the Music, don't get me started on that, it is wonderful.
B000JSI7BM|5.0|I love this movie and both actresses.  I got it because I like to watch it all the time.
B000Y7U98W|1.0|This Blu-ray disc does not work with the PS3, which I would have known if I'd read these reviews. It's awful, unwatchable. Wish Amazon would make a note of it somewhere prominent. Unbelievable!
B0040JHXTI|5.0|I purchased this for my husband as a Christmas gift. Its beautifully put together and the selection of songs is perfection!! I love the fact that it comes w/ unseen footage on 3 dvds. Great price , great set. Love it!!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is one awesome series. You can expect more from those zombies in this series. I watched this every sunday and it goten better. I will buy this.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Definitively among the best films of 2010. An original script and quite a master work of creativity by the film writer and director Christopher Nolan. At the beginning you might find some resemblance with [[ASIN:B001NXBRJG The Matrix]] regarding what the perception of the real world is, or with [[ASIN:B000HIVOIM Total Recall]] regarding implanting memories, but Mr. Nolan manages to develop a one of a kind original and interesting story, with full action, spectacular SFX, you name it. No need to go into details, there are plenty in the other reviews, but do not let them spoil it, just watch it.<br /><br />Without any doubt this movie is a delight for fans of hard core science fiction, you might mistakenly think Philip K. Dick wrote the story. Because the plot unfolds like a flawless chess game played by two masters, following up the plot and digesting all the information is difficult, so this is a movie you might need to watch two o three times to fully grasp all the details.<br /><br />Amazon discounted launch price is quite a bargain, for just $17.99 you get the Blu-ray disc, the DVD and a digital copy you can play on your favorite mobile device. Nevertheless, watching the Blue-ray on a flat screen is quite an experience, so it is not worthy to save a couple of bucks for the DVD only version. Highly recommended and let's hope there is a sequel of the same quality (the ending leaves the door wide open!), just like the Matrix trilogy
B004259BMM|5.0|I have been a huge Keith Urban fan for years!! Every album he releases is great, but I think this album is one of his best yet! Every single song on here is has amazing lyrics and music. It fills you with so much emotion, and each song always brings a smile to my face whenever I listen to it. He has a great mixture of slow and fast songs. His song \\"Without You\\" is a tribute to his life with Nicole and Sunday Rose.  It brings tears to my eyes everytime I listen to it- one of my favorites on the album. They are all such touching songs; you can feel his emotions while listening. I feel like anyone who listens to this album has a deeper understanding to who Keith Urban really is.  I would also buy the Target edition. You receive three additional new songs, plus four live songs which are great because you can hear how much he rocks out at his concerts.  I listen to that album multiple times a week; I can't get enough of it.  You will not be disappointed. Great job Keith! Keep making music just like this!!    You sure do \\"Get Closer\\" with Keith on this album!
0345505387|1.0|I love the Outlander series and have even reread the books she has put out. Were I to be new to her stories and read \\"The Exile\\" first, I would be lost and clueless as to what kind of story I was reading. I was lost and felt the graphics to be an insult to the characters she so beautifully portrays. I still love you Diana but this book is not worth buying. Save your money for the first of her series \\"Outlander\\", and walk into a world of romance, time travel and historical figures, you will be glad you did.[[ASIN:0385319959 Outlander]]
0451228375|2.0|...Was my reaction to almost every conflict within this book. Just when things were getting normal, our protagonist was getting ahead, one of the standard bad guys shows up at the perfect time. \\"Oh no, Philemon again, Oh no Ralph again, oh no Godwin again.\\"    Hey, let's let one \\"run away\\" and then randomly show up when I need conflict. Over, and over, and over again.    Then the cliche \\"Luke, I am your father\\" Star Wars (et al) ending was just too much.     Let's start a plague and kill off extra characters to continue the story!
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Although I used standard shipping, I received this item is record time: two days before the estimated delivery date, and two days after I placed the order!  Item was also in condition as advertised.  I'm VERY pleased. Thank you!
B00168OIOE|5.0|Really, Pixar cannot go wrong. This movie is great. I love that they re-released it on Blu-Ray. It looks way better! This movie is good for kids as well as adults!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Although hard to read at first, I thought the book was great.   You quickly get used to the language of a 5 year old.
0767020308|5.0|Although I used standard shipping, I received this item is record time: two days before the estimated delivery date, and two days after I placed the order!  Item was also in condition as advertised.  I'm VERY pleased. Thank you!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I get a little annoyed at people that compare a single film to a almost institutional film like Pixar's Toy story,(and I love Toy Story 1,2,&3) but its also unfair. Your comparing 15 years of history that has had time to grow and mature, against a film that has just come out. I love Despicable Me for it's mold breaking story of Villain Vs. Villain, Youth Vs. Mature and it's over the top portrayal of the characters. In a world where there appear to be no super heros, and Villains go to banks to get loans for their scams, and the gags are there for both children and adults. I give it 10 out of ten for its newness, the same as How to Train Your Dragon another film with a refreshing spark of humour .
B002M9WW30|5.0|Rocky series are my all time favorite inspirational movies. I have some on tape, and pretty much all on DVD (bought individually over the years).    There are some long reviews that I gone through here - many are good writeups. But at the end of the day, I pretty much decided on two simple factors: 1) Overall it will be better than before with newest movie getting the maximum resolution, and earlier film get best restored content, and 2) I'm a huge Rocky fan and I will collect it in latest format.    If you are reading the reviews, then you are probably a lot like me. Simple and no-brainer when price is affordable / reasonable.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|This is one of the most solid albums top-to-bottom that I've heard in a long time. The songs are so powerful on their own that it took me a few listens before I noticed that there are almost no drums on this album - just some kick drum during a few choruses and a full kit on one or two tracks. Very fresh to hear an album getting airplay that doesn't fit into the usual molds of radio rock.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Blu-ray: The pictures are clean and detailed, and the sound and the singing voices are perfect. DVD: very very good.    This package is great as a gift for recipients with blu-ray or just DVD. Or both.  Giving to DVD owners will help him/her get a head start on blu-ray collection when s/he buys a blu-ray player in the future. The special features are on blu-ray only unfortunately.
B002ZG98PA|5.0|I saw this movie last Tuesday, I was a little skeptical at first because before this one, I have been deeply disapointed with the Disney animated features of the 2000's I loved the disney movies of the 90's disney's animated features in the 2000's were very disapointing. Allthough I did like Brother Bear, but the thing I loved most about it, was having the characters sing again.    That's what made me fall in love with disney movies, is when the characters actually sing instead of just a background singer singing all the songs.    The love song \\"I See The Light\\" has become my brand new favorite disney song. I've listened to the song \\"I see The Light\\" on my soundtrack so many times thank God I have it on my I-pod or the cd might be scratched by now at that point. LOL. The song was beautiful, and the scene was beautiful, and just as I remember Mandy Moore sang like an angel, and as usual Alen Menken was awesome with the music! I really liked how Mother Gothel wasn't the typical wicked step-mother that has been in past Disney movies, she's the best Disney villain since Frollo, allthough Hades was pretty good but mostly funny, but Mother Gothel is the best disney villian since Frollo he was one evil dude, and instead of the hero being a prince or a soilder, he was a scoundral, which give me a little reminder of Star Wars, (Han Solo) but they showed that Repunzel can hold her own and that she's not a typical Damsel in distress and doesn't need a prince and/or a man to save her. I loved all the frying pan hitting. That was funny, and Maxumus was funny to.    It was so heartbreaking when the King and Queen were mourning the lost of there daughter especially when the king became teary eyed, that was such a touching scene. I was surprised by how well Zachery Levi could sing, he's really good and they drew Flynn/Eugene just like Zachery I notticed in a way.    When I was watching this it brought me back to the memory of Lion King, Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin, Little Mermaid, Pochontas, Hunchback of Notre Dame, and I love how Repunzel and Flynn/Eugene didn't like each other in the least at the beginning it reminded me of Anastasia with Anya and Dimitri. I'm defently going to see this movie more, and I'm defenently going to buy it when it comes out on DVD.    ~Hannah
B004EDH4OY|2.0|What is Duffy doing with her voice?  On Rockferry, for the most part, she sings beautifully.  But I'd hate to hear Warwick Avenue in the style of this album.  \\"More warble!\\", cried her producer.  Ugh.  She sounds like a cartoon character on this album.
159448385X|5.0|When I read Hosseini's The Kite Runner, I was aborbed fully in the story feeling like I was living there myself - yet so saddened by a life that many of us here in the U.S. can only imagine.  I was looking forward to his second book, A Thousand Splendid Suns, when it was recommended to me - no knowing that I would feel that this story was even more powerful than his first.  It's a must read for anyone and I've since bought copies to share with people for holiday giving.  A wonderful story, a very sad story, a story that makes you ponder over and over again the culture differences among us and how simple lives should not be this complex.  One of my favorite books this year!
0887307280|1.0|The basic theme of this book is that you should run a business as a fool proof \\"system\\" to get the \\"thing\\" (ie whatever it is you do) done just right and exactly the same each time it's done. You can then franchise your little business and die happy and/or rich.  I wish it were more but it's not.  If your idea of a good business is one in which employees are expendable cogs relegated to following a written script (a model that's failing left and right by the way) - then this book is for you. If you want to start or run a business in which you are involved with and care for your community (employees and customers) then I would suggest that you look elsewhere - maybe Seth Godin or others.  But then again I'm just a small business owner.  Maybe the guru knows more than me.
4770030088|4.0|This is a nice textbook used very widely, but the contexts are very focused on business.  If contexts are more mixed, it would also be a good textbook even for high school students.

B003ZSH606|2.0|I saw these guys (this guy, really, this is no \\"band\\" and never was, just a bunch of hired hands soon to be fired) on their first tour in 1993, so I'm hardly new to the master of the frozen nose, Jay Kay. In fact, the second tour (and others since) saw him canceling shows left and right due to \\"personal problems\\" that turned out to be a huge blow addiction, which from the lyrics here is still well in place. From the title (what exactly do you think \\"rock dust\\" is, anyhow, and why do rock stars do so much of it?) to various other references, JK seems to think Peru gives him magical powers.<br /><br />But what it gives him here is yet another set of floppy, barely funky disco-pop tracks that are to James Brown and Sly what Thunderbird is to Dom Perignon. The production is flat, the songs barely distinguishable, the choruses forgettable and the grooves in general uninspired and boring.<br /><br />Anybody who really thinks this is Funk might want to hear the JB's circa 1971, or early Prince, or Sly's first few records. That's real funk, and this is quasi-disco. Not one track here made me want to hear it again, though I listened to all of them 3 times just to be sure it was all really as useless as it first seemed. It was. Compared to his first few albums, this is just a joke.<br /><br />But hey, if you're the type of fawning fanboy who worships every little noise this egomaniac puts out, you might like this. Yet if you've ever heard The Meters or any other real funk band, you'll laugh at this pastiche of lukewarm grooves that never once really swings hard. BlowBoy was great in '92 but he's done nothing but go downhill since then, while canceling gigs and otherwise treating fans like a used kleenex. Take away his hats and the straw up his schnoz and Jay Kay is just another used-to-be-good singer who's surfing on image and spending all the money fans give him on white powders.<br /><br />If that seems harsh, ask yourself this: why can't the guy ever keep a band together?<br /><br />This band sounds like they know they'll be fired in a month and just want to get their share of the blow in the meantime. I'll stick with real bands and \\"stars\\" who care about their fans, thanks.br /><br />This band sounds like they know they'll be fired in a month and just want to get their share of the blow in the meantime.

1593272790|5.0|A few years ago I downloaded a free pdf version of these books and sent in a donation.  I'm glad to see them in print and I quickly snatched up the collection (very reasonably priced too!).    If you've been into Legos for a number of years, especially in NXT robotics or the more advanced technics sets you might be staring at pile of weird Lego parts, gears, pins, cams and beams and wonder what can I do with all of this?  Or you might be on a First Lego League team and be wondering how to get your Legos to do a certain thing like grab something or lift something.    These beautiful books provide a treasure trove of examples of how the more advanced Lego pieces work together. Overall the Lego systems has zillions of parts available but often it seems to the Lego fan that only select engineers at Lego can actually understand what the purpose of certain parts.  By studying the photos in this book one can come to some head slapping moments like \\"ohhh, that's a way to make a gear change direction\\".    Of course the drawback of buying any third party book as opposed to buying a Lego kit is that of course you most likely won't have all of the pieces depicted in the book.  But since the Lego system is so diverse you should be able to recreate what is shown in a different way or search Ebay or online Lego brick sellers for the piece you need.    The educational applications of this series of books is vast.  It takes one into the realm of simply machines and engineering.  Its a great resource or encyclopedia for anyone doing Lego robotics or First Lego League.    Thank you Yoshihito for sharing your Lego knowledge and your art!

Once all the time slips etc are clear, there are plenty of other ideas that become lucid and I realize how much serious thought Nolan put into this concept, and how well executed it is. Like Fight Club, only with multiple viewings does the whole story emerge. And for Nolan to have written and directed this, well, massive respect for that level of vision.]<br /><br />I love the ideas here but Nolan could have tightened it all up a bit more. There are all sorts of conceptual loose ends that a little bit more exposition would have dealt with. The way the love interest is integral yet somehow forced grated now and then, and sometimes it all felt like Nolan was so caught up in his own dream world of this movie that he could have used a \\"kick\\" or two himself to realize that shorter is sweeter.<br /><br />Buuuut, once I gave up expecting more cohesion and just flowed with it, warts and all, there were plenty of good concepts and CGI eye candy to keep the brain amused, and all in all it was an enjoyable viewing, especially with the fine BD picture quality. The dynamic range is as usual these days a little too much...you can barely hear them talk and then BOOM! Your walls are shaking as a train crashes into the room. But I guess the goal is visceral jolting and that is indeed accomplished.<br /><br />DiCaprio is solid but never stunning, ditto the rest of the cast. I can't remember one moment where I thought, \\"That's some fine acting\\", nor did I ever think it was bad. It just was, and the focus is so squarely on the dreams-in-dreams that the relationships never really gel. But once again, this is a thrill ride, so asking more might be pointless.<br /><br />I was on occasion reminded of Paprika, and if you like this make sure to see that, clearly an inspiration for Nolan and a truly great movie.<br /><br />[Edit again: One very real highlight here is Zimmer's score, which is haunting and compelling and altogether memorable. I picked up his Inception OST last year and really like it late at night driving on empty roads. The simple two note themes have a lot of power, proving that harmonic context can deeply shape any melody when put in stark relief by the simplicity of that melody. Which fits in perfectly with Nolan's overriding philosophical concept here. Now that's top notch film scoring. The more I watch this the more I love that score and see how tightly integrated it is to Nolan's ideas. Zimmer is not only insanely prolific but a genius when at his best, like here and the Dark Knight and so many others.]<br /><br />Worth seeing for those who like psychological thrillers, crisp effects, and considering exactly what is it that makes reality real, and not.is Zimmer's score, which is haunting and compelling and altogether memorable.

0345509617|5.0|My husband- a closet Stay Wars junkie- has been eying this book for several weeks.  I finally broke down and ordered for him- and can't wait for him to open it Christmas morning!  I flipped through the book- and found some very interesting facts and pretty cool illustrations.
0553805371|3.0|Stephen Hawking is one of the world's most brilliant and acclaimed scientists. I loved his previous book \\"A Brief History of Time\\" in which he talked about black holes, inflation, quantum mechanics and general relativity. He was on much firmer ground there, discussing concrete things which could more or less be experimentally investigated and verified.<br /><br />But in this book he mainly deals with fanciful speculation about the much-exalted 'theory of everything'. In Hawking and Mlodinow's opinion, the best candidate for this theory is 'M-theory', an extension of string theory which promises to unify all the forces and explain 'everything'. But this is far from being a convincing argument. Firstly, there have been many recent critiques of string theory (for instance in the books by Lee Smolin and Peter Woit) which detail the almost complete lack of experimental prediction on the part of the theory, and the book's authors don't address these concerns. Secondly, no one has really been able to provide a good reason why nature should be unified in the first place. The well-known Nobel prize winning particle physicist Martin Veltman has been especially critical of such attempts at constructing 'grand unified theories'. As he said in his Nobel Prize interview, there is no good scientific reason (except expectations of beauty and elegance which are not good metrics in themselves for judging scientific theories) why there should in fact be a unified theory. This is more of a fond expectation based on the history of physics than a reasonable hypothesis backed up by reasonable evidence. Yet Hawking and Mlodinow seem to push this much touted grand ambition.<br /><br />Hawking's arguments for a multiverse are likewise not backed up by evidence, but at least in this case the multiverse seems to provide a simple way out of the wavefunction collapse problem that has plagued the traditional Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory. The physicist David Deutsch who is a big proponent of the multiverse says that if a quantum computer were possible, the only way it could have enough 'space' to carry out all its computations is if there were multiple universes. So as fantastic as it sounds, the multiverse at least seems plausible.<br /><br />Of course, you have to be one of the chosen few to understand the gory details of M-theory. But even someone with a rudimentary understanding of the scientific method can see the problem with complex theories that are very difficult, if not impossible, to test and which are based mainly on mathematical elegance rather than concrete connections to reality. Unfortunately I thought that Hawking and Mlodinow buy too easily into such speculations. The ideas are fascinating by themselves, no doubt, but they don't belong to the domain of what eighteenth and nineteenth century pioneers of science would have called sound science. One expected a much more critical approach from a mind as accomplished as Hawking's.multiverse says that if a quantum computer were possible, the only way it could have enough 'space' to carry out all its computations is if there were multiple universes.

B002ZG99A4|4.0|What do you get when you join together some of the biggest action stars from the last three decades into one single movie? Well, in this particular instance, you get a testosterone-fueled, orgy of mayhem and destruction that is unrelentingly violent and undeniably exciting from start to finish. You get \\"The Expendables\\".    \\"The Expendables\\" follows the exploits of a group of guns for hire who are tasked with the job of overthrowing a cruel dictator. However, the mission becomes complicated by the fact that not everything is what it seems and betrayal seems to be the name of the game. To survive, the team must use every skill and weapon at their disposal and even then, that may not be enough to win the day.    I never would have thought that bringing together virtually every action star imaginable into one bombastic action extravaganza would work. I figured with so many egos and that much testosterone in one place, the movie would be nothing more than an obnoxiously noisy cacophony of explosions and gunfire with zero logic or cohesion behind it all. Yet, somehow director, co-writer and star Sylvester Stallone managed to make everyone play nice (so to speak) all the while creating a solid and engaging action movie in the process.    The story for this film, written by Dave Callaham (\\"Doom\\") and Sylvester Stallone is by no means filled with rich character development, drama, or an intricately conceived plot. Of course, for this type of film no one is really expecting Oscar caliber material in any capacity. Essentially, the story does just a little more than set up the next action sequence, but that's alright with me (in this rare instance). Because, if I wanted something more thought provoking or potentially enriching then I would have chosen a drama to begin with, and most likely Stallone and company would have been nowhere in sight.    I know that my being ok with a movie's story being nothing more than the glue holding a string of fight scenes together may seem a bit inconsistent. After all, this is typically the sort of thing that irritates me with so many action movies these days. The difference between \\"The Expendables\\" and all the others is that there's something enjoyable and entertaining about the movie besides the non-stop action. What it boils down to is this, what little story there is to be found is interesting enough to keep my attention; whereas, in so many of its contemporaries the bits of story tend to feel tedious and/or boring.    Speaking of action movies, it is becoming increasingly clear that Stallone has a very solid grasp on how not to make an action-centric movie feel stale or unexciting. First with \\"Rambo\\" and now \\"The Expendables\\", Sly knows how to give the audience just enough tidbits of story sprinkled between the action to keep the movie flowing, while at the same time never losing the momentum that the exciting action scenes are creating.    One of his choices, as both co-writer and director of this movie, which I really appreciated, was that he allowed each of his veteran action stars a moment to shine. Be they hero or villain, each and every one of them was allotted their fair share of the violent-driven spotlight.    Speaking of the stars, this assemblage of action heroes and villains proved that even though some of them may be a little long in the tooth, they've still got what it takes to kick some serious butt when the occasion arises. Now as far as acting goes, none of the stars really delivered anything note worthy in their performances. But, as I stated earlier, no one really expected Oscar caliber out of this film. All anyone wants to see out of the stars of this movie is them kicking butt and taking names. So long as they can still do that, then the audience will go home satisfied.    Also, within the movie's cast there were several cameos that serve as potential teasers for the inevitable sequel. For starters Bruce Willis (\\"RED\\") and Arnold Schwarzenegger (\\"Terminator: Salvation\\") both appeared in the same scene and threw several zingers each others way, all the while teasing at a history between themselves and Stallone's character, Barney which could prove interesting to explore.    Then there's Mickey Rourke (\\"Iron Man 2\\") as the tattoo artist and \\"agent\\", as it were, for Stallone's crew. Throughout his multi-scene appearance there are comments regarding the former mercenary life of Mickey's character, and there are glimpses of that man in a couple of scenes late in the film. Basically giving us enough information to garner interest, but not reveal too much so as to spoil future installments.    Perhaps, in the future we'll get to see more of what was teased to us during these cameos in the film. If so, then the sequels could prove to be just as entertaining, if not more so than the original. One thing is for certain, the appearances were fun little moments for fans of the action genre, and provided some intriguing character history for the franchise to explore later on.    Overall, \\"The Expendables\\" is an extremely fast-moving, hard-hitting action packed thrill ride that features an abundance of Hollywood's action stars and should easily satisfy even the most hardcore of action junkies.    \\"The Expendables\\" is rated R for violence and language.

0380713802|5.0|I was lucky enough to be able to interview Bill Bryson when this book came out, and the interview was for a literary magazine. I think people forget just how skillful good comic writing is. Humorous writers make it look so easy, but writing that can make you laugh out loud - and this does, on almost every page - has to be well-observed and sharply written. I also used to teach travel writing classes, and as well as using extracts from some of the more literary travel writers, like Bruce Chatwin and Paul Theroux, I also used extracts from this book, to encourage students to be more observational as they traveled the world. And in person Bill Bryson was charm itself, giving me several hours of his time, even though the interview was only for a tiny magazine.
B0037KMHRY|3.0|The songs were made to be played in the movie. Dont expect fast daft punk beats. Think about it this way: the entire album is the exact opposit of Derezzed. The songs are sad and slow. Derezzed is the only one I can listen to by itself but all the others are useless outside of movie. The songs are not bad though at all. This is probably one of the best movie scores out there. I will go see Tron to see the Derezzed scene with Daft Punk!    Conclusion: Other than Derezzed, dont expect to be listening to this with the volume all the way up while jumping. Maybe listen to it at night so it can help you go to sleep (you would skip derezzed of course).

B003ZHQVJO|5.0|If you are looking for 1998 Kid Rock then you may not love this CD.  However if you have an open mind and can appreciate what he's trying to do, you will like it.  I think there are 6-7 great songs on here, a few that are prety good and a few that are average.  I do wish he had one kick-butt rock song on it but maybe next time.  Kid sings from the heart and after you replay the songs a few times you can really feel it, which is why I think it's a great CD.
0553386794|1.0|I don't know how many times I stopped reading this book over the last few years. I would stop reading because the characters were not engaging, it was absolutely disgusting, or because I was just plain bored. But I kept hearing how good the book was so I would pick it back up and try again, thinking maybe I didn't get to the good part. Eventually, some of the characters did become likeable. But it seemed like it took about a hundred pages to even cycle back to the first POV (point of veiw) character, and over two hundred till I knew them enough to care at all. But the story never really soars. Its only grace is its unpredictability, but there wasn't really anything good or memorable.<br /><br />  GRRM is an excellent writer in some ways. Though his storytelling is run of the mill, his characters are deep and believable, and his world creation is good. But I had a number of difficulties liking the story.<br /><br />  He starts with too many POV's all at once. He could have introduced them better, since they're mostly together in the beginning. It would have worked better if he stuck with one POV for a good three chapters or so, until we got to know the rest of the Stark family, then he could use their POV's without confusion. Also, I found many of the characters too unlikeable to bear reading about them, though they do become more sympathetic as the story goes on.<br />  GRRM is excellent with realism, but he decided that realism is obtained by replacing all magic with incest, orgies, porn, and the like. Of course that's more realistic because those things actually exist, but that doesn't make it adult fantasy. I see the adult part, but where it the fantasy? Where's the magic or the sense of wonder? There is some, but not much. And the little magic that exists is beyond cliche -- brief use of dragons and flaming swords. And honestly the few magic elements were the most predictable part of the entire plot. In some ways it's closer to soap opera than fantasy, and it really reads more like a historic fiction set on another world than anything else. I suppose that's why some people like it, it really isn't fantasy but a different genre altogether, or at least another sub-genre.<br />  The story really isn't all that great. It's mostly a political intrigue story, but it takes forever to really get anywhere. There was nothing memorable in the entire plot. The characters were the high point, once they got going. They behaved realistically, rarely did the expected, and every action was well motivated. He made good use of primal responses (fear, jealousy, lust, etc.) as motivation.<br /><br />  That's just one man's opinion. No story is for everyone, no matter how great it is in the eyes of others. I prefer Tolkien, Robert Jordan, Ursula K Le Guin, David Farland, or maybe Goodkind (though he chafes me a little), or Modesitt, or Sanderson. But GRRM is okay if you can stomach it.ike a historic fiction set on another world than anything else.

B002ECJZ76|5.0|We have to admit the dubbing truly wasn't that bad. We were not able to locate this movie in original language with subtitles.    The story is super great. The imagination begins to run wild while the movie begins. One tries to figure out what's going to happen to this poor child. The boy's acting, as lead character, is better than one could hope for. His face expressions truly tell the story, along with his actions.    We suppose one could say this movie is mostly sad. But the main character adds so much to the movie and story, that there's a true delight and it certainly shines through.

B0037KMHRY|3.0|I have been freaking out about Tron since I first heard it announced. Huge fan. And when I heard that Daft Punk was doing the music I just about lost my mind. That being said, a huge disclaimer needs to be put on this thing...and that's this is not a new Daft Punk album...it's the score to a Major Motion Picture that was overseen by Daft Punk. So if you are expecting some dope beats from everybody's favorite Parisian House masters...you're going to be disappointed for the most part.     I am totally sure that as far as Sci-fi soundtracks go - this one is awesome. If you're the kind of cat that's into movie scores - you're in for a treat. Daft Punk sure has added something electric to this outside of the usual \\"Dramatic Strings\\" type of scores that are archetypal for this kind of thing.     I can't say I am surprised by the fact that this isn't what I was hoping it would be. I mean, it's a great score - and that's what it needs to be. But again if you're looking for a heaping help of Daft Punk awesomeness, check out Derezzed and call it a day. The rest of this album is the London Philharmonic doing it's thing.     If I had to listen to a movie score...it'd be this one. But I do want to caution all the folks out there thinking that this is something that it's not. And it really is not a new Daft Punk album. If you're cool with that then by all means check this out!
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|As \\"Who\\" fans know every Christmas Day in Britain. A Doctor Who special airs prior to the beginning of the series return.  This is a compilation of those featuring David Tennant. They are as excellent as the other programs in this series.
B0042MEQVG|3.0|There are legions of ardent fans of this Twilight Saga - this third installment is ECLIPSE - and they obviously have their reasons for loving both the books and the movies.  That's good news, especially for Stephenie Meyer who is probably only second to JK Rowling (Harry Potter series) in skyrocketing income from the transformation of book to screen adventure.  The scenery in Vancouver,BC is pretty and the music and lyrics  for the film by Howard Shore is meant to add to the story line.<br /><br />The script by Melissa Rosenberg (who has done some fine work on the television series 'Dexter') is written in staccato phrases - one-liners that don't really allow the actors to express much real emotion under such confines.  For this viewer this is one of the main reasons the film doesn't fly.  Even if one can buy into the fairytale atmosphere of flatline normal human girl Bella (Kristen Stewart) falling for rather stiff and distant and oh so proper vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson, who has proven in his other films 'Remember Me' and 'Little Ashes' that he actually CAN act) while at the same time falling in love with werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner, ever more buff and using his physique to great advantage in almost every scene), there are problems with the story for the casual viewer  who hasn't read the Twilight Saga or followed the previous films.  Despite the film's building to the altercation and confrontation between Seattle vampires versus the small town Cullen vampires now supported by the town's werewolves courtesy of Jacob et al the story feels static. No emotion: script versus acting - it is a toss up.  Once again Billy Burke and Anna Kendrick (so fine in 'Up in the Air') add to the quality.  The werewolves are huge and cuddly, and the blue meadow flowers serving as background for Edward and Bella that open and close the film are nice.<br /><br />And we have two more episodes to go - or more... Definitely an acquired taste. Grady Harp, December 10
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|For many many years,to me..Tom Baker was \\"The Doctor\\". With the rebirth of this series, I came to realize, David Tennant took the charachter to a whole different level. Now, to me..he is the definitive Doctor.As with all of this reborn series. The acting & writing are totally incredible. If your a fan of the past series, before it's financial hiatis. Discover this again on DVD or television and you too will be equally impressed by this fantastic British series.

B004498KPU|5.0|I've read multiple complaints here about people being upset over not including certain videos, but here's my take on it.<br /><br />Human Nature was not an official video, nor did he, his record label, studio, estate or anyone with connections to him whatsoever make, approve or consent to the video.  I won't go as far as say it was a \\"fan video\\", but it's in the same category.  I don't care if MTV or VH1 has shown it... they show a lot of things.  Therefore, while I think it's not only his best song on Thriller, but one of the best 3 songs he's ever recorded; I'm not in the least bit sad or upset that it wasn't included here.<br /><br />Also, We are the World wasn't an official Michael Jackson video, it was a side project.  So I can understand why that's not included either.  If they were to include it, it should also be included in DVD sets of videos from every other artist in the video (yes, even Dan Aykroyd).<br /><br />When it comes to Smooth Criminal, which is one of the to 3 songs I mentioned above, I love the version they included.  I think they wanted to include the most complete version that's considered an \\"official\\" video, and not that actual official video (plus, I HATE that the dance is sped up in the \\"actual\\" version, because I can't enjoy it).  But I'm also one that thinks the full second verse included in the Moonwalker is the best verse/part of the song, so I'm happy that it's there no matter what the rest of the video looks like (I'd even deal with the nasty blur effect as long as the full verse is there).  I had something else to say here but forgot what it was... I think my point is made though.<br /><br />I'm a little upset that the full version of Ghosts isn't included, but I realize DVD's can only have a certain number of GB on it, and/or only be a certain length of time.  They probably got really close to that with the second DVD so I can completely understand why the 40 minute movie isn't on there.  However, there was room on the third disc for at least the 9 minute video version of the song with the intro and outro.  I mean, I know they wanted to do them in order, but Ghosts isn't exactly an \\"official album track\\" of his, is it?  It could and should have been on the 3rd disc if they wanted to do it right.  Including the full 18 minute movie version of Bad plus the 11 minute version of Black or White (with the banned 6-7 minute dancing outro) but not the full Ghosts is just unacceptable.  However, I don't really care for Ghosts anyway (the song is mediocre at best, and the video is a disappointment to everything he's ever done... it's so unlike him).<br /><br />I don't really have any other complaints... everything is as it should be.  The boxy format doesn't bother me, because when his videos were shot they didn't have big screen or wide screen, so in order to blow them up to be formatted to fit our televisions, they'd have to sacrifice some quality.  And I know that's what remastering is for, but I'd rather see the videos in their original untouched format/quality (which I've learned is not how some of his early ones are in this set).<br /><br />Overall, as a lifetime fan of Michael Jackson (for 22 years now) and never having owned any of his sets, except for albums (no DVD's, no concerts, tours, behind the scenes, collections, etc.), I have to say I'm very pleased, impressed and excited at this over-the-top collection that I can sit and watch together, as a whole, for the very first time.  Some videos (4 or 5 to be exact) I didn't even know existed... but some shouldn't have, and I can understand why I'd never seen them before (in the case of Speed Demon and Liberian Girl, for example).<br /><br />So, all-in-all, this set amazes me, and I'm glad I bought it.

How someone can rate this as a 1 is beyond me.I like songs like blazin, save me, moment for life, even dear old nicki better than the radio songs. You can play this cd and not skip songs which is the biggest compliment any cd can get. No it's not a classic but it is a really good record.

0316096199|1.0|Though this book is written about a true rape and it is well written. So well written, it is a bit to graphic for schools to require. My daughter was given this book in her junior year in high school to read for a class then required to have class discussion and do a review for a final grade. She was uncomfortable with the graphic, real and scary story and asked to be given a different book to report on.  Though rape is a scary reality, I feel that some books should be left for each individual to choose to read. This book is not a book for public school to require. For all the parents out there who are not aware of your schools reading matterial, please take the time to be aware in the future.
B002V9PEU4|4.0|Here we are, closing in on 20 years after this movie's release and people STILL don't understand: this isn't an action movie, it's an action movie parody-basically one long in-joke. I saw this in a theater back in 1993 and loved it, because it wasn't meant to be taken seriously; it's Arnie lampooning himself (I'm Arnold Braunschweiger!) during his comedy movie era with other jokes tossed in. It doesn't always work, but it's great fun and this blu-ray was a long overdue re-release, even if it is bare-bones.
B003XKPPOU|4.0|The movie was very entertaining as a grown-up and as a child (all four grandchildren ages 3 to 6 enjoyed it.

B00002ZMNV|5.0|While bored a few weeks ago, I searched youtube for Metallica videos.  Thank God I did, because I never expected that this treasury existed.  After listening to a couple of songs on youtube, I ordered this DVD.<br /><br />Okay, so you might be thinking that I'm not a Metallica purist since I wasn't aware of this concert, and you'd be right.  However, I've converted every single person that I've shown this DVD into a Metallica fan, so I'm making up for it.<br /><br />Words cannot describe the power that the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra adds to this concert.  Every member of the orchestra had his/her A-game on that night, and they had an exhilarating time performing to that crowd.  My very favorite part is the cello solo in \\"Enter Sandman.\\"  Sends shivers up my spine every time.<br /><br />If you're on the fence wondering if this DVD is worth your money, I would push you off that fence and tell you that this is a rare find.  You will not regret buying this--you'll be headbanging and applauding shamelessly.<br /><br />Trust me on this one.
B003YOZNBK|5.0|A LOT OF MY FRIEND DIDN'T LIKE JONAH HEX AND GAVE IT A BAD RAP.<br /> WHEN I SAW THE FILM I COULDN'T SEE WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY SAID IT WAS A BAD MOVIE.<br />I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH, AND THOUGHT IT TO BE A GOOD FUN MOVIE TO WATCH FOR A DC COMIC COME TO LIFE ON SCREEN IT IS NOT DC BEST FILM BUT IT ISN'T BY ANY MEANS A BAD MOVIE.
1601251505|5.0|I will start off as most reviewers have by citing my gaming credentials, I have bee gaming for 30+ years and have been through the multiple iterations of D&D as well as other games, and I have to say that Pathfinder is one of the best revisions that I have seen.  The system takes what was good about 3.5 D&D and makes it better and doesn't try to reinvent the wheel in the process.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems that 3.5 had was that over its existence so much material had bee released by WOTC that the system had become unwieldly to manage.  The system's ridiculous number of core classes, prestige classes, feats, playable races, setting rules and more made it particulaly burdensome to GM.  The actual mechanics of the game were functional at the core but it needed some serious love to make friendlier to GM's and new players alike.  Enter Paizo with Pathfinder after WOTC elected to throw the baby and the bathwater out with 4E.<br /><br />If you have played 3.5 the updates will seem fresh but at the same time familiar, core races and classes remain the same but get fun new benefits which, as previous reviewers have stated make them playable without having to power game them just to stay alive.  I was particularly pleased with the revision of skills and the modification of when characters get additional feats as both of these things allow for greater customization of characters.  The streamlining of combat maneuvers with the new CMB/CMD might actually encourage people to perform these maneuvers as it won\\"t take the 5-15 minutes of downtime to review the rules.  It also is fairly easy to convert any of your old 3.5 materials to Pathfinder which given the economy is very considerate.<br /><br />The book itself is very well made, quality paper, excellent binding, very good interior art, and, unlike some of WOTC's 3.5 products, readable print.  The book is a bit awkward because of the weight but since you are getting two books for the price of one (PHB & DMG) a hefty book is not particularly surprizing. The layout is familiar and definitions for keywords are easy to find in the appendices.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you wanted a smarter, more streamlined and easier to run version of 3.5 D&D Pathfinder is an excellent choice.surprizing.

B0042RUMEQ|5.0|This cd is great. I do not know why people have to bash her. This is a cd I dont have to worry about skipping songs on. There is nothing wrong with a hip hop artist being a HUMAN BEING. It is ok for her to show all parts of herself, as she did with this album. The songs are awesome, just give it a chance before reading the negative comments. I applaud her for being a female rapper and not selling albums because she is talking about body parts (what you can do to them and such other nasty things). True legend in the making.
B003X2O6KW|4.0|When Kanye West and Lady Gaga planned a joint tour a while back, people balked. But in retrospect, the two have a lot in common. They're both highly creative pop superstars who are clearly driven by a desire for fame, money, and success, but they are both self-aware and perceptive enough to be constantly critiquing the lifestyle as much as they embody it. The difference between the two, aside from genre, is that, although Gaga shocks with her visuals, in interviews she portrays herself as benevolent and noncombative. West often seems determined to portray himself as unlikable as possible: picking fights, having inappropriate outbursts, behaving ungraciously and ungratefully.<br /><br />And yet he continues to deliver the goods. \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" is a great album. When last we heard from Kanye, on 808s and Heartbreak, he delivered a melancholy, minimalist record which found him often crooning instead of rapping. MBDTF finds him back in rap superstar mode, and the tracks are anything but minimalist. They're loud, they're bombastic, they're full of all sorts of tricks and bells and whistles and guest stars. The theme of the album, but sonically and lyrically, is excess. Kanye is a talented, rich, famous, oversexed egomaniac, and with this album he both glorifies himself and admonishes himself for it.
1453837736|3.0|I haven't read the book yet but what I wanna say is the book is too new and they were in a hurry of making or cutting this book which is result unsqare or imperfect cut.<br />The letters don't look straight and lean to the right then left when you turn to the next page. It's quite funny and make me a little unhappy about it.<br />Anyhow, I'm sure the story is as sweet as it has been. But next time, check your book shape!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Our family loves this movie!  Buddy the Elf is so naive and innocent. You can't help but laugh at the situations he finds himself in.  It's funny and heart warming, we enjoy it every Christmas.
B00428CPUY|4.0|I would rate this year's Crossroads concert about as high as 07's...where most of it is enjoyable, but you think, \\"Boy, I wish they had so-and-so play,\\" or \\"I wish they had played this song instead of that song...\\" I myself prefer all the blues material, and can very easily live without the pop stuff like Sheryl Crow (WHY?) or Citizen Cope, whoever that is. And his song, btw, was very anti-climactic being sandwiched in between E.C's two songs--that was pretty dumb. And his song was way boring, to boot. There are several guitar players I would have loved to see in this concert who musically who would have fit like a glove, but OK, Eric C. is not necessarily out to showcase only the top talent in the guitar virtuoso genre, and I guess that makes sense, since very few guitar virtuosos command any mainstream popularity. I did enjoy the major talent that Clapton did include, such as Sonny Landreth, Joe Bonamassa, Derek Trucks, Robert Randolph, and Jeff Beck, of course. Personally, I would have loved to see Eric Sardinas, Gary Moore, Chris Duarte and Los Lonely Boys added to the lineup...I wouldn't say that any of those acts are any more obscure than Sonny Landreth (who is incredible and much deserves mainstream attention).     I'm not much of a country music fan, but I did very much enjoy the country portion of the concert with Vince Gill, Albert Lee and James Burton. What a lineup! Some down-home pickin' and grinnin' going on there, and the ol' Tele twang was in full force front and center! Great stuff...    Unlike other comments I read, I thought Eric's own guitar performance was inspired enough...it's amazing how he has defied age...his singing and guitar playing has not deteriorated one bit. He doesn't have quite the fire and fluidity as from the days of Cream in the late 60's, but he seemed to give up that kind of playing as soon as Cream broke up--lol. His singing, of course, has only gotten better. My only criticism of Eric himself is his hair--GET A HAIRCUT! :-)Recommended for all guitar fans!
B000002B49|2.0|Well I'm certainly in the tiny minority here. I LOVED World Mix and was all excited about Boheme, but I can't stand it. I think it's godawful. I tried twice to listen to it and I just can't. The vocals are shrill, annoying and way too much. I prefer the subtle sampling of World Mix, not the full-on crooning of apparently entire folk songs on Boheme. Boheme seems a little cheesy to me (too close to eastern european folk music), and lacks the mysterious funk of World Mix. What a disappointment.
B002N5N5M0|3.0|it was several months before we viewed this video , it was not my favorite season for this series.  the last disc in this package was defective and would not play on our blu ray or regular player.  my kadoos are for amazon's action.  amazon sent a new packaged set...no hassels...thanks
B003KUSUG8|4.0|My favorite song on this album is Space Bound which was not on my list of songs as a reason to buy this ablum.
030726999X|3.0|I enjoyed this book. It's difficult to explain my issues without giving too much away, but by 2/3 the way in, there were so many high level people in the know that the ending couldn't possibly turn out any differently than it did. It lacked conflict, and was not all exciting. Other than that it was an enjoyable read.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|This is one of those wonderful times when the Collector's Edition items are more than just extra packaging in the box.  The 'making of' documentary was fascinating and the deleted/unfinished scenes were awesome -- especially the unfinished scenes.  You really appreciate the final work when you get a look at something that's just part way done & even *that* seems miraculous.
1608870081|5.0|This book is wonderful.  I thought it would be kiddy, cutesy type book but no it is like the movies.  Really great work on the pop ups and the side story's pop ups.  I love the dragon. Wonderful book to look at over and over.
0312360258|2.0|Hi everybody. I know doing a book is not easy. But let's start by the beginning.   First, look to the autors. 2. the daughter and the mummy. I was very pleased with that at first : \\" That's great to do that in family\\". But, in fact, they should have done 2 books, not 1. Sometimes, you see the style is a little too \\"what I am going to do my god\\" (like a little girl) and sometimes very mature. may'be I'm the only one who feel it. but I really feel it.  Turn the book.  Vampyres. Vampyres. Yeah, since the saga Twilight, everyone write on vampyres. please, stop that thing. I know Stephanie Meyer have found new ideas (if vampyres were good ? accepted ?) like it or not, but hey, that was her ideas. Stop writting about VAMPYRES just because it's FASHION. Now, there are people who write books with that only because of that. Im' not saying this book is really bad, I have wrote worse, but that wasn't the best.     So, let's start reading. I found myself lost at first. Yeah, that's great \\"putting action\\" but before... explain why there is action. Just a little. But whatever.     At the end, I really not recommend this book. If you're 13, may'be. Not after. (and, please, forgive me if I made mistakes, my natal language is not English. )
0316019984|3.0|The art work is good.  The work on the pop ups is great.  I just felt kind of let down on the whole book.  May be I am too old.  I love super woman.  These are my child hood hero's. It is a all right book.
B00004RFCM|1.0|The packaging for all 6 seasons is very poor. The DVD cases are tri-fold and made out of very poor quality plastic. I purchased all 6 seasons and have had trouble with the cases breaking apart at the folds. Poor quality product!
B00275EHJG|5.0|The DVD was received quickly (and it was an international shipment) arriving well before my son's birthday.  He loves it!! (his words :) and I'm just thrilled that I can share this movie with him as we already have Toy story 1 and 2.    Of course the movie itself is fantastic, even for the parents.  Brilliant buy and a must have for any toy story fan!
B001UV4XWY|2.0|I read what the movie was all about and I already figured... this can't be good.    First of all: why would you even discuss to push the button if you can kill some one, if you would believe it?  Second of all: why would you even consider to push the button if you don't believe it?    That was my first thought and I had the same thought till the end. I did wish it would be different, though! I found it rubbish from the beginning till the end. And the end made it even worse and even more unrealistic (as far as that was even possible). Ofcourse I can't tell the plot, but if you've seen it and think about it... this didn't help either, did it?    I saw the movie for free on tv and I wouldn't spend any money on it.
B003Y3BMFW|5.0|\\"Telephantasm\\" is the first release from Soundgarden since 1996 and is an excellent overview of their music.  It's a great intro to those not that familiar with the band or who only know their \\"Superunknown\\" period.  The two discs are very well recorded, and are sure to make you want to delve deeper into their music with \\"Badmotorfinger\\" being a good followup. What really sets the collection apart is the DVD of all their videos which is stunning and worth the price by itself.  I am very happy with \\"Telephantasm\\", if for no other reason, than to draw attention to the band.  Soundgarden has produced a wonderful catalog of music through the years which has drawn critical raves, a loyal fan base, and been a strong influence on many other musicians.  They are well worth your time so take a listen and see why Soungarden's music will stand the test of time.
1427210497|2.0|Authors supposedly despise having their novels speculated on as being autobiographical, and yet, it's hard to imagine Jonathan Franzen not identifying in many ways with his main protagonists in Freedom, especially Walter Berglund and Richard Katz. As read by David Ledoux, both characters are presented as bitter men, disappointed by others and inflexible in their opinions. At times, Ledoux infuses the characters' voices with barely restrained rage and disgust. It would be interesting to read the novel without the filter of Ledoux's interpretation.
B00000263T|4.0|And so begins the decline and it is a steady decline mostly in terms of direction and song quality that would plague German metal near greats Accept until the demise of their classic lineup before the `80's were over.  `Metal Heart' is very good but it is flat out not good enough; not when compare to the three discs that preceded it.  My biggest issue with the record is what happened to many metal acts by mid-decade; corporate America started to dictate to bands what the record buying public really wanted. Real metal fans started to lose here and the band's of course suffered if their bread and butter wasn't AOR or MTV friendly tunes. Much of `Metal Heart' is classic Accept heavy metal including the title track and \\"Living for Tonite\\". However there is most definitely a concerted effort to appeal to the chicks - bringing in Dieter Dierks who had whimpified along with his fellow protégés Scorpions and songs like \\"Screaming for a Love-Bite\\" (it's sweet like candy - which is hard to believe as Udo sings the verse in his trademark razor shredding shriek!).  Again I may be in the minority here but Accept was one of the woulda, shoulda, coulda bands that if they had stuck to their guns may have survived the `80's intact. They didn't and their first major casualty on the way to obscurity was Udo - who saw the writing on the wall.
B0042RUMFU|5.0|If you want real traditional Christmas songs \\"Mariah\\" style, you will absolutely LOVE this! The very last song is my favorite.

B000000SDB|4.0|Many listeners are already familiar with Harnoncourt's Beethoven cycle, previously released without the overtures, the mass, and the concertos. Those that have not heard this set or are unfamiliar with Harnoncourt are in for a treat, so long as they approach Harnoncourt's interpretations with open ears.     Indeed, across the board, Harnoncourt is up to his usual antics in this set. And I say that with all due respect to this great conductor, who's forays into Haydn I consider reference performances and who's Bruckner is revelatory. However, Harnoncourt is always controversial for his unique sense of discovery, and that quality certain pervades this set. Take, as a case study, the first movement of the Eighth, where Harnoncourt touches every measure with unique phrasing markings, extreme dynamics, and quirky punctuations. At times, his ideas can be somewhat off-putting or even strange. Take, for example, how the timpani and lower strings emphasize the three four time by accenting the downbeat during the C major cadence at the close of the exposition. Interesting, yes, but it covers up the violin figures and comes off more grotesque and vulgar than exciting. Or listen to how Harnoncourt's overly muscular handing of the beginning of the recapitulation almost completely covers the lower strings. On the other hand, listen to Harnoncourt's delightful handling of the declamatory two-four rhythmic outbursts where he really emphasizes the syncopated quality of the music. Or listen to how he really adds extra excitement to the already over-charged development with thrilling brass playing. Harnoncourt unearths many details and certainly presents this too-familiar music in a new light.     Another example is Harnoncourt's sixth, which was controversial then and remains an acquired taste. Harnoncourt's incredibly relaxed and \\"legato heavy\\" first movement really takes the cheerful title to heart. It is not the overwhelming joy of Toscanni and Vanska or the heartwarming cheer ofBohm or Dohnanyi - rather, it is a warm but restrained calm upon entering the country that never really seems to reach happy. Harnoncourt is saving true happiness for the finale - a valid interpretive idea - but it still results in underplayed first and second movements.    But when at his best, Harnoncourt can create magic like few other conductors. His seventh is a case-in-point, a reference performance if there ever was one. The finale is just the finest on disc, period. He takes it at a ferocious clip, but unlike Abbado in his first Berlin cycle, the Chamber Orchestra of Europe plays with a virtuosic flair that is nothing short of astounding. It must be heard to be believed!    Listeners who crave something new from the canonic nine would we well served to get this set. At the same time, listeners interested in purchasing just two or three sets of the Beethoven symphonies (really, who can own just one?) may be better served by other cycles. Szell's reference cycle is a nice alternative, as is Blomstedt, Bohm, Gardiner, Toscanini, or, more recently, Vanska or Jarvi. Still, Harnoncourt's cycle is absolutely necessary for those who want a well-rounded Beethoven collection. While his interpretations may be unconventional, I still find myself returning to this cycle and always find new surprises upon each hearing.
1416562605|5.0|Oh my goodness! This is a magnificent book. Had to applaud at the end of it.<br />Enough reviews have been written about this story, but I was especially impressed by the way the author engrosses one into the story, and the way that both servant and master change with time; one on his journey from the \\"Darkness to the Light\\", and the latter from his initial \\"America-returned ideals\\" to the real world.<br />Very impressive debut. Well deserving of the prestigious award, Mr.Adiga!!!<br />Must-read!

B000KX0IOA|5.0|Richard Allenborough who is known for Jurassic Park (1993) or Hamlet (1996), released another new film. Thistime about the moving life of Mahatma Gandhi. In 1983 the film was nominated for 11 Oscars. In the end he amazingly won 8 for example for the \\"Best Direction\\" and \\"Best Actor in a Leading Role\\". Ben Kingsley could also got many good critiques for his performance as Gandhi.  This movie is a biography about the whole life of Gandhi and how he was able to bring India it's Independence with his philosophy of non-violent protest. It begins with the young Gandhi when he starts to fight for the rights of all Indians in South Africa and ends with the Independence of India and the tragic death of Gandhi. In between there's a lot of time that shows many people who went with Gandhi and supported him and also the people who stood in his way to Independence. Personally, I think that this movie is really impressive and amazing, because it has many scenes where you can see how strong the power of will can be and what you can reach if you just believe in something. There will be scenes that make you speechless and you'll probably ask yourself how a man can have such a big patience to not gice up.    In the end you can say that this movie is for everybody because it wants to teach you a simple but one of the most important lessons of life: fight for your freedom and never give up.
0738702994|5.0|I love this deck.  I have a few decks, including the Rider-Waite, and in my opinion this is head and shoulders above the others, both in insightful and creative interpretation (the nature of the scenes, the inventiveness and appropriate suggestiveness of the imagery) and in execution (wonderful watercolour paintings).  Unlike for example the Palladini 'Aquarian' Tarot (which is often handsome in its own way), this is not a rather cold and 'two-dimensional/flat-surface' rendering but a body of artwork that balances depth and intricacy with a striking central image, in warmly evocative tones.  This is what I like best in tarot artwork:  decorative elements that are part of the card's meaning (rather than irrelevant to it), and a strongly immediate sense of what the card is about.  There is no 'slacking off', either, in the Minor Arcana cards (which in the hands of some artists can frankly be boring).  Many of the cards could sell as beautiful works in their own right, to be valued by any lover of art.  All the meanings are well captured by the deck and also well explained by the accompanying book, which I found valuable.  This is a highly artistic, sensitive, rich, and aspirational tarot, and I highly recommend it.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|Mariah really shines in this album.  Her voice sounds really strong, and to me this album is more diverse in terms of music style than her 1st Xmas CD.  It's a CD that everyone can enjoy during the holiday season.  My favorite \\"Oh Santa\\" has become the fastest rising song to reach #1 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart history since 1993 - in just two weeks.  Other favorites include the up-tempo \\"Here comes Santa Claus\\", the club dance interpretation of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" and of course the modern classic \\"All I want for Christmas is You\\" extra festive version.  You can really tell that Mariah made a great effort to write new songs that have potential to become modern classic Xmas songs

Its well written, the author creating a fully developed post-apocalyptic world, with very believable characters and a fast-paced plot.  Some of the action seemed a little harsh for a kid (say my 13 year old), but other than that, a riveting novel--for readers of ALL ages.

B002BSHXJA|3.0|You've got hundreds of reviews to review, so I'll just dwell on one aspect-the \\"remastering\\", theoretically the reason you're cosidering repurchasing or have been holding out this long. My reluctant advice if you've been holding out this long is-DON'T. Buy the albums that mean the most to you separately and wait some more for whatever \\"re-remastering\\" hype comes next. Compare these RM to the CDs Love and Yellow Submarine which were ACTUALLY remastered from the multi-track tapes. There IS no comparison. Those two discs blow the sound on these discs away.<br />I find the improvement in sound over the earlier CD versions extremely minimal. I was hoping for at least some more dynamic \\"punch\\" to these monos, especially Revolver, which sounds much more aggressive on the bootleg mono I have. This is definitly NOT the last chapter of Capitol trying to remilk the Beatles cash cow, so if you've been patient this long/already own the earlier CDs- hold out.<br />  Amazing how much overwhelmingly negative feedback I got initially on this review. The Mono box has dropped in value, the reviews have started to accumulate that this remastering isn't exactly the end all and be all. People somehow took umbrage at me criticizing the record label not, obviously, the quality of the Beatles work. Every word on my original review I stand by, but reasonable minds can disagree on whether this was a worthwhile sonic upgrade from the George Martin supervised CDs. To me they didn't justify buying the whole catalogue over again at inflated prices, that's all.
0312944098|5.0|A modern day spin on the premise of The Count of Monte Cristo. Two men share a jail cell--one from the wrong part of London, convicted for a murder he didn't commit and the other an aristocrat jailed for a dereliction of duty in the military. Ironically, they look enough alike to be brothers. During confinement, they become close friends. The aristocrat takes it upon himself to teach Danny, an uneducated laborer, to read and schools him in the manners of a gentleman. When something unprecedented happens, Danny takes over his friend Nicholas' identity, assets and freedom via a parole Nicholas had earned. What happens from that time on, is a tapestry of events, challenges, joys and much more, woven so expertly by Sir Jeffrey Archer. The intrigue is great, the twists present the unexpected and it is a book I could read over several times, each time discovering another nuance.<br /><br />ARLISS ADAMS<br />[...]<br />The Twist of Fate series<br />[[ASIN:1603182284 Devil's Dance]]<br />[[ASIN:1603182349 The Devil's Due]]
142338928X|5.0|Book recommended by a friend that I could not find time to read. With this audio copy I was able to listen to the book while driving and a work. It was definitely all my friend had said. A great book worth the cost to me to get it in audio format.
B00436GNVC|1.0|Have just played 'Endlessly'. All I can say is thank god I didn't pay for it (I was given a copy)! Duffy should never have been allowed to produce the album herself. On 'Well Well Well' she sounds like Cilla Black on helium! Little wonder this first single from the album only reached #41 in the UK. 'Keeping My Baby' is just a bad remake of 'Papa Don't Preach'. On 'Breath Away' she painfully strains to hit the top notes. The two best tracks are 'My Boy' and the discofied 'Lovestruck'. I loved 'Rockferry' so find this such a disappointment. Sadly she appears to be just a one trick pony.
B0000524CY|5.0|THE SCARIEST MOVIE EVER. EVER. Gruesome imagery with f-bombs galore is for starters. Do not ever watch this movie at night or alone. I MEAN IT. The thing that makes this even more scary(if that's possible!) is that it actually happens and is making a comeback! Rated R is an understatement! Test your faith. Prove your supernatural strength. That is what this movie was made for. Literally. Ever fight a demon-possessed person? Ever try to get rid of the demon in them? Leave it to the experts but if you want to test yourself in a somewhat safe environment, this is the movie. I MEAN IT.
B000002GB6|5.0|i owned this record once upon a time.  just purchased it again and was pleasantly surprised how much i enjoy the smooth jazz of chuck and his not so ordinary horn.  every cut from start to finish is great for background music during dinner or being with friends.  i am also known for turning the volume up when everyone else is out. very happy i gave it a second chance.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|All of this artists hits are included in this deluxe edition. Too many to list here. \\"Pokerface\\" and \\"Bad Romance\\" are for starters. If you like Lady Gaga, this is a must!
1439107955|5.0|A good friend of mine recently was diagnosed with cancer.  Not knowing  anything about cancer but that it kills millions of people every year---- I felt compelled to buy this book.  Very educational and a great read.  Its not the best topic to be reading about but I feel like I;m glad I know more about this horrible disease. Hopefully with continued  research more and more people will get cured.  This is a step in the right direction.  A book worth buying.
B00006F2TV|5.0|This is a far better version of Spider-Man in live action than the horrible 70's series. No comparison. I liked Dr. Strange in the 70's live action version but not Spider-Man. This modern version is light years better and thank GOD Marvel did it right! Right up there with the Fantastic Four or the Hulk! In this movie, Parker first gets his powers and fights his first super villain. If you've ever liked the character in comics or animation, this is a must have!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|turtle beach is truly the way to go for the best sound quality out of a game or just to watch a movie with. you will here sounds you didn't know exist in the games lol and you will be glad you did.
B000002WAD|5.0|80's pop with a little r&b mixed in is how to describe this artist. \\"Never Gonna' Give You Up\\", \\"Together Forever\\", and more are all included. Although made fun of a lot(there is an actual Adblock filter for his ads!), it's just like disco; you listened to it back then and you know it! Outdated, yes. Remembered? Yes.
B002ZG981E|4.0|After watching this I can see why the director I heard spent 10 years thinking this movie up.<br />Overly complicated film version of the saying 'Life is nothing but a dream.'<br />Also, was it just me or was the audio pretty garbled in a lot of scenes that I had to watch it with subtitles.<br />I give it 4 stars for replay value. If you said you understood everything in the first viewing you are as big of a liar as those that say they understood \\"Donnie Darko\\" the first time through LOL.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|Pick a Houston hit, it is on this collection. Videos, not just audios. Too many hits to list here. Pick one and I guarantee you you will find it on this DVD. Well worth the price!
B004BSFSTA|4.0|These headphones have the best sound quality I have ever heard. Great bass, and guitars whine and scream, with the sound so pure. The sound is simply amazing.     Build quality is also great, the headphones feel really solid, with the earmuffs made of high-impact resistant plastic. The wire also feels a tad thicker than most earphones, so you can assure yourself that it's not going to break. I especially like that there is a springy-stretch length that makes stretching out the wire painless. The inside of the muffs and the bridge between the two are made of leather, with the leather on the muffs feeling soft and the leather up top rough and weathered. Great coverings. The headphone jack is also one solid piece, so you don't have to worry about it coming apart like some other headphones. I don't really like that the muffs come down from the frame with flimsy-looking rods, but that's nitpicking, and they don't seem to be falling apart soon. There's a signature of Jim Marshall on the inside of the bridge, a nice touch. Keep in mind it's not indestructible though.    The one thing I actually don't like is how they feel on my ears. I wear glasses, and these headphones press kinda tightly against my ears, so I have to take them off after a while. They also make my ears feel very hot, which I don't like and takes a little bit to cool down. Not that comfy, if you ask me, but the sound far outweighs the discomfort.   The last feature is these headphones compact into a small blob of stuff, so you can easily store them away.     These are absolutely great headphones, and if you love great sound and don't really care about comfort, these are for you. Sure they're a tad expensive, but they're worth it. 4 out of 5 for comfort.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|The most scary accurate depiction of nuclear war ever made. This movie has not been aired in possibly over a decade on any TV channel due to the level of graphic depictions of nuclear explosions, radiation sicknesses, and otherwise gruesome imagery that back in the early 80's had never been seen before on TV and barely in movies. If you want the truth about nukes, this is as accurate as it gets. One word of warning. This is VERY disturbing because you know THIS CAN ACTUALLY HAPPEN. If you don't believe in GOD, you will want to after viewing this and not because it is a Christian film. Very thought provoking and scary. Real life's worst nightmare. One line sums it up:\\"is there anyone alive?! Anyone at all!?\\"
0143118420|1.0|I love spiritual journeys and all, but this was painful to read, not particularly well written, and unbelievably self centered.  I made it about three quarters of the way through the book before I gave up.
B003L77TZI|5.0|Soon to be Russell Brand's wife, Katy Perry is putting out some strong bubble gum on this album. TOO strong for some kids which explains the sticker label. Snoop Dogg makes a guest solo on this album in \\"California Girls\\" which was/is a big hit. You already know the others and if you don't, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN!?
B000R9RGF6|5.0|I hadn't heard of Ludovico Einaudi until recently, now I'm hooked on him. I love all of his piano pieces, particularly \\"Primavera\\" which is my favorite, \\"Uno\\" a close second. I discovered Einaudi (and other artists I like) on the Echoes radio program. Echoes has new age type music, sometimes a little too way out, but occasionally I've found new artists I've become very fond of in the last few years. Ludovico Einaudi's music is sensuous and relaxing, so much so, it sometimes sends me off into a trance and lulls me to sleep. I suffer from chronic insomnia, so it is very welcome! He plays with so much feeling that I want more of him, he really touches my soul. I checked out all his music and decided \\"Ludovico's Divenire\\" CD and \\"I Giorni\\" are the best so I bought both, and I'm very happy with my purchase. He has a classical sound, and is modern at the same time, very unique. I cannot imagine anyone not liking this CD, it is now one of my top favorites.
B00001ZULV|4.0|Although a good compilation, I think I wanted Phil Collins' Hits more than this collection. Too many to list here. If you like \\"Land of Confusion\\" and all those others, this is for you. Very good album.
B001IF252C|1.0|I purchased this dual link adapter, hoping it would give me the best resolution from my new Dell 30-inch monitor U3011.  It did not - the resolution was at 1600 and looked worse than that.  Think first CRT monitors.  I ended up purchasing just a cord - a minidisplay port to a display port cord.  ONLY if I set my display settings to Mirror, was the cord able to give me 2560 x 1600 resolution.  My laptop (MacBookPro mid-2008) said it had the ability to pump out this level and indeed it did, but only with a basic $7-$10 cord.  Other reviewers mentioned flickering with this item.  I had zero flickering.  If you do go the route of just the cord, you will have a great deal of flickering until you Mirror and turn off overscan in your display/system preferences screens.
1439177783|5.0|I don't read books, but bought this one, along with the audiobook. They were great. Let's you in on how someone thinks.. great great book
0517214628|5.0|I loved this book! I just reread it for the first time as an adult and was overwhelmed with the life lessons learned. I was so moved by the characters and their determination to live a good Christian life amidst trials. I especially liked reading about their mother \\"Marmie\\". She is the best example of how to be a mother and raise children. I ordered this copy for all of my friends for Christmas because it's older and cherished, and because of the Jessie Wilcox Smith color illustration on the cover. I put a note inside that reads, \\"My favorite book, for my favorite people\\". I loved this book!
B004498KPU|5.0|I love the idea of having all of Michael Jackson's short films on 3 dics.  my only complaint is that is does not have We are the World and it does not include the full version of Ghosts!   I LOVE GHOSTS SO MUCH! it is probably one of my favs.  So imagine my disappointment when it was some edited cut up verion!
B00000251N|5.0|Used to listen to this growing up. It was great for doing my Calculus problems in school.  Excellent instrumental and who doesn't enjoy Diamond?
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Its a wonderful little movie my grandson watches it @ least 4 times a day. Well worth the money @ 12.00
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I thought it was a great book with many twists and turns. But however, at some times the book can get boring. So sometimes I found myself slowing down and speeding up my reading process. I loved the surprise ending!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I love this book! It made me laugh, cry, and it made love my dogs even more than I did. I wish they could speak so they could tell me if I make them as happy as they make me.
0374158460|1.0|I share Franzen's view of the zeitgeist, so I expected to gladly ride along on this journey through the empty suburbs of modern-day America, savoring the pathos. I just can't do it anymore, though. I'm several hundred pages in and Patty and Walter still feel inch-deep and others read more like caricatures. I assume that populating his storyworld with shallow characters is part of the author's statement about the Way We Live Today - in that respect it's very Literary.  No, it's not that the characters are unlikable - although they are - the fatal error is that they're insipid. (I allow the exception of Richard Katz. I am slightly curious what happens to him, so there is evidence that Franzen can create an unlikable character who is compelling. That's all I'm asking - I don't have to like them, but they do have to elicit some emotional response.)    I give Franzen kudos for tone.  He really made me feel the emptiness of the lifestyle he depicts (I hope that was part of the plan) and there are nuggets of brilliant prose, but they're too few and far between to trudge through a dull story full of wearisome characters. I give it one star because I hate not finishing books, yet I just can't make myself keep going.
0061537969|5.0|Love, love, love.  I love this book.  Some people might think this book is about a relationship between a human and his dog.  I see it as far more than that... commentary on human existence from a typically silent perspective.  It's so interesting what Enzo picks up on!
B0007MWZEK|3.0|This is an interesting product in that I can't quite make out why people go crazy over it. Sure it eliminates having to mess with a dust pan if you use a broom, but you still have to bend over to release and reinstall the very small built in dust tray.    It does pick up link and large particles, but not as effectively as a broom does, especially if you are not in a rush with the broom.     This is our second unit and although its convenient (which is its only real, useful, benefit, the battery life is poor (this is our second unit    I'm away that he new G2 model has a much improved battery, but the price is triple what you can get the original sweeper for, and ten times higher than a broom.    The motor is very weak (I've experienced this one two brand new units) and if anyone has long hair in the household, it will wrap around the brushes and really lower battery life to barely a few minutes between charges (barely enough to get the kitchen floor done)    Considering that it does not pick up everything off the floor, you can only use it on smooth floors (on rugs and carpets, the motor slows down so much that it reduces battery life to about one minute), and you have to clean out the dust tray every time you use it because it fills too quickly, its barely worth $20 that its available for at the time of this writing, but its convenient for a quick pickup of lint if you plan on emptying the dust pan at a later time.
0545265355|5.0|What a wonderful trilogy- captivating, entertaining and fun! It doesn't matter if you're a young adult or an older adult, this trilogy was a good read!
B001EN71DG|2.0|I bought this a while back, when it came in the nice metal case. I was extremely disappointed. I only bought this version because it contained the original, unaltered movies as well as the newly bastardized versions. Well, the unaltered versions aren't remastered at all, they're straight transfers of the Laserdiscs. Which is extremely low quality. If you have a 16x9 TV you'll have to use the zoom feature to fill the screen, just like with a laserdisc, and the subtitles for Greedo and the other characters are BELOW the 16x9 viewing area, in the black bar that would normally be on the bottom of the screen when watching on a 4x3 standard tv set.     This is not what I paid $60 for.
0061122416|5.0|This book is short, simple and beautifully made, but it made me feel limitless and filled with hope.  This story is touching and inspiring, especially for those that have dreams.  I highly recommend it!  Those that gave negative reviews only feel threatened for their dreams have been dashed over their lifetimes. This book will make you believe again.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|This is a must have for all fans (with blue-ray disc players, of course)! I really enjoyed the Alien franchise!     1. ALIEN- a great movie! A great story to tell about seven humans landing on an unknown planet and picking up an alien that slaughters them one-by-one!  I liked it very much a good blend of drama, a few laughs, and suspense! A bit slow at times, but plays out nicely! My grade: A- or Four Stars!    2. ALIENS- an excellent flick! One of few sequels that beats the original in many ways! Full of excitement! Full of action! Some laughs! A lot of suspense! And more...! Great and memorable characters! My grade: A+ or Five Stars!    3. ALIEN 3- bad, just flat out bad! A waste! A disgrace to the alien franchise!  What was bad about it?:  1. All the characters who fought through hell to survive in the last movie die at the very beginning!  2. There was no plot to the movie!  3. Too much whispering!  4. They butcher the F-word!  5. Too slow!  6. All the main characters in this movie die as well!    My dear reader, my list of complains with this movie go on and on... the only thing you need to know about this movie is that Ripley / Sigourney Weaver dies at the end. Bottom line; avoid this piece of crap, just go to the fourth movie instead! My grade: F or One Star!    4. Alien Resurrection- corrects a lot of the mistakes that Alien 3 made but still lacks some of the charm of the first two movies! The plot was good, the action strong! And each character served a purpose! A big improvement over the last one! My grade: B or Three-and-a-half Stars!    Well that was my review on all four movies! I enjoyed three of these movies as you just read, but hey, it was just my opinion.    My overall grade: A- or Four Stars!
B003L20IHE|5.0|This is a really good movie! I don't know how this movie did in theaters, but I hope it did well because there should be more movies like it. It was heartfelt and moving without being cheesy. The acting was really good too, which I appreciated since I hate seeing bad acting in a movie with a good plot. Thumbs up!
0470449756|5.0|The book was very new.  It reached my address in less than a week.  Excellent postage service.  Definately recommend this seller.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|What can I say...this movie has been the highlight of our annual \\"B Family Dysfunctional Christmas Party.\\" The only rules include:    1.only junk food allowed to be eated,and  2.only alcohol product to be consumed.    We watch \\"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\\" as well as \\"Office Space\\" as we tie one on (as a family of course).     Highly recommended for portraying a typical North American Christmas full of overblown expectations and totally square yuppies who live next door.    Thanks for a providing us with a Christmas ritual...
B004EI3ON4|5.0|Let me just start out by stating that Daft Punk is/are my favorite artist(s). Yes, I'm one of those devoted people who will buy multiple copies to get all of the exclusives.  I own literally everything they've ever done. Everything from official releases, to live concert recordings, to dozens of other various bootlegs. So needless to say, when I heard they were approached to compose the score for the upcoming Tron Legacy film I was beyond ecstatic. As a child I grew up watching the movie Tron many times but it never really stuck with me compared to the likes of other sci-fi films such as Star Wars, Alien etc.. Tron's original soundtrack by Wendy Carlos never left an impression with me either even being a film score and electronica fanatic. Now, times have changed and Daft Punk has blessed us with the Tron Legacy score. No strangers to film, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo have the combined talents of film production, cinematography and film score composition all under their belts. This is all in addition to their enormous amount of material released under the Daft Punk name as well as many others. Bangalter also composed the score to French film, Irr&eacute;versible in 2002. de Homem-Christo has also worked as a film director in addition to his music production. Together, over the last 17+ years Daft Punk has produced some of the most brilliant and timeless electronic music enthusiasts like myself have ever heard. I still remember being completely floored the very first time I listened to their \\"Homework\\" album. Tron Legacy is their first collaboration in years and I'm happy to report that it delivers. Faithful to the Tron style, if fits the theme of the film flawlessly in every way. Here are my thoughts and track ratings on Daft Punk's \\"Tron Legacy\\" soundtrack;<br /><br />1. Overture 8/10 (Grand and sweeping orchestral theme)<br />2. The Grid 8/10 (Jeff Bridges vocal samples over an intro track)<br />3. The Son of Flynn 8/10 (Melodic synthesizer)<br />4. Recognizer 10/10 (Epic and moving electronic strings and horns)<br />5. Armory 8/10 (Slow soundscape)<br />6. Arena 8/10 (Building synth and drum track)<br />7. Rinzler 10/10 (Fast paced building drum, string and synth track)<br />8. The Game Has Changed 10/10 (A perfect blend of tracks 4 & 7)<br />9. Outlands 9/10 (Fast paced strings and horns)<br />10. Adagio for TRON 8/10 (Orchestral & electronic Adagio blend)<br />11. Nocturne 8/10 (Melancholic and slow)<br />12. End of Line 8/10 (Synth, beats with arcade game sounds)<br />13. Derezzed 10/10 (Daft Punk 4x4 electronic brilliance)<br />14. Fall 10/10 (Frantic strings, drums, horns and feedback)<br />15. Solar Sailer 8/10 (Peaceful electronica)<br />16. Rectifier 10/10 (Dark and menacing strings and horns)<br />17. Disc Wars 9/10 (Tense and building strings, synth and drums)<br />18. C.L.U. 10/10 (More tense building strings, synth, horns and drums)<br />19. Arrival 8/10 (Sorrowful track reminiscent of Vangelis' Bladerunner)<br />20. Flynn Lives 8/10 (Triumphant and redeeming horns and strings)<br />21. TRON Legacy (End Titles) 9/10 (Traditional 808/909 sounding synthesizer track) 8/10<br />22. Finale 8/10 (Uplifting orchestral)<br />23. Sea of Simulation (Amazon Exclusive) 8/10 (Standard synth track.  Not a mind blowing exclusive, but I'll take it nonetheless)<br /><br />Brilliantly composed and arranged in nearly every way I can think of no better choice than Daft Punk to have scored the next installment of Tron. Filled with a fantastic blend of electronic beats, smooth synthesizers, staccato strings, driving drums and epic horns, Tron Legacy is everything both Daft Punk and Tron fans can appreciate. With the film quickly approaching I know I'll be going to see it simply to hear Daft Punk's score blasting out of the theater's speaker system accompanying what I'm hoping to be a mesmerizing continuation of the original Tron. Even though I wouldn't consider myself a huge Tron fan, I have to admit, after hearing Daft Punk's score, I'm a lot more excited about the film.
B000AP04L0|5.0|Perhaps not your first choice for a Christmas movie but \\"Office Space\\" is a great tool to bring any family together that has lived through \\"cubicle hell.\\" No other dotcom company can mirror the uselessness of corporate society. Throw in a little Jennifer Aniston who looks great in flair and we have a recipe for a cult classic. I highly recommend this movie for its originality. Who hasn't wanted to kill the company printer or cut fish at their desk. A winner.
B00003CX8Y|2.0|Unfortuantely, the 2-DVD disc arrived packaged with only one DVD and as it stands will not be here in time for Hanukkah.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Finally the muppets got it right letting Kermit and Miss Piggy hook up. Michael Caine is wonderful as Scrooge and with Rizzo the Rat and Gonzo narrating this Christmas Classic is brought to life with humor and a wonderful holiday message. A great cast of loveable characters all have their role. A yearly event in our house regardless of the age. Classic
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This movie is kind of different, but that is only to be expected from Studio Ghibli. I really enjoyed watching it and it was in fantastic condition when it arrived! I love this movie!
B004FEFZU2|5.0|Jigsaw definitely saved the best for last. A lot of loose ends are tied up. All the pieces now fit together. The final chapter has everything you could ask for in a Saw film. It did seem a little rushed, but it was very suspenseful. I loved all the new traps and twists. The only flaw is that Tobin Bell didn't have enough screen-time as Jigsaw, but you may not notice because of all the new games being played. It was good to see Cary Elwes back as the infamous Dr. Gordon. Hoffman has become more of a serial killer this time and tries to find Jill. An author named Bobby Dagen has written a book about how he survived a Jigsaw trap, but it's all a lie. When Bobby is really thrust into a game, he has sixty minutes to save his wife, or she will die. The Saw franchise has had a good run. I'll miss seeing them at the theater every year. I highly recommend SAW 3D: THE FINAL CHAPTER!!!
B00000DHR0|5.0|This is a wonderful CD and when I purchased it, it came quickity quick! Thank you<br /><br />bellasbelly
0307266303|5.0|This is a book I normally would not have read, because I am not a runner. But I heard an interview with the author on the radio and found his story intriguing so I bought the book. The book was interesting on two fronts -- a glimpse into the life of these reclusive people living in remote canyons of Mexico and the idea of running without expensive fancy running shoes. It also presented information on a lifestyle I had had no previous link with, the UltraRunners. This book was inspiring to me as I have actually, in my 50s, started running ten minutes a day as a result. So far, so good. I liked the book so much I also bought a copy for my nephew.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I love this cd! I'm super happy because it came very quickly. I was amazed! Excellent condition too!<br /><br />thank you<br />bellasbelly
B00000IMTE|3.0|I wish I had my old vinyl to run a comparison test.   I seem to remember some really majestic singing on this album.  This album has been \\"remastered\\"  which more often than not appears to be a euphamism for made-substantially-worse-than-the-original.  The instrumentals overpower the vocals on Man on the Silver Mountain and Black Sheep of the Family.  If You Don't Like Rock-n-Roll may as well be an instrumental arrangement.    On the bright side, the sound is really brilliant so there is hope for the next remastering, perhaps someone with an appreciation for great rock can make this the 5 that it should be.    Here is a little hint for whoever runs these projects...  If I wanted to listen to music that thumps, I would just open my window and listen to the sociopaths driving down the street.    Here is a question for Amazon... Why do the samples sound better than the CD?  Whover produces the samples should be doing the entire album.
B004EI7386|5.0|This is Daft Punk.<br />This is not Daft Punk as you've heard them before.<br /><br />Listen to the previews for the tracks before buying. Watch some of the movie trailers on YouTube. I'd suggest paying close attention so that you know what you're buying... because you're in for the ride of your life.<br /><br />With their considerable talent and a full orchestra to back up their efforts, Daft Punk refused to simply refine older techniques into a movie score. The soundtrack is just that - a score for a movie that sounds as epic and expansive as I expect from the Tron universe. It is darker, yes. It is not music that you'll hear playing in a club. If you're looking for a score and not an album (this is no Discovery), go ahead and buy. You'll be very happy with the decision.<br /><br />My personal favorite tracks:<br />It's impossible to ignore \\"Derezzed.\\" In the rush to listen to the song, though, I nearly brushed over \\"End of Line,\\" a slower, more insistent track that catches some of the same darkness that is hinted at in \\"Derezzed.\\" There is a thickness to the production of these tracks that crowds up around your ears; the presence of noise and slight blips and beeps underneath the melody fascinates me as I keep picking out new elements in every listen-through.<br /><br />When I finally get to see the movie, I intend to stay through the credits. Both \\"Tron Legacy (End Titles)\\" and \\"Finale\\" seem to cap off the soundtrack well - though the swelling low brass of \\"Finale\\" leads me to believe that we'll see content after the titles when the movie reaches theaters. Or the credits will be significantly long.<br /><br />The Amazon Exclusive track, \\"Sea of Simulation,\\" is interesting to say the least. I've moved it to several spots within the order so that it doesn't hide away at the end of \\"Finale.\\" Despite the efforts, though, I haven't found a good spot for it. It has the tone that reminds me slightly of \\"Solar Sailer,\\" another one of the stand-out tracks in the score, with a brighter tone and a quicker tempo. If \\"Sea of Simulation\\" is the deciding factor between buying this soundtrack on Amazon mp3 or purchasing a physical copy, I suggest the digital copy with the exclusive song.of Simulation\\" is the deciding factor between buying this soundtrack on Amazon mp3 or purchasing a physical copy, I suggest the digital copy with the exclusive song.
B00006DEF9|5.0|I bought this to share with my four children and myself. I loved this movie as a little girl and still love it to this day. It is such a wonderful movie and fun to watch with the kids and hear them laugh...some things never change!
B003KGBISY|3.0|Does not feel as long as total minutes suggest. Not much meat though. Some moments of mature human relationships. Some fine cinematography (in woods) and dialectic scene construction (graveyard finale), with good musical effects throughout. Otherwise, notable for how idiotic the farmers are, like lemmings, and the crying/despairing men (reminds me of Ranma 1/2). Not a bad movie, but not memorable or endearing to me. A few slim but interesting views of peasant architecture and hygiene, and a few scenes of old style agriculture with music (planting out rice seedlings).
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Last year around this time I decided to see what all the hype was about with the entrance of gaming headsets and bought a pair of turtle beach x1's and fell in love with them. Fast forward to this year and I again found myself looking at what the different companies out there were offering in thier latest and greatest headset tech. After a few hours of research (reading reviews, comments and product specs) I decided to go with the X41's. After giving them a good testing period I can honestly say I can't believe it took me this long to get these things. Sound is crisp and clear and the wireless feature is crutial. I could really go on and on about these but I have a lot to do today. Keep in mind I live in an appartment with wireless networks all around me and have not personally experienced the issues you may read on a select few reviews. If you want a good headset but dont wont to drop the bones for Astros, these fit the bill. I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER WITH MY PURCHASE!!!!
B003Y8YXEO|4.0|Wow, there are some strong negative reviews here, but for me, this isn't a bad collection.  I never transitioned my Lennon albums (the few that I had) to CD, and was never a big fan of his album work.  He was spotty, at best, in my humble opinion.  So this collection works pretty well for the average person who is interested in Lennon's work without slogging through, for instance, the weak album \\"Rock and Roll\\" (among others).  I wish that Yoko had spent some time on a booklet or something to go with this collection, but this was obviously done for the casual purchaser, not the serious collector.  As such, I think it works fine.
B002VECM4A|3.0|The open casting call for Precious cannot have had a large turnout. Just how many three hundred pound teenagers can portray the harrowing life of an illiterate girl ferociously abused by her mother; impregnated twice by her father; and who lives now on welfare in a decrepit home in Harlem. And yet, Leah Daniels-Butler, the casting director, might well have found someone with more emotional depth than Gabourey Sidibe.    Precious, quite frankly, is an artistic mess. The movie opens softly, views of a bridge's underpass, the tinkling of a music box. We see Precious, looking chic and mod, being approached by a thin woman in an orange evening dress. Wait. Isn't this supposed to be about a tortured, underprivileged teenager? Yes, it is, as the harsh ring of a school bell interrupts the fantasy and we are thrown whole-heartedly into Precious' world through her own narrative. \\"I wanna be on the cover of a magazine. But first I wanna be in one a' dem BET videos. Mama says I can't dance. She says who wanna see my big ass dancin' anyhow?\\" Scene after scene shows Precious being abused; delinquents in her class make fun of her, a boy on the street pushes her down, and of course her cruel, vicious, retched, utterly horrifying mother (the only shining light in the film, Mo'Nique). Precious lives the worst life imaginable. Yet, through what should be an emotional rollercoaster, Sidibe gives us one facial expression: blank. She gives one voice: monotone. A little smirk comes to her lips when thinking about her cute math teacher...and that's about it. The audience is met with a girl who should feel everything, anything and yet gives barely a glimmer of feeling. One could argue that Sidibe plays Precious as being numb; that her life and circumstances have brought her down so much that her only way out is to not feel anything. Plausible? Sure. Entertaining cinema? Negative.   Cinematographically, this movie does not know what it wants to be. Sepia tones bring us into Precious' home grittily and beautifully. Yellowish light is cast over the small apartment, taking us into a place where no one would ever want to live. If only this lasted the duration of the film. When Precious arrives for her first day of the \\"alternative school\\", Each One Teach One, after she was expelled from her public high school for getting pregnant, white light settles over the teacher, Blu Rain (a charming yet typical Paula Patton) and the classroom, cheesy symbolism for Precious' hopeful future if she continues with her education. Sometimes the film is shot in handheld but not nearly enough. The entire film should have been shot in handheld--it would have better captured the personal and very real quality that the director, Lee Daniels, and presumably Sapphire, the author of the original novel Push, intended. A major mistake in this film was the direction (and quite possibly inclusion) of Precious' fantasies. At various moments, we follow Precious into a dream world, one where she is a movie star, adored by millions, with beautiful clothes and a light-skinned boyfriend that dotes on her. These fantasies are so cheaply shot and frankly ruin what had the potential to be a stunning, powerful film. For a story so grounded in reality, why take us into these surreal moments that add nothing to the film itself? Daniels, you are not Fellini. Don't try to be. Perhaps the intention behind the breaks in reality were sound; Precious is a teenage girl who dreams of a better life, of course, who in her situation wouldn't fantasize about something more? Her dreams are just presented so cheaply. When Precious looks through a photo album, the pictures talk to her. When she is getting dressed in the morning, she sees a blonde, white girl in the mirror. Visually projecting Precious' desires in this manner detracts from the gritty realism of her situation. The dialogues of her Each One Teach One classmates are light-hearted and humorous, providing a much-needed break from Precious' depressingconditions. \\"You've got a nasty ass hat\\" is a retort to \\"you've got a nasty ass mouth\\"; that is much more laugh- and smile-inducing than Precious waltzing down a red carpet.    The real reason this film deserves any attention is Mo'Nique's performance as Precious' mother. She is phenomenal. She brings this despicable, disgusting, maniacal woman to life with vicious ferocity. Her eyes are filled with hatred whenever she looks at Precious. Her slow draws on her cigarettes evoke a slovenly and sluggish existence. Our introduction to this vile woman is when she throws a heavy pan at Precious' head. Yet Mo'Nique brings several dimensions to this potentially one-sided character. She dances while watching $10,000 Pyramid and wearing a floral jumpsuit. She makes sure she puts on a wig before the welfare woman comes to visit. Her shifts from speaking sweetly and softly to the visitor to instantly cursing at Precious tell it all. Yet her pain is revealed bitterly in her final scene in the office of the social worker, Ms. Weiss (a completely banal and bland Mariah Carey). Mo'Nique conveys this woman's pain with breathtaking honesty. This final scene makes us see that maybe she wasn't always a monster; that she has been deeply scarred and acts like this out of her own anguish. Does this excuse her actions? We're left feeling something for this woman that maybe we didn't feel before. Mo'Nique's performance is absolutely exquisite.    One word on Mariah Carey's performance: any decent actress could have portrayed this minor role. Casting Carey in this film was a cheap move on the casting director's part in trying to get acclaim and attention. They took a celebrity known for her glamour, removed her makeup and filmed her with a handheld camera; suddenly she's supposed to be a brilliant actress who should be forgiven for that atrocity known as Glitter. Don't be fooled.   Precious is meant to be an emotionally trying experience. However, Geoffrey Fletcher's screenplay hits us overthe head time and time again with tragedy after tragedy. Yes, Precious' life is a tragedy. It's impossible not to feel pity. Positive or negative feelings aside, it is a visceral and tear-jerking film, but for circumstance alone. Fletcher and Daniels should have let us live more with these characters as they were, without feeling the need to stomp on Precious while she's way down.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|Purchasing The Promise was a big step for me. I figured it would just be a remix of the original album with a few studio outtakes thrown in for all the Bruce-a-holics. But this was much, much, more. I would first like to say the the documentary DVD about the making of album is worth the price of the entire package. It gives you a look at this album in a much deeper perspective. Darkness has never been one of my favorite albums, but after seeing the DVD, it gave me a whole new appreciation of it.     The Promise, the 2nd album that was never released, contains some real musical gems.  Come On (Let's Go Tonight), a variation of the song \\"Factory\\", is one of my favorites, and gives us a glimpse into Springsteen's writing process. The tune is that of Factory, but the words are more like Bye Bye Johnny. Another strong tune from this set is \\"The Promise\\". This has always been one of my favorite Springsteen songs, but this version is beautiful.    The DVD of the album performed by the E Street Band in MSG is also phenomenal. Springsteens voice is strong, the songs are still fresh, and you get that sense that this was one of Springsteen's favorite albums to make.    The additional performance DVD's are also quite enjoyable. Seeing a young Springsteen perform is magical, and the films almost take you to one of those 1978 concerts.    All in all, if you love Bruce Springsteen, you'll love this set. If nothing else, the documentary is worth a look, and the \\"Promise\\" CD is a bonus album. Thanks Bruce!

B002PJ4II4|2.0|If it's one thing I can't stand, it's rewriting history. Wozzie may very well be an important figure in the history of personal computing, but certainly no larger than Chuck Peddle (for example). The book contains many incorrect facts about competitors and at times is painful to read. To steal a phrase from Ford Fairlane- it's like masturbating with a cheese grater. Slightly entertaining but mostly painful.    A far better read in this genre is Brian Bagnall's \\"On the Edge: the Spectacular Rise and Fall of Commodore\\", or perhaps the recent rewrite \\"Commodore: A life on the edge\\".
B002RT69QQ|5.0|I was surprised to read all the negative reviews for this little wonder, so I thought I would throw in my two cents...    The BIGGEST PRO that no one talks about: Memory Stick Pro Duo compatibility! I bought this reader to help me transfer pictures and video from an 8Gb Memory Stick PRO DUO (MSPD) (which is a SONY technology and less universal than your standard SD or SDHC format). Its hard to find a good, portable reader for this format, short of dragging your camera along just to access files.     To address the other reviews: Yes, this reader is made of plastic. Yes, it is very low cost. However, I do not feel it is as \\"cheap\\" as others have suggested. It has never had a problem reading any card I give it, and the sliding memory card doors actually add to the appeal for me. I can compact the reader and store it with my camera in the camera's small case. I don't have to carry a cable around to transfer photos whenever I want.    In the long run if you take care of your tech, your tech will take care of you. I have no qualms about suggesting this card reader to anyone. Kingston has my vote!
1400052173|5.0|This book was really really interesting. I'm a lab scientist and learning about these cells was really moving, especially because I know the feeling of not thinking about where the cells I work with come from. This story was really easy to read and the author made it easy for non-scientists to understand as well. Getting to know the characters, even the so called \\"bad\\" ones from the hospitals, was really great, and the book, although a little biased, maintained a more level playing field by interviewing the doctors and their associates as well. I really really recommend this book highly!

0307454541|4.0|I have to admit, I'm an avid social reader, and really don't review most of what I read (if any, up until now).  At first, this novel drove me nuts with countless characters and unfamiliar locations.  It really was tough to keep them all straight.  But I just couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book looking to branch out from the typical thriller authors - James Patterson, Dean Koontz, Lisa Unger, etc.  Stieg Larsson's approach is so fresh and different.  I'm definitely going to include his novels when looking for the next book to read!

0307272702|3.0|First of all, I didn't like the tone of this book. The author writes like he's addressing a bunch of idiots: \\"Now if you pay attention\\" \\"Our friends the psychiatrists\\" \\"I'm going to go over the basics which you may find slow going\\" I-I-I, gee whiz! We may not all be doctors, and some of us may even be fat, but we're not stupid! What really annoyed me was every few sentences, he'd say something like, \\"I'll cover this later,\\" \\"We'll get to this further on,\\" \\"I'll explain this in Chapter 5.\\" It was like trying to follow a lot of broken threads. Of course by the time he covered any of this--if he did--you wouldn't remember anyway.<br /><br />The book really struck me as nothing more than a lot of his opinions, based on historical research, some more than 100 years old. He may be right, but he also may be wrong about a lot of things. It didnt appear to me that he'd done his own research. I am not a health care professional, so I can only base my opinion here on my own experience. It seemed he kept debunking the theory that overeating causes people to gain weight. Overeating at Thanksgiving dinner and then going back to normal eating habits may not do it, but over a period of time it sure will. This summer, I don't know why, I started eating a lot, and a lot of fattening foods, potato chips at lunch, candy bars in the afternoon, desserts every night, second and third helpings. I kept it up for 3 months and yes, I gained weight. I stopped when a cop on an accident report said I weighed 200 pounds. I think he was right. I cut out or cut way back on junk foods and desserts, slashed portion sizes. After another 3 months, I have lost the extra weight I gained. Don't try this at home, but this is what I find: the more you eat, the more you want to eat, and the less you eat the less you want/need to eat. I'm not starving. Another thing I don't agree with is all his generalizations, like poor people are fat, rich people stay thin. Every person is different, and suppose you have two sisters in the same family, the same household, eating at the same table, one is thin and one is fat. How does he explain that? What if two parents have different body types and some kids inherit the mother's genes and some the father's?<br /><br />I realized I had left out something important here. I wasn't following anybody's official diet above, but the fattening foods I was cutting out and cutting down on actually were mostly carbohydrates. I just didn't think of it that way, but the conclusion he comes to seems to be right, at least for me. I can see a lot of people are already disagreeing with me, but I still preferred his first book.<br /><br />What about diets? The reason most of them don't work is they are based on some gimmick and as soon as you go off the diet you gain back the weight you've lost. I can't agree that exercise doesn't help. You may gain weight, since muscle weighs more than fat, but your body does become leaner. How many fat marathon runners are out there? When I was dancing (ballet) years ago five nights a week, I was a lot leaner (yes, I am now overweight). There are other benefits to exercise. I don't agree it makes you hungry. My experience was it took my mind off of food and a light meal, not a heavy one, was what we had after class.<br /><br />Finally, if it's genetic and we're predisposed to be obese, it sounds pretty hopeless. I don't buy that either. I know for a fact I'll never be a size zero, but that won't stop me from making an effort to look good.<br /><br />You can read this book and judge for yourselves. I thought his first book was better (Good Calories, Bad Calories). I don't feel one can go wrong with everything in moderation. And finally, don't judge anyone by their weight. Say something truthful to make the person feel good about themselves, whether they are fat or thin.

B000YIGNKE|3.0|This was the first version of Persuasion I had viewed. I liked it! Though it was a little boring and slow-moving.

B0042JTDXK|2.0|I have all of Josh Groban's CDs, and I truly thought that I would love anything that he did.  I have listened to this CD five times, and try though I might, I just don't like it.  The songs are not powerful...not emotional...and he constantly sings in falsetto, even though he has such a powerful and beautiful voice!  Most of the songs are just okay...pretty dull...and the lyrics to the one about Galileo are so trite as to be almost comical.  There's no flow to the songs.  His previous music really wrapped itself around me with it's incredible tonality and beauty.  This one is almost painful to listen to.  I won't buy any more of his CDs without previewing them.

1594481717|3.0|The author is clearly a leftist (he refers to Pat Buchanan as \\"an ultraconservative fringe candidate\\") and like all leftists he doesn't just misunderstand human nature -- he doesn't understand it at all. A perfect example: he claims IQ accounts for only five percent of a person's success. Apparently he just made that statistic up, because there is no truth to it. Half the people in this country have IQs of less than 100. They are not going to doctors or lawyers or the author's designers. They're going to be blue-collar workers. What are the supposed to do today with corporations (creations of they government) exporting jobs to the Third World? Deliver pizzas? Be security guards? The author did diagnose current problems, but anyone can do that. His prescriptions are worthless -- trendy, feel-good, dangerous nonsense.

0316098337|5.0|Emma Donoghue has created such a fascinating and provocative story inside the pages of her latest book Room that I am loathe to try to review it. Seeing everything from Jack's eyes, I am almost certain I have never truly fallen in love with character until now. Jack is brave and strong and he is scared and this is the most amazing chance for any reader to get lost in rediscovering the world from the eyes of a child.<br /><br />I found myself angry with Jack's Ma in the last third of the book. All he has ever known is her and Room and she becomes increasingly selfish through-out the novel. However I can't say that I would do anything differently if I was in her shoes. So the fact that I was angry with her made me angry at myself and I began to think about the ways I interact with my own children. Am I setting them up for some kind of mental fall out later in life? Those impossible questions that can't be answered until you are slapped with the therapy bills I suppose.<br /><br />Jack is a fantastic narrator, growing up in Room with little to do but read and count he is fantastically ahead with his mental capability for learning. I love his voice, and the way he explains everything in his world to his reader. I love that Dora is his friend inside of Room just like she is the friend of so many children outside of Room.<br /><br />  At 8:30 I press the button on TV and try between the three. I find Dora the Explorer, yippee. Ma moves Bunny around and real slow to better the picture with his ears and head. One day when I was four TV died and I cried, but in the night Old Nick brung a magic converter box to make TV back to life. The other channels after the three are totally fuzzy so we don't watch them because of hurting our eyes, only if there's music we put Blanket over and just listen through the gray of her and shake our booties.<br /><br />  Today I put my fingers on Dora's head for a hug and tell her about my superpowers now I'm five, she smiles. She has the most huge hair that's really like a brown helmet with pointy bits cutted out, it's as big as the rest of her. I sit back on Bed in Ma's lap to watch, I wriggle till I'm not on her pointy bones. She doesn't have many soft bits but they're super soft.<br /><br />So there you can get a great sense of Jack and his narration skills from that quote from early on in the book. As the story progresses and we see the `games' that Ma and Jack play are really Ma trying to get the neighbors to notice them and escape the book becomes a bit harder to read. I have shed many a tear during the reading of Room and it is not a book that I am going to forget any time soon.<br /><br />Thank you Emma Donoghue and Jack for giving me such an amazing gift of a book that will stay with me as time progresses and that made me feel so much.<br /><br />This story is beautiful and haunting and many other adjectives that I could continue piling onto this sentence. Pick up a copy and read I promise you will not be disappointed.uge hair that's really like a brown helmet with pointy bits cutted out, it's as big as the rest of her.

0385738757|5.0|The Scorch Trials picks up from The Maze Runner and starts with an explosion of surprises and plot twists.  The Gladers thought that their hard work surviving The Maze finally brought them peace, but they are far from any sort of peace.  James Dashner does a great job describing the emotions Thomas and The Gladers feel as they cross the futuristic Earth that has been destroyed by The Flare.  A disease by the same name has infected many people including The Gladers.  They are traveling 100 miles to the north crossing the most burnt part of the Earth called The Scorch to receive a cure from WICKED.  WICKED has made sure this will be a challenge though, as only the best candidates for the trial will live and receive the cure. WICKED is not the only one making life hard for The Gladers though.  Cranks, people who have been infected by The Flare, have lost all rationality and sanity and roam about like animals searching for their next meal, which very well could be The Gladers.  WICKED claims that what they are putting The Gladers though will defeat The Flare, yet The Gladers do not see how having innocent people die is solving anything.         This book will have the reader hooked from the first line, \\"She spoke to me before the world fell apart\\" until the very end.  Dashner uses great detail describing all the diverse characters and settings such as the vicious Cranks, the heart-less WICKED scientists, and the Crank-filled, destroyed city.  He also uses heavy detail to make the reader feel the wide variety of emotions The Gladers feel such as  the fear of being killed by The Cranks, the happiness of sleeping in a bed again, the betrayal of learning a new trial is beginning, and the acceptance that WICKED's sick trials may never end.  Dashner throws a new surprise into the plot every second, just as soon as the reader may expect that things are becoming somewhat normal.  The short chapters definitely help significantly with this effect as the chapters always end with some kind of a new plot twist after just reading three pages of the book.  The Scorch Trials is definitely a worthy sequel to a book as great as The Maze Runner and I will definitely be looking forward to the release of the next book of the series!        Logan M.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was VERY surprised to find that this is now one of my favorite series.    My initial opinion of this series couldn't have been more wrong.  I was instantly sucked in, and it didn't let go until I'd finished the third book.    Collin's descriptive skills are wonderful [and oddly subliminal message-like, ever since reading The Hunger Games I've been drinking hot chocolate like crazy, when all my life I've never cared for it].  There are enough genres to please a wide range of tastes, there is a bit of romance, action and adventure, a dash of horror.  The Hunger Games is an absolute page turner.    I reccomend this series to anyone who wants a good read.  This is cliche, but while reading this series, and most especially this book, I laughed and I held my breath at intense moments, and I cried.  I cried like a baby.  And I do so every time I read this.  I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised with this novel, and I've reccommended this to everyone I know.

The book has too many details and descriptions about the characters plus, the events. The setting doesn't change at all and theres only a few new characters. Stephanie Meyer didn't focus that much on this book and she hardly has any action scenes to keep the reader entertained. Most of the book is just in the Cullen's house and the storyline is the same as the other books in the series because they all have a main point. The book is just telling the readers what happens to Bella when she gets pregnant and then becomes a vampire. At the beginning its telling readers that Bella is preparing for the wedding then on the honeymoon she gets knock up. Then in the middle of the book its telling readers that Bella is starting to have her baby and the only way to save her is to turn her into a vampire. Later on in the book Bella gets furious at Jacob because he imprints on Nessie ( nickname that Jacob gave to Bella's daughter). Near the end of the book the Cullen's and others try to reason with the Volturi's.                            By Damon M.
0743243153|2.0|Sections on Love and Discipline I found very interesting and to some degree enlightening.  However, I had a few problems with this book.<br /><br />1. On page 61 - the section on Discipline - Peck recalls a male patient that expressed homosexual tendencies.  His advice to that patient - date a woman. My next thought, \\"Is this guy a homophobe? Why didn't he explore the possibility that his patient could genuinely be gay and might successfully and happily live as a gay man?\\" ..but I continued to read.<br />2. Peck seems to brag about himself as a psychotherapist, A LOT. I found this annoying and could not understand how this aspect of the book was useful except to attempt to convince the reader of how great he is... but I continued to read.<br />3. Page 175.  Is this guy serious?????

Immediatly after watching this movie, my son who is of 13 years old asked me that he wants to learn Graphics.    In Disc 2, it explains well how Graphics supported the parts of the movie shooted.    Overall I am very much happy about my purchase, I am recommending this package to everyone who loves to watch movies.
0399536108|4.0|This book certainly reads as a pocket manifesto and it certainly inspires in the same way also. Those who are curious about this book should make the purchase. It's the perfect book to read at the beginning and end of each day. Inspiring stuff.
B000K4WPCC|5.0|I have watched a many \\"B\\" movies and was pleasently surprised with this one. The fight scenes were good but my favorite special effect scene was when he went head on into the truck. The lead actor is so gorgeous you really don't see any bad acting. I read the reviews before i bought this movie and they spoke of homoeroticism, but I can't say i saw the homoerotic reference. The lead in the movie had a \\"HOT\\" makeout scene in his sports car and Pogue (another cutie) had a girl friend that he did some deep kissing in the beginning. I did enjoy this movie and will watch a sequel if one is in the making.

0765350386|5.0|Sanderson's first entry in the Mistborn trilogy is quite remarkable. Having never truly gotten into The Wheel of Time, I first read Sanderson's newest book, The Way of Kings and found myself wanting more. Book 1 of the trilogy is absolutely riveting, creating a sense of suspense and urgency with its brisk pacing and unpredictable plot. A well crafted magic system that surrounds an ominous world and truly genuine characters all form together to weave an Ocean's 11-esque caper around an epic fantasy. While Sanderson's Final Empire lacks the grit and intensity of one's such as Martin's Song of Ice and Fire, it's emotional punch compensates quite nicely. Anyone picking up this book should be hardpressed to stop reading before they finish The Hero of Ages, Sanderson's equally impressive conclusion to this unique series.
1439177783|5.0|The book was excellant. I recommened it to everyone. Amazing to think someone so beautiful could see themself in such a terrible way. Shows how powerful the illness(eating disorders has on the human soul. Wonderful to see how her life has changed and how happy she seems to be. i give it a thumbs up!!!!
0765356139|5.0|The Second installment of the Mistborn trilogy is an excellent book. While it suffers from the same fate of nearly all series, the specifics of the world still manage to feel fresh. Sanderson takes this book and broadens the scope of the plot, placing the newly formed regime within Luthadel in a precarious position, between three armies. While the plot is still complex, some of the urgency is lacking, as much of this entry is spent observing each characters moral dillemas. While Vin remains a truly awesome heroine, her coming of age is more frustrating than satisfying. Despite these issues, The Well of Ascension remains on par with its predecessor. Still unpredicatble and unrelenting, the middle book sets up the trilogy for a spectacular concluding chapter. While slower than the first, I never once felt myself wishing that the book would end.
B001FB55HQ|4.0|Like many Terminator fans, I was highly skeptical of this film's genuineness. After all, when films change hands, many times the real flow gets lost in the other director's point of view or a prematurely finished film. \\"Salvation\\" surprisingly doesn't stray too far from what I would call the genuineness of the storyline. A few spots make you cringe a bit because the lines \\"come with me if you want to live\\" and \\"there's no fate by what we make\\" are regurgitated in the film. However even though the first half was hard to get into, by the time the movie is 3/4 done, you are sucked in completely. This is not anything like the other Terminator movies, as it is based in the present, not in the past...and it's more of a sci-fi war film than a story-based sci-fi thriller.<br /><br />The appearance of the Arnold-looking T-800 towards the end nails it down. The first T-800 appears, and it immediately hones in on John Connor. It is indestructable and incredibly merciless. A wonderful foreshadowing of the human-cyborg terminators.<br /><br />Details are well-scripted, even to the very detail of John Connor's face getting scarred by the Terminator's nails (compare his scars in Terminator 2 at the beginning, when Commander John Connor is lowering his binoculars). The rescue of young Kyle Reese was wonderful, but the introduction of Kyle made him look like a street rat who steals things and vandalizes. All with his little black kid side kick.<br /><br />I would have appreciated a little more depth, a way to get to know the characters better so you can really connect. This is obviously missing when compared to the work of Cameron in the first two installments.<br /><br />Story-wise this film is incredible. Compared to the other Terminator films however I was expecting more. It always seems that it would be the new director's point of view on how it really should be.<br /><br />I think the new director did a good job on this film. Kudos.
0984334904|5.0|Okay so I haven't actually started using these cards to study Kanji with just yet (my plans are to begin in 2011) but I am most impressed with how well they appear to be made and how well (at least in my opinion) they seemed to be laid out.  I had another set of Kanji cards awhile back but when I got this set I could tell right away they were going to be much easier for me to use so I actually gave my other set away.  This is not a knock on the product at all, but I just wish they'd make a companion set of cards featuring the Kanji compounds they have listed on each card as an additional study aid - as it is I'll probably make my own but that's just a personal preference of mine.  All in all I think this will be a pretty good learning tool for those who have a basic grasp of Japanese.
0374158460|2.0|As I was driving to work this morning, it finally occurred to me exactly what's been bugging me so much about this novel. Simply put, it's Patty. She's completely unbelievable in the life choices she's made. A competitive college athlete is a very specific kind of person. Especially a female competitive athlete. Franzen paints her as the kind of person whose biggest aspiration is to become the perfect housewife and mother. Really? REALLY?! A girl who's been fighting to be number one all her life, who spent her free time as a kid practicing her jump shot, who became the go-to team leader on her college team? SHE becomes a resentful Stepford wife when she suffers a career-ending injury? I don't buy it. She would never lose that drive to succeed in a competitive world, whether it was sports, business, whatever. It's just completely wrong. I just can't get past it.     Loved The Corrections. Freedom is a miss.

B00402FGE4|1.0|I can't imagine what the makers of this show were thinking.  Why they felt ditching everything that made Stargate SG-1 and (mostly) Stargate Atlantis such a joy to watch is beyond me.  SG-1 had action, friendship, heroism, humor, sacrifice, and characters you could root for; this show has a ship-full of unpleasant, disfunctional, self-absorbed losers (except for the nurse) that made me glad they were on a ship millions of miles away and heading away from Earth.  The gratuitous sex scenes only serve to broadcast the fact that the underlying (no pun intended) product is so poor that viewers have to be occasionally distracted and titillated.  The sooner this show is scrapped the better; don't waste your money on the DVD's.
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|It was exactly like what I expect, it's such a nice tool to attach any external screen that support HDMI input.
B003NFM3JK|3.0|I was expecting to dislike this film. The trailers for it made it seem like sugar-coated ephemera with little relation to Charles Dickens' original novella. Thankfully, the publicity was misleading. Dickens' subtitle for his tale was \\"A Ghost Story.\\" And indeed he filled his prose with deliciously grotesque descriptions of London's dark alleyways (think Jack the Ripper's Whitechapel), a brooding sense that Scrooge has long been due his comeuppance, and, of course, the ghosts themselves. This film doesn't shy away from these darker elements of the story and perhaps comes closer than any other version to capturing its suspense. (The one exception is the classic 1951 [[ASIN:B000SR0DDE Scrooge]], directed by Brian Desmond Hurst and starring Alistair Sim, with its atmospheric black-and-white cinematography.) On one hand, this is a plus for fans of the book. On the other hand, as with 2007's [[ASIN:B00005JPL5 Bridge to Terabithia]], parents unfamiliar with the source material may be misled into thinking the film is lighter than it actually is, resulting in much disgruntlement. I fall into the former category and was able to relish the film as a genuine ghost story. Unfortunately, I found the film's stylistic and cinematic finesse often came at the expense of narrative depth.     The title sequence displays Zemeckis' eye for detail. He quite effectively evokes the Dickensian London: dirty, mean, teeming with life and social inequity. This is no idealized, picturesque Christmas town, but a city in the midst of an Industrial Revolution. Once the dialogue ensued, I was pleased to see the script was not watered-down for younger viewers, but borrows liberal chunks of Dickens' prose. Nuances in the text left out of other versions are presented here. We also see, for instance, Bob Cratchit \\"[go] down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys... in honour of its being Christmas Eve\\" and how \\"the fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of [Scrooge's] house, that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold.\\"     The performance capture cinematography itself can be quite stunning. Zemeckis' intention seems to have been to bring to life the classic illustrations of John Leech and Arthur Rackham as opposed to straight realism. The result is somewhat uneven. While some of the character designs seem strikingly realistic, others (like Scrooge himself) are exaggerated caricatures. It takes some time to adjust to this half-realistic, half-illustration approach. Jim Carrey's performance (as Scrooge and all three ghosts) is impressive in its range and ability to convey subtext. At points I feel he's let down by his age (or lack of it) when his voice doesn't quite convey the gravitas of years of loneliness. At other points, elements of his shtick poke through in Scrooge's face and mannerism. Although such moments break up the heaviness of much of the film, it sometimes seems anachronistic. Overall, however, he lends genuine depth and pathos to Scrooge and mirth with a slight undertone of grim seriousness to the Ghost of Christmas Present.     One misstep in the design is Jacob Marley's Ghost, which I found more hokey than frightening. Gary Oldman's voice performance is certainly no patch on the hair-raising portrayals of Michael Hordern (1951) or Frank Finlay (opposite George C. Scott in the brilliant [[ASIN:B0006419KA 1984 television version]]). But the three Spirits of Christmas are imaginatively done. This may just be the first time the Ghost of Christmas Past has been depicted as Dickens described him, dunce cap and all. The Ghost of Christmas Present's aging is quite effective, evoking elements of symbolism lacking in other versions. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come gets an interesting treatment, emerging out of Scrooge's own shadow. Also of special note is the musical score by Alan Silvestri which incorporates traditional Christmas carols at key moments. At points, the music can be a little overwrought, insisting too emphatically that the audience notice aspects of the unfolding drama that might be better accompanied by silence, but generally Silvestri alternates between festive buoyancy and ghostly suspense quite effectively.      All that said, the film unfortunately wastes a lot of time on gratuitous scenes that do nothing to advance Dickens' story and exist solely to justify the 3D experience for moviegoers. I wouldn't have a problem with this (the scenes are thrilling enough on my moderately large HDTV; I can imagine they'd be amazing on the big screen in 3D), except that these scenes often come at the expense of narrative. As faithful as the screenplay is in places, a lot of good material is sacrificed for scenes in which Scrooge is flying, falling, or fleeing for no apparent reason. The most conspicuous is one other reviewers have mentioned: a large chunk of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come sequence is devoted to a scene in which Scrooge is chased by a black hearse. On one hand, this underscores the fact that Scrooge does not have many Christmases left. On the other hand, the scene was several minutes long and wastes valuable time that could have been spent on a touching moment from the book in which Bob Cratchit mentions having met Scrooge's nephew Fred at Tiny Tim's grave site. The result? The characterization loses out much of the time to the visuals. The scenes depicting Ebenezer's past and fall into his present miserly loneliness and those featuring the Cratchit family at home, for instance, feel much less developed than in other versions. Tiny Tim himself, the subject of much anxiety and affection in the original novella, gets almost no treatment here at all beyond his obligatory \\"God bless us, everyone.\\"    This lack of characterization is what prevents this version and Carrey's Scrooge, impressive and insightful as it is, from becoming as iconic as Sim or Scott or Patrick Stewart in his [[ASIN:0743563794 one-man audio version]] oreven Michael Caine in [[ASIN:B000ATQYT2 the surprisingly faithful Muppet version]]. With all the attention paid to the stunning 3D effects, Carrey's Scrooge doesn't get the opportunity to be fleshed out into all of its three dimensions. Less time devoted to scenes extraneous to the action and more devoted to the preliminary damning and ultimate reclamation of his soul (the terms in which Dickens described this story), and we could had something more substantial. It's definitely not a lost opportunity. What's here is engaging and often gripping, but I didn't get the sense of catharsis I had with more dialogue-driven (as opposed to visual-driven) versions of the work. If Amazon would let me, I'd rate it 3.5 stars.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|This is a film my wife and watch several times over the years. Absolutely one of Matt Damon's best film series...
B0040JHWKS|5.0|Back in the `70s, any recording artist worth his or her salt was expected to release an album per year, every two years tops. If there were a lapse in this rote  pattern, the record company would put out a \\"greatest hits,\\" or some type of \\"best of\\" compilation to appease hungry fans. Everybody thought Dylan was finished when there was no follow-up to \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" in 1967, and after an unheard of three-year lull in Van Morrison's recording career, Van the Man released an LP with the apparently explanatory title \\"A Period of Transition.\\"<br /><br />I remember the seemingly endless barren stretch that followed \\"Born to Run\\" (was Springsteen not \\"Rock and Roll Future\\" after all? my friends and I wondered aloud), and it would be years before I found out Bruce had actually written and recorded several songs in the limbo between his 1975 epic and 1978's \\"Darkness On the Edge of Town.\\" Now, three decades later, this material is finally, officially, seeing the light of day.<br /><br />\\"The Promise\\" is best appreciated not as a fully realized whole like \\"Born to Run\\" or \\"Darkness,\\" but as a transitional journey between the two, from the wide-eyed optimism of the former, when Bruce believed (and we did right along with him) that Rock and Roll was bigger than life, to the harder-edged latter, forged by the trials and stresses of an increasingly imposing real world. It makes for an engrossing, sometimes downright intoxicating mix, and serves as a welcome, long lost bridge between two masterpieces seemingly half a world apart. It's also, to me, an invigorating reminder of why I became a Bruce fan in the first place.<br /><br />And it's a tribute to the Boss that he could produce such a vast storehouse of great songs--some of which (\\"Because the Night,\\" \\"Fire,\\" \\"Talk to Me,\\" et al.) provided success for other artists--and withhold them from release simply because they didn't fit the overall concept, the Big Picture,  of the LP he was determined to make. Or, in some cases, as he recently mentioned on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, he didn't want to be perceived as a \\"revivalist\\" or to put out an album that \\"wore its influences on its sleeve.\\" This strict adherence to his forward-looking vision was our loss for several decades (save for the resulting \\"Darkness\\" album, of course), and has now, finally, been remedied to the benefit of all.<br /><br />There are some shimmeringly beautiful tracks here that hearken back to \\"Born to Run,\\" of which Sprinsteen has said he wanted to make \\"the greatest rock and roll record ever.\\" A number of these lush mini epics bring to mind a line from a review of Neil Young's \\"Live Rust,\\" written by Tom Carson some 30 years ago: \\"It's so massively stately that you get the feeling of huge mountains on the move.\\" And we get a feeling of just how important Springsteen's then-recent influences were to him, as well.<br /><br />As for wearing them \\"on its sleeve,\\" well, perhaps there was the fear at the time that those influences were too recent and recognizable. Whatever the case, they have since aged gracefully, and to anyone born after, say, 1970, these songs' inspirations are likely to be all but invisible. Nevertheless, the giants on whose shoulders Bruce stood were among the tallest. There's the euphoric, Spectorian wall of sound of \\"The Little Things (My Baby Does)\\" and the glorious \\"Gotta Get That Feeling.\\" Mighty Max channels Jerry Allison in the Buddy Holly inspired \\"Outside Looking In.\\" \\"Someday (We'll Be Together)\\" conjures up the Four Seasons' \\"Rag Doll.\\"  \\"Breakaway\\" is steeped in Orbison-like majesty. The rhythmic rawness of Gary \\"U.S.\\" Bonds permeates \\"Ain't Good Enough For You.\\" The horn arrangements on \\"It's a Shame\\" hearken back to the Stax/Volt Memphis Horns. \\"One Way Street\\" brings to mind Percy Sledge's soul classic \\"True Love Travels On a Gravel Road,\\" which was covered by Elvis, for whom Bruce wrote \\"Fire.\\" Come to think of it, this is the music that made me fall in love with Rock and Roll inthe first place, before Bruce even came on the scene.<br /><br />On the \\"Darkness\\" side of the coin is an alternate take of \\"Racing In the Street,\\" \\"Come On (Let's Go Tonight),\\" which was the forerunner of both \\"Factory\\" and \\"Johnny Bye Bye,\\" \\"Wrong Side of the Street,\\" \\"The Promise,\\" and \\"Candy's Boy,\\" which obviously morphed into \\"Candy's Room.\\"<br /><br />It's all good, but two songs, to my ears, stand above the rest. \\"Rendezvous\\" actually gave me goose bumps upon hearing it for the first time--something that, at my age, hasn't happened in quite awhile.

B001IXSU8M|1.0|This is a great example of how pop music is progressing further and further away from intelligence and closer to consumer bliss.

B0032JTV6U|5.0|My husband and I are total fans of \\"Glee\\".  We have been in music and singing in groups since high school.  We especially enjoy episodes that feature a remix of classic rock, our \\"old music!\\"  Even though we are from a different generation music has been our lives.  We also enjoy the story line.  My husband is a high school teacher and I am recently retired.  Even though the storyline may be a little tongue in cheek sometimes the issues are very real and the feelings portrayed are very real.  The episodes on Kurt's bullying were particularly well done (and sad)  Some of these reviews complain of the music getting more attention than the plot. In our opinion the focus is perfect balance.  Music brings people together and provides relief from real life challenges, sorrows and hopelessness.
B00436GNVC|4.0|I loved Duffy's \\"Rockferry\\" album and eagerly anticipated the release of \\"Endlessly.\\" While it's a solid album, it just didn't wow me the way \\"Rockferry\\" did. The songs are all okay (except for the weird \\"Keeping My Baby,\\" which is reminiscent of Madonna's \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" from way back when), and Duffy sounds great, but none of the tracks really grabbed me the way \\"Warwick Avenue\\" and \\"Rockferry\\" did. I also don't think Duffy got to showcase her amazing vocal talents as much as she did on her first album. She doesn't go off and wail in any of the songs or hit those insane notes she can do. It's kind of disappointing...still a good CD, but I was expecting much more.

0143118420|5.0|In so many negative reviews I've read, everyone seems to be so cynical and I don't get it. Is the author self-absorbed? If she is, then we all are. Who doesn't think about how life affects them personally?  The book is taking you through her mindset which I appreciate because I can relate to a lot of the thoughts she has. All she was trying to do is help other people know that they are not alone in struggling with the inner conflict of finding balance in their lives. Granted I agree that most people can't afford to pick up and live abroad for a year without working, but that's why she brings her experiences to the reader. This book caused me to think about life from a different perspective and that isn't something that's easy for me, being the self-absorbed loner that I am. So I give kudos to Liz Gilbert. Anyone else that read this book and was tired of her crying and blah, blah, blah, you missed the point of the book by a longshot and I hope that one day you get it.

B002BWP4A6|5.0|This film is a brutal journey into the heart of a mystery, leaving the ultimate truth to be decided by viewer.  It is in the best tradition of a Bertolt Brecht play, designed to leave the viewer in a state of conflict at the end to stimulate discussion, introspection, and possibly action.  If you expect anything neat or tied off, it isn't there.<br /><br />The film begins with the narrator, a gentle and sensitive man who was the village teacher, announcing that he will tell a story he both witnessed and attempted to put together by his own inquiry.  He also tells his own love story, which is the only thing of true beauty in the film.<br /><br />What he wishes to understand and explain is a series of bizarrely violent incidents that occurred just prior to the outbreak of WW I.  First, a man is injured by a fall from his horse, then horrible punishments are visited upon certain children.  Then, as events progress, the workings of the village families are revealed, from shockingly brutal parental attitudes to crimes, but also much tenderness and caring.  Finally, the village and its power relationships are examined as if it were an ecosystem or organism, adding an additional level of possible explanation to the events that are increasingly horrifying to everyone.  The narrator at last is forced to confront his suspicions and goes directly to what he feels is the source.  However, he is denounced for his efforts and threatened - the forces of denial are too great for him to uncover anything decisively.  The outbreak of the war then changes everything.<br /><br />I believe the theme of the film is fanaticism and its relation to isolated fundamentalism.  At least in the beginning, the crimes appeared to me to be motivated as punishments of those who are not living up to some standard or belief system, but it quickly moves beyond that.  The source of the violence is the rage that simmers at the heart of a stagnant society, feeding on itself while finding a justification to express it from its own parochialism.  It is a mistake, I think, to label this as a simple German phenomenon or blatant precursor to fascism, though this thought will occur to any observer; it is instead a comment on a basic and very ugly human tendency, to create and punish evil as they chose to define it.<br /><br />Finally, this is not typical whodunnit that moves quickly like a Hitchcock film.  It is slow, almost lyrical, as it portrays the way people behave, which reflects what is inside of them.  The discovery of a conspiracy, if there was one, builds in momentum only to dissipate as the country mobilizes for war.  The magic is in the portraits of individuals, who are perfectly cast actors, in particular the many children.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  This is a deep and disturbing film that never relies on cheap shocks or glib dismissals of mystery.  I loved it and will want to watch it many times.own parochialism.

Finally, this is not typical whodunnit that moves quickly like a Hitchcock film.  It is slow, almost lyrical, as it portrays the way people behave, which reflects what is inside of them.  The discovery of a conspiracy, if there was one, builds in momentum only to dissipate as the country mobilizes for war.  The magic is in the portraits of individuals, who are perfectly cast actors, in particular the many children.    Warmly recommended.  This is a deep and disturbing film that never relies on cheap shocks or glib dismissals of mystery.  I loved it and will want to watch it many times.
B002ZG99A4|2.0|The Expendables is an idea. A supposed embodiment of machismo heralded by great action stars of the past present, and in alternate universes, and a symphony of gunfire and explosions.<br /><br />This is just an idea. This movie is false advertising. It's movie that when describing it, you use words like \\"more\\" and \\"less\\" to describe everything. There is simply very little, or very brief moment of the film getting something right. For example, a good scene where some baddie is getting their hand cut off, or a good scene of somebody getting blown away by a shot gun. But these moments never translate into anything more. They don't extend to make fully memorable action sequences. Instead you comments like, Less dialogue, more action. Less Dolph Lundgren, more Jason Statham. Also, it could have used a better story. You know, the type that isn't driven on Stallone's liking for this one random girl. The type that isn't forced to go to the bad guy's island in the middle of the movie by calling it \\"scouting it out,\\" when really they just didn't have a better excuse to get some action in. The type that just isn't generally punctuated by god-awful writing, the type where you get to the point of tuning out of the movie and getting popcorn or a drink or something when something isn't immediately blowing up.<br /><br />Overall, even though I rented The Expendables on Blu-Ray, I still felt a bit cheated. I liked Jason Statham, I liked some of the action, but most everything in-between was a complete and utter bore. Some people will feel the action and the sheer amount of nostalgia hanging around will make it all worth it, but no matter how you slice it or dice it, the film hanging around its idea is bad.
0553582038|1.0|Apparently there is no longer any such thing as an editor in Fantasy. At this rate, I will be dead and Martin before me long before this series concludes. If you don't believe me look up Richard Jordan. In an attempt to introduce verisimilitude in the way of character development and complexity, the \\"Wheel of Time\\" series was twice as long winded and twice as bad as it should have been and was, surprise, never finished.<br /><br />Is this the result of a contract dispute Martin has with his publisher? Is it boredom? It certainly speaks to a lack of professionalism as a writer. You might as well start hiring writers to finish the series right now and maybe introduce Conan into it as long as your at it cuz this one is finished right now.<br /><br />Men will be on Mars by the time a seventh volume is written. Martin may be the only writer, who also writes science fiction, whose SF would be out of date by the time he actually finished an SF series because of making a life's work out of it. I can see such a man writing about what men found on the moon in a series started around 1950 and wrapping up in 1975 and becoming obsolete at the printer's.<br /><br />If this series had been about fantasy conventions it would have been done a long time ago.
B004FDPOHC|4.0|For this soundtrack, don't think 80s, One More Time, or a new soundtrack masterpiece to cap off an already amazing year. No, think Inception-Lite, then add in some electronic beats. By Inception-Lite, I mean the music between soundtracks is kind of interchangeable, but there's clearly a more quality winner here. In fact, much of the soundtrack barrows from the Hans Zimmer school of thinking, not just the certain horn structure that was so infamously from Inception (The Game has Changed), but the strings, how the strings are arranged, the moods given off, etc. Granted, I know the soundtrack was composed before Inception ever came out, but the whole thing sounds very Zimmer-Esque.<br /><br />Why is this? Well, the soundtrack may be \\"by\\" Daft Punk, but Joseph Trapanese did much of the orchestrations, with only the guidance of Daft Punk. Daft themselves did the electronic work. As a result, the work sounds very much like a modern soundtrack. But since Zimmer holds the example of the modern soundtrack currently in my mind, it sounds very derivitive of that for me. Not that this is a bad thing per say, but the entire score does hold an ever-present feeling of familiarity. It's mixed up by the electronic elements of course, which sound something straight out of a future nightclub, complete with weird DJ stuff, drumbeats and other tricks of the Daft Punk trade. Still, it doesn't sound amazing enough to stand on its own.<br /><br />Another thing I must bring about is the theme. You know, the one introduced in the first track as a grandiose piece, comes back for a couple tracks at the beginning, then starting back with \\"Arrival,\\" dominates the rest of the proceedings. It's a rather simple horn piece, and it's used to great effect, but if feels like it also uses it as a crutch much too often. Introduction moment. Bring in the theme. Action moment. Bring in the theme. Emotional moment. Bring in the theme. Triumphant moment. Bring in the theme. End credits. Bring in the theme, remixed by Daft Punk. You see my point? It's a great and memorable theme, but it's a bit too simple to be as used as often as it is.<br /><br />Overall, Tron Legacy the soundtrack is not bad. It's a solid effort, but suffers from the stark feeling of familiarity wherever you go. Did it really take them two years to compose this? Still it's a must-have for soundtrack fans, and if it draws in non-soundtrack fans, then I'm fine with that too.<br /><br />One thing I'll say though, if the soundtrack's job was to make you want to see the movie, then they certainly accomplished that.<br /><br />3.5/5 Starsunk.

B000EUDAWG|1.0|I bought this RC Tarantula for my daughter's 11th birthday.  The Tarantula is very cool looking, but we were so disappointed that the remote control would not light up or work, even with new batteries. We didn't even order a replacement, because we thought it would be just as cheap and would probably not work.  It's too bad, because this could be a fun toy!

B00003CX9Q|5.0|This is a great 2 disc collector's edition.  It comes with 1982 original movie release version and the updated 2002 version.  So if you like the new CG special effects or the original which won the hearts of millions of people just the way it is; the choice is yours.  Personally, I don't mind seeing ET run through the forest with just a red light on a track.  As a kid, I still believed it was ET running.  Seeing the new CG version of ET running reminded me of Jar Jar.  It was more distracting than believable.  Either way, both versions are good to have because the new one has some never before scenes not originally release in the 1982 version.  So that was fun to look at.
0446569909|4.0|Everybody knows Ozzy Osbourne in one way or another -- classic satanic rocker, burned-out family man, or whatever.<br /><br />So he tries to incorporate a little of everything in \\"I Am Ozzy,\\" a rough'n'tumble autobiography full of all the embarrassing, unflattering, sometimes bizarre details of his life. It takes awhile to get used to his rambling style, but these stories have an unpolished brand of charm... and he's undoubtedly had an interesting life.<br /><br />John \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne was born into a working-class, impoverished British family, had a miserable stint at school, and seemed destined for \\"manual labor or manual labor.\\" Instead, he went to prison.<br /><br />Fortunately for Black Sabbath fans, that isn't where the story ends. After hearing the Beatles and Fleetwood Mac, he became enamored of the rock'n'roll life... albeit a darker, weirder side than the hippie-dippie stuff that was popular at the time. And after a few failed bands, he got into a true, brilliant band that was later named Black Sabbath, hated by critics and much beloved by music fans.<br /><br />He got married, had sex with groupies (in that order), went on Top of the Pops, encountered satanic freakfans, and produced a slew of albums with Black Sabbath. Lots of booze and drugs. As you'd expect, both he and the band started spiralling out of control. But after quitting it, he got involved with his future second wife Sharon, and launched out on a new life of music, madness, sex, dove-biting, bat-biting and -- most horribly -- reality TV.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't much care for \\"I Am Ozzy\\" during the first few chapters. The combination of a misspent youth and Osbourne's rambling style gave me a bit of a headache. But after awhile, his life story starts to grow on you -- his stories became funnier and more bizarre (how he almost killed a vicar with a hash cake) and his meandering way of recounting the past begins to flow more easily.<br /><br />And since this is Ozzy Osbourne, he's got a LOT of freaky stories, so the book feels like sitting down and listening to the old guy natter about the Bad Ol' Days. Some are filthy, some are crazy, and some are just plain hilarious (`There's this incredible new thing. It's American and it's called pizza!\\"). And he writes in a rough-hewn, unpretentious style that meanders all over the place, but has charm.<br /><br />Of course, it's got the F-word sprinkled through it hundreds and hundreds of times. What else would you expect?<br /><br />And to his credit, Osbourne is unafraid to admit to the uglier parts of his life -- he was a burglar, he fired shotguns at small animals, and he cheated on Wife #1, as well as other sundry regrets. He's also pleasantly down-to-earth about his music, even when people didn't like it or didn't get it (\\"Are you sure they didn't make a mistake, son?\\" \\"What d'you mean?\\" \\"This cross is upside down\\").<br /><br />It took a little while to grow on me, but \\"I Am Ozzy\\" ends up being an R-rated funride through the nasty world of rock and drugs -- the good, the bad, and the really gross.e sitting down and listening to the old guy natter about the Bad Ol' Days.

159448385X|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is one of those books that you can't let go of. This is a great great book for people interested in war stories. This book took it to a different perspective it is coming from a victim. This book is really eye opening to the real world, sad at parts, but overall super aswome. It starts out with a young 15 year old girl called Mariam who gets married to a 60 year old man and ends up being in an abusive relationship. This is the basic storyline, but the real story is what happens during the marriage. Great Read!

B004B32532|5.0|After over 20 years, Severin Films announces the release of Alejandro Jodorowsky's internationally acclaimed 'SANTA SANGRE'. The 1989 production, rarely seen since its U.S. theatrical release, comes to Blu-ray and DVD featuring a restored print of the film's European version as well as 5 hours of Bonus Material.<br /><br />Jodorowsky exploded onto the international scene in the early 70's with his bizarre sensations 'EL TOPO' and 'HOLY MOUNTAIN'. Endorsed by John Lennon, who released 'EL TOPO's soundtrack on the Beatles Apple label, and embraced by underground culture worldwide, these films redefined movies as both art and entertainment while almost single-handedly creating the 'midnight movie' genre. Legal frustrations with the films' owner (and Beatles' disreputable manager) Allen Klein, as well as a failed attempt to direct a 14-hour movie adaptation of `Dune' starring Orson Welles and Salvador Dali, kept Jodorowsky from making films for 16 years until his triumphant return with 'SANTA SANGRE'.<br /><br /> Blanca Guerra, Guy Stockwell and the filmmaker's sons Axel and Adan Jodorowsky star in this surreal epic about a young circus performer, the crime of passion that shatters his soul, and the macabre journey back to the world of his armless mother, tattooed-strongman father and deaf-mute lover. \\"This is a movie like none I have seen before,\\" wrote Roger Ebert in his original four-star review, \\"a wild kaleidoscope of images and outrages, a collision between Freud and Fellini.\\" It contains blood and glory, saints and sinners, drug addicts and dealers, pimps and prostitutes, side-show freaks and the disenfranchised, circuses and churches, the pious and the perverse, as well as other unspeakable secrets of the night. And it's delivered to us wrapped in a parade of bold and flamboyant imagery, with Alejandro Jodorowsky as the circus ringmaster. SANTA SANGRE is a movie in which the inner chambers of the soul are laid bare.<br />A bizarre love triangle turns deadly when a circus strongman, Orgo, is caught fooling around with a tattooed woman by his wife, Concha, an aerial performer. Incensed, Concha throws acid on him, and Orgo retaliates by sawing off her arms before killing himself. All of this transpires before the eyes of their young son, Fenix (Adan Jodorowsky), who goes insane and is sent to an institution.<br />Years later, Fenix (now portrayed by Axel Jodorowsky, Adan's older brother, in a fantastic performance) is rescued by his armless mother and returns to the circus. Embittered by the tragic events, Concha now plans revenge, but needs assistance from her emotionally broken son. Violence spawns more violence in this terrifying, color-saturated psychedelic and unforgettable film by a master visionary who is worthy of more recognition than he's ever received. Maybe now?<br /><br />Bonus Features on the Blu-ray and two-disc DVD include deleted scenes, domestic and international trailers, an audio commentary with Jodorowsky, multiple documentaries, new on-camera interviews with the majority of the film's cast and crew, and the 81-year-old Chilean-born filmmaker/playwright/graphic artist/shaman.<br />This film must be seen several times to be believed - I have never viewed a nightmare brought to life with such conviction, beauty or perversity., Orgo, is caught fooling around with a tattooed woman by his wife, Concha, an aerial performer.

B002ZG99N6|5.0|I have always thought that Ben Affleck's acting skills are mediocre at best.  When watching most of his films, my thought would often turn to how the film in question could have been elevated with someone else in the role.  That was certainly the case when I saw \\"State of Play\\", in which Russell Crowe acted circles around him, or so I thought.      But then I watched \\"Gone Baby Gone\\", and started to think that maybe Mr. Affleck's real talent lies behind the camera, not in front of it.  \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" was a taut, suspenseful thriller that kept me guessing until the end.  And with \\"The Town\\", Mr. Affleck has proven that he knows his way behind a camera and that his directorial debut was no fluke.    \\"The Town\\" takes place in the seedy underbelly of Boston, where the central character Doug McRay has lived his whole life and where he spends his spare time planning and executing bank robberies.  At the beginning of the film, Doug and gang succeeds in robbing a bank (in rubber masks) but ends up taking the bank manager (Clare) hostage as insurance against the police.  Even though they released her a short time later, it was soon found out that she actually lived only a few blocks from where Doug and gang lived and hung out.  Thinking that he may have seen her around the neighborhood and that she may have recognized him, Doug staged a \\"chance meeting\\" with her in order to find out what she knows and ends up developing a romantic relationship with her.  To complicate matters further, his best friend Jem is growing increasingly unstable and have become a loose cannon, shooting people and engaging in other sorts of violence acts without the situation calling for it.  With the FBI closing in on them, the woman he likes just one step away from discovering the truth about him, and a friend whose unpredictible behavior may put a lot of people in jeopardy, what is a man to do?      From the surface, \\"The Town\\" is an old-fashioned cop drama that we have all see a million times before.  What elevates it from the masses, however, is the solid acting, the character-focused plot, and the clean, well-shot action sequences.  This may very well be the best performance I've seen Ben Affleck given, and his supporting cast is equally solid.  The film boasts of several exciting action sequences, and these were all staged in a way that brought a refreshingness and new perspective to what can otherwise be stale material.  Mr. Affleck also understood the importance of creating 3 dimensional characters that the audience can care about; and it is because you care about what happens to these people that you will be kept on the edge of your seat as the plot unfolds on the screen.  Plotwise, the story may be cliched, but the way in which this film was put together certainly was not.      With \\"Gone Baby Gone\\", Mr. Affleck has proven that he knows his way behind a camera.  With \\"The Town\\", it is obvious that he has further improved on his craft.  He is no Martin Scorsee, but when it comes to making films with exciting action and likable characters, he is not too shabby...not too shabby at all.
0451457994|3.0|Earlier this year I made a vow to read all of the Space Odyssey books before 2010 rolled around, because it is the year the sequel to 2001 is named after and I needed a kick in the pants to read the series. I'm glad I did. I'm a big fan of hard science fiction, where all of the futuristic content can be backed up by solid science or speculation on future technologies. In the late Sixties no one was in a better position to write this book than Clarke. I enjoyed the book greatly for this reason, he knows his material and it shows. If you aren't interested in the minutiae of Lagrange points or the details of how space travel works you should steer clear of this book (maybe use it's gravity to slingshot in a faster trajectory around it). There are two main plots and sources of drama: the Monolith and its mysterious masters and the tragic tale of HAL 9000. Some people get hung up on one or the other in trying to decide if it's Frankenstein in Space or some heretical book questioning the Creation myth and most modern religions. It is both and more plus a lesson on nuclear propulsion. It can be very dry as human drama doesn't seem to be Clarke's strong point at this period of his writing. It certainly doesn't hold his interest. The synthetic HAL 9000 acts with more pathos and humanity than Bowman or Poole. This book is great for being ahead of its time as well as being the best at what it does. Not for everyone perhaps but I did not waste my time on it. If the ending of the movie version confused you, reading this book will make you 60% less confused. Return to movie and repeat as often as desired.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I thought this was well done but I guess I was expecting more from it in light of how good the band of brothers series was. This doesn't come close but very much worth watching.
0385732554|4.0|While I can't really write something more erudite and thoughtful than the other reviewers of this book I will add an observation. What really freaked me out about this little novella was the way in which people talked in this future dystopia. The speech is very stifled and over-intellectualized, but at the same time the characters are kind of super in-touch with their feelings when compared to twenty-first century humans. For example, there is this nightly that takes place in the early chapters after the family finished dinner where each family member talks about something that happened that day and how it made them feel. Then, they all analyze the situation, the feelings it produced, and talk about solutions or other aspects that may have been overlooked at first. It's kind of sweet in this quirky Bizzaro World way.    Funny thing is, the stilted way the characters talk remind me so much of Kro-bar and Lattis from the movie \\"The Lost Skeleton of Cadavara\\". It might as well have been set on the Planet Marva. I imagine all of the characters speaking in that cadence and emotional affect.
B001F7MSFM|3.0|This second outing for the candy-eating, cat-loving, cigar-chewing demon has all of del Torro's trademark visual and storytelling flair. The effects and creatures are typically imaginative and spectacular. There are some nice touches of his characteristic humour. And there are many references to earlier works, particularly Chronos and Pan's Labyrinth. Yes, there's much to enjoy here, but it isn't quite as successful as the first film. It falls a little short with the story, which is somewhat predictable and a bit overblown. Generally, it lacks some of the lightness of touch with which del Torro crafted the original movie. I also had a problem with the Johann Kraus character who struck me as unconvincing and clunky (by contrast, Luke Goss as Prince Nuada was something of a revelation). Overall this is an entertaining movie though it doesn't quite match del Torro's best. 3.5 out of 5 would be a fair rating.
1400049628|4.0|Come on, let's be honest for a moment. You know at least once you've been walking around the city or town you live in on a lazy summer afternoon and let your mind wander. You take note of the Federal Armory's location, the sturdy defensible buildings, locations of bridges and water barriers. Maybe as you've done home improvements you've put some thought into defensive measures Just In Case the zombie uprising occurs.    No? Just me and a select few? Well, then this book isn't for you.    If you have put some -serious- thought into anti zombie tactics, and maybe fantasized about taking up professional zombie hunting as a career choice than this book shall be your bible. Many have picked this up as a comic gag gift, but really the comedy comes from Brook's deadpan seriousness of the subject manner. At some point you may find yourself kind of wrapped up in it, imagining what it would be like if it really was nonfiction. I imagine the fictional writer of the book and what he would be like to sit down to tea with. Serious, kind of heartless and relentless in a way, but you could never be bored talking to this guy.    He glosses over the topics that would be covered in your usual survivalist enthusiast manual and focuses his laser-like beam of scholarly might on zombie characteristics and flaws and how to survive when the shambling dead are coming at you. In some ways, I think of this book and it's fictional counterpart World War Z in role-playing game terms. WWZ is set in the same universe and lays out how a \\"Level 4 Infection Event\\" as the book terms it would play out like a campaign guide, and The Zombie Survival Guide is like the sourcebook where Brooks lays out the facts of how the zombies behave, their physiology, abilities, and weaknesses. I read this book before World War Z and yes, the zombies behave exactly as described in this book.    I really liked the historical anecdotes that make up nearly the last half of the book; it was a nice touch and shows that he really put a lot of research into this work of \\"humor\\". Let me not forget the simple line-drawn illustrations in the book. They are clearly a parody of airline safety manuals with expressionless Ken Doll-like men doing bizarre things taken out of context. Even when fishing for underwater zombies with a spear gun and machete they are hilariously cool and calm like Hindu cows.    It certainly is his labor of love and if you're a zombie movie fan like I am you'll enjoy the read... and perhaps put together that Earthquake Preparedness Kit you've been putting off for years.
B002VWNICW|3.0|To put it simply, in this version of P&P, it is not the wonderful characters that Jane Austin created that are highlighted, it is the actors, mainly Miss Keira Knightly. This version goes way off track from the novel and didn't bring anything new or exciting to the adaptation except the popularity of it's leading lady. A better title for this remake would have been \\"Keira Knightly's Pride and Prejudice\\". Stick with the BBC Colin Firth version.I gave it three stars because the actor, Matthew Macfaden who plays Mr. Darcy is a favorite of mine from MI5, and The Pillars of the Earth.[[ASIN:B000E1ZBH2 Pride and Prejudice (Full Screen) (2005)]]
0307346617|5.0|Oh. My.    The most horrible thing about World War Z is that after you read it any other zombie apocalypse fiction will have to work that much harder to keep your attention. I read the Zombie Survival guide first, which skewed towards comedy with it's completely deadpan depiction of surviving undead plagues. I found it helpful to read this first as it gave me the background on what Brook's zombies can and cannot do.    WWZ is addictively engaging, I read it in two days and wished it would go on another 400 pages or more. It helped that since it was an \\"oral history\\" (epistolary novel) which is one of my favorite styles of fiction and the shortness of the \\"interviews\\" leads well to just powering though the book. I'll have to reread it soon.    The stories are related with upmost seriousness, which is an interesting twist for a zombie survival horror novel. I love the fact that there is a world-wide perspective of the disaster. Brooks uses the genre of zombie horror fiction to make scathing commentary on aspects of postmodern life, such as the culpability of the media, disastrous inertia of the military when dealing with new \\"asymmetric\\" threats, critiques on the governments of the U.S., China, the Russian Federation and others. He also covers the entire world as it is infested by the undead, from the story of a rogue Chinese missile submarine seeking refuge on the ocean floor (only to be deluged with zombies wandering in swarms on the ocean floor) to the brave astronauts on the International Space Station who forgo escape back to Earth so they can keep the communications and surveillance satellites operational. There are scenes of such terribleness but it never delves into hackneyed horror genre cliches, which is most welcome and refreshing for a zombie novel.    I dearly hope that the literary world takes this book as seriously as it deserves.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I will assume that mostly everyone is familiar with Jane Austin's story, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", either from the novel or the television and film versions of the novel, so I will keep this review simple and it's focus is the the Blu-ray format. The BBC's television production of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennett, and Andrew Davies as the screenwriter is hands down the best retelling of Jane Austin's beloved story, even today. But it is most impressive on the Blu-ray format. The lavish English countryside landscapes come alive in brilliant colors and Mr. Darcy is even more handsome in high definition. I have seen this version of the P&P many, many times on DVD and it was very good in anamorphic widescreen, but each time I watch it on Blu-ray, It's like I am seeing it for the first time, with the characters and beautiful scenary so vividly reproduced. I just had to tell anyone who loves this story as much as I do. Keep this on your Amazon.com watch list for a lower price or just go for it now-you won't be sorry.

0441172717|5.0|I recently reread Dune, by Frank Herbert and was again struck by the grandeur of the novel. In spite of placing the novel thousands of years in the future Herbert created a deep mythology to his universe. History, religious practices, even languages hinted at and slowly revealed. This technique was later emulated by the popular Star Wars series among others, but I think Dune contains amore detailed tapestry than subsequent works.    The character Paul Atreides embodies Dune's themes. He is the messiah to its imagined mythology, the prophet to its syncretic religions, and eventually ascends as emperor of its complex fictitious interplanetary government. The themes of the book are larger-than-life, as are its characters and none are as big as Paul. The first part of the book is mired in byzantine scheming and treachery, of which Paul adroitly maneuvers and overcomes. He is just fifteen at the start of the novel, but many characters comment on how adult and adroit he is despite his age. The later half presents Paul's harrowing trails as a religious leader (the \\"Lisan al-Gaib\\", the \\"Kwisatz Haderach\\") as he undergoes a ritual via poisoning that turns him into something more than human, granting prescience and other astonishing mental powers. It is fascinating to read about Paul's transformation into a sort of demigod/human supercomputer, yet it makes him less sympathetic of a character. In fact, his own mother recoils in horror at one point. He more resembles a conqueror like Alexander the Great than a pacifist prophet such as Jesus. Nevertheless it is Paul's heroism despite self-doubt and troubled conscience, and his mastery of political manipulation, grasp of both religious fervor and guerrilla warfare that make him one of science fiction's most influential characters.    Dune's tropes of quasi-Islamic prophecy, environmentalism and ecology, anti-colonialism self-determination movements, and religious ecumenicalism made it a best-seller in the mid sixties and they still remain relevant and resonant forty years later.

B000W91RUG|5.0|I find this show to be absolutely fantastic.     I especially enjoy all the little nerdy \\"hat-tips\\" from props in the backgrounds like DNA helices, Nintendo controller belt buckles, classic video games like Zork, stuff put on the grease-boards, and cameos from great scientists like George Smoot and Neil deGrasse Tyson make it a joy to watch every episode.    If you're a nerd, you'll thoroughly enjoy the show for the nerd jokes. If you're not, you'll probably still enjoy the bumbling of the nerds in their relationship attempts, or in Sheldon's case, the complete lack of interest in a relationship. Others may find it an interesting dip into nerd culture.

B0013XLDO0|5.0|I truly feel that Tift takes her listeners to \\"Another Country\\" with this album. The melodies flow one from the other; when the final, \\"Mille Tendresses\\", plays you realize the journey you have taken.

B0048Y9TPG|5.0|I am a huge fan of Mariah & have to say when she reveal she was releasing another Christmas album I did not take the news well  How can she top the classic 1st album?   After listening to MCIIY I can safely say this album is as good, if not even better than the 1st album  Her vocal performances are simply stellar especially on the traditional songs such as 'Noel' & 'Little Town of Bethlehem/Drummer Boy'  I love how seamlessly incooperates 2 songs together in the album.  The new songs written by her again showcases her immense songwriting capabilities.  'Oh Santa' is another holiday classic in the making alongside 'All I Want for Christmas is You'  'One Child' & 'When Christmas Comes' are simply beautiful. Love the jazzy vibe of 'When Christmas Comes' & of course how inspirational 'One Child' is  Amazing album! It will sell during the holiday season for years to come
0307341550|2.0|The main problem with this novel is the failure of the author to create any mystery or suspense. The main character Camille Preaker is a journalist who is sent back to her home town by her newspaper editor to write a story on the death of one young girl and the disappearance of another.  Shortly after Camille's arrival in her home town the missing girl turns up dead. However this is where the novel's problems start. Following the murder of the second young girl pretty much nothing occurs to advance the plot until the last fifty pages. The result is a large part of the novel lacks suspense and is filled with descriptions of small town life that go on and on including lengthy passages about the main character self harm problems. To be honest it was a struggle to finish the book. In terms of a mystery,  the story is let down by the fact that the murderer is very easy to predict. Gillian Flynn clearly has talent, her descriptions are excellent as is her ability to create atmosphere and she is clearly a brave writer who is willing to take on difficult subjects but ultimately she is let down by her inability to create a suspenseful story.

B00129H7VS|2.0|I cannot stress enough that this is a review of the quality of the bluray and not the film. The film is excellent, and you can see my review of the DVD to be satisfied with that fact. The bluray disks however are poorly produced and flawed. Perhaps by the time I write this, the problem has been fixed, as I ordered mine with the first batch produced. Half of the disks are poorly manufactured. The voices do not sink, the color bleeds out, and sometimes it just glitches. Some disks are brilliant and stunning, however, some are absolute garbage. IT IS NOT my bluray player. It works great on some disks, and other films.     An example of what happens.   On Disk 2, Carentan, the voices will often not match at all. The color becomes fuzzy, and at best looks like a VHS taped from HBO.   During Replacements, the same disk, the color goes to nearly black and white. The blue flowers however are so bright, they bleed into the other colors around them.     This happens on several different disks. This is just an example of poor manufacturing. I have tried to get replacement disks to no real avail.       Again, the movie is wonderful, Hollywood style historical, and dramatic. I love the film. But the quality of the bluray production is poor.
B00065F86U|5.0|I bought this to use on the Zeikos battery grip.  It works, but you have to really push hard to get the latch to engage with the grip.

Also, it doesn't exactly fit this grip and Zeikos doesn't sell one (at least that I could find).
1433521784|2.0|I purchased a leather bound ESV Study Bible as soon as they were available, after much hype and reviews.  When it arrived and I opened the box I was immediately dismayed.  When you spend this much on a Bible you have certain expectations. The cover was very thin, it didn't even stand up to comparison with a  bonded leather thin line bible I have had for nearly 20 years.    With all of the extensive work and impressive credentials and pre-release reviews I was expecting top notch details from top to bottom.    I have nothing but rave reviews for the extensive commentary, tables, charts, maps and illustrations.  Sometimes there are pages where there is more commentary than actual Bible text!  I decided to keep this Bible at home on the desk that I read it on, instead of carrying it with me to Bible Studies so that I would save it from some wear and tear.  However it was not long before the actual text block broke free from the cover.  I don't know that there IS any cover that could support the extreme weight other than a library style hardcover.  The paper inside was also very thin and not a very good quality. There was a lot of \\"read through\\" where text could be seen through the page from the page beneath it.    Originally you could only have access to the online version of the Bible with the access code that came with your Bible.  Now you can sign up and have full online access for free.  Sign up and use that. No, it's not like a bible you can carry with you to church, but the actual Bibles will not stand up to anything that rigorous either.

B0042AEOG0|2.0|At the risk of rating an entire album just based on one song alone, I gotta say ....WHAT IS UP with track 10?!?!  The version of \\"O Holy Night\\" included on this CD is one of the weirdest audio mysteries I've ever heard.  It's supposed to be a live version, but it plays this dreadfully over-produced mess of applause that drifts in and out of the music at mysterious times during the singing.  Completely inappropriate to the song, and obviously added in manually by the engineers after the whole thing was recorded.  I've seen the video of this on YouTube and you can tell it's completely fake too - the audience clapping scenes were spliced in to the middle of her singing footage in the editing room.  I don't care what type of church you go to, black, white, baptist, catholic, etc....but WHEN have you ever heard a 5 minute song being performed and the audience cheering and clapping wildly like they're at a rock concert ....FOR THE ENTIRE FIVE MINUTES OF THE SONG?!?!?  Applause at the beginning, applause at the end, maybe even some hoots and hollers once or twice midway through after a high note, but c'mon people!  No one sits there in the pews clapping and cheering like a maniac for 5 minutes in a row while someone's up there trying to sing!  Compeltely unrealistic and TOTALLY fake, shame on the producers for this tacky deception.<br /><br />Another bizarre thing about this version is that in the linear notes, all the track says is \\"O Holy Night - Live From WPC in South Central Los Angeles\\" and that's it.  No mention of what WPC is.  Like what, people are supposed to automatically know?  Worldwide Prayer Coalition?  White Power Convention?  Wild Party Corporation?  World Powerlifting Congress?  Washington Publishing Company?  It was only after a BUNCH of Google research that I discovered WPC stands for Westminster Presbyterian Church.  Now why on earth would they not mention that in the linear notes, are they trying to keep the full name of the church a secret?  Did the church want too much money in royalties for including their name in the CD jacket?  Is Mariah ashamed of her affiliation with the church now?  It's a really really strange omission.  Almost as strange as that mystery appluse *lol*<br /><br />Okay now for some positives! :)  The song \\"One Child\\" is clearly the standout track from the album, absolutely brilliant ballad that goes right up there with \\"My All\\" or \\"After Tonight\\" as one of my favorite MC ballads ever.  Honestly though, except for maybe 1 or 2 more tracks the rest of the album was kind of a snoozer.  The \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" was another great one, how it kind of segued into a quasi-dance mix halfway through. I can't WAIT to hear the Ralphi Rosario & Johnny Vicious remixes for \\"Auld Lang Sayne\\" which are sure to be played EVERY year on January 1st in the clubs :)  And hey Mariah - what stopped you from including the brilliant David Morales mix of \\"Joy To The World\\" as a bonus track on this album?  Those remixes are all almost impossible to find on CD these days.  It would've been a real treat to fans, and would've cost next-to-nothing, as the mixes have already been released and paid for years ago.  Ditto those new dance mixes of \\"All I Want For Christmas\\" released promotionally last year to DJ's, they weren't even pressed on CD or made widely available to fans, so why not throw a couple on this disc as a treat for the fans who aren't DJ's?nt too much money in royalties for including their name in the CD jacket?

0452286751|4.0|Fountainhead by Ann Rand is a classic. This is the reason I decided to read this particular book. I started it with an open mind and the idea that I would probably gain the ability to say I had read a Rand. I was soon startled to discover that her rich and varied textile of language not only fascinated me but made me desperate to read more.<br />This story is a study in psychosis. Each character displays various traits from major narcissistic tendencies to borderline personality.  Dominique and Roark, two of the most interesting and multifaceted characters, show signs of Asperger syndrome, a mild form of Autism.<br />The interactions between the characters are extreme and intriguing. I even found myself involved in the intricacies of architecture a major theme running through the story. The writing is sometimes stilted but the story kept its grip on me because of the massive possibilities.  Although this book was long and by the end I cared less than I had on page 217. Oh my goodness page 217!  I can say that I have not had the visceral feelings I had while reading this book in years.  Objectivism is going to be a philosophy I look into.  I take my hat off to the classics.

0440422973|1.0|This was written by THAT John Grisham? I can't believe it. At first the story was compelling though I felt it might be doomed from the start since the main characters are named Krank. The Kranks never have the strength of their convictions, never make the case that not only do they have the right to \\"drop out\\" of the holidays but that it's not such a bad idea. Instead, they hide behind the curtains, lurk in the dark and bite their nails when confronted by the holiday fascists who are their neighbors. Let's not talk about the moronic plot twist -- their daughter shows up Christmas Eve shattering their plans. Not her fault, they were spineless from the get go so why be surprised they give up their own dreams and scramble to get back into the mayhem of the season. Is there really a lesson here?  Stupid people can have a decent thought but will inevitably cave? No surprise the first thing the Kranks want to know about their daughter's fiance was how dark he was. \\"He wasn't dark at all!!!\\" Whew! So they're spineless AND racist! I looked hard but couldn't find any irony in this story. Not sure it would have helped. I'm only glad it was a short read. But the sour taste will take a while to forget.
1591843162|5.0|Thanks Seth.  You really made me think.<br />I love the concept that anxiety is practicing failure!<br />I do not agree however that all systems are about micromanagement.  I help people build simple and effective business systems that reduce the chaos that so often occurs without a system PLUS builds in the flexibility that encourages people to be a linchpin withing the system.  After 20 years of systems I think Seth's thinking here is locked in the early 90s or the large corporate systems and those paper heavy micro management disasters inhibit company growth.<br /><br />BUT the way I help people to build almost paperless systems based on understanding WHY and growing from feedback are truly different and Seth Godin has obviously not come across this unless he chose to ignore it to make a stronger point.

0307588343|2.0|Lawrence G. McDonald isn't a guy you'll take a liking to. He's the voice on your telephone at dinner time, calling you cold to sell you \\"such a deal\\" by making you feel you must be a very small fish in the money puddle if you aren't interested. In his pond, you're either barracuda or bait. Tell him to learn a useful trade like polishing guillotine blades, and hang up. But the truth is that he was nowhere near the giant sunfish in Lehman or any of the other firms for which he worked that he portrays himself to have been. And since he needed a ghost writer - Patrick Robinson - to brag about himself, we needn't suppose that his literary career will be long and glorious.<br /><br />If you make through the first third of the book -- Don't feel obligated! -- you may notice a certain resemblance between McDonald and the overreaching twerp played by Charlie Sheen in the first \\"Wall Street\\" film. McDonald also claims to have crashed job interviews without appointments by waving a bouquet of flowers or a pizza for the boss. Then, on page 87, he acknowledges his own reverence for the fictional Guru of Greed, Gordon Gekko, from that film. I can't help suspecting that McDonald is waiting by the phone for a call from Hollowwood begging to buy the rights to this flash-in-the-pan best seller.<br /><br />The title is all wrong. McDonald spills the basic truth in his Prologue. The 'colossal failure' of Lehman Brothers and other massive financial institutions was first and foremost a result of deregulation. Specifically, McDonald pins the rap (where it belongs) on the Financial Services Modernization Act of November, 1999, which repealed the  New Deal Glass-Steagall Act. But then, whoa, the mendacious little twerp tries to lay the blame for FSMA on Bill Clinton for signing a bill he didn't really approve, conveniently forgetting that it had passed both chambers of the Republican Congress with veto-proof margins at the same time that House Republicans were doing their very utmost to hamper Clinton's presidency and stifle any objections from their cowed Democratic 'colleagues.' If you're looking for a 'failure of common sense', look no further than FSMA and the eight years of shame and folly that followed under the Bush.<br /><br />That Prologue of seven pages is followed, not by any deep analysis of what went wrong with the American economy or inside Lehman Brothers, but rather by McDonald's own life story, from his parents' divorce to the bankruptcy that dumped him back on the job market. Honestly, it's kind of fun to read the evasions and exculpations of this narcissistic shmuck; everybody loves a clown, right? And there are some crumbs of gossip scattered along the path to the Witch's gingerbread house, along with some plain-English explanations of basic financial lore like the difference between stocks and bonds. Nothing you shouldn't know for your own protection, mind you, if you have even a dollar invested in a mutual fund! Ah, but if only it were true that the average small investor knew any of that!<br /><br />McDonald does eventually have one momentary lapse into supreme honesty, when he writes on page 103: \\"I could not help thinking how utterly disadvantaged the investing public was against this giant arsenal [the Lehman staff] of research and talent at the immediate disposal of Wall Street's frontline traders.\\"  !!! Like Duh! Larry! The wiles of Wall Street - of stock markets evermore - have always worked to concentrate wealth, that is, to transfer it from smaller investors to big, just as Gordon Gekko proclaimed. Yet the sheep line up to be sheared. What a truly colossal failure of common sense it would have been if the Bush Republicans had succeeded in 'privatizing' Social Security. I guarantee vultures like Larry McDonald -- he calls himself a vulture early in his narrative -- were clacking their beaks at that prospect!<br /><br />Readers' Bottom Line: if YOU have any common sense, and if you don't suffer from acute Tea poisoning, you don't need to read this moderately boring insider's confession. On the other hand, if you're a self-proclaimed 'conservative' who sincerely believes that private enterprise is more competent and less corrupt than government bureaucracy, it might be a healthy dose of reality for you.oring insider's confession.

031606792X|1.0|The first time I heard about the Twilight Series was through the movies and with its huge fan base and so much hype surrounding the films with all the \\"Team Edward\\" and \\"Team Jacob\\" excitement, I figured it had to be good. I was excited about the books and I thought I would just devour them and get lost in the story; I had also heard from many people that Breaking Dawn was the best book of the series and that there were big surprises and lots of twists and turns. Yeah Right!!!     I made it through the first three books and felt they were decent and I have to admit that I was very curious as to how the series would end since most of the immediate threats to Bella were gone and it seemed that all the secrets were out and the only threat left was the Volturi, so I pictured this awesome war and big crazy twists, and even characters dying. I really wanted some of the main characters to die, I know it sounds harsh but I think it would have given the story more depth and honesty.     The book started ok and I was able to suck down the wedding and the honeymoon phase thinking that it would get better once this passed. I even thought for a split second that Bella would remain human after she had told Edward that she wanted to stay human a while longer (even it was just for the sex) and get caught by the Voltaire, in which the war would erupt. Or maybe find out that she loves Jacob more and her sickening infatuation with Edward would finally be over. But then we get this crazy twist in which Bella is pregnant and all I could say was REALLY!? I mean REALLY?? This was such a joke and this is where the book just started to get bad but I kept going, thinking the baby would kill her or that she would come to her senses but no, it kept on dragging.     Then the way Bella became a vampire just sucked, 'nuff said; there was so much buildup about her changing and how it was supposed to be this huge production. This whole situation was just so pathetic, I mean she didn't struggle onebit with the change. She didn't kill or attack anyone (part of me wanted her to just eat the baby and get it over with), she had awesome powers and was just perfect in every way. Gag!!!     Don't even get me started on the whole Jacob imprinting on Renesmee thing(yeah the name is as stupid as it sounds). This was just beyond disappointing and made me feel cheated out of the relationship that Jacob and Bella had. Their friendship, their love, their first kiss, all for it to end with Jacob falling in love her Vampire Spawn, what a waste!!!!   (Oh, and Ms. Meyer, don't even think about writing a book about Jacob and Renesmee,  seriously, leave it as the waste it is).     This whole book was a joke, a waste, a disappointment and just plain boring. I felt like Stephenie Meyer was just trying to milk it for all it's worth, she should have quit in Book 3 while she was still ahead. I don't plan on reading anything that she puts out in the future, her writing style is just not for me. I also hope that she leaves this series alone and does not revisit it; there is nothing she can do to repair the damage that this book has already caused.     So really what it all boils down to is don't waste your time, and if you just have to read it, get this book from the library, don't spend your money on such rubbish.     Oh and just a side note, I WON'T be wasting my time with the movie. I can't even begin to imagine what kind of garbage that will be. I feel sorry for the actors who have to endure the pain of putting this movie together. At least it's almost over and they can put it behind them forever.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|This is a marvelous score to a film that I can't wait to see. Daft Punk really did something special here. It is not their usual type of music, which some hardcore fans are complaining about, and maybe that is with good cause. Yet, what is here is amazingly different that what I have heard before. The spirit of Daft Punk is here in every way. It may not be stuff that you can dance to, but it feels like they are evolving their sounds and trying something new. Plus, full orchestra! Yes, please! I am sure that they will return to their roots soon enough, but if they can dip into this type of project every now and then, we will all be richer for it.
B0042RUMEQ|4.0|Nicki has the voice, the personality, the range and talent of a SUPERSTAR! She's the hiphop Gaga. I love it!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Great knife. Solid feel - decent sharpness out of the box, but needed a slight regrind.  Amazing a knife this thick will slice paper like butter after splitting wood in the mountains all day.  Cant go wrong for the price!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Unbelievable....I usually don't favor animation/cartoon type movies, but this gem caught me off guard. I actually cried at the end...humor...redemption...FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This movie is super funny, we watched all 3 so far released seasons and it only gets better! Strongly recommend.
0811875555|5.0|This artbook is worth the money. Every page is packed full of amazing concept drawings and illustrations by top artists for the movie. Even though the movie is done in 3D animation, all the drawings in the book makes it almost feel like it was a traditional 2D animation film.
B0036EH3UC|3.0|\\"the plan\\" is inside SEASON 4.0 Disc 4.   (i bought the gray box: \\"BSG the complete series\\")    mine happened to have a distorted face, with the colors bleeding all over the \\"battlestar galactica\\" heading, but it played normally.    it would've been nice for \\"the plan\\" to have had its own jewel case, though, since there is clearly room for it in the boxed set.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I love paper, and I love the tactile experience of reading books, but after receiving a Kindle as a gift I am sold.  this was one of the first books I read on it, and yes, I understand all the hype.  Lisbeth Salander is a unique character - that's the real draw.  After sooooo many same old, same old movies and novels, she is a refreshing treat.  You may not like her, but you will certainly know you haven't met her before :)
B0040JHXTI|5.0|The Bruce Springsteen Box Set \\"The Promise of Darkness on the Edge of town (3CD/3DVD)\\", you could not ask for a better bargain and the set was just out of this world. I would recommend it to anyone who is into Bruce, what an exceptional purchase this was. Thumbs up on this Set.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|We bought SOC last about a year ago.  Our family is a 13 year old son, 19 year old son, and two mid 40's parents.  We all like to play the game so it appeals to different age groups.  Since the game is based on human decision, no two games are alike which keeps it fresh.  Also, there is some uncertainty as to who is actually ahead in the game which also makes it interesting to play for all players.  This is in contrast to many roll the dice games (Monopoly, Risk, for example) where the winner is known well in advance of the eventual ending of the game.    Becuase the game is based on strategy, I would not recommend for younger kids due to frustration level and understanding of the game.    The only thing that removes 1 star from the game is that it is a little sensitive to location.  The game board needs a flat, stable surface to play.  So it is not likr some games that can be played spur of the moment and pretty much anywhere.  So, I would call it a table game.  Which is not a negative just want to make sure that those that are looking for a game to throw down on the airport floor or on the ground in a tent should be aware of the board limitations and plan accordingly.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love this series. I found that most of the fans I know have at least a slight interest in science and some background with physics (even if it is just middle school physics).  Personally, I love Big Bang Theory because I studied engineering and knew people very similar to the gang. It's great when some of the lines are from your real life.
0399536108|1.0|Chris Guillebeau is certainly very good at marketing himself and creating the impression that his thoughts are \\"revolutionary\\". I haven't found anything in this book that was new to me. Most of Guillebeau's conclusions are obvious to anybody who spends a bit of time thinking about their life and their work - and almost every idea has been dealt with in a more creative way in other books that have been published long ago. It may be that this book is more revolutionary for people living/working in the US than for people living in Europe. I work for an organization where almost everybody works part time, and where it is absolutely no problem to take a few months off to go a a trip. So in my view it's ridiculous to describe someone as a kind of hero just because he quit his job to cycle across the US.     This book doesn't really get you thinking. Instead, Guillebeau establishes himself as a kind of role model, which may be helpful for people who want to copy him - but not for people who want to find their own way.     If you want a much more creative approach, have a look at John Williams' \\"Screw Work Let's Play\\". This book may be little known, but it is really good!
B003YP7N9O|3.0|If you buy this for the DVD of the 1971 Madison Square Garden concert, you'll be disappointed.  What you get is a cartoon of Tull waving at you over the music track of the concert.  I guess this is Ian Anderson's sense of humor or maybe he has just run out of money but it is a ripoff for any Tull fan.  If you buy this for the CD soundtrack of the full concert, you should be happy.  We have gotten parts of this before and it is nice to get the full concert.  If you buy this for the expanded Stand Up CD, you'll be disappointed.  Most of the additional music has appeared before on an album or other CD.  This was worth the price if sold as a single CD of the concert, but hardly worth it as sold as a 2CD/1DVD pack.  I have been a lifelong Tull fan since the late 60s and have multiple albums and CDs.  But this escapade is a travesty.    tom white, a lifelong Tull fan ... until now
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This is a powerful, compelling, and musically diverse collection of songs.  I love Eminem; I listen to his albums on repeat play in my car and love every opportunity to see the new directions his talent is taking him.  The songs I can get enough of on this album:  W.T.P., So Bad, Love the Way You Lie, Spacebound, Seduction, 25 to Life, Talkin' to Myself, You're Never Over, Cinderella Man, Cold Wind Blows, and Not Afraid.  Less thrilled with \\"On Fire\\"; maybe warming up a little to \\"Almost Famous\\" and \\"No Love\\" (but very slowly).  \\"Untitled\\" is okay; don't listen to that particular track often, but my reaction is more positive than negative.    No matter what he goes through, Em remains a musical genius, ever growing and evolving.  His music makes me think, laugh, and feel.  It just gets better the more you listen to it.  His style is direct and passionate and absolutely brilliant.  Love the bite, the tenderness, the playfulness, the humor, the contradictions, the cockiness, the vulnerability, the confidence, and the phenomenal talent this man possesses.    Eminem, I am deeply grateful for your talent.  Thanks for staying in the game.  Thank you for your album dedication to all who are in a dark place.  Thank you for sharing your gifts with us.  My life is different and better because you exist and you do what you do.  Thank you.
0525423273|5.0|I fell in love with Stephanie Perkins through her blog and Twitter, so I had been dying to read this one and squealed SO loud when the ARC arrived. But that also meant I had extremely high expectations, and I can assure you right now, this book not only met each and every one of those expectations--it exceeded them. Love, love, LOVED it! And I'm not alone. Everywhere I go I see rave reviews for ANNA, and they are so so so deserved. Seriously, even if you're not into Contemp, you should give this book a chance.<br /><br />If you still need more convincing--here's 5 undeniable reasons why you NEED to read ANNA like, NOW!<br /><br />1. Incredible pacing: Don't be fooled by the \\"love story\\" concept and think this is going to be a slow moving story. I haven't quite figured out how she did it, but Stephanie moves the plot along like it were an action/suspense novel. You are on the edge of your seat the entire time. Need proof? I started the ARC on my weekend away for my anniversary, and we almost missed our dinner reservation because I had. to. know. what was going to happen next. And when we got back from dinner? Yeah, I picked right back up where I left off (my husband was less than thrilled...)<br /><br />2. Delicious moments: And I don't mean kissing--though there's plenty of yummy kisses too, don't you worry. But what I think Stephanie really mastered was the \\"almost\\" moments. Two people sitting next to each other in a dark theater, feeling their legs touching and wondering what it means. Wondering why the other person doesn't move away and hoping it's because they want to touch more. Late night phone conversations helping each other through hard times, sharing secrets you never shared with anyone else. All those little \\"SO close\\" moments that tug at your heart and make you want to shout at the book: JUST REALIZE YOU WERE MEANT FOR EACH OTHER! It's awesome.<br /><br />3. Believability: You know how some romantic books or movies have these absolutely RIDICULOUS reasons why the two characters aren't together? Yeah...ANNA doesn't have that problem. Even though you want want want them to be together more than anything and they come so so so close several times, you totally get why they aren't together. Bonus: it's not so impossible of an obstacle that when they do get together it feels forced like, can you really let that go? It's the perfect mix of obstacles and struggles.<br /><br />4. Imperfection: No--that's not a bad thing, in this case. What I mean is, ANNA's characters aren't perfect. They have faults, even some physical faults (Etienne may be a regulation hottie, but he's not *quite* as tall as some girls might like, and he has an imperfectly perfect smile). And that makes them even more likable. Because they're real. I grow tired of books where the characters are just a little too perfect. It's delightfully refreshing to have some real, relatable flaws, and love the characters even more because of them.<br /><br />5. Setting: Could there be a more perfect setting for a romantic story than Paris? I think not. And Stephanie paints such a beautiful, tangible Paris you feel like you're there. You walk the streets. You taste the food. It's almost like the city is a character in the book, and you can definitely tell she took the time to know all the ins and outs of her setting and make it as detailed and real as possible. You will feel like YOU lived a year in Paris by the end.<br /><br />So what are you waiting for? Get yourself a copy. You won't regret it.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|Good quality and adds the extra storage space I need.  The cupholders are a little tight for a coffee to-go cup (for example), but fit my metal water-bottle just fine.
B000002JNJ|4.0|Message in Blood and Heresy rock seriously.<br /><br />Vulger and Far Beyond get boring quick but I'd recommend anyone trying out Pantera to start with Far Beyond and work your way back.  That album is more accessible than this one.
0763650420|4.0|This is one of my favorite books to gift to young ones and their parents.  I received this order very quickly! My grandchild will enjoy the story and illustrations over and over with the added visual of the CD! Thanks! Joan
B00006DEF9|3.0|The women Lena's with the squeaky high voice, honestly, are you kidding me? Just spare me. So unnecessary, so irritating and soooo over dramatic and kill switch, volume off. Sure the dance numbers spectacular if not over done. I am a lover of musicals, old perfection: 'Till the Clouds Roll by, American in Paris, White Christmas, Jazz Singer,' Mary Poppins, My Fair Lady, Scrooge (Albert Finney), Cabaret, Victor/Victoria, all amazing! Sound of Music, well not only best musical ever, unarguably, but one of the finest films ever made, Oliver! LOVED IT, Fiddler on the Roof (Topol I mean come on, EPIC!), the King and I (EPIC), even Sweeney Todd, awesome, Newsies FUN!, just fun.<br /><br />This was just f'in boring. JUST drill a hole in my skull boring. I consider myself a film fanatic. I loathe critics like AO Scott and the neanderthal moron Roger Ebert, so my opinion in the grand scheme of things is just words, but this was just garbage. (with all due respect to Gene Kelly of course).<br /><br />The last thirty minutes was so great, so well done, the singing and dancing were wonderful. I wish they had just shut their mouths when they weren't singing and dancing, because I know 11 year olds that could act better.<br /><br />Laughable, ostentatiously 'vanilla' Broadway robot acting, pretentious film.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|he would be in this band.  Passion, power, and profound lyrics all wrapped up in a delightfully scruffy package.  These guys ROCK.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|I own all of his albums. I have seen him in concert twice. Do not purchase this album. In my opinion, this album is a low point in his career.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|There is nothing mundane or humdrum about \\"Black Swan\\"; whereas, previous Aronofsky films have been about domestic, familial relationships, for instance, that have been shattered into ruins due to drugs, death, or foolhardy choices in life, even what could be considered as ordinarily grounded in \\"Black Swan\\", say the behind the scenes production of the ballet, its world is still rife with biting cattiness and backstabbing; it really is anything but ordinary. Even removing the progressively deteriorating mental state of Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), the world of ballet is fodder for subjective subjunctives: I hope, I dream, I wish, etc., which have psychological underpinnings; exactly perfect for twisted, metaphysical endeavours. This extra-ordinariness could be an argument as to why there is a seemingly lack of that inherent raw, primal, naked emotion that is more or less subtle than usual that have governed Aronofsky's previous works: we don't really know who Nina is; we haven't been given enough time to really get to know her. Merely, as opposed to understanding her, we feel for her, we pity her, like a Greek god. Surely because it is by virtue of one of the main themes of the film: fragile mortal being attaining perfection. What comes off is a rather cold, off-putting experience; our heroine is merely a placeholder or a spokesperson, and not a grounded character, for the overly ambitious and dreamers in us. On the other hand, this 'coldness' is neither a part of criticism against the film nor a detriment to it; on the contrary, bitter, sharp, and chilly cold is actually its virtue: corresponding to Nina's fragile existence and crackling psyche, the film is erratic, schizoid, and discomforting; the film's fractured, unreliable point of view brings up Polanski's \\"Repulsion\\", and Lynch's \\"Mulholland Drive\\", as comparison. In addition, with the operatic, heightened bravura that Aronofsky creates, what we get is an intoxicating blend of the magnificent and the strange: the tragedy is not of a sentimental, emotional kind, but a grand, manic, glorious art that is at times, as you sit there completely enthralled under its spell, horrifying, transcendental, and draining.     So fittingly enough, seeing this film from a point of view that looks at the work as almost an allegory or an abstraction makes it more rewarding. Regardless of how devoid it is with that surprising subtle Aronofsky sentiment that is all at once tender, sweet, and painful, \\"Black Swan\\" is a passionate, even bombastic, work that doesn't invite you in, it pulls you into it and swallows you whole. Natalie Portman's shockingly commanding, tragic performance, which should definitely garner her a statue or two come awards night, elevates this film into a higher level that could have been camp, sleazy, or ridiculous, but as testament to Aronofsky's talent and vision, comes out very beautiful; a graceful, elegant swirling mess of schizoid, psychotic paranoia that gleefully raises glass to the ever truthful adage: what separates the mediocre from the genius is the latter's willingness to embrace pain, even death. So one could perhaps forgive Aronofsky for not sprinkling \\"Black Swan\\" with moments to breath; scenes that allow for quiet, introspective, ethereal beauty that he is usually more than capable of. Instead, beauty here is glorious, ostentatious, and in your face, like Nina's delusion, or the showmanship of the art of ballet itself: it is never quiet, it is ceaselessly building up to its grand crescendo.    In other words, \\"Black Swan\\", in its magnificent, glorious madness, is perfect.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Right off from the first episode we'll yanked right back in. Thrills, chills, drama, humor and of course people eating clowns. Always fun, excellent acting as both Jensen and Jared continue to expand as Dean and Sam. Excellent guest stars.
B0025KW29U|3.0|NPH and Joss Whedon make an excellent combo but it was too short to be satisfying. Hopefully they will make a full lenght movie out of this but i am not keeping my hopes high
B000FP2OPY|5.0|While I bought this as a gift since I already own my own sets, I can say that this is one of the best series going today! Right off from the Pilot episode it hooks you and who can forget the classic line that Dean says in that episode. Each episode brings a closer look at what makes the brothers tick and you're never disappointed.
B0049D1TCM|5.0|Ignore the Haters....there probally just.... old has been female \\"rappers\\"!....that are writing negative reviews...it's all a setup! I believe....that's why I brought her album for myself! and the negative reviews is what made me buy it sooner!...so you folks who are doing it just to hate...your really helping!....and I brought the...\\"Deluxe Edition\\"!....just to support a sista! and I see why they (the haters) don't want you to hear this! album....buy it and you'll see too it's...FIRE!....peace out.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I love this movie!! Buying this from Amazon was a smart decision because of the value and the no hassle way of receiving this product.
B000H5TVKI|3.0|I remember i saw this on tv some years ago, but i don`t think it`s the best film i have seen. I think it have some good action scenes. I like the scene in the jungle where Rambo takes out the policemen, one by one. I really liked the Instrumental version of the theme song It`s A Long Road. I also think some of the other music was also good. I think Jerry Goldsmith was a great composer.<br /><br />Picture Quality: 4/5<br /><br />I liked the picture quality much more than the audio quality.I didn`t expect it to look so clear and detailed. I think the colours and such look clear. Just look how detailed the blood looks. I expected it to look far worse than this, so i was happy with the picture quality.<br /><br />Audio Quality: 2.5/5<br /><br />I was very disappointed with the audio quality. They didn`t restore the DTS- HD High Resolution 5.1 as well as the picture quality. The DTS-HD HR isn`a a lossless format either. It`s more like a high end lossy format. Nearly everything in this remix sounds tinny and flat. I think the explosions had ok bass, but all the gunfire effects sounds like cap guns. I also think the dialog was mixed too low in the Center speaker. I had to crank up the volume on the Center speaker each time there was a dialog scene.<br /><br />Not good. I think the dialog at times sounded tinny. The Rear speakers was mostly used in action scenes, but they also used for music. I think the rears could have been used a bit more, but ok. This is certainly not the film to impress your friends with, audio wise, of course. Too bad those in charge of the DTS- HD High Resolution 5.1, couldn`t restore/remix it much better than this very disappointing audio track. Hm.<br /><br />Film: 3.5/5<br />Overall: 3/5
B004222UC8|5.0|\\"Eternal Idol\\" is one of the GREAEST LPs to carry the Black Sabbath moniker. Sure, it has no Ozzy or Dio (or Geezer and Bill, for that matter) but it is their best-ever effort wothout them. In fact, Sabbath recorded 9 near-flawless albums: the first 6 with the Oz, the first two with DIO (RIP) and this!  I was also pleased to see the unreleased first version with Ray Gillen (also RIP) is now officially availible after years of 3rd generation bootlegs. Here's hoping for a 2 CD rerelease of \\"Born Again\\" with the first mix that Ian Gillan liked (and a bonus live version of Iommi covering \\"smoke on the water\\"!).
1933308087|5.0|Great book very good quality well worth the money and was impressed how fussy cutting is shown in detail on the blocks. Also enjoyed the older patterns.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Compared to most of what is deemed popular \\"music\\" today this CD shines.  Josh Grobin's stylings demonstrate a clarity and strength that does justice to the melodies selected.  Few singers today can match his talent and versatility.  A pleasant surpise for one who wishes to relax awaits.  What a contrast to the normal moronic drivel we encounter on radio stations and in night clubs with the common undisguised absence of talent. Grobin's range and clarity of voice demonstrate ability, control and training. It is uplifting and emotional instead of full of angst and noisy to the point of irritation.  Get this CD for a treat--you won't be disappointed.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|There are 3 versions of Salt available for viewing, the Theatrical, Extended, and Director's Cuts.  They run 1:39:56, 1:40:58, and 1:43:59 respectively (credit to Interzone_Records for the correction).  Here are the major differences as compared to the base Theatrical Cut, e.g. Theatrical vs. Extended, and Extended vs. Director's Cut.  Note, SPOILERS follow below, so read at your own risk.  There are a few major, significant differences between the versions.<br /><br />The Director's Cut makes the most sense plot-wise, and includes some better character development, in my opinion.<br /><br />THEATRICAL vs. DIRECTOR's CUT<br />*****************************************************<br />1)  Evelyn Salt's opening interrogation scene in North Korea is longer and more brutal.  The soldiers force a tube down her throat and subject her to more intense questioning, followed by several kicks to the abdomen.<br /><br />2)  Extended scene of Orlov training little kids who will be future sleeper agents.  As the kids finish a race through the woods, Orlov asks which kid was first, and which was last, whipping the last kid with a riding crop.<br /><br />3)  Abduction of Michael (Salt's husband) by Orlov's thugs is shown.<br /><br />4)  Additional scene where Michael tells Salt about a new species of spider that he has discovered.<br /><br />5)  Childhood scene between Salt and Schnaider at Orlov's training camp.<br /><br />6)  Salt's husband is NOT shot in the Director's Cut; rather, he is slowly drowned and Salt is forced to watch.  Michael's death is much more harrowing in the Director's Cut.<br /><br />7)  Salt kills Orlov with a broken bottle, and the stabbing is shown in more detail, rather than off-screen.<br /><br />8)  Salt's rampage through Orlov's freighter HQ is more graphic.<br /><br />9)  Gunfights depict more bullet holes and blood, but nothing overly gory.<br /><br />10) Winter kills the president in the Director's Cut, whereas in the Theatrical cut, Winter only knocks him unconscious.  I always thought the Theatrical cut never made much sense, because the President would easily be able to identify Winter as the traitor.<br /><br />11)  At the end of the movie, there is a voiceover that subtly suggests that the vice president is actually one of Orlov's sleeper agents, setting the stage up for a sequel.  This voiceover is not present in the Extended Cut.<br /><br />EXTENDED CUT vs. DIRECTOR's CUT<br />*****************************************************<br />1)  The changes listed above in the Director's Cut are also done in the Extended Cut, with the exception of the differences below.<br /><br />2)  The President is only knocked unconscious in the Theatrical Cut (and killed in the Director's Cut).  In the Extended Cut, Winter attempts to make his way towards the unconscious President, who is being wheeled away on a stretcher, in order to kill him.<br /><br />3)  The biggest difference in the Extended Cut is that Salt doesn't kill Orlov until the end of the movie.  So the entire sequence in the Theatrical and Director's Cuts where Salt annihilates Orlov's thugs on the barge is missing.<br /><br />At the end of the Extended Cut, she is being interrogated by Peabody, where she fakes suicide and is taken to a hospital.  She subsequently escapes from the hospital, finds Orlov (back in Russia somewhere), and kills him.cks him unconscious.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I listen mainly to classical music and opera. Sound quality is crisp. I am very picky on headphone. Surpassed my expectations.

B001OQCV6A|3.0|Kinda goofy take on Sherlock- I don't expect the new one to be any better- Just my opinion-not the sellers fault, it was delivered quickly in perfect condition.
0812973992|1.0|I bought this book based on all the positive feedback from critics and Frank McCourt but I couldn't get past his style of writing to really enjoy the work. He uses too many short, clipped sentences like something a high school student would use to write a homework assignment. The ball is round.The round ball is blue. Blue is the color of the sky. blah blah blah.    But I do agree it started out very nicely in Ireland but once we hit NYC, I became less interested in the characters and story.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I really liked this movie.  It's a very involved plot that revolves around manipulating dreams.  DiCaprio, who is always good, runs a small band of dream Extractors.  They use a machine and chemicals to plant themselves into the dreams of others, usually to steal corporate data.  Sounds easy enough, but there are ways to guard against people invading your thoughts while you sleep.  There are ways to train your mind to resist such intrusions.  This manifests itself as the subconscious creating armed guards to fight off the intruders.  So what you get are some very entertaining \\"Matrix\\" like battles in the dream.  The name of the movie, \\"Inception\\", refers to the act of planting an idea in someone's subconscious and making them believe it's their own idea.  This is considered an almost impossible feat and requires delving very very deep within someone's subconscious.  This means going into dreams within dreams and so forth.  Complicating matters is the fact that DiCaprio's character has some deep problems in his subconscious.  The projections of his wife keep showing up in his dreams trying to unravel all his plans.  It's an amazing movie.  The plot is very complex and can sometimes wrap itself up like a pretzel, so you really have to pay attention.  The Blu Ray quality is great.  You get a digital copy as well as the standard DVD included, which is a great deal.  I highly recommend this Blu Ray movie.
B0042K4ZZK|5.0|I wasn't sure when I started watching because there were little differences like Division instead of Section & Percy instead of Operations. I was also a little unsure of Shane West as Michael, however he has delivered and the other minuscule differences have no impact on how good this show is. It's a great revamp of the show. the acting is very good and the action is non-stop. I love it!!
B002ZG981E|5.0|Five stars for the movie. If you're one of those people that walked away during the movie then you should stop reading this. This is one of those mind bending movies that make you think and ask questions not some mindless all muscle kill and blow up typical American war movie. It's a pure brain puzzle... if your IQ is above average you'll love it!!!  Movies are not all about special effects but a good plot and good actors - this movie has both and some since special effects are great outstanding.     The part I'm hating is Warner Brothers distribution system for the digital copy. Unlike other movies that were digital copies and came on a media this does not. You have to download and install WB DRM software/spyware on your computer to download and activate the movie which is 1.5GB. By using their DRM software the movie will be locked to the device you're downloading it on. You're out of luck if your computer breaks... or fire up torrent and get it once more. But wait, this is considered piracy... Warner Brothers and all RIAA schmucks can sue you for piracy although you did pay for it. Amazing how justice is served in a democratic system, too bad capitalism is killing it.
B003Q6D1Z6|5.0|This past year I saw The Social Network, Inception, The Town, and Shutter Island all in theaters. While I enjoyed them all, none of them enraptured me like Catfish. The film is shot in a documentary style format, and whether it truly is an authentic film or merely a mimicry of reality is up for debate. However, most people here are probably more curious about the complaints concerning the authenticity and \\"ethics\\" of Catfish, and all I can say is don't let those negative reviews discourage you from seeing this film if you enjoy a great movie. What most people are failing to acknowledge is that anytime you film something and edit it for the public, regardless of whether its staged for a movie or an interview for a news segment, just the fact that it is being fashioned together and filmed according to a director's vision, a degree of artificiality is immediately added to the event. People can argue back and forth about whether Catfish is real, but it does not change that its a beautifully shot movie that really makes you think. Films should encourage thought and provoke the viewer and Catfish does just that. Regardless of whether its \\"real\\" or not, it truly is a brilliant film that I couldn't resist watching twice in 24 hours. Few films have touched or provoked me enough to watch multiple times in a row, but Catfish is an exceptional film.<br /><br />Another disclaimer about the film is that those who have a facebook/twitter/myspace or any form of social network site are probably going to enjoy this film more than an individual who does not use online networking sites. This film deals with issues that any teenager or young adult who grew up during the social network revolution will immediately be able to identify with. So if you're a 45-year old dad who rarely uses internet, this may not be the film to see. That's not to say that an individual without social network experience cannot enjoy the film, but I suspect the whole experience will be much less interesting and far more tedious. Also, although some of the movie trailers proclaimed Catfish to be some sort of Hitchcockian thriller or horror film, be aware that while it has suspenseful points and even horror elements, the film is a docu-drama. A slowly unfolding look at networking websites and the personas people create for themselves.<br /><br />As far as the product itself, the movie looks stunning on Blu-ray. The scenes at the beach as well as the shots of the zoomed in pixels of the computer monitor truly radiate off the screen and add to this unique movie experience. The audio is also excellent with no distortion or unintended noises. As far as special features, nothing is including aside from a 25min Q&A with the filmmakers (shot also in HD). The Q&A is informative and interesting, but it would have been nice to have a full director's commentary along with other features.<br /><br />Overall, Catfish is a fascinating film that I would highly recommend to any members of the facebook generation. Others may enjoy it as well, but it is the frequent users of the many social network sites who will find themselves entranced by the premise of Catfish. Ultimately, if you want a typically-shot film with a cut and dry plot and a clearly labeled sign proclaiming the film to be \\"fiction\\" or \\"non-fiction,\\" look elsewhere. The truth is that almost all films are comprised of both fictional and non-fictional aspects, and the sooner we all acknowledge that truth the sooner we can move on and just enjoy the movie.tedious.

B003IY47JK|4.0|I bought the mp3 download of this album after seeing the video for \\"Frozen\\" on youtube. I can say I really like the album, but what pisses me off about it is that it has three songs with \\"gutteral\\" growling in it. The female lead singer is amazing and has a beautiful voice and is more than capable of carrying the music without that gutteral growling. I already deleted those three songs off of my MP3 player and I hope that there is not anymore of that from this band in the future.    Overall the songs are very well written, the instruments are played masterfully and are not over the top or speed metal. This is truly beautiful songs, all sung in a soulful and melodic voice that blends well with the music. This album was an easy 4 out of 5 stars. If it would not have had that gutteral growling garbage on the 3 songs I would have gave it a 5/5.    I will still be purchasing \\"April Rain\\" also. If you like this band, please check out the album \\"The Forgotten Goddess\\" by Echoes of Eternity.

B0044XV3R8|5.0|Avatar should be seen as the spectacle it is and the enormous work to create it.<br />I enjoyed this movie, and found it has a good story that doesn't get boring and keeps up a good pace.<br />The 5.1 sound is well done and the picture is stunning.<br />Avatar is a great entertainment, particularly if your a Science Fiction fan or someone who enjoys adventure with a twist.
0891419195|5.0|This is the finest personal war memoir I have ever read, made more significant by the kind of Pacific campaign Sledge and his Marine comrades had to endure. Small wonder the book has never gone out of print since it was first published.

0756405890|3.0|While this book is beautifully written, it just really doesn't have a lot of meat to it.  This is a \\"day in the life\\" story about a guy at university.  He's supposed to get incredibly famous for something or another someday, but we don't know what yet. OK  I just had a hard time making myself care. It was well-written enough that I read the whole thing, but I never did see what it was getting at.  Maybe it's just the vehicle of the protagonist telling his memoirs in chronological order, but to me it had a lot of promise it just didn't live up to.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|One word that instantly springs to mind when I think of the Disney's `Beauty and the Beast' is EPIC.  Yes, this film has stood the test of time (if 20 years can really be regarded as a serious `test') and has proven to be one of, if not THE, most beloved Disney film currently in circulation.  It was, up until last year, the only animated film to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination (`Up' finally joined the elite group, and I have a feeling `Toy Story 3' will rightfully join them this year) and it's easy to see why, for frame for frame, song for song, emotion for emotion; `Beauty and the Beast' is a notch above the rest.<br /><br />Not only one of the greatest animated films ever made (my money is still on `The Grave of the Fireflies' as the actual `best') but `Beauty and the Beast' has the added bonus of being one of the greatest musicals ever put to film.  Each song beautifully illuminates the films central core and adds depth and meaning and affection to every frame.<br /><br />I mean, there are very few films where I will stoop to singing along, and this is one of the few.<br /><br />The fact that this film reduces me to a gigantic ball of weepy goo is not really important, but it must be said that the emotional resonance within `Beauty and the Beast' is another reason why this particular film is such an important and substantially memorable addition to the Disney canon.  The tale told, that of a spoiled Prince banished by an enchantress to live his days as a horrid beast until he learns to love and can be loved in return, is one that sticks with the audience and really invests itself.  The layers of depth here are beautifully examined, albeit in a sing-song and rather kid friendly manor, so that even adults can walk away feeling something in their hearts (which is precisely why this garnered that Best Picture nomination).  The repartee between The Beast and Belle is actually believable and adds a layer of reality to the proceedings.  You can see the heart of the film worn on its sleeve.<br /><br />\\"Isn't this amazing!\\"<br /><br />Alas, my love for the rich animation, the boisterous musical numbers (`Be Our Guest' is one of the best Disney songs, ever), the impassioned performances (they may merely be voice actors, but the emotional relevance is there in every syllable) and the soulful understanding of the material goes unmatched, really.<br /><br />In my eyes, this film should have EASILY taken the Oscar that year.  Sure, `The Silence of the Lambs' was a great film, but it is no where near as beloved as moving as this classic Disney experience!eve.    \\"Isn't this amazing!\\"    Alas, my love for the rich animation, the boisterous musical numbers (`Be Our Guest' is one of the best Disney songs, ever), the impassioned performances (they may merely be voice actors, but the emotional relevance is there in every syllable) and the soulful understanding of the material goes unmatched, really.

B0042816YK|3.0|I read the book prior to seeing the movie and LOVED the book.  The details and emotions that so important in the book are not shown in the movie.  I loved this book so much and was very disappointed in the movie.  Julia Roberts did a good job as always.  If you loved the book the movie will disappoint for sure!
B002ZG980U|3.0|I enjoyed \\"Inception\\" immensely in the movie theater and was looking forward to reviewing it in detail when I got the DVD.<br /><br />Even though I like the movie a great deal -- I have deducted two stars because the DVD comes up painfully short in the extras department.<br /><br />Yes, there are a few extras, but THEY'RE painfully short -- probably twenty minutes in total -- and there's NO director's commentary.  I think that the previews run longer than the extras.<br /><br />Shame on WB.  Such a highly regarded film deserves a much better DVD release -- and reserving some of the extra content for the BR package is NO excuse.<br /><br />The studios would love us all to move up to BR, but many of us still have SD CRTs -- and given the dearth of quality programming on TV these days, that isn't likely to change until our trustworthy old tubes die out.<br /><br />So I'm sorry to report that this is far from the dream DVD I was hoping for...

0385339089|4.0|John Grisham has succeeded here in writing a heartwarming tale involving an eleven year old kid in trouble, his messed up family, and his possibly more messed up lawyer.  I really enjoyed the main character despite him seeming much older than his age at times, but I guess that's the point.  While the \\"thriller\\" element of the book wasn't high it was charged with emotion.  Missing here was Grisham's usual ability to take you into whatever southern city his book takes place in.  I never really got that here.  Overall though, a really good book.
B000I0QK74|5.0|.. what's there not to like? If you grew up listening to James Taylor as I did and you're the type that likes Christmas music then you'll love this album. Even though James is not a kid anymore his voice is still as clear and sharp as ever. The acoustic guitar is prominent as with all his music. Most of the songs are ones you already know with two added that I was not familiar with. None of the songs have been butchered like so many contemporary artists do today. \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" will not be going on my iPod, not because because it's a bad rendition of the song but because I've never liked it no matter who does it. 12 songs. 11 Christmas songs. A great price. What's there not to like? Get yourself this CD.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Me = no fan of shaun of the dead or hot fuzz. I for one just don't care for the british humor mostly..sorry BBC office haha. But this, this is something special. Honestly I had no intention on seeing this after the trailer but the girlfriend convinced me and boy did I love it! My feet were rocking to the soundtrack, my eyes were wide open due to all the lovely effects and visually catching backgrounds, and I was sitting up. This movie will be added to the collection soon! You have to take it with a grain of salt though, like you would with knight and day. There just movies that are completely unrealistic, yet very entertaining and something for everyone. More for adults then children in my opinion. I also think since both hot fuzz and shaun of the dead were rated R and more violent and vulgar, Wright should have gone a little further and done a \\"kickass\\" style movie with actual blood and where the people in the movie actually get bruises and bloodied up. Scott didn't have one scratch on him by the end of the movie and that is hard to believe cuz homeboy got thrown around whole movie just about..That is the one and only flaw I have.<br /><br />-Cam

B002VKE1K2|5.0|The Review:<br /><br />Paranormal Activity 2 is a sequel done right.  Taking place alongside the events of the first film, Paranormal Activity 2Paranormal Activity protagonist, Katie.

It seemlessly integrates into events of the first film, and the story occurs prior to, concurrently with and susequent to the events of the first film.  This is the only instance I can think of where watching the sequel before the original film would work just as well, if not better than, the other way around.<br /><br />Katie and Kristi's family are victims of a family curse whereby a demon has laid claim to the soul of the family's firstborn son, Hunter.  Just like the original, Paranormal Activity 2 is notable for getting its scares without ever showing very much.  It relies on sound and what we can't see to evoke terror and it's very effective.  Even the way the first person camera is introduced and sustained is rather clever, and surprisingly believable, unlike, say, Cloverfield.<br /><br />Paranormal Activity 2 is not just a worthy sequel, but a top notch horror movie in its own right. If you enjoyed the first film, then worry not.  This sequel retains everything that made the original great and greatly expands on the first film.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.
0307346617|3.0|This book was very frustrating, not in reading it, though it was slow at times and dragged at many points, it was more the way I should rate it- yes I was trying to figure out how I would rate this book for Amazon.com while I was reading it. I think that sums up the feel of this book very well: its appeal to be liked, but at the same time begging you to 'think' about its overall appeal, and hence 'judge' it. I've settled on three stars, though for a while I was thinking of a four star review, but I had to take it down a notch. So the breakdown of the stars is as follows:<br /><br />* 1st star- Its about zombies. I'm biased what can I say. The pace moves quickly, it was a very quick read, a few days.<br />** 2nd star- It's got very very good images, all of the zombie style of attacks, the scenery, the pure imagination of the whole book by the author, a global zombie war, on land, in the sea, and underground- some of the scenes were really haunting, and Brooks describes them perfectly.<br />*** 3rd star- The concept was original. Yes, Romero's zombies as a metaphor for our society was great, and it's been done alot since then, but Brooks takes this into truly new ground which is why I wanted to give this:<br />**** the 4th Star- A documentary about zombies, an original take, with tons of underlying issues. He gave something new to the zombie genre, and put it into 'today's' context. I think the originality alone and the breadth of coverage the book spans should give this book 4 stars...but<br />*** knocked down to three stars. Why? The writing. It was just too, too, too similar. Other posters stated this and for a while I thought they were incorrect until I realized why- at first, for the first half of the book I read the bold-face exerpts before each 'story' and this is a nice trick to make you get in the shoes of the newest 'speaker'. But if you skip over these parts, which I did after a while as the story seemed to drag on and on, you realize that yes- each voice sounds exactly the same. Whats more, the vingnettes loose their appeal as you realize, like I did halfway through that you're not going to see these characters again- hence no development, and worse, only a one-sided treatment: only their version of what happened. Lastly, the heavy-handed blatant telling was over-powering after a while, once the style stopped being a distraction- that is, once you feel that each voice sounds the same, all the nuiances of different viewpoints falls away and instead of feeling like you're reading different perspectives, you feel like you're reading an Americanized caricature of people, and that they're just there to serve as space in between each zombie scene. At that point, I had to give the book a 3-star.<br /><br />Great ideas, great scenes, great concept, if only more emphasis had been put on more authenticated personas, or at least revisiting certain characters, or giving different viewpoints of a single event from multiple viewpoints. Reminds me of The Martian Chronicles a bit, only the social commentary that Brooks is giving is heavy-handed and Hollywoodized in every way possible. So, begrudingly, and dissappointedly, 3 stars.Whats more, the vingnettes loose their appeal as you realize, like I did halfway through that you're not going to see these characters again- hence no development, and worse, only a one-sided treatment: only their version of what happened.

B003SOMYNQ|5.0|I read this book for my English class and looking at the cover I thought it might be a pretty okay story but I was definitely wrong! From the very first chapter I was captured by Lee's captivating and mysterious characters. Boo Radley, the classic camp-fire story character, reminded me of the stories I used to hear about monsters in the woods that were located near my house from the way he was portrayed as this secluded person with a strange and twisted history. The end of the story was far from what I expected because of all the plot twists. Scout, the little tomboy narrator of the story, provided the intriguing perspective of a 6-year old girl instead of the usual teen or adult point of view like in other novels. Looking through her eyes at the trial between Tom Robinson and Bob Ewell, I believe, may have let some parents who have read the story know that kids may be kids but they can still see and understand that something bad is going on. Overall I think that this is an outstanding book that everyone should read.

B004132HZS|5.0|If you want to update Sherlock Holmes, there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. The wrong way is to keep Sherlock in the 19th century but turn him into a feral, unsocialized Valley Boy and Dr. Watson into a humorless priss with a gambling problem. This is what Guy Ritchie did in his film, \\"Sherlock Holmes.\\" The right way is to plop Sherlock down in the 21st century and see what he and Dr. Watson (still an Afghanistan war veteran--the more things change, the more they stay the same) can get up to with computers and modern forensics. This is what Mark Gatiss did with the BBC series \\"Sherlock,\\" and the results are superbly thrilling, funny and charming.<br /><br />Make no mistake: there always was an anti-social edge to even the traditional Sherlock. Robert Downey Jr. in the Ritchie version and Benedict Cumberbatch in the Gatiss version both emphasize this aspect of Sherlock's behavior. But Sherlock's salvation was always the sheer elegance of his manners, speech, and thought. Downey, wonderful as he is, doesn't do elegance (and Ritchie would prevent him in any case). Cumberbatch, on the other hand, punches elegance up to the rafters, making his Sherlock a madly entertaining aristocrat of crime-fighting. Martin Freeman's Watson is the perfect foil for Cumberbatch: small and nebbishy, he looks like the sort of person dogs kick, and no one would ever guess that he has an absolutely steady hand in shooting a villain at fifty yards with a service revolver, straight through the eyes.<br /><br />Throughout the three-episode series, Gatiss has great fun updating all the familiar Conan Doyle tropes into a Britain of socialized medicine, MP3s and Chinese take-away. The first episode, \\"A Study in Pink,\\" especially bears comparison with anything Conan Doyle ever wrote; the villain--no fair revealing his identity--is conceived and presented with particular brilliance. With a wonderful cast including Rupert Graves as Inspector Lestrade, Una Stubbs as Mrs. Hudson and Gatiss himself as Mycroft, this \\"Sherlock\\" is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves both traditional and contemporary mysteries., this \\"Sherlock\\" is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves both traditional and contemporary mysteries.

B002VPE1WK|4.0|Purchased this bag about a month back on Amazon.  I was initially interested in purchasing a Canon backpack ( to go with my Canon cameras) but based on user reviews & price, picked this one instead. Delivery from Amazon was on time and the packaging was perfect.  This easily packed the following equipment ( Canon Rebel XT body, Canon 70-300 IS USM lens, Canon 18-55 EF-S lens, Canon 50mm prime lens, Canon EF-430 flash, a flash diffuser and a battery charger.  There was still one more compartment free.  The nice thing about the inside of the bag is that you can easily re-arrange the velcro dividers to create compartments of your preference.  It also comes with a zippered pouch area on the inside and outside to store additional, flat items.  The overall construction looked quite good.  The only con is that the padding is not very thick.  I recently returned the 70-300mm Canon lens and bought a much more expensive 70-200 f/2.8 Canon lens which was much more heavier.  Though this fits in the bag, I'm a bit worried about the the amount of padding available to protect the lens and as a precaution, am using the small air filled plastic bags that Amazon puts into the shipping boxes for added protection.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase.

0061433047|2.0|I have every book that Pratchett wrote, some of which I have not yet read.  I have read the previous three novels in the Tiffany Aching series and enjoyed them all.  I gave each of them to my granddaughter because I thought they were suitable for her age as well as for an adult.  She is now almost eleven years old and an avid reader.  I would not give this book to her.  I feel that his reference to adultery and his choice of words, such as whore, are not suitable for a child.  My reason for the low rating for an author that I have enjoyed reading thoroughly is that I feel that this book Is far below his usual level.  While it seems to include a lot of his style it reads like another author trying to copy it.<br /><br />Bob Miller
B001UV4XFG|3.0|I cannot claim the Twilight series to be my guilty pleasure, because the series has not been all that pleasurable. The directing has been uninspired (strike 3!), the scripts have been both flat and disjointed at the same time, and the special effects have been utterly comical. And yet...I keep watching. The reason I keep coming back for more (and more and more, I'm ashamed to say) is the amazing, undeniable chemistry between Rob and Kristen...er, I mean Bella and Edward. Who cares if there was no explanation of how they got together or how they fell in love. Who cares if it all was rushed, hard to believe, and unexplained. When Rob and Kristen (er, I mean Edward and Bella) are in the same room, they breathe heavier, speak in huskier tones, and flow their words together as if they were in a lusty conversation and not just reading vacuous lines off a half-baked & sanitized script. They (the actors) can make you believe in them as a couple, and beyond that, they can remind you how totally enthralling and exciting the taste of first true love is. But I digress. Back to Eclipse. The \\"newborn\\" vampire plot seemed like some sort of afterthought - thankfully I first saw this on DVD and was able to fast forward through much of that contrived garbage. Jacob and Bella have even less sizzle in this movie than they did in New Moon and it shows, so I fast forwarded through most of their tiresome scenes as well. Sadly, the romance between Edward and Bella seemed forced in this film. The chemistry that was so evident in the first two films (the first especially) was glaringly lacking in this movie, for the most part. I say for \\"the most part\\" because there was one single scene where Bella and Edward made some sort of attempt to bring sexy back, but were thwarted yet again by Stephanie Meyer's prudish ways and poofy music playing in the background. Unfulfilled passion gets old after a while. The final few scenes were intended to be romantic, but came off as goofy and maudlin. That all being said, the often hilarious and irreverent commentary by Rob and Kristen on the bonus DVD make this set worth purchase. The chemistry that was so lacking in the movie made a good, long appearance in the commentary. It was obvious that the actors are friends and that they themselves did not feel this was the best movie to showcase their acting skills. Robert Pattinson's one-liners and witty (if not entirely sober) commentary is especially worthwhile. It's just too bad that you cannot purchase just the commentary disc, because it's really the only disc worth watching more than once. It's also too bad there isn't more Billy Burke in this movie. He must have been instructed to mumble all his lines because I had to crank the audio and/or hit English subtitles to understand what he was saying. But once I understood, I appreciated. I can only hope he gets a bigger piece of the action in the next movie, he's probably the most under-appreciated gem in the whole Twilight series.

You may also experience feelings of excitement, nervousness, sadness, anger, infatuation & most importantly happiness.   This book was the best contemporary fiction I have ever read, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B002ZG980U|1.0|After all the high praise and top critic reviews I am  shocked and disappointed to say that Inception has been added to my 'worse movies ever' list and is in first place.  Twenty minutes into the movie I'm asking myself \\"did I miss something\\"  I had no idea of what was going on.  Disconnected mumble jumble scenes and dialogue and shoot'em up car crash scenes making for a cross between Wyatt Earp and Rambo. An utterly absurb movie that I couldn't finish watching.  I'm happy to say I got a free streaming movie coupon so I didn't waste money on this nonsense but what a waste of a coupon.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|Every year I add another Christmas CD to my collection.  Last year's Sting \\"Winter\\" CD was a dreary disappointment.  A Christmas Cornucopia is a wonderful exception and has quickly become one of my all-time favorites.  On first listen a few things caught my aural attention (God Rest Ye Gentlemen) and then I kept returning and liking what I heard more and more.  This is not a Rosemary Clooney Christmas collection in the traditional sense.  Nor it is like Mariah Carey's vocal gymnastics which leave the songs barely recognizable.   At times it reminds me of a cross between Paul Simon's \\"Graceland\\" with exotic rhythms and Linda Ronstadt's \\"A Very Merry Little Christmas\\" (another holiday favorite).  There is no Santa Claus is Coming to Town here, the music is Christmas choral traditional in nature. The juxtaposition is enticing and exciting to the listener, a Christmas cornucopia is the perfect title!  I almost did not buy this CD because of published reviews I had read and I am so glad I did.  This is a beautiful music experience and not to be missed.  I am not sure if I can stop listening to it after the Christmas season has passed.  Thank you Annie for you are a Angel in the Realm of Glory.
014241543X|5.0|I like to think of myself as a generally cheerful person. That's why I tend to veer away from anything depressing. I don't like to be reminded of the sorrow and pain that goes on in our world. I dubbed the news \\"the bad news\\" because there never seems to be anything good on it. My denial goes so far that it stops me from reading or watching movies with a sad undertone. Yet, once in a while, I will let something unhappy fall into the bubble of sunshine I work hard to maintain. If I Stay by Gayle Forman is one of those books. I cannot bring myself to regret reading this captivating tale, because it revealed a world that I tried to pretend didn't exist.<br /><br />Seventeen year old Mia's world is overrun with choices. Her love of music threatens to pull her away from her family and friends. She wants to take her talents across the country to New York City. She wants to play in Lincoln Center and feel the power of commanding an audience with nothing more than a cello. She wants to be a musician.<br /><br />But, then there is another part of her that rejects the idea. It pulls her away from the glitz and glamour of the City and keeps her with her family. She wants to stay with them. She wants to spend time with her best friend. She wants to hold onto her boyfriend, Adam, for as long as she possibly can. She doesn't want to let go.<br /><br />Mia's life is ripping at the seams, torn between Oregon and New York. A fresh start or an old home. Her love for music or her love for her family and friends. Could she sacrifice one in exchange for the other without breaking her heart in the process?<br /><br />Suddenly, that doesn't matter anymore. A tragic accident changes everything in a blink of an eye. If I Stay by Gayle Forman is not the kind of book you pick up for light reading. You must proceed with caution, care, and tissues.<br /><br />These precautions don't mean you shouldn't read it, though. The writing is beautiful, and Mia truly leaps off the page. The struggle to choose between one love or another is often poked fun at in romantic comedies. Yet, they no longer seem funny after you see the struggle through Mia's eyes. Gayle Forman weaves this tale in such a way that you are forced to decide with Mia. She makes the reader feel the agony of this decision and the bittersweet relief of finally making a choice.<br /><br />If I Stay truly puts life in perspective. It ripped me out of my comfortable happy life, and into a world filled with the melancholy sound of Mia's cello. Truly, the best way to describe this novel is through music. The screeching tune of conflict scratches at our ears and makes us beg for resolution. Then, suddenly, the chords blend together. The stars are aligned to form a happy ending. If I Stay proves that only through conflict can we really appreciate the harmonious sounds of true happiness.<br /><br />by Victoriaen poked fun at in romantic comedies.

B0001XPY1G|4.0|I'm not a Jackson 5 fan,, but did enjoy most of this CD.  I prefer to just listen to Michael, but it is nice to  occasionally hear him at that young age, such a super talent!
B0043KK4N6|5.0|After watching one of my idols, Cher, in her latest movie I immediately purchased the soundtrack to \\"Burlesque\\" in which she co-stars with Christina Aguilera. I was surprised at how good the CD is as I am not really a huge fan of Christina's. I have to admit that she has, though, an amazing voice with emotional range for a singer so young. Christina carries the bulk of the tracks on the album (with eight songs) where Cher only records two. That is really the only problem I have with the \\"Burlesque\\" soundtrack. It would have been nice if both singers would have recorded an equal number of singles for the album, but I am not complaining. The two released by Cher (her first new recordings in seven years) are the jewels here, especially the Diane Warren-penned \\"You haven't Heard The Last Of Me\\". Warren wrote Cher's comeback song \\"If I Could Turn Back Time\\" in the late eighties and it's obvious from the vocals of Cher's on this song that Warren wrote it especialy for her. Cher's voice is raw, vibrant, and extremely strong, especially for a woman who is nearing 65. After following her career for decades I have to say her performance on this one song is probably the best work she has ever done. The song is about a performer who has reached the peak of her success with many believing she is washed-up, never to succeed again, but the singer states she will always be around and successful due to her determination and will-power. \\"You Haven't Heard The Last Of Me Yet\\" has already become a huge hit in the club circuit debuting at #35 on the Billboard Dance Charts.<br /><br /> I am also extremely impress by some of the performances of Christina's. Highlights of her songs include \\"Show Me Some Burlesque\\", \\"Something's Got A Hold Of Me\\", and \\"Bound To You\\". Trust me: even if your not a fan of Christina's you will become one after listening to \\"Burlesque\\". Aguilera is a young performer with an obvious drive to become a cult icon and working alongside the great Cher is not an easy task, but Christina holds her own both in the film and on the soundtrack.<br /><br /> \\"Burlesque\\" has debut at #18 on the Billboard Pop Album Charts selling 63,000 copies in its first week of release and selling an additional 108,623 copies in its second week signalling its immediate success as a movie soundtrack album.t Christina holds her own both in the film and on the soundtrack.     \\"Burlesque\\" has debut at #18 on the Billboard Pop Album Charts selling 63,000 copies in its first week of release and selling an additional 108,623 copies in its second week signalling its immediate success as a movie soundtrack album.

B003ZHQVJO|3.0|Trying hard to get into this album, but it's not working for me. Wanted to love it...but don't. What happened to the Kid's ability to Rock?  Guess cross-over country rockabilly offerings appeal to a wider audience and sell more disks.  Played Picture, Cowboy and Forever at my wedding 4 yrs ago, and had the place jumping with the guests demanding more...none of the tracks on this disk come even close to those.  Catchy tunes Purple Sky and When It Rains are the two best on the album.  Miss the bad boy rocker edge of previous albums big time....hopefully his future concerts focus on the oldies but goodies and down play this mass market pulp...but will always love the KID.

I found it informative and definitely an interesting read for people in the industry and those that are just plain interested in Social Media.  Social Media is playing a major role in our day-to-day life - whether it is communicating with friends, sharing photos, gathering news or finding a job.  It is fun to have a solid understanding of what's happening in the space and this book provides that.
B0029LHWKO|4.0|I'm sure a writer would tell you that it is not necessary to experience the things he/she writes about, but how McCullers wrote this story, at 23, is beyond me, though some of the themes she dwells on - isolation, loneliness - she no doubt suffered as a sickly musical prodigy.  The characters in this novel will haunt you.  Her prose is spare and lyrical.  Describing the desperate lives of the townspeople during the coldest winter in memory:  \\"The people dreamed and fought and slept as much as ever.  And by habit they shortened their thoughts so that they would not wander out into the darkness beyond tomorrow.\\"    Take your time; read it slowly. You will not regret it.
B0037KMHRY|3.0|I was so excited to get this movie soundtrack after having heard the music at Disneyland California Adventure ElecTRONica event.. Upon getting the CD I played it for the first time in my car stereo of which is top of the line!.. What I found was at least 6 or so tracks were recorded at a low volume which prevented me from cranking up the volume as much as I would have liked to!.. It was so good I wanted to blow out the windows of my car but with the volume maxxed out it was impossible due to the low master recording volume... Same sound quality on my home stereo system.    I also notices a fuzzy static sound constant throughout the CD...I pretty much have to turn the treble all the way down to eliminate it which in doing so takes quality away from the music again.    Very disappointed with the sound quality on these CDs. Hope it was a bad lot and is corrected as I will gladly buy another one for Daft Punks performance!  The music is a masterpiece!  Love it but its just too bad it has inconsistentcies in quality.
B002ZIAC26|4.0|This is the album that will make this duo famous. Their two previous albums look like a continuous monotonous music but Teen Dream is what they can do best. Most of the tracks are hits, incredible. Perfect, I listened over and over.<br />They sound like a complete new band!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|My sister and I enjoyed this movie so much we saw it 5 times and were ready to go see it again. The acting was excellent, very believable. The racing scenes were exciting, putting you right in the action.  We had the privilege of visiting Secretariat in 1984 at Claiborne Farm in Paris, KY. He was a real show off. He could spot a camera as quickly as a carrot and enjoyed posing for pictures. He loved people and connected with them.  The movie did a good job in trying to portray his special personality and his crowd appeal (as well as you could without the real Secretariat playing himself.)  This is a first rate movie. I would have bought the DVD if they had been selling it in the theatre lobby!!
B0036EH3XE|5.0|My favorite thing about LOST was its ability to continually surprise me, even when I thought I had it all figured out.  Same goes for the box set - it's un-freaking-believable! Obviously for the DVDs, but also the game pieces, the Black Rock diary, the Ankh, etc, it's just a perfectly packaged product. My favorite extras were the \\"Letting Go\\" tour of Oahu, the prop special, and on-location stories from cast and crew. I can't get enough of the behind-the-scenes interviews with the cast and crew.     I also suggest [[ASIN:B003FGWZVI Lost: 2010 PaleyFest]] with 100 minutes of awesome discussion and funny stories from Nestor Caronell, Michael Emerson, Terry O'Quinn, and more for anyone who loves the behind-the-scenes stuff.

B002ZG981E|5.0|My comments about the film are focused on Hans Zimmer's score, and not the film itself. Many others have discussed the merits and demerits of this movie. I find myself a partisan of it - in conception and execution it is, with one notable exception, an intelligent and entertaining film which I recommend highly, especially in its bluray incarnation. However...    As a professional composer who has also had a lifelong interest in \\"movie music\\" (Bernard Herrmann was a correspondent and teacher), I often find myself assaulted by what I will call \\"The Curse of John Williams.\\" Williams is a very gifted composer, both of film music and of concert works as well, but the wall-to-wall music film-score aesthetic which he brought back into fashion beginning with Star Wars in 1977 has long since morphed into the standard method whereby film composers approach their tasks under the fashion that says, in effect, \\"people are stupid and need aural cues at every possible moment to tell them what to think and how to feel.\\" Thus, especially in the realm of fantasy and science-fiction, we have an endless stream of film scores whose opening title to end title continuity leave me utterly exhausted, aurally fatigued by the incessant blather of overcooked, hyperventilating accompaniments whose minimalist compositional techniques have all but destroyed the effect of music in film.    Bernard Herrmann's operating principal was \\"less is more\\" - an attitude developed during his pre-Hollywood years as a composer of scores for radio dramas. When he made the transition to film, his overriding sense of economy and brevity made his contributions to the various films he scored all the more effective precisely because they were not constant - because they were present only when the dramaturgical flow of the film required the additional aural element to complete the visual. Herrmann was one of the very first minimalist composers, long before John Adams, Terry Riley, Philip Glass, and all the other minimalists came on the scene, indeed before minimalism was a definable musical technique. As we know, minimalism became an end in and of itself, and not a means to an end. Our current crop of Hollywood composers have largely if not entirely, it seems to me, bought into the utter and total corruption of Herrmann's \\"less is more\\" and have turned it into \\"more less is more.\\"    The most recent, and for my money, egregious example of this is Hans Zimmer's score for the Christopher Nolan film \\"Inception.\\" When I saw the film in its \\"live\\" environment, that is, in the movie house, Zimmer's score, never for a minute approaching anything even remotely subtle or understated, was intrusive in a way that seemed to have crossed over into new territories of aural overkill. When I acquired the recently released BluRay version of the film, and then watched it on my home theater system, both my wife and I were overwhelmed by the sheer chutzpah, the noise level, the unceasing repetition, over and over and over again, of the same musical figures absolutely without development, extension or variation. The phenomenal clarity of both the visual and audio elements drove home the point that this score, for all its synthesized and \\"live\\" musical elements, was totally inappropriate both in terms of conception and execution. It was often impossible for us to hear dialogue clearly, even though the bluray realization places most all of the dialogue clearly in the center front channels. I cannot fathom Nolan's approval of this kind of overkill. But I am reminded of the story Herrmann told about his adventures with William Friedkin when Friedkin asked him to score The Exorcist. Herrmann was, if nothing else, perhaps the single most original and imaginative film composer - and when he told Friedkin that he would use many French Horns in the score, Friedkin told him that he didn't want anything French in the music! Utter stupidity and ignorance there for a certainty. Zimmer's patented overkill strikes me as director Nolan's equivalent.    Now Zimmer is indeed a talented composer even as his scores have their characteristic bloated overstatement. But, with Inception, the score is so exaggerated and the presentation, especially in 7 channel bluray, so intrusive as to destroy what is otherwise a marvelously ingenious and engrossing film. I am not stupid. I don't need the Wagnerian leit-motiv method pushed beyond the outer limits. I do not ever want music in a film to overwhelm absolutely every other element. And, I certainly don't want to walk away from a film annoyed to the point of distraction by a score which shows not a whit of respect for the audience listening to it in the context for which it was composed.    I protest!
B0042JTDXK|5.0|This is the voice Josh Groban was born to sing with.  He sounds so much more mature, with fewer pop quirks and more timeless appeal. So much music these days is of the heard-it-one-time-you've-heard-all-there-is-to-hear variety. I just keep listening to this one over and over.  There's a lot of music and a lot of meaning in the lyrics. It seems very personal and heart-felt.  I can't understand complaints about his falsetto.  It's amazing, sweet, and perfect, just like this album.

0525423273|5.0|***As originally posted on my blog Ticket to Anywhere***<br /><br />ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS by Stephanie Perkins is a book that I first heard about on Twitter where it seemed like everyone was buzzing about. This peaked my curiosity and I hated that I would have to wait until it was released to read it. Then the book gods smiled on me and not only did a friend send me her copy to read but I also received a copy for review from the publisher. I went from a serious Anna drought to positively bursting with copies and I knew I wouldn't be able to wait to read it.<br /><br />For me, the book started off a little slow and I was wondering what all the fuss was about. Then at some point, I can't even begin to tell you when it happened, I just got so completely and utterly sucked into this story. I loved all the characters - Anna is just brilliant and &Eacute;tienne is so flawed and confused and so totally swoon worthy. The supporting cast were also all so wonderfully drawn that everyone felt real and dare I mention the setting? Most of the book takes place in Paris, France where Anna is sent to boarding school because her father (a Nicolas Sparks-like author) thinks the experience will be good for her. Anna initially thinks this is a great tragedy because 1) she doesn't speak French and 2) its her senior year and she's been exiled from her friends, her almost boyfriend and her best friend. But then she meets Meredith, Josh, Rashmi and &Eacute;tienne (known as St Clair to his friends.)<br /><br />Anna adjusts to life in France and delights in learning all the wonders that the city holds. She also becomes drawn to St Clair and he to her. But this isn't your straight boy meets girl love story because St Clair has a girlfriend. You then get this tragically beautifully story where everyone is trying to do the right thing...or what they think is the right thing...and so there are denials and miss-communications and even some missed opportunities. As a reader you want there to be a happily ever after but at the same time you don't want any of the characters to become a douche and hurt anyone else just so that they can find happiness.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins is such an amazingly gifted writer and she conveys so much information about each character without them saying too much about themselves. Through their actions she shows all their little quirks and mannerisms and its these little details that really turn the characters from 2D words on a page into 3D people that you see just out of the corner of your eye as you read. In the end, ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS, made my heart ache. Not in a bad way but in that oh so wonderful way it does every time I read Pride and Prejudice. I am so glad that Perkins wrote this book and that I was able to read it. I am so glad that its now out there in the world so that other people can know just how wonderful this story is. This is a book that I had to run out and buy when it was released because just having the ARC wasn't enough. Its a book that I have bullied people to read and one that has made my Top 12 List.<br /><br />I am truly amazed that ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS is Perkins's debut novel because its just so brilliantly executed. ANNA is one of those few books that I could gush about forever. Its earned its place on my permanent bookshelf and I know that it is a book that will be re-read several times. Its a story that I wished would never end because I don't think that I could ever get tired of these characters. Which is why I'm so excited that even there will be two companion books, titled LOLA AND THE BOY NEXT DOOR (Fall 2011) and ISLA AND THE HAPPILY EVER AFTER (2012). I can't wait! But until those books are in stores you really should go out and buy Anna. I think that everyone should read it and I can't recommend it enough. So go forth and now the awesome that is ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS.<br /><br />***As originally posted on my blog Ticket to Anywhere***e time you don't want any of the characters to become a douche and hurt anyone else just so that they can find happiness.

1439181780|5.0|The Bible, says that God is Love. Quantum physics says that God is energy. That energy is brought forth into our existence every day and we are the transformers of that energy. If we use our feelings and emotions to translate that energy into a negative force, then we live our lives in a negative way. If we transform that energy into LOVE, or should I say allow it to come into the world as ITSELF, then we live a positive life. Rhonda has an understanding that isn't perfect (are any of us?) and yet is so well explained that she IS a channel for love to come into the world. And that LOVE is badly needed in these times. I was inspired by her book so much that I am purchasing 3 more copies to give to other people I feel can benefit from the book. I have been reading a lot lately about Energy medicine and much of what I am seeing is that taping into Pure Awareness is the key to obtaining the LOVE that you can utilize to carry out the precepts that Rhonda has listed in this book that has come from her heart. Personally, I wouldn't have listed the quote right in the middle of the writings due to the way they distract from the flow of thought. Maybe at the end or the beginning, but not in the middle. Otherwise I still say her book deserves a five. For if more of mankind would put these PRINCIPLES to work, there would be much less strife, road rage, divorce, war, famine and all of the \\"problems\\" that seem to plague mankind. I highly recommend this book for those of you who are seeking the why's of life.     If my wife had not left me, I don't know if I would have ever read this book. And guess what? The law of attraction has been slowly, in her time, bringing her back to me. The chapter on relationships and the keys have helped her and I the most. Who needs a councilor if you can have, believe and USE the POWER OF LOVE!
B003XTUZIM|3.0|Is it just me, does each remastering of CDs yield less and less dynamics, more compression?  It is very evident on my favorite Crismo album of all time.  The dynamics are missing!!  I go back and play my original LP and DAMN!!  It is startling how much more dynamic and powerful it is than this release. I play older CD versions and they are better in the dynamic range department.  If we wanted to have compression we would look for the mp3 versions!!  Keep the resolution and dynamics (both macro and micro) intact please!

B003XKPPOU|4.0|I am always facinated with Pixar movies.  I tried to collect most of them during the DVD era.  After puchasing a blu ray player couple of months ago, Toy Story 3 was one of the blu ray discs I wanted to use to \\"test\\" the difference between DVD and BD, resolution-wise.  Since I also have a new Yamaha RX-667 receiver which is capable of playing 7.1 signals, I also purchased Klipsch surround back speakers to compliment my existing Klipsch HT speaker line up. Once set up, I used the Toy Story 3's option of \\"maximizing home theater experience\\" by testing the 7.1 channel set up.  To my surprise, it does not send signals to the surround back speakers during the individual speaker test.  Instead, each surround speaker (not the surround back speakers) will test twice.  The receiver has been set up for the surround back speakers and calibrated using the YPAO.  Not sure if the advertisement of Toy Story 3 as a 7.1 channel movie is a fluke or what. Anybody out there experienced the same?
B002VECM6S|5.0|The Blind Side is an inspirational film of a woman who takes to heart James 1:27, \\"to look after orphans... in their distress.\\" Michael Oher is an XXL African American teenager with a messed-up past and a miniscule GPA. This boy is on his own with no place to call home and nothing to call his own but a grocery bag containing a spare shirt. On the other end of the spectrum, we have Leigh Anne Tuohy- an upper class, middle age, white woman. In this heart-warming, real life story, Leigh Anne Tuohy humbly reaches out to care for \\"Big Mike\\" despite the flak she may receive from those around her. I think she demonstrates a great picture of the love of Christ as she gives of herself, not expecting anything in return. The Tuohy family is not by any means perfect, yet the viewer gets a glance into their souls to see that faith in Jesus is the primary factor in their generosity.

However, her part is seriously underwritten. Mostly, she strikes poses in a flat characterization of the bitch-boss. The majority of screen time is focused on the heroine, played by Anne Hathaway, who has not a comedic bone in her body. The supporting characters are no better, in that the talented ones are underwritten and the rest are just plain dull.

030726999X|3.0|Given the multitude of reviews that aptly summarize what this book is about, I'll just say that The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest is an admirable conclusion to Stieg Larsson's highly successful trilogy. On the plus side, the book provides a credible, mostly satisfying wrap-up of the various plots and sub-plots carried forward from the first two books in the series. Further, the concluding 150-200 pages provide a fast-paced, satisfying read. However, the reading experience leading up to the concluding pages was often tedious and, at times, boring. The primary reason for this is that Larsson filled the book with a lot of minutiae, too much detail and so many minor characters that I felt I needed a scorecard to keep track of who's who. The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest would have, in my opinion, greatly benefited from some serious editing that resulted in the book being at least 100 pages shorter. For me, this book is a good example of where \\"less would have been more.\\" In addition, while the book is generally satisfying, it basically lacks suspense and is predictable. There's no way that most readers of the first two books in this series aren't going to want to read The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest and will likely be satisfied with the experience overall. But, before doing so, be forewarned that this book is very unevenly paced and, for the most part, slow-paced (especially during the first third).
B00428ZRFE|3.0|Rihanna has been known for her upbeat and energetic music, up until Rated R, which, to me was a great change of pace. Unfortunately for Rihanna, this \\"Loud\\" c.d fell short. In my opinion her best c.d by far was Good Girl Gone Bad. This c.d attempts to live up to it's predecessor but doesn't quite deliver. There are songs worth listening to though. I like \\"Raining Men\\" a very good beat with lyrics that carry it well. I also like \\"California King Bed\\". If you want the old Rihanna, you won't find it here. You will find an album that was rushed into production, and the quality reflects it.
B0041VT6HW|5.0|this was a great movie...the plot was good the effects were good and the acting was good..what more can you ask for
B001EN71DG|5.0|I really wish the product description for this box set was better on here. It really doesn't explain that there are TWO versions of each movie: Disc 1 is the latest \\"special\\" edition with commentary and all that jazz AND Disc 2 is the original theatrical version. So really, there's a little something for everyone from the person that likes the special edition to the purist who likes the original version.
B003INBNXO|5.0|I originally rented this movie from a red box having heard that it had the kind of action I might be interested in.  The character IP Man played by Donnie Yen was amazing!  His calm attitude and his fighting style was spectacular!  The story was pretty good. The only thing I did not like so much was that sometimes when the Japanese people talked it didn't give out subtitles.  But the overall dubbing was great!  Doesn't seem like it was dubbed because of how nicely the voices matched up with the characters' mouths.  Once I finished the movie I automatically had to go out and get it!  I went out onto the web and found Amazon had a great price for this dvd.  (Don't ever buy dvd's from ebay even though you see a lower price!!--They're usually copyright infringed which also means that the quality sucks!  When my Amazon dvd of IP Man came I was surprised to see how perfect the overall package was!  Very satisfied!!<br /><br /> Best martial arts movie in my collection!!
B004EDS72M|4.0|Most of the old cast is in this episode which I like/prefer and Linda Hamilton with one of the 2000 era James Bond movie stars Timothy Dalton(he still has it)!

B000UR9T8C|4.0|Aaah, Spider-Man 3. The black sheep of the series. The one fanboys seem to hate more than anything else. It's been almost six years since it came out, and is one of the most divided movies ever. It has its fair share of flaws, and misses a beat here or there, but for what it does good, it does great, and what it doesn't...well it somewhat falters, but still is a fun experience. This is definitely the worst of the trilogy, but is a fun last ride for Raimi and co., before the reboot for ASM, which seemed more like a retelling of Spider-Man than its own beast. Enjoyable, flawed, and with great action scenes and themes of forgiveness, I wouldn't pass on this one. Thanks Sam, Tobey, and the rest of the cast and Crew. 4 stars.

Though it is smashed up in your face it is still not as bad as the 1997 remasters and the overall sound is bright and crisp. needless to say the music is timeless.

0060936223|5.0|Just Kids explains the Beat and Punk generations with writing that's inspiringly new. Patti offers it as a first autobiography structured around her friendship with \\"black and white\\" photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. She also shares her encounters with her art, poetry, and music influences, to an expanded-conscious appreciation of how an artist is guided. For example, meeting one of her literary mentors, Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, who buys her a sandwich and later, \\"he once asked how I would describe how we met. 'I would say you fed me when I was hungry,' I told him. And he did.\\" (p. 123). She relates her flash epiphany, while watching Jim Morrison and the Doors live, that she too could express herself by performing her poems as lyrics set to music. No wonder she was honored with a 2010 National Book Award.
0545123275|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It's not just for young adults, it is for all ages. It's heartwarming and beautifully written. The multiple points of view are interesting. You always wonder in a first person book what the other main characters are thinking, in this book you know. The wolves are so magnetic, you can't help but want to learn more about them in general.
0756656230|5.0|My daughters checked out the Standing Small book from the library and they really liked it, so I bought the set for my nephew who is 8.  At first, I was afraid that he would not like it, but after he looked it at awhile, he really did seem excited about it.  The next day when we saw him he was carrying it with him.  I think this is a gift that, for him at least, he will appreciate it more over time.  It is neat to see all the characters that Lego has made over the years, and all the sets too.  I would recommend it for anyone who is really into Legos.
B001DDBCUA|4.0|I was a little disappointed the first time I saw this but the second time helped and I enjoyed looking at the fashions and clothing.  I have every single episode, so I know the characters well.  There is a little bit too much hugging and screaming for joy in this movie - but if you love the gals like I do, you will enjoy it.
030726999X|5.0|I couldn't wait for this one to come out in paperback and Amazon had the best price by far.  The last book in this series is great!  Loved it.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. I appreciated how the author gave his back story, and his descriptions of events. Providing pertinent and what I found to be important details. In some part I think this may have been embellished. I mean how accurately can someone, even a seasoned writter, keep track of minute details of the crazy experiences like he had?  Even with that little caveat, I still very much enjoyed this read and have begun to really, really, enjoy my runs. In a whole spirit kind of way. Even got into the Vibram, barefoot running trend. It's awesome!  Try it, you'll enjoy this book.  Much love and peace to you.
B0043URV8M|4.0|I am a huge fan of John Williams and and even bigger Harry Potter fan. That being said I think that Alexandre Desplat captured the feel of the movie in the dark and sometimes haunting themes of Deathly Hallows. The light magical feel of the earlier books and films are long gone and the extensive use of the percussion section for Hallows was appropriate. The track Farewell to Dobby was poignant and emotional. I would have loved to hear a little more of Hedwig's Theme but if I am being honest there really wasn't too many places in the film where it would have fit.     All in all Alexandre Desplat's Deathly Hallows part one, though not John Williams music, is leaps and bounds better than Patrick Doyle's Goblet of Fire and as good or even a little better than Nicholas Hooper's Order of the Phoenix and Half Blood Prince.
6305781427|5.0|I remember seeing this fantastic production when it was first aired here in the US back in the 90's. The music and presentation were absolutely first class with the most impressive part being the way the composer and musicians were able to project their hearts and souls within the music itself. I ran out to purchase the VHS version as soon as it became available.  I'm happy to have it on DVD now as my VHS was pretty worn out.  Just be aware that there is another version of this concert BUT IT IS MISSING several of the selections contained on this DVD.    I also wanted to say that it's unfortunate that one reviewer was so distracted by Yanni \\"swooning and jerking\\" that he gave the music and performance low marks, but then that reviewer probably has no idea what it feels like to have the power and beauty of the music engulfing you and flowing through you, especially as you perform your own creations before an audience and feel that indefinable bond between you and them as you see their expressions and know that your music is touching the hearts and souls of so many. Speaking from experience, it is the music itself that fills you, flows through you and moves you, and if you're not repressed, you may be moved to show your feelings as you perform. You really can get lost in the music itself.  Heck you see that type of \\"swooning and jerking\\" in the performances of  lots of musicians from all genres of music whether rock and roll, hip-hop, country-western, New Age or whatever. They are simply moved by the music and their art.    In any case, this is the best DVD version of this concert I've found and it has all the pieces that were in the broadcast.  There's another version of the DVD that's available with the CD but it does NOT have all the selections this version does.    Video quality was excellent, crisp and clear. We had no trouble seeing the faces of all the performers even on some of the long shots.
0525951652|4.0|Loved this book! I was very impressed with how well Follett intertwined his fictional story with actual historic events. My only complaint is that I felt like the ending was just kind of thrown together, I think it could have been much more detailed or stronger than what it was.<br /><br />Also it's irritating that so many people gave this book a bad review just because of the kindle price. Reviews should be based on the quality of the product, not how much it costs. If the price is that big of an issue, don't buy it then!
B00428ZRFE|5.0|I ordered and within 3 days I had received the product in the condition stated prior to purchase. I definitely recommend this seller!
0811875555|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this book and the artwork included therein. Glen Keane is one of the most dynamic and expressive artists out there and the other artists included here are phenomenal as well. Paintings and sketches are topnotch.
0312600844|1.0|Our couples book group selected this book for a recent meeting, but we decided to go to a local Film Festival because most of us were not able to get through the book and did not want to discuss it.  I was quickly completely bored with the story, and could not turn another page.  The dialogue was completely senseless and the characters unappealing.  I was not willing to continue to waste my time. One husband did finish the book.  I asked him, \\"What is this book about?\\"  He really couldn't answer and he normally has an answer to any question.  When I asked, \\"Did you like any of the characters?\\"  He replied, \\"No, there were no likeable ones.\\"  I'm amazed at the reviews by people who felt the same way but somehow managed to keep reading.  Skip \\"Freedom\\".  It's a thumbs down.
0061997811|5.0|As an avid Harry Potter fan, I was hesitant to order this book for fear of being disappointed.  I am so happy now that I took the chance!  The book offers insight as to how the films were made, the thoughts and feelings of the cast and crew, as well as wonderful bits and pieces of Hogwarts memorabilia.  If you're a fan of the books and movies, you will not regret this purchase.  Delightful!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Oh my F-ING goodness. This book was amazing. I normally take 2-3 months to read a book this size. I ate through this book in less than a month. And I want MORE! The characters are likable and relateable. Sanderson creates a since of drama and suspense in the book that you HAVE to read to find out more. And then, just when you think your going somewhere, HE MOVES TO ANOTHER CHARACTER! AND YOU DONT MIND!!!!    Man, I can't wait for this storming book to have a sequal. IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW!!!!!!
B0044KU7KU|3.0|Well, as much of you have heard or read the interviews with members of the band, you might as well heard that they wanted to go back to its origins, they wanted to write music that sounded like their firsts albums, well, they didn't, it's not that I don't like the album, it's more that I expected something else, I expected to hear again what made me fan of MCR, I wanted them to do what they do best.
B004FCEFUK|5.0|Seventh Wonder does it again. Just downloaded yesterday. Excellent!!! If your into prog metal / metal / hard rock or just love great music, download this now.     Awesome clean vocals (No overplayed cookie monster growling if that sort of thing makes you cringe). Melodic with excellent musicianship.    If you love Dream Theater / Queensryche / Circus Maximus / Serenity / Kamelot / Darkwater etc... you really should take a listen. This is right up your alley.
B0037KMHRY|3.0|First off, I'm a huge TRON fan and when I learned that Disney was returning to an all-but forgotten film of the early 80's, truly ground breakingly way ahead of its time to feature the very first CGI, albeit archaic akin to glorifed vector graphics by today's standards, to a society that didn't even know it (how could they? it would be at least another 10 years before computers were considered a household tool). Second, I'm not a Daft Punk fan. Nothing personal, dance/electronica just isn't my cup of tea but I do think they were a perfect choice in the context of this film so I will remain objective.<br /><br />Like most sci-fi/action effects movies, they tend have really one or two main themes that run through the entirety of their respective soundtracks with only a slight change of tempo or some additional rhythems blended in with the reoccurring main theme. This is nothing new. John Williams is infamous for doing just this in most of his movie compositions but most notably, Star Wars.... and Daft Punk's TRON: Legacy soundtrack is no exception, which is perfectly fine. They do throw in a couple of fast beats, like 'Derezzed' and 'End Of Line', which could be considered throw-away filler tracks on any of their normal album releases but I'm sure they fit the context of the sequences in the film in which they are featured but on the soundtrack, detatched from the film, I find them to a bit weak and actually disrupt the flow of the rest of the soundtrack.<br /><br />The themes here are soft, hypnotic beats and tones that really immerse the listener into a visionary world of a microprocessing network or \\"The Grid\\" that feels cold, calculating and overall menacing yet simultaneously beautiful. I was excited about this movie before. Having given this soundtrack about 4 or 5 listens now, my enthusiasm just got 'amped' up.<br /><br />I think what I like most about this soundtrack is that it doesn't overindulge with heaping piles of unnecessary layers. Imagine a minimalistPhillip Glass.<br />Daft Punk's first outing into the world of movie soundtrack composition is by no means Genious or Instant Classic but it's effective. As the title of my review states, it's \\"competent\\". I look forward hearing more of their work in future movies. I just hope Daft Punk doesn't get relegated to doing just Sci-Fi/Techie films.<br /><br />As for the \\"heavily inspired\\" part of this album, when I heard it for the first time, I immediately thought 'Koyaanisqatsi' meets 'Escape From New York'. The more I listened the more apparent the connection became. Whether it was inentional or not, I felt it both fit the underlying theme of the TRON story as well as a general tip-of-the-hat to obscure action/sci-fi films of the late 70's/early 80's.<br /><br />It's not great but it's different and very accessable. Although I only gave it 3 Stars, I still recommend it as a \\"BUY\\" to everyone.
B0043A0PXU|3.0|I'm a lifelong Annie Lennox fan and was excited about the release of this album. However, upon listening to it the first time through I couldn't help but think, \\"This is the ANGRIEST Christmas album I've ever listened to!\\"  Another reviewer said Annie seems to be at \\"full throttle\\" throughout the album and that's a spot-on description. And yet I have already listened to the album several times over because the arrangements are interesting and different and INTENSE. Annie Lennox never ceases to fascinate the listener even if she is scaring the pants off you in a few songs. \\"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\\" sounds like she's storming the ramparts and if you don't lift a glass to holiday cheer she's going to kick your ass. \\"Coventry Carol\\" also has that intensity, but it works. The way \\"Il est né\\" is repeated in an atonal fashion shows Annie can be scary and intense in French, too. It's only on the last three songs that the throttle is pulled back a bit. \\"Universal Child\\" is haunting, lush and touchingly tender. It's a relief after the vehemence of the rest of the album. There is definitely passion in this recording which makes it worth purchasing and enjoying. Just do as she says and back away slowly!
160788657X|5.0|I was listening to Hell's Corner while doing some housework and after about thirty minutes I had to sit down.  I became so wrapped up in the story that it became the only thing I could concentrate on.  David tells a fantastic story with deep characters.  I give it five stars.
B001VNB54A|4.0|We could not review product due to no blue ray dvd recorder/player. Sold item online & repurchased \\"The Pacific\\" in a non-blue ray format. Series was good but not to the same caliber of \\"The Band of Brothers\\"  I guess because it followed only three main charaters rather than a platoon or company of interacting charaters (real Marines or Soldiers). Both miniseries brought back both good and bad memories of my time served with a great bunch of guys of which many did not return home or in whole. I, like many other of my fellow vets, still suffer the looses more so than the good times but glad we served with the heros that did not come home or in whole body & mind.
159448385X|2.0|I loved Kite Runner and maybe I expected too much from this book when I read it when it first came out, but it doesn't measure up to his first novel.  The story may be interesting, but it really drags in a lot of the book.  I trudged through it, but I would have skipped it if I'd known.  Next time I'll wait until there are reviews, but most of the reviews on Amazon are overly nice for the book.

Save your money and time and pass this one up.
0399215921|4.0|Eric Carle, best known for his breakout entomological bildungsroman, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, seems to present a simple parable about the value of hard work in his 1984 picture book, The Very Busy Spider.  But in contrast to The Very Hungry Caterpillar's universal themes of youthful overindulgence and transcendent maturity, The Very Busy Spider, when examined in its sociopolitical context, captures the zeitgeist of Ronald Reagan's \\"Morning in America,\\" reflecting both the optimism and ambivalence of the era.<br /><br />The protagonist of the story, an industrious female spider who floats onto a farmyard on a breeze from parts unknown, sets out to spin the web that will be both her home and her means of securing sustenance.  The spinning process is threatened, however, by interruptions from a parade of gadabout farm animals who try to tempt her with offers to \\"go for a ride,\\" \\"jump on the rocks,\\" or \\"roll in the mud.\\"  Our workaholic heroine studiously ignores these wastrels, refusing to even acknowledge them with a word of greeting.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert* Finally, after the web is finished and the distractions have abated, she traps a fly, presumably devours it (although no illustrations support this assumption), and then goes to sleep.  Her final visitor, an owl, swoops down to admire her web, but she is too exhausted to bask in his praise.<br /><br />As a comment on the American public's growing animosity toward the welfare state in the eighties, The Very Busy Spider could not be any more succinct.  In a series of eight one-sided conversations in which each animal entreats the spider to join it on some sort of pointless lark and the spider does not answer because she is \\"very busy spinning her web,\\" Carle suggests that independent entrepreneurs, whose success depends on their willingness to make sacrifices and work past the point of physical fatigue to gain their economic foothold, feel they can brook no interference from those who while away their lives at the expense of the state.  The spider can ill afford to pass the time with these domesticated beasts lest she be brought down to their level: feeding at the trough of the farmer, wallowing in their own filth, shirking responsibility whenever possible, and ultimately being led to slaughter.<br /><br />When the only other undomesticated animal in the story, the owl, admires the spider's craftsmanship and work ethic, the spider's unawareness of the compliment bespeaks a quiet dignity inherent in those who make their own way in the world.  They don't need to talk about their achievements because they are too busy building upon them.<br /><br />But The Very Busy Spider is no unequivocal celebration of the entrepreneurial spirit.  The spider is, by her own choosing, an isolated figure in the barnyard community; and nowhere is this more apparent than in the last image in the book.  Her web, the product of her expertise and industry, is the farmyard equivalent of the glass and steel monuments to obsessive acquisition that glitter in the Manhattan skyline.  And yet the spider herself is barely visible, tucked away in a remote corner of her own creation, a solitary figure converting the victim of her latest exploit into the energy she will need to destroy more like him the next day.  It may be just a matter of hours until \\"Morning in America,\\" but Carle leaves us wondering if the self-sufficient spider really has much more to look forward to than the barnyard drones she so disdains.ate.

B000AP04L0|5.0|This is the funniest and most accurate office movie ever.  I've watched it 10 times and still laugh hysterically.
B0043URV8M|2.0|Perhaps I should start placing blame with David Yates for the continued downward trend with regards to the music of Harry Potter.  Since his installment as director, the music has been severely lacking in almost every way imaginable.  Although many disagree, John Williams did a wonderful job at the outset of the series to create an unmistakable identity that has finally been utterly, entirely and unapologetically abandoned.  Patrick Doyle's work for the fourth was incredibly romantic, emotionally arresting and despite mostly disregarding prior themes, distinctive.  Since his work, the series has been progressively less interesting.    I initially lambasted Hooper's score for not fitting within the context of the Harry Potter universe.  Hooper's work lacked the depth and texture (attributable to the orchestration and ensemble, which was simply too miniscule for such an endeavor) necessary to capture the the essence of all that is Harry Potter.  Those criticisms remain true, but I have more recently come to the realization that while the music was fairly ill-fitting, it at least had a bit of character and originality.    Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 is not a bad score, but it is nothing if not entirely anonymous.  \\"Obliviate\\" is probably the most memorable track on the album presentation, and when one considers that relative to \\"Hedwig's Theme,\\" \\"The Chamber of Secrets,\\" \\"Buckbeak's Flight,\\" or \\"Golden Egg,\\" that is not an accolade.  As with many modern film scores, this music could be injected into any action-drama film and work fairly well, so my principle criticism of the music is the antithesis of what I disliked about Hooper's score(s): it does fit the context of the story and visuals well enough, but it delivers no emotional impact and will be completely forgotten within minutes.  John Williams is not the only composer capable of creating memorable themes or entire scores with effective and pervasive leitmotif (Patrick Doyle's theme for the family in Goblet of Fire isarguably one of the best in the entire series).  Although I freely admit that Desplat is not a favorite of mine, his work for The Golden Compass and The Twilight Saga: New Moon far eclipse his effort for Deathly Hallows.    Again, this music is not technically poor, but within the context of the film and the broader realm of movie scores, it is a missed opportunity of epic proportions.  This movie is the culmination (well, half) of a fictional event very dear to the hearts of hundreds of millions of people across the globe and it deserves a better musical accompaniment, one that is distinguishable and faithful to the series (by which I mean more than a three-second, studio-demanded reference to \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" on celesta).    I would assume it is safe to say that Desplat will be completing the series with Deathly Hallows Pt. 2 and I do not hestitate to express my disappointment.  I shall obviously reserve final judgement until the movie and score are released next year, but I am not hopeful that Desplat will finish the series in as such a wonderful way as it began.

B001PB3RU8|5.0|Like the majority of people, I was drawn to Florence and the Machine thanks to \\"Dog Days are Over.\\" From that song, I pictured their whole album to be incredibly diverse not to mention original and it certainly did not disappoint. Granted, it did take me a few listens to really get into it, but when you get used to all the songs, you will realize how wonderful this album is. Florence's voice is a unique versatile one that can adapt to bluesy tunes and also works well with pop-style songs. Her voice along with the musical talents of \\"The Machine\\" are a wonderful combination that offers a different sound. It's a refresher that I think the music world has needed for far too long.

Photography is my hobby and I was looking for a book that would further my knowledge of black and white photography.  I chose the wrong book.  This book is 95% about development methods of black and white film (negatives) and prints.  It's been a few years, but I have developed my own black and white prints before, and I'm telling you that the content in these pages is easily 100 times more advanced than my past experience and skills.  These authors go into extreme detail on the entire process of (what I consider) old fashioned film photography.  I kept wondering how many people in the world would have the background and the desire to learn and understand the narrow-focus material in the book... 10?  Ok, fine... not everyone is like me, and there are probably quite a few more real professionals and/or hobbyists that will use this as a bible to enhance their already fanatical dedication to the art and craftsmanship involved in this subject.  Nevertheless, if you are like me then I would suggest looking for another book for digital black and white information, especially if you'll be printing anywhere other than in a darkroom (like on a -gasp- inkjet printer!)    Regarding the physical aspects of the book... it is bigger, heavier, and higher quality than most books you'll come across.  The thought crossed my mind a few times to cut out many of the beautiful pictures in the book and frame them!  Even though it's not for me, I do give it five stars for its quality, focus, thoroughness, and professional treatment of a craft that is likely in steep decline due to technological advances.
0307266303|5.0|I'm not much of a reader, but this book came recommended to me by a fellow runner after I have been plagued with running injuries. It's a fantastic book, an easy read, and incredibly motivating. You can't put the book down until you finish, but once you do, you just want to start running. This is a must-read for any runner but even couch potatoes will enjoy it.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|pretty good movie with a good story line.  i would highly recommend this for a family looking to watch something together
B004DK5CYM|5.0|Now this move was Pure DELIGHT, a movie made for old and young alike, I remember the races of Secretariat and what an Exciting horse she really was, This movie captured it all, and more, this is a MUST SEE MOVIE, and a MUST HAVE for your home library.<br />I guarantee that it will be the best [ ... ] you spent once you watched it, I was so surprised when it did not do so well @ the box office, I figured that it would have cleaned up and become one of the biggest for the year, strange how fickle people are, they would rather watch Blood Guts and Gore that a Feel GOOD movie, I just can NOT understand it. Don't be one of the NON watchers, order it and you will be so so HAPPY, I just ordered mine.<br /><br />Warmest Holiday Wishes to all And a Very Happy NEW YEAR may 2011 be a Much better year to all.<br /><br />Jan Harde.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I LOVE this disk.  I listen to it all the time.  The delivery was fast, and the disk was in mint condition.  I will be purchacing other products from this company in the future.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|What a beautiful TRUE story!   Actually a true story!  Life is so full of beauty that sometimes you wonder why we have fiction.      I won't  say anything about this movie except it is about  a dog named Hachi and a professor named Parker - their love for each other - the love of a man for a dog - the love of a dog for man - a love that lasts more than a lifetime.  You just have to see it.      Richard Gere, you were wonderful in this but all of the cast was wonderful.  The cast played it to the hilt.  Your wife Cate, played perfectly by Joan Allen, who needs to be seen more and more, was excellent in her part.  Your daughter, Sarah Reomer must be watched!  Wonderful facial expressions!   Her husband and finally their son, all stole the show, too.  Everyone in this movie was more than great!  Although  I am still angry with Jason Alexander for \\"coming-on\\" to Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman,  he redeemed himself in this movie!  At last!    Great acting.  Great expressions.  Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Ken was deep in his caring for both Parker and Hachi.   Great movie, glad I bought the rental from Amazon!  It's a keeper!    Thanks for this movie - it will be loved forever.  I love that dog!
B0043A0PXU|5.0|Oh my god, i have always loved Annie Lennox since The Tourists, Eurythmics and her solo albums...and now she done it again, this album has the best voice ever heard in a christmas album, and the best arrangements, Annie is fantastic, creative, emotional, she doesn´t sing with her voice, she sings with her soul and her heart. Listen to this album and you will know what christmas is about...\\"must be talking to an angel\\" and this angel is Annie Lennox, thank you Annie for giving me chills in my heart since the 1980´s I love you, I´m you number one fan forever!!
B003XKPPOU|1.0|THANKS Pixar!    My 6-year old now has recurring nightmares after watching this. Totally unsuitable for kids age 6 or less. Too brutal, too scary. She cried for 10 minutes during the scene where Woody and his party were supposed to go up in flames. Not to mention the creepy monkey in the monitoring room and the spooky baby doll on the swing during the late escape.     Part 1 and 2 used to be kind of nice. But this one is totally off the chart. NOT recommendable.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|SECRETARIAT is a great horse movie because of the way the horses who portray Secretariat interact with the cast members.  In other horse movies, like SEABISCUIT, the horses are just there.  In SECRETARIAT there was an obvious connection between the humans and equines.  (We have four horses and I know how that interaction works.)  The horse racing scenes are well done, too.  Equally important is Lane's portrayal of Secretariat's owner, who was instrumental in making Secretariat's career possible.  That horse was the most charismatic race horse there ever was, and on days when he was feeling well, no other horse could touch him.  One could build a case that he had an excuse for every race he lost.  His Kentucky Derby and especially his Belmont Stakes make him immortal in the annals of racing.    I like the idea of owning both a blu-ray copy and regular dvd.  The blu-ray is for our large TV and the dvd is for lending to friends who don't have blu-ray.
1401310400|1.0|I haven't read the book yet - ordered a couple for stocking stuffers - so I'm not commenting on the writing. The book itself is the poorest quality paperback I have ever seen. It's physically smaller than a standard paperback. The font is tiny and the center margins are so extended that you have to break the binding to read it.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I bought this blueray for my birthday. I give it 5 stars because I got it with free shipping and it came with a dvd and a third video with extra scenes, it was a total surprise to me. I can't wait to see it. I'm very happy with it I got 3 videos for the price of 1 and the seller was very prompt! Thanks.
1857885082|5.0|To the English expats out there married to Americans and living here, have you wondered why you find your in-laws so rude, so personal and so invasive with their questions? Do you dread new social situations knowing that the inevitable \\"What do you do?\\" is only a moment's eye contact away? Why do you feel so startled when you get seemingly argumentative responses to small talk comments about the weather? Why do you breathe that huge sigh of relief when the plane touches down at Heathrow every summer? If you feel any of these things, you must read this book.  I did and after 27 years, I finally get it. I'm not eccentric or strange, I am English.  Make sure everyone in your family reads this book.  They will have a brand new appreciation of you!
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|I love this macro lens, at this price I wasn't sure quite what to expect. But this is impressive - very fun lens to play around with, and the beauty of it is it is extremely easy to take on/off ...    I own a design business, and periodically need to take photos of small products like springs, screws, bolts, etc...and this lens worked perfect - exactly what I was looking for!    Highly recommend if you are budding photographer...
B0030IIYYS|5.0|As always, Amazon offers excellence in product (Toy Story DVD), pricing, shipping & handling, and customer service.  It sure is nice to have a place where you can purchase items without any hassle.  You and the kids will enjoy this DVD many times over.
B000P2A256|5.0|For those who love Maroon 5 and the sounds they have produced before, this album stays true to Maroon 5 style.
B000000OMB|3.0|One of the more oddball shotgun marriages in musical history was Asia, a \\"supergroup\\" comprised of one ELP member (drummer Carl Palmer), one Crimson King (vocalist/bass John Wetton), a YesMan (guitarist Steve Howe) and a Buggle (keyboardist Geoff Downes). With that kind of pedigree, you would expect long, self-indulgent soloing and piles of classically inspired virtuosity. Surprisingly, none of that appeared on their Geffen debut in 1982.<br /><br />Instead, you got straight ahead arena rock with strong melodies and eager to please hooks on about half of the album. Yes, the album was stunningly well produced and played with verve, but these men were most certainly no pop=musicians. Downes might have been, considering the meager output of The Buggles, however it seems the man who wrote \\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\" really longed to write \\"Starship Trooper.\\" He and Wetton co-wrote the bulk of the songs here, and while there's plenty of soloing going on, it's economical. (Which was the alleged reason Howe left after two albums, he wanted more.)<br /><br />Again, though, these men are not pop writers. Which means that half the songs on \\"Asia\\" are utterly awful, long forgotten in the ongiong classic rock play for \\"Heat Of The Moment,\\" \\"Only Time Will Tell\\" and \\"Wildest Dreams.\\" Palmer gets to wail away on the drums during \\"Wildest Dreams,\\" while it is Downes' keyboards that make the album sound like the band didn't just drop in from the seventies. That didn't stop \\"Asia\\" from hitting number one and getting a lot of pretentious \\"serious music\\" snobs from creaming themselves over what they considered a rabbit punch to new wave. (Or critics from mocking the band for sounding like throwbacks IN the peak of new wave.)<br /><br />Either way, Asia had the last laugh. Some 40 years later, the good stuff on the disc sounds cool, but that means you're probably just as well off with [[ASIN:B0009NZ3XW Asia Gold]] - which at least has a more up-to-date track mastering - than just buying this one.ing this one.
0553573403|5.0|I loved this book and the series itself but wish the author would keep writing.  Recommend waiting until series is finished before starting.
B0014U4X3U|5.0|The Kindle Edition of The complete Works of Jane Austin was a great bargain price!  I love to read classics and was pleased.  The illustrations were small, but showed up nicely and I had absolutely no issues with the format.
B00433QE3M|5.0|What the hell's the MATTER with you other reviewers? Only a handful of 5 star reviews? I'd give this 6 if I could.     I'm 52 years old, and been with Carlos since Abraxas. I'm a professional keyboard player, and life long Santana fan. This absolutely smokes. It's wonderful, and it's near perfect. \\"It's not Santana\\" one reviewer said. Say WHAT? Exactly! He didn't write these songs, and he adapted himself. This is Carlos paying tribute, and it smokes. I cannot wait to see this tour, because I can tell right now it has the potential to go down as perhaps the single best live concert experience of my life. Viva La Santana. If you're reading this Carols, hey, it worked for me!
0385736002|3.0|I must have misunderstood the listing, because the book arrived with a very creased cover.. it has been well used, not in great condition.  But shipping was very fast.  I am mostly happy with my purchase.
0316044695|3.0|The men this story focuses on are heroes in every sense of the word. Marcus Luttrell is also a hero and an amazing American. However, if you're looking at buying his book, be prepared for what you're going to read. The book is written like a stereotypical Texan might be expected to speak--so colloquialisms abound, to the point of ridiculousness. The reader can't make it more than two or three pages without some rant about the liberal media being thrown in. Luttrell has an excellent point to make about how we set up our forces for failure with ROE--I've heard it from many people who have been there, done that. And no one understands how we compromise our own troops better than he does. But by framing it in little snippy asides and complaints about the \\"liberal media,\\" he doesn't do a very good job of explaining intelligently what needs to change about our ROE. If you love Texas, Jesus, and Fox News, this stuff will only serve to increase your enjoyment of the book. Otherwise, you'll find yourself fighting through those parts to get to the good parts, which are about humble, bold men giving all for their country and each other.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Just don't make the same mistake I did.. I bought this disc bcs of the music only, and all videos are a very important part of this project.   I realized that videos can provide you full entertainment, and could even organize or invite some people, have a couple of be... and listen to this..    I am buying one with as many videos as possible now..
B004CAWKXE|5.0|So like many of you, I was skeptical when MCR said they were going for a more rock and roll tone to their music. I loved the Black Parade so I was a tad disappointed when moved away from the sound I loved, so automatically I had this on my disappointment list. Boy was I wrong, this is without a doubt THE best MCR album, and quite possibly the best rock album in 5 years. The standout of the album to me is \\"Save Yourself, I'll Hold Them Back,\\" very good lyrics and chorus, and an awesome guitar, but don't count out the other tunes, this album is absolutely loaded with quality content. I enjoyed the whole album from start to finish, all the songs I liked which is very hard to find these days, there are no fillers here. If you are a fan of rock, alternative, or any other music involving a guitar....this is for you.
B002ZG98ZA|1.0|Bought it as a gift for Christmas.  Looks fine.  Have not taken it out of package.  Hopefully it will be fine.  will update after Christmas.  Got here fast.  Update: Watched it with wife.  Worst movie ever.  Awful.  Do not buy!  Kill it with fire!
044661758X|5.0|Michael Connelly really roped me in on this one.  Just about I had the story figured out and knew \\"whodunit\\" he threw another wrench in the fire.  Kept me totally engrossed from the very first to the last word on the last page.  Truly a page turner!  Treat yourself to the package Amazon has right now with \\"The Concrete Blonde\\" and the \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\".  They are 2 of the best books I have read this year and I read a lot!
0446691437|5.0|This book is for everyone who has given up on a dream.  It will inspire you to dream again.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|This is a great show and for all ages.  It has comedy, drama, music all in one.  Music is life and having a show like this is a great inspiration for everyone.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|the best. Loved seeing how they did all that stuff. The movie makes me cry everytime I watch it. reminds me of the American Indians & the Aztec's, but this time the bullies come in and get their butts kicked from the the natives. Did you hear that bullies, you can't just take what you want. Very good movie.
B003UHYSDK|3.0|If you like what I called it, you'll like the music.  I just can't listen to it, as I thought for some odd reason that it was catergorized as metal.  Middle of the road -not metal, sounds like the 70s music that has good base lines.  Can't say that there's a whole lot of demand for that, these days.  Unless you came to the same revelation which I have... the new rock is nothing like Pearl Jam, Aerosmith, or actually anything happening during the nineties or earlier.  Half of which, you could actually listen to and enjoy.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book was excellent. It really kept you interested, it makes me wish the next book was already out.  I've read my share of literature both classic and modern.  In the modern catigory this one definately is a top contender.  It is an easy read because it is targeted for a younger audience but still, excellent.  I have to admit though I should have seen the ending coming -- it's so easy to forget details in that book that it isn't even funny.  I really enjoy the humor that is mixed into the book as well. I would rate it right along side his first series.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|Any publicity is good publicity, and Kanye has publicity out the...publicity?  The man is a genius.  Controversial?  Yes.  Influential?  For sure.  Egotistical?  Check.  Voice of a generation?  Like it or not, probably yes, but I know good music when I hear it, and this album is beyond good.  This is the Chronic 2010. (Dre: rap what Kanye raps and call it Detox.)  If this was the only album that I listened to all year, I would still be able to tell you - without listening to anything else - that this album is hands down the album of the year.  Thank Me Later?  Really good.  Lady Killer?  Really good.  Curren$y?  He's awesome.  Guilty Simpson, Beach House, LCD Soundsystem?  Some of the best albums of 2010 (the indie rockers killed it again this year), but this is better.  I know this decade just started, but this is probably the album of the decade.    This album is epic.  Including two minute-long interludes, the average track length is over 5 minutes.  One track is 9 minutes.  The last 9 minute rap song I heard was 300 Bars n Runnin.  Every track flows well into the next.  Even the last track flows well into the first track.    Yea, there are a lot of F-bombs, but the last person that tried to make a rap record without them was Will Smith and he got jiggy with it pretty far out of the spotlight.  And yea, there's some \\"noise\\" and some reverb, some lo-fi and some auto tune, but the man makes it work - on a rap album nonetheless.  The guest list is stellar - the RZA, Jay-Z (twice), Pusha T, John Legend, Justin Vernon, Chris Rock, and that's only half the list!  The lyrics are nothing short of amazing.  Forceful, true, and filled with fury...and Fantasy.  Read them on some website if you don't believe the hype.    You'll want this one.
B001TOD92C|5.0|This has become one of my new \\"favorites\\".... I've fallen in love with Mickey Roark's performance, and character! Thanx Amazon for offering this movie @ such an affordable price! It's one I've always wanted to own....
B003DTLUFO|5.0|The figure came a lot earlier than I would have thought! Everything was intact and as it should be. The figure is AMAZING and comes with TONS of accessories. Very posable and is very well made. I only have two complaints. The hair joints come off too easily, which is surprising, considering how secure the rest of the joints on the figure are. THe other complaint is that the hair for the Chibi-face for this figure does not line up with the back base hair model and looks a little awkward up close. However, despite these things it is a beautiful, amazing looking figure. Tons of detail and very durable.
0399536108|5.0|This book has been a life-changer. The concept of world domination as the nexus between the two most important questions in the world is revolutionary: what can you, uniquely give to the world? and what do you want from the world? From there, just go do it!     Chris's is my favorite of the life design theories, because he reminds us about legacy and leaving a contribution to the world. His online manifesto caught my attention and this book sky-rocketed my support for his message.     Check him out online, read the book, and try to make it to one of his unconventional book tour stops. Because really, who wants to be unremarkable?
B003EYVXXW|4.0|I particularly enjoy historical/period pieces movies so wanted to see Agora, even tho some reviews were not good.  I liked the movie  (DVD) and thought the costumes and sets were great.  I learned more about a real-life person and a period of history in Alexandria.  While a bit campy at time, if you enjoy history movies,  you will like this.
B00402FGEE|5.0|blah blah blah....<br /><br />I'm a LONG time Stargate fan, love all the previous material, SG 1, Atlantis, the movie.... blah blah blah...<br /><br />I took one look at Universe, and thought I'd hate it... but the truth is, I love it. The characters are well written, the tension is supreme, and the clouded motivations<br />make for wonderful onscreen chemistry between characters who are ALL flawed.... No Daniel Jacksons on this show!!<br /><br />Anyway, this show caters to newbs as well as seasoned Gaters. The last episode arc of season 1 features our friends the Lucian Alliance, and I won't spoil it, but it<br />is FUN FUN FUN!!!<br /><br />I love this show and hope it runs longer than Atlantis did.... ATLANTIS died long before it's time, and I HATE that...<br /><br />5 stars, my highest recommendation.<br /><br />PS, the actors are wonderful, I cannot speak highly enough of the performances. The guy who plays Colonel Young is FANTASTIC!!
B003YWUTKM|4.0|I purchased this CD because of David Gilmour's contribution. I was pleased to the point of wanting to hear more of Mr. Gilmour &, therefore, the \\"4 stars.\\" Otherwise, it is a pristine recording but not so much that it leaves you with a feeling of sterility. Final analysis: it has piqued my interest to the point where I might just check out more of THE ORB's recordings.
1416550550|5.0|Loved it.  While reading I thought \\"Next time I read this . . . \\" I enjoyed it that much.  Plenty of history, mystery and a touch of romance.
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|This PRODUCT, as in the DVD itself, works so I feel pretty good about throwing in a star for a movie that should be rated negative 5 stars.<br /><br />Before I even get into my real complaints about this film, I just have to say that if seeing Liza Minnelli singing and dancing to that ridiculous song \\"All the Single Ladies\\" doesn't make you puke and rethink your purpose in life, then I applaud your strength or question your judgment (I certainly question mine for continuing to watch the movie after that terrible moment).<br /><br />This movie was so, so bad.  Of course, I have a brain (and I choose to use it), a real job, real relationships, and J.Crew is as about as fancy as I get clothing-wise (although I very much appreciate fashion - just can't afford it).  Oh, and I have NOT had a lobotomy, which is clearly a prerequisite to enjoying this train wreck of a film.  I also do not believe in making my gay friends cute accessories to my life - they are real people with real relationships.  That \\"wedding\\" at the beginning was outright offensive, as was this portrayal of women throughout the entire film.<br /><br />Everyone involved in the creation of this horrific display of pink-laden idiotic female stereotypes set in the most preposterous circumstances imaginable should be shot.<br /><br />However, if you like shiny things and have surrendered your autonomy to a man, you will probably enjoy this movie.
B0046BAATK|5.0|I purchased Illuminations and was somewhat skeptical because Josh changed  producers.  But after listening, I love this CD!  I do not understand the critics stating that this CD is not inspirational.  While listening to War at Home, I actually sobbed.  This song is a good reminder of what our troops go through when they return home.  How can anything be more real?  I also am very inspired by his other songs.  Hidden Away has such simple and raw lyrics.  If we all would live by the lyrics written in this song, this world would be a much better place.  Also, love The Bells of New York City and Higher Window.  Josh is a once in a lifetime talent and I'm very thankful that he shares his heart and soul with us through his music.    Thanks Josh for another great CD.  I hope that you will be touring near Atlanta because I will aim to be on the sitting on front row watching.
B003E20ZQA|4.0|I really enjoyed this ebook and was discussing it with a friend who had a hardcopy version and she commented on how wonderful the photos were. Really? Well the ebook (kindle version) did NOT come with any photos. As one of the more expensive ebooks too I think its very disappointing that they are not included. I feel like I haven't really seen the whole book now. I have other ebooks that did have photos eg Life by Keith Richards. I hope you will include photos in future. If they are are in the hard coopies then they ought to be in the electronic version.
0847835073|5.0|The rate of photos I like is quite high, some are simply excellent! There are many photos in the book but actually I'd like to see more to make my own selection...    Everybody who admires Monica Bellucci will be very pleased with this book. Beautiful face, beautiful body, attractive personality -- the woman with the soul of woman :)
0811876373|5.0|This book is exactly as promoted.  The delivery time to Australia was wonderful.  My first Amazon experience and a very positive one.  Thank you

B002ZG980U|1.0|This movie to me signals the end of cinema as we know it.     A movie with such a ridiculous concept, that most of the beef of the movie is spent explaining it, by one-dimensional characters in a dream.    The part that killed the movie for me, and where I ended up walking out, was between scenes of clunky exposition by one-dimensional characters in a dream, two one-dimensional characters float around in zero gravity. Was that supposed to be a joke?    What was funny, was as watching it, I couldn't wait to see a parody, making fun of Nolan's convoluted and heartless mess. I figured it would be a Saturday Night Live skit, with all the characters taking turns explaining arbitrary concepts, with other scenes filled with mindless, over the top gunfights.    Funny enough, South Park beat SNL to the punch. South Park made an entire episode making fun of Inception. My favorite quote was, \\"Just because something is overly complicated doesn't make it cool!\\" After that, another mindless gunfight starts.    Great stuff. I highly recommend you skip \\"Inception\\" and seek out the South Park episode instead. Much better written and funnier.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|In disney's pixar's toy story 2, you see the origin of woody. this movie is awesome. you favorite characters are back and better than ever. this movie rocks. and meet some new lovaable characters. this movie rules
B000W4D94I|5.0|When this movie came out as one of the earlier Dolby 5.1 DVD titles in 1990s, it was the showcase movie - or the benchmark - for which 5.1 is utilized. You can actually feel you are in the middle of the tornado the way the sound was decoded and played throughout the 5 speakers.    This blu-ray's surround sound still hold that gold standard in my opinion. It really utilize the two rear speakers well for 1) for objects flying from front to back and vice versa, and 2) within vicinity of the tornado when debris hit on your behind as well as the wind noises. The best part is you can hear transition of a debris flying from one speaker to the next, which gives the inside-the-tornado effect. This is something I find still difficult to realize with other modern titles, especially action films. They might have lots of explosions and clearer sounds, but never got that extensive directional feel.    As for the picture, it's still clear but obviously softer then the recent movies. But still can see edges of the hail (larger ice balls), and slanted rains. Most of the skin details of the actors can be seen pretty well also.    For the price of this blu-ray (around $10), it's a great get to add to collection. I would still use this movie to show case surround sound more than any other recent action movies.

B000RF1QDS|1.0|I know that the movie would have been good.  But it was impossible to view this movie.  Whatever version HD DVD is it won't play either on my brand new Panasonic Blu Ray player or my DVD player.
0060775858|5.0|My children and, now, my granddaughter, and I love this book.  The illustrations and prose are beautiful.  And as one reviewer said, there is a meditative quality to the book that makes it a wonderful good night book.    And we all have loved to find the little mouse on each of the pages (well, not the black and white ones.)  \\"Where is the little mouse?\\" I say.  And our child hunts in all the places and, happily finds it. A lovely shared reading.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|A lot of Springsteen fans keep hoping for another \\"Born to Run\\" (my favorite album of all time), but I'm thankful that Springsteen has moved on and is created music with new sounds relevant for today.  \\"Magic\\" contains some fun songs (\\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\\") mixed in with lyrics touching on political life in America in the early 2000's.  If you go into the album with an open mind, you'll find several gems here.  In addition to \\"Girls. . . ,\\" I especially like \\"You'll Be Coming Down,\\" \\"Your Own Worst Enemy,\\" \\"I'll Work For Your Love,\\" and \\"Long Walk Home.\\"  Songs like \\"Long Walk Home\\" have several meanings in the context of the times, while still being timeless.  I purchased the CD, but here it looks like the MP3 version of the album has the excellent hidden track \\"Terry's Song\\" in the same MP3 as \\"Devil's Arcade\\" at the end.  I don't like it when they mix a hidden track into another song and would prefer it as a separate MP3 (the CD I purchased had it as a separate song), but of course that is not a reason to avoid this outstanding album.

B001LMU182|4.0|Althought my item arrived before the expected time, the package content is kinda different to the photos. There is ONLY the Blu-Ray box as you can see in the image 1 of the announcement. There is no box included. The black one. I'm a little disappointed about this, but I do recommend to everybody buy this BluRay.  Akira is the movie that motivated me to start to watch animes, so it's a perfect reference of all best ingredients for a marvelous anime.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|This show is fun, quirky, funny take on all varieties of students at community college and how they are able to bond as a group of friends, despite their differences. Chevy Chase's character, Pierce, quickly grows tiresome (which is intentional, but still not pleasant), but the remaining cast is brilliantly hilarious. Abed and Troy's antics never cease to amuse, and Jeff's continued pursuit of an easy degree, women, and (occasionally) a soul continue to entertain. A quick, fun romp with high repeat watch value! I can't recommend it enough!
0671027344|5.0|There is something about this book that really touches my heart. I relate to Charlie because I was a lot like him.  I was the teacher's pet in English and I was confused when it came to social situations.  So you could say that me and Charlie are kindred spirits.<br /><br />I picked up this book, not knowing what I would find.  i found a wonderful, sweet, heart warming story about a kid. You love Charlie and you want him to succeed.  You'll cry when Charlie is hurt, you're gasp when Charlie does something scary, you'll laugh when Charlie is just Charlie.<br /><br />If you are an avid reader like me, then you must add this book to your collection.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|1 Blu-ray Disc/1 DVD Disc, released November 2, 2010<br /><br />Oh, \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\\" I remember being babysat by my Nanu (my name for my grandmother) with my sisters and being plopped in front of the TV to watch this movie on several occasions. At the time, I thought it was the best movie EVER. Watching it now is still nostalgic, but I can't help but notice how....long it is. It's like two and a half hours long! Still the music, the dancing, the colors, and the imagination are all a pleasure.<br /><br />Dick Van Dyke stars as Caractacus Potts who is a bit of a crack pot. He home schools his two children and lives the life of a dreamer and is a great inventor. After a failed turn with \\"toot sweets\\" (candies that double as whistles), he manages to invent the most amazing car ever that can fly and float where needed. Sally Ann Howes plays Truly Scrumptious who ends up falling in love with Potts and his family as they take a ride into a magical world of castles, pirates, and musical adventure. Lionel Jeffries plays Caractacus's even more eccentric father (In real life, Jeffries was four years younger than Dick Van Dyke, but was prematurely bald and looked the part.) who is kidnapped and mistaken for the great inventor who could possibly make a new Chitty Chitty Bang Bang for the bad guys.<br /><br />While at the beach, storytelling begins and imaginations get the best of everyone as they are all sucked into the story. There are tons of hits from the dancing in \\"The Old Bamboo\\" to \\"Toot Sweets\\" to the children singing to \\"Truly Scrumptious\\" and father and children singing to each other in \\"I Have You Two.\\" Then there's the classic \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\" which begins with the car itself making the noises and turning it into a tribute to the vehicle.<br /><br />It's a huge production, very colorful and a classic for children. Dick Van Dyke talks about in the extras how this type of innocence has been lost in today's children's movies, but how children need it. I can easily imagine kids today being impatient with it, but it is still magical and I hope future kids can still dream of \\"Hushabye Mountain.\\"<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />There's a sing-along on both the DVD and the Blu-ray so you can sing-along as the movie plays. In \\"Remembering Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\" with Dick Van Dyke, he talks about the experience and the difficulty of learning the dance numbers and how after he didn't warm up before one performance, he ended up tearing the muscle at the back of his leg and was off dancing for six weeks. He loved working with Sally Ann Howes who was graceful, beautiful, and had a gorgeous voice. He reveals the man who played his father was younger than him and how they changed the story of the pirates from actually happening to becoming a fantasy so they could go as far as they wanted. He talks about working with Benny Hill, the king who was from \\"Goldfinger\\", and how the graceful dancing of the child-catcher helped him avoid injury with his entire cart tipped over end over end. Dick Van Dyke's life dream was to be the Scarecrow from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" so the part was written for him to be the puppet life-size toy so he could explore his love for pantomime and talks about the whole number as one of the best numbers the Sherman brothers ever did.<br /><br />Pierre Picton owns the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang motor car number 11 and leads the featurette, \\"A Fantasmagorical Motorcar\\". His car was used during the film to fall to pieces and while he was there, they asked him to be caretaker to the other Chitty Chittys during production. He ended up buying two more and has taken them around the world for others to see. He takes you through the parts on the car and the cleaning process so she can really gleam. The body has some real shiny wood, brass, and the red leather seats make it VERY classy and turn heads. He points out all the levers for refreshments, the letter box, the dials that show how high you are flying, and hepulls out the wings for full effect.<br /><br />In using the \\"Music Machine\\" featurette, you can just skip ahead to your favorite musical numbers. \\"Toot Sweets Toots Musical Maestro\\" is a feature you can turn on during the movie where six times throughout the film, a candy contraption will appear with a bunch of candies on it that will move to the music. You have to remember the order and then use the red, blue, yellow, and green buttons on your Blu-ray remote to enter the same pattern as fast as you can. Huh. I never knew those buttons had a purpose till now, obviously I should have known they were for candy memory games.<br /><br />The Sherman Brothers' demos are included with some simple voices accompanied by piano to paint the picture of what they wished to achieve in planning the film. There are also galleries of photos and vintage advertising and vintage featurettes. The vintage featurettes are old indeed showing another tinkerer who likes to take items around the house and make them into something new.<br /><br />There is also a cute High-definition game you can play with the arrows on your remote where you carefully \\"drive\\" Chitty Chitty Bang Bang through a series of obstacles first on the road and then in the sky! It's pretty easy, but looks really cool.sic Machine\\" featurette, you can just skip ahead to your favorite musical numbers. \\"Toot Sweets Toots Musical Maestro\\" is a feature you can turn on during the movie where six times throughout the film, a candy contraption will appear with a bunch of candies on it that will move to the music.

B00004RERW|4.0|The DSD version is multichannel.  Very nice mix excellent sound.  Hard to find & expensive but still worth considering if you're a big fan Celine Dion and these songs really work for you so get it while you can.  I bought it because I'm a surround freak not a Dion fan.  She has a excellent voice but her songs are a bit too much of the big corp music machine style for my taste why I gave it 4 stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is the first book of a trilogy by Suzanne Collins. This Kindle e-book edition is 384 pages in length.<br /><br />*SPOILER*<br /><br />A draconian regime has come to rule what was once the USA; now a land now called Panem. The main area called the 'Capital' holds sway with an iron fist over 12 other lesser 'districts'. Once a year, in an attempt to provide 'amusement' for their own populous AND to bluntly remind the other districts just who is boss, they put on an event called, 'The Hunger Games'. Each one the other 12 districts MUST pick, by lottery, one boy and one girl between the ages of 11 and 18 to participate in this event. The 24 contestants (called 'tributes') are put into a huge open outdoor wilderness where they must their strength, cunning and whatever else they my find in this 'arena' to try to become the sole survivor of these 'games'. The winner, along with the inhabitants of his/her district, get to eat and live in relative splendor for the next year.<br /><br />This is the tale of two district 12 candidates...following a girl named Katniss and, to a lesser extent, a boy named Peeta. Katniss shows us numerous traits of her maturation process as she struggles throughout 'the games';  twinges of guilt, a faltering self-esteem, loyalty issues, nagging doubts about her sense of morality,  her untested survival abilities and most important...would she or could she, when the moment came, be able to kill another human being.  During the course of the tale, some of these traits are strengthened, some diminished...some for the better and some not. Needless to say, Katniss is a very interesting heroine.<br /><br />*END SPOILER*<br /><br />Although this work can easily be classified as young adult (YA), there are many elements within these pages to satisfy most adult readers. Collins has done a remarkable job in preventing this work from becoming a series of miraculous escapes and unbelievable occurrences...things that so often plague the YA genre of books.  I thought, on several occasions, that I'd figured out what would seem the most likely outcome of some decision made by Katniss or  Peeta, and not only was I wrong most of the time, but the way things actually went or turned out, was nearly always  better, than I'd foreseen.<br /><br />Also, after I'd read enough to get a gist of what was happening, I found the plot turned out to be much more complex than what I'd expected. I was very impressed with the skill with which Collins described and manipulated the 'situations' that Katniss and Peeta found themselves facing during the 'games'. Nothing seems to help develop (or crush) the sense of growing up like having to make important decisions...and several of the decisions that our two heroes had to make could only be described as agonizing.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />An exciting page turner...well written, superbly paced and a plot exceeding well thought out and executed. Written using 2 teenagers as the main protagonists, giving it a YA feel, but the overall quality shines through and will satisfy most adult readers.  I look forward to book II.<br />5 Stars<br /><br />Ray Nicholson<br /><br />PS<br />Thanks to amazon friend Paul Weiss for bringing this fine book to my attention.casions, that I'd figured out what would seem the most likely outcome of some decision made by Katniss or  Peeta, and not only was I wrong most of the time, but the way things actually went or turned out, was nearly always  better, than I'd foreseen.

B001GCUO5W|3.0|So as far the the blu-ray itself goes its a nice product! The video and audio are done very well. Some of the special features were nice, but none were anything I'd watch over again. As far as the movie itself... I give it a big thumbs down. The way the movie started I literally new in the first 5 minutes exactly how this was going to end. My girlfriend did not believe me, so I wrote it down on a piece of paper. At the end of the movie she opened it up and guess who was right!? Me! If you've never seen a \\"twist ending\\" movie before then maybe you should watch this cause it \\"might shock you.\\" If you are a movie person I think you will be very disappointed by this. It was EXTREMELY predictable scene after scene after scene and reminded me of SOOOO many other movies. This gets 3 stars because the cinematography was beautiful and the acting was done very well! All in all however unless you have a crush on Leo, I'd rent this movie on blu or dvd (cause the visuals weren't THAT astounding) but I'd avoid the purchase. If you wanna buy a Leo movie I've gotta suggest What's Eating Gilbert Grape; Blood Diamond; The Deprated; or even Inception.

B00493AD74|1.0|If you need a sleeping aid, don't take Tylenol PM, watch this instead.  Eat, Pray, Love is the second worst movie I have ever seen.  It is more interesting to watch your Uncle Rico eat, your Aunt Sarah pray, and even a nonexistent love life would be more interesting cinema than the nearly platonic love relationship of this movie.  This movie has beautiful scenery as it is filmed in multiple countries, but a Google image search or travel magazines would produce the same effect.  Furthermore, I though gurus were supposed to be wise and interesting.  Highly disappointing.
B003EV6DBM|3.0|Steven Moffatt, Doctor Who's new head writer, has won multiple awards writing for this show and worked with Spielberg, so he must be awesome, right?  Well, maybe not, as this season shows.  I enjoyed this season once through on BBC America, but when I watched the DVD, everything felt thin.  While I can't say this season is bad, it doesn't achieve the standards I've come to expect from Doctor Who.    On one hand, Matt Smith's Doctor isn't bad; he looks like an old, old man wearing a young man's body.  Karen Gillan as Amy makes a brash, outspoken foil to the Doctor, keeping him upright and challenging him to greater humanity.  Arthur Darvill's Rory, sadly underutilized, is pretty sharp, too.  And some of this year's villains, like Homo Reptilia or the Dream Lord, recapture the classic series' mystique and glory.    On the other hand, Smith waves the sonic screwdriver around so reflexively that it's like he has Tourette's.  Several episodes begin abruptly, with a problem or plot device that leaves writers' fingerprints on the stories, and end with long, talky denouements.  Moffatt's ambitious attempt to graft the season into one long arc, much like [[ASIN:B001K2KM9Q The Key to Time]], often seems strained, struggling to hang together against heavy-handed writing.    Many episodes, especially the climactic season-ender, only make sense if you make more leaps of faith than religion.  And I don't use that analogy lightly.  This season makes so many references to churches, bishops, and God that it starts to resemble evangelism.  I don't know if Moffatt and the writers' stable have a secret agenda, or just a pet issue, but whatever it is, they don't conceal it very well.    Don't misunderstand: this season isn't bad, nor do I fear it spells the end of Doctor Who.  I just had high hopes, and it doesn't withstand the scrutiny that comes with multiple viewings.  It has many good points, especially Smith himself, who reminds me of both Peter Davison and Paul McGann.  Perhaps things will improve.  After all, it took a year for Russell T. Davies to find his footing, too.
0060254920|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all times; I remember reading this book at my grandmother's house when I was little. The book is about a young book that get frustrated and gets sent to his room then his imagination takes over and sends him to a whole new world. Whenever I got upset or frustrated when I was younger this book would always come into my mind and help me settle down and realize that everything will be okay. This book is good to show children how to deal with frustration and that they will always have people around them that love them no matter what. The illustrations in this book are phenomenal, it starts off plain but then you really see the young boy's imagination take over. You see monsters and  a jungle like you have never seen before. This book is a must for young children!
B002ZG980U|4.0|Going into Inception was kind of a gamble for me as my friends and colleagues apparently know me better than I thought.  I've been hearing this is the \\"one to check out\\" since the day it arrived in theaters this past summer and while my friends have once again proven spot-on with their understanding of the kind of fiction I enjoy, it is always worrisome when so much hype comes my way.  I have to make a very conscious effort not to get swept up in it, as that is the sure-fire way to become disappointed with any project (however ambitious).<br /><br />That said I was able to suppress my tendency to become the ultimate Inception fan boy until its home-disc release then quickly snatched up the Blu-ray with reservations on picking up a Leo DeCaprio T-shirt and matching coffee mug.  To cut the chase, I enjoyed this film quite a bit but perhaps not quite to the levels my buddies assumed I would and the reason for this stems from the fact that some of its finest conceptual moments have been done before in various mediums.  However, we'll get to all that.  For now, let us get to the nuts and bolts of the picture.<br /><br />Inception tells the tale of Dom Cobb (Leonardo DeCaprio), an Extractor (a man who enters people's dreams to gather information).  With a team of dream-experts consisting of Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Ariadne (Ellen Page), Eames (Tom Hardy), and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), Cobb is hired by Saito (Ken Watanabe) to implant an idea (a unproven process called Inception) into the brain of Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy).<br /><br />If this sounds a bit muddled to you, then perhaps steering very clear of this picture will be your best bet.  For all of its intricate explanations, Inception is a venerable swirl of intense sequences that demands multiple viewings if any coherency is to be established.<br /><br />I liken the initial viewing experience to the first time I went though the original Matrix (another Warner Brothers piece with similar themes): The line between reality and the construct is quite hazy and the laws separating them aren't quite clearly understood despite plenty of exposition attempting to force-feed them to you.<br /><br />I suppose in the interest of the average viewer's sanity, Christopher Nolan was forced to integrate a technique that I personally am not too fond of here in that when the situation demands it, suddenly the rules established earlier on are said not to apply \\"in this situation\\", hence upping the level of danger to the characters involved.  Again though, given the complexity of the material here, it is far more forgivable than if used in a more-linear piece.<br /><br />And speaking of linearity, I will continue to summarize the plot without giving away any real spoilers.  Cobb could well be the ultimate mind thief except for one minor annoyance: The appearance of Mal (Marion Cotillard) who tends to turn up in Cobb's dreams and jobs, botching them out of spite.  Additionally we learn that Cobb is a proud daddy in the real world and that motivation to be reunited with his kids is the catalyst for his agreeing to such a risky assignment.<br /><br />In fact, so delicate is the act of incepting a persuasive motivation that it demands Cobb and company to enter into a dream within a dream within a dream! Each depth of the subconscious mind said to be far riskier, more unstable, and (what I found to be coolest of all) operating in its own relative speed.<br />The film is pretty stunning, visually, right from the onset with undeniable attention paid in the merging of gritty, moody dialog sequences with larger-than-life mind-bending effects.  Direction is spectacular here as well with camera moves and angles that dazzle continually.  Hans Zimmer's score is spot-on as well.  Truly from a technical standpoint, the piece is a stunner.<br /><br />The 2.5-hour runtime happens quickly and efficiently thanks to roller coaster pacing and a bit of disconnected editing work.<br /><br />In all, if having gotten this far in my review and aren't sure exactly how I feel about the piece, that's a pretty accurate observation.  Parts of this one are brilliant but unlike 1998's The Matrix or the 2005 novel Human Interface (both of which present some very similar mind-bending concepts), portions of Inception (especially the twist at the end) leave a flavor of forced existentialism.  There is potential for greatness here in every single moment of the picture but appreciation for it all takes time to settle in much in the same way one doesn't guzzle a bottle of fine wine.<br /><br />I suppose in conclusion the goal of science fiction cinema is to entertain and there is little doubt that Inception delivers in this regard.  It is certainly thought provoking, unique and technically impeccable.  I will conclude this review with a quote from the film that best describes the experience as a whole:  \\"Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize how things are actually strange.\\"e, that's a pretty accurate observation.

B0037KMHRY|5.0|Greetings Programs!<br /><br />For a long-awaited sequel to the 1982 classic Tron....Daft Punk couldn't have been a better choice to score it... they are fans of the original and their Euro-Techno sound lends itself perfectly to electronic nature of the TRON Universe! There are a couple of track which are more standard Daft Punk sounding and likely to get so mainstream radio play (I'd already heard one on BBC Radio One on Sirius/Xm Sat. Radio)...specifically \\"DEREZZED (track13)\\" pumping Techno beats on that one.<br /><br />Plenty of this you may find reminiscent of tracks on \\"Hearts in Space\\" with more energy... I mean that kindly, BTW. Many have a John Carpenter feel (in The Thing or  The Fog, maybe)... I also found myself comparing them to another 80-90's Composer Vangelis' work on Blade Runner or his Direct album.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the lack of any call-back to the original score, or at least Tron's theme... by Wendy Carlos and the late conductor Richard Bowden. Maybe this will be slipped into the movie itself... I will be watching,ur...listening, that is.<br /><br />This CD itself contain 22 great tracks by Daft Punk and addition online content if you use it with an online connection.

It still carries his trademark strangeness and distinct sense of storytelling, but it has a more palpable plot and storyline.  Brilliant and thought-provoking imagery is abundant, and is in no way compromised by the somewhat \\"modernized\\" story told by Jodorowsky. In a way, I would say it is also a good time-piece from the 80s.      \\"Adios, mujer...\\"
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I'm loving this lavish box set! After the negative reviews that have been posted lately I'm giving an A+ positive one here. If you're a true Beatles fan than this lavish box set containing ALL 10 classic Beatles that originally had appeared in MONO + a special MONO masters 2-CD complilation which has the mono singles that did'nt appear on the offical albums. Yellow Submarine, Abbey Road and Let It Be are MIA here beacuse they did not have official mono mixes. Two albums have unique 1965 stereo mixes that appear on CD for the 1st time, they are Help! and Rubber Soul. I being a huge fab four fan all these years can't believe I've missed out on these great mono mixes all these years, now I'm liking these just as much as the stereo mixes! I love the fact that the price for this is so much cheaper now, over half of what it was back in 2009 when it was released, I'm so glad I was finally able to afford it. This set is an absolute must for the true Beatles fan!
B00005OAE6|5.0|Very good CD, I have this on an album, cassette and CD now.  The only complaint is the song Ain't Got No Money is a total Rip Off of his song The Fire Down Below.  I guess it is OK since both songs are his.
1439107955|5.0|I'm halfway through, and cannot put it down. What fascinates me most is his dark, never overstated undertext: he's writing a history of experimentation on sick humans,<br />undertaken without informing many of them of the risks, benefits, & unknowns.  Seen another way, it's a history of medical hubris, mutilation and poisoning in the name of \\"saving\\" (usually prolonging by a few months) lives and advancing science. Mukherjee expresses empathy for suffering patients -- and the reader supplies his own feelings and questions - but some of the most driven scientists Mukherjee follows seem to lose sight of the human being whose body became a battleground in the war between cancer and the doctor.  But then, I'm not through yet, and I don't know if he addresses the alternative of simply accepting fate, making the last months as good as possible, and facing death. I liked finding out which cancers now have good treatment track records, and which ones remain so widely incurable that for the majority of sufferers, referral to hospice or palliative care may be more realistic and humane than aggressive treatment. (And in some cases, it even produces longer survival times.)<br />I'm happily chewing my way through. He''s a great writer and knows how to maintain drama and suspense, weaving together an enormous cast of characters without getting me lost. Never polemical. A masterwork.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.   Room tells the story of Jack and Ma who live together in an 11x11 room, never venturing outside - their only visitor a man named \\"Old Nick.\\"  Jack has spent his entire life inside this room, not knowing that what he sees on TV is anything other than \\"Outside\\" and unreal.  After they make a dramatic escape the story follows what happens to this amazing boy and his mother when Jack is faced with learning that there is so much more to the world than what he grew up with in Room.  I thought reading from the point of view of a 5-year old would be difficult but within the first couple of pages I got used to the language and was completely hooked.   It's at times completely heartbreaking but also amazing.  I don't want to spoil any of it but this is a book that will definitely stay with you long after you finish.   Highly recommended!!

B003JTHESA|4.0|I didn't like most of the songs on this album the first time I heard it. After having listened to it about 20 times I can say that I love 6 of the songs, 2 are good and 2 I don't like.    Like:  Satellite 15..  El Dorado  Coming home  The alchemist  Isle of Avalon  When the wild wind blows    Good:  The Talisman  The man who would be King    The above two would have been great songs too if the shifting of pace/harmony were smoother, it seems jerky and disjoint.    Don't Like:  Mother of Mercy  Starblind  Bad songs in my opinion.    This is a very powerful album, the guitar riffs are very good. I hope they take their time to produce future albums just like this one.
