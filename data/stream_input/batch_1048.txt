B00275EGWY|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. It's got its own kind own slow suspense that never stops, and I was hooked from the start. I don't see this as an anti or pro-war film, simply a story about how it could have been to go to Iraq, and why some do it.
0786891084|2.0|This book was highly recommended on some forum, hence I dashed off and got the audio book from library. Now I realize that I should have checked amazon reviews and saved my time! I agree with many of the reviews here - choppy style, no real character building, etc. The book reader was fine most of the time, but her \\"HA HA HA HA...\\" really grated on my nerves.    I skipped all the chatroom messages and I agree that it would have been much easier to skip with a book than in the audio CD. Similarly the Katie-Toby characters were a repeat of Rosie-Alex and I found myself skipping whenever Katie spoke.     Every time I wanted to know Alex's reaction to some event (like Rosie being pregnant or Alex bringing his snobbish wife to Rosie's decript hotel), there was really nothing said directly! In fact, Alex's reaction about the hotel was buried in the conversation with Katie, who is unrelated to the situation. Even worse, if I remember correctly, there was nothing about Alex's reaction about her being pregnant - it was mentioned in third person that he would be supportive. This seems to be a really inadequate reaction to teenage pregnancy from a dear friend who is also the male lead!     The worst part is, they don't get together until they are 50! There was really no acceptable reason for waiting that long. It made the characters look weak, scared to take risks and not that much of best friends if they could not sense the other's feelings.

0743277708|4.0|Wow, for a story about rabbits, this was a pretty exciting tale.  Adams does a great job of bringing you into the story and making you care about these small critters.  They still retain their rabbitness, but you feel empathy for them as you would another human.<br /><br />When his brother Fiver predicts that tragedy is going to befall their warren, Hazel gathers as many people as will go with him to set off for a new place that will be free from danger.  With a small band of rabbits, they face much hardship and dangerous foes in search of a place they can call home.  Eventually, they come to the Watership Downs and find a place high on a hill that proves to be the perfect spot for their new warren.<br /><br />There is one problem however, the only ones who escaped where males.  They need to have some does in order to get on with their lives.  With a daring plan they set out to gather does only to be brutally beaten by a warlord in charge of another warren.  After nearly dying, they decide to devise a plan and get back at this evil foe and make sure that they expand their warren any way possible.<br /><br />Even though they are rabbits, the characters in this novel are amazing and full of depth.  They all have their own distinct personalities but still act like rabbits.  There is no amazing feats of daring that a normal rabbit couldn't do.  They all operate inside their natural limitations.<br /><br />Adams has an easy going writing style.  I found it particularly interesting that he developed his own \\"language\\" for the rabbits.  As a linguist it was interesting to see how he chose to use both the English language and the rabbit's natural along with the pidgin language they used to communicate with other animals.  It showed great complexity.  His writing is very clear and descriptive and he describes the rabbits movements very accurately.  I could picture easily what events were taking place.<br /><br />As a bit of a warning, as much as this could be a book for children, it has some very violent aspects.  The rabbits fight frequently and their injuries are described in detail.  This could be frightening for younger children.  Another part of the book I didn't particularly care for were the stories the rabbits told.  They just seemed like filler and I wasn't that interested in them.<br /><br />A great book to be sure and I can see why it is highly recommended.  I'll definitely look into his other books and perhaps the cartoon based off of the book.<br /><br />Watership Down<br />Copyright 1972<br />474 pages + maps and Lapine Glossary<br /><br />Review by M.

1593080778|4.0|The book is certainly a classic, which everyone ought to at least try to read once in their lifetime. However, for those attempting to learn the theory of evolution for the first time the book isn't the greatest of places to start for the following reason. The prose are very difficult to understand, and are characteristic of a writing style endemic to England in the 1800's. The sentences are surprisingly very long and I found myself frequently having to reread sentences several times in order to understand their meaning. Additionally points previously made in the book are repeated throughout the book way to much. For those wanting to read the book for historical reasons its great and gives some insight into the times of its writing. For those wanting to learn natural selection for the first time stick with some modern book. I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't so difficult to read.
B001KH68GM|5.0|You know that your finger has fallen well off the pulse of Popular Culture when the Prodigy can release a whole new album & you know nothing about it! Fortunately a good friend showed me the video to the title track and it was as though something long dead inside of me was reawakened: the child of rave who liked nothing more than to jump on a podium and give my all to the newest tracks of the latest acts.<br /><br />This album is a reawakening of the spirit of rave - something many thought was dead & buried, but which has risen again. From the 1st track (which is vivid, addictive and flawless), the album leads you through some hardcore old skool sounds, most noticeably in tracks 2, 3 and 6, but also shows you some of the 'newer' sounds of the Prodigy such as 'Run with the wolves' (7) and 'World's on Fire' (9), which appear to be further along their evolutionary tree than the others.<br /><br />Of course, as others have pointed out, there is nothing especially ground-breaking about this album; just more of the same. However, just like [[ASIN:B000062V8S Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]] reawakened the mind to the scariness of Terminators, so this album refreshes your perception as to how good the Prodigy were and are.<br /><br />So, if you're like me and have had your soul quietened by 9-5 humdrum, then I advise you SERIOUSLY to consider purchasing this album. In doing so, I hope you discover too that it's never too late to be young again...
B0044XV3QY|5.0|The other user reviews hit the nail on the head about this movie and its stunning and ground breaking visual effects, so I won't repeat what they've already said so well.    The review provided by Amazon misses an important point.  It claims that there was a disconnect between the main character's love of gismos and weaponry, and his tree-hugging attitude.  Instead, I would offer that this was obviously part of his character development, not static confusion.  Over time and with the experience of living in a native way, he grew beyond the boy-gizmo-shoot-it-up mentality, into a more holistic and truly powerful frame of mind.  I think this is a parody for how America will hopefully grow out of adolescence (and war/anti environmental mentality) and into a more mature and interconnected mindset.    Along those lines, I liked the clear references to Native or Aboriginal belief systems and ways of being in the world.  Of course it's still entertainment and Hollywood, but if it plants even a seed of understanding - that everything in nature is real, alive, sacred - we may create a better future for our kids.   The fact that these themes were woven into a movie of this scale (and ultimately, popularity) is also truly groundbreaking and a breath of fresh air.    Kudos to Cameron and the crew!
B00172MAO4|3.0|A lot of people take real offence to the idea of a 'best of'. They see it as selling out, giving-the-plebs-what-they-want, etc. Personally, I'm not bothered either way as most bands are in the business of making money these days & Radiohead are no exception (given their tendency to label every album after 'OK Computer' as 'OK Computer 2' in interviews...)<br /><br />If what you're after is the 'Best of Radiohead' then the first CD of this double album does the business.<br />Slightly biased in favour of [[ASIN:B000002TQV The Bends]], it feels like it breaks free of the ethos surrounding everything since 'OK Computer' via its selection of the more textured tracks off of all the albums. Who'd have thought [[ASIN:B00004YTXM Just]] flowed so well into [[ASIN:B0000076JS Paranoid Android]]? Furthermore, who'd have thought the rich darkness of [[ASIN:B00004YTXP Street Spirit]] would work so well with [[ASIN:B00005HYGH Pyramid Song]], 'The Bends' and 'Everything in its Right Place'?<br />If there's one thing to be said about 'Best of's it's that they can play games with a bands back catalogue & blend them in interesting new ways. True - this could be done better by something like the Beatles [[ASIN:B000JK8OYU Love]] - but in the first CD of this album, I felt that something different was achieved with old things.<br /><br />However, move to the second CD and you'll experience a similar effect to switching from a Great novel to its stodgy appendix. CD 2 is dreary and filled with all the bland, second rate stuff Radiohead have done.<br />Admittedly there are exceptions, such as [[ASIN:B001AZNKCO Planet Telex]], although where CD one's ethos made the songs better, CD 2's makes them all the worse.<br /><br />It reminded me of the [[ASIN:B000GI3RZ6 Red Dwarf]] episode 'Demons & Angels'*, where one clone of Red Dwarf was made Heavenly, and the other Hellish. So it is true of this CD that, although the songs are merit-worthy in their place, the bland ones seem to have landed on CD2 and the great ones on CD 1!<br /><br />So, if you want a new experience of Radiohead, I suggest buying CD 1 and seeing the tracks from a new & enlightening perspective. And if you've never heard Radiohead before, then I suggest skipping CD 2 and getting a copy of [[ASIN:B000002TQV The Bends]] and [[ASIN:B001PPF12Q OK Computer]]. By experiencing their finest works and rogueing the bad you will see them for how they really are, and not as some blinkered fans do...<br /><br />* - Apologies for the obscure reference, but Red Dwarf is a popular TV series in the UK.

B003DZX44I|5.0|This movie has always been a top favorite Disney classic of mine, so when I heard it was coming out on blu-ray I had to get it as soon as possible. This blu-ray disc is worth every penny. I expected this to be a great blu-ray. It didn't meet my expectations...it surpassed my expectations. From the second it started, I was blown away by the picture quality. I think that animated movies are the best looking blu-ray's, and this is one of the best. I would honestly out this in my top 3 favorite blu-ray movies of all-time. It is a brilliant movie and a brilliant transfer, and it is worth the investment of a blu-ray player. 10/10 on both the movie and the blu-ray quality.
B004AYCWY4|5.0|When a writer (or an artist) has written their finest work & experienced the adulation & recognition that are beyond their wildest dreams, it is difficult to write a follow-up. Often (as with [[ASIN:B00065XJ52 Encore]] and [[ASIN:B0017WVST2 Long Way Down]]), the follow-up proves weak and attention quickly goes elsewhere.<br /><br />Fortunately this hasn't happened with this book to that degree (although it is a little tired in places - e.g. chapter 8 'You did it yourself in 9 months' and the ending). This book is, like all Dawkins books, an improvement on his last biology book in explaining evolution. Every book since [[ASIN:0192880519 The Extended Phenotype]] has been geared to popularise evolution & help the reader understand it. This book does so very persuasively with incredibly simple arguments in 'The Primrose path to Evolution', leading onto atomic clocks, experiments that have proven evolution and misconceptions about the fossil record.<br /><br />Essentially, if you have a friend who hasn't read Dawkins (shame on them!), then this is a good place to start. Like Ancestor's tale, it makes little mention of religion and God (except Creationists) and is designed to persuade people like the Bishop of Oxford was, who are religious but also believe in evolution. Given the shocking statistic quoted in this book (that 40% of people don't believe in evolution), it is very much your duty to open the doors of perception for these people so that they may see (at least partially) how the World works.<br /><br />That said, this book does have some weaknesses. The digressions Dawkins goes into can sometimes lead off the point & should have been footnoted at the back (as with [[ASIN:0199291152 The Selfish Gene]]). John Cornwell has also criticised Dawkins for quoting his own books and this, unfortunately, is quite common here (as it was with his latest documentary - [[ASIN:B001B8NPL6 The Genius of Charles Darwin]]).<br />One last criticism is that the book [[ASIN:0143116649 Why Evolution Is True]] by Jerry Coyne pops up a little too many times, which makes me wonder if its ideas were lifted for this book. The sources in this book are also not as diverse as some of his other books, and it suffers a little for it.<br /><br />Still, if you can ignore these weaknesses (which are slight), then this is still a good book to persuade those with no scientific knowledge of the truth of evolution. I would suggest, however, that [[ASIN:0753819961 The Ancestor's Tale]] is a more peerless book in this field & I found it much more persuasive even if it is more technical. Knowing the unscholarly as I do, I would suggest getting the audio CD of [[ASIN:0752873210 The Ancestor's Tale]] for those who are unconvinced (since everyone can hear but not all like reading).

B000002MY3|5.0|Two things about this album.<br /><br />First, I saw the video for [[ASIN:B00000JANS Hand in My Pocket]] on a Music Channel list called 'Forgotten Gems of the 90's'. Why it was forgotten, I know not as (to me) it shows  Alanis at the peak of her powers...<br /><br />Second, I listened to this album again in the car and was spellbound by its power as a chillout album. Hence this review - although it is popular, it is forgotten as a chillout classic.<br /><br />From the first track, which is like a sing-along rant (ideal for chilling!) The album sweeps through tracks like [[ASIN:B0000072C1 You Oughta Know]] with serenity (when it should be anger). [[ASIN:B00000JANS Hand in My Pocket]] is, as mentioned, a lesson in chilling, which leads onto the core of the album in the form of the anthemic [[ASIN:B000002KU2 You Learn]]. Such is the brilliance of [[ASIN:B000002KU2 You Learn]], that I scrapped [[ASIN:B000003N4G What a Wonderful World]] off the end of my chillout compilation and replaced it with this - it really does imbue you with hope!<br /><br />From here, the album moves through [[ASIN:B000005S62 Head Over Feet]] and onto [[ASIN:B000009FJ2 Ironic]]. Ironically, this is the one track that spoils the mood due to that whole 'it's-a-song-called-ironic-and-yet-none-of-its-statements-are-ironic-(bar-one!)' gambit. Somehow the dialectic of this song, and its non-conformist nature break the mood of chillout that the rest of the album builds.<br /><br />However, this album is still a masterpiece of chillout and it is a rare album that is perfect in its intention throughout (even if that intention is a by-product). Hence I commend this album for driving after a grueling day at the office, or even just sitting at home. I guarantee you - you won't forget it...
B003Y8YXH6|1.0|Double Fantasy is a masterpiece Lennon solo album. Take out all the Yuck'o Ono songs and you got one Awesome collection. That being said lets talk about this release. Its not needed. Its already been remastered and there's not much difference in my opinion. Now for the stripped version. John would be rolling over in his grave if he new his old demo's were released . And thats all they are are bad home recordings of the songs. Yuck'o must be hurting for cash. Yuck'os voice is HORRIBLE!!
B001D84NKQ|5.0|Funny thing about getting older is it becomes hard to tell whether a music CD is rubbish, or you're just losing your musical faculties. I was listening to a number of albums in the car (e.g. [[ASIN:B0000242VU Mutations]] by Beck & [[ASIN:B000N3SP9C Hot Fuzz Soundtrack]]) and couldn't get the killer hook.<br /><br />Then I played this CD. OH MY GOD is it good! Even though I haven't (yet) seen the film, I got into this instantly.<br /><br />From the first dialogue track ('Ppl ask the question'), the Gangster Rock ethos floods out of the stereo, with awesome tracks such as 'I'm a Man' & 'Rock & Roll Queen'. Highlights also include 'The Gun' by Lou Reed and 'Such a Fool', although every track is the sort of raw, gritty heart-pounding brilliance that one would expect from the title, but which few could deliver...<br /><br />Like all truly excellent soundtracks, this one has a load of tracks you probably haven't heard or (if you have) you can't place (e.g. 'Bank Robber' by the Clash).<br />Furthermore, the dialogue is an excellent selection AND (unlike [[ASIN:B000N3SP9C Hot Fuzz Soundtrack]]) is separated from the music, so it can be sampled by aspiring DJ's.<br /><br />Truth be known, musical appreciation does not fade with age but rather becomes more astute. Not only is this shown by the fact that compilations such as these can be filtered from the usual dross, but also by the fact that Guy Ritchie can still make soundtracks as good as his zenith of [[ASIN:B00000GAKK Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels]] and [[ASIN:B00004YTY1 Snatch]]. Here's hoping the film is as good...
0316069485|4.0|A good, quick read with an engaging plot! If you like legal suspense stories, this is a good one. Although the plot is somewhat predictable, it has some interesting twists that make it a worthwhile read. A defense attorney agrees to take the role of prosecutor for a special, high-profile case with his ex-wife as second chair and his half-brother as case investigator. His unconventional tactics result in controversy, tragedy, and lingering questions of guilt for the protagonist. I received this book free from Goodreads.com and enjoyed the opportunity to experience Connelly's writing for the first time.  As a result, I'm motivated to read more of his work.

0312600844|3.0|I was thoroughly absorbed by Freedom and enjoyed Franzen's view of contemporary American life, where we have an almost \\"anything goes\\" type of morality with no judgments.   I believe that may be what Franzen is writing about: the freedom to do whatever we want regardless of consequences really does destroy us.  Freedom, the novel, fortunately, however, does end on somewhat of a \\"happy\\" note, but not until the unlikable main character's lives are turned completely upside down.  Although many of the author's sentences were laugh-out-loud funny, I still had a nagging depression after reading about so many dysfunctional characters.  My main objection with this novel is the author's prolific use of obscenities that taken out, would certainly shorten the book by several pages.   I enjoyed reading a passage and then was hit in the face with an f-word which shocked me so much that I had to pause in the narrative to regain equilibrium. To me, that is totally unnecessary in good literature.

B003YBNREI|3.0|WORLD GONE CRAZY is being acclaimed as a \\"return to form\\" for the Doobies -- i.e., a return to the pre-Michael McDonald era of THE CAPTAIN AND ME, etc. The truth is that WORLD fits firmly into the *post*-McDonald era of CYCLES, BROTHERHOOD and SIBLING RIVALRY in that it's just a shadow of what the early era produced.    Based on what I've read in recent interviews, the band seems to have decided that the \\"democratic\\" approach used on SIBLING RIVALRY (i.e., all 5 of the core members wrote, and 4 sang lead) was a mistake. Thus they've not only had the usual guys, Tom Johnston & Pat Simmons, do all the singing & writing, but they even seem to have limited those two to one type of song each. Tom only produces basic, good ol' rock 'n' roll pieces (more or less rewrites of songs like \\"The Doctor\\" and \\"Jericho\\"), and Pat only comes up with sappy ballads somewhat reminiscent of \\"Ordinary Man.\\" And that's the real mistake; the variety of SIBLING was hit-and-miss, but it was a far more interesting album than WORLD.    The guys certainly deserve credit for continuing to produce fresh music so long after their debut. But I think they're capable of more than this. There is not one song on WORLD that stands out from the rest in terms of quality, with the possible exception of the nice (if somewhat pointless) remake of 1971's \\"Nobody.\\" On the other hand, no one song stands out as really bad, either (though a couple of the Pat Simmons ballads may come close). And if there's any good news about WORLD, that's it.    The bottom line: If you're enough of a Doobies fan that you listen to, say, BROTHERHOOD, then pick this up. Just don't expect a return to the glory days.    P.S.: The two bonus tracks found on the CD/DVD edition can be easily purchased as downloads, if you just want to get the regular CD version. (Since \\"Law Dogs\\" *stops* rather than *ends* the album, it probably needs those extra tracks to close it.)
0312600844|2.0|This is one of those books we've all been seduced to read because the author's first novel was good.  Not so with Freedom: A Novel!!  Freedom is a very long book with a weak plot and characters that never seem to be going anywhere.  Some of the descriptions which add absolutely NOTHING to the story except nausea are disgusting beyond imagination even for the most avid reader. I had the feeling the author was on the verge of insanity some of the time, and by the time I forced myself to finish Freedom, I was right there with him.  What a disappointment!
030745455X|3.0|The book, like the previous one - The Girl with Dragon Tattoo - is a good thriller with fast moving action and just enough texture on the main characters to keep them clear, like so many other fiction pieces these days, from becoming movie-script flat.  The story of Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander continuous where the first part of the Millennium trilogy left off.  This time is sex trafficking and conspiracy but also revenge and some tender moments as well.  I am not going to spoil it for you; read it yourself.  However, what I found bothering in the first book it became outright irritating in this one (thus only 3 stars): the author was a former member of Swedish Communist Party and clearly an angry anti-free marketeer and it shows (he also comes across as painfully obsessed with women-victims).  Having lived in a Communist country for a part of my life and witnessing the atrocities committed by the well-inteded Marxist do-gooders I found Larsson's naivety and primitive simplifications (when he ventures into his rants about \\"society) hard to stomach.

0786955570|4.0|Like Pandemic, Shadows over Camelot, and others, this is a cooperative rather than competitive board game. The basic premise is a group of adventurers setting out on a quest, of course, but the unique part of Ravenloft is the way that the monsters work. In a lot of cooperative games the rules lay out the challenge for the players, with little to ability to deviate from a set \\"bad things happen card\\". In this game, each player is periodically given control of a monster with rules to follow, making it less about one person versus the rest (such as with Descent) but still giving flexibility to what the monsters can do. For example, the Gargoyle card is dangerous if it spawns near the group, but if it shows up away it will sit there until they get near, whereas the Wolf enemy will rapidly track down and pounce the adventuring party. This also gives an element of strategy to playing the monsters beneficially to the group, as there are some choices the controller makes, for example if two players are the same distance away, it may be more useful to attack the fighter than the mage.    Not only is Castle Ravenloft a fun, cooperative board game, it's also a good introduction to the D&D 4e rules. Everything is simplified into one kind of hit roll, but the basic \\"roll a 20-sided die and match or exceed\\" is a good teaching tool, and the difference between various kinds of powers meshes with the full game. I could imagine a newbie to tabletop games playing Ravenloft, moving on to the D&D Red Box, then following up with 4e or the Essentials series.

0312600844|3.0|I purchased this book based on \\"The Corrections\\" and not because it was an Oprah pick.  However, in Oprah's peddling of her choice as book of the month, she called it an American classic.  It is not.  I really struggled to relate to the characters.  Early on, I could identify the type of liberal family Jonathan created.  But, as Joey's character developed, I just couldn't feel it.  I disliked the enormous gaps in following up on characters such as Patty's family being awol from 20+ years of the novel's plot.  Jess was never really in the story, something like a child in a family that puts all of it's attention on another child and let's the easy one fend for themself.    It is well written.  Parts are just too detailed and far fetched...again, Joey's role in obtaining vehicles and parts is an example. The Free  Space plot was a labored read.    I would not offer this book as a recommendation to my friends, but I would not discourage it, either.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|being a 39 y.o. who grew up with MOST of these \\"toys\\" this trilogy always held a special place in my heart because i also know how painful it is to get rid of some of your most cherished childhood memories. I saw the 3D version in theaters and felt it was an almost perfect ending to the series. I do feel that SOME of the move may be a little intense for real young children but in general is another awesome PIXAR release.    just a little buying advice for collectors who may not know already  - i was at B*ST B*Y today to pick up The Exorcist & One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and happened upon the B*ST B*Y preorder offer for TOY STORY 3 BluRay which is $7.50 down for a preorder for the 3disc edition and you get the STEELBOOK for TS3 - hoping they do the STEELBOOK for TS1 & TS2 when they release TS3
030726999X|4.0|While this book is recommended, I don't think it maintains the page-turning pace of the first two books.  We are taken into the intricate world of Swedish intelligence, the description of which can be pretty boring.  While the first two books were family affairs (Vanger and Salanders), this one is less personal.  I did think, however, that the ending to Hornet's Nest was great.<br /><br />All in all, great trilogy and hat's off to Stieg Larsson.  Wish he could have lived to see the success of his books.
0525951652|1.0|I love Ken Follett's books.  I will put my name on the waiting list for this one at the library.  I will only buy ebooks which are reasonably priced.  Maybe the publishers will get the message and not continue in ratcheting up the price of a no overhead product.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Upgraded the DVD to Blu Ray and it's great and was worth the upgrade since the boys love the movie.  I'm not going to go over the movie since most know what it's about.  If you don't and you have children, get this they should love it.  Esp. boys.
1401917186|4.0|This is a fantastic handbook for yourself and others.  It helped to define me in a way that no other book has yet.
B00000HZH7|5.0|Hard to believe that Primus guitarist/screwball Larry Lalonde, who has dented the collective sanity of all guitar players with cuts like \\"Eleven\\" and \\"Hamburger Train\\" had a hand in this thrash/death classic.  Possessed was the most patentedly Satanic band in the Bay Area - while Slayer used Satanic references strictly for shock value, three of the four members of Possessed walked the walk, with the exception of Lalonde.<br />  But what makes \\"Seven Churches\\" a historical document is the music.  It's said that this CD may very well be the first true death metal album, and based on the barking dog vocals and over-the-top lyrical content, it may be true, or at least be one of the very first.  Possessed were not a slow sludgy outfit like their Floridian kin Obituary or the legendary Morbid Angel.  \\"Seven Churches\\" cruises along at high speed, reminding one of other early thrash greats like Exodus' debut \\"Bonded By Blood\\" and Kreator's \\"Pleasure To Kill\\", another historically important thrash/death hybrid.<br />  People put off by the overdone Satanic shtick should just ignore the vocals since they're hard to understand anyway, but relish the power and energy this band had in its short life span.  Maybe Possessed were too heavy too soon, but the fact is that \\"Seven Churches\\" is a must have for extreme metal fans, and important for its historical value.  A rather poor production, but still a vicious piece of work.
0525951652|5.0|Regardless of what you think is fair pricing for this book, one must agree that the author has done a fine job of researching and writing this historical novel. It is a must-read for any Follet fan! Loved it...
B000ESST6U|5.0|I checked this DVD out from the library a couple times, and loved it so much I just had to buy it on Amazon. While I'm familar with many of Handel's oratorios, this is the first of his operas I've heard. Thankfully, the music is every bit as beautiful and inventive as Handel's oratorios. While virtually lacking in choruses, Giulio Cesare makes up for it by a broader range of arias for most characters. Cleopatra and Caesar, for example, thus come alive as complex characters to a much further extent than (say) those in Saul. One vivdly feels their emotional highs and lows as they progress through the story.    The orchestra deliver a vibrant period-instrument style performance throughout, and all the singers are excellent as well. The production is set in relatively modern times (the Romans resembling British redcoats), and yet the iconic looks associated with Caesar and Cleopatra are fused seamlessly and powerfully into the 20th Century setting. I also found the oft-mentioned \\"dance routines\\" highly effective. They keep things entertaining to look at during the arias, and help accentuate the dance rhythms so common in Baroque music. Watching the DVD, it's obvious how much fun both the audiences and performers were having with this production, and that spirit translates well to the home release.    Overall, to anyone who likes Handel's oratorios, I highly recommend both \\"Giulio Caesar\\" in general, and this performance in particular. This was my first foray into Handel's operas, but it definitely won't be the last.
B000IONL40|4.0|My first reaction was that I was disappointed. And this disappointment sort of justified me, being in the dark about the existence of this current CD. I just recently learned about it on Biography channel, when they featured Meatloaf. I own all of Meatloaf CDs, most are rated from okay to great. H-o-w-e-v-e-r, after listening to this CD several times, it finally draws out or stirs up the emotions of the previous 2 Bat of hell cd's. Of the 3 Bat out of hell cd's, this one is third best; and better then Meatloaf's other titled cd's. If you were to own only one of Meatloaf's cds this would not to be the number 1. But if you had a budget for 3 cd's, buying Bat out of hell 1, 2 and 3 would certainly be worth owning.
B003ZJJFKE|1.0|\\"Satch\\" is all over the place on this one, and i just don't get it. Definitely not for the \\"rock fan.\\"  Just nothing worthy here for me, sorry, but this one bores me to death.
0553805371|3.0|The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow is one of those physic books that, even though the authors have tried their best to simplify the concepts, still takes some work to get your mind to understand. I'm still not sure that the universe is comprehensible no mater how hard the scientists try to make it but I find that this book helps! The words are well chosen to lead you through the world of Quantum Theory, Alternative Histories and The Theory of Everything. Whether or not you can understand your surroundings are up to your education, imagination and in a large part your spiritual beliefs. I found the book to be an informative introduction to a wonders of the universe (as we understand them today!)

B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Bruno Mars may be considered a \\"hook\\" artist by some, but there's no denying the diverse talent he possesses. Definitely looking forward to hearing and seeing more solo projects from him!
B000002H70|5.0|i was born in 1983, so i didn't have the joy of running down to the music store to pick up this release, being that i was to young when this came out.. I actually ran into this album by chance when I was at the Library! From the first listen I was hooked, this album was like painting with sound! I always love \\"THE CURE\\" and always love this album.
1439181780|4.0|I Like this book. I recommend to all who are interested  of low of attraction:)
B0019GJ4EC|1.0|I bought the British copy of this a few years ago and was very disappointed. It's supposed to be a 1080p disc but in my opinion, its just slightly better than a standard-def dvd. The detail isn't there. You know how a true 1080p movie is so clear you can almost see every strand of hair on a person's head? Well that's the kind of picture quality this movie is missing. It's a real shame too, because this has always been one of my favorite movies.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />The USA bluray verison just came out and its 1080p all the way!. FINALLY. It looks fantastic. If you want a copy of this on bluray and haven't bought it yet, be sure to buy the USA version. It runs circles around the UK version, plus it has tons of bonus features. One segment in the bonus features takes you on a tour of all the shooting locations for The Fog. Awesome! A++++!!!
0307454541|3.0|With all the hype surrounding this book, I was expecting to read the best book in the world. This book doesn't live up to the hype at all. I was disappointed.  If a book is really good I can read it within a few days.  It took me over a month to finish this book.  The story is very slow.  3/4 of the book are spent rambling on and on about a bunch of non-sense.  The book doesn't get good until the end and then its over.  I think the book is a build-up of whats to come...I have started reading \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" and it's good and exciting right from the beginning.
0743289692|5.0|If you are ready to get your head out of the sand and confront reality, please pick up this book.  The story itself is great, incredibly educational and inspirational.  It is also nicely written, a book you will not want to put down.  Another suggestion are books by Brad Thor, his weaving of fiction with serious political issues of the moment is delightful.
B003XQM2YU|4.0|Is entertaining, a little bit long. I like a lot Cate Blanchet, but I don't really see chemistry between she and Russel, I still have to say that they manage very well the acting.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I wavered between three and four stars for this read.  I have to agree with other reviewers on a number of grounds, it's a quick read (one sitting), and the perspective is unique.  This is the story of Jack, a five year old held captive in an 11 x 11 shed along with his mother, who is abused regularly by their captor.<br /><br />  The unique perspective is Jack's.  The entire book is written through the eyes of this five-year-old -- plainly speaking it's written in baby talk.  His perspective is precious.  Although clever to a point; frankly, I found it wearing.  I would have preferred that the author change voices for the sake of more cohesive story development, and \\"wholeness\\" of the story.<br /><br />  Did I enjoy this book?  I must answer \\"yes.\\"  I am glad I experienced it.  I would recommend it, but with the caveats above.
0316098337|5.0|The best book I've read in many years and I'm a librarian. I didn't want it to end...  Jack's voice was so fresh and real and the relationship he had with his mother was so powerful.   I laughed aloud at the end when he's staying with his grandparents and all the situations they had together exploring the Outside.  More please!
B001W63DX2|4.0|Watching The Documentary was absolutely great...not a lot of Bands Release A DVD or Documentary Showing Almost All of their privacy backstage and on their free time while they are touring...and watching this from a super band like Maiden Its simply Great and a great purchase not only being a Maiden Fan but Also being a Metal Fan! highly Reccomended
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|Welp i've been a Satch fan ever since i heard Surfing With An Alien back in 87 when i was around 12 or so, my cousin turned me onto it, and i was like wow this dude shreds. It wasn't until 89's Flying In A Blue Dream that i really stood up and took notice of how talented Joe really was and how hard his stuff was to play(or attempt). The main thing about Joe is he is a song writer, not just a shredder who puts down some mundane or mediocre tracks that all follow the same routine and all sound alike. Sure you have incredible players like Petrucci, Loomis, Vinnie Moore, Paul Gilbert etc. But they just don't have what Joe has, that style. When he plucks the string you know its him, and also he doesnt go by any book and follow routine after routine with six string sweeps, special phrasing, and certain modes. Joe is an entity all his own, just like Vai who i should mention as well, thats why they are the two biggest solo guitarist(all guitar) of all time. Well getting down to Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards, Joe goes back to some old roots while keeping the fresh watered ones alive.    This album is packed with very versatile material as most of his albums are. Premonition kicks off with that good ole Joe styled low distorted riff that we all know and loves while skewing into a nice chorus that reminds you of stuff off of Crystal Planet, a lot. A lot of the album follows that route along with some new things. The half-title track Wormhole Wizards is awesome, very creepy traveling through space like intro, with a great solid minor bass line that follows through the whole song without change. Making it a very good rythm section for the song. Also in this song along with a few others there are keyboards in the back, and actually on the fore mentioned track there is a keyboard solo, a first for a Joe Record? Perhaps. All the tracks are great and have there own style, as usual. But all the while you listen you know its Joe. The great thing about his playing and what has always made it so difficult to mimic(though semi-duplicated, but not spot on) is the way he uses arpeggios, and his use of hard/soft/and no picking, which is something lots of players try but it ends up sounding like crap. Listen to George Lynch you'll see what i mean.    So i can't pick just one song to sit and talk about although i think my favorite are the two i mentioned along with, God Is Crying, Dream Song, The Golden Room, and pyrrhic victoria(whatever that means)! I should also mention that God Is Crying is a really good throw back to old school Joe and something off the Extremist. Most songs do sound like they are from the Crystal Planet era and some even sound like a \\"better\\" version of Engines Of Creation, which wasn't bad just different. So if you like good ole Joe pick this up, its about time some originality came back to guitar playing, and Joe just has those songs that you can hum and really get stuck in your head. I really like Vai, but he really hasn't done much worth in the last decade or so, mostly experimental stuff, and not an album of really catchy songs like Passion And Warfare which was no doubt his best. So how does this rate, well along with the earlier albums its right next to Is There Love In Space, which was his best album in the last ten years, so tack this one on as well. The others were great but didn't seem to have \\"as much\\" catchy material, except for maybe Crowd Chant, Redshift Riders, Theme For A Strange World and Andalusia, which were some of my favorites from the last albums. Joe has never had a \\"bad\\" album that you could say wow this sucks, he's just had some records that were a little uninspired perhaps. But make no mistake he has broken that trend with Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards. Also the title track Wormhole Wizards, is without the Black Swans, i really thought there would be a song called that, whats up with that Joe? :) Enjoy.!
B0012GMX1K|5.0|Octopus seems like a turning point for the band because it marked the addition of drummer John Weathers who brought a somewhat harder edge to the band's music. Although I've never been a fan of \\"Knots\\" (you either are or you aren't) most of the rest of the album is brilliant. The two opening tracks, \\"The Advent of Panurge,\\" and \\"Raconteur Troubadour,\\" are IMO the strongest two songs to open any Gentle Giant album. \\"Think of Me With Kindness is certainly one of Kerry Minnear's most beautiful songs, and don't forget the final track, \\"The River,\\" a dark and grooving song with some nice textural overlays. More daring that \\"Three Friends\\" and more cohesive than \\"Acquiring the Taste,\\" it's easy to see why many GG fans rate Octopus as their favorite.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Russell Crowe got robbed - I demand a recount.  Jennifer was great, but he needs more props.  Wonderful film.  Fantastic music.  Magical locations and scenery.
B0030U1U6A|4.0|In a Glass House is probably the most rocked-out Gentle Giant album. Although there are a couple of songs I don't really care for, the album is more than redeemed by \\"The Runway,\\" \\"Experience,\\" and the title track, which for me,  rank as the best trio of songs on any Gentle Giant album. Also this album stands apart because it really doesn't sound much like their other releases. It's different from all the rest, yet still brilliant. With the departure of Phil Shulman from the group, Gentle Giant lost some of its signature textures, however this album along with the two that followed it, (Power & Glory & Free Hand) demonstrate that the band still had much greatness ahead of it. It's easy to see why some rate \\"In a Glass House\\" as their favorite. It's definitely in the top 3 or 4.
B003L77TZI|5.0|Love Teenage Dream, and California Gurls, and Firework, etc.  All songs are great!!!  Katy Perry Rocks!!
B003ITZBW2|5.0|I will keep this short, this is a really good story and a lot of action. The characters are very well casted, animation is great and the story keeps you very involved. I highly recommend this movie but especially to those who know these characters and love them. Be aware this is not the 60's or 70's Batman, this story line is dark and violent, so I would not recommend this for the kiddies thats for sure. JB
B003ZK58WM|1.0|The price for this eBook is outrageous (more than the hardcover edition!) Send a message to the publisher that we consumers will not be bilked out of our money to satisfy their greed: do not buy the Kindle edition of this book at this price.

B003UYUQZW|4.0|Mirroring the same grand course that Disney charted in the Pirates of the Caribbean, Prince of Persia makes its mark right from the first minutes of the film.  When we first meet the Prince, he is cut from the same `street rat' cloth as Disney's Aladdin.  But much like that tumbling protagonist, the Prince quickly rises to royal status while not losing sight of where he came from.  Jake Gyllenhall brings a lot of heart and personality to Prince Dastan as he meets the princess Tamina and discovers the secrets of the dagger powered by the Sands of Time.    Jerry Bruckheimer takes the audience straight into the action with vast sweeping deserts, majestic spired cities, and a soundtrack that should really be experienced in your home theater.  The energy is as kinetic as you might expect for a film based on a videogame.  Through a series of events Dastan and the dagger are pursued up the walls, across the rooftops, and through of the caves of this adventure.    The supporting cast really brings the film to vibrant life.  Gemma Arterton is marvelous as the fiery princess Tamina who has been entrusted with the mystical secret of the dagger.  Ben Kingsley plays the Prince's uncle and is the polar opposite of his Ghandi character as he leads Dastan and his royal brothers on a very personal quest of his own.    I've been a gamer for years, and have always been leery about taking characters from a console and transplanting them on the big screen.  Prior to seeing the film, I had not played any of the Prince of Persia games.  Now I've got one on order and - in an ironic twist - I hope that it can live up to the film.
B0030U1TW0|5.0|Free Hand is the last great Gentle Giant album. Everything here works for me except \\"Time to Kill,\\" which seems like a failed attempt to mix the Gentle Giant sound with pop lyrics and pop background harmonies (the beginning of the end?). \\"Just the Same,\\" the title track and the other tracks are very solid and therefore this is probably one of the most \\"complete\\" Gentle Giant albums. \\"On Reflection\\" is an impressive accomplishment, (\\"Knots\\" done right, as it were), and Talybont is perhaps the band's most impressive \\"medieval\\" composition. The final track, \\"Mobile\\" is another strong track, blending the GG sound with a rousing Celtic-inspired tune. \\"Free Hand\\" is another near-perfect album from Gentle Giant, and the band would never reach these heights again.
B002VPE1AW|2.0|Its not that Avatar is a bad movie as such, it just takes sooooooo loooooonnnnnggggg to get anywhere. I have watched it several times, but have never felt that its a great movie. There is too much fluff in the movie before it gets to the final fight. Over-hyped and over-rated.
0240816250|5.0|\\"Way Beyond Monochrome\\" second edition could be described as a comprehensive masterwork on traditional photography.  Authors Ralph Lambrecht and Chris Woodhouse take the photographer on a journey from the basics of visualisation and print control, through presentation and display of prints, into a thorough treatment of the science of photography.  Detailed but clearly-written text is accompanied by a wealth of explanatory figures and photographs.  Although the focus of the book is mainly on traditional film photography, digital photography is also covered with an emphasis on digital negative technology.  This book is highly recommended to photographers of all levels as it combines in one place all the important elements of the craft of photography.
B003YCI1PM|3.0|I loved Selena and the scenes first album, it was fun it was spunky, it was hardcore tween pop/rock. So with AYWR Selena grew up... a little! The sound is better, auto tune helps, but she didnt need it, she wanted trancey dance music, and thats how u do it. Selena set out to make a dance techno album and made a dance pop album, its not bad, but its not techno. The two lead singles are catchy and fun, OFF THE CHAIN and GHOST OF YOU are major standouts, while ROCK GOD is simply awful written by Katy Perry even she knew it wouldn't work. This album is good is solid, but I wish she would have stuck to her original sound! If you want a good dance alnum for the younger crowd, try Emily Osment, Fight Or Flight!
B0010V4TZU|2.0|Got this by Suggestion and have to say it's weak musically...  It's more \\"boy band\\" than great tunes, and that's not to say these kids aren't talented - clearly they are.  But for a full-priced studio offering you really have to compare it to something like Chicago's first LP when those guys were about the same age to get a sense of what I'm talking about...  Sorry but I was disappointed.
B003Y8YXH6|2.0|If you're old enough, try to remember what the vibe was in the fall of 1980.  This new John Lennon album called DOUBLE FANTASY had come out and it was tanking on the charts.  And with good reason.  First, a single play-through of the record revealed that John's songs were relatively weak.  He'd been hanging out inside the Dakota smoking bong hits for years, not even bothering to pick up a guitar, and it showed.  The session players were energetic, but John's melodies and lyrics were sub-par.  And then there was the issue of having the album appear in the form of a \\"dialogue\\" between John and Yoko.  It's a fanciful idea, but all it really did was keep people from playing the John side and leaving the Yoko side silent.  Her songs were typically polarizing.  And in all honesty, has there ever been a more over-praised artist in history than Yoko Ono?  If John Lennon hadn't fallen in love with her she'd be nowhere.  Certainly not a musician.  A minor art world figure at best.      The album debuted at #27 in the UK, reached as high as #14, but then it fell down very quickly to #25 and then #46. In the US, the album debuted at #25 and remained out of the top 10.  But then, of course, after John was killed Double Fantasy started hopping off the shelves and we were inundated with second-rate songs like (Just Like) Starting Over and the smug, self-aggrandizing Watching the Wheels on the radio.  Everyone felt the need to be kind to the record, which now took on this totally unjustified significance.  But the fact that John died just after its release is irrelevant.  Stripped or Un-Stripped DOUBLE FANTASY is a tame, lame rock & roll record - musically unadventurous and lyrically sedate - and just about the last thing I would ever listen to if I wanted to hear some great John Lennon music.
B0012GMX2Y|5.0|For me \\"Three Friends\\" is the band's first truly great album. It seems more musically solid and cohesive than its predecessors. It's a bit more laid back than later releases but all the songs seem to fit nicely together from start to finish. Despite the fact that apparently the band never played much of \\"Three Friends\\" live, there are some absolute Gentle Giant classics here, including \\"Prologue,\\" \\"Peel the Paint,\\" and \\"Mr. Class and Quality.\\" I believe that this is perhaps the best album for showcasing all the Shulman brothers musical talents, especially Phil. Free-for-alls can be fun (Acquiring the Taste), but rules are nice as well (Three Friends). This is a near-perfect album and still my favorite.
B001M4YZ90|5.0|was married to that narcissistic monster Madonna.<br /><br />This is a work of a genius. A man who knows a good laugh and how to sustain a good plot. Its truly a guy's movie. A definite keeper. Watchable over and over again.
B0025KVLUG|5.0|I was only 15 when I bought this brand spanking new masterpiece in January, 1969. It was hugely popular and hip on a widespread scale. Although we were aware it had fewer songs than the Fab's previous LPs, it was and still remains ground-breaking. Any fan without it has an incomplete and vital element missing from his or her collected works of the Beatles.     Yellow Submarine did not inveigle my interest into wanting more, but rather sparked my approval and appreciation of the added gift we'd been provided. It may not have had the abundant tracks found on previous Beatles' works, but what Yellow Submarine lacked in that respect, it made up for in quality. The sheer brilliance and productivity of these guys, coupled with Sir George Martin's lavish contribution, certainly justified their authorization to give us something sudden and astonishing, - a token treat, if you will, having come off the back end of the prolific White Album just weeks prior. The Beatles (the White Album) is the delicacy and Yellow Submarine - the sweet and delectable parfait, its complimentary counterpart.     The 2009 remastering is simply exquisite. This is classic pop culture by any standard.

B003QCCS36|5.0|I heard \\"Beg Steal or Borrow\\" in the car the other day, a Joni Mitchell song, and was so captivated by the vocal that I had to get the album. LaMontagne's voice is eerily similar to a rich female contralto. I picture a 40-year-old black woman when I listen to him, you simply cannot tell a man is singing.     My other favorite track is Repo Man, where the voice is raspy but still high enough to be a falsetto for most men. Not this guy. Puts Roy Orbison to shame. The accompaniment is professional and crisp, I particularly like the steel guitar.
B000001FW9|3.0|Although there are some solid compositions here I see \\"Acquiring the Taste\\" primarily as an experiment in different sounds and textures, some of which would eventually morph into the trademark Gentle Giant sound. For me the standout tracks are \\"Pantagruel's Nativity,\\" \\"The House, The Street, The Room,\\" and \\"Plain Truth,\\" all three of which give listeners a glimpse of things to come. Other songs like \\"Wreck,\\" and \\"Black Cat,\\" simply don't work for me. So, while others consider \\"Acquiring the Taste\\" a brilliant expression of \\"progressive rock,\\" I view this 2nd album from Gentle Giant as an interesting stepping stone to much greater things.

Maybe he was a jerk and this book was just a PR effort in those days of empire.<br /><br />I find it remarkable that a man's wisdom from centuries back can dovetail in a world full of facebook narcissists and text messaging hollow-brains. His reflections on life and leadership give much to think about. Makes a good follow up to Machiavelli's Il Principe.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|After searching for a backpack style for my Sony A550 with extra accessories, I literally just stumbled across this backpack.  Didn't even realize Amazon offered a \\"generic\\".  The other name brand backpacks are either too big or too small for my every day use or just too expensive.  This backpack is the PERFECT size and the perfect amount of compartments.  It is the size of a normal school backpack and the padded shoulder straps make it super comfortable.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I have not had it long enough yet to know really how durable it is going to be, but so far am far beyond happy with this bag.
B0021L8V1G|4.0|You would think that a 2 disc edition of a movie like Iron Man 2 would be loaded with special features. Maybe something like how they did Whiplash, behind the scenes, cast interviews, a little history on the characters Whiplash, WarMachine, Black Widow and Justin Hammer, etc. No they have the following:    -Commentary  -4 Deleted Scenes (2 extended, 1 alternate and 1 deleted scene)  -Behind the scenes on the Iron Man and WarMachine costumes mixed how they did some scenes involving them  -A little documentary on making the Stark Expo set  -The Shoot to Thrill by AC/DC music video  -The digital copy of the movie    These were all good but I would expect more especially if you pay the $22.99 or whatever you paid for the movie. They could have excluded the digital copy and crammed all the features into the 1 disc edition which only has commentary. Then also sell the movies in another edition with the digital copy.    Now for the movie. I dont care what people thought. I really enjoyed the movie. I have no idea what they mean by No story. I want reveal much so it wont spoil the movie. But you can clearly tell what the storyline is right off the bat.     It deals mostly with the \\"Demon in a Bottle\\" storyline which is considered the best Iron Man story ever. Iron Man deals with a new villian Whiplash (ok its a hybrid of Whiplash and Crymson Dynamo) played by Mickey Rourke. Other new characters include Natalie Rushman aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson) and Justin Hammer.    The movie does have an issue of introducing too many characters but that can be ignored. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has a bigger role in this as he appears in a few scenes (mainly about talking about \\"The Avengers\\") as apposed to his after the credits scene in the first.    Like the first, there is an extra scene after the credits that sets up for Marvel's next big movie.    Set aside the lack of special features. Good movie to own
1423101472|4.0|My son does not like to read and his teacher hooked him up with this  series and he is actual asked for the last book and is reading it.
1600247253|5.0|If you are a Harry Bosch fan this book was worth the wait.  In his typical fashion Connelly kept me up late with his constant action and a good amount of suspense.  The book felt a bit rushed at times.  There was not the same amount of Harry Bosch navel gazing that I've seen in other books.  Telling the story through the person of Bosch's half brother, the Lincoln Lawyer, got a bit confusing in places.  The only thing I found off-putting was some of the contrived names he came up with like Bill Clinton for a Theater Operations manager / witness, and Gilbert and Sullivan for a pair of NARCs that work West Hollywood.  In truth, this is a typical Connelly device.  Maybe it is starting to wear a bit thin on me.  One thing is sure; Harry Bosch has not lost his charm, or his drive to catch the bad guy.  I gave the book a generous 5 stars.<br /><br />I bought the Kindle edition and do wish it was a bit cheaper. I feel robbed because I can't share it with my son without giving him my Kindle for a week.
B003UERZ88|2.0|Or soulless if you prefer. I think both Crucible and Resurrection are the best metal discs I've bought in the past 5 years, while this is one of the worst.. no wait, it is the worst. Most of the songs at BEST feel like leftovers from some pop metal band, at worst it sounds like a band experimenting in a new genre; \\"sportsmetal\\". Gawd, the lyrics are a complete 180 from Crucible and the playing is even further away from it. 'Til The Day I Die' is actually interesting and is my favorite here but many songs I couldn't even make it through all the way.... ONCE. Just too painful. Heartless, Made of Metal, Matador, Undisputed.... terrible. This disc seems like a contract obligation and not a bonafide effort -- at least that's what I'm going to tell myself.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I loved this movie and just couldn't believe how well-made it was.<br /><br />UK actors are always so developed in their craft- they way they feel through and perform the characters. Ioann Gruffud was subdues but intense and Romola Garai was just glowing. Albert Finney was a big surpise while Rufus Sewell was just perfect.<br /><br />I know my history quite well and always focus my book-buying toward that but I never knew about this part of of history. It definitely opened up a whole world of knowledge on it. A definite keeper.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|What else can be said other than what 503 other reviewers have already stated.  The Eagles have got to be if not the best than at least in the top three super bands of all time.  From the vocals to the instrumentation to the personalities, the Eagles continue to soar high above the clouds making today's musical attempts at song writing and performing seem so contrite and generic.  They even sounded better in this concert than they did in the 70's.  All four sounded simply perfect in their solo performances and totally awesome in their harmonization.  Even Joe Walsh's voice was impeccable.  If I had to nitpick on any of the performances is that I missed the banjo originally played by ex-Eagle Bernie Leadon in \\"Take it Easy\\".  I was also a little disappointed when an interviewer asked Don Henley what he enjoyed most about performing and his response was \\"playing the last song in the set\\".  Somehow I think this was tongue-in-cheek but it no less took away from a fan's perception that they really enjoy what they're doing.  If he did mean it, it's understandable after performimg many of the same songs for 40 years.  A super dvd, a super concert, and a super band.  I'll never get tired of watching it.
0061989142|5.0|A good book with basic advice that is often forgotten in a pinch.  Conrad also includes tricks of the trade that are quite handy.  Its comprehensive and an overall delightful read.
B003YBNRHU|4.0|Like an old shoe... a term of endearment.    The boys have aged like a fine wine and they project feels like an old shoe. They bring the Doobie harmonies and song writing back around. It sounds great. I actually love the latin groove in OLD JUAREZ. NOBODY is just classic Doobies. CHATEAU rocks. WORLD GONE CRAZY chugs on like a train. You can't help move the body.     I'll admit, I'm not a fan of the McDonald years. So Don't Say Goodbye is meh. Pat Simmons I love ya man and your previous work, but the two songs here, just sound so out of place here.     So this album is mixed bag of some great rock, with a couple of tracks that really trip me up. Still, my problem.     I highly suggest picking this up. I am so grateful the boys are still together, touring and producing projects like this.
B0000028MA|5.0|Listening to this CD brings back the 90s perfectly. Early Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and the late Andrew Wood, as well as the lighter sounds of Paul Westerberg bring it all back!
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I thought the final season was one of the best. Even though I had been warned by so many friends who had viewed it earlier that it was a waste of time and a huge disappointment. I thought the writing/plots were very well executed. I found the episode exploring Richard Alpert's past quite entertaining; and the exclusion of Ana Lucia from the gathering because she \\"wasn't ready yet\\", hilarious. Sure, I, like so many other LOST viewers, never had all of my questions answered (Walt's \\"specialness\\"?), but at the same time, I truly enjoyed the ride from the beginning to the end. I think most of those that felt let down by LOST were those who wanted all the answers presented on a silver platter, and all the twists resolved. It wasn't going to happen. Just like life. So instead, the writers left alot of up to your intepretation - that was the best part of the whole ride!
0307594777|5.0|It has been  a long time since I read books that I couldn´t put down.  Character development is awesome, I knew and empathized with the main characters.  After I finished the last one I wanted to read another.  Maybe I´ll re-read all of them.
B003ZK58WM|3.0|I have always enjoyed Follett's books and have looked forward to reading this novel.  I travel extensively and thought this hefty work would be perfect for my Kindle but the price is just too high.  This is not the fault of Amazon but the publisher.  I suggest an email to the good folks at Penguin to let them know how you feel.  If enough of us write maybe they will modify the price.
B00006IWGY|4.0|Cd came before time and was pre-sealed and wrong cd without extra track like it stated but, I was refunded.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|Bruno Mars certainly had one of the more anticipated debut albums of 2010.  After superb turns with other artists (\\"Nothin' On You\\" with B.o.B and \\"Billionaire\\" with Travie McCoy), Mars struck out on his own with his solo #1 hit, \\"Just the Way You Are.\\" Mars's debut is not as perfect as the Billy Joel lifted title, but [[ASIN:B003ZJ0ZX0 Doo - Wops & Hooligans]] possesses more than enough solid moments over it short ten tracks at thirty-five minutes total to be both enjoyable and promising for Mars's future.  Hopefully, Doo-Wops & Hooligans strikes more a chord than some recent albums by debut artists, namely the dismal selling, though enjoyable[[ASIN:B003R4JB56 31 Minutes to Takeoff]] by soulful pop singer Mike Posner.  Additionally, let's hope his recent run-in with the law (a felony) does not degrade a promising career.<br /><br />\\"Grenade\\" opens the album off a bit oddly, finding Mars contrasting his usually polished, lazy vocals with more overt, forced vocals.  \\"Grenade\\" sounds the slightest bit clunky at times and does not represent Mars as the crooner that we've (the listeners) have come to know him as.  He has some nice vocal moments, achieving some soulful grit that listeners have also desired to hear, but he overdoes the nuances vocally.  \\"Grenade\\" does grow on you after a couple of listens, but despite its sound production work, it is eclipsed by much better cuts from 'Doo-Wops & Hooligans.' Think of \\"Grenade\\" as a bit of `false-start.'<br /><br />\\"Just The Way You Are\\" atones for any questions of Mars's credibility that may be raised from the left-field \\"Grenade.\\" Here the songwriting is much better executed and the production work is simple, yet beautiful and captivating.  \\"Just the Way You Are\\" is the valedictory cut by all means, accentuated by a schmaltzy, yet sincere refrain: \\"when I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change, cause you're amazing, just the way you are...\\"  \\"Our First Time\\" rivals the greatness of \\"Just the Way You Are,\\" only missing its superbness by a few short notches.  Initially, the reggae-tinged cut may be a bit `off-putting,' but quickly one feels the lazy vibe suits Mars perfectly.  Again, the songwriting is strong with another catchy, though not revolutionary hook (\\"just go wit it... and I will go real slow wit it... it's our first time\\").  But let's face it, the charm of Mars's vocal makes up for the corniness right?<br /><br />\\"Runaway Baby\\" is like \\"Grenade\\" in the sense that it is a bit awkward.  Mars thrives on lazier cuts as opposed to up-tempo numbers that degrade his vocal polish slightly.  But he once again atones for this with a the enjoyable and lyrically relevant \\"Lazy Song\\" which finds  Mars referencing the rap song \\"Teach Me How To Dougie,\\" among other absurdities.  \\"Lazy Song\\" is enjoyable because of Mars' consummate pop culture references and `stream of consciousness' approach in addition to it brief 3:20 length.<br /><br />\\"Marry You\\" is solid, though it sounds similar in conception and sound to \\"Just the Way You Are,\\" lifting the underlying progression.  Despite this, the production is clever, the drums are big sounding quoting the 1980s, and the corny `wedding bells' are actually a clever addition.  \\"Talking to the Moon\\" slows the tempo once more, showing off the beauty of Mars's vocals.  The production is solid and while \\"Talking to the Moon\\" also sounds similar to previous cuts (namely the progression is similar to \\"Billionaire\\"), Mars pulls it off incredibly well.  It is another nice addition to the track list.<br /><br />\\"Liquor Store Blues,\\" featuring Damian Marley is as enjoyable as everything else here.  Again, Mars favors a reggae-tinged approach, but it bodes well for him.  The hook is clever once again: \\"one shot for my pain, one drag for my sorrow, get messed up today, I'll be ok tomorrow.\\"  Marley is surprisingly tamer than usual here, not stealing Mars's thunder in the least.  \\"Count On Me\\" finds Mars sounding like a mix between Jason Mraz and Jack Johnson; the cut itself channels recent Plain White T's hit single \\"1,2,3,4\\".  There is nothing monumental here, but some smart choices are made to omit drums from the production work and add nice, lush strings.  Closing cut \\"The Other Side,\\" featuring Cee-Lo Green and B.o.B is another standout, and the perfect choice to close this effort.  It is uptempo, but Mars sounds better than previous uptempo cuts, though it may be Cee-Lo Green that steals the show.  B.o.B.'s verse is strong, additionally.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid debut album on all accounts.  It is short, but given the fact that Mars' relies on lazy grooves for his best vocal performances, the short length bodes in his favor;  a longer album would have knocked the quality down a notch most likely.  Vocally, there is room for more maturity for Mars, but if given the chance, I think that we as the listeners can expect it on his NEXT album.  Strong debut; 3 1/2 starsannels recent Plain White T's hit single \\"1,2,3,4\\".  There is nothing monumental here, but some smart choices are made to omit drums from the production work and add nice, lush strings.

B0019HQIGS|3.0|I have been enjoying John's music for a while now but almost wish I had just stuck with listening to his music. Although the concert scenes are enjoyable and show what an incredibly talented and driven musician he is, I find it hard to get over how much he thinks of himself.   The movie starts with John driving his Mercedes with his lap dog on his lap, rambling on about himself. And that's not where it stops, throughout the entire movie he keeps telling the viewer or his live audience how fantastic and succesful he thinks he is.   If you like his music (which I do), rather just get the cd or download his music off the internet for free. Judging by his fancy car and watch collection he does not need the money anyway.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Another movie my daughter needed and we got at Amazon. This was a used movie, but in the best condition ever, just like new!!
B001EN71CW|5.0|This show was a blind buy for me. I read some really good reviews from fans of the show and i enjoyed the film Serenity so i figured i couldn't go wrong. Boy was i right. This show was the most fascinating Sci-fi shows i have seen. It was a treat to watch.
0385342047|3.0|Becky and her outlandish justifications for her 'addiction' can be rather silly.    Becky, Luke and Little Minnie are still living with Becky's parents.  Apparently, they have tried numerous times over the past two years to move out, but something always happens.  Five times to be exact!  But really this book is about Becky planning a special surprise birthday party for her dear Luke and how keeping it a secret starts to spiral out of control.  When we see Becky scrambling to hide her plans from Luke, whether it be Becky trying to barter for services (two young teens show up hoping to get the Marc Jacobs handbags Becky promised and in exchange they will be the fire eaters at Luke's party, a talent the young man apparently learned off YouTube!) or finding out that just a few more people than she would like know about the party (about 600 people know to be exact!), hilarity ensues and I found myself laughing out loud and feeling for our struggling heroine.    But there's the other side...Becky's shopping addiction is ridiculous, and I found myself shaking my head in annoyance.  I don't know if it has anything to do with today's economy, but I just found myself shaking my head in annoyance as Becky shows us once again just how clueless she is when it comes to spending money.  I mean, come on!  They are still living with her parents, but for some reason little Minnie (all of two years old) needs a pair of designer Ugg's?  I looked it up, our heroine dropped $315 US dollars for little shoes for Minnie.      Now, I realize it's fiction, but I want to enjoy my heroines, not be annoyed by their silly antics.  If Becky were the 'evil one' in the story, no problem, but she isn't!  She's the main character, and I dont' like being annoyed with my main characters, not unless they learn their lesson and set about trying to better themselves, which sadly did not happen here.    I wont' lie, the ending sets up a rather interesting premise for Kinsella's next Shopaholic book, and Iwill probably read it, but I enjoy Becky more when she's trying to work herself out of scraps rather than just spending money and then trying to justify it.
0385737424|5.0|I just finished \\"When You Reach Me\\" and was blown away by the depth of this small novel. What excited me the most how the themes of \\"Growing Up\\" and \\"Science Fiction\\" blended so well together. But unlike \\"Ender's Game\\", where the science fiction tends to be just as large of a theme (if not larger) than the \\"Growing Up\\", this book focuses on Miranda's childhood and then throws in some science fiction to spice it up.     I don't want to say too much because I fear giving away the plot! All I'll say is this - I couldn't stop reading it, all the while rooting for Miranda's life. This was an excellent story which I will recommend to many people, for many years to come!
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Is this for real? I am utterly shocked to see how the mercenary publisher is once again so out of touch!  It's all about their margin and profits instead of passing the real digital savings to readers.  Instead, they choose repeatedly to ignore it, so ridiculously upending the price to cost more than a digital! I bet they must be thinking that, since it's a heavy 1000 pager and that people would not like to buy hardback, so this would be a real good time to whack the customers for the convenience of ebook.  Goes to show how they failed to price products according to the real cost of production/demand/supply.  When are they going to get it!!?  I hope they go bankrupt soon and let the new generation of entrepreneurs set the game change in their industry and wipe them to extinction.   I love to read Follett's, but I'm not supporting the publisher this time.  At the expense of the writer, too bad!
B003BW0CB6|4.0|THE REVERSAL is not Michael Connelly's best book in his long running series.  It is a good read, bringing a number of his most popular characters together into one story.  It lacks the plot twists experienced Connelly readers would expect.       The story contains a number of \\"reversals.\\"  First, an old murder case is reversed on appeal.  Career defense attorney Mickey Haller's role is \\"reversed\\" into becoming the prosecutor in the re-trial.  Detective Harry Bosch, loner and emotional cripple, is \\"reversed\\" into becoming the single parent of his thirteen year old daughter after the death of his ex-wife in last year's novel NINE DRAGONS.  Prosecutor Maggie \\"McFierce\\" has the reversed role of working with her ex-spouse, Haller - long her legal adversary.    All in all, this story came off a bit flat.  Long time Connelly readers that waited eagerly for THE REVERSAL might be under-whelmed.      For the new Connelly reader, I would recommend you start with THE LINCOLN LAWYER.  One of his best in the series.  Soon to be a movie starring Matthew McConaughey.  (Maybe he can keep his shirt on for that one, but I doubt it...)
B003DZX44I|5.0|This new release and digitally remastered copy is a wonderful addition to any collection! One of the best Disney movies of all time!
B0006WIP90|5.0|When my daughter was a little girl this was one of her favorite books and we read it almost nightly, to the point that I knew the dialogue by heart. Now she is expecting her first child and, as requested by the good friend who hosted her baby shower, we all brought a book along to begin the baby's library. Amazon gave me the option of finding this book, the original one, in excellent condition, at a decent price. I was able to give her almost the very same book she grew up with that she'll now be able to share with her child....thanks, so much, Amazon.
1439181780|3.0|This book is a lot like the first one. It is a good refresher if you haven't read the secret in awhile, but if you had just read it this book would seem redundant.
0452295548|5.0|Absolutely fascinating book. The reader is taken on a journey of Jill Bolte Taylor's stroke, from first indication to complete recovery.  Although technical in one sense, this is written clearly enough for everyone to understand--and be amazed.
B001RCD2DW|2.0|I wrote this review to warn people that unless they have another $500 for headphone amplification, and their own sound-isolation room, and really enjoy playing with an equalizer, or just in case they are able to differentiate between price and performance, they may want to look elsewhere.    Pros:  - Circumaural headphones are wonderful, and these ear cups are very comfortable  - Great build quality  - If the sound engineer was wearing these, you might hear it as they did (true for any headphones, really...)    Cons:  - The headband gets uncomfortable quickly    Open-air Cons:  - You can hear everything around you right through them, so you turn up the volume  - People in the area then complain that your headphones are too loud for them to concentrate  - Dismal bass performance (yes, I've broken them in for ages)    I listened to these constantly for 4 months.  One week, I was working out of town, and had only my Sennheiser headset with me, when one of my favorite low brass quartets (okay, I'm a nerd) popped up on my playlist.  I realized suddenly that this was the best they had sounded in 4 months!  When I also realized that my head hadn't hurt at all in the last week of wearing the headset, I was motivated to come warn you away from these headphones.    I'm told that despite the nothing-special impedance of these headphones, that they are unsurpassed given \\"proper amplification\\".  Proper amplification seems to be defined as anything for which you paid more than $500.  This leaves me wondering if the headphones come alive, or just the person throwing out money like they ditched their gamblers anonymous meeting to go to the track.    Finally, for what it's worth, opinions about these headphones are sharply disparate, and another 2-star review here was from someone who felt the 701s he had were much better... which he admits makes no sense.  Unlikely as it seems, perhaps AKG has quality control issues, or a single QC guy that hates bass; I'm not sure.
B000OZ0N9E|3.0|-- I posted the following review as a comment a few months back and have now elevated it to a review. --   Most all examples and sidebars are rendered off the screen as they are incorrectly formatted for the Kindle. To read these examples / sidebars, you need to use the 5-way navigator to move right/left/right/.... for EACH single line. That's horrible. What's bad is that the issue exists even on Kindle DX (3rd gen). So bad such a great book is alienated by this disgusting issue. I lodged a complaint with the publisher though and they say they have forwarded it to the Digital Books Department. Hopefully, they'll roll out an update. I'll repost if I get any update.   Here are the ticket numbers (just in case if someone from the publishing / development team is reading this): 100909-001507, and 100924-000474.   -- Update on 10/6/2010 --   I've contacted the publisher many times and they opened two tickets for this issue telling me the issue was reported to the Ebook Department. But then nothing happens and their stupid system AUTOMATICALLY closes tickets after two/three days. I'm giving up on this; if they don't correct the formatting, I'll almost certainly not buy this book for my Kindle even though I believe it's a great book.  -- Update 11/15/2011 --  The ebook content is still broken and despite many long phone calls and follow ups with both Amazon and the publisher, it seems to be going nowhere. In fact Amazon told me this was beyond their control and the publisher \\"may\\" fix it \\"if they want\\" and that they have communicated the issue to the publisher through proper channel. I personally think that the publisher is not willing to fix it for reasons I can't figure.   I can only request the authors and Martin Fowler (being the series editor), to take action and work with the publisher to resolve the issues with the Kindle e-book version.  P.S. I'd like to iterate that this is an issue with the e-book version only. The book content is superb just like most books in the series with Martin Fowler's signature.

B001P06GX4|5.0|I bought this game about 2 months ago, and since have played it dozens of times with my two 4 year-old boys (they are very capable of playing well), my husband, and my parents, for whom I purchased their own Blokus. Every game is different, and it's so fun to see my boys' skills progress. Great equalizer, as there are many strategies that can be employed at different levels of abilities. We haven't lost a piece, yet, either. LOVE it! So much more educational and fun than Candyland and other games that are entirely based on luck. Highly recommended.
B003OPUZYY|5.0|I'd really give it 4 1/2 stars.    A great way and value to start a TYA collection or update your old non-remastered CDs.  These 5 LPs represent the absolute peak of TYA.  The sound quality is pretty good and I mostly bought it to get a remaster of \\"A Space In Time\\", which is one of my all-time favorite rock LPs from growing up and not available in the U.S. remastered.    I'd compare my original 1980s Space In Time CD release on Chrysalis or the recent remasters but my \\"good\\" CD player is in the shop right now but I can tell you that it sounds good, even played through my DVD player.  My vinyl is done wore out and is good only for the worn LP cover.  I'm figuring they are at least equivalent or superior to the European remasters released over the last decade.    Speaking of covers, this CD set does provide small thumbnails of the original LP front/back covers but you're mostly \\"SOL\\" on much in the way of liner notes.  Full information including release dates of the LPs are provided in small print and a short liner-note retread from the \\"Ssssh\\" remaster CD by Alvin Lee is provided, along with a short teaser written by a \\"marketing person\\" is on the back cover of the booklet.  You also get the photo of the Woodstock audience that originally appeared in the gatefold of the \\"R&R Music To The World\\" LP.    In some ways, kind of skimpy for the TYA fan or collector.  Here are the shortcomings in my opinion:    Packaging - It's really basic but it'd at least been nice to have the artwork that appeared in the original LP gatefolds like from the \\"Watt\\" and \\"Cricklewood Green\\" LPs/CDs.  Also, the only photo of the band is on the cover of the booklet (the same as on the back of \\"Ssssh\\" LP/CD), so unless you already know who the band members are, that's all you get.  Plus, there's no real history of the band here, so why not include at least the informational essay from the BGO remaster of \\"R&R Music To The World\\" CD by Neil Slaven?  It's concise yet absolutely informative.    Music - Great collection of songs but at the same time, you get slighted a bit for collectors, especially.  The only bonus tracks are edited single versions (*sigh*) of 4 songs, and ONE b-side, an edited version of \\"Love Like A Man\\", which to these ears on comparison, is basically an edited version of the one that appears on the \\"Live At The Fillmore East\\" CD set.  So don't throw out your remastered UK CD of the \\"Cricklewood Green\\" CD if you want the two bonus tracks on it.  They arn't among my favorites of TYA, though.  A real value might have been including the entirety of the Woodstock performance, or other live material since only a smattering of live material appears across the 5 LPs.    If you've already bought all of the remastered 21st century European remasters of these LPs/CDs, it's not very encouraging to purchase this CD set and is not recommended.    If you want to start a great economical collection of TYA, though, buy this set and the \\"Live At the Fillmore East\\" double-CD so you know how they could tear it up live.  Then after that, perhaps the \\"Undead\\" UK EMI CD remaster, then lastly, the UK EMI CD remaster of \\"Cricklewood Green\\" to get the 2 bonus tracks, great photos, and a good informative essay by Ric Lee.  After that, you're on your own.
B000K1P66W|5.0|Every time I purchase this book, I end up giving it away and buying it again.  Depending on when I read it, I get something different out of it; the words of this book are timeless and very meaningful.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|Not going to say too much about this, other than all the listings of features state 5.1 DTS HD-Master Audio. That is a horrible audio track to get stuck with for this kind of money (to most of us it's the 2nd time buying film). At least they could give us PCM audio for those of us that actually have decent theater systems!  'nough said
1401324029|3.0|I love ABC's Castle. I enjoy the interaction between the characters and the mysteries are intriquing enough to keep my sister and I guessing through most of the show.     The Nikki Heat books are enjoyable, the mysteries are puzzling enough to keep me interested and the characters are likeable. And there's always the fun of connecting the characters/events in the book to the TV show.    I had three problems with this book... One, there wasn't enough interaction between Rook and Nikki's team. There was some bad feelings caused by Rook's article, but they were glossed over. I would have liked to have had a bigger fight between Rook and Rayley and Ochoa.    The seond, it was too similar to the first Nikki Heat book in some ways. Some of the suspense in this book was just a repeat of the suspense in the first book.    The third and biggest complaint is that it's a Nikki Heat book, not a Castle novelization. As much fun as the Nikki Heat books are, I would much rather read about Rick Castle and Kate Beckett. My ideal woul be a Castle novelization with a Nikki Heat novella as an epilogue (to show how the \\"real life\\" case inspired Castle.)
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I couldn't wait for the final installment, then couldn't wait for it to be over! I really enjoyed the first two, but Mockingjay left me feeling like the author was grasping for a story. The ending left something to be desired.  I respect authors hard work and creativity, which is why I feel bad for only giving this book 2 stars, but I truly found it a struggle to get through.
B000M341QE|5.0|I have watched this movie probably at least 50 times.  It is awesome in all respects.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a great TV show, which of course means the networks had to cancel it right away. I never actually saw it on TV (I had never even heard of it when it was on TV), but I later saw the movie Serenity, which has the same cast and is based on the same overall story. The movie was great so I went hunting for the TV series and I have not been disappointed. If you've seen the movie, it is basically the Reader's Digest version of the whole story arc, while the Firefly TV series is like a few chapters somewhere near the beginning.    The first season of any TV series is always a little rough around the edges, and so while the same is true for Firefly, I'll also say that it is less so than with most other series I've watched - it's high quality, it feels like there are years of backstory in place, and the crew of the Firefly don't seem awkward together at all - it comes across as if they've been together for years and we're jumping into the middle of their adventures.    The premise of the show (the adventures of outlaws on the frontiers of space) and the decision to unabashedly draw parallels to old Westerns were both pretty big risks because it would be so easy for it to fall apart and become a pretty corny show. Somehow they manage to pull it off though, and the result is a great mix of humor, drama, characters, and story.    The writing is excellent, the production is excellent, and the acting is excellent, so really my only regret as I watch the episodes is knowing that there won't be any more to come.
B00456H5LC|5.0|This album is amazing; it reflects Bruno Mars as a serious artist. I love every song!
0345505387|1.0|I am a devoted fan of Diana but this graphic novel was a complete dud.  It seems like Diana is just trying to make easy money off of a good story line with these short stories/novels.  I was so disappointed with this novel and the cartoons!!! She needs to get back to the series, which I love, and not make us wait 2 to 3 years between books!
B002VECM6S|5.0|Despite criticism from those who would dissect this movie to find faults where there should be none, I loved this story.  It's the true story of a family who accepted a boy of a different color as one of their own and helped him to excel in his sports aptitudes and succeed in his more challenging scholastic endeavors.  Maybe that's over-simplifying it, but it's a great movie nonetheless.  Very heartwarming, especially at the end when you meet the real people.  I'm reminded of the movie Radio, which was also a true story.    Enjoy it as an affirmation that people will continue to do the right thing and give of themselves.
0385732554|5.0|The Giver is a book written for middle school students, but as a 20 year old college student, I enjoyed it as much now as I did in the 7th grade. The writing, first of all, captures you and sucks you into this world in which Jonas and his family and friends live. The concept of the book is so intriguing also that it makes it easy to WANT to read it. Jonas' relationship with The Giver is heartbreaking in good and bad ways. I think that every student should read this as a middle schooler, but I think that everyone should read this book because it is a well written, easy to read book that also makes you think. I enjoyed this book and plan on reading it again and again!
B00332GA8I|1.0|This item requires that you enter a digital rights code that is printed on the package.  With its printing, in my case it was impossible to read.  Item is now nothing more than overpriced USB flash drive.
1439181780|1.0|It amazes me, that after producing \\"The Secret\\" and witholding vital information, this woman is still hammering away and rehasing old information. Rhonda and her crew went to a few Abraham seminars and filmed them. She then approached various other teachers and presented them with the idea of creating a film around Abrahams theory of Law of Attraction. The interesting thing is, THE REAL SECRET WAS NEVER REVEALED IN THE FILM. Rhonda actually edited out all mention of the word \\"Vibration\\" and \\"Source Energy\\". So the REAL SECRET is that we are Source Energy in a physical body. Without that kind of understanding, the Law of Attraction doesn't make any sense. It's like trying to make toast, without plugging into the electricity on the wall. We live in a vibrational Universe, we are more about vibration than we are about flesh, blood and bones. And yet, she leaves this information out, both in the secret and the power. The REAL POWER is that you are GOD. Period! If you want to raise your consciousness, I highly reccommend reading, \\"The Vortex\\" & \\"Ask & it is Given\\" by Abraham. It's the clearest information available on the planet today...because it reminds you of who you really are, and that in order to create anything, you have to hook up with this greater part of you. Rhonda seems to think we can do this on our own. This book is as watered down as \\"The Secret\\". BTW, Law of Attraction was never witheld from the masses, that was a very clever ploy Rhonda and her crew used to attract many to the film.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|A great and epic western.  Good acting, good story line.  The sound is a little \\"difficult\\" at times and generally does not live up to the bluray expectaitons.  However, all in all a great film with many hours of viewing pleasrue.  If you are a western fan, this goes in your collection.
B003H8WSLQ|5.0|The title of my review says it all. Foals are the future of Indie music, and they are my new favorite band. This is a stunning and perfect album.
B000MQC9H4|3.0|This is a really good movie one of my Female friends and i watched this movie so i decided to get this Dvd it is a good romantic movie. i would reccomend this movie to any one who enjoys romantic movies
B002ZG993Q|5.0|There was nothing \\"Hollywood\\" about this movie, and that's why I loved the H*LL out of it...!! We always knew Clooney could act, but the direction and the style of the movie was what kept me interested. Most of today's movies don't know when to SHUT UP (overly needless dialogue) and let the plot do the talking. Same with the usually lousy and inappropriate \\"music\\". This film had NEITHER and it was definitely its strong point. Reminded me very much of an excellent Bronson or McQueen movie, only updated to today's style. This is kind of what James Bond would be if it had been rated \\"R\\". NO, this was defiinitely not an action movie, but there was MORE than enough going on in the plot, if you paid attention (those with no attention spans, hence your 1 star ratings...). I loved it.  P.S. I had to add this in, but the sex scene with Clooney and that sweet Italian girl was UNBELIEVABLE... Talk about ACTING... whew! You'll have to wipe the sweat off your brow after THAT ONE... That scene was probably the reason it could never be a \\"Bond\\" film.
B0040JHNZ2|5.0|i've read a few Follett books, this one is just as good! i was initially put off by all the one star reviews but if you look at them they seem to be complaining about the price. i don't know if amazon has since dropped the price, but it was $12 for me, the same as lots of other kindle books.  It's a good story, and quite informative, like his other books. read the low reviews before making a decision is what i've learnt!
B002ZG98VE|1.0|My husband and I watched this movie on PPV, and it has been a long time since I have been that bored. It was hard to make out what they were saying, and things moved very slowly. I wanted to lol at Maid Marian showing up at the battle, yeah right like that would have happened. If I hadn't known the title of this movie, I wouldn't have known who it was about. I kept wishing for it to end, but it kept dragging on, I assumed it was going to start getting better any second, but it never did. There was really none of the iconic \\"Robbing the Rich to Feed the Poor\\" that we all associate Robin Hood with. I can understand wanting to shake it up a little and give a fresh perspective, but to me it would be like filming Lord of the Rings--with no Ring!! They should have kept the essence of Robin Hood, I think they failed miserably
B001O2ZW1A|4.0|Just want to  say that Steven Wilson is a great great composer, and this álbum is no exception at all. It is darker that all PT álbums, but not for that less . If you like king crimson, you'd like this album
B003XMUFGQ|4.0|When Eric Clapton released Back Home in 2005, he spoke of the record as completing the statement he began with 1989's Journeyman. Five years later, Clapton is back with a new solo record that is more of a reflection on his journeys.<br /><br />The guitar legend hasn't lost sight of the spotlight in the five years since a solo album release; a vast majority of his work over the last few years has been work rekindling old connection.<br /><br />After a short run with Cream in 2005, Clapton went on to work with his old Blind Faith bandmate, Steve Winwood and even one of his own heroes, JJ Cale.<br /><br />For Clapton, a much more diverse spread of talent joins him for some additional reflection. Allen Toussaint, Sheryl Crow, Derek Trucks, and Steve Winwood all accompany Clapton along with many other notable names for one of his most laid back, yet enjoyable records ever.<br /><br />Able to meld cover songs into completely new musical discoveries, Clapton's guitar work is brilliant as usual, but the surrounding piano, trumpet, harmonica, and other less typical instrumentation for a Clapton record is what makes all fourteen tracks a joy to listen to.<br /><br />When an artist truly has a passion for the music he or she creates, the result is always much more inspiring. With Clapton, Eric Clapton is not even close to reaching the technical complexity of his earliest work, but with nothing left to prove, it is obvious he is playing the music he loves with the people he respects. Fans of anything he has released over his long career should give this record a listen.<br /><br />Similar Artists: JJ Cale, B.B. King<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"How Deep Is the Ocean\\"
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I love this boxed set.  I'm not reviewing the show as anyone buying the boxed set probably already knows if they like it or not.  The picture quality is top notch and the box set is attractive and well designed.  Each season is in an individual little \\"book\\" that pulls out of the main box.  Discs are held securely in plastic trays within.  I'm very pleased overall.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|My wife and I loved this movie so much we made sure the entire extended family watched it as well.  Raising a child with Autism can be full of a lot of challenges but it makes the rewards and accomplishments all the sweeter. We laughed and cried our way through this movie, relating to much of it.  I recommend it to everyone, no matter if you are familiar with Autism Spectrum Disorder or not.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  If you enjoy the original Pride and Prejudice, you will enjoy this film.  For the true Pride and Prejudice fan it is like watching a train wreck, everything goes wrong from how it is supposed to be in the story, but it is so crazy you can't stop watching.  Love it.
B003EYVXSW|4.0|Splice was an intense movie.  I loved the plot and the acting was great.  It's safe to say that there will be a second one.
0446569895|4.0|This book is amust for any Ozzy fan. I purchased it for my husband, who really enjoyed it.We had been unable to find the book locally and were very happy to find it on Amazon.
B00003CXB4|1.0|I was very concerned when I opened the DVD package and the DVD case cover graphics looked as if it had just been photocopied.  The DVD started skipping about 15 minutes into the movie and wouldn't play the rest of the movie.  I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED and will not be ordering from Amazon or another seller again.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|defective when arrived - would not allow return or exchange. customer service was nice but beware of the unsaid no-refund policy
1401324029|5.0|I love it.  I can hear Richard Castle's voice when Jameson Rook speaks, and I can see Detective Beckett's mannerisms every time Nikki Heat gets defensive or kicks butt.  It's like I have two Castles. I have the one on TV, and I have the alternate-universe Castle and Beckett in the book - although they go by the names Rook and Heat.  I say alternate-universe because In Naked Heat, the author takes Rook and Heat and sends them down a path that resembles parts of the show, but has enough difference in the storyline that it's very easy to keep the show and the book separated in one's mind.  I'm already looking forward to the next book, with Rook and Heat continuing down the path of their storyline as Castle and Beckett move further down their similar but different path, giving us two versions of Castle to follow.  It feels like Christmas has come early.    If I had picked this up off the shelf, knowing nothing about the tv show, I would have still loved it just as much, and would be looking for more from this author. It has great visual writing, and the dialogue is witty and interesting - much like the show, of course.  There are a lot of characters who walk through the pages of Naked Heat, but they are really easy to keep track of, and it keeps you from figuring all of it out before the end.    You won't go away disappointed, and you'll come away with a couple of interesting extras... like Victoria St Clair.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I had already seen this movie in theaters, but I highly recommend it. It's essential for any zombie fan. The shipment was also very fast.
B000K7UBTI|1.0|This is one of the absolute worst things I have even had the unfortunate experience of sitting through.  With the plethora of high quality animation coming out of Warner Brothers for their DC line, I decided to give some of Marvel's stock a crack.  I found this movie on Ebay for 99 cents (seriously, thats all I paid.) and I still feel as though I was ripped off.  The earlier reviews give a good overall gist of this terrible plot so there is no point in me rehashing.  All I can say is Marvel is extremely lucky the Motion Pictures turned out so well.
B000M58PJ6|3.0|This unit is quite useful as an eq for recording guitars, not only piezo-equipped acoustics but also electrics.  Turn the treble knob down & you'll lose most of the hated piezo \\"quack\\" while still having a decently clear sound.  The adjustable midrange control is also great & useful, and the bass knob is set to a good frequency--usable.  The \\"acoustic mic modeling\\" or whatever it's called is horrible unless you like fuzz acoustic.  Turn the \\"blend\\" to zero, always.  The distortion might not be that apparent at first, but if you listen back to your recording, you'll hear it.  Sounds like a broken amp or bad cable whenever you play hard.  I haven't yet tried it as a direct box so no comment on that.  Since the price is right & it is pretty handy, I'd recommend it.  Eats batteries fast--beware!
B000066C6Z|5.0|I saw this movie years ago, and it was just as funny seeing it again, as it was back then!
0439023513|1.0|I am going to keep this short and sweet.  The first book was really good, the second was not that great, and the third book was horrible.    It is very rare that I simply give up on reading a book.  I have powered through many. But 100 pages into this I just couldn't take it anymore, the plot line fell flat for me and I found myself bored and uninterested.  I felt no connection like I did in the first book to ANY of the characters.  Too bad, I had high hopes.
B003KGBISY|5.0|According to Criterion newsletter, the blu ray of Seven Samurai[[ASIN:B003KGBISY Seven Samurai (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]] will be the longer 207 minute version. Don't believe the 'bad' posts saying anything different. I don't have a copy in my hand to prove the fact, but Criterion newsletter has never let us down before (and who else to know about their own releases than the studio themselves). Lookin' forward to October<br />19th! Will eventually post a blu ray review...so keep a look out! Enjoy...<br /><br />Now after actually watching this blu-ray...it is fantastic! The detail is astonishing!!<br />This movie has never looked better. You can see more detail than what was on the good<br />looking DVD (can't believe this was made in 1954). This blu-ray picture still shows its age, but that doesn't matter. It is still worth the upgrade! The movie is finally on one disc at 207 minutes and the lossless audio is pretty good, too! The supplements are on a disc on their own. Criterion did another brilliant job on this masterpiece!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I watched this series for the first time a couple of weeks ago and absolutely loved it.  I had to go and buy the DVD copy right away.  Since purchasing it I have watched it an additional three times.  I think that the actors in this production were amazing.  There was so much emotion expressed and a great chemistry between the two leads.  Although it isn't as close to the novel as the 1983 version of Jane Eyre, this is by far my favorite interpretation of the novel.
0312263120|3.0|If you are looking for this book to debunk the mystery about decoding, then you should pass.  If you are looking for a fictional tale, with well developed characters and action, then you may enjoy this story.  The plot moves quickly and never became disinteresting.      I just read this book, now 10 years old, and liked it.  The fact that the technology piece is dated now didn't bother me or affect the enjoyment of this story.  This tale is not nearly as dated when compared to another 10 year old story about technology, like Hackers (the movie).
6301792734|5.0|Prompt delivery and great quality.  Arrived undamaged in original shrink wrap packaging.  I hadn't seen all these before and enjoyed discovering them with my boyfriend.  Had also read that the DVD version has been altered but this VHS set provides the ability to see the movie in its original format.  Thanks!
0393072231|3.0|Entertaining and fast read. Excessive focus on Steve Eisman, who I found to be a distasteful character. The book's approach of covering peripheral characters is good but leaves you feeling missing something. The greatest drama being from within the banks (Paulson/Goldman) and places like Magnetar. Lewis's liberal perspective tints the book and causes him to neglect some of the other conflicts of interest that contributed to the crisis. Also he's an industry outsider and does not give credit to the real economic value of securitization.
0440245915|5.0|A Time to Kill was the first novel I read by John Grisham.  It was so great that I began to read his other novels, and to date I have read at least a dozen of his them.  A Time to Kill is an easy read and also educational about the criminal justice system.  A Time to Kill makes the criminal justice system interesting to me, despite the fact that I had no prior interest in it before reading the novel.  I would recommend it to existing Grisham fans, and to those who have yet to become immersed in his writings.  Start with this one!
0439023513|2.0|The writing was muddled, with the plot jumping from one sequence to the next with little transition. Katniss's \\"voice\\" was lost in this book.     I really felt like Collins had a contractual obligation to finish the series, but didn't know what to do with Katniss outside of the arena.     This book was not captivating at all and was a real struggle to read.
006145205X|5.0|I loved this book.  Its well written and very intresting.  Its filled with great ideas and lots of facts and data to support the conslutions.
0312370849|4.0|This novel was an above-average reading experience and begs to made into a film.    Jumping between modern day and 1942, \\"Sarah's Key\\" deals with the highly underpublicized WWII tragedy - the Vel d'Hiv event whereby tens of thousands of French Jews were turned over to the Nazis by French authorities.  Most found their end in a Concentration Camp while very few were able to escape anhilation and tell their story.    10-year-old Sarah is taken with her family and eventually shipped off to a Concentration Camp. She and another young girl escape and are taken in by an elderly French couple on a farm in Orleans.  Sarah demands to be taken back to Paris because she is still holding the key to the hidden bedroom cupboard where she locked her younger brother, Michel, in at the time of their capture by French authorities.  The end result is a tragedy that will haunt both Sarah as well as the French family that has since occupied her former family home.    In modern times, an American-born journalist (Julia)  living in Paris begins a story about the Vel d'Hiv for the 60th Anniversary of the event.  She does not realize the ties her French in-laws have to this event and it turns out that her father-in-law and his family were the ones who moved into Sarah's home after they were exiled in 1942.  The journey of discovery leads Julia to seek out what happened to Sarah --- and what she finds out about this amazing woman will changer her life forever.    A one-sit read that is a true page-turner which will play on your conscience long after the final page has been turned.
B0034G4OVS|3.0|If you let your fears runaway with you a bit then the idea behind Frozen might make for a pretty decent horror film.  Certainly the idea of getting stranded in an harsh environment and being left with few choices if you really wish to survive could make for a film with a ton of tension, but for me this particular film starts to come back towards the original Halloween where rather than being scared by the film I find myself laughing at how stupid the subjects of the film are as they keep making dumb decisions or live with the results of the dumb decision that started the whole plot off.  That's not to say that others would feel that way, it's just my own way of reacting to these types of films where I tend not to find the tension and horror that others do, and really it's why I tend to avoid these types of films.  In rare circumstances I might actually be frightened by a film like this, but really I tend to look more towards comedies, action films, and things like that as I get much more entertainment value from those kinds of films.<br /><br />Personally, I'd recommend renting this one first.  If you really like it, or have friends that you want to share it with, perhaps a purchase would be recommended.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|Honestly, I am not a rewatcher by nature. Don't reread even books I've loved, either. But with Lost, there is just something magical about it that it gets more compelling with each rewatch. It has to do with the timelessness of themes, the complexity of the characters, the writing, acting, directing, music, location -- I am just so happy with this boxed collection. Love the extras and the clever way they are hidden.<br />  Now the nitpick: while it's nice to have a booklet that outlines the episodes, I wish the episode numbers and corresponding names had been printed smack dab on the disks.  If even the disk cover (each season gets a cardboard trifold of disks) would list these it would be much more convenient than having to go find that booklet every time.<br />  Small matter, really. All told I really love Lost and am grateful to have these disks.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|Almost excellent. I don't like hip hop that much, but this album has three gems that made me change my mind about it.   Songs number 9, 10 and 15 make it worth the money.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|'Frozen,' from the director of 'Hatchet,' Adam Green, is nothing like anything he's ever done before - and yet will still keep you glued to the end of your seats, your heart pounding, the ending something you HAVE to behold.    Well, yes, all that is true, but it's also once the main storyline kicks in! My God, that takes some time, trust me. But, when things get moving here hold on, as much as our trio do to their ski-lift chair, for it's gonna be a cold, sometimes bumpy ride!    Shawn Ashmore, Kevin Zegers and Emma Bell star as three friends who take a skiing/snowboarding trip one weekend. They spend most of the day on the bunny hill and right before the place gets ready to close, they convince the chair lift attendant to give them one last ride. Due to an impending storm, and the fact that it's the last ski day of the week, they are allowed one last (quick) ride.    But, on their way up the mountain, they are left stranded in the chair lift with no one around as the operator shuts things down for the night - and the resort too! Quickly frostbite starts to kick in they all have to decide if it's better to stay put up there or should someone jump down to get help?    Whilst up there they chat about the worst case scenarios of death, inclusive of 9-11 when people jumped from the building that were on fire. But, you can easily guess which one will make the heroic jump to the frozen-packed snow below ... and, thereafater can easily guess what will happen to his legs upon hitting the ground!    Not to mention the smell of blood then attracts a hungry pack of wolves and you have yourself the first death of the film! Hey, don't worry, I won't give any more away, but just know that this really is an edge-of-your-seat what-will-happen-next film that will have you rooting for the characters in no time; caring for them, even.    'Frozen' is definitely a great film, with great acting, great direction and above-decent dialogue. And, for those interested in how they did this made-entirely-on-location film, check out the four (4) featurettes. They are SO informative that it's like watching another version of the film you just watched, considering the fourth featuretter goes on for 52 minutes alone!
B001KVZ6LQ|4.0|King Kong - The world's first blockbuster.  An epic for its time, 1933, and still memorable nearly 80 years later.  There's no doubt the movie is a classic, but the question is, how does this Blu Ray release fair to past releases and is it worth the upgrade?<br /><br />Well.. I'm torn.  The BD transfer IS good despite some who claim otherwise, you can tell this explicitly during intimate shots (Ex: not in the jungle) and especially during the opening credits, BUT for those seeking a really glossy high definition experience (example: the comparable [[ASIN:B002VWONB2 Casablanca [Blu-ray]]]) King Kong probably isn't your best bet.  If, however, you're looking to have the best possible release King Kong has ever seen, this is it, for better or worse.  Considering the film's age and that many scenes were inhibited with misty jungle fog and primitive special effects, I have the feeling that the slightly hazy look of the picture isn't going to go away no matter how advanced film restoration has come along. Let me assure you it's not That bad, though.  Some of the reviews are making it to sound like it's unwatchable or messy, and it's really not.  If you've seen the movie before you know it's old and shows its age, but I assure you the DVD release is by far less clear than this BD.  There may not be a jaw-dropping difference like we see all the time with HD releases, but it is significant.<br /><br />Overall, I think you know whether or not you should get this.  For film fanatics, history buffs, King Kong enthusiasts, this is an easy purchase.  Kong is never going to look any younger and for that it's hard to place a price tag. But for the fan with little more than passing interest, eh, you can live without.  Worth renting for sure, but $20+ bucks is a little steep, slice of history or not.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|Extremely bad....does not do justice to the well written book...Natalie Portman was miscast and delivered a terrible performance...but above all else...this movie held such a myopic, soap opera feel of the tudor times and did not have any court intrigue or players such as Wolsey, Duke of Norfolk...it was just like a love triangle, soap opera...terrible!!!
B00003CXCD|5.0|I've always loved Roman Holiday. It makes me smile, laugh, and shed a tear. Audrey Hepburn is beautiful as a princess who wants to see the \\"other\\" side of life in Rome. It's a light and easy to watch movie the whole family can enjoy.
B001EO748M|5.0|Amazing acting, superbly cast characters, rich and developed story line with multiple layers and many characters vying in court for power....Natalie Dormer's portrayal of Anne Boleyn is the best I have seen to date...this season was 95% historically accurrate.,...as opposed to season 1....love it....my favorite movie ever...highly recommend...superbly written and directed

0345479092|5.0|This book gets 5 stars not because its a great book and not because its so exciting, but because it works.  We tried some of the Baby Whisperer techniques and had our baby sleeping through the night at 4 weeks.  That doesn't mean everything the author says is 100% right.  However, many of the techniques we tried worked like a charm.  For all the critics, try it and see if it works.  I am still not sure why so many are vehemently against this.  We all like to have a routine right?  It seems like this book is just intuitive to human nature.

B003EYVXSW|3.0|Splice starts out quite interesting and then just goes downhill...Way down. From the trailer it looked like a thriller! Sadly it is not. I don't want to ruin it for you so I will not list the multiple things I did not like. Adrian Brody was good but the story just gets really really strange and dull. As I wrote, perhaps worth a rental.
0810970686|5.0|He's back and wimpier than ever. Funnier than ever, too. This series is so strange in ways, yet simple, and so very funny.
B003OFHMKO|4.0|Shortly after purchasing the CD, we saw Esperanza live. She performed most of the material from Chamber Music Society, and seeing it in person made it much more interesting to listen to. I think we have a new genre of music here. It's more than just jazz/classical/brazillian. I don't know what to call it, but I like it.
0553805371|2.0|Of Mr. Hawking's great theory of everything. Or of the idea that he's a good writer. So much of this seemed rehashed, then mashed together into something that seemed more a mess than a unifying theory of the universe(s). I can think of so many other books in this genre that I'd recommend above this.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This is somewhat comparable to Deadwood in a very \\"literary\\" script for a historical epic. Yet it's basically a sword and sandal action thriller. The story is very well told, and the actors are excellent. Good direction. One stylistic quirk is the use of cascading red liquid whenever someone is stabbed or slashed. I mean, like, really. Total red all over the place. It may be realistic, but it's very you notice it. It almost becomes a joke after a while. Oh look, they're fighting...scarlet ribbons. But it's a fine series, really.
B000UOGHKS|2.0|Wow. This album displeased me. Usually, I would have an album's taste last for a week, but I couldn't give this one a try. This album was ridiculous, mostly. There are a couple of songs that have decent beats, but I'm a lyricist, and lyric-wise, I need to rebuke this Erotica album. I expected it to be pretty good. One song had good lyrics: \\"Why's It So Hard.\\" That's worth listening to because of its strong reasonableness and persuasive questioning about this phenomena we live in. \\"Bye Bye Baby\\" is for people who are breaking up, and who wants to go out with that heartache, especially if you're not under that condition of considering related departure from somebody? \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" had a good beat, but I need an album to stand out, and this one fleeted my attention despite what the majority rates it on Amazon. Don't buy Madonna's \\"Erotica.\\"
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|I saw this when it came out in the theatres, which is the best way to see it. I must admit, it was a good movie, not nearly as good as the first one, but fitting for a proper sequel. I think the acting as so so, and the implemantation and direction was good. I am sure we will be seeing a 3rd installment of this one and hopefully it will have more character, possibly the storyline with the avengers. Overall though, it was a good movie.
B000NVI1IO|5.0|Ignore the wacky title of this review. That's the first thing I thought of when I \\"heard\\" the song \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" (the though of it). This album is so good. \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" from AC/DC fails to displease its audience and instead gives complete pleasure from track 1 to track 12! Every song has that powerful addicting voice from the band's lead singer. Lyrics are pretty well. I can't debate with them because they usually don't have to do with love, which is what I wanna not hear from a band like this one. If you're a person who listens to lyrics, which you should do, then you'll probably wind up looking the lyrics of the album on the Internet. A couple of songs may give you a bluesy feeling like \\"Meltdown\\" and \\"Can't Stand Still.\\" The thing I like about this album is that it encourages me to yell and rock hard, typical trait of AC/DC persona. This album was definitely underatted and deserves a lot of credit and attention.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|we're into our 1st disc of the 3rd season - after watching season 1 & 2. these guys are so funny! and we love penny.  \\"BAZINGA\\", 'ROCK, PAPER, SCISSOR, LIZARD, & SPOCK! how original is that!? every episode is so hilarious ... can't wait to finish season 3. just love watching the seasons on dvds - need not have to put up with the commercials! this show has to be the best tv comedy so far.  sheldon, leonard, howard and raj are the best TV geeks! and also we just love ALL the t-shirts that sheldon is wearing! wonder where we could get them?
B00008CLOA|5.0|One fine day in March 1973, as a fresh-faced teen I bought my vinyl copy of DSOTM on its release-day from Virgin Records in Liverpool. I still have that vinyl album in its original first-day sleeve, lined up in order (in that anally-retentive way men often have with cataloguing their music collections) between my original vinyl first-day releases of 'Obscured by Clouds' and 'Wish You Were Here.'<br /><br />By the fifth or sixth bar of 'The Great Gig in the Sky' it became obvious that Floyd had produced a more `commercial' mainstream album, more accessible to the mainstream. I even thought people might still be listening to it in 10 years' time - in the far future in 1983 when surely half of us would be actually living in geodetic domes on the dark side of The Moon. I witnessed live performances by the band at the old Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, at Earl's Court and at Knebworth on a beautiful summer evening.<br /><br />Now 37 years later, new generations are still discovering this timeless classic from the pre-internet, pre-PC prog-rock era. If you are one of the small percentage of the global population who have never heard this epic piece and you don't know what all the fuss is about then go buy, rent or borrow the album. If you can't find an original UK Harvest-label CD pressing from the 1980s, listen to a SACD disk on a dedicated SACD player to experience the deep, rich, beautiful sound achieved by Alan Parsons' exemplary production. You'll soon understand why this music has outlasted just about everything else recorded in the 1970s, 80s and 90s (anyone remember 'Punk' from the late 1970s? Anyone listening to it now? No). Listen to the album as a whole, from start to finish, and appreciate the way the tracks seamlessly flow from one to the next as they explore the pressures faced by any self-aware human living in modern society and the ever-present risk of it all driving you nuts.<br /><br />In finding ever-newer generations of appreciative listeners, DSOTM has somehow transcended `rock' and become a kind of classical music. It sounds fresher and more contemporary than most music from the 80s and 90s, which often now sounds dated. It's Pink Floyd at the high point of their long, chequered and mould-breaking career as cerebral, creative, experimental, intelligent originals, full of beautiful melodies, subtlety of light and shade, major-to-minor key changes, inventive use of instrumentation and sound, rich complexity, lyrical and poetic writing, real-life speech samples (Roger Waters' idea, a quirky stroke of genius which works and adds to the album's unique character), and a couple of hit singles thrown in. It's intelligent, serious in theme yet often humorous. The music is absolutely first class and there is not one minute of playing time where it's less than superb: it's the ultimate `concept album', a milestone of excellence; the musical signature of a generation, of its time and yet for all time, and you can listen to it forever.<br /><br />In fact, if you don't have DSOTM in your collection then you're probably not serious about music.

B003MTGW80|4.0|Giulini arrived in Los Angeles in 1978, at the age of 64, but he had already entered his late phase, which was slow, restrained, and wise. He stayed for six seasons, producing recordings for DG and worshipful praise from almost all quarters.  The orchestra itself was not a great one. For a long time there had been a gap between L.A.'s wealth of Hollywood free lances and the generally mediocre local orchestra.  Optimistically Giulini noted that the orchestra, which had much improved under Mehta, was full of young musicians eager to learn more.  Mehta had also given the LAPO an aura of glamour and a healthy recording contract with Decca. DG was not as generous in its output. In this bargain box set we get 6 CDs taped between Nov. 1978 and Nov. 1981 -- presumably the lack of public or more likely financial support led to no more recordings.<br /><br />Up to this point I only knew a handful of the original recordings, my favorites being the Beethoven \\"Eroica\\" and Schumann \\"Rhenish.\\"  Since this is new territory for me, I'll just give my impressions of each disc on first listen.<br /><br />CD 1<br />The liner notes make an apt comparison between Giulini's broad pacing and reading a Victorian novel. If you want an ultra-dynamic or fervent reading of the Eroica, his 1978 version won't satisfy--at 20 min., the first movement is considerably slower than the norm, even for the era before period style sped things up. But there's not a boring note here. Giulini imparts expressivity to this music in such a way that you believe in his viewpoint, which is romantic, inward and personal. The musicians are right in step, and DG's recording has a full, warm bloom about it.  The filler is Schumann's Manfred Over. from 1981, performed convincingly in the same style, aiming for depth rather than dynamic propulsion.<br /><br />CD 2<br />This pairing of the Beethoven Fifth and \\"Pastoral\\" has the same weight as the \\"Eroica\\" -- it dates from a year later -- and although tempos are not extreme, the overall energy level in the Fifth can't be compared to Carlos Kleiber's famous version.  Phrasing is fairly generalized and reflective in mood. the finale bursts with power and grandeur, again at a broad pace a la Klemperer or Furtwangler. the same is true for the \\"Pastoral,\\" which like giulini's other two versions that I know (from London and La Scala) could easily be mistaken for one from a German conductor of the old school. It is saved from Kapellmeister limbo by its careful, at times loving phrasing. If you appreciate Gunter Wand's Beethoven, tis reading will be more appealing than it was to me.<br /><br />CD 3<br />I know of three stereo recordings of the Brahms First by Giulini, all of which follow the same epic contour.  The one with the Vienna Phil. displays more power and virtuosity; the one with the Bavarian Radio SO, which dates from 1979, two years before this L.A. recording, is one for the ages -- noble, strong, tragic in all its dimensions. All of those virtues exist here but in smaller quantity, with less tension and impact.  I'd call tis the least of the three choices.<br /><br />CD 4<br />Buyers may grumble at a 48 min. CD filled with only the Brahms Second, but DG got into the habit of releasing very stingy discs with Giulini, highlighting them as events much of the time. I know of one other version, with the Vienna Phil., which seemed too reflective and inward--it was more like a meditation on the Brahms Second.  The L.A. alternative is no different in its broadness and subdued energy. The finale comes alive with a faster tempo' on both instances you need to be in a Celibidache mood to really tune in.<br /><br />CD 5<br />This disc begins with a Schumann \\"Rhenish\\" from 1979 that I have loved for a long time. It's almost stately, in the manner of Klemperer's Schumann, but with less grit and more tenderness.  The orchestra seems more energized than in Giulini's Beethoven and Brahms, but not by much. They gave him a consistently deep-voiced sound without an emphasis on momentum. I regret using the same adjectives so often; although cut from the same cloth, the conductor did try to make each reading personal. From the same sessions comes a Tchaikovsky \\"Pathetique\\" that plays to strength. I think about it in the same way as I thought about his 1959 recording on EMI with the Philharmonia: Giulinie can't match the incandescence of Mravinsky, the sheer virtuosity of Reiner with the Chicago Sym., or the personal intensity of Bernstein on DG, but his is an ardent, heart-on-sleeve performance that appeals to me far more than, say, Jansons or Pletnev in their cooler, more streamlined approach.  By the time he came to L.A., the interpretation was more reserved but just as personal. You may miss the earlier dash, but in exchange the recorded sound is much better.<br /><br />CD 6<br />This is a French program pairing Debussy (La Mer) and Ravel (Ma Mere l'Oye, Rapsodie espagnole), with the style being as warm and relaxed as everywhere else. But here I find that more magic occurs. Giulini's earlier Ravel and Debussy on EMI, with the first orchestra he made his name with, the Philharmonia, earned much praise. Here in L.A., with considerably better sound, the atmosphere he weaves is more delicate and entrancing.  I would call these the truly memorable items in this collection, worth seeking out on their own, along with the Schumann \\"Rhenish,\\" if you don't want to acquire the entire set.ound without an emphasis on momentum.

B0021L8V1Q|3.0|The video quality is great, but I experienced numerous random audio dropouts on the Blu Ray disk. There are reports on various A/V websites of this (avsforum has several). It appears to affect Blu Ray players from different manufacturers, but the consensus (so far) seems to be it will require firmware updates - the reviewers don't blame the disk mastering at this time.

1439148953|5.0|Eilis Lacey, the protagonist in Colm Toibin's novel \\"Brooklyn\\" is a totally unremarkable girl growing into womanhood surrounded by all too-ordinary family and friends. It is perhaps the ordinariness of Eilis and the things that happen to her that prove author Toibin's mastery of human emotion and the language that endears her to us.<br /><br />Growing up in a small Irish village, her concerns are those of all young women from poor families - she knows very little of the world beyond her small town, her mother, and her more mature and \\"smart\\" older sister. She is lucky to have a job in an upscale food shop ruled by an affected martinet, to benefit from her sister's counsel, and the influence of a friendly parish priest. Indeed, it is Father Flood, a kindly American priest, who jumpstarts her life with the fare for passage to America, a place to live, and a place to work in Brooklyn, USA.<br /><br />These early sectors of the book portray Ms. Lacey as she is, rustic, uneducated, unsophisticated, yet yearning for a better life and the ambition to work hard to pursue an education. Along the way, she falls in love and secretly marries an American-Italian, returns to Ireland to her mother following her sister's death. There, she must choose between a new would-be love and her secret husband in America.<br /><br />Beyond the plot which is superbly worked out, none of it could matter were it not for author Toibin's fine scalpel with the language of character development. His prose is lean - I dare you to look at the book and try to change a single word in a single sentence. And as an Irishman, too, I can hear the hush of soft Irish accent in the dialogue. \\"Brooklyn\\" raises the bar for character development. If you like character-driven novels, this is one you can't afford to miss.
B001O7JHVG|4.0|Tango & Cash is a steriotypical 80s buddy movie.  This is in no way a bad thing, it's an entertaining movie.  It has its cheesy moments, it has its funny moments.  It's definitely worth a purchase (assumably under $20).  I would definitely recommend it.  Just don't go expecting a movie that will be thought provoking or serious at all.    The downside?  It's pretty bare minimum, as quite a few blu-rays from the 80s are becoming (not all, but some) as in you'll get play movie, scene select, setup.  Still if you want an entertaining movie in great picture quality then buy it.
B00005221L|5.0|Viewed: 10/03, 8/04, 7/07, 10/10<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />7/07: As often I've seen Predator, the picture just throws me in a nostalgic mood for old taste of the way action movies used to be. Predator is a hell of a ride, and this is about muscles, guns, blowing up things, intelligent scripting, principles, values, honor, teamwork, an awesome villain, and big muscles. Arnold Schwarzenegger is certainly an irreplaceable actor because everything he does in films like Predator and The Terminator makes him a fluid-like action star. There are huge amounts of muscles throughout the film, starting with Arnold, and then onto Carl Weathers, Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura, and Sonny Landham. Ironically, the last two stars and Arnold himself made runs for state governorships, and two of them have won. How often a film goes by where there could have been three governors in a film that has the idea of a B-movie when in fact is a five-star picture? How often a film like Predator comes out seamlessly perfect? Thousands of films out there have tried to do what Predator achieved and failed miserably. Why is that? Because it is a work of a director with an artistry vision. John McTiernan succeeds in Predator and then takes what he can and applies it to Die Hard. This Predator is an awesome villain, not so much different from the Terminator, and is a unique one as well. Ever since I saw this movie first, I've always considered Predator one of the best action-adventure pictures made, and this still stands strong today. Considering how badly movies have been made today, nothing holds up to the level the same as Predator. One example, a great one, is the difference in facial expressions between Predator and innumerable of so-called action-adventure pictures. Usually, in the latter, characters would have this serious look throughout the time and be stuck with it. I've always found it stupidly unrealistic while I appreciate the honesty and human nature of the looks on the characters. I could actually tell by their looks if something serious was happening, or they just ease down. It is really of a very monumental importance because they aren't machines but humans just like us. So, those men, while packing an awesome amount of firepower and muscles, try to do their jobs as given, and the leader made a conscious task to find the suspicious creature before it gets unleashed into the world of civilizations. While the movie actually starts at the 45th minute, the action is just perfect in Predator, and it's undoubtedly one of the most suspenseful thrillers made. I loved the twenty minute mano a mano ending where I felt bad that Arnold's character got shot and pretty much was worried that he might get spotted before getting killed for sure. Yet the Predator couldn't see him. That's quite astounding. While at that, I loved how the characters were able to convey on what they've learned about their adversary. As I said, the script is excellent, and a few of the lines are very memorable. If it bleeds, we can kill it...I ain't got time to bleed...You're one ugly m**********r. Lastly, not to forget to mention, the special effects featured in the movie is breathtakingly well-crafted. Just brilliant stuff. I've said that The Seven Samurai was way too long and that The Magnificent Seven was a magnificent bore, but Predator is the best of all. I will always return to Predator time after time and just simply enjoy it for hell of a time. Starts out with a simple plot, Predator turns into something else more complex because of one and only one simple twist in the story. That's why it's a real winner. When Dutch gets off the chopper, the hum-vee jeeps driving over the water...that's a nostalgia moment. Even better, how about that moment when Dillon throws his arm to Arnold's and I get to see the huge pumps out of that one? It's a classic. Even so is the huge massacre of the jungle trees. That was, on a scale of one to ten, an eleven.<br /><br />10/10: Predator is the one of thebest sci-fic horror pictures made of any time. The And Then There Were None is sublime, and Predator makes for a far more entertaining flick than The Seven Samurai. I also think it is an underrated flick and is gaining steam as of lately as a respected classic. There is a lot of memorable moments and also liners in Predator that are well-known among fans of the film. That makes Predator a more exciting movie to watch again and again. What I love about it is the subtle diversion of the plot. At first, it was a simple rescue effort but quickly turns to be a much more complicated matter than that. Then, another subtle thing about the film is the usage of brains over brawn. Yeah, nearly all of the characters were loaded with muscles and testosterone, but they got killed too easily regardless. Once they put the clues together and understood what kind of an enemy they were facing against, they came to realize it was a grave situation. That's why they stayed and try to save the world from this alien visitor akin to the situation of John Carpenter's film The Thing. The conclusion becomes inevitable, but intelligence saved the day for the humans. Lastly that I lover about the movie is the blending in of the infrared perspective of the alien visitor. Most films trying that technique would fail badly, but John McTiernan made it to work and allowed the film to be more interesting this way. All in all, Predator is an outstanding picture and is already a classic. I am raising the rating from `9' to `10'.or pictures made of any time.

The rest is self-explanatory.<br />I won't explain any of the new plays in detail, but I'll give you a couple play names so as to build a little intrigue:<br />- \\"The Little Orphan Barney\\"<br />- \\"The Ghost\\"<br />- \\"The Mannequin\\"<br />- \\"The Confused Inheritor\\"<br />- \\"The Ballet Defector\\"<br />- \\"The Vampire\\"<br />- \\"The I Can Land This Plane\\"<br />- \\"The Trojan Lesbian\\"<br />- \\"The Ghost Of Christmas Future\\"<br /><br />It carries much of the same type of humor as 'The Bro Code.' It follows common stereotype assumptions of men and women, leaves little remarks, anecdotes and/or tips at the end of some plays (and in between) and extensively uses sarcasm to make very obvious points. If you're a fan of 'The Bro Code', I highly recommend picking this up. It's creative and smart and I doubt would be offensive or repulsive in any way to anyone. As a matter of fact, I think it appeals just as much to women as it does men, especially those women who have been the target of some ridiculous pick-up scheme (I'm guessing that's somewhere in the range of most to all). After all, they're the \\"victims\\" in this, so to speak. Might as well make light of it.<br /><br />Like the show, 'The Playbook' is well thought out, well executed, and well... just plain quirky.

B003ODL43M|5.0|First off, I will reveal my familiarity with Blind Guardian.  Unlike many others who will attempt to review this album, I have not heard most - or all - of Blind Guardian's albums.  Blind Guardian was my second-ever metal band in 2002 with the album Night At the Opera (2002; band's 3rd most recent album) and a couple of months later picked up Nightfall in Middle Earth (1998; band's 4th most recent).  Now I have this.  I've heard a small handful of cover songs from earlier works and my favorite Blind Guardian song is the colossal And Then There Was Silence.  I listened to the singles off of 2006's A Twist in the Myth when they were first put online, but felt that Blind Guardian did not transition to Nuclear Blast very well.  All said and done, Blind Guardian is \\"familiar\\" to me:  I'm rejoiced to hear Hansi's voice (and actually bought 01011001 because I heard he was on it), I like fantasy metal (see my review on Rhapsody of Fire's The Frozen Tears of Angels), and I'm a sucker for lots of effort going into every second of an album, especially when the album is over an hour (take Heavenly's Dust to Dust - over 70 minutes - for example).      Blind Guardian introduces an orchestra on this, their second album with Nuclear Blast.  It is primarily used in two songs (first and last).  I commend Blind Guardian for this.  I will use Nightwish (my +first+ ever metal band) and their albums Once and Dark Passion Play for examples:  I look at the band's inclusion of an orchestra as the replacing of Tuomas's trademark keyboards.  While most people have a hard time with Dark Passion Play because they can't get over Nightwish firing founding member and vocalist Tarja Turunen, I think it's because Tuomas toned down keyboard inclusion that I feel made Oceanborn and Wishmaster the truly memorable albums they are.  Blind Guardian makes no such sacrifice to their trademark sound, or, if they do, there still are 8 (or 4/5 of the) songs to fall back on.      Blind Guardian is a band of bards.  Of all of the bands in the power metal category I can think of featuring so many lyrics in the lyrics-to-song-length ratio, only Sonata Arctica rivals Blind Guardian.  With so many lyrics in each song, they deserve quite a bit of attention.  Both Blind Guardian and Sonata Arctica are at the bottom of lists of bands you'd expect to hear several minute-and-a-half instrumental intros to songs, minute-and-a-half solos, etc.  With Blind Guardian, I have always felt that the instruments follow the vocals/lyrics.  I would guess that the lyrics are conceived first and then appropriately accompanying music is thought up later.  So, if you have a distaste for the vocals of Hansi Kursch, I'd bet you have no chance at enjoying Blind Guardian.  I also imagine that Sonata Arctica and Blind Guardian must share more of the same bands than most other pairs of power metal bands we could suggest.      Getting more specific on the subject on lyrics, we again do not have the Tolkien-inspired lyrics we had on so many of the early Blind Guardian albums.  We don't have numerous characters (except in The Road of No Release).  We don't have songs that flow into one another.  We don't have sound effects for swords clashing, trekking through forests, entering a wizard's lair, etc.  We +do+ have the Blind Guardian-standard exceptionally complete songs, that is, no song on this album leaves me feeling \\"dang, I wish they had explored this idea further.\\"      Ideas vary.  I wish the lyric book included what each song is based on.  Sacred Worlds is the most macrocosmic song I have heard by Blind Guardian and, recalling comparisons to Sonata Arctica, compares best to The Power of One, their longest song.  I would venture to say that each and every one of the 6 billion-plus people we have on Earth would get something different out of these songs and that each one of them +can+ find something of meaning in these songs.  During my first listen of Sacred Worlds, I said to myself, \\"... um... where is the Blind Guardian sound?\\" but it serves that purpose Nuclear Blast seems to be so fond of of having their bands reaching out to audiences previously ignored.  Valkyries stands out on the album as it is concerned with Vikings unlike any other song on the album (at least that I've noticed so far).  This song definitely makes me stop and ask myself if Blind Guardian forgot that they are not from Scandinavia when they wrote this one.  The aforementioned Road of No Release will appeal to storyteller listener as we have a whopping six characters (all sung by Hansi Kursch).  Ride Into Obsession strikes me as the most aggressive song on the album:  it's chaotic.  This song and the last one both deal with Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time novel series.  In fact, just about all if not all of the songs on the album have roots in literature.  The album ends with Wheel of Time, perhaps the song that encompasses all of what the album presents in its first 9 songs, including the oomph of, say, Tanelorn.  Songs like Wheel of Time are why I got into metal in the first place:  metal bands write ++entire albums++ and not just a hit single that'll start collecting dust in a few months.  How many power metal albums have utterly dominating, climatic epics to close their albums?  *cough* Rhapsody *cough*    Some things about Blind Guardian just leave me wondering.  Why, for instance, in a 25-year career have they only released 9 albums?  Dragon Guardian, for example (and you can see why:  the band must obviously worship BLIND Guardian), released 3 full-lengths in the period between May 15th and August 18th of 2010.  (I have the middle of these 3 albums and it's so fun!)  That's three albums in less than 100 days (total of 6 albums since their formation in 2006).  How the hell...???  But they do it like that over there in Japan, I guess - just look at how fast Galneryus has risen to the international stage.      But I digress.  Blind Guardian (once again, like Sonata Arctica) refuses to give us a bad song.  Sure, some hold my interest less than others, but that is the case on 99% of the albums out there for 99% of the people out there, right?  As it turns out, Curse My Name and Control the Divine are instrumentally two of my snores on the album, but are concerned with John Milton's Paradise Lost - the \\"epic [poem] to end all epics,\\" as it is said, and the poem \\"to justify the ways of God to men,\\" as Milton himself says.  As a student of British literature, I'll tune into these songs despite the mediocre composition of the instruments.  I have yet to confirm my initial reactions, but I think Curse My Name \\"takes place\\" before the fall while Control the Divine\\" could be a number of fixed moments in time where the thousands of devils ask themselves why Satan is the leader of the hellish army as opposed to one of the others present at the council.  Oh well - I'll have this album for plenty of long enough to answer this.      You should too.  Blind Guardian is an essential band in power metal.  Why?  They're innovative:  They play speed metal (not uncommon), but they are bards (uncommon).  Stratovarius is essential; they're innovative:  neoclassical melodic/power metal with the most thought-provoking lyrics I've ever heard.  Gamma Ray/Helloween are essential for their merging comedy/entertainment/cheeriness with a metal sound.  Sonata Arctica are essential for their reaching deep into the listener's emotions.  And so on and so on.  And this album does present us with an orchestra.  I think that we all need to hear these bands when they incorporate an orchestra (even Dimmu without ICS Vortex and Hellhammer) if for nothing else to keep up to speed with what's going on in today's metal world.  Is this the perfect metal album?  Certainly not.  Perfect Blind Guardian album?  Not that either.  A great listen nonetheless?  Sure!  (How about a Blind Guardian + Symphony X project for a 65-minute concept album on something from Ancient Greece?  Like Demons & Wizards?  Well I can dream, can't I?)

B0036TGSIK|4.0|Easy A (Will Gluck, 2010)<br /><br />I usually see movies alone, but every once in a while we do the family-movie thing, which generally limits my choices. It usually takes forever to decide on something when we do this, but sometimes it all ends up working out well. This was one of those times. I had some ideas about Easy A going into it that were as wrong as could be; I saw the name (I'd never seen trailers for it) and assumed it was one of those \\"your classmate dies and everyone gets a good grade\\" kinds of things. No, and thank heaven for that. It is something much different, and a good deal better than any of those (with the arguable exception of The Curve).<br /><br />Olive Penderghast (Zombieland's Emma Stone) is your typical invisible high schooler, noticed only by her best friend Rhiannon (Phil of the Future's Alyson Michalka). Things change when Olive, spinning a very tall tale for Rhiannon in the bathroom as an excuse to get out of a camping trip, is overheard by Marianne (Hairspray's Amanda Bynes), the head of the ultra-Christian contingent of the student body, who starts the rumor mill flying. Olive decides to adopt the \\"if you can't beat 'em\\" attitude and dressing the part (without ever actually doing anything actually, you know, salacious). All is well and good until she confesses the lie to Brandon (Cougar Town's Dan Byrd), the school's only gay teen, who hatches a plan; since Olive is not only straight, but now seen as a tramp, telling people he's been with her could give his image a makeover, too. She agrees to help, but the consequences are much father-reaching than she could ever have anticipated.<br /><br />The synopsis doesn't get you anywhere close to the great cast this movie supports. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson play Olive's parents (Dill and Rosemary, no less), and are the best part about the movie every time they're on the screen. Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow play a husband-and-wife English teacher and guidance counselor at Olive's high school. Cam Gigandet takes a break from doing below-average horror flicks to take a turn as Marianne's boyfriend, a 22-year-old who's repeating senior year for the fourth time. This is good stuff indeed from a casting perspective, but how's the script? It's hard to believe this is Bert Royal's first feature; this is as sharp and as witty as the John Hughes movies Olive idolizes. (The Quizno's guy, and nice product placement there by the by, is as funny as the ball-waxer in Gutterballs, and that's saying something for a guy who has two lines; for the record it's Rawson Thurber, director of The Mysteries of Pittsburgh.)<br /><br />Sure, the movie has its problems. It's a teen comedy John Hughes-style, of course it has its problems. There are a number of times when the script could have gone in very interesting directions and instead chose to go the conventional route (especially where Marianne is concerned; she could have been an interesting character, but instead remains a one-dimensional object of audience ridicule), for example. And when did the clause in Patricia Clarkson's contract that required a nude scene in every movie run out? Someone's got to get that renewed. But for all that, it's smart, it's funny, and you should give it a look. *** ½am Gigandet takes a break from doing below-average horror flicks to take a turn as Marianne's boyfriend, a 22-year-old who's repeating senior year for the fourth time.

B002ZG97VK|5.0|The Owls of Ga'hoole was definitely the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. And it's use of 3D was amazing. I liked the use of 3D in this even better than the 3D in Avatar. It was that good.     When I first saw it on the theater screen I was blown away, even from the first credits. This movie has a depth and \\"realism\\" that truly shows what 3D is capable of, without getting at all gimmicky.     The story is a general coming of age story, of myths and legends and people who still believe. It's about family, and dreams, and all the things that touch us most. The design of the owls was outstanding, giving a natural expressiveness and uniqueness to each owl was a big feat considering how expressionless and similar looking owls actually are. But the subtleties in the expressions in this movie were simply amazing to see, and each owl had it's own distinct character, look, and voice.    The backgrounds were beautifully rendered, but also very real looking. It was that golden mix of a fantasy world that looks real, without losing any of the power and message of the fantasy.     This is a good vs evil story, and the scenery reflects that, from the comfortable, normal, forest home in the beginning, to the dark and sinister mines of the \\"Pure Ones,\\" to the busy and optimistic bustle of the great Tree of Ga'Hoole.     Even the water scenes in this movie were outstanding, and water can be a nightmare to animate, much less when animating feathers, and wet feathers at that.     I agree with the other reviewer who said they need an art book for this movie. Truly, if you see no other movie this year, go see Legend of the Guardians in 3D. This is one of those memories that stays with you forever. One of the GOOD ones.

B003ZJJFKE|5.0|Amazing album! I just can't stop listening. How many virtuosos like Joe reinvent themselves after almost 3 decades of music and still retain their unmistakable style? Listening to JS' music the last 10 years it's easy to appreciate he's gone into a journey searching for different landscapes of sound, he's become more expressive and his music much richer. He has adopted a new fabric of sound during each of the decades he's played in his illustrious career and I'm thrilled to still feel like the first time I heard his playing : like I've gone through a wormhole to a whole new dimension. May Joe keep delighting us with his strange, beautiful music for many years to come.
B0034G4OVS|1.0|I had the misfortune of seeing the premiere of this DVD at a hostel in Belgium.<br /><br />This is one of those dumb 80-minute, crap-concept movies that might appeal to coma victims, brain dead teens, snowboarding losers, and mall rats, but it is ridiculously impossible to accept that these three moronic friends could even manage without tripping or killing themselves from the get go.<br /><br />Three incessantly whining, narcissistic, teenage dummies decide to spend their night roaming around a ski mountain. Yeah, that same old setup.<br /><br />Add the three most incompetent idiots on the planet, the most feeble ski lift chair ever assembled, the most belligerent wolves ever born, the most inexplicably sharp braided steel cable ever manufactured, and what do you get?  A more than flawed survival \\"thriller\\" in the snow.<br /><br />Perhaps I feel this way being a self-taught German Alps climber; the plot, idiotic and full of holes, the characters unlikable and numskulled; I legitimately wished for them all to die.<br /><br />The idea of a pack of \\"blood thirsty\\" wolves on a ski hill, ridiculous.  Wolves in fact hardly ever assault humans unless they are menaced.  They are pack animals that govern their territory from other predators (wolves).  They are more interested in human presence as observers as opposed to man eaters.  The dialogue and tonal shifts were not very convincing.<br /><br />I was unpleasantly rewarded with an inadequate 90 minute snow flick.
B002SQFZ68|2.0|This is a fairly decent concert blu-ray. The picture is beautiful...it really is? The 5.1 audio sound is really disappointing. The balance is terrible. The two channel sound sounds really good and the balance is beautiful, however in the HD age...who is lsitening to their blu-rays this way? That is the one draw back to a live concert that has a really good set list, especially for long time fans.    To me, the biggest disappointment of this blu-ray release is the edited version of the documentary, \\"When We Were Beautiful.\\" I watched this documentary when it aired on Showtime. As it turns out, this is so far the only time I have been able to truly enjoy it and watch it as it was intended to be seen. This is the second Bon Jovi package that I have bought since looking forward to watching it again. Both times, the other release being the Circle Deluxe CD, the documentary has been an edited version of the original piece. It is really irritating that the multi-million dollar machine that is Bon Jovi keeps squeezing money out of me for this subpar version of the documentary. If anyone, like I was, is purchasing this package mainly for the documentary I would really caution you to think before you do so. What should have been a really nice addition to this concert blu-ray really ends up a depressing let down.    Just to be clear:  Concert - 3.5 stars (losses points for the 5.1 audio quality)  Documentary - 1.5 stars (absolutely NO reason to NOT release the authentic version)  Together - 2 stars    I've been a fan all my life and I believe that I am speaking for many...we deserve better.

B0013FDM7E|3.0|Note: This is a remake of the Charlton Heston film, [[ASIN:B000P0J0BU The Omega Man]].<br /><br />In 2009 a researcher develops a genetically modified virus that can cure cancer. Unfortunately, the virus undergoes its own mutations and becomes a lethal killer that wipes out 90% of Earth's population. 1% of the population is immune to the virus, and others, though not completely immune, are not killed, but undergo biological changes into light-hating, carnivorous semi-humans.<br /><br />By 2012 cities are being taken over by wildlife, and the human race is on the brink of extinction.

He lives alone in NYC which was ground zero for the mutated viral outbreak.<br /><br />Smith is free to roam the city by day, but has to barricade himself into his home each night. HIs only companion is his dog. Smith tries trial after trial, and as failure after failure racks up he slowly loses more of his grip on reality.<br /><br />This is a fine thriller, but I have to admit that the movie comes across as part suspense, and part horror, and I don't care for horror films.<br /><br />The movie's premis is engaging, and Smith does a good job pulling off his role. I even liked the ending.<br /><br />All in all this is a pretty good show, but not for kids!

0439023521|5.0|It's a shame this book has been classified as a Young Adult novel, as it is much better written than a lot of books tailored for adults!  Any sci-fi fan would love this story, the parallels between it and our reality TV is way too close for comfort, and the political and social aspects are too familiar as well.  This is a real page-turner, and I look forward to reading the next book in the series.  I only have one complaint - the character names are really silly (Katniss, Gale, and Peeta - the latter of which reminds me of the animal rights organization PETA).  Otherwise, a nice, fresh read for all ages.

B0015D3YX6|4.0|I am satisfied with this release, particularly the alternate mix, which puts the rhythm section in the center, and splits the guitars between left and right channel.  This is a much more \\"contemporary\\" mix, and has both more power and allows the listener to hear how the guitars compliment each other.  However, this remaster isn't really better than the 2001 reissue, on which the sound was exemplary.  I am not necessarily condoning a louder mix, but this is mastered much softer than that release, and seems to lack some of the detail that remaster offered.  It is NOT an audio upgrade of the 2001 remaster!  However, it does offer the remix, and since the original multi-tracks have disappeared, probably forever, this is probably all we will ever get.  If you are really a fan of this album, you will want the alternate mix; it is truly a great listening experience.

B003Y8YXH6|4.0|Aside from the fact that all the Yoko songs suck (the the missing fifth star), which sort of goes without saying, this is a great remix. All of the 70s pop radio reverb on the vocals and chorus effects on the piano and some other cheesy production points are gone, and happily so. At first it's a bit jarring to hear the songs you've heard again and again for years in a different light. But then you begin to hear the beautiful tone of an acoustic piano, of John's voice, of the guitars and drums and everything else, clearly and free from studio magic and it's...better. It is exactly what the title promises: Stripped Down. Free from artifacts of the era that, in my opinion, detract and distract from the performances. We just hear the instruments, the voice, and the songs. Really great and not just for the money: for the music.<br />Note: If you can't hear the difference in production values then it's no big deal. A lot of people don't listen to music that way. But some, like me, do...and the new mixes make a big difference. Seems like Yoko finally did something right musically.
B003UYUR10|1.0|A lot of money went into this production and it DID find its audience among the masses who like eye candy. But frankly this film put me to sleep. Literally. 'Prince of Persia' displays the same faults that so many effects laden movies transfered from other mediums have. Movies such as this may satisfy the crowd that wants to see it's favorite graphic novel or video game on the big screen, but for the rest of us, it is a big bore. The producers no doubt have satisfied its audience but for the rest of us, those who want story, depth of character, and a thoughtful drama, we have to look elsewhere.   'Prince of Persia' makes the mistake that so many of this genre does: The content does not fit the medium. Allow me to explain.    The educated film goer wants more out of the film experience than fast cuts, CGI, flashy visuals, loud audio and pseudo 3D. This works fine for mediums like video games and graphic novels, but film is an altogether different experience. 'Prince of Persia' could have been a good film if the producers developed the property as an addition to the mythos of the Prince of Persia video game universe. It could have been an origins tale like 'Batman Begins', or an historical version like 'Pirates of the Caribbean', or a character driven story like 'Iron Man'. But it wasn't. Disney took the easy way out and gave mass audiences what it was most familiar with - a cinematic video game. A film that will make a lot of money but will be forgotten in time. Not a film that you will go back to years from now. Not a film that will be celebrated as a classic of its genre like 'Superman' or the other films I mentioned here.    As for the film itself, the buffed up Jake Gyllenhaal looks amazingly like the current  graphic depiction of the main character. He does the character justice. By that I mean he acts like a monotone character out of a video game and that is not necessarily a bad thing. Gemma Arterton's portrayal as Tamina is not very good. It is probably not her fault that her character's behavior is inconsistent and that her lines are terrible. Ben Kingsley is a good as always. You just know that he is evil the first time you see him in this film.    The attempt to duplicate the running, jumping, and swinging of the main character of the video game is too  fake CGI to believe. The director tried to duplicate 'parkour', as used the much better films such as Casino Royale' and 'District 13',  but not very successfully.     The ending of the film is confusing and bears the mark of writers who did not know how to logically end the story. But I guess it looks good on the big screen.    Overall, this film deserves a rental and then pass it on the dustbin of what-might-have-been films.
0439023513|2.0|**Spoilers Ahead! Read at your own expense!**  I want to say first that I am a huge fan of the series, and adored the Hunger Games and Catching Fire alike. The Hunger Games pulled me into Katniss's troubled world, and Catching Fire gave me a taste of Collins' incredible story telling and original plot. I give the previous 2 books 5 stars. They were incredible. However, I found this one heartbreakingly disappointing. First off, I want to say that the story was relatively unexpected me. I was anticipating more action, better character development, deep delving into human nature and personalities, a thorough exploration of morality and humanity, a more mentally stable Katniss (she was deranged throughout most of the book!), a better portrayed Gale (as one of the strongest and bravest characters, he deserved more respect. He was treated like a monster), less unnecessary deaths (Boggs? Finnick? PRIM?), a stronger plot. I can summarize it in a couple of sentences: Katniss is almost over the edge the entire book, is forced into the Mockingjay position, she is weak and frail and attempts training, Peeta, rescued from the Capitol, hates Katniss and is crazy and restrained, Katniss goes to the Capitol to knock some heads to kill Snow, and then most of her allies die, and Prim dies, leaving her collapsable and crazed. Next, there is an maddeningly vague explanation that she slowly recovers, though emotionally scarred for life, gets knocked up by Peeta for real, has 2 kids and forgets about Gale altogether.   My response: WTF????  The story was dull and boring at first (like Catching Fire, but at least it made up for it later) and failed to meet my expectations as the story progressed. The other stories had so much substance, this book hardly had any meat on its bones. The lack of Collins' usual wry humor and better character analysis was also a glaring error. Peeta is simply turned insane and is unreachable, and Katniss hardly tried getting him back. Katniss. Another thing. Iwas hurt and confused, way back in Catching Fire, when after leaving Gale for the Quarter Quell, she simply says \\"I'm not going back to him. Might as well flirt with Peeta with the time I have left.\\"   Katniss. You're breaking my restraint to call you a \\"garden utensil\\".... or the thing that rhymes with \\"boar\\"... for now I'll call your shallow attitude as you being a 'tease'. So, since Gale is gone, you just go to Peeta and forget about him? You're right. You are acting like a coward. And being selfish. I thought Katniss was being noble when she said she was unfriendly in the first book, where I found her compassionate and brave. By the 2nd book, my opinion of her was slightly weaning because of her altering attitudes and easy and betraying transfers from Peeta to Gale. (make up your mind already!) Now, I realize that by some point in book 2, she became really unlikable. I still felt sympathy for her dead love ones, but somewhat less for her emotional state.   Gale. Another thing. He is portrayed as heartless and crude. No. No, no, no. Gale, based on previous actions, is noble, self-sacrificing, and brave. AND handsome. He and Katniss are very similar, but he appears more likable to me. Sure, he may be harsh on his enemies, but at least his morals are clear. Katniss is a jumbled-up mess who can't make good decisions anymore. I suppose her reaction to everything was realistic, but I think Collins should have changed the story so we could ultimately see the stronger Everdeen fighting for freedom, justice, and protection of her loved ones. Instead they all die off, leaving her mad. And I can tell that Collins spent a lot of time on the first part of the book, but the ending with Coin's death and the epilogue were rushed. I'm almost sure of it. It was irritating to see so many questions unanswered. And Katniss and Peeta. Collins found her love triangle to difficult to untangle, so she took a shortcut and made Katniss prefer Peeta by relating Gale to Prim's death. I think that Gale should've given a sincere apology, he's not evil, and Katniss should grudgingly forgive him, and have their relationship grow. (Yes, I am Team Gale. But who isn't a sucker for 2 best friends falling in love? No one cares that it's cliche, it's still fitting.)   I did not hate this book in general. Collins is still an amazing write, and her plots are weaved with intricate detail (FOB song reference) and I still partially enjoyed the book: the action scenes, the actually touching or happier scenes, and the unique twists in the plot as well. You should buy it (used. or get it from the library), never leave a series unfinished if you really did like previous ones, those questions hanging around you will never go away. It was good, but failed to meet Collins' standards. And the ending was too blurred. I miss the days of excited anticipation of reading this final book of the trilogy, and now I am sort of wallowing in the hollowness I feel inside... though I'm sure later the highlights of the book I failed to recognize will come to me soon. So, read this book and try to enjoy it (only if you're Delly) but brace yourself for disappointments. I wish I hadn't had so much faith in the 5star reviews.
B002TVQ4GW|5.0|I had no idea what this movie was about.  I didn't hear anything about and it and got it because it sounded interesting.  I was surprised how good the movie was.  The story was well thought out.  The movie's pacing was great.  The actors all made great performances.  I liked going into the movie not know what it was about as the story unfolded so well.  I've recommended this movie to everyone I've talked to.    I'm not sure where the R rating came from as there didn't seem to be overly graphic parts or cursing.  There was no sex and when my 13 year old step daughter gets a chance I will watch it with her.

B003ZJJFKE|2.0|Let me put it in a way that can be easily understood: I grew up with Satch, his music was one of my most predominant 'mentors' as a professional guitarist, musician and producer of music.   So, I say this with no amount of disrespect or animosity: Mr. Satriani, it is time for something new, please.   Everytime a new album comes out, I secretly hope this will be the one that Satch dared to break out of the same old sound and routine.     The reason I'm not buying anymore, is because I expected a new sound, a new feel, a new structure and a daring adventure of an album from Satch five albums ago. This album just does not stand out from the rest of his work.    I believe an artist cannot afford to rest on their laurels and keep on doing the same old thing, without expecting to bore and lose their audience to those who pioneer and evolve.  I hope he breaks through.    Thanks for all the comments folks. Form your own opinion instead of discussing mine.    Regards, Sven GHB
0553805371|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever ready in my life. And believe me, I am a huge fan of philosophy, history and theological readings. I read God Delusion by Dawkins and found myself attracted to this genre of atheist literature. And when I heard that Stephen Hawking had something to say about this, I jumped. Alas, I was wrong.<br /><br />This book is a jumbled mess of historical facts of physics. It only gives you a high level overview of the inventions and discoveries of physics. In the first 2/3rd of the book, the authors don't even pretend to address the problem they have set out to solve. That is, the complex paradigm (or myth, depending on which side you are on) of Creation.<br /><br />I am willing to bet there is hardly any contribution by Stephen Hawking in this book. His name at the top of the book in bold huge fonts is just a marketing gimmick to boost the sales of this book.<br /><br />To the authors, I just have one thing to say. If I wanted to get a refresher course in Physics, and by refresher course I mean whatever was taught to us in the school, I could have just opened up wikipedia. I shouldn't have spent $15 on a book like this.<br /><br />Stay away from this book. Or at least wait till it comes out in paperback. Do not waste money on this.<br /><br />And in the end, I just wish the answer was 42. It is much more credible than this 208 page nonsensical jumble.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|I went out and bought this CD yesterday with high hopes and \\"Stripped Down\\" exceeded my expectations.  The original version of Double Fantasy was a bit over-produced and now many songs sound dated with respect to the over-production.<br /><br />John Lennon was an incredible artist and performer.  Sadly most of his solo material was over-produced by Phil Spector, or in this case Jack Douglas.<br /><br />Here on \\"Stripped Down\\" you can hear John's vocals up-front and very clear.  The additional intros and fade-outs are a joy to listen to.  You really can hear how much John enjoyed recording this album.<br /><br />\\"Double Fantasy\\" included some of Yoko's best performances.  Her stripped down versions of \\"Yes, I'm Your Angel\\" and \\"Beautiful Boys\\" are fantastic.<br /><br />The final two tracks, \\"Every Man Has A Woman\\" and \\"Hard Times Are Over\\" are prizes, as John's backing vocals are brought up front, and as a result these Yoko songs now are close to being duets, with Yoko AND John both singing lead.  Back in 1984, there was a John Lennon-only version of \\"Every Man Has A Woman.\\"  I believe it was released as a flip-side to one of the Milk & Honey singles.  It would have been great if they had included this version as a bonus track.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a top-notch release and I recommend it to all JL fans.
0307474712|3.0|I purchased ONE DAY because I had read a glowing review of the novel in Entertainment Weekly and the premise intrigued me:  each chapter takes place on the same day (July 15) but a year later than the last.  This way, we're treated to an entire span of a couple's history, somewhat in the fashion of my favorite movie of all time, [[ASIN:0679729038 When Harry Met Sally...]]  Unfortunately, the story (and its characters) don't even come close to the onscreen chemistry and snappy dialogue between Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal.<br /><br />I couldn't stand either of the main characters, Dexter or Emma; there was really nothing likeable, personable, or intriguing about either one.  In fact, at times, both were arrogant and/or self-serving.  Over the twenty years or so that their story takes place, we're treated to one of the dullest relationships (with a severe lack of chemistry) that I've ever read/seen.<br /><br />ONE DAY is a great concept, but a very poor delivery.  In fact, in many chapters, the author cheats the reader by using excerpts from letters, diary entries, or flashbacks to other dates/times earlier in the year to tell the story, which gets away from the whole \\"one day\\" premise that differentiated this novel from its peers.<br /><br />The last few chapters redeemed the book a little bit (hence the additional star in the rating).  I appreciated the insight that the author delves into.  Emma realizes what we all come to realize in long relationships:  people mature and while they still have fun, it's a different kind of fun.  \\"Yearning and anguish and passion\\" are \\"replaced by a steady pulse of pleasure and satisfaction and occasional irritation.\\"  \\"Everything had evened out and settled down and life was lived against a general background hum of comfort, satisfaction, and familiarity.\\"  Unfortunately, this insight into aging and human relationships wasn't enough to make me sad or miss the characters when the book finally ended.  Too little, too late.

B003Y8YXH6|5.0|I'm in total agreement with the positive reviews here. The original, sometimes thick overdubs are gone, and it's like hearing a whole new album fresh. Some tracks are longer, unedited versions, which is nice and unexpected. I thank Yoko for letting us hear this updated version. As you get both versions for the same price, you can't complain really. If you prefer the original, cool, it's here. As for me, who's been hearing it that way for 30 years, I will rarely ever listen to the original again.
1592332803|5.0|My goal is to go vegan but I have always been afraid of feeling like I was losing out on some of my favorite treats. I am also interested in learning use healthier ways to cook and bake. I originally picked this book up at the library and ended up renewing until my copy came in the mail. I tried the Pumpkin Spice Bread recipe for a cookout for a special needs teen I work with. I was a bit hurt that at first he was the only one taking a slice (and I know it was to be polite since he knew I baked it and stayed up late the night before doing so). Soon after, I saw more and more people walking by with slices and by the end went through 1 1/2 loaves and left with requests for the recipe. I have also made the chocolate chip cookies from the front cover (without nuts) and they disappeared within a couple days - I got maybe 5 cookies out of the 3 dozen I ended up with.<br /><br />Aside from the delicious recipes that I have already tried and the ones I can't wait to try, this cookbook is fantastic for the vegan converts such as myself who could use a bit of help switching over making sure that I understand what I am doing and why. The first section of the book has information on choosing ingredients and the pros and cons of each (such as the difference between rice milk and soy milk) and throughout the book are more pieces of helpful information as well as fun facts (such as the origin of peanut butter). All in all, an amazing cookbook and sure to see a lot of use - and nobody but me ve know that the mouthwatering treats are vegan.
076781326X|3.0|Attractive musical score, but I think I enjoyed the character of Fagan most of all, particularly his performance of the song \\"I'm Reviewing The Situation.\\"  It was cleverly written and evoked several laughs.  Everyone who likes musicals should find this enjoyable, although it lacks the comfortable humor of My Fair Lady and the development of emotional depth found in Fiddler on the Roof.
B003L1ZWG2|5.0|After viewing Adam Green's noble attempt to recreate the slasher genre of the 80's with Hatchet, I was pleasantly surprised to find out about his new film Frozen.  This movie essentially gives the viewer a harrowing take on the worst case scenario of being stranded on a ski lift, 60 feet above the ground.  The movie slowly builds, which is always a positive for this kind of suspense, and creates enough tension to chill your bones to the lift.  I loved the way the characters in this movie interacted with each other and the realistic way they began to break down over the course of this movie.  I really feel that this movie is one of the best horror/suspense films in the last couple of years because of the way everything from the acting, directing, the locations and the music come together fluidly.  This film does a wonderful job and incorporates the viewers fear for the lives of the characters into the picture.  The extras included on the DVD are excellent because they give a glimpse of how arduous the shoot was and the difficulties they overcame to create this stylish thriller.  Rex Reed gave the film a rather impressive review and as a film buff that is rather interesting because he was one of the original critics to fully support the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Although this movie was given a limited release in theaters I hope that positive word of mouth will create enough buzz to sustain the life of this picture on home video.
0060555661|5.0|Well worth the read. Well written, easy to understand and still very relevant in today's investment climate.
B0016OMFNY|5.0|Back in November 1988, I purchased \\"The Traveling Wilburys Volume 1 cassette. I didn't know what to expect. Man I was really surprised. A Supergroup that's worth the hype. And it all started as a happy accident when George Harrison wanted to record \\"Handle Me With Care\\" with old and new friends. The song was going to be used as a B-Side single but whoever idea it was(probably former ELO member & producer Jeff Lynne)to make a whole record out of it. Lynn may have brought almost everyone together too since he produced Harrison, finished Orbison's soon to be released \\"Mystery Girl\\"(which would be his last) and was putting the finishing touches on Petty's first solo album \\"Full Moon Fever\\". Harrison may had brought Dylan in since they knew each other for years plus Petty tour with him two years before. I remember listening to the tape while I was studied for final exams during my sophomore year in college. When the tape was over, I played it again & said to myself, \\"Well, here's a tape that's full of great songs here, no fillers at all\\". And again give Jeff Lynne credit for balancing each artists talent here. Sadly after a month this CD was released, Roy Orbison past away while the CD received critical acclaim & climbing the charts, reaching No.2 on the charts. A decade later, Harrison past away. After 22 years later, this CD still sound fresh & fun to listened too. I'm glad Rhino/Warner re-released this CD so a new generation can buy & enjoy this classic(I don't understand why Capitol Records turned down re-releasing this gem while buying back the Harrison's master tapes from Warner Brothers Records). The Wilburys is still worth the hype.

B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I just finished listening to the Bruno Mars CD and absolutely love it!  Bruno Mars' music is so different from most of the stuff pounding through the speakers these days.  His music allows you to feel good.  It is one of those CD's that you put in while driving home after a stressful day at work.  It is a toe tapping, finger snapping sensation.  My kids can actually listen to Mars' CD from beginning to end without me saying \\"WHOA, What did they just say?\\"    My 9 year-old actually got me hooked on Bruno Mars when he introduced me to the catchy Billionaire song that he was featured on.  Mars' music reminds of India Irie because his lyrics are honest, well thought out and rythmic.    The only downside I found was that the CD only has 10 songs.  I really would have enjoyed to hear 3 or 4 more.  I played it three times in a row becuase of it was so short.  Overall, I love this CD!  Keep up the good work!
B00364K6YW|5.0|I had the opportunity to catch this version of Pride and Prejudice on MPT's Masterpiece Theater a couple of years ago.  In fact, I had taped the last segment to keep for myself.  It is a beatifully done version - sweeping scenery, great characters (and the actors portraying them) and excellent interpretation of a wonderful story.  I have seen other versions, but find this one to be the best.  I know that it is long movie, but in order to fully understand the characters and why they think and act the way they do, it is well worth watching.  As I said, I first saw it a couple of years ago and when I decided I wanted to purchase this particular version, I was astonished to find that it was made about 15 years ago.  Colin Firth is dashing as Mr. Darcy, Jennifer Ehle is wonderful as Elizabeth \\"Lizzie\\" and Susannah Harker as Jane gives you a real feel for the characters and the time period.  I really love this movie and enjoy it every time I watch it.  You don't really have to watch the entire movie if you don't have the time, just the last 2 episodes makes for good watching, but it will leave you wanting more - so watch the whole movie - it's worth it - AND YES - it's a chick flick but one worth watching.
B000YPUF9W|3.0|The t-virus has spread across the world, turning not only zombies into humans, but every animal species. Alice is leading a nomadic life, searching for the secret bolthole of the Umbrella Corporation. Together with a small band of survivors, she attempts to penetrate the bolthole, where stashes of the anti-virus are held. But inside Project Alice and Project Nemesis are there to stop them. A great improvement over Resident Evil Apocalypse, with a stronger plot and greater social commentary, but it still doesn't rise to the level of the original. Which is a shame; there are many facets that could have been explored further, such as the true reason the t-virus exists, and the humanity of the post-human creatures Umbrella has spawned. Still, it's an enjoyable installment in the Resident Evil series.

0142000655|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  Steinbeck used Genesis and the story of Cain and Abel as a setting for the characters in this novel.  It is amazing the magnitude of abuse a parent can thrust on a child, how a child can endure that abuse, then end up being horribly abused by a spouse who also had no maternal instinct or feelings whatsoever for their children. Her lack of any emotion at all except hate almost makes Cathy inhuman, an evil presence that those around her feel, but can't quite put their finger on what is different about her. All that to say that this novel carries some very difficult subjects.  In smaller amounts, it carries the love and devotion of family.

B003TVMIDO|1.0|I started listening to these 2010 \\"remasters\\" with Plastic Ono Band.  Mind boggling.  10 years after the amazing re-mix work and they go BACKWARDS and re-release the albums sounding like this?  If you are able, all you have to do is listen to say, \\"Hold On\\" that was on the re-mixed version years ago and compare it with the 2010 version.  It's not just a slight difference...  it's NIGHT and DAY.  The 2010 version lacks clarity and depth with even some added hiss!  In the remixed version, John sounds like he's in the room with you.  I just don't understand it.  This whole thing is exactly like the Beatles \\"remastered\\" catalog nightmare.  Those albums at least don't necessarily sound worse than their predecessors.  Shocking I tell you...shocking.  If everyone who buys these new remasters was given the opportunity to compare to the remixes from years ago, they would feel robbed.
0765326353|5.0|First off let me say that the book was a great read, and fantastically written.    It is a massive book and its storyline required thinking throughout to fully comprehend how good the book is. If your looking for a holiday book or reading once every few weeks, this is not the book for you. It's a different story if your a lover of creative worlds, and enjoy thinking about books as you get through them.    I always enjoy books that continue to make me think about them after ive finished reading, and this was no exception. From start to finish the storm (no pun intended) and often connecting characters kept me engaged and interested. It has a very imaginative world and ecology that is probably the most unique ive ever read, and the economy was so well balanced and believable even a slight upset further empowered my interest in what the results would be for everyone.    For your average reader, you may find this book a little over your head. But if you are seriously looking for something to read and enjoy, this is the book for you.
0316098337|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  Very powerful.  I highly recommend this book!!!!!
0545123275|4.0|The Story<br />Gracie was on her tire swing as a child when the wolves came and attacked her. One wolf with yellow eyes saved her from the rest. From that point on that was her wolf. Sam was bitten when he was seven years old. When the weather is warm he is a human, as soon as it gets cold he revert to a wolf. He never understood why Gracie never turned. He is always watching over her as a wolf.  One winter day the town folk decide the wolves are a threat, Sam is shot and he turns human. It should've been impossible for Sam to turn in that weather. Gracie finds Sam shot on her porch, she knows this is her wolf. Together they must fight to keep each other.<br /><br />Thoughts<br /> This was a good YA book. I don't read YA often, but this was an original book. I liked the uniqueness of it. It does end on a cliff hanger, which i don't like. I would read the next one, see where they go from there. I liked all the characters in this book. Gracie is such a good person, she really doesn't have any character development other than maturing a little. Sam has development, he grows up a lot in this book. Together they are inseparable. They make a cute couple, their relationship and love is almost tangible. The only thing I wished was different is the character descriptions... what do people look like. I'm a visual person, without those descriptions it was hard to visualize.
B00005U8EM|4.0|How many days does it take to transform a jerk into a prince of a guy?   How many days does it take for a guy to figure out how to impress his gal?  How many days does it take to go from a newbie piano player to performing Paganini?     About the same, would be the answer from the movie.     Great story of a self-absorbed, self-centered twit (Bill Murray) who lives like the world evolves around him. But when the apple of his eye shows no favorable interest in his attitudes, he is stuck in the same day (2/2; Groundhog Day), every day. Her quote of a Sir Walter Scott poem nails him perfectly!    Is the way out of the cycle to improve himself? A huge task with a great reward - the love of Andie MacDowell.     Another great script by Harold Ramis!
B003LL3NOK|3.0|Forewarned is fore-armed and perhaps that's the best way to view George Romero's latest zombie flick SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD. One always hopes for another classic of the same stature as NIGHT, DAWN, or even DAY OF THE LIVING DEAD but audiences should cut the guy a little slack and realize that no one can give them what they want every time out of the starting gate. I went into this flick expecting something that was absolutely unwatchable, and what I got was a film that (had it been from any other director) would have been regarded as an entertaining, effective horror flick. Romero however suffers from being  judged by other standards. But what of the film? Just some random thoughts there.    In SURVIVAL Romero picks up temporally where DIARY OF THE DEAD left off since the story takes place approximately 6 days after the events depicted in that film. But thematically it harkens back to both NIGHT and LAND OF THE DEAD. At the finale of LAND OF THE DEAD his zombies pull a Garbo,  stalking off into the darkness, wanting nothing more than to be left alone. Unfortunately this raises the question of how they can possibly separate themselves from human beings when they depend upon them for their food source. In SURVIVAL Romero seems to be laying a foundation that will deal with this troublesome matter. But I found the greatest references in this film to be to NOTLD because it was in that seminal film that Romero first presented his human beings as having the potential to  be greater monsters than the zombies who were only fulfilling a new biological imperative to eat their own kind. The human beings on the other hand were engaged in meaningless struggles for equally meaningless power from the first moment that Ben and Harry faced off in that deserted farm house-- Power struggles that actually caused their  deaths. SURVIVAL's entire plot is built around the struggle for power between the patriarchs of two Irish clans on isolated Plum Island, and, as in NOTLD, this struggle forpower causes everything to end tragically--although in the case of SURVIVAL it also serves to set up another potential film.    Romero seems to be saying that while his zombies can evolve, we human beings are doomed to repeat our self-destructive behavior endlessly. If we aren't engaged in power struggles, doggedly determined to prove ourselves right no matter what the cost, then we're sadistic rednecks merrily engaged in torturing the undead just for fun--another recurring theme in his flix that has become magnified over the course of the series.  It seems a very pessimistic view of America (if not the world) but a quick peek at American politics serves to re-enforce that view. Who can forget Rush Limbaugh's statement that he wanted President Obama to fail, especially when you combine that with the Republican party's determination to oppose everything the Democrats propose? It can't help but make me think of Ben and Harry in the farm house surrounded by ravenous zombies. And Harry just has to have it his way.

B003Y8YXEO|3.0|This remastered edition CD is not as good as the engineering done on the beatles 2009 remaster, there still could be some sound improvement. Don't get me wrong these are all outstanding hit songs by Mr. Lennon but unlike the Beatles remaster 2009 CD's where the sound was greatly improved, here listener is left with somewhat little disappointment and guess what... Yoko Ono is the remaster project producer, surprise, surprise... not really. Happy Birthday John and no thanks to Yoko for failing to bring out your work like it deserves to be put out. In a nutshell Great songs, poor sound but we all loved the man, the legend, the Lennon.

0374530718|4.0|The reason I decided to read Sophie's World was to learn about philosophy, and it did the job extremely well.

0374158460|2.0|Jonathan Franzen is highly overrated.  His books are overwrought and overlong.  His characters are not all that interesting and certainly not sympathetic.  I am slogging through this book only because my book group is reading it.

1416589473|4.0|Guild Wars: The Ghosts of Ascalon was an engaging read, and I think that everyone interested in a fantasy world should at least give it a try.  The book is about the world of Tyria hundreds of years after the original Guild Wars video game, and involves the ending of one of the major conflicts of the first game as the objective of the characters in the book.  The book, despite being tied to the MMORPG Guild Wars in storyline, does not require knowledge of the game in order to enjoy.  For those of us who have played the original Guild Wars, there will be many a time where you may get a nice grin on your face, or perhaps a grimace (this happened to me one time in particular, but apparently Arenanet released an update for Guild Wars that includes this stated fact, so It's not a big deal) because of prior lore knowledge.  However, the amount of lore revealed in Guild Wars: The Ghosts of Ascalon is such a large scale that it is a necessary read for players of the game that care for the lore of it, but not so much as to seem flooded with random information as opposed to storyline.  Likewise, this dispensing of information also makes it a great starting point for people who want to learn about a new fantasy world, as it is part of a three-book series, and for people who enjoyed the book and have never played the game before, I suggest picking up the original game or waiting for the new game if one is not a hardcore gamer, as they are making the new game much more like a real, dynamic world that anyone can become immersed in.  There was only one drawback to the book in my opinion, and that is that the author does not put as much detail into scenes as I would like, but it is likely more than enough for the average reader.
B003O85W3A|5.0|I've been listening to Arcade Fire's third album for the last few weeks since I got it and it's an awesome album. I keep finding myself wanting to listen to the songs over and over again. It's definitely a concept album. It's about growing up, having a family and realizing you're not a kid anymore - you've got your own! But you can still relate to the kids because it seems like you were one just yesterday. You can really sense the David Bowie influence and even Bruce Springsteen on the band as well. Highly recommended!
B001FB4W0W|1.0|Dialogue Too vulgar for my taste. And the stories are too different from the original story lines.  Should have read the other negative reviews before buying,  now am regretting buying it.  The F word is repeated so many times in the show, until i think those scriptwriters or whoever writes the dialogue, has either got limited vocab or some other problem.     Also too many sex scenes, even the book also do not have so many sex scenes.   The cast is not memorable, not sure is due to their acting or due to storyline,   Sookie in the show cannot make it.    Sad to say, i enjoyed the books, but not the show.  I like the Sookie in the book.    I finally got thru season 1, but since i already bought season 2,   by hook or by crook i got to finish watching it.  Thou i am not looking forward to watching it, hopefully the language improves in season 2.  Otherwise i do not know how to survive through the multi episodes of dialogues with F word.    In comparison, vampire diaries seems much more elegant.

As they have none of these series.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I have enjoyed Brown's work up until this point.  This book was by no means terrible, but is certainly the weakest installment so far.  Brown's characters no longer have believable conversations. Their questions are set up to disseminate information to the reader and in no way feel natural.  I do enjoy this general style of book but this truly feels like a rush job from Brown.  Too bad it too him a few years to do it....

0399536108|5.0|The Art of Non Conformity is an incredible book. Chris wants you to set the rules for your life, make a difference, have fun doing it, and take full responsibility for your life. The review that follows is an honest assessment of what the book is, and what it isn't.<br /><br />What it is<br />Chris Guillebeau marches to a different beat and designs his life the way he wants it to be. In the first chapter he tells you his goal in writing the book:<br /><br />\\"The mission is to support a full-scale revolution with a simple underlying message: You don't have to live your life the way other people expect you to\\"<br /><br />Chris speaks from the heart, and although the story woven into the book is slow at times, it's very interesting. How can a thirty-something be more than half-way to visiting every country in the world?!<br /><br />I believe in the power of success stories, because then our own definitions for what is possible get redefined instantly (i.e. \\"If he can do it, why can't I?). This book is a great exercise is thinking outside of the box, or more precisely, thinking exactly the opposite from everything you're supposed to think.<br /><br />What seems like the biggest regret of his life, paying $32,000 for graduate school, turns out to be a gift. Throughout the book, Chris details how to get a similar education, make more of an impact, and save a ton of cash. The self proclaimed introvert follows a life path that many people dream of, and takes you on a journey with him into his world. He doesn't suggest foregoing grad school for those who must go for their dream career, but if grad school is just a cherry on top of an undergrad career to \\"pad your resume\\", there are other ways of being successful.<br /><br />The Art of Non Conformity is a manifesto of sorts that will allow you to begin to think like a leader. One of the greatest parts of the book is where Chris talks about building a tribe of dedicated followers. Lady Gaga has them, the Harry Potter Series has them, and so does every successful idea in history. He says that 1000 loyal fans will support all of your dreams financially, which I agree with. One thousand dedicated people focused on one cause can do a lot.<br /><br />There is tremendous power in having so many people completely dedicated to something. But so many of us allow ourselves to be the followers, rather than the leader. And you can be both. Why not be part of a small army somewhere, and lead your own movement at the same time? It's all outlined in this book.<br /><br />What it isn't<br />It reminds me a lot of the Four Hour Work Week, but with a different agenda. While Tim gives the reader specific tools and strategies for building the business that will free your time and give you the mobility you need, The AONC is more of a book designed to get you thinking in terms of mobility and freedom, focusing on building your army, giving back to those in need, and making an impact.<br /><br />To put it simply, someone who thinks in terms of changing the world, as outlined per AONC, will certainly need the tools outlined in a book like 4HWW: [[ASIN:0307465357 The 4-Hour Workweek, Expanded and Updated: Expanded and Updated, With Over 100 New Pages of Cutting-Edge Content.]] The two go hand in hand. There may have been one or two mentions of wordpress, but beyond that there's not much tech-talk in here.<br /><br />The only criticism I have of the book is that the resources for readers new to the web are a bit thin. For those who have been blogging a while, this may be the time to change course, develop your muse through which you will change the world, and get to it. But for novices, it would take at least one or two more books to get to that point. Even a quick and dirty outline of blogging platforms, books to read, people to learn from, and other resources would have been enough. But that's really a small criticism.<br /><br />This is a literary reset button for all those not currently following their dreams. What this book is trying to get at is that your dreams are possible to achieve. Take hold of the reigns and make a difference.<br /><br />Highlights from the Book<br />It's great to see that even a world famous blogger and writer gets scared sometimes. It bridges the gap psychologically between someone who is living an amazing life, and someone who is reading about it at home, when that life seems thousands of miles away.<br /><br />One of the principles Chris talks about is acknowledging that fear is in front of you, and facing it anyways. In chapter 3, he writes:<br /><br />\\"A few things I am currently afraid of:<br />-I'm only on chapter 3. Will I ever finish writing this book?<br />-What if it sucks? What if I get bad reviews? (Or worse, what if no one pays any attention?)<br />-I'm afraid that people will think I am faking it\\"<br /><br />What I am trying to get at is that everyone, even the guy writing the book you are reading, runs into mental roadblocks. Suddenly our excuses don't have as much power. Bust through your doubts and lead your followers to victory.<br />And make no mistake, you will have your own doubts even as you read this book? \\"But he doesn't have X, or I still have to deal with Y.\\"  You get the sense that Chris's biggest goal is leaving a legacy beyond himself. When those sort of dreams are truly important to you, you begin to take the sort of steps that make your life extraordinary, as demonstrated by Chris's impact already.<br /><br />My favorite chapter is called \\"Graduate School vs. the Blogosphere.\\" As you can surmise, he outlines how starting a real life business online is more effective for you and your wallet long term. Because once he understood how to \\"be a good student\\", he excelled. But that didn't improve his chances of success in the real world. It was only his experience as an entrepreneur, writer, and non-conformist that allowed him the chance to make a real impact.<br /><br />He even compares the results from his thesis vs. those of his blog:<br />Feedback from people after working on thesis: \\" (the words) 'Good Job' from 3 people.\\"<br />Feedback from writing for Art of Non Conformity: \\"Thousands of positive comments from all over the world.\\"<br /><br />Chris is very honest in his writing. The best part about this is that he's right. Kind of puts things in perspective, doesn't it?<br /><br />As an aside, I actually ran into a similar situation while in school. I can remember being called to write 20 pages on a big environmental issue after researching the issue and coming up with a solution. Out of the 20 pages, I devoted a half page to say that one solution could be to have a dedicated blog, facebook page, and twitter account dedicated to raising awareness for the issue (this was spring 2009). My teacher wrote in red ink, \\"I don't know what this is supposed to be...\\"<br /><br />Takeaways<br />The Art of Non Conformity is about re-framing your reasons for making a difference. Instead of focusing on \\"what can I get?\\", we should focus on \\"how can I get paid to help as many people as possible and make a difference?\\" And if you don't have an answer, that's ok. As another reviewer on amazon put it,<br />\\"It is a primer that I think anyone who is considering the question \\"What do I do?\\" should read.\\"<br /><br />So how big can you dream? How big of an impact do you want to have in the end? Questions like this lead people towards amazing lives. Some remain unsung heroes, but with today's tools and technologies, everyone has the platform to be un-conventional and lead a life that you design.<br /><br />So what are you \\"not conforming\\" to exactly, once you read this book? Well, a few things.<br />First, other peoples' expectations. No one is going to have as big a dream as you do for your life. Visiting every country in the world by the time you're 35? To say that Chris is not easily persuaded from achieving his goals would be an understatement.<br /><br />Second, gatekeepers. These are the people in the way of what you want. Chris puts it bluntly: they tell you what choices you have, rather than you defining them for yourself. The book give great strategies for handling these obstacles that are inevitably in the way of any major goal. Again, many of these people may not believe that it's possible for you to do what you want to do. But keep going.<br /><br />Lastly, your own expectations. Redefine what's normal.

B000L3CHC0|5.0|This watch is serving as my first transition into the Swiss quartz variety, and I am quite satisfied with my selection.  I've previously owned several Fossil, Kenneth Cole and Skagen watches, which have all performed pretty well, but this one is definitely a cut above.  I feel like quite the grown up when I wear this particular watch and as mentioned by several other reviewers, I feel that it transitions from weekend to workday to business/formal very well.<br />I have about 7 inch wrists, and relatively large hands, so I sometimes have trouble getting watches over my hands that still fit my wrists.  Not an issue with this one, I had 4 links removed and the clasp opens on both sides to give ample room to slide my hand through while still providing a good fit.<br />I have had a bit of trouble getting familiar with the different chronograph functions, but I'm primarily using it for the time/date, so all the other timing functions are just good for show.  I will say that after pushing the timer buttons and watching the big hand count the seconds, it took me a while to be able to reset it back to zero...which may very well have been user error.<br />I'm quite satisfied with this purchase and anticipate this watching lasting for quite a while.<br /><br />2 years later and I'm still in love with this watch!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This is a great read.  It is one of the better books I have read this year and I completely recommend it.  The author does a superb job of creating a child's voice and perspective throughout the story.  I had expected this to falter somewhat as the book went on but it remains true to the characters throughout.  It is very authentic in tone and creates the sense that in fact what is being read is almost a diary.  Do yourself a favor and read this book.
B000YPUF9W|1.0|movie is disappointing, the movie doesnt measure up to the video games    i watched the movie with disgust and slight resentment of a butchered video game,    the movie sucks for the following reasons:  forgettable plot  tired rip off of other films  played out cliche    dont waste your time with resident evil apocalypse, it is a waste of time  stick to the video games like resident evil 4 and 5, they are fun and an entertainment
B002JVWR9U|5.0|\\"The Vampire Diaries\\" has it all.    Battles of good vs. evil that are played out on several levels -- within the main characters themselves, within the vampire community and within the human community of Mystic Falls. You are constantly forced to adjust your reckoning of who is which.    Not one but several Hitchcockian MacGuffins -- magical relics in this case -- that allow a number of mysteries to thread themselves through the season-long story arc.    A detestable, horrible villain who will really get your ire up but who is also the show's Fonzie -- the guy everyone goes to when they're in a jam and they need a helping hand. His name is Damon. He has great one-liners, the cutest dimples on TV and a smile warm enough to melt away that ire.    Sex appeal. Plenty of steamy scenes. Plus, our hero, who becomes more and more of a monster as the season wears on, has one of the all-time great six-packs.    Excellent production values. Watch it on a wide screen with a surround-sound system and you'll feel like your watching a big-budget Hollywood production.    And it's from an over-the-air network, which means 22 episodes of story-telling goodness, rather than eight or 12 like a cable TV series.

B001R4MEYI|3.0|I feel bad that I am having difficulty understanding this album, but I honestly do not get Crack the Skye.  After reading so many positive reviews, I continue to tell myself that I should like this album.  I mean, this is the same band that released Remission, Leviathan and Blood Mountain, which are three very strong albums.  So, what is it about Crack the Skye that everyone seems to be enjoying?  I don't get it.<br /><br />Before I go on, I would like to say that the Czar is a very impressive song.  This album is worth a purchase just for that one track in my opinion.  The structure and progression of The Czar is nothing less than brilliant.  However, I'm just not too excited about the rest of the album.  Crack the Skye has tremendous flow issues.  The album as a whole just doesn't feel right.  I love this band, I love their music, but I do not understand what they were going for with this release.  If people are hungry for progressive metal, look elsewhere.<br /><br />I suppose this album bothers me due to the repeditive nature of almost every song on Crack the Skye.  Many of the songs meander around a bit, chicken plucking towards a build up, which is usually short lived or something I've heard before.  I don't have an issue with repetition in music, Isis is a great example of a band that uses building repetition a lot, with amazing results.  But, the members of Mastodon spend a majority of this album repeating themselves, until you almost want to skip ahead to the next track.  The songs definitely drag on and on more often than not.  Also, there is a strange, frantic, off beat feeling to just about everything on Crack the Skye.  It's just a strange album overall, with a few great moments that quickly fade.<br /><br />Maybe I will finally understand and appreciate this album many months or years from now.  But honestly, for now I'm going to hide Crack the Skye away in my precious cd collection, and let it age a bit before I attempt another listen.  Mastodon is an exciting band, but in a way, I feel as if they pushed too far into new territories with this album.  Crack the Skye has bits and pieces of Mastodon throughout the album, but not enough to keep me interested.  A good progressive album makes you think.  This album just confuses the hell out of me.<br /><br />If you are new to this band, start with Leviathan.  It is gloriously awesome to the maximum.a way, I feel as if they pushed too far into new territories with this album.

B0042MEQVG|3.0|As a Mom, I'm interested in my child's hobbies and have read all of these books beforehand.  I have taken my child and friends of my child to the theater to see all three movies. Although Eclipse is a good movie in the tradition of Twilight (keep that part in mind, as the entire series is not award-winning material that parents would be accustomed to seeing in mature films), it is not the best thus far in the series.  My child and I agree that New Moon, of the three movies already produced, is probably the best-acted of the three films, the best-cgi effects of the three films, BUT also the least-believable.
030745455X|3.0|First, given that I have only read the first of the trilogy, I give high marks to the author for the presentation of the plight of victims of abuse and a very well developed mystery plot.  I find the use of tired old clich&eacute;s of the `military-industrial' villains and the corrupt `wall street' leeches who contribute nothing to the economy to be exceedingly tiresome.  I will read the rest of the series and hope to be more satisfied.

B0044XV3QY|1.0|I will start by explaining I DO NOT OWN THIS VERISION OF THE FILM. I bought the standard copy (without any special extra's). I thought about waiting for this release to buy the movie but I was excited to watch the movie at home. Avatar was an awesome concept but the \\"cool factor\\" of the movie is cut by well over half without 3-D. The plot is preachy and uninspired (watch FurnGully for further proof). Who ever thought 54$ for a blu-ray that is'nt a couple of film's was a good idea is clearly just trying to milk us for every cent they possibly can. Do yourself a favor if you like this movie buy the theatrical edition and dont give in and pay for this verision, it only promotes their greedy reasoning.
B0040Z9H5K|1.0|The original was a good movie. Version 2 didn't engage my attention for more than three seconds.
B003ELNV9Y|5.0|I've heard them all. LIve Led Zeplin, in 1969 at Winterland, Jimmy Hendricks at Oakland Coliseum in 1969, the Rolling Stones at Oakland 1970and '81 oakland, and again at Oakland (I can't remember the year). James Brown at the San Jose Civic Auditorium 1963. Even the Beatles at Candlestick Park in '66. Many trips to the Filmore, Johnny Winter, Janis Joplin, Aretha Franklin, Paul Butterfield Blues Band with Mikael Bloomfield, Cold Blood (Liddia Pence) even some old Chet Atkins. I even saw the beach boys, that's how old I am. I've seen all the best guitar players, and I would bet money, \\"they\\" will ALL say Jeff Beck! No one can \\"make it cry or sing\\" the way Mr. Beck goes about it. The delicate touch, and an endless boundary of control and imagination, as in the WAY.....he goes about it. \\"Jessy Edwin Davis, Jimmy Page, Alvin Lee, Kim Simmons, Jimmy Hendricks, George Harrison and John Lennon, Mike Bloomfield, Johnny Winters, BB King, Albert King, Ted Nugent, on and on.....Jeff is a truly unique playing style is unmatched in my experience as a fan of the best guitar players on the planet. (In the United States and England) I've heard it said, white people \\"can't hear Jimmy,\\" and most of them....have never seen him! I did with Leo Gallego. (God rest his soul) Gary Everts and I went 14 weekends in a row, and never missed a band at the Fillmore West. \\"The Carousel Ballroom.\\" What a ceiling!

B0039TD7PY|5.0|I happened to catch the excellent video of Carole King and James Taylor in their retrospective concert at the Troubadour on my local public broadcasting station recently, and there was no question that I had to buy the CD.  For those of us who loved James Taylor and Carole King from the start, this album is truly a joy.  Every song of theirs you absolutely loved in the 70s is on this album.  Even though James Taylor no longer has a full head of hair, he still has a rich, evocative voice and wonderful skill on the guitar, and Carole King sounds as good as she did, lo, those many years ago. But now she seems warmer, more connected to the audience, and certainly a true and loving friend to James Taylor. These two are the true icons of music from the late 60s and 70s.  No one since can match the artistic style and depth of feelings they have been able to weave in their songs.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this video a few weeks after I purchased and began working out with the Last Chance Workout video by Jillian Michaels. I love this video because it provides a quick (but very intense) workout in 20 minutes. I have tried many other workout videos but have not seen results like I am now seeing. Some of my co-workers have commented that my hips and bottom are slimming down and it is a great inspiration to continue working out as these are the areas I want to target. I alternate between videos to get a varied workout and will probably purchase more of these workout videos once I am able to advance to and comfortably complete each level in the video. Don't be fooled into thinking that these workouts are easy. Jillian really pushes you to your limits, but you can do it if you really want to see results. If you have any previous knee or shoulder injuries, you may experience some discomfort as I have, but I would highly recommend this and other Jillian Michaels videos to anyone who is serious about getting into shape and taking control of their health. Unlike many other workout trainers, Jillian provides an explanation for every move in the workout and how it plays an integral part in the metabolic process. I am very satisfied with my purchase. Forget spending hours at the gym when you can get the same results in half the time.

B003ITZBVS|5.0|I've been a long time fan of DC animated shows/movies since I was a kid.  I liked their mature take on subject matters, as well as that they take the material seriously, breaking the notion that cartoons must be silly.  Still, I wasn't prepared for the surprising level of depth Batman under the red hood took.  It wasn't just the standard comic book, bad guys good guys, action, and some entertainment, it rose a series of questions with moral and philisophical play that you expect in arthouse/indie flicks.  I don't want to go to much into detail, but the issue of right and wrong, killing and leaving alive, and of course what is allowed in revenge are all addressed, and done in a way that isn't entirely one sided.  I was extremely happy with this movie, and highly recomend it to all batman/dc animated fans, and just anyone looking for some depth with their superhero movie.

0312323867|5.0|This was an excellent sequel to Emily Giffin's previous novel, \\"Something Borrowed\\". In the beginning of the story, you start out with a profound disdain for the main character Darcy based on her actions told from the perspective of her best friend Rachel in the previous book, and the new information you find out during the first few chapters that indicates just how misleading and manipulative Darcy really is. As the story continues, you form a bond with Darcy in where she is actually an understandable human being and one that really is soft hearted underneath all of what appears to be her manipulative qualities. Emily Giffin has a way of bringing out one strong emotion in the beginning of the novel, and making you feel completely different at the end of the novel. This is a great read and excellent sequel to the first novel! I recommend you read this book. It all comes together!!!
B003TVMIDO|4.0|\\"Suddenly your 30 and there's so much more to do\\"/\\"Life begins at 40\\"-John Lennon<br /><br />Released as part of the celebration of what would have been John Lennon's 70th birthday, the \\"John Lennon Signature Box\\" gathers the 5 solo studio albums Lennon made between 1970-1975, Lennon's recordings that were exclusive to his singles, John and Yoko's 1980 album \\"Double Fantasy\\", the posthumous release \\"Milk and Honey\\" and a disc of previously unreleased demos/alternate takes from 1970-1971 in a handsomely designed box.<br /><br />Missing from this set are the trio of avant garde albums that Lennon and Ono recorded together prior to 1970--\\"Two Virgins\\", \\"The Wedding Album\\" and \\"Life with the Lions\\". Also missing is \\"Live Peace in Toronto\\" and while we get \\"Double Fantasy\\" we don't get the \\"Double Fantasy Stripped\\" disc which features the album without the overdubs which is a missed opportunity and it SHOULD have been included but both EMI and Ono want you to shell out the extra bucks for that album (which means if you buy this set you'll have two discs with the original \\"Double Fantasy\\" mix).<br /><br />The remastered sound done by the same team that did The Beatles remasters from last year are a marked improvement over the original late 80's CD releases for the first 5 albums. These will sound different from the 2000 reissue of those albums because those were remixes. These are the original mixes that Lennon prepared. The remixes had their merit as well since often the remixing improved the overall clarity of some albums (Particularly \\"Mind Games\\") but they were flawed as they were heavily compressed (which makes things louder and sacrifices the dynamics, i.e., the range between the quietest and loudest moments on an album. It's the dynamics that often give the music it's power for example without the dynamic build up of sound from \\"A Day in the Life\\", the song would lose much of its power). They also suffered from harsh peak limiting which causes digital distortion.<br /><br />For these new remasters the EMI team went back to the original mastertapes, cleaned them up, eliminated any imperfections due to edits and used every device they could to come as close to the sound of the master tapes as possible. The results are better low end, more detailed and powerful bass and drums and improved clarity in the vocals and instrument separation. Noise reduction was used minimally (the overuse of which was a flaw with the U.S. and UK original CDs of these albums particularly for \\"Mind Games\\" and \\"Imagine\\").<br /><br />\\"Double Fantasy\\" and \\"Milk & Honey\\" were NOT worked on by the Abbey Road/EMI team but were remastered by George Marino for this set. While they are an improvement over the 2001 remasters for both albums,I don't think that they show quite as much improvement over the original CD issues of these albums. In a comparison to both \\"DF\\" and \\"M&H\\" 2001 editions and these, the ones included here don't sound signficantly different--not quite as loud perhaps but not Marino's best work either. Both suffer from hard limiting and compression and do not sound as good as the EMI/Abbey Road work done on the first five albums and singles on the first bonus disc.<br /><br />The downside is that the bonus tracks that were included on the 2000 remixes aren't always here and none of them are attached to the original disc (some may prefer these that way although I don't since some of the bonus track editions were a bit odd to me). Some of the songs (such as some of the singles like \\"Power to the People\\") are included on the two disc singles/demos disc included here. The 13 previously unreleased tracks on the second bonus disc are quite good some of which are radically different arrangements (\\"I Don't Want to Be a Soldier\\"), some subtly so (\\"Mother\\" with guitar on the track as well as piano, drums and bass)and the veresion of \\"Serve Yourself\\" is superior to the one on the \\"Lennon Anthology\\" in my opinion. While \\"India\\" and the demo for \\"Nobody ToldMe\\" are quite good as well. I do wish that the unfinished \\"Now and Then\\" (which the rest of The Beatles briefly thought about completing for the \\"Anthology\\" series)had been included.<br /><br />The packaging is quite nice and includes a booklet with an essay, reproductions of original artwork and lyric sheets about Lennon, brief essays by Yoko, Julian Lennon and Sean Lennon. There's also a card for internet content included as well and a lithograph which is in a drawer at the bottom of the box. The CDs themselves are housed (without protective sleeves I might add--which is a negative given how much you may pay for this set)cardboard sleeves similar in design to The Beatles remasters. The drawer is not the best idea as the lithograph can easily become stuck and, quite frankly, it seems unnecessary and silly as the litho will fit on top of the CDs in the box proper.<br /><br />The booklets are quite nice and include an essay on the making of the album as well as the original lyrics (except for \\"Rock 'n' Roll\\")and credits.<br /><br />Bottom line: Will you like this set? If you prefer the remixes probably not but, if you want Lennon's original album mixes restored and presented with top notch sound and attention to detail, you will. The \\"bonus disc\\" with the demos/alternate takes aren't essential but they are nice to have and compliment the \\"Lennon Anthology\\" from a decade ago.<br /><br />These sound exceptional although, like most remasters, there are some flaws one could nitpick about. These reissues beat the original CD issues of the original mixes. Overall this is a nice set and would make an excellent gift for Lennon/Beatles fans particularly the latter who enjoyed the Beatles remasters.<br /><br />It's sad that we'll never know what Lennon had to say about being 70.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|This is an excellent pair of headphones for the money. I have used them on many sound recording jobs without a problem. They are light on the head and give true sound reproduction and at the same time allow you to hear the voice of the director behind you.

B00181YT9S|5.0|Behringer makes good speakers, these are very linear for the size and well designed for good bass response.  I thought about dinging it one star just because they are a tad underpowered with 10W per speaker (20 total) but they have enough headroom for their size as pc speakers or digital mixer speakers that I did not.  SELDOM do I ever need 20W at my mixing workstation but it's nice to have headroom, which these do have.  It's just that they want so much more money (1.5x) for the 40W total / 20W per channel version of the same speaker.  They should drop the 10Wpch and just make the 20Wpch which would be an excellent product.  Still, getting this ability for less than a benjamin is a great pricepoint.<br /><br />The advantages are that these work well with all digital systems - I am moving to all digital workflow now and these speakers take optical or coax directly to the speaker, which is a great benefit.  On the coax digital you can use a video distribution amplifier to make multiple coppies of a coax digital signal to feed several devices from one digital source.<br /><br />I use 24 bit / 96 khz most of the time but the speakers are rated to 24 bit/ 192 khz and autorange the digital input, so things just work no matter what you are sending to the speakers.<br /><br />If you are not all digital yet, they feature a full compliment of analog inputs so you can buy these today for your analog mixer and when you move to digital your speakers won't need to change.<br /><br />For flexibility - 5 stars<br />For value - 5 stars<br />For audio output only - 4 stars<br />For ease of connectivity - 5 stars<br /><br />In summary - its a 5 star product at 99 bucks<br /><br />In all honesty you don't need more than 10 watts at a mixing board - save the kilowatt amps for the house speaker systems - hopefully someday we will run optical cable to our house amplified speakers and connect them digitally from the mixer.<br /><br />I would recommend you measure the power in watts you use at your workstation today and decide on the 20W total or 40w total version of this when going all digital.  That way you do not underbuy power.  Keep in mind that both designs have ample headroom on the amplifier.version of this when going all digital.  That way you do not underbuy power.

B003UERZ88|2.0|Discovering Heavy Metal in 1980 when I was 15 and as one of the biggest Judas Priest fans on the planet I snatched this album up, first day buyer. Listening to it first time through I couldn't believe what I was hearing..was this album rushed or what? Rob has done so much better than this. He's written some cheese for lyrics in the past but overall He's been brilliant. Not here. Where's the intricate drum patterns and crushing riffs? Not here. Made Of Metal, The Mower and Hell Razor are the ONLY songs on this I could listen to all of the way through. Later I went back through and listened to them a little bit more. BORING. Matter of factly The Mower is pure genius and doesn't fit in with the rest of the album. Crucible blows this out of the water. I'll just have to wait for the next Priest album I guess.
B000JPIB8Y|5.0|I thought this book was really creatively written.  A good many tears shed while reading but it was good.
B003OT4LZY|5.0|I really like this album. At first listen, I first thought this was a Christian record and that I was at a church sermon with Richard Ashcroft singing for the church band! After a few listens it grew on me because but the music is excellent. This is a very positive, uplifting record and each song has a great message. His voice sounds great and No ID has done an excellent job on production. This is a must have for any RA/Verve fan.

B003K16NO8|5.0|I have used aperture since its creation, but never knew of all the rich and great features of the program. With Aperture 3 I decided to get a book. I really like the kindle version. I can sit at my computer with my IPad and follow the lessons easily. I have never been a big fan of doing lessons with photos provided for the lesson. I would rather use my own photos,  which in some instances I did and there was no problem with following along. The book is well laid out showing you how the screen should look on your computer which made me feel that I was not getting lost. Aperture has so many rich features beyond what I was using and this book opened them all.
B0043CO7WI|2.0|Die-hard Maroon 5 fans are going to absolutely love this album.<br /><br />But everyone else can walk away knowing this is almost exactly the same as the last album, It Won't Be Soon Before Long.<br /><br />Hands All Over is another helping of Maroon 5's boring take on power-pop, filled with the same chord progressions, the same sounds, the same Levine oo-oo-ooohs, the same clich&eacute;d, boring, lyrics about a different one-dimensional woman each track.<br /><br />If this were the first album from a new band, I'd say it was \\"promising.\\"  But this is the third studio release from an artist that has been in the national spotlight, getting Clear Channel plays daily, for eight years now.  And more of the same just isn't enough.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|tried to read but gave up...first book I deleted from my Kindle. What or who said this is good must be nuts.
0743277708|5.0|I love this book!  This epic is like The Lord of the Rings with rabbits!  There is great emotion and danger within the pages of this novel and one will become immersed with the language and imagery and will find it difficult to leave it to return to the real world.  This is what Tolkien's work always did to me and I was happily surprised when Richard Adams was able to do the same thing with Watership Down.  The book read quickly and I loved every minute of the experience.  I was sad to see the story end and I highly suggest anyone who loves epics to do themselves a favor and read this book.
0385737424|5.0|'When you reach me' is a story of twelve year old Miranda who lives in New York City with her single mother. It starts with a postcard congratulating her mom's acceptance as a contestant on The 20,000 Pyramid, a game show, Miranda receiving a strange note and losing her best friend and ends with a satisfying twist. I loved this book. Throughout it, we know that unnatural is happening, but it is so much on the fringes you are not sure what it is. A good twist of mystery making you want more. Once I got to the last fifty pages I couldn't put it down despite the fact it was one o'clock in the morning and I had class that day.   It had good character development and dealt with a lot of emotions without being in your face about them. It is not a single mom, fatherless daughter struggle story, but it touches that idea enough to make it real. The writing style is fun and detail oriented, but straight forward, very easy to read. I only wish there were better references to when things were happening. All in all I thought this was a great book.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|I'm quite adament if you havent herd this or seen the concert you are missing something special and in blue-ray superb mind you the DVD is very crisp and what audio yes 5 stars +
B003HARV3Y|5.0|I bought this for the grandkids, but I always preview any movie before they see it.  So my hubby, and I, gathered our popcorn and pop and settled in for a ride.  And a ride we got!  It really was fun... exciting... entertaining.  It kept both of us on the edge of our seats until the end.  I know the kids will like it, too.  It's definitely perfect for a sequel, so hope one happens.  Will get it, too, if ones does appear.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is a great CD. I really enjoy listening to Michael Buble'.  He has such a smooth sound
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Omg this dvd rocked... I still cant stop laughing hahaha.... This show is awesome and it seems to me every episode gets better and better.... If you havnt watched this show yet, def watch it you will laugh your A%* off... if your wanting to get it def do it... you will love it
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love this CD.  For the price its great.  I will be adding to my collection of Norah Jones music.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Great movie.... For familys, I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND THIS MOVIE, a must watch..... Its a feel good movie of the year
0061537969|5.0|I read every day and I have read thousands of books but none has ever touched me quite like this one.  Bravo to the author.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|This is going to be short and sweet. I will not go into the content or story of LOST, as anyone wanting to shell out the cash for this excellent collection has probably already seen the series or is familiar with the premise by reference.     What I will delve into is the quality of the packaging, the presentation, and the excellent blu-ray picture and audio quality. The packaging was solid, looks great on top of my media shelf, and appears that it will be able to withstand the test of time. The presentation is excellent, and while I prefer plastic blu-ray shells; It would be quite a huge space taker if these discs were not stored in booklet style packaging. In the end, it doesn't matter if you keep it stored in the box, as they fit perfectly within the box without too much trouble in getting them out. Lastly, the picture and audio are some of the best in my blu-ray collection. I am simply amazed at the mastering done to bring these over to blu-ray. Audio is spot on, and Video is far better than any other series blu-rays that I have personally owned or seen on blu-ray to date.
B001VLBDD0|5.0|i loved terminator 2. The only problem I had was the language, to much. I just love the story, specially the relationship between the terminator and the boy. It made me cry when he had to say goodbye and then they embrace. I mean look at that. Like, Sarah said, \\"If a machine can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too\\". 5-stars. The cast is great. Good job, James Cameron.
B003TVMIDO|5.0|because the sound is perfect, these aren't loudness war masters. the remixes from 2000 were loudness war mastered. the same care has been put into not overcompressing and loudness waring these remasters as had been with the beatles boxsets last year.
B003PGNBNY|3.0|Let me go on record to say, The soundtrack, ten times better than the first one. Great job on that. Loved, It's on my personal favorite, can't back down, walking in my shoes, tear it down, different summers, fire, brand new day,etc. Sadly has the story itself not as good, demi lovato was great. Much more bolder, stronger & confident than the first. But the dialogue was not strong enough. but as soon a song comes on it gets you off your seat. Like I said, music 5 stars. Acting 3.
B003W5C0VM|5.0|The best concernt movie made by far the best rock and roll band in the world.  Classic Stones doing the music from arguably one of their best albums.   Saw this when it came out in 1974 (I think at the Ziegfield in NYC) and made my roommate a Stones fan.  I am so thrilled that it is coming to DVD and that there are now screens large enough to show their greatness.
B003YOMNCM|2.0|Why is it that most of the violinists out there are so cookie cutter and boring AND still capture the audience's attention?  I listened to the Tchaikovsky and couldn't believe how Ms.Hahn decided not to follow any of the markings and play it straight on like  she was brushing her teeth. Boring beyond belief and not even faithful to Tchaikovsky. You can still make an old war horse sound fresh  and exciting and her sound was like a little brittle old lady.....
B003EY7IUY|3.0|This book is just not as well written as the others. In past books, I alsways liked and rooted for Becky, even though she was over the top-but I never really understood why she did anything-why was the party so important to her that she was willing to risk so much? She was alway over dramatic, but this was too unrealistic to believe. It was harder to like her in this book. It was still a somewhat fun read-and I kept with it-but it was not as good as the others.
B000VLE3GA|4.0|Stacie L I have no credit so my empyer let me use her's    I loved the duoble CD it had songs I never heard before,I just wanted to make sure it had  the song I wanted, It had so much more, song I came to like some I skiped over, I final got the answer why the band spilt well Joh bohtom wrote about 40-50% of their songs. I recomend anyone who isn't a big fan take a listen you will become one.
B002ZG99CC|1.0|This movie was so bad compared to the original, that as soon as I saw the remake, I had to watch the original again just to get the remake out of my head! This movie cant hold a candle to the original. It fails to have the magic that the original classic had.
0316069485|2.0|Not recommended. Much as I like Michael Connelly's books, this is one of his least successful efforts. Bosch and Haller together are less than either alone. Supporting figures are for the most part either lifeless or falsely animated when the scene requires them to be active or engaged. The ex-wives, children and half-brothers never come together in a credible mix. The whole thing comes across as formulaic and programmatic, almost as if Connelly set himself the challenge of taking all the major surviving characters from previous Bosch and Haller novels and layering them into a single tale; the attempt gets a B for effort and D for achievement. It doesn't help that the bad guy is too one-dimensional to be of more than passing interest, and the did-he-or-didn't-he premise of the tale is never given a chance to be more than the anchor position in a battle of strategies. His defense attorney gets at least two dimensions, which is still not enough. Nobody gets three, but a judge, an emotionally damaged witness and the leader of a surveillance operation come closer than the others.     Let me offer special condemnation of the author's jarring use of both first person and third person narrative styles to keep the Haller and Bosch narratives separate. There's a reason beginning writers are encouraged not to do this.    No reason to keep beating a dead horse. I see the first dozen reviewers think more highly of this effort than I do. I'm glad they got a book they liked. I'll hope for more from the next one.
1881273873|5.0|I have purchased this book, and given it away to at least 5 people. It is easy to read, and makes very good sense. I have even given to men I have dated. Learned a lot from the book not only about romantic relationships, but those with my kids, co-workers & friends. I highly recommend this book.
006621131X|5.0|A must read for anyone who has followed the work and art of Patti Smith or of any artist at any time. This is a tale of love, of loyalties and of the heart of creation. Including snippets of the history of the art world in NYC during the late 60s and moving into the punk era, the voice is distinctly that of Patti Smith who tells her own very personal story in the context of a living phenomenon.
B001UV4XFQ|4.0|All I will say is this...Kristen Stewart is NOT only the worse actress on the face of the Earth, she is horrible, just horrible in this role (for all 3 sagas)  I still believe Jacob and Edward should go off together and make vampire-wolf babies (if that is possible)
B003XU75QG|5.0|I was surprised how good this was, the bad is awesome and Momsen can sing!  Love it!
B002ZG98VE|3.0|I don't know how to put my finger on it, but something about this film seems very familiar.  Maybe that's why I didn't find it all that interesting.  Russell Crowe did his usual fine job, as did Cate Blanchett, Max von Sydow and the others, and Scott's direction was fine.  I just kept thinking I was watching an amalgam of other films, like Braveheart.    The production design and locations were good.   I don't know what else to say.  It's okay, and that's it.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Insight into the world of autism, written by an amazing young woman who lives within that world.  She is courageous and determined to express herself and her connection with animals.  Heartfelt and hilarious at times.  It's  no wonder this movie received rave reviews and several Emmys.
0394900189|5.0|I've always loved this book. I'm taking it to my grandson's pre-K class to read and donate to his school's library.
B003TXKSWK|2.0|I was so looking forward to this release. I am a huge Roots fan ( have everything they've done) and I like J. Legend too.  Covers of classics never bothered me if they are done well, but this was such a letdown.  I waited on pins and needles and the ONLY standouts in my opinion are \\"I Cant Write Left-handed\\" and \\"Wholy Holy\\".     The arrangements are just drab and very slow. Everything does have a monotonous feel. John Legend is definitely a vocal talent, but this was not a good expression of his skills. Regardless of the intended theme of the album its still overall, a poor selections of songs and honestly, just plain ol' boring.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|A lot of exploration of the humanity of the Winchesters this season.  It's interesting how the roles of Sam and Dean have slowly reversed.  Dean the sensitive one?  It makes sense, I think he is slowly beginning to understand the normalcy he missed growing up and wants to capture that feeling before the end of the world. Love the finale and how Sam's drinking demon blood is now a good thing.  Also liked the humanization of Castille,  I think the show is good to make you think about your own humanity and faith.  We have had some serious theological discussions after watching an episode.
0525951652|1.0|As a regular custumer of Amazon and Kindle owner I feel deceived. How can it be that the printed book cost less than the electronic version. Shame on you.
0061433047|5.0|This is Sir Terry at his absolute finest. This book is wonderful for young adults, but tackles some adult issues (prejudice, death), in a competent, understandable way, much like JK rowling does. (And yes, I know Terry came first, but more people are familiar with Harry Potter than Discworld!) I have been reading the Tiffany Aching novels since they first came out, and I can almost see how she's turned into a young woman. It's fabulous watching her grow. I would suggest reading the other Tiffany books first to get context, but even if you don't, this is a very good stand-alone novel.
0525951652|5.0|This book is not for everyone.<br /><br />It's involved and somewhat wordy. History buffs would argue with some of the events portrayed, however, I try not to be too judgemental about 'exact'facts.<br /><br />Follet's research is impeccable. I am still amazed how he was able to weave events, people, situations, etc. into this fine work of fiction.  I couldn't wait to read every evening. I felt a part of the characters in Giants.<br /><br />Some would say it's too long. It may be a little, but I knew this going in was never bothered.<br /><br />Thanks Ken, for writing this fine peice of literature. I look forward to reading your next book in this series.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|Dawkins has a great writing style and his arguments are crystal clear.  A good example of clear thinking by making hypothesis a then giving proofs for them.  But most of all, it shows his passion for the scientific method, which I think is the may lesson of the book: don't believe, be skeptic, that's what science is.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|So many reviews were written on this truly excellent movie that I will only add a few words. The movie explores many things, one of which is the pressures that can be placed upon a person, pressures that force a woman to allow herself to be raped and that force her, as the protagonist in George Orwell's 1984, to give up what she loves. It addresses also how she reacts when there are two loves in conflict with one another. It shows the depravity of men and how some try to destroy others to get what they wants, a woman and a higher level job. And it shows how two men can be good: one sacrificing his life for another and one showing his gratitute in the best way that he can.
B001AYOKYM|5.0|Philip Pullman does not underestimate his reader. His Dark Materials is one of those few fantasy series that is actually completely worthy of the adjective \\"epic.\\" Zeppelins, witches, and talking polar bears are just the colorful trappings of these thoughtful, fun, and refreshingly unique books. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a young adult series by an author who doesn't think \\"young adult fiction\\" translates to \\"dumbed down fiction.\\"
B002P93VGO|4.0|The combo pack of this movie arrived promptly and all three discs worked and played fine. 4 stars.    Thank you.    Have a nice day.
1419802356|5.0|A truly touching and endearing account of a Jewish young man in search of his family's roots in USSR after WWII.
B0021L8V1Q|2.0|After how fresh and fun the original Iron Man was, I was dismayed to find that its sequel, Iron Man 2, was the textbook example of how NOT to make a sequel, and worst of all, the movie commits the cardinal sin of any would be blockbuster. Its boring.    Feeling more like a set up to a potential Avengers movie than a proper sequel, Iron Man 2 fumbles its incoherent storyline from beginning to end. Scenes are thrown together with neither rhyme nor reason, many of them could be cut and mean absolutely nothing to the entire film. At no point does it ever feel like anything is at stake, and one of the primary factors that results in that feeling is the absolutely awful villain, played here by Mickey Rourke, who gets the chance to shine during an action sequence at a race track, well publicized in the adverts, but afterwards, is essentially sidelined only to  briefly re-appear when convenient. The film also resorts to the worst possible way for a sequel to \\"top\\" the original. You liked the fight against 1 robot suit in Iron Man? Well here are fights with dozens of robot suits! Not only is the set-up of the action uninspired, but so is the execution. The action is lifeless, boring, unexciting, and by the end it amounts to nothing more than little dots flying in the sky and random lazers coming from various directions. Iron Man 2 is the posterboy for bad sequels. Its not as horrific as Spider-Man 3, but it is without a doubt a poor film in almost every area. I wish I could say that by the end of the film, at least Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of Tony Stark keeps the film feeling fresh, but no, even that ends up rote thanks to the dilution of the original character whose well known battles with alcohol have been a staple of Iron Man stories, and yet here are played for laughs. For shame.    The Iron Man 2 blu-ray however features excellent audio and video, and contains a decent enough set of special features, but I can't recommend the movie in good conscience.
B003UERZ88|5.0|REVIEW FOR ROB HALFORD'S FANS...<br /><br />First,I want to thanks to my friend Gianny Painkiller,that made me as gift some money,to can do this order album.<br /><br />Second,I want to thanks to Amazon team,that serving me with promptitude,into sending ,me the product in time,that I ordered it on 25 September 2010,and they estimated that I will receive it on 19 October,but they delivered me on 27 September already ao I was surprise to receive it more early,special that I ordered it from Arad,Romania and the pack came from Lexington,Kentucky,USA.<br /><br />Third,I want to congratulate the band for their idea into do such album,that put the band<br />in a new light in the fans faces,for some of them,in a black light,considering it a decline album,because of the removal of Halford `s band original style albums,but for others and special for musicians like me,in a white light,considering it,an innovative album,and that because of the band idea to change totally the face of the album,by presenting several different styles of music,from a song to another,like  from blues style ballads, such as my favorites Till the Day I Die, or 25 Years ,or I Think We Stand a Chance,then to hard rock, like Heartless,or We Own The Night ,or Like There's No Tomorrow,to heavy metal as Thunder And Lightings,or Made of Metal,or Hellrazor,or Matador,to speed metal as Speed of Sound,or Undisputed,and even to dark metal,as that Mower.A new thing is the introducing in some songs or parts of some songs, the different musical elements of various origins,like for example in the Till The Day I Die song,where we can hear very clear the sound of country blues musical elements, which appears little too somewhere in the Twenty Five Years song,or like from other origins how we hear in the Matador song,where we can hear the Mexican even Spanish musical elements.Besides this,is interesting the presence in some songs of the electronic mixed sounds,usually used by industrial metal bands,which make us to wonder if the nest album will not be some industrial,how we can hear in Made of Metal song,or in Speed of Sound song and also the presence of the piano sound,again a very rare used instrument by the heavy metal bands,such in Twenty Five Years,or in We Own The Night.Another interesting thing,is the way how the guitarists Roy Z, and Mike playing their solo parts,doing the well-known dialogues between guitars in beautiful melody,things invented by Judas Priest band's guitarists,K.K. and Glenn,such in the songs Fire and Ice,or Undisputed,or showing us their technical abilities, and on the Bobby drummer also in the same songs.And finally is to notice the Rob's ability to change his voice in different styles,from his whispering to talk and to screaming touching his high notes,like in The Mower, and to opera even,like in Like There's No Tomorrow or We Own The Night.What is to notice is that almost all song are written in minor range,which definitely give the songs other feelings of listening than a major song.And another thing to notice is that almost all songs and lyrics are written by Rob Halford,what means that Rob is not just a unique voice who can sing what he want but a good composer too who can compose different styles of songs,from opera,and blues,and rock,to metal,and also all kind of lyrics, from love lyrics ,at war lyrics,at fantasies,and to life lyrics.Is to notice that the album contain a videoclip over the Made of Metal song,presented Rob as a alien coming from sky with his 51 number car (his birth date)on the earth Nascar race to win it,and also the album contain a rare song which is totally out of what the band done previously ,meaning the Till The Day I Die Song,and a final mention is that the album contain a song that totally represent the Rob's life experience, meaning his battle with the life vicious until to know the full spirituality,commemoration which he was celebrated this year on 6 January,experience presented in the 25 Years song.In conclusion an interesting album ,a good one, who can lose or win the fan's hearts,mine was win forever,and not just with this album,but long time ago,this album was just another prove that I didn't made a mistake long time ago when I became in love with this band.<br />But lets' look little in details over my top song and see what have special every song.<br /><br />1.Till the Day I Die song, you''ll make you to feel very strange listening it,if you think at what kind of songs you heard in the previous albums and probably you will ask yourself if that is really the Halford band or not, because this song is totally out of what the band done in the previous albums,a song who take you in the Phoenix deserts for free,without to ask your for ticket,that way you will feel when you will hear the western guitars sound from the song intro,which is repeated even over the all verses and all choruses too.Is to the guitars solo from the song middle part playing a beautiful melody,and also the Rob's vocal parts over the verses and choruses,all these being such simple as music composition,but in so touching minor accords,that touch your heart and makes you to listen the song over and over again.Another thing to notice are the lyrics too who speak about the way of life,about how short can be the life and about how few time we have in fact for all things we like to do, these are in fact like a motto that tells us to live the live at the most big intensity and till the day we die.As a entire analize,the song seems to do a good match with the song Just A Little Crazy from War of Words `s Fight band,so is no wonder that there exist a similarity of style between both,considering that Rob's performed in this band too.<br /><br />2.Twenty Five Years,you''ll make to consider this song one of the most touching ballads of Halford band,and because is Rob's entire composition,so his own fault,you probably will wonder why he not has made so far such ballads before,or if he done,where he hiding this until now,and why he shows us this just now.Is interesting to notice the piano sound appearance from the song intro,but in the background of every verses too ,and also is to notice the sudden stop of the song between verses and chorus,then the guitars parts interventions after the first verse singing with the same western sound,and the guitars solos with their beautiful melody singing in triplet at the middle part,then the dialogue between the electric guitars sounds and the acoustic ones, and finally again the guitars solos singing in triplet sound over the Rob's chorus,repeated many time,and with more many intenstity,until the song is ending suddenly with the words 25 years.Its very obviously also the way how Rob singing,from the small intensity in the first choruses and how his voice increase at the final chorus almost like in crying.Is to look carefully over the lyrics too,that have been written by Rob entirely,and that speak about his growth in maturity and about the difficulties he passed over the years until he came to known the human spirituality,thing who he ceremonial was this year on 6 January,also the lyrics are like a urging to pass over our fears of speaking  loud about our way to think and feel, about some or someone.This song is like the most expensive but also beautiful jewelry you bought so from time to time,you must took it from box,clean it and wear it,in our case,this song can give you the most touching feelings,so from time to time,you will need to push the botton cause you will feel good listening itTotally a Rob Halford imprint.<br /><br />3.I Know We Stand a Chance,is another song that will make you to think how this song is looking here,and probably you will not be able to assign it at the Halford style,but over you will listen it,even if you'll be probably bored by the simplicity of the verses and the choruses,and also by the missing of a too good solo guitars parts and by the missing of the intensity of the song,considering it being played at the same intensity from the beggin to the end,also in the end,you will find it a good song to listen because he also have melodicity in verses but in choruses too.And is to notice the lyrics ,who speak about two persons which could have a chance for a last romance in this life,even if they are different, and far one of others,a motto to learn us that not matter what we are,what religion,or sex,or color we have,to be with our soulmates inside we found ourselves.The song resembles with the styles of Rasmus band style.<br /><br />4.Thunder and Lightning,a song that definetly will fill you with energy listening it,and you will think that Halford came back from time to time in this album at his typical style of music of previous albums.Here is to notice the beautiful guitars melody from the song intro,which will be repeated late between verses and choruses,and also the guitars solo parts at the song middle part,Are to notice too the beautiful lyrics too,who speak about two persons,one is the thunder and the<br />other,the light that cover the first,and which are in love,but because them love is denied by most people,they must keep their love as a secret,forever,but the energy of the song,give you the power to fight for a this kind of love,if you live one.The song bring the style of Alice Cooper band songs genre.<br /><br />5.Fire and Ice,another song who''ll definetly bring you lot energy,because of the alert in which the song is singing,and in which is to notice the technical drummer abilities from the start at the end, and the guitars technical abilities too,over their solo parts,even if the Rob's vocal parts over the verses and choruses are such melodical.Is to notice the beautiful lyrics again,who speaks about the love story beween two persons,one is the fire,and the other is the ice,but even if they are different,they complete each other very well.The song, seems to wear the imprint of Hellloween band way.<br /><br />6.The Mower,a song will took you in a other world,full of darkness and where you will feel scared because you don't know what will happen to you on the next few minutes,and that because of the hardness of the song,even from the first,when you will hear Rob's whispering on the song intro,and then when you will hear and feel the hardness of the drums playing and also showing his technical abilities into changing the batting style from a passage to other,and also you will notice the hardness of the guitars too, and finally the Rob's voice,singing like he talk during the verses ,and then  in melody just over the choruses and also you will notice his changes from his voice inflections from a pasage to others,sometime whispering,other time talking,and other time screaming,which shows his vocal abilities to can sing how he want.Is also to notice the dark lyrics in this song,they speak about a king of throne,who reigns over a empty world,without air,light and any exit.The song is totally suitable to be introduce as bonus track on the Crucible album.<br /><br />7.Undisputed,a song  who'll make you to feel like you are the hero man in a war,a song full of rhythm from the beggin to the end,in which all the instruments involved its seems to go in the same rhythm and on the same intenstity even the vocal parts of Rob at least at the verses, even if at the choruses parts, the vocal sing like ...Is to notice also the guitars solo parts from the middle part of the song, where the intrumentalists shows us again their technical abilities and also is interesting the way how the guitarists bring the song at a chromatic scale in the ending of their solo parts.Is again to notice the lyrics,which speak about a king of the world personage.The songs seems to have conection with Manowar band style.<br /><br />8.Made of Metal,a song will sure make to feel being on a track racing,driving the car with number 51,the lucky one,a song that besides his simplicity gaved by the verses and choruses and besides the missing of the guitars interesting solo parts,and of drummer abilities,the song brings also some new elements here cause we can hear clearly the sound of the cars on racing of the song background,and that make us to wonder if Rob do not want to try to compose some industrial.Also the song has a beautiful videoclip too and the lyrics are the same,both shows and  who speak about a 51 number(date of Rob's birth)supersonic car made from metal, which come from space from aliens world, directly on earth on the track racing of Nascar, to win the race,and then going back in space.What is never get it, is why on the hood car not appear the British flag,but the American one,Rob is British,but...also the band formed in USA,so they must to put both,flags.A totally Halford imprint.<br />9.Speed Of Sound,a song who'' still keep you in the same tension as the previous one,like the curse racing in not finish yet, you just took a break, but you must to continue the curse,so this sing can be a good pear with the ex.song,cause has the same simplicity of the verses and the choruses,but also is to mention the guitars melody from the intro part and before the every verses and before, and have the same electronical elements,from the previous song,here we can hear clear the sound of the speed.The lyrics speak about that too.Again a totally Halford embleme.<br /><br />10.Heartless,a song will' make you to take the final break over such curse,is a simple song,simple verses,simple chroruses,simple guitars parts,so definetly all we need is a relax time,but is to notice the beautiful lyrics also,they speak about a man who live confused in a strange world wondering if he is in the right place or not,and also praying his loved one to save him and take him back in the right world.A song match with some song from Resurrection album of same Halford stamp.<br /><br />11.We Own the Night,a simple song too, simple verses and simple choruses but all on the background of a beautiful melodical line,which is found in the guitars solo parts too in the middle parts of the song,and on the Rob's beautiful melody line over the same part,and what is to mention here is the re-appearance of the piano sound on the chorus background.Is to notice the lyrics who speaks about the dreams which all we have in our lives,a  motto which tells us to not stop to dream in some even if our dreams seems impossible.Another  Halford hand too.<br /><br />12.Like There's No Tomorrow,a pear of the previous song,a same simple song,with the same simple verses and choruses but also with beautiful melody line inside,which appear even in the guitars solo parts.Is again to notice the lyrics who speak about the same things as in the previous song.<br /><br />13.Hellrazor,a song who'll took you in the Judas Priest era,and if you are a Judas Priest fan,you will like it,but if you are not,you will ask yourself what is with that song here,and you will think that Halford is such finish of his own inspiration cause they began writing as Judas Priest,or you''ll maybe wonder if they didn't done that with intention.Anyway,the song was concluded in a good song,and even if countain simple verses and choruses,also have a beautiful guitar melody in the middle part.And the lyrics are good too,speaks about a man who like to live free over his own rule.In conclusion ,the song is a good match of the Starbreaker song,from Judas Priest band,you can try to listen them one after other and you will be surprise about the feeling that give you doing this,but also is a Halford signature.<br /><br />14.Matador,a song who will take you in Mexic or..even in Spain,on a toreadors arena,is<br />a simple song,simple verses and choruses,but with beautiful melody line over these,what is to mention is the technical abilities of the drummer again,and also of the guitarists too,and finally is not observed the oriental elements from the guitar sounds in their solo parts of the song middle part.The lyrics speaks about the story of a matador and can make you to think at the Take ABow song of Madonna genre.<br /><br />MESSAGE FOR ROB HALFORD:<br /><br />I congratulate you again for your idea to do such interesting and divers album,I appreciate your ability to compose any kind of music and lyrics on different and interesting themes, and I hope you will do such kind of albums in the future,maybe a album about Dracula life,over you can do a mini opera,with choruses and orchestra, or about Aliens invasion,over you can do also a videoclip, or about Astrology signs with a song for every zodiac sign, as long as you still sing and compose music and lyrics for our minds and our souls and as long as you still admire and appreciate our devotion and our dedication to you ,finally as long as you still likes us and loves as how we likes you and love you always and forever .<br /><br />GLORIA ROMANA SUCIU-THE QUEEN OF METAL GOD-ROB HALFORDxt few minutes,and that because of the hardness of the song,even from the first,when you will hear Rob's whispering on the song intro,and then when you will hear and feel the hardness of the drums playing and also showing his technical abilities into changing the batting style from a passage to other,and also you will notice the hardness of the guitars too, and finally the Rob's voice,singing like he talk during the verses ,and then  in melody just over the choruses and also you will notice his changes from his voice

B0044XV3QY|5.0|This upcoming edition of Avatar is without a doubt the one that fans have been waiting for, and is sure to be one of the highlight Blu-Rays for the holiday season.     Not only are there 2 blu-rays chock full of amazing sounding special features, but we're also getting a 3 hour extended edition featuring the movie's original opening set on planet Earth, this is sure to be the definitive version of the movie to please fans of the original. In addition to the Earth opening, there are plenty of other new and extended scenes, featuring new locations, new animals, more action, and in addition to this are many scenes that help to improve the flow of the story, making Avatar into an even richer film. James Cameron is well known for his Special Editions that improve on his original movies, and this Extended Edition of Avatar is sure to follow in those footsteps. It should also be mentioned that finishing these extra scenes cost over 5 Million dollars, as none of them, except for 1, were completed when the movie was originally released, its not often that so much work and effort is put into an extended edition.    And as amazing as all the announced special features seem, the one that will surely make this set worth owning will without a doubt be the Interactive scene deconstruction. With the ability to view the film in 3 key forms, the original motion capture with the actors in the soundstage, the \\"template\\" which is the inbetween of the motion capture and the final CG, and of course the final version, as well as Picture in Picture with interviews and commentary, this special feature is one that is only possible with the advanced storage space of Blu-Ray. Without a doubt this will be the ultimate look into the making of this film. Overall, this set appears to have more content than the last several blu-rays I've purchased put together. Amazon's current asking price of $36 is an amazing value for a set with so much contained within.

0345477618|5.0|Like you, I Love Star Wars! This book has all those little facts, pictures and info that you couldn't find anywhere and has never been available till now. This book is so well put together it almost makes the Star Wars experience new again. I already ordered the Next instalment: The Empire Strikes Back. Three of my friends have ordered this book after I talked it up so much and they to are overjoyed. I highly recommend it.
B003HLM2QO|2.0|The Ozzman cometh again in 2010 with new album Scream, an album I had put down as an essential purchase for 2010.  But I was wrong.  This latest offering from the legendary bat biter is kind of like when your dad goes out wearing a pair of ¾ length cargo pants:  it might be cool for someone else twenty or thirty years younger but just doesn't sit right with a bloke of this age.  And just as I'd hope my dad would rip `em off and put on a pair of decent trousers the likes of which he used to wear and I respected him for, same goes for Ozzy here.  Act your age man!  Whoever is behind the choice of musical direction on this album really needs to have a good hard look at themselves.  Ozzy, you are not the future defining/inspiring nu-age metal kid, you are the effin' Prince Of Darkness for f's sake!  You have inspired legions of metal bands and fans already, no need to keep on trying to keep on doing it, nor is there any need to cash in on what some might perceive as the flavour of the month.<br /><br />This album abounds in what some might call \\"studio trickery\\" to a ridiculous degree which makes one ponder if Ozzy is still actually really capable of delivering the goods vocally.  It abounds in over production.  It abounds in the chaotic aural clutter of nu-metal/industrial metal, swirling in noise and confusion to the suffering of decent melody.  There are a few exceptions, notably Scream, Life Won't Wait and Time which sound much more like the kind of stuff one hopes to hear from Ozzy, harking back a bit more to the traditional metal sound we all know him for.  And despite its modern style Digging Me Down isn't too bad, but in comparison to stuff from the likes of No More Tears (or any album pre-Black Rain for that matter) or classic Black Sabbath this is not a song Ozzy fans would chose to put on a \\"best of\\" collection.<br /><br />Unfortunately despite some good solos from Gus G here and there, the rest of the album is pretty average, run of the mill to insipid stuff really, with the final track I Love You All perhaps being the ultimate example.  So what we have with this album is a true living legend desperately trying to sound modern and fresh, wanting to prove to the world that he is still an inspiring and relevant force in music today, but coming across like that embarrassing dad in the ¾ cargo pants that you walk three paces behind when you go down the street.the final track I Love You All perhaps being the ultimate example.  So what we have with this album is a true living legend desperately trying to sound modern and fresh, wanting to prove to the world that he is still an inspiring and relevant force in music today, but coming across like that embarrassing dad in the ¾ cargo pants that you walk three paces behind when you go down the street.
B003ASLJKO|5.0|I was pleased with this movie.  I had seen it before, but couldn't remember the plot.  Enjoyable to watch.
B003MZ0I84|3.0|Mutt Lange has a knack for making it all sound effortless. He knows the formula and can turn out tunes with that \\"fresh from the farm\\" feel. This is a good and bad thing. For years he spent glossing up the hits for Shania Twain but you don't have to look far into the Twain cataloge to see that the content is about as deep as a puddle.   \\"Man! I Feel Like A Woman!\\" \\"Don't Be Stupid, You Know I Love You!\\"  Not exactly profound word play. But the man is a radio friendly hit-machine with those not searching too deep for quality.   But, I digress. Lange didn't write the songs on Hands All Over but he might as well have. With the exception of a few tunes, everything has been done before and done better. HAO is really all over the place. The lack of any cohesion isn't the problem, though nothing fits together. The downside for me was the overwhelming corniness.     \\"Misery\\" has a catchy hook, perfectly crafted for radio but something screams \\"This Love 2010\\". I like it for what it is - radio friendly.     \\"Get Back In My Life\\" is Squeeze-revisited. Squeeze circa 1985. Bouncy, lively and only missing the cheeky delivery of Glenn Tilford.     \\"Out Of Goodbyes\\", featuring Lady Antebellum, starts out like a weeper and ends in a wimper. What should be a harmonious blending of vocals turns monotone fast.     \\"Hands All Over\\" tries really hard to be an anthem. The lyrics are really cheesy and, diehards might not agree, it lacks any sex appeal M5 fans come to expect. With a title like that, I sort of expected the signature \\"obscure dirty\\".   This isn't a hand on a thigh. It's a pat on the head.     \\"Last Chance\\"...seriously? The lyrics are just oh-so-bad.   \\"I bet that he could give your everything/Stability and diamonds rings/All the things I do not have/I know you can't handle that.\\"     \\"I Can't Lie\\" is growing on me but it sounds dated. I've heard this before, much like \\"Get Back In My Life\\". Only this time, it's more Motown then Brit pop. I could hear Smokey Robinson singingthis. In 1965.     \\"Never Gonna Leave This Bed\\" could've been recorded by Journey. Of course, it would've been a little faster and far more passionate.      \\"Stutter\\" sounds like a novelty tune in the same vein as \\"Stacy's Mom\\" by Bowling For Soup. I expect a video of all the boys, leaning on a wall, snapping their finger in unison while wearing Ray Bans and leg warmers.     \\"Give A Little More\\" is perhaps the best song on the album. Adam Levine's voice is flawless. This is HAO's \\"Makes Me Wonder\\". A little funky, a little sexy and alot catchy.     \\"No Curtain Call\\" (available on the deluxe edition) is my second favorite song on the album. No sure why this wasn't part of the original 12 tunes selected because it should be. It's far more captivating than alot of the songs that made the original cut.     The acoustic verison of \\"Misery\\" (available on the deluxe edition) is a huge letdown. This is where Lange's production comes in. Acoustic usually feels a little more free-form, a little edgier. This acoustic tale doesn't feel acoustic at all; like it's not instruments but a generic digital recording. A music bed you would hear in a commercial for Pringles.     Lastly, the cover of Alicia Keys \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" is lovely and safe. Levine's voice is in fine form. It's a straight forward cover. No special M5 infused flavor. I'm not a Keys fan, so I have to say M5's cover is far superior to her yelling/singing.     All and all...a bit of a letdown. There are a few sparkling gems but missing is that signature M5 smirk. Like your privy to the inside joke. With \\"Songs About Jane\\" and \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\", I felt like we got into the mind of the band and for 45-50 minutes, hung out. HAO is all formula with little payoff.    3 stars for Adam Levine's voice and the few tunes that deliver the happy ending.
B003TVMIDO|1.0|The reviewer named Quoter is COMPLETELY dead-on right.  These remasters are TERRIBLE. Most people reviewing and leaving comments have not clue,  because they did not hear the remasters from 2002. Those were great.  I just played every track from Plastic Ono Band one by one from the original 2002 remasters  then played the tracks from this Signature series which I just bought.  Complete disaster. Not even in the same league.  If the 2002 remasters are a 10, this new box set is a 1.5-if that.  I even have the regular CDs from the 90s and those are not much different from these new ones,  except from some hiss which was removed.    So all you people without any clue, simply listen to Plastic Ono from this set, then buy the 2002 remastered version.  What's insane is that you don't even have to listen closely to hear how horrible this new set is.    And it does not include ALL of lennon's stuff.  The Lennon Anthology set was the best ever.  Buy that over this crap. I got mine at best buy for $180 and returning it tomorrow.  No way I'm keeping this crap.    The packaging is nothing special. Lennon deserves MUCH better.  Oh well, there's always vinyl.
B003DZX44I|5.0|This film has always been my favorite Disney movie. It is the first movie I can remember seeing. I watch it when I'm having a bad day, a good day, and anything in between.    HD is how this film was meant to be seen. The colors are richers, the image crisper and the sound is phenomenal. I already owned the Platinum Edition DVD but am so glad I upgraded. The opening sequence made me weep for it's beauty and that is when I knew it was money well spent.

B001992NW4|5.0|THIS FILM IS UNGODLY!<br /><br />And like most people who've seen it, I think it is by far the scariest movie ever made.<br /><br />I just watched the Blu-ray version at a friends house, and I thought it was fantastic. But this movie is so scary and so ungodly, THAT I REFUSE TO EVER BRING IT INTO MY HOUSE!<br /><br />This is the only movie that ever gave me goosebumps- made the hair on the back of my neck stand up- and literally made my skin crawl.<br /><br />This movie had me sleeping with the lights on and staring into vacant space, wondering if I was being watched by an invisible demonic entity preparing to possess my soul.<br /><br />Yikes!
B0019NB9A2|5.0|This is a great Sci-Fi classic that looks even better on Blu-ray. To top it off, there are a lot of informative and interesting extras on the disc. A must have for Sci-Fi fans everywhere!!
B000J3OTSM|3.0|I think the big problem is that we saw Step up 3D in 3D at a wonderful theater (in fact we liked it so much we went back to see it a week later). Step up 3D skipped most of the plot and focused on fantastic dancing.  I guess we were expecting the same for this movie but the proportion of plot to dancing was too much plot, too little dancing.  The dancing that they did was fantastic but the dance scenes were too far apart and the movie took itself too seriously.  It was not bad, just not good and not as enjoyable at Step up 3D.
0525951652|3.0|I have a been a huge fan of Ken Follet's other epic historical novels, recommending them to multiple friends and family members who all loved them, too. This is the first one I can't really recommend.  It is okay, but drags too much.  I had trouble pushing myself to read all the way through the book because whole sections bored me.  I found myself wanted to skip ahead in the story to just read those chapters that involved the characters I found interesting -- and several of them just weren't very interesting.      I think the book would have benefitted from some firm editing to tighten things up a bit and shorten it.  All in all, although I enjoyed parts of the book, I don't see myself reading numbers two and three in this trilogy.
B0043UGKAM|5.0|I watched this series when it was on Netflix Watch Instantly.  I will admit, I was not 100% into it right off the bat.  I watched the first three episodes late into the night and by the end of the second or third episode, I was hooked.  This show is bloody, it contains nudity, and the dialog is not always fantastic; but behind all of that is a very well told story and characters that you really grow to care about.  This is an excellent series and I'm anxious for season 2.  If you only watch half of an episode, just like most shows, you will probably not like it.
1590581814|1.0|Have to add mine to the list of 1-star reviews. I wholeheartedly agree with the other low reviewers who say it was disjointed and it bounced from one spot to the next. But my biggest peeve was the complete lack of characterization: The characters only had a first name (most of them); the physical description was lacking; they lacked detail, or any kind of distinct way of speaking. As a result, I found myself having to flip back and try to figure out who these characters were. Who is Standard, Blanche, Irina, Shannon, etc.? Why should I care about them? They're given such minimal characterization that they seem to distract from the story. Sallis gives Dr. Amy Park a full name and a better physical description than most of the main characters (she's only on for 2 pages). Like I said before, the story definitely feels disjointed, as if someone copied and pasted a bunch of short stories together (the chapters range from the tedious, for the most part, to mildly interesting).  Lastly, Driver is given little physical description and depth. What's his motivation? Why is he so laconic? Why doesn't he seem to have any hobbies, goals, dreams, desires, or anything that would give him character? He is thoroughly empty; which means I could care less about his fate. And when you don't care about the fate of the main character, the story is a waste.
B003XU02QG|2.0|After watching the preview for this film I thought it looked promising.  It turns out to be rather typical and generally disappointing.  It's really just a bunch of fight scenes broken up by A LOT of running.  There's really not much of a plot.  If you're interested in watching this movie I would just save yourself the $7 and read one or two of the favorable reviews; you will get at least as much storyline as the movie gives.  This is one of those movies that looks like it could have been good but it just fell short.  Don't waste your money.
B0036TGSR6|3.0|Laughable wish-list film presentation for the liberals of the world. Or, \\"How We Wish This Would Happen To Tony Blair\\".<br /><br />Having said that, the creativity and skill factor of the filmmakers is very high. Taking the moronic and lame attempts at politicking out of the film and this becomes a very decent thriller with Ewan McGregor doing a solid performance as the ghostwriter following in the exact steps of a colleague who died under very suspicious circumstances.<br /><br />Again, putting aside the schoolyard politics, my only minor complaints were three fold.<br /><br />First, was the use of Kim Cattrall as a Brit. In all seriousness, while I'm constantly amazed at the ability of UK and Aussie actors to pull off a very convincing generic American accent - it most certainly is not a reciprocal skill. Having a US actor going about with the posh elites looks and sounds pathetically anglophile and oh-so-insecure.<br /><br />Second, Polanski's use of a concrete bunker was bit overmuch; he might as well have stenciled in 'Reichskanzlei' in gothic script to make his point.<br /><br />And finally, I question the obvious audio track edits to remove a fairly common profane word. Edits that, for all intents and purposes, had negligible effect on either storyline or character development. So why do it at all? And in the case of Brosnan's former PM - a definite weakening of what could have been a much more ominous characterization.<br /><br />A decent thriller for film fans, a pathetic wishful rewriting of history for liberals, and an inane stab for conservatives. Let's give Director Polanski credit where credit is due for delivering something for everyone and nothing particular for no one.
B0019MU6HU|5.0|BrainDead I'm going to repost your review because you took the works rights out of my mind, and said it better than I could have! All I can say is Ditto!!!!      BrainDead (Dallas, TX) -  \\"I could not put this book down. I read it in one sitting. Not only is it a great read, the format of passages interspersed with lost lyrics, photos, and artwork is fantastic, and made it much more of a multi-dimensional experience than merely reading words. The words themselves tell a story that is tragic, heart-wrenching, shocking, gritty and at times sickening in their truth. This is a story of the un-glamorous disease of addiction in the glamorous world of entertainment and rock and roll. The honesty is brutal, and it left me changed. I have nothing but admiration for Nikki in his willingness to share this unflattering aspect of his life in the effort to save if only one soul. Many thanks for this gift.\\"
1416549447|3.0|Sorry, but I don't think Chi running is too terribly different from the older \\"pose\\" method of running described by Coach Alexander Romanov.  A few important adjustments, but not a \\"revolutionary approach.\\"  This might be a very good read for new runners or runners who have never considered their form.<br /><br />The author implies that Chi running is \\"effortless\\" and that you don't use your leg muscles to run which is simply absurd; if it was there would be no need to train.  The idea that you use form, posture and stride to work with gravity is very helpful and spot on, but still, one does have to move and lift the legs.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|My words will only reiterate the high praise of the other reviewers. No album (& book) has ever affected me so deeply, so emotionally, and touched me to the core of my soul as this album has! The Heroin Diaries accompanies the book, and could be described as a modern rock opera or concept album. It chronicles the years '86-'87 when Nikki hit rock bottom with his addiction to heroin and other substances. Yes, the subject matter is heavy and unsettling, but it is musically phenomenal. Lyrically it is simultaneously horrifying, riveting, courageous and uplifting. It will cause you to self reflect, and give you the strength your own inner demons what ever they may be. Most definitely one of the best albums ever. You must listen to it from beginning to end without skipping to truly grasp how amazing this work of art is. I recommend it to all even if you are not a fan of the rock genre, Motley Crue, or Nikki Sixx. If you aren't you will be after hearing this!     In cause you don't believe how much I love this album, below are the # of plays on my iPod alone. (Counts do not include plays on CD, regular iTunes library, YouTube, or PS3 import)  1.

0316098337|5.0|That about sums it up.  I was just drawn to it.  I haven't been this absorbed in a book in a long time....Read it..
0312600844|5.0|... and that is:  it was a good read.  Too simple for the critics?  Perhaps.  But the bottom line for me was that it was a story of people made up by a talented author, who lived their lives with its roller coaster of activities and happenstances--similar to how we all do.  Now, the average person won't have a son who ends up selling used truck parts for large sums of money or may not personally know people who engage their own private war against cats who kill birds; when we have to admit, we've all met some pretty odd people along the way into enormously more harmful (and outlandish) things.    I enjoyed the detail Franzen provides about the thoughts and misgivings of his characters, when others have referred to these details as unnecessary, boring and contrived.  In my opinion, writing such as Franzen's makes the one-book-a-year, follow the same old template of story line books that flood the bookstore shelves look like fluff.  If some of the chapters took longer to get through than others, I chalked it up to the way things are:  some days take longer to get through than others as well.  Franzen did an excellent job of taking us through many, many days of his characters, who, it seemed to me, had struggles, doubts, limited successes without guilt, large and small decisions to make and heartbreaks, just as we all do.    That Patty stayed infatuated with Katz for so many years?  Sure...who hasn't fallen for the bad boy, wondered if your adoration for him would change his ways and then ultimately put him aside, still harboring some yearnings?  And that Walter should turn from nice guy into an environmental fanatic without (as some critics have said) any cause?  Disappointments in children, spouses and the world in general when you have the hard wiring of caring such as Walter's has turned many a malleable person bitter and resentful--with the manifestation being much more self serving than what Walter was trying to accomplish.    The novel and its contents are worththe time involved to complete the tale.  The overly critical readers should just put the book down and go on to something else--and refrain from rating a book they can't finish.  For me, even after reading numerous critical reviews and blog postings myself, the only time I wasted was in that regard--I should have skipped all the mis-directed comments from people who seem to enjoy hearing themselves complain, and gone straight to the book itself.  I anxiously await a next novel from Franzen.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|This review is based on the Publisher's decision to price the Kindle download at $20. Are you kidding? What if someone wants to own a physical copy as well as a digital copy? Now, they will need to fork over upwards of $40. The publishers should be ashamed of their greedy price gouging. I will NEVER pay this much for a bestseller.
0810983915|5.0|I really like your books. You have a great sense of humor and are good at doing cartoons. The minute I got the 3rd book I just started laughing meaning I really liked the book. So I thought the books were so great that I chose to put them in rankings:  1.#3  2.#4  3.#2  4.#1  I also have the movie that I got in the summertime and Have the movie novel and the Do-It-Yourself book.  I am so happy about the books and the type of books they are.  The only items left by you that I so want is the movie soundtrack, book #5 The Ugly Truth. Thank you so much for writing these books. More books by you I would really like. But if you can do that.  The last thing I am going to tell is that I have also gotten into the Big Nate series. The 5th book sounds so RAD. Please write more books.

The exact same misrepresentation on both the case and the disc also goes for All the other releases on DVD. WARNER BROTHERS ARE DISTRIBUTION FAILURES. There has YET to be a Wide-Screen presentation of \\"The Exorcist\\", hell even \\"Harold and Maude\\" (a truly awful film) is presented in Wide-Screen format and better remastering, so why not the classic of classics? because Warner Brothers is GARBAGE
B00178H27S|1.0|It seems to be a lotto.  Some have drain plug, some do not.  But the description states there is one. Very frustrating. Amazon customer service was amazing and refunded me in full.
0553385461|5.0|If you're not a mathematician or a ohysicist, you're not going to spend a lot of time wrapping your head around the concept of strings that possibly have 26 dimensions. That said, this book will describe string theory, particles, the expansion of the universe, and general relativity in about as much detail as the average lay person can handle without making a career out of it. I am very interested in these topics myself, and love hearing about discoveries in the news, etc., but never really sat down and read a book that summarized it all in a way that made me feel I had a grip on all of the basics. In other words, I had heard of string theory, but only in second-hand accounts from people who might not have understood it themselves. And although I often heard that Einstein said it is impossible to travel faster than the speed of light, I never understood the mechanics of why that is. This book informed me exactly to the point where I felt I had understood the general concepts, and stopped short of going into the level of detail that would require lots of math on a chalkboard. In keeping the subject matter limited to a clear understanding of the basics, the authors also managed to make it a quick, enjoyable read.

B003YOZNBK|1.0|Jonah Hex is bad. Really bad. Please turn around now and pick up another movie.<br /><br />Don't trust the low Amazon rating? Read on. I have an almost masochistic fascination with really bad films so I watched this knowing it got terrible reviews from movie-goers and reviewers alike. Sometimes a movie is so bad, you just have to watch it to experience the utter ridiculosity of the filmmaker and new-found heights of cinematic stupidity, like Uwe Boll's seminal crapfest [[ASIN:B00466FMDO House of the Dead]], ranked consistently in IMDB's 100 worst films of all time. Even in its awfulness, there's a sort of [[ASIN:B00006RJCL Mystery Science Theater 3000]]-like entertainment value as an example of WTF filmmaking to poke fun at. It's so bad, it makes you laugh. Jonah Hex is so bad it makes you want to punch all those involved in bringing this atrocity to the screen. Aside from the sight of the lovely Megan Fox in a bodice, there's really no reason to watch this complete mess of a film. If you enjoyed last summer's bomb [[ASIN:B002NXSRX4 G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra]], however, you might like Jonah Hex.<br /><br />Previous reviewers hit it right on the head when they likened JH to Wild Wild West and Van Helsing for its mix of western, sci-fi and steampunk. All 3 films had big, likable stars, were ridiculously campy and failed miserably at the box office. I'll add in another: [[ASIN:B000ICLRHU The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]] for JH's similarity in plot of bad guy building a terrifying ship-based superweapon that can level cities and supernatural/occult overtones. I like hero/anti-hero action, westerns/period films and historical fiction, with an occasional bit of camp, but with a muddled script, a snooze-inducing villain, and a really crappy hero, Jonah Hex manages to get everything wrong in its brief 72 minutes. On top of that, the decision to mix heavy metal into the film was just dumb. The consistently excellent Marco Beltrami provides part of the score and progressive metal band Mastadon provides the rest. Westerns and heavy metal do not mix, especially during shootouts, adding a decided factor of cheese to the whole thing. I like westerns, I like action. I like metal. I do not like them all at once.<br /><br />Never mind some of the severe gaps in storytelling logic: Eli Whitney, inventor of the cotton gin, went on to design a secret super-weapon for the US government that it never built, but it had all the parts and plans just lying around? Never mind that a band of ex-Confederate rebels with no scientific or engineering background can build the thing in a few weeks or the unexplained source of the glowing orbs that provide the explosive power. Never mind because this movie is already so bad that logic gaps can't make it worse.<br /><br />Josh Brolin, who I loved in [[ASIN:B0011BE3K0 No Country for Old Men]], is totally uninteresting in his portrayal of the title character. Maybe there wasn't much he could've done with the script. He is devoid of personality and so is his arch enemy, John Malkovich, who looks more like bum than villain and maybe even more boring than he was in [[ASIN:B000NA28I4 Eragon]]. The last time I saw this much wood was at a gay pride parade. Michael Fassbender does give the film a much-needed splash of personality as the vicious and combat-adept Irish psychopath Burke, as does Aiden Quinn as President Grant, and the Smith who makes Jonah's gear. In his brief 2 or 3 minutes onscreen, Smith manages to convey more warmth and personality than Brolin does in the entire film.<br /><br />What killed this movie, aside from the lack of character development and plot that's as chopped up as Hex's face, was just how lame Hex was as a hero. I'm not familiar with the comics, but if Hex is supposed to be the strong, silent type, you won't see it here. Brolin's Hex can hardly fight and gets shot really easily. He's pretty much a wimp and a bungler. I didn't expect to see the archetypal \\"Man With No Name\\" that Clint Eastwood made famous (though there is a scene ripped off from Fistful of Dollars), but I did expect a solid measure of bad-assedness, self-reliance, and the ability to avoid getting shot, either by using brains, or quick reflexes. He seems to have no knowledge of combat/assault tactics and would've died if not for the unexplained Indian medicine men who keep reviving his sorry carcass. He depends on fancy weapons more than wit, quick-thinking, or fighting abilities. The gatling gun that features so prominently on the movie poster, you see only once. For about 20 seconds. He is so poor at being a hero that he gets ambushed trying to do an ambush -- he gets jumped by Burke as he tries to sneak up the plank to their boat. At night... Lastly is some questionable CG. The crayola-colored dreamworld/flashback sequences are cheesy and poorly done as are some really fake looking explosions. Even the superweapon is lame. It shoots out cannonballs, and then a glowing Dragon Ball to detonate them.<br /><br />Ugh.. watch this only if you feel life is too long. I'm hoping there's a director's cut somewhere that can redeem this movie somewhat. As it stands, 1.5 stars at most.is a scene ripped off from Fistful of Dollars), but I did expect a solid measure of bad-assedness, self-reliance, and the ability to avoid getting shot, either by using brains, or quick reflexes.

Let this be a lesson to any would be writer or director, it'll be your cash cow, if you are sitting on a bad to mediocre romance story, if you write the couple as gay, no one will have the courage to give it a bad review or even call it what it is; boring.

0618918248|3.0|In my view Dawkings has some obvious worth, but Dawkins is also a successful author, so \\"follow the money\\" and I assume he has derived a substantial amount of his wealth from his books, perhaps more wealth than he ever derived from teaching Zoology to college kids.  His amount of pomposity is sometimes obnoxious to we believers, but give the devil his dues, he does have his moments.      Christian religious belief is built on faith, you either believe in the risen Christ or you're not a believer, simple as that.  The Muslims for example, believe in Christ but they do not believe in the risen Christ, believing instead that his body was stolen by his cult following who fanned rumors that he had arisen.  The bedrock of Christian belief is that WE ARE JUSTIFIED BY OUR FAITH - period.  Once we have proper faith all other things come naturally to the true believer.      I am a believer because quite simply I couldn't imagine one could believe otherwise, I have heard the voice of God and I was transformed.  I have no real beef with those who disbelieve, I will witness to them when I can, but I don't scoff them, I don't hate them, instead I pray for them.  I believe for a myriad of reasons which reduces Dawkins theories to gibberish, in comparison he's just a man naturally given to sin, to selfishness and to greed.  So, follow the money!      Trying to consider both sides, I give this book 3 stars.
0312600844|5.0|One thing I'm learning at this later stage in my life is to try not to judge a book before I finish it. About a third of the way through I was having such a hard time finding an inroad with these characters, and how to connect to them for their almost universal unlike-ability, that as much as I was marveling at the construction and technical merits of the story, I wasn't completely tapped in. Then, about halfway in I found myself thinking about these people when I'd put the book down, and even though some might consider some of what they do reprehensible, I found their sometimes big flaws made them only more human, and winning. I think it's a pretty honest depiction of an American family in a declining narcissistic society. And as bleak as our world might be getting, Franzen manages to ultimately find some redemptive hope, which is what won me over in the end.

0316069485|5.0|Nesting within a defense lawyer's trial bag, next to the laptop, iPad and laster pointer, is a playbook. One of the oldest and most effective plays within it is the old misdirection play. The lawyer gives every appearance of advancing a particular position, or line of questioning, while concealing the true nature of the theory of the case or the evidence sought. Non-lawyers who write about trials rarely get it right, and most fictional lawyers are predicable in their theories and tactics. Real trial lawyers always have surprises in in their bags and when two really good lawyers face off the surprises can take your breath away.    Michael Connelly is no ordinary mystery writer. In the pantheon of living practitioners of the craft he is in the holy trinity. What is amazing about Connelly is that years of reporting both in Los Angeles and South Florida have given him a keen ear for trial practice, tactics, evidence and dialogue. But mostly Connelly is the master of plot, and able to drive both a trial and characters to a riveting conclusion, with hardly any suspension of belief.    The Reversal opens with Mickey Haller, defense lawyer star of [[ASIN:B002MAQSAM The Lincoln Lawyer]] being offered a bizarre proposition. The Los Angeles District Attorney wants to hire him as a special prosecutor. His mission is to retry a convicted child killer. The California Supreme Court ordered a new trial of the 24 year old case because DNA testing had eliminated this individual as the source of the semen found on the murdered girl's dress. The whole world, or at least the Los Angeles Times has assumed that this means that Jason Jessup was an innocent man, and that the office would son be paying millions as compensation for his wrongful imprisonment. The prospect of a big payday meant that no plea deal would be possible, and the D.A. wanted a fall guy to take the heat for the inevitable loss. Haller thus became the \\"Go To\\" lawyer or more like the \\"Go To\\" stooge for the prosecutor's office. Mickey exacted his own conditions, he wanted his ex-wife ADA Maggie McPherson as his second chair and Detective Harry Bosch, Connelly preeminent series character, his half brother, as his investigator.     Other Connelly characters like FBI agent-profiler Rachel Walling wander in and out of these pages freely, giving long time Connelly fans the sense they know what's coming next. They don't. Like Jessup's lawyer Clive Royce, Connelly is a master of misdirection. Faster and more unpredictable than a high-speed roller coaster on a pitch-dark track, the pages of The Reversal throw your assumptions to the wind. Once you start, you can't get off.
B001ACY8D2|5.0|Coming across this musical group, Sigur R&oacute;s, was a happy addendum to viewing the very extraordinary film ONDINE.  For those who have yet to see this atmospheric otherworldly love story, do.  And realize that the mysterious song that accompanies the figure of Ondine is the work of Sigur R&oacute;s. The title of this album is MED SUD I EYRUM VID SPILUM ENDALAUST which in English means \\"With a Buzz in our Ears We Play Endlessly\\".  The language is Icelandic and the mood that this very unique group expresses is much in keeping with that raw, barely touched, beautiful land few of us have had the pleasure of visiting. Sigur R&oacute;s  is an Icelandic post-rock band with melodic, classical, and minimalist elements. The band is known for its ethereal sound and lead singer J&oacute;nsi Birgisson's falsetto, and unfortunately for those of us who have discovered them only recently, the band is on hiatus. That is a loss.<br /><br />On this particular album (the terrific cover art is by Ryan McGinley) the moods shift from playful to fanciful to tenderness.  The final track 'All Right' is the only song sung in English and accompanied by piano.  It is haunting enough to hear over and over. But that is not to disparage the other works, songs of voice and guitar and simply the band.  According to the liner notes this is music that is free-spirited happiness and exploration - exploration in the true sense of working with all of the instruments and voices to uncover the possibilities, as well as pioneer like exploration of the world art large. This is exceptional music and the first response is to buy another of their several albums!  Grady Harp, October 10

B00027JZ3E|4.0|Well, it's 2010, and Stephenie Meyers' Twilight Saga is literally changing the way we see vampires, and that's pretty much a BAD thing. I personally have never read the books, nor have I seen the movies, but because of all the things I've heard about them, I think it's best for me to just stay away from them as much as possible. But anyway, there are other (and better) vampire movies that I'm glad to have seen. Interview With The Vampire, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Blade, and The Lost Boys to name just a few. In particular, The Lost Boys, the 1987 film by Joel Schumacher, is pretty much a classic in the teenage vampire genre, and it shows. It's dark, intense, and edgy. It's filled with some great 80's music, and some pretty nice-looking 80's fashion (punk, goth, heavy metal, etc.). What I don't like in the film, unfortunately, are the characters Sam, Edgar, and Allan Frog: they were sometimes annoying in several scenes. Also, the story is a bit on the weak side: I won't spoil anything, but I will say that the ending is a bit dissatisfying. Still, The Lost Boys is something that will please almost every vampire fan. I, on the other hand, am not a fan of vampires, but I can still tell that this is a very good movie.<br /><br />Grade: 7.5/10
0240816250|4.0|Disclaimer: I am casually acquainted with one of the authors (R.L.) via a photography forum, and one of my images is included in this book.  However, I feel that neither of these issues preclude me from offering an honest critique.    I was at first struck by the size of this book: with 500+ pages, it is an encyclopedia!   But the volume of this book is appropriate for its broad, technical scope.  The book addresses the physiological aspects of seeing, and the refinement of print tonality... and everything in between.  Consistent with the modern context, the reader will also find a thorough treatment of all the digital, hybrid, and traditional tools.  With a strong emphasis on clarifying techniques, this book is *very* thoroughly illustrated.  Hardly a page is without an example, an illustration or a graph.  In addition, numerous tables and templates are found in an appendix.  It's literally impossible for me to locate a technical topic that wasn't appropriately described. Yes, MTF, dry down, transmittance etc. are all given full schrift!     The risk that the authors take with this book is to overwhelm the reader with the technical scope, with insufficient treatment of the  creative aspects that must always drive the successful craft.  Indeed the book contains ~90% technical content.  There is a small section on visualization, and a larger \\"On Assignment\\" section with narrated examples, but the reader will not find much discussion of fundamental issues such as: what distinguishes black and white photography as an art form; why black and white is effective in some cases for which color photography is not; and the special role of certain abstract graphical elements in the black and white craft.      For my own taste, there could and probably should be more weight given to these qualitative aspects, and for that reason my rating of this book is not perfect.  That said, I realize that most readers expect and appreciate the technical guidance...  and abstract statementsabout the unique effectiveness of black and white photography are probably best made with photographs rather than words!    Overall, this book is a real achievement- an authoritative reference that will be widely cited for many years to come.  I recommend it very highly, and note that the low price is a very pleasant surprise, given the volume of very useful information.  I am certain that this book will be at least as successful as the first edition, which is also very highly regarded.

B0001611DI|5.0|Dawn Of The Dead (1978) is one of the great zombie movies ever made.  Now I'm talking about the original, of course.  George Romero once again delivers a great zombie movie.  It stars David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger, Gaylen Ross, and Tom Savini.<br /><br />Basically the movie is about some unknown pandemic that causes flesh-eating zombies to emerge.  This phenomena spreads throughout the U.S.  Four survivors hide in a shopping mall and find themselves fighting the zombies.  The movie is extremely gorey.  Extremely bloody.  It has great special gore effects by special effects guru Tom Savini, who also appears in the movie.  You'll see blood splatter everywhere.  Lots of gunfire.  Lots of violence.<br /><br />The zombies are very basic looking.  The vast majority of them just have their faces painted with grey or blueish-grey makeup.  Since the movie had a budget of only about $650,000 and there were SO MANY zombies, this basic makeup had to do.  Besides that, there was no such thing as CGI back in 1978.  Had there been CGI, the zombies would have looked more realistic, but I'm not a fan of CGI for the most part.<br /><br />This DVD has some good special features.  It's in widescreen format and is remastered in 5.1 DTS & Dolby Digital Surround Sound.  It also has audio commentary from writer and director George Romero, assistant director Chris Romero, special makeup effects artist Tom Savini, and is moderated by Perry Martin.  Also included are the theatrical trailers, TV spots, radio spots, poster and advertising gallery, a bio on George Romero, and a comic book preview.<br /><br />If you like extremely violent zombie movies, then this George Romero classic should entertain you.  It's not a Halloween-ish kind of zombie movie, but it's highly entertaining nevertheless.
0312600844|5.0|Franzen is a lucid and amusing writer with tremendous insight about his characters. Here, for example, are thoughts from Franzen about the character Richard Katz, a cool fringe rock musician who is uncomfortable with success. \\"...for Katz's Jewish paternal forebears, who'd been driven from shtetl to shtetl by implacable anti-Semites... feeling bad all the time and expecting the worst had been natural ways of equilibriating themselves with the lousiness of their circumstances. Few things gratified depressives, after all, more than really bad news. This obviously wasn't an optimal way to live but it had evolutionary advantages.... Grim situations were Katz's niche the way murky water was a carp's.\\"<br /><br />Within this world of wonderful and insightful prose, FREEDOM operates like a matrix for its major characters--Richard Katz and Walter, Patty, and Joey Berglund. For each of these, Franzen examines: how or what a character will do to achieve and consolidate a position in the ruling class; how a person's early family experiences have inescapable effects on adulthood and adult relationships; and how a character experiences and uses his freedom.<br /><br />To illustrate how this works, take the case of Walter, who grew up with an alcoholic father and thereby developed very high expectations for personal behavior. Walter, as it turns out...<br /><br />... is, in the most high-minded fashion, able to sell out his principles to have an impact on the world;<br /><br />...has a tender and conscientious streak, developed as a teenager to compensate for his useless father, that inhibits his nature and dissatisfies his wife Patty; and<br /><br />...sees freedom, as do the other major characters, as an enabler of mistakes. \\"You may be poor,\\" he says, \\"but the one thing nobody can take away from you is the freedom to f*** up your life whatever way to want to. That's what Bill Clinton figured out.\\"<br /><br />IMHO, FREEDOM is at its best when examining the plights of Richard and Patty. The reason is that Franzen makes their situations fully believable at all times. Since Richard is from a troubled family and has had ups and downs as a musician, for example, his propensity for short-term relationships and skepticism about success make perfect sense. Likewise, Patty's competitive mother and cruel father affect her relationship with her husband and children and help explain her marginal connection, outside of motherhood, to the world.<br /><br />In contrast, Franzen is very heavy on the satire when he explores the adventures of Walter and Joey. As other reviewers have pointed out, the principled Walter, in satire, embraces mountain top removal to create a bird sanctuary while the entrepreneurial undergraduate Joey becomes an arms dealer in Iraq. Nothing, of course, is wrong with satire. But in FREEDOM, these satirical subplots read long, since they are primarily displays of Franzen's black and downward-spiraling imagination. As narrative, they are undeniably clever; but they're just too improbable to feel character-driven. They lack, in other words, buried emotional issues that grip the reader and keep him (her) turning pages, eager to learn the resolution. Instead, the satires are about the next disaster the clever Franzen can cook up.<br /><br />Still, the five-hanky ending (my highest rating) makes the long journey worthwhile. Recommended and rounded up to five stars.eir situations fully believable at all times.

B002VECM6S|5.0|To be honest, I was not interested at all to watch this film but my boyfriend recorded it anyways. One night I could not sleep and I couldn't find anything to watch so I played this movie. I ended up waking up my boyfriend because I was crying and laughing at the same time. Sandra played her part like a pro and the actor who played SJ was amazing. I'm a big time Packers fan but because of this movie, I am going to watch Mr. Oher play. His story is so moving and he has come so far considering how horrible his life began. I do NOT understand why people are claiming that this movie was racist. It was based on fact, with some of things altered for the movie. So what if a rich white family helped out a poor black kid? I say good for them and there should be more people like them out there who are willing to help out kids that need help, despite the color of their skin. I'm ashamed of the ignnorance of today.

B002ZG98UA|2.0|I think they're starting to use 3D as a clutch to make bad movies like this seem better than what it really is. Like \\"oh well just make a crappy movie, but put it in 3D and let the idiots eat it up!\\"    I watched this and I was bored enough to want to skip to all the action scenes in this movie and just be done with it. So if you were somewhat bored of the older resident evils, then I'd avoid this. Being 3D should barely be enough to consider watching this in the theater, even a rental might be questionable, but worth it cause of the curiosity.    There's really nothing at all new in this installment. It was boring, same o same o action kind of movie. Honestly, I really thought it would be like a war of the clones type of movie considering how the previous one ended. It was a bit at first but was cut short. I really can't find a good reason why this movie was even made since it didn't even give a closing ending and is giving further excuse to make another RE. Lack of action and when there are some action scenes, they're all boring because you've seen it all example would be the matrix-like fight scene. Nothing new that'll make you want to watch this. It's just not worth it in my honest opinion.    I'm also a bit confused on why they call it AFTERLIFE. I have a theory, but so far nothing big to confirm it.      SPOILER ALERT!    The guy also injects her with something that takes away her powers, strengths and speed and \\"neutralizes\\" the T virus. So how come it doesn't show much through the movie? She seems weaker, but other than her telekinesis being gone, it's hard to really say she's physically human again in terms of those things...

B0034G4OVS|2.0|Because only white people get into these messes.    SPOILER ALERT!    1. Why would anyone in their right mind want to ski when its almost dark and it's almost closing time?  2. Why did they not tie all their coats and clothing together and make a rope. Even if it doesn't go too far down, it is still better than dropping the full distance?  3. If you see it's high like that, jump towards a tree and maybe the branches will break your fall? Obviously dropping straight down without any ideas...is a bad idea??  4. When the snow plow came, they should have immediately took off their snow skis/boards and throw it down to get attention. But noooo, they waited till the guy was backing up and looking away.  5. When the other guy, Dan Walker? The third wheel guy. Why does he try to climb up on the slippery ice covered metal seat....with his hard plastic snow boots which has no grip???  6. Him trying to climb the cable like that?? You usually climb ropes by getting ur legs around the rope and pulling yourself with your hand. I dunno, they did mention it was sharp, but him climbing that was just stupid to begin with but the idea was the best one they had at that point.    TO BE UPDATED WHEN I FINISH MOVIE.  K FINISHED!    7. Huddling together for warm would be a good idea they should have done, instead they sorta all stayed separated even though on a small chair.  8. Could they not have buried part of their face into their coat? I'm usually able to. This would have kept their face from being exposed as much as possible.      This movie lacks good camera usage and the suspense never becomes that good. Lacking movie and a very lacking ending.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Don't let my title fool you, this is a great movie.  I was extremely skeptical at first, because I have read many of the books and watched much of the old shows, but although this doesn't seem like the Holmes from those stories it is still vagely accurate to them and the cast is great.  Knowledgable fans would know that Holmes is a boxer, fencer, and master in those fighting sticks, so naturally Hollywood focuses on the action part of it and not suspense, but that shouldn't surprise anybody.  Good movie, watch it at least.

B003TXT5ZQ|4.0|An excellent version for the Kindle if you don't want to have to page through a ton of footnotes. No line numbering either, but it does have an active/linked ToC, a big plus plus for me. Frankly, in the Kindle, clicking on a footnote link mid-text is tedious. Not having annotations isn't a big deal for me because I have three hardcover versions fully annotated and illustrated. Just glad to have the Bard's works in my backpack without impacting a disc in my spine.

B001AQR39O|1.0|This is really a dreadful show.    Hank Moody doesn't have a real job (while seeming to have no financial problems), and attractive women regular throw themselves at him, yet the show expects us to identify with him as a suffering human being.   As far as I can tell, Hank is a middle-aged man with the self-controlled of a ill-behaved twelve-year old boy.    In addition, the characters who surround Hank are just slightly more sympathetic, and most of that would come from having to deal with Hank.    Finally, there's little actual humor in the show.    It's not that I'm being prudish -- there are many things with far stronger sexual content I enjoy -- this is just a real waste of time.    I'm a bit shocked at the largely positive reviews from other Amazon customers -- I can't imagine people would enjoy watching this.
0452289963|4.0|One of the greatest gifts in the world is to be able to take very complex and subtle material and make it understandable to everyone. Anyone who has ever tried this immediately understands what a challenge it is to simplify something without losing the essence of the teaching. No one should be excluded from the Path simply because of where they are along the way. I would imagine that anyone who is familiar with what I'm saying would agree that is what Eckhart Tolle is, in part, attempting to do in 'A New Earth'. I respect that.     I know because that's what I do in my Full Spectrum Coaching practice everyday: Share all the things we should've learned but were never taught about understanding yourself, having deep healthy relationships, and navigating well through the world so you can live happily and successfully.     At the core of so much of our suffering is a lack of real understanding of the ego and its shadow. Eckhart does a nice job of explaining the many ways in which negative aspects of the ego show up in ourselves and in life. Fritz Perls, founder of Gestalt therapy, is often quoted, \\"Nothing changes until it becomes real.\\" How true. A New Earth really helps one to realize (ie: to make real) a very simple and powerful truth: the cause of your suffering is 'you', or rather, your mistaken identity as just an ego. For those who are willing to do the work the rewards are literally more than you can imagine. I've seen the lives of my clients transformed as they apply the ideas that Eckhardt writes about here. Anyone who applies the contents of A New Earth can begin that same kind of transformation.     The only reason I hesitate to give 5 stars is because one needs more than just understanding, one needs a practice or set of skills to engage in order to be able to change through experience. Its the only way. I wish Eckhart had included more of that in this book. Well done.

B003EYVXT6|1.0|I love creepy horror movies that mix in some good science-fiction conceit - like The Fly.  But this nauseating movie queasily offers up a modern Frankenstein story that goes places you don't want to go.  Dren, the hybrid hottie, is inconsistent as a creature - she sometimes looks as real as can be, and at other moments looks like an old-fashioned claymation figure.  There are rare glimmers of wit and comedy (in the naming of the other mutant \\"children\\"; in the film noir performance of the French billionaire fundress) - but nothing ever comes of it. Sure, Adrien Brody has never looked better, but c'mon - the truth is, SPLICE is one big yuck.
B003DZX3SA|4.0|I'm hard pressed to think of an animated film that's as concrete and moving as Beauty and the Beast. It has such incredible magic over it. Audiences felt it, and still do. I first saw it at the age of 5. I am now 24, and Beauty and the Beast has lost none of that zest. That's a hallmark that only the best movies manage.<br /><br />A spoiled prince is cursed to live as a beast until he can earn the love of a girl. His chances look slim until fate brings Belle into his life. A clever girl for whom country life is but too tame and predictable, she agrees to be the Beast's prisoner if he will let her father, a prisoner in his dungeon, released. The road of the two to each other's heart is rocky to say the least, what with the Beast's temper and Belle's sometimes reckless curiosity. But rocky starts have a way of leading to good things. Unfortunately, pig-headed brute Gaston has other plans and is not hesitant to exploit Belle's father to do it.<br /><br />The animation in this movie is incredible. There's a sense of life and, dare I say it, realism that draws out the incredible beauty this medium can produce. The Beast is particularly amazing. Visually, Beauty and the Beast is a triumph. Take the ball room scene, with its sweeping camera shots and the chandelier, with our heroes dancing underneath on a marble floor with gigantic windows.<br /><br />The score, by Alan Menken, is excellent as well. Three of the songs were nominated for Oscars. One of them, the enigmatic title track, won a statue, as well as the score itself. \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", beautifully sung by Angela Lansbury, gives me goosebumps to this day (as indeed does the whole ballroom scene). It even works without the symbolism in the lyrics that you come to detect when you become an adult.<br /><br />There is a certain epic quality around Beauty and the Beast. It is a film without any notable dud elements. All you're left with after the movie ends is a sense of great appreciation for this film existing. Beauty and the Beast is a masterpiece that still thrills and charms the socks off anyone fortunate enough to discover it today, young or old. That's a rarity.<br /><br />Great as the movie is, the picture restoration done here is a complete joke. The colours are all washed-out and ugly. Just look at the Beast's fur; it's nowhere near the shade of brown it should be, but much lighter. It's as if someone put a filter over the whole movie and washed it out, which greatly harms the movie's visuals. For the quality of the movie and the extras, I have to detract a star from that. There's a difference between enhancement and ruining.eauty and the Beast is a masterpiece that still thrills and charms the socks off anyone fortunate enough to discover it today, young or old.

The topic of death has always interested me a great deal (by the way, I don't want a viewing at my funeral, simply cremation will be great).

0439023521|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I think it was amazingly written.     SPOILERS      This book is about a dystopian future where the US is split into 13 districts, rather than states. Every year each district must \\"sacrifice\\" a boy and a girl to go fight to the death in the Hunger Games.     Katniss is a 15 year old girl living in District 12. She is the main provider for her family, since her father's death years ago. On the day that the sacrifices are to be choosen, Katniss's little sister is choosen. Katniss immediately volunteers to take her place. A boy is choosen also, Peeta. Over the course of a week or so, Katniss and Peeta are sent to the Capitol to train, prepare, and get \\"polished\\". Once in the Arena for the Games, Katniss and Peeta split up, until almost the end when the rules are changed. Peeta and Katniss become a team in order to win the Games. Peeta and Katniss pretend to be in love in order to gain more supporters. Once Peeta and Katniss are the final two \\"survivors\\", the Games's officials tell them that they must fight to the death and that only one person can be the winner, which is reversing the rule change made halfway thru the game. After a daring move made by Katniss, the Officials are forced to allow both Peeta and Katniss to be named winners of the Hunger Games.    You are left wondering what will happen next to Peeta and Katniss. Will their faux romance become real for Katniss as it is for Peeta? Will there be reprecussions for Katniss's action?
B003TVMIDO|2.0|This box set is such a shameless money-grab from Yoko, who first sold us her re-mixes of John's work eight years ago, and is now trying to sell us back the original mixes we already had. The whole idea of a \\"signature box\\" is cheap and laughable - it's just the same old music wrapped up in a new package.  And those home demos were never meant to be released.  They were recorded on very cheap equipment and clearly do not show John at his best, but she seems intent on repackaging and releasing them over and over again.

B002ZG97V0|3.0|First, the animation itself. Technology just keeps getting better, and this is riding the wave. The texture of the owls' feathers, their motion - it all comes together in a beautiful mix.<br /><br />Then there'sthe story. I found it a comfortable mix of familiar ingredients, many of which recall Star Wars: the Yoda-like mentor, treacherous relative, and plucky band out to save their world from the evil empire. As stories go, it's solid craft, no rough edges, but hardly fine art.<br /><br />I'm not in the target demographic, though. When I saw it, families with kids maybe aged 5-8 predominated in the audience, and the story seemed aimed at them. A couple of moments might have a skittish child on edge, but most of it seemed safe adventure with bloodless conflict and an encouraging moral or two somewhere in the background.<br /><br />Other than casting bats as bad guys (I like the little critters), I found it visually arresting, but otherwise forgettable - unless I find myself entertaining a small child for a rainy weekend.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release

Clocking in at 9 inches thick (but only 6 real pages), this monster has the most intricate pop-outs you've every seen. The first pages deal with a particular hero or villain (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Darkseid) while the last page is a real treat. It's a huge pop-up almost a foot tall of the Justice League fighting a ton of super villains! Every one of these is very intricate, and as you can imagine this is rather fragile. You can just open and slam a page shut. You have to make sure the folds and creases fall back in the right places.<br /><br />Each page also has smaller pages that also pop-up as well with more heroes and villains. Perhaps the coolest minor pop-up is an explosion of Hal Jordan and Sinestro as Green Lanterns that opens to Parallax and Sinestro. A close second is Black Manta actually putting on his helmet as you open the page.<br /><br />This is for the collector, not the child. While you can enjoy this with your kids, it's a lot more intricate than anything you'd ever buy for them. It's definitely worth every penny you spend on it though. I hope they continue this trend and offer either a Marvel-themed version, or start to focus on particular heroes like Batman or Green Lantern for an entire book. Highly recommended!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is an excellent program in either standard or high definition. I bought the blue-ray version because all of the reviews said it was a breath-taking experience and was well worth the extra money. I don't think it is. The footage is spectacular, but the hi-def doesn't make it any more spectacular than it already is. If you plan to purchase this series I would have to say go with standard DVD version and you won't be disappointed.
B001FB55MG|3.0|I saw this free, while traveling from point A to point B. It was worth every penny.<br /><br />The premise is cute, that a down-and-outer (not really tha far down or out) tends his niece and nephew for a few days while their wrapped-too-tight mother is out of town. Somewhat at a loss in trying to entertain kids so far from his own free and easy style, he remembers the bedtime stories his father used to improvise when he was little.<br /><br />And so they begin. Job problems fill mind all the time, so elements of that conflict get wrapped in fairy dust and appear in the stories. Everyone goes to sleep happy. The next day, bizarre elements of the story come true. Nah, it's just a strange coincidence. More stories, more coincidences, until the loser believes he has a magical solution to his problems.<br /><br />The magic stays low-key and believable, encouraging viewers to look for their own everyday miracles, and there's a happy ending for everyone who deserves one. An OK story and kid-safe execution make this decent (if forgettable) family amusement. If it's a rainy day and you've seen everything else twice, give it a shot. Just don't get your hopes up too far.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
030745455X|4.0|Given the tremendous popularity of the Millennium Series, this review is, I'm sure, doomed to sink as quickly as Jimmy Hoffa into Amazon's abyss. But still, I'd just like to add my voice to the chorus of acclaim for the books. They all offer an involved and engaging plot along with a set of complex characters that, for whatever reason, you have to root for.<br /><br />I would also say, for readers just coming to this book, that The Girl Who Played with Fire is a little different creature than The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. While that one was first and foremost a murder mystery/thriller, this one plays out a little more like a spy novel. The first book reminded me somewhat of a Thomas Harris novel, the second and third more like John Le Carre's books. Additionally, The Girl Who Played with Fire really functions with The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest as a single, long novel. That means two things: (1) This one has a slower-paced beginning that serves as the exposition for the longer plot that's really being set into place. So, I guess this one drags, in that section, more than any point in the other two novels, but I think it's all worth it. (2) You should just go ahead and by The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest because you'll probably need to pick it up to continue reading the moment that this one's completed.<br /><br />And it is well worth reading. This one is a strong read on its own, but it's especially worthwhile for setting up the final novel, which I think is the strongest of the three.
B0035WTE52|4.0|Unfortunately the case was a big banged up, but not enough for me to bother exchanging it.
B000002UUX|5.0|I bought this when it first came out and was blown away by the complexity and amazing skill that was utilized to make this album. One of those albums you can listen to front to back and not be disappointed. Highly recommended
B0043JDUNS|1.0|You cannot burn this to a DVD if you buy it from Unbox. DRM prevents your true ownership.
B003BW0CB6|3.0|A very pedestrian effort by the best mystery writer in America.  It almost seemed like Part 1 of a series--very many loose ends.  None of the main characters were developed as they've been in previous novels.  The plot was very predictable, and the climax was anti-climatic.  Disappointing.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This is for grownups.     A fantastic, innovative, New Zealand production that doesn't seem to have 5 minutes of \\"bullcrap\\" or filler.    This is meant to depict the raw brutality and politics of Ancient Rome in as a historically realistic way as possible.     No niceties. It always needs to be understood about the brutality of Rome and not forget about the brutality of slavery.  If this is too raw for you, fine, don't watch it and watch a fairytale like the movie \\"Gladiator\\", from a few years ago.    If you love great innovative filmaking, top shelf acting and raw, in your face truth and honest, then as Jack Nicholson DIDN'T say, \\"You CAN handle the truth\\".     The action scenes in the arena were unreal. There is nothing glamorous about the raw violence where the Roman's would put be brutally be entertained by watching the blood of slave against slave in the arena. That as well as how slaves were used for their own gratuitous sexuality.   Great insights into the politics and power brokering that went on in Rome and unfortunately has become just as ruthless in our current society.     I CAN'T wait for season two.     Jon
B001E45XT4|5.0|Okay so... I read all the comments about this headset before I purchased it; and I was a little leary. BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING MISTER or MISSES or YOU GENDER NEUTRAL PERSON!<br />THIS IS A GREAT PIECE OF HARDWARE!<br />I have used it for 4 hour gaming sessions and watching movies.<br />It is quite comfortable on the large noggin and the sound quality is great.<br />This is my first part of Closed-Ear headphone and let me tell you something. When the kids come a cryin' or the wife wants to talk about the neglected state of the kitchen, i have to remove them to hear the conversation over the sniper bullets wizzing by my head... ORRRR I just continue to lay down covering fire as if I can't hear anything.<br />The mic works great. Love how it stows away for non-chat games or movie.<br />Very comfortable... OH OH OH... the head phone are not your typical plasto-leatherly feeling material. They are more like a soft felt. So there is no temperature discomfort for prolonged use. No sticking to your skin or sweating.<br />The cord is nice and heavy so it feels pretty durable.<br />The only thing that may feel cheap to you is the volume wheel, but it does its job. I rarely adjust the volume from there since I have volume control on the keyboard.<br />So my only gripe is... errr... ahhh... that I'm not getting PAID to write this review.<br />BUY THE DARN THING ALREADY!!! Click it now... click it now... you know you want too. You won't be disappointed.<br />PEACE!
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|As an avid fan of Satriani since the 80's and owning all his albums, I have to say this has become one of my new faves.  After just a listen or two, it was clear to me this is a new sound.  The use of Vai's Mike Keneally on keys adds a richness to Joe's sound never present before.  And while Joe's playing sounds more like the classic Joe riffs and solos of his early work, the songwriting's riffs & blues/jazz grooves with the keyboards give off a 70's vibe at times; no doubt his latest writing with Chickenfoot gave him some of the retro influences.  Nice variance of style from the higher energy pieces like Premonition to the funky wah groove of Dream Song (which he actually dreamed and then wrote/played the next morning) to the more tender delicate sounds of Solitude and nostalgia of his childhood home on Littleworth Lane.  Great album through and through!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This movie definitely added something that had been missing in the other two movies. It had character history and answered so many questions that needed to be answered. It had action and romance well throughout the entire movie and it didn't get cheesy or overdone. Hope that Breaking Dawn can be as good!
B003NS0PT2|5.0|An unusual episode, as it is very different from all previous episodes, yes-- but I cannot agree with the previous reviewer that there is nothing here to watch.  Quite the opposite.<br /><br />This episode feels very much like a well-crafted one-act play.  We see subtle changes in both Walt and Jesse, brilliantly unfolding thanks to masterful performances.  Walt's moral compromises, the blurring of his values, the crushing consequences of his actions and choices, all converge upon him, bending together like light waves brought to a searing point by a gigantic lens.  We see the evolution of both characters, terrible and wonderous.  Breaking Bad breaks all the rules, and one cannot help but marvel.
0679746323|5.0|This book is a must for anyone interested in the modern history of China. The detail and documentation are phenomenal. If you are not at all familiar with Chinese geography, history or names it will be a little hard to follow but you have to start somewhere.

B003UYUQZW|2.0|Once upon a time, hollywood types thought that it would be fun to film a movie in a desert situation with camels and sand and dirt and turbins and they were horribly wrong. What happened with the movie Ishtar is sort of what happened here with PRINCE OF PERSIA. Sure, the movies are two completely different things. ISHTAR was a comedy set in the desert and people didn't get it. It was long and boring. PRINCE OF PERSIA had a better shot at success because it was based on a video game, which are FUN and FAST and EXCITING.  PRINCE OF PERSIA has moments of FUN, but it is never fast or even close to being EXCITING.<br /><br />PRINCE OF PERSIA was stunning in the sense that a video game movie that had so much potential, became a talk fest DRAMA before you realize what happened. The movie starts off with much promise. In fact, early on, I was involved and thinking that I thought the movie had been misjudged and that it wasn't that bad.  Then the drama started and the action disappeared like a gust of sand in the wind.<br /><br />Before I realized it, I was disconnected from the film that had become a long series of talking heads and soap opera drama. I was reading. Playing on the internet. Doing dishes. Thinking about what movie I could watch next that would guarantee me the intense involvement that I was hoping to get with PRINCE OF PERSIA.... and didn't.<br /><br />The creators of PRINCE OF PERSIA dropped the ball. The screenplay was lacking flair and creativity, which is consequently the exact opposite of what you get with the ground-breaking highly creative video game.<br /><br />For all intensive purposes, I should give the movie 1 star, but I reserve 1's for real stinkers and 5's for real gems. It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen. It was just boring.
B00198X0WW|5.0|\\"The Mission\\" is, like 1984's \\"The Bounty\\", one of a select few eighties films that is far from forgotten, but still remains somewhat underrated by modern film fans nonetheless. I was attracted to both on DVD years ago because of their incredible cast list, and was amazed to find both are among the finest films released that decade. \\"The Mission\\" stars Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, and Liam Neeson in a deeply compelling and visually stunning tale of a Jesuit missionary trying to indoctrinate natives in South America during the mid-1700s. A detailed synopsis can be found elsewhere, so for the purposes of brevity I'm going to focus on the transfer and special features.<br /><br />Only mere moments into the film I was already impressed with the gorgeous transfer. I've watched the DVD recently and this is a significant upgrade in terms of image quality. Fine detail is overall excellent and the colors are much more vibrant. Quite simply, it both looks and sounds absolutely wonderful. With certain catalog titles I've found that the Blu doesn't offer the \\"best possible quality\\", but rather the \\"best available quality\\", for various reasons. In the case of \\"The Mission\\", I feel we are truly presented with the best possible quality. I didn't notice any blatant instances of artificial enhancement or otherwise distracting errors during the film. I'd give the transfer an easy 4.5 out of 5.<br /><br />The back of the case indicates that all of the features from the DVD have been ported over to the Blu, which includes: a commentary track by director Roland Joffe, the hour-long vintage documentary \\"Omnibus\\", and the theatrical trailer. Joffe's commentary is par for the course, he makes some curious observations and tells some interesting anecdotes. The \\"Omnibus\\" documentary is fascinating and nice to see here, but it is unfortunately presented in standard definition and it's looking seriously rough. As in, old VHS tape rough. Still, it's well worth watching, because it functions not just as a making-of piece but provides insight into how the film crew interacted with the Waunana Indians. Unfortunately, I simply could not locate the theatrical trailer on the disc.<br /><br />It would've been nice to have seen a contemporary piece on the film, much like the one the \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" Blu-Ray received, but this is something of a niche title and so the exclusion of such is understandable. In summation, the image quality of the documentary is lamentable, and they either forgot to include or maliciously hid the theatrical trailer, but the film itself looks crystal clear beautiful. In the end, that's why you're interested in this disc to begin with. \\"The Mission\\" comes highly recommended.<br /><br />Audio - DTS-HD Master Audio: English 5.1 & Dolby Digital: French 2.0<br />Subtitles - English SDH, French, Spanishing-of piece but provides insight into how the film crew interacted with the Waunana Indians.

0312600844|1.0|Oprah recommended this book and I had already checked it out as a possible download on my Nook.  Ok.  I will give it a try.  NOT WORTH ANYONE'S TIME.  This is wordy, disjointed and  pretty much sucks.  I read A LOT of book...all kinds.  I was surprised that someone, like Oprah, who might be a fairly busy person, would take the time to WADE through this and still hail it as a GREAT read!  (Thought she might have a stroke while she was recommending this book on her show.) The dialogue, when it takes place, is okay, but it seldom takes place!   When anyone in this story has a thought, it takes twelve, or more pages to get through their thought, which is lengthy, boring, distracting...these characters literally bury themselves in thinking.  I am over halfway thru this mess, and determined to make it thru. There is no compelling reason in this story to even care about these people.  As well read and as intelligent as I am, I don't think I could even communicate with MYSELF with these detailed and boring thoughts.  IT IS A HORRIBLE BOOK!!!!!!  Don't bother. (You can actually skip pages and pages and pages.)
B001AQR39O|5.0|different from the first season but still one of my favorite shows. can't wait for 3
B002ZG97EC|4.0|In the beginning of DESPICABLE ME, the premise of the movie went straight over my kids heads. They couldn't put their minds around the fact that the lead character, GRU, was a thief of not money, or jewels, or cars, but of HUGE NATIONAL MONUMENTS like THE PYRAMIDs of Egypt. For the first 20 minutes of the film, I was under the impression that DESPICABLE ME just might be a miss on the kids likeability factor.<br /><br />Then, the heavy premise of the film sort of changed. Once GRU, sets his sights on a theft that most evil nemesis' would be proud of and no BOND VILLAIN would ever dream of, the movie returned to the fool-proof method of getting through to kids... it became FUN. It became light and the characters involved started having fun and then the movie did something even better, it attempted to touch our hearts by inserting Margo, Edith & Agnes, three orphans who have given up on adoption and are just intent on being there for each other.<br /><br />So when GRU seems an opportunity to use the 3 orphans to assist in his planned large scale heist, he adopts the kids and the movie ceased being just any ordinary film. It became something tangible and fun and something that the audience could relate to.<br /><br />On a side note, as funny as Steve Carell's GRU was, Jason Segel's character, VECTOR, was an absolute stitch. A squirrly little supervillain who competes with GRU to see who can pull off the biggest heist and get the biggest credit from the crime world, and most importantly please his crime boss father.<br /><br />DESPICABLE ME is an absolute must for any collection because this movie was overshadowed at the box office, but will only get better with time. Five years from now, DESPICABLE ME will still be unique, creative and unforgettable.
888370536X|3.0|This product was almost what I was looking for, I didn't find anywhere in the details that gave dimensions so unfortunately they were the wrong item.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Love the characters, and their interaction one w/the other, and all the space age mumbo-jumbo.  There is always something going on to make you laugh out loud!
B003PIUC02|5.0|This show is amazing.  I started watching it thinking it was just going to be like 300 - I was wrong.  The show is like a movie, but with more twists and turns as the story develops.  Enough blood, violence, sex, drama, etc for anyone! Definitely a must-see show.<br /><br />PS: The Blu-Ray is amazing.  Great picture and great sound.  Comes in a 4-disc set with TONS of extra features as well as extended episodes just for the Blu-ray release!  This is worth every penny.

0345505387|1.0|Sorry Diana, but as a devoted fan of the Outlander series, I just can't get behind this graphic novel. Others have already described my thoughts in detail, but some of the basics are: Characters look way too much alike, even after multiple reads I don't know who is speaking in a couple frames. Kenneth storyline came out of absolutely no where... and was pointless. One question: Since when does Claire have DDs? (I have read that this was done to attract the young male reader... I guess someone forgot that the target audience of this series is women? I found the chest to be obnoxious and ridiculous). Jamie's scars are missing in a scene- pretty big thing to be left out. But mostly, I felt it made the books into nothing but a superficial joke- complete with scenes containing SPLOOSH, and WOO!. Positive: The landscape artwork was lovely... Overall, I suggest picking it up from the library first.
044654759X|2.0|I had trouble finishing this book. In fact, I skipped several chapters and read the ending... knowing exactly how it would end. As others have said - 'it reminds me of Sleeping with the Enemy'. Pretty boring.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I do not intend on promoting capitalism when suggesting people should purchase this blu-ray but they should. BBC have created a marvellous 11 50 minute episodes of sheer splendour and entetainment. Each episode is constanlty fascinating and intensely interesting to watch and learn about this real world we live in but most of us do not see. In some cases in caves stretching miles beneath the earth and cavities stretched within the deepest most uninhibitable places on earth not many people in the hstory of the world have seen until the BBC got there. My favourite episodes would have to be the first episode, the one about underwater caves, ice worlds and shallow seas but really they all deserve about 4-5 stars each. I believe this would be an excellent documentary to show to all children as it is very educational. In pristine, breathtaking 1080i Full High Defintion this is a great show case which could easily spark children's interest in science and geography.      I hope no one is fooled because this is a documentary, because I have seen many documentaries like this and March of the Penguins which are as entertaining as 5 star movies like North by Northwest.   I definetly recommend this blu-ray wholeheartedly.  Thank you BBC,  Thank you David Attenborough  Thank you amazon.com for the exceptionally fast shipping and bargain prices    note: Also I heard there was a new blu-ray vesion of Planet Earth available that has a special features, so you might want to consider that. Although I think there may be other narrators for other versions of this series but I personally like David Attenborough's narration which is awe-inspiring. I doubt other narrators could have done a better job but I haven't listened to them so I am not in a postion to compare. This was my first global network online review, I am just a begginer reviewer and I hope you liked it.
030745455X|4.0|The book was riveting, as advertised. I definitely stayed up late just to get through a few more chapters. I'll also have to get the last book in the trilogy. I can't leave it sitting here. I saw the movie version of \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo\\", which prompted me to read this, the second book in the trilogy. Now I have to complete it by reading The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest. I can't wait for the rest of the movies to come out to find out what ultimately happens.
B001USHRCK|5.0|I bought this Lego set for my husband for Christmas (yes, my husband, big boys like Legos too), and we had a lot of fun putting it together.  I was a medieval history major in college, which is why this set appealed to me, and the fun little details amused me, like the blacksmith's shop with its \\"water powered\\" hammer, and the cooked turkey with its removable legs.  Some of the segments were a little tricky to put together, so I would definitely recommend this set for older kids, but all in all, we both loved it.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|While Season Five of the fabulous Forensic Crime Comedy/Drama, \\"Bones\\" doesn't offer a unique 'forties'-style film noir finale (the Season Four final episode was in a brilliant class by itself), in many ways, Season Five has been the most enjoyable, entertaining season, yet, and I can offer five GREAT reasons why you need it in your DVD library!<br /><br />1. The Plotlines: Psychics, mysterious couriers, prodigies, neighborhood wars, chicken-men, dwarf wrestlers...victims, suspects, and witnesses seldom get more fascinating than on \\"Bones\\", and this only covers the first half-dozen episodes of the season! Motives are frequently unexpected, even weapons can be surprising! Superior writing has always set this show apart, and this season is no exception...from an Egyptian Pharaoh, to an alien (the flying saucer kind), to yet another dead Santa, to a JFK autopsy, there's never a dull corpse for the Bones team!<br /><br />2. The Chemistry: It's easy to take it for granted that a beautiful girl and hunky guy starring in a long-running series will be bedmates after a season or two (many shows even advertise the sex more than the storylines), but \\"Bones\\" creator, Hart Hanson, knows that the electricity between Brennan and Booth works best because their attraction is (as yet) unfulfilled. It gives their friendship a wry humor and wisdom much more mature than most TV couples share. But if you want more sexuality, \\"Bones\\" Season Five has it, too, with the frequently carniverous relationship between intern Daisy, and shrink, Sweets, and, my favorite couple, artist Angela, and bug-guy, Hodgins (which takes a FABULOUS turn in Season Five, that had me cheering!) And for balance, there is beautiful Cam, dealing with motherhood issues with a strong-willed teen, and sarcastic, wise Caroline, who sees and understands EVERYTHING, and impatiently waits for everybody else to catch up! Add Booth's matchmaking grandpa, an appearance by Brennan's ex-con dad, and the other terrific rotating interns to the mix (Wendall even has a fling with Angela!), and this is a recipe that can't be beat...<br /><br />3. The Humor: Every episode has at least one very funny subplot, as well as the constant stream of one-liners; among my Season Five favorites are Booth beating up the midget wrestler in the ring (while being booed!), Brennan's High School reunion (a near-parody of every high school slasher film), with guest star 'Freddy Kruger', himself, Robert Englund, a very amusing flashback of the very first case of Booth and the 'Squints' (with the welcome return of Eric Millegan as Zack Addy), and another episode with a very funny subplot of the guys waiting in line for tickets to \\"Avatar\\" (even funnier because Joel Moore, playing intern Colin Fisher, is actually in the film!)...<br /><br />4. Returning Villains: One of the BEST series' villains, the Gravedigger, returns (and in a logical context, at the trial), in one of the scariest episodes of the entire series...I was actually shook, watching it, expecting something horrible as a resolution! Bravo!<br /><br />5. The Season Finale: Beautiful and bittersweet, with so many loose ends tied up that many series' fans were actually afraid that the series itself was ending! Will Cam be left alone, as everyone ponders leaving the Jeffersonian to fulfill their own dreams? I loved it!<br /><br />Season Five is simply awesome! Don't wait five more minutes, buy it! :)mix (Wendall even has a fling with Angela!), and this is a recipe that can't be beat...    3.

B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Bruno Mars literally sprung up out of nowhere this year when he appeared on B.O.B.'s hit single Nothin On You.  He had an undeniably smooth voice with a unique quality that made him instantly likable.  I will admit that Bruno Mars does show flashes of Michael Jackson in his voice in the same type of way that Ne-Yo has some shades of MJ in his voice.  This is not to say he sings or sounds like Michael, just that certain notes he hits reminds of the late great.  However that little quality did not cause me to overrate this album.  Bruno Mars is extremely talented and is a star waiting to happen.    Having also appeared on Travie McCoy's successful single Billionaire as well as helping produce the magnificent Cee-Lo Green single \\"F You\\", Bruno finally drops his much anticipated album.  Earlier he released a 4 song EP \\"Its Better If You Don't Understand\\" which was a great record.  However, 3 of those 4 songs made it to his debut album Doo Wops & Hooligans.  That would not be so bad if the album was longer than 10 tracks.  It's still not really a problem since the album is filled with great songs.  The single Just The Way You Are is 5 stars all the way as well as Grenade, Talking To The Moon and Lazy Song.  Bruno Mars mixes soul with reggae and pop but does so effortlessly and with such style and grace.  Vocally he's one of the best male singers to emerge in quite a while and the production is timeless.  The lyrics are original and sung with passion. Cee-Lo Green, B.O.B., and Damian Marley make cameos but Bruno was not outshined on his own project.    Doo Wops & Hooligans is easily one of the better albums of the year.  I'd rank it up there with Janelle Monae, Nneka, and Corinne Bailey Rae's efforts.  It's unfortunate that Bruno Mars has encountered a bit of trouble as this album was released but it's easy to see he has the talent to be a cornerstone in music for years to come. 5 stars.
B003ZJJFKE|4.0|Satch has been up and down many roads over the years, and you can never really tell exactly what he's going to do on his next release. I am usually able to hear the soul in most of his albums, even if I'm initially disappointed (see Engines of Creation). Still, his last few albums have left me very disappointed. This is a trend that began with \\"Strange Beautiful Music\\", an album that I liked but which felt like a step down after his masterpiece \\"Crystal Planet\\". Successive releases have done little to make me feel any better. \\"Is there Love in Space?\\" was underwhelming. \\"Super Colossal\\" more of the same. \\"Professor Satchafunkilus, etc.\\" was another step in the wrong direction. My hopes were not high for this one but I was presently surprised. This actually feels like a \\"step up\\" for the first time since \\"Crystal Planet\\". Is it as good? No. Is it better than anything he's done since? I can unequivocally say YES. It's been spinning non-stop in my car and on my computer ever since release. If you don't like it on first listen, give it a chance. The keyboard flourishes give it an almost prog feel at certain points, which I don't think is a bad thing. Still, if you dislike some of the artistic experiments here, just give it a few listens. After a few spins, those little changes have a way of fading into the background, providing nothing more than a little textural change.

1401324029|4.0|Quick prelude -- for anyone who isn't aware, the 'author' Richard Castle is a fictional character from the tv series Castle on ABC.  So don't spend any time looking for Derrick Storm books - they don't exist.  In the tv series, Richard Castle, a book writer, teams up with a group of NYPD detectives and writes the Nikki Heat series.  ABC and Hyperion publishing haven't revealed the real author of the books, that I'm aware of.    As for Naked Heat itself -- it's a good mystery.  Most of the book you are following through the eyes of either Nikki Heat, the NYPD detective, or Jameson Rook, the writer; with a few brief pages following Heat's partners, Raley and Ochoa.  Some people may not like the switching viewpoints, but it works here.  The story isn't done in the style of Agatha Christie, in that you're expected to pick of subtle clues throughout the narrative on your own; but rather, you learn what the the major characters learn.  Which frankly, is a much more satisfying read, for me, than Christie's style.    The story starts out with Nikki Heat responding to one murder, and then almost immediately being pulled off onto a higher profile murder of a well-known gossip columnist.  We are then brought through the mystery of interlocking crimes, red herrings, witness interviews, and detective work.  The majority of the story is well written and enjoyable.  There is one part early in the book where you're astounded that the crime solvers don't follow up on what the reader will obviously pick up as a clue, but goes right over the head of everyone in the story.  In avoiding spoilers, I won't get into any more detail - but I do wish the author had written that section a little better.  The 'clue' is dismissed pretty cavalierly.    As for comparing this book to the prior novel - Heat Wave...  it's a much more satisfying read.  For one thing, it's nearly 100 pages longer than the first outing; so the story can be that much more intricate and satisfying.  The first book was really a toe in the water to see if customers would bite; and since they did, we've now been given a full-length story to enjoy.    Why not 5 stars, since I obviously enjoyed the book?  Well, it's a good mystery, but not a great mystery.  The 'missed clue' I mentioned before is a little jarring, and the pacing of the book was a bit off.  The first section of the book picks up the pace really well - so much so in fact, that I thought I was nearing point where the crime would be solved, only to look at the number of pages I had remaining to realize that I was only half way through the novel.  And soon after this, the pace slows down and you do have a bit of a dead spot in the narrative where not much progress is made.  While this certainly well portrays what could be a lack of progress in a true to life investigation, it is a bit annoying to see the narrative slow down so much before it picks up the pace again.    As for my last thoughts on the book...  I think it was a pretty good decision on ABC's part to develop this series.  And that's because this series solves a dilemma for ABC.  In all tv series where there is that smoldering love interest between the two main characters, the producers have to decide when, or even if, the romance will ever come to fruition.  With this series, I think ABC will sidestep that decision.  I don't think we'll ever see Richard Castle and Kate Beckett ever become a real couple.  By having Rook and Heat have a sexual relationship in the books, they're basically telling viewers of the series who want to see that happen to go here, to the books, for their fix.  The producers of Castle can now keep that tension going indefinitely and not risk going the way of Moonlighting - which lost a lot of its magic after the characters became a 'real couple'.
B003HGKJ3W|5.0|Firstly, I must say that a-ha are one of my all-time fave bands, and \\"Scoundrel Days\\", their second album from 1986, is one of my desert-island discs...could be their best album.  I used to have this album on vinyl...not tape...and I remember just staring at that cover for hours, that beautiful landscape.  The original CD messed with that for some reason, and the US deluxe reissue is like the original CD just in digiopack form...THIS import version recaptures the original vinyl, which I prefer.<br /><br />The liner notes inside are well-written and historical, capturing the details in what made this album what it is...what was shocking was that \\"Scoundrel Days\\" was done on the fly, while on a worldwide tour...much of it was recorded in Australia.  There is an adventurousness, I guess, that mirrors these on-the-go sessions...and things worked out the way they did...the WB guys had no choice but to keep the album as-is because a-ha couldn't simply go back and \\"fix\\" it to their liking and they were one \\"hot\\" band, so they had to bite their lip.  I am really happy they did because the album is pretty perfect, full of pop melody; adventurous, uncommercial textures, a darker centre, a human warmth, a beautiful sequence, the kitten kaboodle.  And listening to this record 24 years later, it sounds just as grand, exciting and timeless...it doesn't sound dated at all, which is an accomplishment in itself...it should have won some Grammys...\\"Scoundrel Days\\" proved that, yes, a-ha were not some trendy, here today-gone tomorrow, laughable, forgettable prettyboys...no, a-ha were capable of making timeless, artful, original, melancholic, emotional, adventurous, creative, progressive, melodic pop music with wonderful textures and feels.<br /><br />STILL, the opening 2 tracks...the sublime title track and \\"Swing Of Things\\" are among the greatest 1-2 punches in all of pop music history...and I wonder why those 2 songs were never singles???  Yet both are included in a-ha's new 2CD anthology \\"25\\" as fan faves and shoulda-been singles.  \\"I've Been Losing You\\" was a great single that still gets played on VH1's Lifestyles shows...\\"October\\" is an atmospheric wonder...\\"Manhattan Skyline\\" is an epic rocker with a great riff and a sense of both optimism and dread.  \\"Cry Wolf\\", the second single...where is the album's \\"Take On Me\\"??  There it is!!...then the last 4 tracks...\\"We're Looking For The Whales\\", \\"The Weight Of The Wind\\", \\"Maybe Maybe\\" and \\"Soft Rains Of April\\"...in 1986 I didn't get them completely but still listened...NOW, with this new remaster...I GET them now...they fit perfectly and are awesomely realized creations, with highs and emotional lows...perfection.<br /><br />NOW the bonuses...at the end of disc 1 are the three 12\\" versions...of \\"I've Been Losing You\\", \\"Cry Wolf\\" and \\"Manhattan Skyline\\"...AWESOME...and I believe they were previously also released on the EP \\"Scoundrel Club\\"...there were 4 EPs like that...\\"45 RPM Club\\", \\"12 Inch Club\\", \\"Scoundrel Club\\" and \\"Road Club\\"...I had 45, 12\\" and Roadm, never \\"Scoundrel Club\\" so it's great to have these 12 inches.<br /><br />Then Disc 2 consists of an alternate demo version of the album, all 10 tracks, and it's as great as the released album we all love, but just as interesting and cool...a fave is the rockier take on \\"Swing Of Things\\" with that great riff, and also nice is the \\"Guitar Version\\" of \\"Soft Rains Of April\\"...really pretty.  Then the B-side of the original version of \\"This Alone Is Love\\"...which was rerecorded for \\"Stay On These Roads\\"...I think I like this original one better...then the 1986-era demo of \\"Days On End\\" which is cool with that \\"horn\\" section and an interesting song...it was on the accompanying disc with the 2004 book \\"The Swing Of Things\\"...then 5 songs from a concert in Croydon, England (hometown of the late great Kirsty MacColl)...which is awesome and full of energy amd even humour...Mags, the band's between-song MC/mouthpiece, is hilarious!!!<br /><br />Anyhoo...this reissue is the best one ever, since the deluxe of Def Leppard's \\"Hysteria\\"...I still need the deluxe of \\"Hunting High & Low\\", the new collection \\"25\\" and I hope there will be more deluxes of \\"Stay On These Roads\\", \\"East Of The Sun, West Of The Moon\\", and \\"Memorial Beach\\"...maybe a DVD/Blu-Ray of all vidclips, the \\"Live In South America\\" concert (plus extras/unreleased), and all else...a live album from the farewell tour???<br /><br />I'm happy with the a-ha interest, and remember, bands like Coldplay would not exist if not for a-ha...they are innovators!!nce the deluxe of Def Leppard's \\"Hysteria\\"...I still need the deluxe of \\"Hunting High & Low\\", the new collection \\"25\\" and I hope there will be more deluxes of \\"Stay On These Roads\\", \\"East Of The Sun, West Of The Moon\\", and \\"Memorial Beach\\"...maybe a DVD/Blu-Ray of all vidclips, the \\"Live In South America\\" concert (plus extras/unreleased), and all else...a live album from the farewell tour???

B003INBOEM|4.0|IP Man movie was great as expected. Beware buying the blu-ray version as it does NOT work on some blu-ray players. I had an issue when it would not get to the Main DVD Menu, all the trailers played but could not get to the Menu Option (Play etc.). I thought something was wrong with the DVD and returned it for replacement (great job Amazon).  But when replacement had same problem I contact Panasonic as I thought it was bad but Panasonic WAS aware of th issue with that title. To get past the menu, ie, to play the movie I had to press \\"1\\" on the remote to play \\"2\\" for Special Features, etc.  Otherwise movie itself is great.
B00402FGE4|5.0|First off let me say that I LOVE SG1 and I liked well enough Atlantis.  That being said, this is vastly different.  This is NOT the stargate you grew up with.  This show is for a much older, mature audience.  It's not silly (though one character does bring in a little lighhearted comedy here and there).  It offers up and requires deeper thought provoking ideas, the lines between good and evil are not so black and white, the characters you start out respecting as stand firm good guys have thier moments of weakeneses that may shock you, yet you understand their inner turmoil.  And those you start out not trusting, you grow to love and respect, and towards the end of season one have a connection to each character, there are things you will love and hate about each of them, just as you do people in real life.      This is what is might be like for a group of people, some military, some civilians, to be thrust together far away from everything they know, and must learn to rely on each other for survival in the unkown...    Excellent series so far.  I hope they can keep it up.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This was my first time reading Donoghue & I was left wanting more. I'm an avid reader & it takes a lot to hold my interest & surprise me, but i was hooked on pg 1! Jack as narrator was brilliantly executed. As a mother of 3 boys I found Jack's voice believable & realistic. I was enthralled with the dynamic relationship of Jack & &#34;Ma&#34; & their dependance on one another in two different kinds of prison. One with 4 walls & the other with millions. Great book! Can't wait to read more from Donoghue!

The film is in English.
0920668372|2.0|I do not like this book.  Don't hate it, but I don't like it, either.  This is my mother's favorite children's book, and I vividly recall her reading it to me for the first time when I was 3 years old.  It was very distressing because I didn't want to think about my mother dying AND because my mom always cried when she read it- didn't like that, either!  My older brother felt the same way.  Young kids aren't good at differentiating between sad tears and happy/emotional tears.  Every once in a while I would let her read it because I knew she liked it, but I did not at all.  Do you really want your child to feel like they have to submit to something that distresses them just because they want to make you happy?  Also now that I'm adult, I too find the whole \\"creeping into adult son's bed\\" disturbing.  I didn't pick up on that as a child (and I doubt most children would), but it's the final nail in the coffin for this book in my mind.
0312600844|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel.  I read it non-stop for about a week and enjoyed most of it very much.  I do not think that Freedom is a great novel or a soon to be classic, however.  One more thing:  I was really taken aback by Joey's fantasy of eating his girlfriend's bowel movement. This was going way, way too far. While there's much more to this book than this, this line did color my experience of the book--and, obviously, not in a good way.  Still, I can't imagine why the editor allowed it to be included.  If there's a good explanation for this, I'd be interested to hear it. I can't help but think that this was a mistake. Bottom line for me is this could have been cut and no one would have known the difference.  It simply was not necessary. Don't judge the book by a single line, however. It was, for the most part, a really good, enjoyable read.
0691142165|2.0|The title of this book on the library shelf stuck a cord.  How often we hear that statement.  I did not know of the authors, but appreciated their very clearly stated intention to research historic data in order to add to the body of knowledge concerning the trade cycle.  I think they succeeded, at least to some extent.  I found the tables and graphs interesting and was in awe of the extent of their work, most of it in quite recent times.  They use the book title facetiously, but I think the present economic correction is really a bit more complex than a simple comparison of two depressions.  The outcomes are likely to be vastly different.  The Great United States Inflation and Credit Expansion (my title) starting in 1914, encompasses the authors' First Great Contraction of 1929-1932 as well as their Second Great Contraction they identify as occurring in 2007, but probably began in 2000.    It took a few days to digest, but after finishing the book, I concluded that the authors are thoroughly Keynesian.  Reading the kudos on Amazon.com from famous men like Bernanke, Krugman, and other Keynesian reviewers quickly dispelled any doubts I may have had about their economic philosophy.  I began to understand why they limited the scope of the book to mostly the publication of a low-resolution database.  The authors probably could not analyze the genesis of the periodic monetary contractions because their understanding in economic theory is still developing.      They apparently still believe government needs to take control of every nation's money - on a world scale - to keep that awful unstable market economy on an even keel.  They believe that government can manage the economy to maintain a happy bit of inflation with just enough newly printed money to have a buzz on all the time.  Then, if somehow a crisis should occur, government will develop the correct policy, which means upping that same feel good medication that started it in order to correct the nasty depressing affair.  Such thinking is similar to that of managing the extent of a pregnancy of unknown origin and being surprised when a crisis develops and childbirth occurs.  The participants have no inkling of their having precipitated and then nurtured the crisis from the time of its start to its fruition.  Nor have they any suspicion that the phenomenon of childbirth/economic collapse, which the authors call a crisis, is really the correction back to normal conditions.  They believe the economic crash is the root of the problem when it is actually the result of their policy of conjuring money and credit from thin air.  An honest analysis must show by their own research how wrong they have been.    Drs. Reinhart and Rogoff, as part of the mainstream economists who commonly move back and forth between academia and government office, must be extremely embarrassed when viewing the record of managing the United States economy for the last century.  Professional economists should have noticed the illiquid expansion of credit growing each year since 1947.  I hope for all of our sakes the field of economics has progressed far enough for them to be a little frightened at having been a party to the expansion of unknown trillions of illiquid dollars & credit in the U. S. alone.  We now see estimates of one quadrillion excess dollars in the world economy.  We are on the cusp of a correction the size of which, in the past, has destroyed currencies and restructured political systems.  I am dismayed to discern little discussion of the only way out, which is to let the system work out the distortions with a crash, let the greedy take their licks, and let us get on with market lending where the lenders are forced, by the market, to take responsibility for proper conduct.  Placing responsibility on government has never worked in the past, is not working now, and can never work in the future.    Once President Roosevelt turned our currency into fiat money, the handwriting was on the wall.  Itwas only a matter of time.  Governments will always manage money in such a way that the system eventually fails.  In our case, it took 97 years for our government to grow so large and misallocate funds so badly that economic growth has slowly stopped.  The result is having no growth to cover even the interest on the overhanging debt.  Without a continually increasing economy growth rate to supply the ever-increasing need for credit, the economy must collapse.  Deflation must occur.  Government printing presses have so far been unable to re-inflate the economy this time even with the 2.46 trillion already injected.  Where this mess goes now, under the present mismanagement is anyone's guess.    It appears the authors prefer the political solution of government control rather than developing solutions designed to let the market economy work.  I hope mainstream economists learn soon that the 'Barbarous Relic', gold, is the only non-inflatable money that prevents eventual destruction of the economy.  Only the market itself contains the seeds of correction in an economic crisis.  Government managers have much higher priorities than a smoothly functioning and growing economy as perhaps is the case for many of our professional economists.  After all, every one of us is on a quest for fame and fortune, and if we can get by with it, counterfeiting is a wonderful way to get your hands on large quantities of money.

0786955554|5.0|Just got my box in the mail. This set contains over a dozen thick card-stock dungeon tiles and rooms for the D&D4 game. Some are reprints of previous dungeon tiles but no matter, this is meant to be a core-set. If you are new to D&D 4 then you should pick this up, it has enough tiles for a modest sized dungeon crawl game. I'll probably pick up a second box set to expand my tile sets. What is excellent about this set is that the box itself is a large sized dungeon room (both lid and box). While I still use a battlemat this is great for adding more atmosphere for specific dungeon encounters. Wizards D&D are really putting out good quality products with this Essentials line. While touted for D&D this set could easily be used for other fantasy RPG games like Warhammer or Pathfinder too.

B002ZG99A4|5.0|This is a hero adventure STRAIGHT out of the 1980s.  You know, before Hollywood set out to pansify men and take away their muscle and give them \\"sparkles\\" (I just threw up in my mouth a little).  In fact, if you were in the 1980s, you would cry on yer pillow to see this film because it would've been the best action movie you have ever seen.  Ok, maybe today we demand a little more intelligence out of our films, but this is still a damn good movie.  And Mickey Rourke raises the whole film 5 notches in acting and made everyone else step up.  Even Dolph Lungren, who is notoriously wooden as an actor, did the best acting job of his life in this film.  He was wonderful, I couldn't believe it was the same guy.  This is one FUN damn film and entertaining all the way through and more action and guns, bullets and flying body parts than anything your Schwarzalloned-mind can remember.  Loved it!
B002W5UVSM|3.0|**Please note**: I am not reviewing the actual book (plot, style, character, etc.) \\"A Confederacy of Dunces,\\" but rather the formatting quality specific to the Kindle edition.  (This is a classic story, and my thoughts on it would not add to the many salient, accurate reviews of its greatness that exist here and elsewhere.)    Put simply, the formatting is very strange.  The font is not the usual Kindle font -- it is much larger, and quite faded/faint.  As you may know, in the printed versions of the book, there are sections where the font is smaller.  On the Kindle, this is fine in full, bright light, but when reading in not so bright light (light that would otherwise be fine for properly formatted books), this will lead to some eye strain and possibly some instances where you may struggle to process the smaller typeface.  These sections of smaller typeface make setting the book to a smaller font on your Kindle inadvisable.       There are also very strange carriage returns that do not coordinate with the printed version, resulting in very large spaces between most paragraphs and even some sentences.  You may find screens that contain only a couple of 2 or 3 sentence paragraphs.  If you are a fast reader, and you are reading on the default (larger in this case) font, this will result in page turn clicks every few seconds, which grow rather annoying over the course of reading the book (especially if you are sitting/lying near someone that is already driven crazy by normal Kindle clicking!).    All in all, though, these issues shouldn't stop you from purchasing the Kindle edition (@ $7.99, it's a bargain relative to some other books).  Just know that you will be clicking more than normal, and, if you often read in lower light settings, you may have some intermittent problems.    [[ASIN:B002W5UVSM A Confederacy of Dunces]]
B00402FGE4|5.0|For those who have watched star trek voyager, I Think Stargate Universe is a direct take from the Star Trek Voyager series, a ship lost in space, two crews working together,a lot of drama, betyal and twists. i think this series (Stargate Universe) is amazing. although it is compleaty different from SG1 and SGA, I Think this is the best. The producers are trying to recreate the series because some feel that after SGA, the Franchise went down. I Don't think the franchise went down i think they did an excellant job reinventing the gate!!!! Again if you like stargate you would either love or hate this series. enjoy
B000UJCALI|3.0|I know this is often considered one of the scariest movies of all time, and I will admit that it has its moments, but good grief, I've never seen a horror film that is so slow to build up to anything remotely scary.  All scenes involving the supernatural are excellently portrayed by the actors, but since I'm rating the film on its overall composition it has to take a hit for all of the cheesy dialogue scenes in the first few scenes.  In particular I have a hard time stomaching the character of Wendy.  I wasn't a fan of her in King's novel either, but at least there she seemed to have some backbone, and I wasn't treated to a visual representation of her 80s \\"fashion\\" -- I mean, I'm not particularly picky about clothes, but enough with the unflattering dresses and red socks, already!  This Wendy looks too meek to even consider locking her husband in a pantry, let alone fending him off with a knife: she can't even remark on how beautiful the hotel looks without sounding like someone in a cheaply made infomercial.  Jack Nicholson didn't do much for me, either (and he really proved how terrible he is at pretending to drive -- rocking the steering wheel back and forth...really?  I've only ever really seen that in B-movies.), until he finally had to  start acting insane, and then I thought he was brilliant.  He really seemed to make the transition from sanity quite abruptly, though -- I think that aspect of the film could have been written out more clearly and more believably.  Also, I'm not sure if Danny Lloyd was actually voicing \\"Tony\\" as well or if he was dubbed, but regardless, the Tony voice was the creepiest part of the movie for me -- I can't even think about \\"redrum\\" without getting chills now.  The ghost scenes were legitimately creepy as well, but all and all I can't say that this film lives up to the title of best horror movie of all time, at least in my book: to do that it would have had to capture my attention from the beginning, and the first 30 or so minutes of The Shining are so tedious that they may prevent some from being willing to view the rest of it.

B00001NFCY|4.0|Uniquely, this album doesn't have a title song and spawned 4 singles: \\"What If,\\" \\"Are You Ready,\\" \\"With Arms Wide Open,\\" and \\"Higher\\" which all had their positions in the Top 10 either on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks or Billboard Hot 100 charts, but the album itself went to #1. \\"With Arms Wide Open,\\" the third video that regarded this album, is spectacular. \\"Say I\\" sounded tempting. Most of the songs are hard on this classic. People say that this was even Creed's greatest album. Produced by John Kurzweg, you get decent lyrics. Otherwise, the album cover is interesting. Mark Tremonti regarded it as meaning self-created chosen ways us men decide upon. The one song that really struck me was the last song, \\"Inside Us All,\\" that has a wonderful but solemn guitar rhythm. You should add to the 11 million plus albums that Creed already sold with this one.

This became the best selling multiple-album of all time with 40 million sold and even received a nomination for Album of The Year. The first disc contains 15 already well known songs from the man off the albums \\"Off The Wall,\\" \\"Thriller,\\" \\"Bad,\\" and \\"Dangerous.\\" Then, you have the second disc that has the opening high-charting duet \\"Scream\\" with Janet Jackson and another 5 singles. \\"They Don't Care About Us\\" was a controversial single that maligns political publicity and credits Martin Luther King Jr. and Roosevelt. \\"Stranger in Moscow\\" has a flambuoyant deep beat with lyrics of being solitary. \\"This Time Around\\" featured the late Notorious B.I.G. and has a serious melody with lyrics about avoiding public control. \\"Earth Song\\" is an inspirational single starting off with a piano and then progresses to a harsh beat; the lyrics deal with general troubles of the world. \\"D.S.\\" is a funny song with guitar from Slash that maligned attorney Tom Sneddon. \\"Money\\" is hot and deals with desperation for cash. \\"Come Together\\" is a stronger remake from the original Beatles song. \\"You Are Not Alone\\" is a single that went into the Guiness Book of World Records as being the first to debut at #1 on Billboard Hot 100. Written by R.Kelly, the hit is slow and basic. \\"Childhood\\" is a song that was contributed to \\"Free Willy 2\\" without a beat that sadly reflected on Michael Jackson's past. \\"Tabloid Junkie\\" is an uplifting song that discourages the public to not always rely on the news for judgment and truth. \\"2 Bad\\" featured lyrics from Shaquille O'Neal and displays annoyance. The nice title track features excerpts from Martin Luther King and obscure vocals from Boyz II Men. \\"Little Susie\\" is sad. \\"Smile\\" is another remake.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Since it's not out yet, I don't own the boxed set but I've seen most of the season and the 11th Doctor surpassed my expectations. Before the season started had my doubts but I think he might actually be better than the last two. This season was extremely good,the best since Eccelston's awesome run. He's a fun doctor, more care free than the last few. He may be one of the best! Stephen Moffat is also doing a great job as the new EP. It's great to know that the Doctor is in good hands. Highlights of this season are Amy's Choice and  the Weeping Angel two parter. Long live The Doctor and the best show of all time!!

The next single, \\"Never Be The Same,\\" talks about necessary connectivity that if gone causes agony. \\"Poor Shirley\\" is like a salvation song of inspiration. \\"Ride Like The Wind,\\" another single with the nice vocals of Michael McDonald, is a song for driving. \\"The Light is On\\" is about darkness in the light and weather. \\"Sailing,\\" a major single that garnered Song of The Year, Record of The Year, and Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s), is smooth and takes you to another place of relaxation. The last track, \\"Minstrel Gigolo,\\" exploits its instrumentation and talks about dreamy attachment.
B003L20IHE|4.0|\\"Charlie St Cloud\\" features Zac Efron in the title role.  Charlie is an up and coming young adult who has just graduated high school and has the whole world in front of him when tragedy strikes.  The rest of the movie basically involves seeing how Charlie's life is altered and how he deals with his personal misfortune.  Efron, although relying on his eyes to do a lot of the acting, ultimately succeeds in gaining empathy for Charlie's unfortunate loss.<br /><br />This a family film with a special message viewers of nearly all ages will enjoy.  The acting in other key roles is right on, including newcomer Charlie Tahan's depiction of Sam St Cloud and Amanda Crew's portrayal of the girl who captures Charlie St Cloud's heart.  The supporting characters are vividly brought to the screen by two of Hollywood's best: Ray Liotta and Kim Basinger.  Although professional critics didn't provide much praise for this flick, I think audiences will feel differently.<br /><br />The screenplay is well formulated.  Due to various emotional events including love, loss, despair and (foruntately) true happiness taking place, I felt the pace of the movie was actually faster than the 1 hour and 49 minute run-time.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you missed it in theaters, check out \\"Charlie St Cloud\\" on DVD.  Your family or friends will most likely rejoice your choice.
B00005QGAT|5.0|It's debatable as to which album is better among \\"Off The Wall,\\" \\"Bad,\\" and \\"Dangerous\\" (I skipped Thriller because it's too famous). Lyrically speaking, in my view, I would crown \\"Dangerous\\" as having the best lyrics since it has more tracks and they're original (from the man himself). However, it being his first major album, I really love \\"Off The Wall.\\" The rhythm on this album in general is abundantly brilliant. From track 1 to track 10, none of the songs are dissatisfying. You have a song about heartbreak \\"She's Out Of My Life,\\" a song about encouraging a sexy person to dance with you \\"Get On The Floor,\\" and a song contemplating on stealing away a taken person \\"Girlfriend.\\" Others have magnificent beats that will keep you moving. I don't think that it's worth sitting in your car or on a train listening to this unless you could really control your motions because this is an action-packed album and it's meant for dancers. \\"Working Day and Night\\" is energetic. \\"Rock With You\\" is smooth and seductive. \\"I Can't Help It\\" is awesomely full of love. \\"It's The Falling in Love\\" is a captivating duet. \\"Off the Wall\\" is a club song. The last song is dynamic. Buy \\"Off The Wall\\" from Michael Jackson.
0307474712|3.0|This is my first encounter with David Nicholls. He's a delightful and amusing writer, full of witty and clever observations, BUT this \\"One Day\\" romance!!! Yikes!!! I wanted to strangle both the hero and heroine by page 3. They are over critical of themselves and everyone else, completely self absorbed, unable to ever experience pleasure, except by pissing each other off, and yet they relentlessly seek each other out year after year for more big doses of masochistic self and mutual flagellation. Torture yourself if you must and read this. He is certainly a witty writer, but keep a copy of the movie \\"Solomon and Sheba\\" handy and let Gina revive your libido from terminal English paralysis.
B000002UDB|5.0|What can I say? It's the Beatles for goodness sake. Every song is worth the listen, even the introduction song. \\"Fool on the Hill\\" is malicious but has a nice rhythm. \\"Flying\\" is an unexpected instrumental. \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" encourages you to listen to old hits. \\"I Am The Walrus\\" is interesting. \\"Hello Goodbye\\" is catchy. \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" is great as well as \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love.\\" This album came out in 1967. It also has a film that went along with it. Half the songs have lead vocals by McCartney while another half was performed by Lennon. For 2 months this album was #1 on the US charts.

1595141979|5.0|\\"WHY RICHELLE!\\" I asked myself during Shadow Kiss. By the time I had even reached the end of this book, I was beyond being mad. It's not because it sucked, heck no this book ROCKED. What really ticked me off was the event that happened. Which I'm not saying, you are just going to have to find out on your own by purchasing Shadow Kiss. :) Anyways now that my tantrum is over, review time! :D As I had mentioned before, this book ROCKED! Again, Ms. Mead created a story that did not disappoint. Shadow Kiss was truly a master piece. A master piece that only a talented author such as Ms. Mead can create. This book brought up different emotions that no other book, heck no other series has ever been able to bring out of me. I laughed, I cried, I smiled, I awed. I expressed every emotion possible. Ms. Mead is just an amazing author who just leaves me and will leave you wanting MORE!
0061205699|4.0|Classic banned book!  I read this book back in high school, then decided to pick it back up for this year's banned book week.<br /><br />Excellent book.  I'm not one to get all into the symbolism and deep meanings behind books.  With that said, To Kill A Mockingbird is a quick read for anyone who enjoys reading from a child's point of view and/or likes reading historical fiction.  Scout, the narrator, is a young girl from about the ages of 7-9.  She and her brother Jem, and their friend Dill who is in town only during the summers, have all kinds of imaginitive fun.  Meanwhile, Scout and Jem's dad, Atticus, is raising the children by himself while working as a/the lawyer for the town they live in.  As a lawyer, Atticus is called to defend a black man who has been accused by a trashy white man of raping his daughter.  Given the time period, this is a big deal because of race and people of the town say hateful things to/about Atticus for defending the black man and doing his job.<br /><br />This is a wonderful coming-of-age type story mixed with some historical references.  Great quick read.

No, not for the casual listener (unless you don't already have Double Fantasy, in which case this is a bargain), but I appreciate any chance to hear music that I love from another perspective.

0061433047|5.0|Well, us Pratchett fans were a bit worried I admit- but no worries here. This is a great book, and a worthy sequel. Yes, the 1st few chapters are a bit off, but then he gets back into his groove, and it's a wonderful ride. We get to see Tiffany Aching visit Ankh-Morpork and run into Captains Carrot and Angua, which is great fun.<br /><br />Of course the Nac Mac Feegle are up to their usual mischief and hijinks. After Tiffany, they are the \\"stars\\" of this series.<br /><br />We get to see Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg make a visit too, and both are in fine form.<br /><br />As in prior books, Tiffany is busy doing her normal \\"witch\\" duties but runs into a fearsome foe, one which takes all her willpower to oppose. In this case, it's the Cunning Man, an evil spirit who hates witches.<br /><br />This book is supposedly for YA readers, but it's actually an even better read for us \\"adults\\" who are young at heart.  Still, for those wanting a gift book for a YA reader, and who doesn't want to buy them more \\"vampire romance\\" I highly recommend this series. The protagonist has more than a little common sense, something which is not common enough in YA fantasy.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|shame on the industry for this kind of price i love ken follett, but will protest the excessive price by not purchasing it.
B003BZXI3M|3.0|MASTER AND COMMANDER (2003) works best in its depiction of the relationship between a beloved ship's captain (Russell Crowe) and his crew. A dinner scene is particularly engaging, as are the cultured moments of violin and cello duets. Manueverings off the coast of South America between frigate HMS Surprise and the more formidible French vessel the Acheron are also most interesting.<br /><br />This film is a letdown however in the all-important boarding and hand-to-hand battle sequence. Shot with the shakiest of handheld cameras, it's absolutely impossible to follow what's going on, practically until the skirmish's outcome is decided. If the intention here was to baffle the viewer, this film's creators succeeded in my case. Yet, being served home movie quality smeary action after eagerly anticipating a thrilling swashbuckler of cutlass, dirk and bludgeon is just very unsatisfying to this sea adventure fan.<br /><br />In all other regards, \\"M & C: The Far Side Of The World\\" is a fine motion picture.
B00009L1UP|5.0|What do you get when you mix heavy metal with progressive rock?  \\"Empire\\" released by Queensryche in 1990.  I don't consider myself a heavy metal fan by any means - distorted guitars, shouting, repetitive chords and blarring fortissississimos don't do much for me.  This album is different - WAY different.  It bridges the genre with an amazing level of musicianship and orchestration - a quality not often seen in top-40 music.<br /><br />My brother first introduced me to them with the hit \\"Silent Lucidity.\\" I immediately bought the album and discovered that there's not a weak song on it - quoting one reviewer \\"Every song is great, and a few are exceptionally great.\\"  What amazes me every time I listen to this album is now each member of the group compliments the flow of the song.  For example, drummer Scott Rockenfield is extremely creative in changing up patterns between verse and chorus, as well as properly placing accents and fills.  The guitarists are just as creative.  Nothing is repeated to the point of boredom.<br /><br />I'm going to touch briefly on what I consider the outstanding songs. The opening song \\"Best I Can\\" is an awesome jam with a great message, complimented with a cool 7/8 guitar solo.  \\"Is There Anybody Listening\\" is another amazing song that starts off as softly and is transformed into a powerful, intense ballad.  It's interesting how the intensity of the lyrics is supported by the music - it breaks and revives at the expected time.<br /><br />Another favorite is \\"One and Only.\\"  The intro begins with the guitars in a rhythm pattern that appears throughout the piece, unifying it as a whole.  The ending is cool in which that guitar rhythm doesn't quite match up with the drums and bass.<br /><br />Most listeners reading this review, I would assume, are familiar with the hit \\"Silent Lucidity\\" which peaked at #7 on Billboard's chart.  It's an amazing tune which deserves close examination.  Listen to lead singer Geoff Tate, who has an amazing, crystal-clear voice, spanning two+ octaves.  Listen to the instrumental section in which the \\"voices\\" are heard.  You can feel the tension as the bass and strings begin in unison, pull apart, then end in unison - the tension one feels in a disturbing dream.  Listen to how the drums and strings mimic the phrase \\"walls come tumblin down.\\"<br /><br />I could easily take up another page going through each track and what great compositions they are.  I've purchased several other albums by the group and none are on the par with \\"Empire.\\"  I truly would encourage any listener to give this album a fair shake, even if you're like me and don't listen to heavy metal regularly.

B002U0KHMY|5.0|When I watched the debut of White Collar, I was hooked. I knew I'd be a loyal viewer not only because of the interesting plot but because of the amazing cast of characters that brought it all to life.<br />There is no way anyone should be w/o the first season of White Collar, not only will you be intrigued by each episode but the tone between the characters will always keep you entertained.<br />However, if that weren't enough the DVD extra's are the icing on the White Collar cake. Especially, the outtakes, the cast obviusly has an amazing time togetether and that only makes the series seem more lasting.Not to mention you get to see Matt Bomer belt out a song, that in itself is worth owning this DVD.<br />So unless you don't like intrigue, fun, and a little bit of music (even some dancing) don't waste your time. But if you love all those things ADD this to your collection. Believe me you'll want to keep adding to your White Collar collection, just don't steal it ;) We can't all be as smooth as Neil.
014241493X|3.0|\\"What a treacherous thing it is to believe that a person is more than a person\\"<br />Quentin Jacobsen lives next to Margo Roth Spiegelman, the most amazing girl in the world, in his eyes.  One night, the two roam the streets on adventures.  The next day, Margo is gone.  Where did Margo go?  And was Margo really the girl Quentin thought she was?<br /><br />I Liked:<br />This is a very thought-provoking novel.  Sure, it's your typical \\"coming of age\\" teen story (I read a fair piece back in my day), but I found that even for adults, you could take quite a bit away.<br />One of the things most applicable to ALL age groups is the concept of \\"paper people\\", of people being more than what you see of them.  How often do you act one way around your significant other, one way around your family, one way around your boss, and a completely different way around your friends?  We all have these vast, different sides of ourselves, and we struggle trying to figure out who we are from the face(s) we show others.  And often times, we come up feeling empty, fake, \\"paper\\" because we aren't the fun, wild, smart, quirky person we project to others.  I thought that this was a particularly brilliant topic to bring up.<br />I also rather liked how Green used the Whitman poems to accentuate and clarify his theme.  I will be the first to loudly proclaim my hatred for poetry (long, complicated, boring story), but I found that this story helped me understand his poem and gave me a deeper appreciation.  Quentin's struggle to understand the poem, to glean insight into Margo mirrored all those hours I'd spend struggling over poems, trying to figure out what they said.  Only here, I have an author, gently pushing me towards what the poet was saying.<br />My favorite character was Radar.  I liked his nerdiness (being obsessed with the Wikipedia substitute) and yet still being normal enough to get a girlfriend.  He was a great friend, a balance between Quentin and Ben.  Further, I liked how he would smack Quentin down when Quentin got a little strung out.<br />Although the novel is about a fairly serious topic, I found it quite humorous.  There are at least five occasions at which I laughed out loud--a pretty good record, in my book.  The boys' have great comedic wordplay and bounce off each other nicely.  And I couldn't help but burst into laughter about Radar's parents being \\"black Santa\\" collectors.<br /><br />I Didn't Like:<br />This is a pretty straightforward \\"coming of age\\" novel, as I said above.  And while it does have great kernels for adults, there is still tons of teenaged drama: who is dating whom, bullies, high school is your life (though Quentin quickly realizes that there is more than high school), and the like.  That stuff just didn't appeal to me.  Plus, I've read a ton of teen novels like this in my own teenaged years.<br />I was never that fond of Margo.  She struck me as a fairly self-centered drama-queen.  Of course, the whole point of the book is to learn more about her and see her who she is, instead of how others see her, but I never was as enamored of her as Quentin was (in fact, I was often hoping someone would smack her!).  And I think it was pretty mean of her to leave like she did, leaving no note, nothing, not even for the sister she said she loved.<br />Another character that seriously grated on my nerves was Ben.  Gah, was he annoying!  He wasn't funny (most of the time, unless he was bouncing off Radar and Quentin), he was obnoxious, and he was irritating.  The less of him I read, the better.<br />For a teen novel, there is quite a bit of swearing, crass humor, and sex talk.  Older teens wouldn't have a problem, but I certainly wouldn't recommend to the younger set.  And since the novel is about seniors, that probably would be the best age to read this novel.<br /><br />Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:<br />Surprisingly heavy for a young adult novel.  Milder swears, like da** and he**, appear alongside harsher ones like sh** and f-bombs.<br />Lots of talk of genitalia, one of the night's events involves taking a picture of a boy who happens to have a small AHEM, a girl is said to have had STDs, Ben fancies himself a player...<br />At the beginning, Quentin and Margo stumble upon a man who committed suicide.  Quentin and Margo break into people's homes and vandalize.<br /><br />Overall:<br />While I am most certainly not in the target range, I still was able to enjoy the message of the novel: people are more than what they seem.  This book, snuggled away in the young adult section, tells this story in a way more poignant than I've ever read an adult novel.  Amidst the swearing, the high school drama, and the characters, there is a good story, one that older teens and the young at heart can enjoy.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B000W93CHC|4.0|Although I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it was not as good as Pillars of the Earth.  It's also okay if you have not read Pillars, as there are only a few references to it in this book. It's odd, I really have not enjoyed any of Follett's other books.

0061433047|5.0|Terry Pratchett is my favorite living writer. That said, I have not always enjoyed his novels because, quite simply, some are better than others. I Shall Wear Midnight is a magnificent entry into the Tiffany Aching series. If you enjoyed the other books in this series, you'll love this one. The plot is a bit slow at first, but it soon gets going and is a fun read all the way through. Tiffany is growing up, and Terry Pratchett gives her more difficult problems, more difficult people, and more difficult problem-people in this book than in the previous books in this series. This makes the story fun, exciting and interesting. It is my hope and prayer that Terry is able to fully enjoy the success of this novel before Alzheimer's robs him of his mind.
B00275EGX8|3.0|THE HURT LOCKER won best picture for 2009, after my six art house friends and I saw it. There is nothing extraordinary about THE HURT LOCKER, which is the least-viewed \\"Best Picture\\" in history, a kind of reminder that \\"Best Pictures\\" don't equate to \\"Most Popular Pictures.\\"<br /><br />It's the story of a US Army bomb-defusing specialist in Iraq, and the various horrors he faces unflinchingly throughout the day. As such, its a grand endorsement of our troops and a grand indictment of our war.<br /><br />Still, I have no idea why THE HURT LOCKER won, other than it wasn't the bloated AVATAR. From what I've read it isn't particularly accurate, and it has a pace slower than that of its hero in his blast suit. It's worth seeing (once), but its not at all memorable. If it hadn't been the dark horse Oscar winner, I doubt I'd even remember it.
0321334876|5.0|Developing software in a matured and large software development team makes a junior C++ developer like me grow much faster in a right track. Programming becomes much more straightforward when one is working in a resource-established environment. As is often said that a good programmer behaves \\"lazy\\", I always tried to take the advantages of the same conventions and idioms that our senior developers adopted. Doing this is practical and reasonable when considered in the context of rapid development. However, any developer should know the theory behind those conventions and idioms if she is going to do some serious software development. Meyers' Effective C++ is such a complement that reveals the story behind the scene in C++. For me, I probably know and even implicitly applied many suggestions it mentioned in the book to my own project but had never really thought about them.    The book discussed 50 more ways in different items for effective C++ programming. In each item, besides to show a proofed convention or idiom of doing something, it often provides another way to achieve the same goal, which is more intuitive but plausible. Had I been more \\"diligent\\" in exploring my own way of developing the software, I would have probably stepped onto those pitfalls for dozens of times, some of which are even very subtle and hard to detect.
B002VPE1AW|2.0|James Cameron should be ashamed of AVATAR. With a half-billion dollar budget and more hype than a Beatles reunion, this film should have been extraordinary. And I'll grant you this, that AVATAR is an extraordinary visual experience. Cameron has crafted an entire painstakingly detailed world onscreen, and as long as we stay immersed in that world AVATAR delivers all that it promises.<br /><br />But like so many sci-fi creators, Cameron committed the Cardinal Sin: He spent a half-billion dollars on effects and a buck three eighty on the storyline, which is nothing more than an unsatisfying high tech extraterrestrial version of cowboys and indians.<br /><br />Considering that he probably could have cured cancer for what this picture cost to make, Cameron should spend the next ten years in retreat, doing just that. [[ASIN:B00275EGWY The Hurt Locker]] wasn't much as a Best Picture winner that year but it sent the message loud and clear that obscenely budgeted movies still need to have more than flash in order to succeed.
1400052173|5.0|I just finished reading this most wonderful book written by Rebecca Skloot: \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\". Skloot wrote this book with the heart of a humanitarian & the mind of a research scientist.<br /><br />During painful cancer treatments in the early '50's & even after her death, Henrietta's (HeLa) cells were taken & used for much research, and were instrumental in creating a vaccine for polio, for one. To this day, millions of HeLa cells are in labs all over the world.<br /><br />Ms. Skloot's willingness to spend many days & nights with the Lacks' grown children, despite their jaded experience with others who tried to get close to them for their own monetary gain, is endearing. The aftermath of leaving children behind (even one young daughter in a mental hospital) is absolute heartbreak.<br /><br />Skloot's exhaustive research is impeccable & complete.<br /><br />You MUST treat yourself to this stunningly told & well-researched book. What a treasure.
B00049QQHI|2.0|Jim Carroll is a basketball star. He and his gang of friends get into gang fights and steal things in their spare time. When Jim gets involved in drugs, his life slowly start to deteriorate. More and more problems arise as he continues to get fixated and goes to more horrific and depressing extremes in order to get his next fix. The film details his descent from basketball star to full-fledged junkie. Based on the diaries by writer Jim Carroll, the film was in the making for several years before finally being released to mixed reviews in the mid-90s. Being a big fan of the book, I watched this film. This is what I think of it.    This film could have been great. Indeed, it isn't terrible. There is a lot to admire about this piece of work. For starters, Leonardo DiCaprio's performance. He displays a strong range of talent reminiscent of James Dean. His performance is definitely very memorable and extremely realistic. The soundtrack to the film is also quite top-notch and truly lends itself to the angry tone of the film. I also appreciated much of the early scenes in the film and I found many of them to have a true sense of gritty realism as well as a type of ironic detachment that you really don't see too often these days. Juliette Lewis, despite her role being very brief, does an excellent job as well and, had she gotten more to do, could have really been remembered for her role. The film also gets the look of the dank, dark, grimy streets of New York down pitch-perfect. You can really get a true feel for the atmosphere and the scum that pervades the life of Jim and of his friends. You really get a sense of the filmmaker almost being a witness to the type of depraved behavior depicted in the film.    Unfortunately, the flaws outweigh the positives in this film. One of my biggest complaints has to do with the terrible decision to change the time of the story from the 80s to the mid-90s. If there were any time period this film should have been set in it should have been the 80s. The film's soundtrack consists mostly of 80s music. The idea of 80s excess was a big part of the original book and almost lent itself to a kind of realism nearly on par with Less than Zero(the novel) in terms of it's graphic depiction from a boy whose love of life and of writing was corrupted by drug addiction and peer pressure. Unfortunately, the shift from the 80s to the mid-90s not only destroys any chance of any of those themes being explored, but also turns the film into nothing more than a mid-90s cautionary drug tale. The problems with the film, unfortunately, don't even end there. Mark Wahlberg and Ernie Hudson are known for some tremendous work in the past, but their performances in this film have to be some of their worst work ever! Mark Wahlberg is painfully one-dimensional and he manages to not even be able to do THAT right! His performance comes off completely too over-the-top and forced to the point where you cringe at his line delivery! This was before Boogie Nights, so at least he has an excuse, but what was Ernie Hudson thinking??? His character comes off as the stereotypical would-be hero who has been through it all and has made something of himself. It comes off completely fake and simply too cartoonish in nature. He was very miscast in the role and he is ultimately what takes the film down even further. My absolute worst complaint, however, has to do with one particular scene. While I cannot say what goes on in this scene, I will say that the way the filmmakers depicted it was far too over-the-top and extreme in it's nature. It's one of the most notorious scenes in the film, so I'm sure you've heard of it, the infamous \\"bathroom stall scene\\". Yeah, the way it is handled in the film is completely gratuitous and absolutely disgusting. It is the sole reason why I refuse to outright recommend this film. Many folks will likely attack me and say \\"Oh, well that's how it really happens\\" or \\"Oh, well you've never experienced what that Jim guyexperienced so you don't know what you're talking about\\". Well, perhaps that's true. Perhaps I have never been a prostitute, nor have I been a drug addict. However, that does not make the scene less graphic and explicit than it needed to be. It's an absolutely disgusting and far too grotesque scene that was completely uncalled for.    As it stands, I can still appreciate the film because it does some things right. I did like the moments of humor and the little scenes that ring true about growing up and being admired by your peers. However, if you have read the book you will be seriously disappointed. The film was a bit too flawed for me to really enjoy or be intrigued by. It's a well-made film in a lot of ways, but I cannot recommend the film to fans of the book. If you are a fan of the book, you will hate this film. If you've never read it, check it out. You might like it.

0439023491|5.0|I'm giving Catching Fire 5 stars, even though it was irritating to have so much back-story sprinkled in throughout the first part of the book. I can't imagine anyone starting the Hunger Games trilogy with the middle book so it seemed unnecessary.  Aside from that, this book is so well-plotted and exciting that I couldn't put it down.  Of course it wasn't as novel since the Hunger Games took away the surprise of the premise of the overall plot of the series, but it did continue the irresistible story of Katniss and her futuristic dark world of the future.<br /><br />How Collins came up with the plotting of her series, much less all the details of what life would be like to live under such a repressive ruler is amazing.  Her imagination and intelligence as an author makes this story catch fire in a way that keeps the reader turning page after page.  The conflict is all encompassing.  First you have the possible conflict of the rebels in the 12 districts.  Second you have the conflict of Katniss as she must choose between to men.  Third, you have the conflict of the games themselves.  All of this conflict creates a tension that doesn't let up until the end of the book, and continues into the third and final book of the Hunger Games.<br /><br />While this book is meant for kids 12 years and older, and probably rightly so because of the violence, I imagine that younger kids are reading it too.  I wouldn't have a problem with that because the violence is not gratuitous, and the characters are conflicted about doing the violence.  Kids see far worse on television if they watch the news or play video games.  At least in this book the violence has a reason and the characters in the novel are real people who we care about.  Their lives are not in vain.
B001UV4XWY|4.0|To understand this movie you must first understand Ayn Rand's conceptualization of altruism, its evils, the evil of those who try to \\"sell\\" altruism and especially those who try to sell the concept through the guise of religion.  Altruism is ultimately self-sacrifice, a full denigration of the self.    \\"Do not confuse altruism with kindness, good will or respect for the rights of others. These are not primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, altruism makes impossible. The irreducible primary of altruism, the basic absolute, is self-sacrifice--which means; self-immolation, self-abnegation, self-denial, self-destruction--which means: the self as a standard of evil, the selfless as a standard of the good.\\" - Ayn Rand    Major lessons of this movie: 1) There is no such thing as a free lunch and 2) never, EVER atone for someone else's sins.    There are actually TWO solutions to the dilemma: 1) do not press the button and 2) leave the son blind and deaf.  Why (2)?  First, realize that the dead people and crippled son were the result of someone else's evil deeds and NOT YOURS TO ATONE FOR.  With the mother dead and the father in prison, the son is left parentless and as a ward of the state, presumably with no one fighting in his best interests any longer.  The best thing was for the parents to have realize the morality of staying alive to continue to fight to have the problem corrected in another way.    I suggest that those that do not understand this movie do not understand altruism for what it actually is.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|'Little Dorrit' is another one of those superb BBC productions. Not just for the Dicken's lovers out there, but for anyone who appreciates quality acting and wonderful scenery. I don't think you will be at all disappointed sitting down with your hot cup of tea and your favourite biscuits, while getting caught up in the intrigue and mystery that surrounds the Dorritt family. This particular series has a wonderful cast of actors which you can't help but fall in love with. Claire Foy portrays little Amy Dorritt brillaintly with her shy, yet intuiative nature, offset by her proud and needy father played by Tom Courtenay. The handsome Arthur Clennam played by Matthew Macfadyen is the perfect stranger to throw amongst the mix. This adaptation features the wonderful talents of Mr Andrew Davies and along with the most detailed sets, this dvd is one which you will want to watch over and over again. You will not be disappointed.
B003MX5P20|5.0|I was not surprised that Enrique's new album was gonna be great, but what did surprise me in a good way is that American caught on ! =) its been a while since Enrique got the recognition he deserves in the english music scene. alltho I like it is not my favorite it was a great first choice for single. the album is amazing from from start to finish,tho you should invest in the deluxe version, Heart breaker, Why not me? and Coming Home are great additions. i wish he included Everything is Gonna Be Alright which was only on the international edition.     my favorite song's are: Not in order of CD just off the top of my head.     1. Heartbeat w/Nicole Sherzinger -such a trancey electronic love ballad is how i can describe it  2. Cuando me Enamoro- OMG what a great song w/Juan luis Guerra romantic and beautiful  3. Dirty Dancer feat. Usher- perfect for pre clubbing drive =)   4. No me Digas que NO feat Winsin Y Yandel - the lyrics are so great and if you don't understand spanish you will  still love it =) and nice summery beat .  5. Heartbreaker sounds like it could have been on his album 7, great ballad .  6.Why Not ME? - contemplative song about not being the one, love his voice here too.    the rest of the songs are really good also not one filler !

It is as engaging as any fictional book but you are learning as you read. Could use some more illustrations, both verbal and graphical, of some concepts to get through some of the more esoteric parts but otherwise does a great job of melding the how the thinking came about technically and socially.

B003Y8YXH6|5.0|Stripped away from the background vocals, the lush arrangements, the over excessive production slickness of the time and what do you have....? A vocalist of great power and subtlety, this version (remastered beautifully) is a testimony to John's vocal art. It also puts a new vibe on the songs, Starting Over really captures the retro feel of Elvis and his ilk that John so admired, and Woman shimmers with John's magnificent acoustic guitar brought front and center.<br /><br />Say what you will about Yoko, I thank deeply her for keeping John's music alive and well (well well well ooooh well, and always in beautifully designed packaging befitting John's stature.<br /><br />I was angry when I learned that this version was not included in the JL Signature Box, but now after hearing it, all is forgiven. And concerning Yoko's songs on the album, they've never sounded this good.<br /><br />Also, for the price it's a great value.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is a great movie for kids and the kid at heart. An adventure story that brings a grumpy old man, an inept boy scout with good intentions and a couple odd characters who help them get through their challenges. A good story about childhood dreams that don't always come out like you thought. Still, I thought that it was a feel good story that I really enjoyed. Obviously, I bought the DVD.
1439148953|4.0|This is a sweet book of coming of age. The main character is endearing. I had a little trouble getting into it, but once I passed page 50 or so I was hooked. Likewise, near the end, I wanted the story to cut to the chase and reach resolution. But the development of the character is superb. I initially thought my familiarity with Brooklyn would be the book's main appeal, but it really turned out to be about the people.

030745455X|5.0|One of the best crime novels I've read in a long while, the author started with the main characters from the last novel (The Girl Who Played with Fire) and weaved a fascinating story about murder mystery and sex crime.  The book introduced a number of side characters, some of whom had opposite or compelling goals.  This really made the story development much more interesting.  I really had a hard time putting the book down.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the book ended somewhat abruptly.  There were also some loose ends that didn't get tied down.  Reader may not be satisfied with the ending and be compelled to start reading the third novel right away.  I suspect that is the intent of the author and publisher anyway.

0312600844|3.0|BOOK REVIEW: `FREEDOM'      The hype-machine has certainly done its work for this book. Ensconced in the Hardback Top Ten, with HarperCollins' giant paperback edition competing for the beach reader's buck on the `Buy One Get One Half Price' table in Gatwick's WH Smith's alongside Dan Brown and Stieg Larsson, Freedom seems to be on everyone's must-read list despite the fact that most of us had never even heard of its author a fortnight ago.     So how has a work marketed a `Literary' scored such a commercial smash hit? The reason is simple - this is in fact mainstream commercial fiction with literary knobs on. There are no surprises here.    Take the cast (please): Patty is a female Garp, morphed from a wrestler into a basketball jock; Richard, the unattained pash of Patty's college years, is a deck-laying coke-snorting aspiring rock star who thinks and talks in a way I imagine a fictional Lou Reed might think and talk if he weren't already fictional; Patty's husband, Walter, is Richard's best friend, and - in case Franzen thinks we are unable to grasp that they have contrasting personalities - is a teetotalling nerd who is prone to blushing (he has a pill-empowered rant from a podium late in the book that is too reminiscent of Lucky Jim to be excusable); Patty and Walter's son, Joey, is an inconsistent mess of a character, at first a smart-talking, quick-thinking teenage entrepreneur, then soon after turning into a self-doubting new Jew pathetically being given the runaround by his best friend's beautiful airhead sister.     This sister, Jenna, is one of many dubiously-drawn women in the book. They include Patty's besotted college friend Eliza, who conceals her heroin addiction from Patty, and pays the ultimate price (Patty spots her in a welfare line years later and reports that she has PUT ON WEIGHT. Yes, Freedom is one of Oprah's recommendations!); there is Patty's sensible daughter Jessica, for whom Franzen never gets around to dreaming up an interesting storyline; we have Walter's young-enough-to-be-his-daughter assistant and lover, Lalitha, who is so driven by love and moral conviction she ends up driving off the side of a mountain; Joey's moronically doting girlfriend Connie, who indulges in some self-harming that Franzen soon loses interest in; Connie's white trash mom, Carol, who is everything you'd expect a white trash mom to be; and the aforementioned Jenna, who is a heartless horse-riding bitch whose depiction borders on misogynistic.     So what qualifies Freedom as the latest Great American Novel? Not much, in truth. Franzen bores us with some semi-satirical goings-on concerning endangered birds, mountain-top mining, population growth, and the selling of useless spare truck parts to the US army: it's all about profit-margins, colluding politicians and businessmen, and the impossibility of maintaining a moral conscience in a capitalist world, or something like that. Either way, this stuff doesn't sit well with the ongoing family saga. Neither do all the cultural references - teenagers' texting habits, endless name-checking of rock groups, that sort of thing - or the brief diversions into Jewish heritage, or the hardships of Swedish immigrants. It all seems tacked-on, as if Franzen knows the thrust of the storyline - the love lives of a bunch of two-dimensional depressives (most of the characters consider suicide at one stage or another, but none get around to it, sadly) - might not earn him his rightful place in the Pantheon of Greats (he shamelessly name-drops Tolstoy for no apparent reason).      What makes the novel interesting, at least for the first few chapters, is its telling. A stand-alone opening chapter outlines Patty and Walter's existence in a gentrified suburb called Ramsey Hill. This is a tour-de-force of acutely observed satirical writing (I believe it was published as a short story in the New Yorker). As the book progresses, the missing details of their family life are filled in, initially by way of a therapist-suggested autobiographic exercise by Patty(this is reprised towards the end of the book). Patty's testimony is in a peculiarly forced Third Person - she refers to herself as `the autobiographer' - which seemed far too much like cleverdickery to this particular reader.  We then go on to spend time with Richard, Joey and Walter in a conventionally-told narrative (although there are a few odd authorial intrusions, such as when we are informed that we all like the smell of our own farts. If there was some Austenian irony here, I must have missed it). The problem is, after Patty's three-chapter section, the tale begins to slide into banality. Richard, Joey and Walter aren't very interesting people to spend time with, and as the various plot threads begin to take over, the freefall of Freedom becomes unstoppable. I hate to be a spoiler (not), but there is a cringe-worthy scene where Patty and Walter are re-united after a six-year separation, and Walter literally brings her in from the cold. And it gets worse: The newly-happy couple spread seasonal goodwill throughout the neighborhood before going to live in NYC to be with their no-longer-estranged kids and Walter's best-friend-again Richard, who has started writing right-on songs dedicated to Walter. And before they leave their summer retreat - the scene of both Patty's infidelity with Richard and the married couple's reunification - they convert it into a conservation area for migrating birds. Heart-warming, or what?  I don't know if this was supposed to evoke the spirit of a Shakespeare problem play, but all it brought to this reader's mind was the voice-over at the end of The Waltons.      I haven't mentioned Franzen's Capital Letter Habit. His abbreviated sentences. Or: His colons. But they are minor annoyances compared to the general disappointment here. If Franzen is such a great observer of Modern American Life, then he seems to have been doing the bulk of his observing on the television. A pair of `cool' and `uncool' best friends straight out of Happy Days; battle-of-the-bands contests; permanently leather-jacketed rock stars; redneck thugs; ruthless businessmen; conspiring politicians; sluttish teenagers; pretentious arty types; snobbish neighbours - it's a parade of fictional stereotypes, hardly a state-of-the-nation address. Add the mawkish ending to the equation, and the latest Great American Novel is not even a very good one.     George Michael once sang, in an 80s tune that Franzen misses a trick by failing to name-check, `I don't want your Freedom.' I'm inclined to agree with him.
B001GCUO5M|2.0|The biggest issue is that if you can't figure out the ending within the first five minutes of this movie then you must be new to watching movies or reading books.  From there, it just follows the numbers.  Uninspired.
B0012GMVQC|3.0|Yep, crazy fast tunes with nutty lyrics.  There are several on this disc that I mixed with a couple of similar tunes from other Beck albums to get a really great playlist for high speed driving.  This is definitely not Beck's best stuff; much different than most of his other work. But it's worth a listen. Easy to get a speeding ticket playing this CD in a fast car.
B001HN69B8|3.0|I think the best word to describe this movie is \\"surreal\\".  I *LOVED* the basic concept-- the theme of the importance of imagination and storytelling-- but something about the plot and storyline doesn't quite work for me, and I can't put my finger on it. Without going into spoilers, I think I was not so happy with the direction that the development of Tony's character takes, and above all with the details of Parnassus' final bargain with 'Nick'. I also felt there were one or two loose ends left hanging.
B003405MF6|3.0|Hey, if you're a fan of Beck's music this one is worth a listen.  It's not great but you'll find a couple you like.  Look to other reviews if you need some convincing details of tunes.  Better to just buy a good used copy and hear for yourself.
B001IYCMNA|1.0|I had been wanting something to replace my aging but still working Linksys WAP54G Wireless G Access Point for some time. I avoided the WAP4400n because of negative reviews and many problems experienced by users. So when Cisco finally came out with a newer model the WAP4410n, I figured they must have fixed the problems in the WAP4400n. They couldn't possibly release a new model with the same problems as the old one right? Wrong! I purchased two of these from Amazon. The first one arrived and worked perfectly until I decided to upgrade the firmware to the latest version. After that, no connection, no nothing. It just died. A second unit had the same results, another brick. Now, I have upgraded the firmware in my old access point and router on several occasions and never had a problem. It is not rocket science but you must do it correctly or a brick is what you will get. I am a network administrator by profession. I thought I had done everything right but I was beginning to second guess myself. A conversation and some tests by Cisco Tech Support determined that both units were defective and I should return them. Amazon graciously took them back and refunded my money.    Looking for an alternative, I did some research and found the TRENDnet TEW-670AP Dual Band Wireless N Access Point. After buying nothing but Linksys products for years, I was reluctant to trust an unknown brand like TRENDnet but after my experience with Cisco, I had nothing to lose. I decided to try TRENDnet and purchased the TEW-670AP. The unit has great specs, 5GHz that the Cisco unit couldn't match and great performance, often connecting at 300Mbps. It also costs less than the Cisco unit. I couldn't be happier. I highly recommend the TRENDnet TEW-670AP. Avoid the Cisco WAP4410n like the plague!

B003XMUFGQ|3.0|I have been a huge Clapton fan since the 70's, but I had to give this album 3 stars. The blues numbers are great, but I wish Clapton would have written more new songs. The song choices are underwhelming, but maybe I had higher expectations for this album.   Clapton is in great vocal form, but Derek Trucks and Doyle Bramhall II apparently, are doing most of the guitar chores on this album. I have to give it few more listenings for it to grow on me, which hasn't always been the case with Clapton's work.
B001AW9DKK|2.0|The magic that was once CSN and sometimes Y is apparently in it's waning days.      The core of the \\"CSN\\" sound from the inception was always three part vocal harmony. Yes, the song writing was always excellent, and the instrumental prowess of Stills and the sometimes Young enhanced the experience. But let's face it. Without those harmonies, it falls apart.  Neil was never a harmony singer, and when he tried to be, he generally threw a wrench into things. So when he was on board, armed with 60% of the material, the sound really didn't suffer much with his distinctive lead vocal. CSN would lay on their lush harmonies, and it all seemed to work well.    So true to form, here we have a live album with Neil providing most of the script.  Neil still sounds like Neil. But then, he never did have a great voice, and as such the onset of elder years hasn't had the same deteriorating effect it's had, on say, Stephen Stills.     It is truly time for Stills to realize he can no longer sing. Especially harmony. They do a version of Wooden Ships on here where Nash has assumed the tradional Stills parts. And that works fine...Nash can still sing. The song goes along fairly well until the first chorus...where Stills attempts to add the third harmony. Sadly, the poor man almost sounds like an old drunk....sitting at the bar...trying his best to sound like George Jones on the jukebox.  Stills has been over time one of rocks great guitarists, songwriters, and singers.  The latter has passed him by, I'm afraid.    Nash is still steady ol' Nash.  But since this album is largely political, it might of been nice to hear more from Nash. Military Madness is a great choice...but how about Soldiers of Peace?  I think Neil could have made room for another great Nash tune within the scope of the songlist.    Crosby, with his recent weight loss, seems have regained some of the smooth timbre in his once elegant voice. Like Nash, Crosby has routinely been squeezed out a bit when Neil's on board. No Long Time Gone here, which would have been a natural, but hey, it's been covered over and over. Gone Forever from the CPR catalog makes a nice anti-war statement..would have been a nice surprise on here.  Make some room, Neil, gee-whiz.    All-in-all, it's not one of my favorite albums. It's almost like there's two different shows going on. The \\"Neil Show\\" is all about making a political statement...well, more like pounding the statement into our heads...Ok, Neil. Think we get where you stand. He even marches out a horn section for his songs. Just seems so 'un-CSNY' like.    The \\"CSN Show\\" almost seems like they found some old cuts in a box somehere and tossed them in just make things seem more fair.  All old songs that we've heard a million times...rehashed and made worse by comparison to previous recordings.      I really don't recommend this album.

B003QZ5222|1.0|Horribly disappointed. Compared each to the original Columbia cd's from late 80's early 90's. There was no sonic difference other than, inexplicably, Nebraska was SLOWER.

Ugh - waste of my money...
B003EYVXUK|3.0|Another money-grabbing remake from Hollywood.  Oh well, at least it is a rehashing of one of the best horror films of the new millenium.  And I will admit, Director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) does a very solid job.  I was kind of hoping for an exact shot for shot remake like Funny Games, even though that would be completely pointless.  Let Me In does make enough minor changes to give the story a bit of a new feel, although much is lost in comparison.  Even though it infuses more violence and graphic images, it somehow loses nearly all of the visceral impact the original conveyed.<br /><br />Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass) does a tremendous job as Abby, the mysterious new girl in town that only comes out at night.  I also enjoyed watching Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Road) as Owen, the lonely boy that gets bullied at school.  The two make a strange connection and rely on each other for support.<br /><br />All the great scenes from the original are duplicated here--the murder in the woods, the feeding in the tunnel, the swimming pool slaughter.  The differences are pretty drastic though, regardless of the extra blood or more frantic feel.  They all fall well short of the intensity and suspense from The Right One.  There are some additional moments that include flesh burning and frozen corpses that are worth mentioning.<br /><br />It's always good to see a quality horror film be embraced and supported on the big screen.  Hopefully Let Me In will encourage others to checkout the original<br /><br />Bottom line--entertaining, but inferior.
B003EYVXUU|4.0|The cynic in me hates the reasons for recreating one of 2008's greatest films, [[ASIN:B001MYIXAC Let The Right One In]] or Låt den r&auml;tte komma in, an absolutely perfect romantic horror film that didn't need to be remade at all, much less only two years later.  The reasons are simple; the American audience that fills up theaters is much less likely to show up to a film that is in Swedish and lacks the special effects hooks and quasi-starpower of this remake.  Regardless if it is a remake or not, Let the Right One In is a superior film and I preface this review of its Americanized remake with the highest recommendation I can possibly give to the original.  However, do not let this play down entirely the fact that Let Me In is overall a terrifically disturbing and enjoyable horror film in its own right.<br /><br />The film takes place in Los Alamos, New Mexico and follows a sad twelve year old outcast named Owen (called Oskar in the 2008 movie).  Owen is neglected by his selfish parents and abused, sometimes brutally, by his peers at school.  He's easy to like but has some quirks that really put his relationship with the audience under scrutiny.  Owen is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee who won't get the credit his co-star Chloe Moretz will get in many circles but deserves it just the same.  Owen gets a new neighbor in Abby (played by Moretz, who was great earlier this year as Hit Girl in the super hero action comedy [[ASIN:B002ZG983M Kick-Ass]]), a strange girl who doesn't wear shoes in the snow and seems altogether careless about her appearance.  Owen and Abby grow to have a wonderful relationship and although the film's sense of romance didn't hook me in as deeply as the original film did, it still works.  The major obstacle to Owen and Abby's budding friendship is simple; she is a vampire.  The supporting cast is great here and the although Elias Koteas's character was not present in the 2008 film, he is a welcome addition if only for the fact that this guy is a such a fantastic actor.  Richard Jenkins, an actor who dominated every frame of another great 2008 film [[ASIN:B0015OKWKI The Visitor]], plays the role of Abby's \\"father\\" and protector.  He is, as always, amazing.<br /><br />I have to give director Matt Reeves ([[ASIN:B0014Z4OQG Cloverfield]]) credit for giving this story the respect it deserves.  He is a very good filmmaker and knows how to make an audience uncomfortable while also connecting to the characters.  He loses some points for taking on a project that either he or the producers merely intended to cash in on, and despite having some meticulous aesthetic strengths he only imitates the over powering atmosphere of the original film.  I don't like some of the special effects used for Abby, in particular the obvious use of CGI, but others will.  I didn't like that the film pulled some punches in areas that might make a more broad audience uncomfortable.  On the other hand I thought that one scene in particular was actually an improvement from the original.  Still, the original can't be touched and shame on them for trying.  But in the end this is a very good horror film by any standard and you should see it before Halloween, because it will be much better than the other garbage you'll be asked to see through endless obnoxious advertisements in the coming weeks.ic actor.

B00006FM77|5.0|The remastering of this recording, which has been justly criticized in the past for its thin sound, is a revelation.  Chicago displays chops galore, in particular the late Terry Kath whose playing had impressed Jimi Hendrix years earlier.<br /><br />The sound is clean without sounding artificial, which is sometimes a problem for live recordings that have been remastered in the age of CDs because they end up sounding fake.<br /><br />What stands out are: 1) Kath really was the heart and soul of Chicago, a rocker whose passing softened the band's tone and (sadly) damaged their reputation.  That, too, was the band's fault, which would today be enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame had they called it quits after his death.  Along those lines, Kath was an imaginative guitarist who should be considered among the pantheon of great axe wielders.  He was also a soulful singer and eccentric (in a good way) songwriter.  2) James Pankow and Robert Lamm are among the most criminally overlooked songwriters in rock, whose early songs easily stand up to the best of the era.  3) Peter Cetera, who is often seen as a lame songwriter for his later syrupy offerings, was an outstanding bassist and singer whose contributions as a songwriter in the early days of the band were important in offering a quieter (but not wimpy) counterpoint to Lamm, Pankow and especially Kath.<br /><br />Rhino deserves our gratitude for reminding us of Chicago's power in in its heyday.  This set, Chicago's fourth album, is the culmination of the first and best phase of their career.  It's highly recommended for fans of Chicago and anyone interested in American experimental rock that mixed innovative high-powered rock guitar with complex jazz/soul influenced horn lines that resulted in songs that cut across genres.  The excellent packaging, clean sound and unearthed bonus CD is well worth the price.
B00012L786|5.0|This is a review of PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET (1953) directed by Samuel Fuller. Richard Widmark stars in this slice of noir life as pick pocket Skip McCoy, well known to just about everyone who counts on the police force or of underworld society.<br />One day McCoy is doing business on the El and he cleans a purse that contains some super sensitive micro film containing US Military secrets. And he is spotted with his hand in the cookie jar.<br /><br />The rest of PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET leads us through various underworld habitues as Skip tries to dodge both the well known authorities as well as the somewhat amatuerish but lethal red security force .  When a colorful street seller is brutally murdered by red agents McCoy finally chooses sides.<br /><br />PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is a Samuel Fuller classic, with just enough action, suspense and mystery to keep most viewers interested throughout the film.<br />PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is rife with fine performances, especially by Richard Widmark, Thelma Ritter , Richard Kiley and Jean Peters and enthusiastically directed  by Samuel Fuller.<br /><br />I rate PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET an enthusiastic Five Stars.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|This was another exciting Iron Man film. Robert Downey Jr. was excellent as Tony Stark. I enjoyed this movie and thought the special effects were awesome.
B002ZG974M|4.0|This is an extremely interesting documentary.  There is no narration, and there is no dialog.  What it does have is an unusual approach to showing us what it's like to be a baby in four different cultures: Japan, Mongolia, USA, and Namibia.<br /><br />The film starts wtih the birth of four babies and then follows them through their early lives until they are able to walk or stand, since that is by some definitions of when being a baby ends and being a toddler begins.<br /><br />I was amazed by the differences in living conditions, cultures, and experiences these four babies had.  They range from literally spending most of their time outside (Namibia), to an interesting mix of modern and traditional (Mongolia), to living largely protected and scheduled lives (Tokyo and San Francisco).<br /><br />If you have had children of your own you will recognize some of the traditional landmarks that babies pass through: birth, rolling over, discovering their bodies, being too tired to fall asleep, interactions with siblings and parents, moving to solid foods, teething, talking, and walking.<br /><br />Note: You should be advised that there is a lot of cultural and some maternal nudity in the show.<br /><br />Recommended.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This was an excellent movie. I loved this movie from the very beginning and will buy this. I am not into the books, But I should do love the movies. I will definately buy this movie.

B002ZCY7QY|4.0|I enjoyed this latest season of Chuck, and having it available on Blu-Ray really makes it worth the price. It had more extras than the previous seasons (especially season 1) and really was creatively put together.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|great knife, i just received it and first the picture shown by amazon is wrong ( for the best) because the picture is of the bk2 1 gen and the one reeived is the 2nd gen  which comes with the exposed pommel ( to use it to drive the point of the knife into something by hammering on the back of the knife.  Did some pretty extensive reaserch on the knife and believe me it is all true.  this is not a fine work knife but is a great wood procesing, cooking, hamering, chopping knife.  the best duo is a mora knife and the becker bk2, along with a folding saw.    flat grind, the sheath is a great inproovement from the old one, it can be used either on the rightside or left.  or you can purchase a tek lok and use it scout style. the weight is awesome....i can just hold the knife all day long. this weekend I am testing it.  As a recommendation you should purchase a something to tighten the scales just in case they get loose.     the handle is made in a way that you can hold the knife way back for chopping and it still feels ecure in your hand.  I have large hands and it feels very confortable.    crovan steel 1095, 2o degrees angle, flat grind although have seen videos of peole that have changed the profile to a convex grind.    came pretty sharp not razor but pretty charp nevertheless. cant wait to use the knife this weekend

B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Nice Case.  Doesn't slip off my belt or even my jean pocket.  It gives good protection and it's really well made.  I had a little trouble at first fitting my Plantonics BlueTooth in the case at first.  You have to push down a little on it, but not a big problem. I'm fussy and want everything to fit just right.  I would recommend this little case.  Your BlueTooth won't fall out because of the magnetic closure.  I am confident that my bluetooth is well protected by it.
0525951652|4.0|I have read almost all of Follett's books, and thoroughly enjoyed almost all of them. Naturally, I bought this one the day it came out. I am now half way through. I am \\"reading\\" the audiobook, a habit that I have contracted during years of long commuting. by the way: the reader is excellent, although he indulges a bit on the foreign accents: is it really necessary?  Anyway, what to say about this book? it is in perfect Follett style: the three P's: PLOT PLOT PLOT, well designed and thrilling in a wonderfully researched environment and an interesting historical period. language is sharp and without frills. Characters are a bit roughly designed, cut with an axe instead of chiseled, but less so than in the \\"pillars\\" where villains were horrible and the good guys were saints. Follett is no psychologist, we knew that. In the end though it is like going to the safety of your usual cereal bowl every morning: you have selected it over the years, you love it and enjoy it but no surprises. This is an excellent product you can trust, but at this time in Follett's production, I would have loved more of a twist. Maybe it will come in the second half. and do not misunderstand me: I recommend it to anyone who loves good stories.
031250926X|5.0|I bought this book for my 3 1/2 year old son. He loves the story, and when I saw this version of the book I just had to buy it. The window slides to the picture of what the animal sees, and it is very sturdy and constructed well. I think it will hold up quite nicely and I can't wait to read along with my son. This is one of those stories that every young child should read.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I've read countless times again and again how much the Meat Industry is contributing to Global Warming - so much that by simply \\"opting out\\" of entire spectrum & choosing to lead a plant based diet - can reduce green house gas emissions so vastly that it is far greater than any other of these idealism's that Gore even mentions. Was it too perplexing for this man to even bring up such a simple and prevalent idea, or is he also guilty of being oblivious to the on-sight crisis at hand?
B003U53GK8|5.0|we are addicted to LOST...silly as it is.  we were getting the discs on netflix, but season 6 was not out yet.  after purchasing a roku box, which came with a $certificate for amazon VOD....i was able to purchase season 6 for a great price.  ahhhh, no waiting for netflix to acquire rights. LOST is very well done for a tv show.....but it is an addiction.
B002U6DVQM|5.0|I figure everyone who is purchasing this is already familiar with the nature of 81/2 and it's massive impact on film-making and it being one of the progenitors of the new wave film style that produced such amazing films as Chinatown and Breathless(one of which doesn't have a much-deserved Criterion treatment). Anyway, the transfer looks amazing. Just because this film is in black and white doesn't mean it can't pop and this is a thoughtful, well-done transfer. With that having been said, high-def isn't always friendly to some of the older methods of production design and, ahem, makeup and some of the flaws and unnaturally pale complexions of the actors become abundantly clear. Still, those are minor complaints and I hope Criterion continues to embrace blu-ray and allow for classics such as [[ASIN:B003KGBIRK Videodrome (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]](or movies like Chasing Amy for some reason)to get such a great update.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|This is way deeper than cynics would expect.  I watch the performances over again like classic films.  I am tired of the realitards that dominate cheap TV today.  repackaging crap that sucked the first time is the Hollywood way.  Sons of Anarchy puts a modern spin on classic themes -- this show may appeal across demographic markers.  Stellar cast.
B003TXSF5C|2.0|There werre definitely no zingers to be found and I think the title should be \\"Toward a Grand Design\\" or \\"At This Point We Really Don't Know If There's Grand Design But We're Got Some Theories\\" because the authors really didn't eclipse what one could find in Wikipedia.  I read this on a Kindle3 and I was disappointed to see the illustrations difficult to read (resolution too low) and cut-off (they were slightly too wide for the Kindle).  The resolution of the Kindle is not the issue, but rather the publisher's production.
B001GKYBXA|1.0|When I bought this CD, I didnt have very high expectations.  I had heard the first single (Sing The Changes) over the internet and thought it sounded bad.  Well, the entire CD is just as bad as the single.  What was Paul thinking when he recorded this?  The production is awful and the songs are very forgettable.  He released a couple of these songs live, performed by his own band (Sing The Changes and Highway).  The live versions are worlds better than the studio versions on this CD.  His vocals are buried in the mix on this CD.<br /><br />If you are a Beatles or Paul McCartney collector, then it is a CD you must buy, but I assure you, it will collect dust on the shelf.  It is painful to listen to this CD from start to finish, unless you are looking for background music to put you to sleep, and even then.....<br /><br />This is by far Paul's worst release.  I do not recommend it.
B001GCUER0|5.0|Well, now I know what the fuss is all about. This series is fantastic--- from the set designs and wardrobe to the writing---an intelligent soap opera historically set in the 1960s!  I keep looking for inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the sets, etc. So, far there are none!
159562015X|5.0|This book and the associated test/assessment are very valuable for learning the advantages of utilizing and capitalizing on one's strengths rather than fixing weaknesses.  I provide one for each new addition at work and most share their strength profile with the group.  It has shown to be a good motivator and a great way to focus employees on what they are best at.    This book, \\"Stengths Finder 2.0\\", has a better, more up-to-date test and results reporting but for a little more detail on the philosophy and background you might consider \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\".
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|GREAT MOVIE, SHE'S GROWING UP TO BE A REALLY GOOD ACTRESS. THE MOVIE CAME REALLY FAST, THANKS!
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|I just have to say that I am greatly enjoying this new addition to the already terrific Satch collection.  I bought the CD in advance of its actual release, as purchasing any new-release Satriani CD for me is simply a given.  Joe Satriani is by far my favorite musician and I have been a huge fan of Joe's for many years (since the 'Not Of This Earth' era).  I find each of his CD's to be extremely enjoyable and unique.  In this CD and like always, Joe always gives a spectacular performance, and Joe's range of style does grow over time.  His work in this batch is definitely distinct and once again fantastic.    As always, you can immediately recognize Joe's incredible, uniquely exciting and astonishing guitar playing in all of the songs in this CD.  His technique, tone, composition quality, and expressive style are easily the most talented and musically developed in the world.  All of the songs on the CD are truly stunning in their sonics and feel.  I hear new things in these songs with almost every listen - the sonic layering and creative texturing is wonderful.      Some comments on specific songs from this CD: \\"Premonition\\" is classic Joe and makes a great choice for the first-song for the CD.  \\"The Golden Room\\" is jaw-droppingly good, and you will also notice that it is extremely aptly named!  \\"Dream Song\\" is a genuine blast and will engage you right away.  \\"Pyrrhic Victoria\\" is an extremely fun experience - and by its name, I imagine it perhaps describes the attitude of a woman he knows with a self-destructive ego?  \\"Littleworth Lane\\" is a wonderful and bluesy piece that is just loaded with feeling.  \\"Wormhole Wizards\\" is absolutely brilliant and seems almost alive in its soundspace!  \\"Light Years Away\\" may describe the daydreaming sensation, and causes you to feel immersed in enjoyment of this song (the driving bass line is worth mentioning here as well).  \\"Solitude\\" is a short but highly moving solo piece that will so capture your attention, it defies description.  \\"Two Sides To Every Story\\" is a jazzy-rock gem that will definitely bring you a smile and make your feet tap.  \\"Wind In The Trees\\" is mind-blowingly incredible, with literally the most amazing and emotionally moving guitar work I've possibly ever heard in my life.  \\"God is Crying\\" is also just unbelievably good, another actual \\"touches your soul\\" piece like the previously mentioned songs, and which Joe somehow so consistently produces.  I don't know how a human being can do this - somehow Joe is able to let his heart and soul genuinely sing and communicate through his guitar and compositions.  I can't believe how lucky we all are to be able to hear and experience this artist's invaluable gifts of music to the world.    When I bought this CD, I didn't know about the \\"Best Buy\\" exclusive version which contains the two additional songs!  After hearing these songs online in MP3 version, I've since ordered the \\"Best Buy\\" version CD so I can also have these two additional outstanding songs also in CD-quality.    I'm definitely (and obviously) happy as can be with this CD.  I also really appreciate the new bass work here of Allen Whitman, and Jeff Campitelli on drums is absolutely fantastic once again as well.  Both Joe Satriani and Mike Keneally each contributed to the keyboard elements on this CD (perhaps on all songs?).  At first, I wasn't quite sure about the subtly-new type of keyboard sound in this CD (Joe's earlier CD's often featured what I consider amazing sounding keyboard work also), but after several listens, I've come to truly appreciate how well this new sound integrates and undeniably contributes to these musical masterpieces in this CD.    Please Joe, keep releasing your amazing music, which as you know brings immeasurable enjoyment to myself and all of your many true fans.  Thank you so much!
B002ZG9968|5.0|REAL CUTE MOVIE A MUST SEE! THANKS, FOR GETTING THE MOVIE TO ME SO FAST!
B0034G4OVS|2.0|First let me say that I am one of those people who can fall upstairs.  Trees and rocks have been know to find me when I walk or ride a bike.  I also live in Kansas, the FLAT part of Kansas.  This means that going down a snow covered hill very fast has no appeal to me. All this made it hard for me to get excited about the movie FROZEN.   I teach  film studies and our next assignment was to be a film critic.  We discussed the duties of a film critic and so on, so I decided to use this film as the film for them to review.  Since the film had a very short run in theatres and hadn't been seen by the kids, I thought it would be a great one for them to use.  The bottem line is this I found myself watching the film closer looking at how it was made,ie. camera angles, music, set, fx, and watching the reactions of my students.     It was a new experience for me, I was taking notes in the dark about the movie on one pad and notes about the kids' reaction on another pad.  Thank Heaven the movie was only 93 minutes long.    First thing I noticed was that I didn't \\"click\\" with the characters.  Their opening dialogue seemed strained and fake.  The male friend compaining to his buddy that the girl was taking away from their guy time just fell flat.  Now if I can not find something in the characters to like then I have no emotional reason to care what happens to them.  This first part got a chuckle and snickering from the kids.  It seemed that a lot time was taken in the first part of the movie at talking about feelings and the male friend finding a girl.  I know that the scene where the boys \\"make\\" the girl get the lift guy to let them on is a set up for later, but this scene and the way the guys \\"shamed\\" the girl into doing it seemed sleazy.    The dialogue is the main thing that \\"killed\\" this mvoie.  For example, when they first realize that they are trapped on the lift, what do they talk about?  The different ways to die!  Another time is when the boyfriend is spread out on theground with his legs 90 degrees from his body with a bone sticking out of his leg, what do they say?  Are you alright?  The effect is one of out and out laughter by the kids.  This mistake underminds  the guy on the ground and what is about to happen to him.  The two in the lift don't just ask this stupid questin once but several times even when the wolves are busy with the boy friend.    The music does nothing to help the movie.  The back ground music is classical in nature and does not fit what is happening on the screen.  I found myself aware it when I should have been paying attentin to the movie.    I may not ski but I do known about snow and cold and so do my students.   This was judged to be the greatest mistake of all in the movie.  The movie takes place at night  during bad snow snow storm and we all noticed the following things:  1.  When the characters talked, the was no puffs of \\"smoke\\" that would be there if warm breath met cold air.  2.  At first when they were trapped and the night turned into a blizzard they didn't shiver.  3.  The scene when the male friend tries to climb the cable that there was no ice on it.  There was ice on everything else but not here.  4.  They didn't try to huddle for warmth.  Come on now.  5.  There is a wind and their clothes don't move in it.  6.  The girl is the only one to get frost bite.  Why?      But not all was bad.  The director of the movie, Adam Green, also did the movie Hachet.  My kids said this was gross horror mvoie and they liked it.  The scene where the boyfriend jumps is the one scene we watched two or three times because the first part and first reaction was the strongest part of the mvoie.  We noticed that this was well done at first.  The kids said oh the blood but there wasn't any.  The director wisely stage this in such away that the kids' imagination added to the scene what wasn't there.  this was very effective.  But on second viewing things began to come out.  One was why didn't the guy faint?  Whenlooking at the position of the guy the second time the kids noticed that the body and the legs were not in proportion  and at wrong angles.    The action scenes are well done and exciting.  The kids responded to these.  It was the parts in between that they hated.  And this is the director's fault.  He also worte the film.    The end!!!!!  Well I can not repeat the words that the kids said about the end.  they felt that they had spent 93 minutes of exciting action and dumb dialogue and they got that ending!  I don't even want to tell you the ending.    So I would not rent this movie.  If some else rented and asked you come see it...well if is that or taking out the trash, you might want to think long and hard before making decision.    P.S. I am writing this in the classroom and answering questions about the movie so forgive for any errors in grammar.

I have kept it off, and I am sure that has saved my life.<br /><br />It is essential to stay on Atkins in order to maintain the weight. And there is a lot to know about it to do that. I have read and read and read! I recently saw this book recommended and ordered it. I am close to the end of it now. And WOW!<br /><br />It is true to the Atkins plans, but adds some information from research that has been done since Atkins' last book in 2002. A lot of this I had figured out--including, in just about the past year, that I needed to supplement my salt. Wow, did I have leg cramps! But not after I upped the salt a bit.<br /><br />And there are lots more very accurate, very clearly written details in this book that make it really good to read.<br /><br />This book can make your life lots better.

0375714839|5.0|I have read both the original French version of this graphic novel and the English version as well. I loved them both. When I had first heard about the grapic novels, I was a French student at the time and in the most advanced class at my high school. I read it thinking it's going to be like some anime book with mainly pictures, but there is indeed a lot of words and discussion in it too. If you are not a native French speaker or  do not speak French, the English translation is very accurate and will still engross you in the two-part series.<br /><br />This book also opened my eyes more to the perspective of an Iranian girl growing up in times of such turmoil. About how she's divided between two lives, the one in Europe, and the one in Iran. In the words of a Sheryfa Luna song \\"Je suis d'ici et d'ailleurs\\" meaning I am from here and elsewhere strongly applies to Satrapi's mindset in these books and in her life of course.<br /><br />All in all, to those looking for a great political and graphic novel to read, I highly recommend these books.
0143112724|5.0|A friend gave me this illustrated edition of Strunk and White's classic a few years ago. I have been grateful ever since, and have tried to return the favor by giving it as a gift to others in my turn. (It's a rare and happy moment in any writer's life when she gets to give a guide to proper grammar that recipients will actually welcome with a smile.)<br /><br />I would never have thought that this book needed illustration; in fact, I think I would have wondered what in the world the illustrations could possibly be represent. Yet Kalman's images work with it effortlessly, perhaps because they offer a counterpoint to the prose rather than an attempt to depict it literally. I didn't see the \\"exuberant, rioutously colorful\\" quality referenced in \\"booklover 10's\\" review here on Amazon; though they are certainly colorful, the images seem more subtle than that to me, always whimsical but sometimes a bit plaintive, if also sometimes obviously funny. Much of the appeal of this particular marriage of authors and illustrator is the disjunction between the text's emphasis on detail and accuracy and Kalman's deliberately naive and simplified (yet always resonant) renderings.<br /><br />I guess you could say that I've had to do an about-face: hard as it was to imagine the book with illustrations before this edition, I now find it almost impossible to imagine it without them. This book also inspired me to explore some of Kalman's other work; those who enjoyed the illustrations here may also find her [[ASIN:1594202672 And the Pursuit of Happiness]]and [[ASIN:0143116460 The Principles of Uncertainty]]a pleasure, as I did.
B003XL6EKS|3.0|As a fairly huge Killers fan, I bought this CD with excitement and anticipation. B-Flow doesn't entirely disappoint, that's not what i'm trying to say. However, there is something lacking on this album. Some songs sound hollow and all too fragmented, while his frequently utilized upper vocal register fades into the background during some tracks. That, or he squeals the notes to the point where they sound irritating or piercing (listen to \\"Was it Something I Said?\\"). Many of the songs seems to be going somewhere, then dissolve before reaching their peak. The better tracks: \\"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\\" (a heartfelt ode to his hometown), \\"Hard Enough\\" (a bit hollow, but his voice blends well with Jenny Lewis'), \\"Jilted Lovers and Broken Hearts\\" (will sound a bit more familiar to Killers fans), \\"Magdalena\\" (poetic and simplistic, doesn't over-do it in the upper vocal register, easily my favorite track on the album), and one of the bonus tracks, \\"The Clock Was Tickin'\\" (a solid attempt at a country-esque tune, works well with his voice). Many of the other tracks are just okay to me, nothing that I truly detest, but it's certainly not what I expected when I heard Brandon Flowers was to release a solo album. If you're a big Killers fan and you're going to buy the CD no matter what I say, more power to ya, you might enjoy it. All I can say is that I hope he gets back together with the Killers realll soon. As a group, they are something else.
0345505387|4.0|Just sharing a few thoughts about the new Outlander graphic novel. Warning: If you haven't read the original Outlander, this review contains a few spoilers.<br /><br />I'd never read a graphic novel before and I found it took some getting used to. Sometimes I couldn't tell in which order the dialogue was spoken and I was disappointed that the characters' faces were not drawn with the same detail throughout the novel as they were in the beginning of the story, but I'm supposing that's how it goes: the artist gives you a couple of very detailed, complete pictures of Jamie and Claire so you'll know what they look like, but doesn't keep up that level of detail throughout the rest of the novel, focusing more on the action shots. Thus sometimes Jamie and Claire looked like cartoon characters. But, oh, those first few frames of Jamie are awesome!! You can click on the cover photo and browse through the pages on Amazon.<br /><br />The story begins with Murtaugh bringing Jamie home from the abby in France where he recuperated from the ax blow to his head. They meet up with Dougal to make the trip back to Castle Leoch and then along comes Claire and we know what happens from there. There's a new element to the story, though, and it involves Murtaugh and a mysterious, naked man who appears from out of nowhere, and Murtaugh, being highly superstitious, believes him to be a faery demon. But this fellow keeps popping up and soon it becomes evident to the reader that he is a fellow Traveler who's come through the standing stones. This new subplot has no real bearing on the Outlander story, so it doesn't change anything we already know, just adds another layer to it and helps give a little more insight into Murtaugh's mind. The story ends with Claire choosing Jamie at Craigh na dun and our happy couple riding into the sunset toward Lallybroch.<br /><br />I gobble up anything Outlander-related, so I pre-ordered this as soon as I was able to do so. Based on story and read-ability I'd rate it 3 stars, because I did find it rather confusing, the addition of the new subplot was nothing special, and the bare bones storyline does not do justice to the original book, but the artwork is beautiful and it's \\"coolness\\" factor earns it 5 stars, so I'm splitting the difference and calling this one 4 stars. I don't think it's going to end up a beloved classic, but if you're a devoted Outlander fan you've got to add this to your collection.se I did find it rather confusing, the addition of the new subplot was nothing special, and the bare bones storyline does not do justice to the original book, but the artwork is beautiful and it's \\"coolness\\" factor earns it 5 stars, so I'm splitting the difference and calling this one 4 stars.

It's a classic nowadays and it's simply flawless, exquisite and of course devastating! all elements are in this disc... energy, screaming heavy metal with a dose of power/thrash metal, powerfull and catchy riffs, doble bass drum and the lyrics that drives you to another reality with a touch of madness, chaos and war..but hopefully there is the PAINKILLER to save all mandkind.. just great!     I Think this is the best Priest album, of course we have great records like STAINED CLASS, RAM IT DOWN, DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH to name a few, and this records were the evolution process to reach THIS awesome album.    From head to toe, from Painkiller to Leather Rebel (Live) at the remastered version, I think this is the map, the highway, the Bible to any band who wants to play PURE, FAST and ANGRY HEAVY METAL!        This record is mandatory, it can't be out of your collection.    Long Live To The Priest!
B002N5N5M0|4.0|I have given this fourth series 4 stars but in truth some editions deserved 5, others 2.     Unfortunately, to make the plot work we are asked to believe a number of things that are very unlikely, and also accept just too many co-incidences. The middle of the season is not good, the on-going main plot protracted, and we see a 'weak' Dexter which is not, I believe, the programme's strength.    Without giving away plot lines, I have to sum it up by saying that the season's last edition made me believe it was 'all over'. I was amazed there is a FIFTH season ~ and fear it may stretch my disbelief even further.    But despite all this, Michael C. Hall, is serving up some of the best television with a show that still manages to shock !
0307474712|5.0|One of the best book I have ever read.  Excellent writing.  Couldn't wait to read the ending which was just so beautiful.  Buy it or borrow it.
0316098337|3.0|I've got no problem with the story line here.  It is interesting and unique.<br /><br />I can't wrap my head around the voice.  I'm sorry but it just is not credible.  A five year old would not have the vocabulary used, nor would they be able to articulate in detail things from when they were two years old.<br /><br />Ultimately, I found the incongruity too difficult to overcome.  They detracted from the enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />If you get this book just be prepared for the voice - maybe you could be more forgiving.
0887306667|3.0|I heard about this book through some friends and I've had it awhile. I just read it recently since I'm taking a marketing class in college. There are some contradictions in the book and to what I've learned in class.   Ex: The Law of Line Extension says not to extend a brand name to many products so as to not weaken the brand, whereas in class, the instructor and the textbook say that's not a bad idea, especially if you already have a good product with a good brand name, extend it so that consumers will associate the already existing brand name and that brand's attributes with a new product.  Also, the author predicted that Microsoft should stick to developing operating systems. At the time (~1994) Microsoft was venturing into word processing, database and spreadsheet programs. Microsoft was a low player in all those at the time and it would ultimately fail if it ventured into those new areas where other companies already dominated the market. Today, Microsoft Office, which includes all those programs, is the most successful in all those categories.  Even with the dated examples, a lot of which are wrong and do not apply today, I think the basic ideas aren't all that bad. Maybe with current examples, this would be a lot better book. Probably wouldn't be a bad idea for some small businesses to actually follow through with all the laws until it's well established, but the laws shouldn't be considered laws.
B003VS0CYC|5.0|ok so got this in today and let me start out with this people ask if this is the unrated/criterion edition got this from imdb  Runtime:  102 min    Germany: 78 min (cut version)    Norway: 98 min (cut version)    USA: 103 min (unrated director's cut)    Finland: 91 min (heavily cut)     the first is is 103 minutes so it's the unrated.    Now on to the dvd if you want it in hd i'm afraid its the same as the first. Heck even the disc is the same looking as the first release one.    What is cool is the boxart is slim and the artwork on the front and back is nice looking.  This is cool all 3 dvd's come in one standard blu-ray box so it is very slim.    I would say for the price,look and slim size this is well worth buying
B000AMJC2K|4.0|It is OK for the bucks (not excellent though).  You need some tunings for each joint to make it work.
0307454541|1.0|How can such a bad book get so many good reviews.  I'm trying to stay with the story and read it to the end but, after reading all the 1 star reviews of people who feel the same way as I do, I am ditching it today.  My aunt bought the same book and when I asked her if she was enjoying it, she said it was terrible.  She stopped reading it halfway through.  Now I feel that I cannot trust any of the 5 star reviews on Amazon.  I'd like to find a website where I can trust the ratings.
0307270807|5.0|Book received quickly and at a great price. Good read, the confusion of war comes through crystal clear.
B0041VV03A|1.0|Way too much purposeless gore.  Completely unsympathetic and unlikable moronic characters who were totally unbelievable as scientists.  To top it all off a disgusting mutant rape scene and completely predictable ending.<br /><br />Another reviewer said it best, \\"That's two hours of my life I'll never get back!\\"
0525423842|5.0|I really loved the fact that Theo went to his uncle Ike for help and listened to advice. It's a myth that a child must solve his own problems. I've written short stories for children's magazines. The stories would be returned with the criticism that I COULD NOT HAVE AN ADULT HELP THE CHILD ESPECIALLY A MOTHER if I put her in a parental role.      Congratulations Mr. Grisham for having Theo have the wisdom to know that a 13 year can't solve everything on his own.   A trusted adult or parent is the right person to go to for help. IT IS A MYTH THAT HAVING ADULTS ESPECIALLY PARENTS GIVE COUNCIL IS GOING TO RUIN THE STORY.    Editors, you are not in charge of how to raise children to be safe, happy and productive adults.  Anybody that's raised kids knows that.  So stop making rules and judgement calls about what adults can say or do in a child's book.

0439023513|1.0|While waiting for the final in the series, I read the Gregor the Overlander books to my 8-year-old son. LOVED THEM.   However, for some reason, reading them spoiled Mockingjay for me. I kept seeing similarities to the Gregor books. Not sure if that's if I had just read them, or because SC was lost with what to do with Katniss. I kept seeing Gregor in her.   I just couldn't get into Mockingjay. I borrowed it from a friend, and the first two books I read in two days-- this book I had for two weeks, and had to force myself to finish it. It dragged. I think she should have ended at Catching Fire. Or something. I just wouldn't recommend this one.
B002VECM6S|5.0|purchased used...was as good as new!  VERY happy with the seller, and I adore the movie!!!
0316098337|5.0|My recommendation for this book is don't read anything about it.  Don't read the reviews, don't read the dust jacket, don't read the tags ... Just pick up the book.<br /><br />What you need to know:<br />It's disturbing and discomposing<br />It's brilliantly executed<br />It's dark, but beautiful too<br />Don't start it at night, because you won't want to put it down<br />If you have to put it down, you will be thinking about it while you aren't reading it<br />It's probably not something you've given a lot of thought too
0385342047|2.0|I usually enjoy Sophie Kinsella's books for some light reading and a few laughs. The Shopaholic series generally provides just that. The main character in the series, Becky, is usually portrayed as a slightly ditzy but also a fairly likeable character. In this book, however, I found myself utterly annoyed with Becky.    The book is set in the midst of the recent financial meltdown. Becky's husband Luke is under pressure at work, they and their toddler, Minnie, are living with her parents, and Luke's birthday is approaching, creating a 'stressy' situation for Becky.  The serious nature of the financial crisis that many people experienced is not a good match for the silliness and irresponsibility of Becky's flighty spending habits and attempts to 'cut back'. In addition, her daughter is indeed a spoiled brat and Becky is portrayed as a pretty crappy parent. Usually you can find something warm to cuddle up to in her character, but not this time.     This book attempted to make light of some serious issues. It probably could've been done with a little more finesse, but in this case the attempt failed. The usual loveability of Becky was missing; hence the two stars for what was ultimately a massive downer.

B003Y8YXH6|5.0|I would have gladly paid the price for a single cd release of the stripped down version. However, they have given us a bonus disc of a remastered version of the album in it's original mix. This is great news for those that are not buying the 'Signature' boxed set, as they plan to cherry pick their fave albums. I do have the boxed set on order but have agreed not to open it until Christmas as it, and the Lennon Box of Vision, are a gift :)<br /><br />I read somewhere that Lennon never felt that he had a great voice and felt he had to add reverb etc. The man had an amazing rock voice and his vocals on this stripped down version are a testament to that fact. Great job Yoko and staff!!

B003UYV08E|3.0|IRON MAN II.  May he rest in peace. As with so many of these Marvel Comics scripts there are so many add-on characters to disrupt the meager storyline that it seems like the studio tapped everyone who walked by the filming, gave them a few lines and a wow costume and said 'come one in.' Rating an obvious millions of dollars production such as this is duplicitous: CGI 5, acting 3, story 1.  But if noise, mayhem, and electrical fires are pleasing to you, then by all means jump aboard this colorful film.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr. is a fine actor so he puts as much as he can into the lines allotted him to read.  Mickey Rourke is the bad guy with even more tattoos and longer hair than the Wrestler, and with a Russian accent to boot.  Don Cheadle plays Don Cheadle, and Sam Rockwell needs a shave as a supposed wily bad guy executive. Samuel L. Jackson attempts to lend some dignity.  Gwyneth Paltrow seems to be asking why she bothered until Scarlett Johansson jumps on board to give the film some much need punch.  It's good guy versus bad guy - with drones create by Rourke's disenchanted character that attempt unsuccessfully to turn the tide.  What's missing is some of Robert Downey, Jr.'s comedic banter and the brakes put on the destruction of the Stark Expo concept.  Definitely a film for those who like this sort of high volume comic book outing.  Grady Harp, October 10
0553805371|4.0|Granted that many are saying Hawking didn't quite disprove \\"God\\" in this book; however, he did give enough information to move god out of realm. The concepts that some religious groups follow state that God interferes with our world at all times. In Hawking's book, we are given enough information to show that if there is a God, he certainly has no need to play with his own rules in our reality - leaving him out of the problem.
B0021L8V1Q|1.0|I absolutely LOVED Iron Man One, one of the best movies I've seen - couldn't wait to buy Iron Man 2.  Even bought the Blu Ray edition.. Had a party to watch it.... almost everybody left.  I want my money back.  What a rip... The dialogue was horrible, too long, childish, made no sense.  The plot could've been great if carried out, but Mickey Rourke was horrible and Gwyneth Paltrow, a CEO, come on.  A few of the scenes were good but the writing was so ridiculous, like I said, everybody I invited over left the room except for me and I regretted watching it to the end... I sure hope there is NOT an Iron Man 3, or if there is, get some new writers.  When are people going to stop supporting these Hollywood nut cases and quit being taken as suckers, me being one of them.

1848566190|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo35HMZZPQ07R8R]]It's really great to see Drew Struzan's art in one wonderful volume. All those that I've seen before were in different making-of and art-of books, particularly the Star Wars books. This book has much more than that.<br /><br />There are works dating back to the from the first Indiana Jones movie (1981), Star Wars (he drew for all of them), Back to the Future, Shawshank Redemption, Police Academy, Hellboy and a few movies which I didn't know existed. Going through this book made me feel like watching all those movies again. A very nostalgic collection.<br /><br />The paintings are gorgeous, nicely reproduced, and many printed full page. Also included are many variations of the movie posters, both in sketches and colours, and all almost as detailed as the final piece.<br /><br />There's some sort of magical quality in his paintings that evoke a sense of fantasy and adventure. Together with his traditional approach to art, he has created a style that's easily recognisable. Every page is a marvel to look at, to admire.<br /><br />Besides the art, Drew Struzan himself provided some commentary on the background stories and working with people. It's all very interesting to read.<br /><br />This is definitely one of the top art books for 2010.<br /><br />You probably do not want to miss this fantastic book.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B0015DROBO|5.0|As soon I starting reading \\"Men who hate women\\" aka \\"The girl with the dragon tattoo\\" I couldn't stop. I like reading about the books I'm about to read because I want to know what I'm about to embark on. The reviews for this book were generally good but there were a handfull of bad reviews. Even though I can see why someone might not like a long start to a crime/detective/ mystery novel I must say I find it only builds up the suspense. I did not find this book needlessly long. It is however not a book for just any occasional mystery novel reader. The book plays in Sweden so it's very helpful to know a bit more about this country. I find that reading a bit on Sweden's political and financial affairs (like on wikipedia) helps the story come more alive. It's important to at least know that Sweden is a nation that has ranked in the top 10 best countries to live in and also among the top 10 with the least gender inequity according to the UN Human Development Report 2007/2008. This of course is a great contrast with the center plot of the book and thus with the original Swedish titel. I found it a very interesting book and I am definitely going to be reading the other 2 books of the series. If you like mystery, though smart women, an under dog story, and have a socio-political interest then this book is definitely for you.<br /><br />These are some links to the UN Human Development Report 2007/2008 (most recent they are based on data from 2007)<br />[...]

B001G9F9IW|4.0|No one seems to have mentioned it here, so at the risk of stating the obvious I will say it:  This is Woody Allen's remake/re-imagining of Truffaut's Jules and Jim.  The bike ride to the picnic is a dead give-away, as is the narration.  Watch that classic movie again and you will get more out of this one.  That being said, I enjoyed this movie even before this dawned on me.  On the surface, it's about beautiful people in beautiful locations involved in artistic pursuits.  Basically, the fantasy life of any thinking person who wants something other than the shallow pop culture that we are continually inundated with.  Yet somehow all the major characters wind up unhappy or unsatisfied.  That may be ultimate message: it's the journey not the destination, because there is no destination where we will be happy for good.

0671015206|5.0|A truly encouraging book that provides a simple formula to being becoming a millionaire. His formula is basically get educated, work, save, be frugal, invest wisely, and live below your means. This way you can accumulate money over time. His definition of wealth is how many months one can survive without a job. If you can survive 20 months, then that's your wealth. If you can survive without a job indefinitely, well, then you have made it. The author sites countless examples of people who exceed a million dollar in saving from their salary. What a person needs to learn is to become a PAW (Prodigious Accumulator of Wealth). The opposite to that is living beyond your means and spending beyond your income and end up being an accumulator of debt instead of an accumulator of wealth. This is a highly recommended book for anyone who aspires to become financially independent and even accumulate a million or more by the age of 40. Is it possible? Perhaps. Others have done it.

B003AO1SVS|5.0|After hearing much hype, particularly surrounding the album [[ASIN:B0013K6WLM Attack and Release]], I decided to finally purchase a Black Keys album.  After purchasing and listening to the exceptional [[ASIN:B003AO1SVS Brothers]],  I found myself wanting to `kick myself' for not purchasing and getting into The Black Keys sooner.  There is not a dull moment on this effort, which finds superb, bluesy arrangements/productions executed by the band and superb, bluesy vocals sang by frontman Dan Auerbach. ' Brothers' is Grammy-worthy by all means, and I hope that the band receives a nod for this finely constructed effort.<br /><br />\\"Everlasting Life\\" opens up the album off to a brilliant start, finding a nice soulful, bluesy groove setting the tone for the cut and the album itself.  Here, a folk-roots rock connection is alluded to given the use of tambourine, mixed with a minimalistic groove.  Auerbach's vocals are exceptional, adding a soulful dimension to this indie-rock cut.  Follow-up \\"Next Girl\\" is equally alluring, keeping the `roots-rock' feel alive.  The songwriting is superb, with a simple, but enjoyable hook: \\"my next girl, will be nothing like my ex-girl/I made mistakes back then, I'll never do it again.\\" Also noteworthy is that The Black Keys have a great feel for the importance of space in a song, and they do not rush the pacing of the lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Tighten Up\\" features exceptional gritty lead vocals by Dan Auerbach (kudos to the vocal production work here) and another well developed, standout groove.  The guitars sound top-notch throughout, playing a big contributing factor to the effectiveness of the cut, not to mention a taste of organ.  \\"Howlin' For You\\" keeps up the pace with a clich&eacute; drum groove that works great here.  The use of keyboards here add even more to the consummate musicianship of The Black Keys. \\"Howlin' for You\\" is as consistent as everything else. \\"She's Long Gone\\" features a superb guitar solo, easily channeling the sound and vibe of blues-rock and classic rock and roll.  \\"Black Mud,\\" an instrumental cut, fits perfectly into the pacing and overall feel of this album, allowing this musically talented group to show off their great skill.<br /><br />\\"The Only One\\" is another well mixed/engineered number.  Here, Auerbach's vocals are hushed here, contrasting his usually overt vocals.  The band remains focused on minimalist progressions and grooves, adding tasteful touches of other instrumentation and sounds to vary the overall timbre.  \\"Too Afraid To Love You\\" features a nice full bass line and a completely different timbre - aided greatly through the keyboard work.  Auerbach's vocals are fully present and overt as ever on this cut where there is really nothing to quibble about.<br /><br />\\"Ten Cent Pistol\\" continues the band's thriving on simple harmonic progressions.  Organ and bluesy guitar playing help to shape this cut.  \\"Sinister Kid\\" features the prodigious knack of spacing by the band, not to mention more superb production work and songwriting.  \\"The Go Getter\\" is an oddity, though in a positive sense, as the groove takes a couple of seconds to really settle in the listener's ears.  Here, the groove changes, which is a nice effect. \\"I'm Not The One\\" is a solid as everything else, though not necessarily as creative.<br /><br />\\"Unknown Brother\\" shows some brilliant guitar work, with the constantly repeating riff standing out.  This cut has a happier vibe than previous cuts, marking a nice change of pace.  Soul cover \\"Never Gonna Give Up\\" finds the band intelligently recreating the 1970s soul sound nearly perfectly. Auerbach's vocals capture the grit of 1970s soul superbly here.  Closing cut \\"These Days\\" slows down the tempo and finds Auerbach's once overt vocals once again withdrawn (though always nuanced).  The refrain here is clever, and also marks a change of intensity about the final cut: \\"These blood red eyes/don't see so good/but what's worse is if they could/would I change myways?\\" While this cut is one of the longer cuts on the album, the length does not play a factor because the band draws you into their superb, masterful performance.  \\"These Days\\" is by all means an engineering masterwork if nothing else.<br /><br />What else can you say about one of the best albums of the year? This album is at the top of my list for one of 2010's best efforts by all means.  'the longer cuts on the album, the length does not play a factor because the band draws you into their superb, masterful performance.   \\"These Days\\" is by all means an engineering masterwork if nothing else.

B002T921AC|4.0|I find that this is a good debut. I'm proud of this teen-age Canadian talent. He has talent and charisma. Thumbs up!
B003LXM1RS|4.0|Let's face it, 2006's [[ASIN:B000HCO8IQ Ta-Dah]] by the Scissor Sisters was NOT their best album.  The album had some promising and captivating moments, but overall, it was a bore compared to their nearly perfect, sexualized debut 2004's [[ASIN:B0002IQI8I Scissor Sisters]].  2010's first effort in four years, [[ASIN:B003LXM1RS Night Work]] is similarly NOT as good as their 2004 debut, but it is a better album than 'Ta-Dah' in numerous ways as it better captures the group's magic from that magnificent debut.  But it helps to have a Madonna producer on your side, right (Stuart Price)?<br /><br />\\"Night Work,\\" the title-track opens the album solidly with nice, driving electronic production work.  The track does not come over as revolutionary, mind you, though it is typical dance-pop/club music fare by all means.  The refrain is catchy and frontman Jake Shears sings with conviction, as he always has.  I prefer \\"Whole New Way,\\" over the title cut, which has a better groove and even catchier refrain: \\"I found a whole new way to love you/ I've got a big surprise, I can't see your eyes but I think you'll like it too...\\"  The songwriting is superb and as always, Shears is as potent as ever.  \\"Fire With Fire\\" keeps up a trend of `no misses' as the band changes the pace here with a slower cut.  Again, a knack for solid hooks shows here.  Additionally, instead of the production work being fully developed from the onset, the track slowly evolves adding more and more pieces to the production.<br /><br />\\"Any Which Way\\" is a nice neo-disco cut which sounds much closer to The Scissor Sisters' lauded 2004 self-titled debut.  The groove is as addictive as ever, with the only quibble being the excessive length of the cut given its constant repetition. That said, it is as enjoyable as anything else.  \\"Harder You Get,\\" a personal favorite cut, possesses yet another driving groove, finding superb use of guitar to separate this cut from the purely electronic-laden ones.  Here, the vocal production (mix) on Jake's vocals on the verse is interesting and captivating, though it is the repetitive, catchy hook (\\"harder you get...\\") that maybe the highlight of this sexualized number.  The nice touch is the vocal ad lib section where Jake sings on a neutral syllable (\\"da, da, da, da, da...\\"), adding a nice touch to the cut.<br /><br />\\"Running Out\\" is a brief cut with quick paced vocals by Shears. It does not standout among the best, but it is solid and by no means a miss.  \\"Something Like This\\" is a better cut, featuring a completely different groove that contrasts \\"Running Out.\\"  This cut, like \\"Running Out\\" does benefit from a short duration (only 3:01).  \\"Skin This Cat\\"  keeps the momentum going, finding Ana Matronic handling the vocal duties for the first time this album.  As always, the sexual under- and overtones flow naturally and this cut is as clever, overt, and sexy all all the others.<br /><br />\\"Skin Tight\\" is brief as well, but proves to be less clever and captivating than previous cuts.  What is clever, however, is the segue into proceeding cut \\"Sex and Violence,\\" another `B' cut.  What is standout about \\"Sex and Violence\\" is Shears uses the lower register of his voice, which adds another level of `seduction' to the album you might say.  \\"Sex and Violence\\" is too long, particularly after being spoiled by shorter and tighter cuts that precede it.<br /><br />\\"Night Life,\\" the penultimate cut, clocks in under 3:40 and once again finds unique production work when paired against previous cut \\"Sex and Violence.\\" The groove is uptempo here, which is somewhat a hindrance as it is hard to truly `connect' or `get-into' the verse or refrain here.  \\"Night Life\\" is a least favorite cut personally.  Closing cut  \\"Invisible Light\\" is lengthy, but atones for \\"Night Life's\\" lack of inspiration.  Here, Shears shows off his masterful falsetto on the refrain (he uses his natural voice on the verse).<br /><br />Maybe the Scissor Sisters have not completely recaptured their initial magic, but they do a better job on this album at approaching that level of musicianship and creativity.  This album is much more memorable and thoughtfully put together than the blander, forgettable 'Ta-Dah.'do a better job on this album at approaching that level of musicianship and creativity.

Sure enough, Sade's 2010 album [[ASIN:B002YIHO7I Soldier of Love]] was one of the year's biggest smashes, crashing onto the chart with 502,000.  Easily certified platinum, Soldier of Love is the year's most buzz-worthy R&B album by all means.  While Sade is by no means revolutionary on her return (save for \\"Soldier of Love\\" the single itself), Sade also sounds like she has not lost one ounce of her relevance or her ability to perform some of the most sensual music ever.  On 'Soldier of Love,' the production work tends to be stripped for the most part, evolving as each cut progresses along.  Despite being just a `solid' album, 'Soldier of Love' is a fine addition to Sade's discography and a welcomed effort after a ten-year hiatus by the British singer.<br /><br />The album opens up strongly with the moody, yet lovely \\"The Moon and the Sky,\\" finding Sade reservedly singing: \\"you'll always know the reason why, we could have had the moon and the sky, you'll always know the reason why this love, reason why this love, ain't gonna let you go\\" on the well written chorus.  While Sade may never `break a sweat' with her vocal performance here, it is polished, refined and incredibly enjoyable to `take-in.'  \\"Soldier of Love\\" may be the sole revolutionary track by Sade as far as `style' is concerned.  Here, Sade makes the closest turn to concessions to hip-hop as ever expected, with the programming-driven cut.  \\"Soldier of Love\\" is certainly one of the year's more memorable, noteworthy cuts, filled with nice sounds and sound effects that differentiate it from numerous Sade cuts of the past.  Here, Sade throws some ethnic sounding ideas, namely the catchy portion where she and a chorus of vocals chant \\"I've been torn up inside, I've been left behind, tall I rid, I have the will to survive.\\"  The album opens with tremendous momentum, given superb cuts \\"The Moon and the Sky\\" and \\"Soldier of Love.\\"<br /><br />\\"Morning Bird,\\" features some of the moodiest, somber production work of the album, contrasting the hyper-drum programming that buttressed \\"Soldier of Love.\\" Here, Sade relies on twinkles of piano to support her restrained, yet distinctive vocals.  The strings (programmed most likely) contribute to the moodiness that is accentuated by this cut.  It is unconventional and spacing helps to contribute to its unconventional nature, but it is interesting and certainly worthwhile.  \\"Babyfather,\\" the first cut in a major key, is much more conventional, featuring a nice mid-tempo feel contrasting the darker \\"Morning Bird.\\" Lovely and tasteful acoustic guitars support Sade here, with a simple groove established by the drums.  The hook is incredibly simple, but contributes to the overall moody nature of the album as a whole stating \\"Your daddy knows you're a flame...\\"<br /><br />\\"Long Hard Road\\" finds more extension of moodiness featuring lovely guitars here.  Again, a string patch adds depth to the sound here, supporting Sade's telling, yet conservative vocal approach.  \\"Be That Easy\\" is slightly better, finding the band switching the groove to a six-feel and using a major key once more.  Here, the use of organ adds another dimension to the sound, changing it just enough to make \\"Be That Easy\\" a slightly more distinctive cut than some of the others.  \\"Bring Me Home\\" is quicker than \\"Be That Easy\\",  but is by no means revolutionary.  Again, Sade sounds polished though not necessary invigorated.<br /><br />\\"In Another Time\\" lifts the six-feel of \\"Be That Easy,\\" finding Sade exploring the upper extremes of her vocals.  Here, the addition of saxophone (played by band member Stuart Matthewman) differentiates the sound just enough.  The strings are as lovely as ever and always soothing.  \\"In Another Time\\" is the slightest bit sleepy, mostly due to its length, which clocks in at over five minutes.  \\"Skin\\" is a more enjoyable cut, finding the band changing thegroove and stripping down the production. \\"Skin\\" is effective because of it's \\"chilled\\" sense.  Finally, closing cut \\"The Safest Place\\" ends the album as moodily as it began, closing the album soundly.<br /><br />Essentially, 'Soldier of Love' is a solid album that should look forward to numerous Grammy nominations, if my predictions are correct.  While the album is not always necessarily the most `overt,' it is always great music to `chill to,' something Sade has always managed to pull off.  What 'Soldier of Love' does do is find a veteran artists (and band) still at their best, not necessarily their peak.  3 1/2 stars.the production. \\"Skin\\" is effective because of it's \\"chilled\\" sense.

B002ZG981E|5.0|Inception, Christopher Nolan's latest big-budget film, is largely about the idea of subconscious thought, control, and lack thereof. It involves a thief who specializes in industrial espionage and uses dreams to steal ideas and secrets from people. After a bad operation, he's given the choice to erase his past crimes in exchange for an impossible job- planting an idea instead of stealing one. To meet this end, Cobb assembles a team including his long-time partner Arthur, the architect Ariadne, a forger who shape-shifts, and a chemist who specializes in sedatives. Together, they delve into this dream-within-a-dream in order to carry out the inception of an idea. This description does not begin to describe the immense subtlety involved, the deep characterizations and motives, or the convoluted sense of reality presented. It truly awed me that a movie could be this good. The action is a sidenote to the incredible emotional stories and visual awesomeness that made this movie a must-see. Leonardo di Caprio is at his absolute best, as is Ellen Page. Michael Caine deserved more screen time (though it was always meant to be a bit part), the other team members were incredible, and the reality-bending dream segments were exercises in mind-blowing. I walked out of the theater speechless, astounded by the effect the film had on me, and in the short term, my perception of reality. Two selected scenes I enjoyed the most- the architect's training, where Ellen Page walked through the world changing it as she saw fit; and the sequence of jumps, awakening most of the team near the end of the film. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say all did not go as planned, but it was awesome anyway. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and found little to complain about. I'm seeing Academy nods in the future for this one, and that's the highest praise I can think of. I can't wait for the Blu-Ray version to be released.
B001XRLWPQ|1.0|I really don't understand why this show was released only in standard definition. The show was filmed in high definition (the HD format is available on Video on Demand).  Also, I don't understand why was used so high compression for the video the stream (3 hours and half per disc!!).  Of course I can't buy this DVD release. Hopefully, soon the Blu-ray version will be released.
B003YBNRHU|5.0|The Doobies are back...............great update of an old song and some solid new tunes. album of the year \\"world gone crazy\\".
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I've watched this movie several times and I enjoy it everytime as much as I did the first time I watched it. It's a fun, corny, love-conquers movie. It's one of my favorite Barrymore films.
B0045XH0WO|5.0|I love this series.  Last year had a few low spots, I thought, but this season is superb.  It's funny as ever, and the action is great.  Great looking girls, real he-men, and let us not forget:  the BUY MORE is back with its old crew.  Man this is Chuck with a capital CHUCK.
0439023513|5.0|I was absolutely addicted to the first two books and am fiercely protective of them. I have recommended them to my best friends and they are just as equally protective over them. I am so bitter about this book it is unbelievable. I can feel everybody's pain. Even \\"pain\\" is not the right word. Just dumbfounded bitterness. How dare Collin's ruin this series for us? How dare, after waiting, what, a year after the second book, she gives us this CRAP?   I have only given this book five stars out of five because it was either 5 or 1. I can not give it 2, 3, or 4 stars because there were NO redeeming qualities to the book. I have not given it 1 because i am too loyal to it. My fault, I guess.  The characters have totally been slaughtered. They are NOT the real people in the first two books.They would be better off DEAD than how they are now.   And do you know know another thing? Mockingjay does not count in the Hunger Games Series to me because there was NO Hunger Games in it.  Mrs Collins? We know war is terrible, horrific, chaotic, evil, unnecessary. But Mockingjay was just stupid and i cant believe how much you have let me down. YOUR WRITING IS TERRIBLE, SO IS YOUR CHARACTERIZATION, SO IS YOUR PLOT, SO IS YOUR BEGINNING, MIDDLE AND ENDING! AND DIALOGUE? WHAT DIALOGUE?  xx
081095415X|5.0|Brandt again demonstrates his excellent artistic skills with \\"A Shadow Falls.\\" His earlier book \\"On this Earth: Photographs from East Africa\\" is likewise an eye pleaser.
0385342047|4.0|I would give 3.5 stars if that were an option.    Sophie Kinsella's writing is as entertaining to read as ever, but it is a bit harder to laugh off Becky (Bloomwood) Brandon's irresponsible spending habits during a recession.  I know that part of the charm of the Shopaholic series is Becky's penchant to spend herself into trouble and the \\"wacky\\" ways she manages to escape disaster.      However, at this point in the series, she is married with a child, her parents are worried about managing financially, the current economic challenges are alluded to in the storyline (bank failures), and she still continues to spend without concern about her ability to pay.      I did enjoy the writing, and I did laugh out loud several times - there were definitely things to enjoy about the book.  However, it was difficult to like Becky and not be annoyed by her irresponsibility and immature behavior.  Her daughter, Minnie, comes off as irritating and spoiled.  Becky requires someone else to rescue her when she makes a mess of things rather than solving her own problems.  Much of the book focuses on a surprise party for her husband, which she insists must be more extravagant than she could come close to affording on her own.  The party itself is the big ending to the book, and the ridiculous extravagance of the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth.      I would love to read about Becky getting her act together a bit, finding a place to live without parental assistance, recognizing the impulsiveness she's passing on to her daughter and doing something about it, and basically growing up a bit more.      If you've read the earlier books in the Shopaholic series, then you will probably be able to enjoy \\"Mini Shopaholic\\" as well.  If, however, this is your first introduction to Becky Brandon, you might have trouble laughing off her impetuousness.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I LOVED this book.  It was intelligently written, and even though it was the first zombie novel I've read, I can't imagine how I can find another that will beat it.  While I was reading, I began to ask myself, \\"What would I do...\\" I am floored by how creatively written this was.  And lending to the believability of the story is that the author basis the plot on the foundation of world history's facts and events.  Weaving the factual with the fantastical made this story seem very believable.    Plot:  The basis of the book is that it is a collection of narrative accounts of people around the world who survived the zombie plague.  Initially, I thought this would detract from the flow of the story, however, the narratives added another level of fear, anxiety and desperation.      Characters:  There isn't a protagonist that you are following as the reader, but the voice of all the narratives serves to deliver the story line- which is how the planet survives in the midst of this zombie infestation, and what are the aftereffects.      I highly recommend this book, and I think it would be appreciated by readers who enjoy the subtle nuances an author uses to build suspense.
B001N44BVQ|4.0|At first I was not sure where the story was going, then I got plunged in a lot of intrigues and lies. Di Caprio and Crowe were superb! Would have liked for the story to continue!    If you like thrillers and packed action movies, this one is for you: you won't be disappointed.
B002RI9PHW|2.0|I was a big fan of one of the author's other books &#34;the book of tomorrow&#34; but I was so disappointed with &#34;where rainbows end&#34;!! I found it so frustrating to read!! I think the story is VERY hard to believe. I felt the urge to just shake Rosee a good deal of the time because I couldn't understand why she made all of those bad decisions. A lot of times it felt like she didn't WANT to be happy.   Another reason it felt frustrating was the amount of time that elapsed in the book. I felt like in real life years fly equally fast. Hard to explain.    It also bothered me A LOT how absurd a lot of things described in this book were. I know it's just fiction but it should be at least credible!    I still think Cecilia Ahern is a gifted writer but I just didn't enjoy this book.
B00005JKN9|4.0|I happened to be in Rome when \\"Gangs of New York\\" was being filmed. The set was unbelievable!    I just wish the editing didn't cut some scenes important to the story, which make it difficult to understand the  relationship between the characters.    Daniel Day-Lewis was incredible as Bill the butcher. Di Caprio and Cameron Diaz were perfectly cast and very convincing.  Martin Scorsese directed this movie and, as always, was just superb. The detail in each scene is worth seeing the movie!
0823015033|5.0|I plan to spend many winter days sculpting with this great book.  Techniques are simple to in-depth and very well illustrated.  I'm excited to add this title to my art library.
B003TML0VO|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever. It honors the classic rock singers, musicians and songwriters as never before.  Yes, it is a cover album, but it doesn't pretend to be anything else.  Santana gives honor to 12 classic rock guitar pieces but, at the same time, makes them his own. However, much of the album doesn't even sound like classic Santana--except for the latin-influenced percussion (that you only hear part of the time) and the sensational guitar playing.  I am a life-long rock fan (since the 50's!) and a big fan of Santana (since the 60's), and this album is the perfect marriage between the two.  The band members of Santana do a fantastic job with these pieces which are pretty much very \\"un-Santana-ish.\\" And they have chosen the perfect guest vocalist for each song.  I can already think of another dozen guitar classics to put on Guitar Heaven #2!      Don't let the negative reviews scare you off this album. I think they must have started writing their reviews based solely on the idea of such an album.  They obviously are anti-Clive Davis.  I can't believe that the negative reviewers every really listened to the album.  And, believe me, anyone who ever doubted Carlos Santana's guitar playing will walk away from this album with a totally different view.  As I've felt since the 60's, Carlos is one of the very best.  You should listen to a few of the songs--e.g., Whole Lotta Love, Riders on the Storm, Little Wing, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, etc.  You will want this album and will listen to it many, many times.  Each time I listen I appreciate the band, the vocalists and Carlos Santana more and more.

B000A6EXNO|5.0|It is an eye cup, it fits the camera, it is well made, well constructed, functional.. it's an eyecup.  Not much else you can say. It is the best Nikon DK-19 eye cup there is... its the only Nikon DK-19 eye cup there is.  There may be some other manufacturers models that fit and may offer some different functionality, but as far as the OEM product, this one works great.
0765326353|3.0|Yes, it was VERY long, 1000 pages. I think it might have been better if:    1. It was around 350 pages (I found myself reading one line of each paragraph and not missing much, if anything. It reminded me of the long boring parts of the middle WOT books - approximately numbers 6 thru 9. Or,put another way, it made me think of whole forests being sacrificed for very little gain).    2. It had some mildly likeable characters. (There were only two that were tolerable and the rest were ho-hum, very disposable and would not be missed. No Rands, Mats, Lans, Perrins etc etc, and the fem characters were about as exciting as Wot's Elayne).    3. The plot? Let's say it would have been better if contained within the aforesaid 350 pages.       All in all, I was disappointed. I won't bother to read the rest of the series.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Everything I could ever want (except for my own personal Rachel) is included in this box. Granted, my blu machine firmware updates have caused disc 3 to cease function, I was finally able to hear Harrison Ford's deadpan voice overacting. Also, given all the interviews, I now know much more about the book (\\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\") in which I very seriously don't intend to read. I don't five-star just anything; I heart this product.

B002UXRGLG|1.0|Commercially inventive!!  This is a commercial thinker's ingenuity!!  Add and mix recipe and call it  something else. An experiment that most of the times work.  Translating all I have just said: there are different scenes from Planet Earth and other documentaries, \\"spliced\\" it and presto - LIFE is made. I want my money back.  Have you seen BARAKA ?  There are scenes from that one too.  Learned my lesson.
B000VWE5OY|2.0|I bought this series having never seen it but it had Captain Jack and I loved him in Dr. Who. I was so disappointed. It's darker , less fun and very focused on exploring sex in all it's dimensions. I was just so hoping for the wonder and fun and morals of Doctor Who. Oh well I learned my lesson.
0439023513|3.0|The first two books in this series are absolutely fantastic reads.  Riveting, moving, surprising, and exciting.    This one just does not live up to those by any stretch of the imagination.  There are some cool ideas in here, but a lot of this book is very unbelievable.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but it felt like a chore to finish it.    I'll give it three stars because it does wrap up a few threads nicely, but this should have and could have been a five star page-turner.  Sadly, it just isn't.    I'm still on board with whatever she writes next, but I hope she steps her game back up.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|When it comes to purchasing a DVD you want, other store might or might not have it. check the sepcial editions to see if it got what it suppose to have. ex:BlADE II music videos,making of the film, etc.but Here At Amazon! is The Spot to find good movies at great prices believe i know.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|One of the best movies this decade for $8 was a steal, looks wonderful on bluray and for the price you can't get much better quality, it was cheaper than buying the dvd
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I've seen the originals..but this def scored up there with the rest. I saw it grudgingly @ the cinema..but fell in love w/ the main characters, even the bully---that kid CAN ACT. Anyways, this movie not only got a standing ovation from the ENTIRE theatre, but every scene had a clapping moment. The acting was superb and I think Will Smith and Jada did a great job with this production...so what if its their own kid?? HE CAN ACT! Get over it people... this movie is a winner in my book. The story had a touching side, with Dre and (jackie chans) character with how their frienship developed and grew into a male role model figure that Dre didn't have. Overall this  movie was GREAT.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I don't think I need to say much about this film...you've seen it. My only opinion is Katie should have stayed, she wasn't so bad, it wasn't like Maggie brought this film to Oscar heights.      So,... the blu-ray and dvd releases could have used some more features. I don't understand why the first film received such a generous bonus feature collection, and this film (larger might I add) just a few (pretty much) advertising materials for the film. The blu-ray came with those history channel specials, and there is one on the first disc, but...come on, we would like MORE!     I do have to say the video quality on the blu-ray, esp the IMAX scenes, are amazing! I believe this movie was made for blu-ray. I did see on the Amazon Japanese site some extra features not on the US release. Maybe if anyone can speak the language and type in it you can get it, bluray there should work in the US too.

I am usually a total wimp but I did really well and everyone who was there thinks I am some kind of super human or something. Seriously this book is amazing. I love it. I want everyone to read it. It is really better if you can take the classes as well as read the book but I didn't have any classes and I think things went really well. Not only does it teach amazing techniques but it calmed a lot of my fears about childbirth. It is just awesome. Just read it!!!

0887307280|5.0|The E-Myth Revisited is simply the best business book out there. This is the bible of all business books. a must have. Be prepared to throw all you other business books away after you read this one. This book is consistantly in the top 10 of all business books out there and there is a reason for that. Michael Gerber explains why most small businesses don't work. He creates a structure, a solid foundation for all business owners, leaving room for vision and innovation. Most business owners are technicians who owns a business and in the end just owns a job, a glorified employee who is self employed. Michael Gerber inks out a plan for all business: Your Primary Aim, Strategic Objective, Organizational Strategy, Management Strategy, People Strategy, Marketing Strategy, and Systems Strategy. There isn't a college in United States that teaches you how to start and operate a business but this book sure does.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|Simple fact:  Double Fantasy is a classic.  Lennon's last fully realized LP showcased a man moving comfortably into middle age, growing up without growing completely content.  The songs are sharp, witty, and often moving.  The original mixes included here are a great sonic trip down memory lane.    Now onto the \\"Stripped Down\\" version included here.  To these ears, it improves on the original mixes in every way.  The echo is gone from the vocals, superfluous background vocals have been removed, and nearly every instrument is heard in greater relief and clarity than it was on the original release.  Tony Levin's stellar bass work, in particular, on these tracks stands out as one of the main drivers of these tunes.    \\"Just Like Starting Over\\" benefits from this arrangement, adding warmth and depth while removing the surface gloss.  \\"Cleanup Time\\" and \\"I'm Losing You\\" get the most from removing the echo, and the other tracks are similarly well served.  Sure to be overlooked here is what the new mixes have done to Yoko's contributions--they're all richer in the new context than before.  Yoko's music has always been about intimacy, and simplifying the mixes and putting her vocals up front reveals the passion she brought to the project.  In fact, rather than serve as the distraction from John most people thought they were 30 years ago, they instead provide a strong counterpoint to his songs, and show that Yoko is an accomplished artist in her own right.  To be sure, she's not on John's level, but her contributions no longer grate as they once did.    Overall, this new disc is nothing short of a revelation, and a stronger album for it.  Highly, highly recommended.
0307454541|3.0|I'd looked forward to reading this series for some time seeing how it was at the top of the best seller lists and still is on the top 10.  However, I found it to be an ordinary mystery novel written in a way that was at some times, very difficult to follow.  The beginning was soooo slow going, I about gave up.  About a quarter of the way through, though, it got more interesting.  I was hooked there for awhile, but was completely disgusted by the fact that Salander and Blomkvist started sleeping together.  I thought that it should have been a more father/daughter type of relationship.  And after the \\"killer\\" was found, the story went on and on and on.  It could have been wrapped up much quicker than it was.  I have next book in the series as well, and am hesistant to start reading it.  Overall, good mystery novel, but not great!
B001VZY4MS|5.0|By 1968 Neil had already made a name for himself particularly in the folk rock genre.  This self titled solo debut has two instrumental tracks, the country sounding The Emperor Of Wyoming and the classical sonding String Quartet From Whiskey Boot Hill, the latter being hardly what many would have expected. However they both work very well in the context of this album.  The remainder are vocal tracks incompassing folk, country and rock.  There's Dylan like word play in some songs, while others are slow ballards.  The remastering is of the highest standard and while, in my mind, After The Goldrush and Harvest tower above all his other work, this really is a top class starter.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This comedy grew on me. The characters are very original. The comedy comes very natural. I am love with this season actually. I'm still a little ambivalent about the second season. However, the first season is a wonderful piece of new writing. It's filled with optimism and sentiment. And that's hard to find nowadays in sitcoms.

Personally I'm in love with 90's rock, but even if you dont start and end with it like I do, this album is still an absolute must own.  From the opening drum rolls and building guitars of \\"Cherub Rock\\", to the stunning beauty of the closing \\"Luna\\", this album transports you into a perfect melodic world.  Maybe you're one of the many people that find Corgan's voice whiny and annoying, but even still \\"Siamese Dream\\" remains something to behold.  Each song has its own different personality, yet the entire cd flows together brilliantly with a totally unique sound.      When it comes to the music itself, this cd is massive.  For example, Corgan has stated that \\"Soma\\" has at least 40 overdubbed guitar parts.  This song in particular captures the overall nature of this album.  It starts out quiet and slow, but totally engrosses your senses.  Eventually it explodes in the second half with loud and catchy chord progressions and one of the many totally unique solos you can find peppered throughout the album.  In the end the driving guitars cease and return to their original quiet beauty.      The highlights of this hour plus are too many to mention.  The most famous tunes, \\"Cherub Rock, \\"Today\\", and \\"Disarm\\", are all great and deserving of their fame, but only the tip of the iceberg. \\"Quiet\\" is loud and aggressive. \\"Hummer\\" is more of a mid tempo rocker with an extended outtro of layered guitars that seem to surround you.  \\"Geek USA\\" is another hard one, slowing a little under half way through, and then coming back at about 2:30 into one of my favorite 30 or so seconds of the ride, always making my head bob back and forth.  And how can anyone not appreciate the power drumming of Jimmy Chamberlain, especially present here.  In every song he seems to perfectly accompany the rest of the music, with incredible and unique fills almost everywhere.      To continue with my favorites, \\"Mayonaise\\" is another mid tempo song that so many people seem to pick as their top choice, and for good reason.  Lyrically it's sincere and heartfelt, much like the rest.  \\"Sweet Sweet\\" is yet another little beauty that I've always seen as a sort of intro into the soothing \\"Luna\\".  And saving to mention last is my personal favorite, which sometimes seems overlooked: \\"Rocket\\".  I've never been able to put my finger on what it is that captures me, but I can never stop listening to this song until its over.  The bassline rides throughout, underneath the many various guitar parts which seem to hit me perfectly.  Towards the end the guitars all converge into absolute bliss, finally building and crashing to an end.      My praise for this album is never ending, and if for some strange reason you've never heard it, you've been missing out on some of the best music you can imagine.  Please give it a listen, your ears will thank you.
0689878451|5.0|I'm a 16 year old boy who wears a lot of black and listens to death metal......    and this is one of my favorite books. I oppose bigotry of all types, but since two of my relatives are gay, this is a topic that I have a firm stance in. I don't understand why the idea of two beings of the same gender in a relationship upsets people. I understand there's a religious opposition to this, but most of the homophobes I come across just say that it's \\"wrong\\" without giving any actual reason. It perplexes and depresses me.    As for the book itself, it's f'ing adorable. If you like penguins, that's enough of a reason to buy this.     And for the parents claiming that this book is harmful to children, I guarantee you that this book, along with any other inanimate object, will do a far better job of raising your kids than you ever could. Keep your backwards morals to yourselves and give your kids a chance to form their own opinions. Hypocrites.
B001992NW4|5.0|I love The Exorcist - always have.  I have purchased all the versions along the way - vhs, dvd, extended version.  But now that most films I purchase are blu rays I was thrilled at the release of The Exorcist on blu ray.  There is always a simple first question to be asked when an older film is released on blu ray.  Was it a quick hatchet job merely to make more money off the film or was it a lovingly done restoration taking advantage of the new technology of blu ray.  I can gladly 1000% say that this one is handled with loving care.  The film looks amazing.  Color and the black/white ration is amazing.  Close ups throughout will have you awestruck.  It honestly is like viewing the film for the first time.  And they so impressively left the grainy parts intact.  This is a film over 30 years old and they could have easily erased all signs of age.  But some of the graininess in dark or night footage is necessary to the telling of the story and they left it as it should be.  Audio is superb and your home theater system will have a field day with the dramatic audio here.  Dialogue is also pefectly presented and not off from the musical backdrop or extrememe sound of the violent scenes.<br /><br />Now to the effects.  Remember that this film is decades old and special effects have grown leaps and bounds.  Here we get all of the scenes with Reagan totally cleaned up and let me tell you none of the frightening aspect is gone.  The only thing I noticed was how the blood was obviously red paint.  Otherwise this film is in no way dated and the blu ray version in fact raises it to another level.  I was amazed at how my perceptioon of the film changed due to this amazing version.  I think it is a huge gift that both the original theatrical version and the later extended director's cut are presented here in blu ray glory.  I prefer the theatrical version so that is the version I am speaking of.  I think that The Exorcist often gets misconstrued being described as a pure horror film.  It is so much more than this.  It is true that film makers have been trying to duplicate the effect of this film ever since.  From Scream, Halloween and Friday the 13 directors are trying to reach the same effect.  But by doing this they are missing the whole point.<br /><br />Viewing the film this time was the first time I saw how obviously it is a film of good versus evil and each viewer will have a different perception.  The Catholic Church plays a huge part and obviously represents the good and it works so well.  The viewer must see the Church as a religious presence and the nurturing it represented before all the tragic issues that would later arise within the church.  The priests here are good men, some troubled but all wanting to do their best.  Regan is perfectly displayed as an innocent without rubbing it in the viewers face.  From the beginning scene it is obvious that evil is being shown and as it wraps itself inside Regan it is terrifying.  The special effects still work for they are used to add to the story and meaning of the film.  They are not meant to be gratuituous.  In a world with such trouble this films clearly shows that there is good and evil.  The viewer is left with much to think about after viewing this superb blu ray version.<br /><br />I know people have double and triple dipped on The Exorcist but I cannot praise the blu ray release highly enough.  And it is handsomely presented in a hardback booklet with 38 pages of history on the film inside.  And there are special effects galore.  There is a new 3 part documentary on the film's production and legacy plus a feature length 1998 documentary on the making of the film with so much more.  The Exorcist is indeed a horror film but it is so much more.  It is one of the best movies made of any genre and deserves to be in any film collectors library.  And this blu ray version does immense justice to a classic.  Highly recommended.is so much more than this.

B00000K3D4|5.0|This dvd was in great condition although it was labeled as good condition. The delivery was very fast we recieved it in about 2-3 days. It was great that we recieved this dvd on a rainy day which made watching it even better. I remembered this movie as a child which was one of my favorites because it's a kind of Alice in wonderland fantasy movie with creatures and puppets and David Bowie's music just makes it more awesome and mysterious.I was able to share this movie with my children and enjoy it all over again but this time on dvd!! Lol. Also it is a perfect movie for the kiddies now that Halloween is close by. I would definitly order from this seller again. -Happy Customer :)
044654759X|4.0|The book was good a little predicitable but still good.  Couldn't put it down once i started reading.  I could see this turning into a movie.
B002XTBE8I|5.0|Not a bad album but also not his greatest but it is worth buying. The \\"refill\\" portion is good so you can have more songs.
B0019N8P2W|3.0|Yes, it's Daria as we remember her.  Yet, it is like cake without the icing without the music.  It amazes me that the music industry seems to want to exterminate itself and blame others for its failure.  This is a huge missed opportunity to sell many songs or a equally monumental soundtrack.  Yet, people will not buy what they cannot hear. It could have been a revival for many 90s artists to a new generation.  I suppose in the name of copyright, the powers that be want to keep the songs to themselves.  Yes, I am glad it has been released, but ironically it portrays what a Sick Sad World we have become.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I bought this item used and when I received it, I thought it was new. Excellent!
B001B7CNXI|2.0|I won't comment on the film itself as there are plenty of very detailed reviews about the storylines, characters, settings, etc. here at Amazon.    However the HD mastering of the Blu-Ray version needs to be mentioned, and not positively.    Michael Mann shot much of this feature using the Viper HD video camera, particularly all of the night shots. Those shots don't stand up well on this disc in contrast to many of the day shots, including the fantastic aerial sequences. The night shots have lots of visible picture noise, as well as a lack of detail which spoils the HD experience noticeably. Maybe this is the nature of the Viper footage, maybe this was a rush job for the studio to put content into the (new) format pipeline to make more money without paying attention to the quality of the content. Regardless, unless you can pick this title up deeply discounted from list price, stick with the standard-def DVD until somebody takes some time to release this title on Blu-Ray properly. For such a gifted visualist as Michael Mann, this version of Miami Vice is not a good representation of what he is capable of. If you want to impress, try screening Public Enemies instead, at least until the studio fixes this one.
0425166805|5.0|Really cool book! It makes you think. I heard about this author while watching a program on the Discovery channel(I think) about aliens and their possible role in ancient civilizations. The book is an easy read and very interesting...it makes you think. If you're interested in history and aliens it's definitely worth checking out.
0061876747|5.0|Engrossing read. Elegant, stylish writing. A journey through a London little known to many of us, into the belly of the underworld and of the working poor. Also, a journey down the Thames where we are treated to a close look at the tides, the flotsam and jetsam, the very waters - their color and substance - that lend credence to the Thames still being the hub of London life.<br /><br />Importantly, what drives the story is the transformation of genteel academic Adam Kindred who, with hopes of an interview for a top job, inadvertently becomes a murder suspect after being embroiled in the assassination of a stranger. From posh to lower class, he turns into a homeless in hiding at the edge of the Thames, a hobo wandering and rediscovering the city, before growing in street smarts, assuming another identity, and outwitting an assassin. During his journey, Adam, in essence, reinvents himself and builds a new, more fulfilling life.
0553805371|4.0|I've enjoyed the book but even in layman's terms this book is over my head much of the time. I'm a big fan of Stephen Hawking but have never read any of his books, which lead me to buy his newest offering, \\"The Grand Design.\\" None-the-less, it's still a good read and very enjoyable. He injects humor whenever he can.
030726999X|5.0|I love this series.  It just gets better as you move on to the next book.  Aside from suspense and drama that centers around Lisbeth Salander, I like learning certain things about Sweden (government/police) and it makes me wonder how my own government run behind the scenes.  Definitely a good read!  Highly recommended especially if you will be stuck on a long flight.  :)
B000PC0U1W|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time...one I can watch over and over again and blu-ray makes it that much better...such a great film and great actors. Anybody who loves action movies and movies with twists that make you go wow!...this is the movie for you.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|Excellent quality video and sound. And Anne Francis looks WOW. This film has so many great stars in it and is so well done. Leslie Nielsen, Walter Pidegon, Earl Hollman, Richard Anderson, Jack Kelly and Anne Francis. 50's sci-fi with a quality cast and respectable special effects even by today's standards.
B003EYVXT6|4.0|From Vincenzo Natali, the director of the original Cube, Splice is a curious offspring of horror and science gone wrong.  Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley star as two brilliant scientists whose experimentation with cross-breeding various brands of DNA result the creation of \\"Dren\\", whose rapid growth results in a devilishly and strangely seductive form (played by Delphine Chaneac).  For most of its running time, Splice is a thought provoking horror/thriller that delivers some genuine shocks and surprises, and is made all the better thanks to the performances of Brody and Polley.  Even Chaneac, though she never utters a word, makes what could be close to being a star-making turn as the monsterously sexy Dren.  Though it turns into a by-the-numbers chase towards the conclusion of the film, Splice is nevertheless entertaining and intelligent, and is more than worth your time.
B001JAFYFG|4.0|The film translates well to Blu-Ray and the story line and production quality is quite good for a 70's movie. When my movie guru pointed out to me the major flaw in the film was that for a society that was made up of survivors of Washington DC there are no African Americans. I looks and she is right. (if you don't count the guy in the robot suit (Roscoe Lee Brown). But it is a well done film.
B003L1ZWG2|3.0|Frozen is an interesting real-world horror tale from writer/director Adam Green (Hatchet, Spiral), in which a trio of college students (Kevin Zegers, Shawn Ashmore, Emma Bell) find themselves trapped on a ski lift.  Facing the peril of either freezing to death or risking deadly injury by dropping down to the ground below, Frozen can basically be described as being more similar to Open Water than anything else.  That aside, that's not saying that there isn't anything to admire here.  The three stars of the film are quite good, and Green manages to inject enough solid dialogue into the script to keep you interested in the characters and the goings on, but the pacing of the film is what really ends up bogging it down.  Not to mention that by the time a voracious pack of wolves make their presence known, the authenticity of the film's logic just gets thrown out the window.  Still, Frozen is worthwhile terror for what it's worth, and you could always do much worse than this.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Iron Man (2008) is a stylish and super-entertaining film about a super smart engineering genius and billionaire with a troubled past that builds a suit of iron that gives him super-human strength and ability to fly around the earth at super speeds. He created it as body armor protection to defeat international terrorists, criminals and his evil enemies. The fight scene where Robert Downey junior as ironman  fights Jeff bridges in the Iron monger suit on the streets of los Angeles is spectacular and exciting.
B003FLWHA2|5.0|I bought this product for the younger grandchild but found that the older one also enjoyed it.
B001DHXT20|4.0|The Incredible Hulk(2008)is more intense and darker than it`s predecessor The Hulk(2003).Dr. Bruce banner (Edward Norton)is desperately trying to find a cure to stop transforming into the incredible hulk and is trapped in a warehouse factory in brazil, south America and has to fight the army who is trying to capture him and some bullies that want to beat him up. He changes into the incredible hulk and growls in an angry voice \\"leave me alone\\". Bullets bounce off his back and fall on the ground like pellets. There is a deleted scene in the beginning of the movie when Bruce banner is in Alaska trying to commit suicide and he puts a gun in his mouth and his eyes turn green and he changes into the incredible Hulk and spits the bullet out and the Hulk saves Dr. Bruce banner and crushes the gun and smashes a giant glacier that is so cool and amazing. Compared to the 15ft.tall Hulk in Hulk(2003) the 9ft.tall incredible Hulk is a mini-Hulk. The Hulk(2003) is a beast that gets bigger and stronger when he gets angry. A Russian soldier named Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth)gets injected with the armies super soldier serum and Bruce banner`s gamma radiated blood and mutates into an evil looking creature named the abomination that rivals the incredible hulk in size and strength. Dr. Bruce banner is an ordinary man who is a brilliant scientist that has the ability to change into the incredible hulk when his life is in danger. The Super-genius Dr. Samuel Sterns also known as the Leader(Tim Blake nelson) wants to be a mental and spiritual god. Emil Blonsky wants to be a physical god. The incredible Hulk is about a man doomed by his nature and the decisions he makes and his powerful alter ego that saves him and is his best friend.

B0021L8V1Q|5.0|While I would give 4 stars to the theatrical release of this picture, the blu-ray package deserves the best rating.  It's packed with necessary features, and it looks absolutely fantastic.  This purchase rekindled my love for blu-ray, and I'm impressed with Paramount and Marvel's efforts.  In a world filled with useless special features, Iron Man 2 gives us what we really want, although I still want more.<br /><br />The film has its problems, but its definately solid.  Some of the logic is absent, the plotwork thin, but the actors sell it and its nearly nonstop fun.  It dips a little bit in the middle, but all of its fanboy treats made me fall in love with the film.  I praise this film for squeezing great bits out from the Marvel universe, while still holding back a lot of big guns.  The film gave me a fun Iron Man vs. Villain story, while still introducing me to a few new cherished Marvel characters.  The biggest impact from Iron Man 2 is the undeniable tension it gives in me stemming from my desire to travel through time to see Thor, Captain America, and Avengers.  Iron Man 2 is a great film on its own, but what I love about it most, is that it promises a great future.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, the blu-ray is worth your money.  Thankfully only one commentary exists (I'm tired of seeing the movie 5 times to learn all the secrets).  And its backed up by blocky behind-the-scenes featurettes.  I praised the second transformers movie, however flawed it was, for having a great blu-ray release.  Paramount knows how to give people what they want in their purchase.  Universal needs to abandon the U-control and get on board with what Paramount and Sony are providing.<br /><br />*******Easter Egg*****<br />Watch the end of \\"Building a Legacy\\" on disc 2.  You will be awarded, after the credits, with a clip of Thor filming.  It contains an interview with the comic writing genius Michael J. Straczynski, and his humbled love for the film.  I literally raised my legs and started kicking like a little girl.<br /><br />Good film, great blu-ray.  The film itself gave me all that I wanted, however sloppy it may have delivered it, and the blu-ray just nailed it.  The only thing I request in the next installment is that they give more logical reasoning for the plot.  The element creation plot, was a little hard to swallow for a chem major, and I don't think they'll be able to sell it with jokes next time.  However, theres so much to love about this film that I can't help ignoring its problems.e girl.    Good film, great blu-ray.

B003EYVXSW|1.0|This film was extremely bad if just for the fact it blapheme's The Lord's name more times than I could count. But then, it seems to fit with a movie that relates so well to such over-welming evil and going even so far as displaying bestiality in discusting detail. Natually, being that the average mind is now brain-washed to think of all this as being the norm, I disagree. Although I'm a Christian man, I have always been a fan of horror movies as long as there done with at least a little good sence or taste. This discusting film left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm glad I only rented it instead of buying it. I give it one star \\"only\\" for the effects. On the other hand, I'd throw-up before seeing this abomination one more time. Shame on everyone responsible in making this thing. \\"UGH\\"!

1615230823|4.0|For those who like to occasionally jump into the \\"non-fiction\\" pool, put on your swim goggles, open your mind, grab some salt (you'll need a few grains), and step into this very interesting sea of reasons why so few people (\\"outliers\\") rise to the top.  Remembering that scientific<br />\\"studies\\" are based on relative facts and numbers, you will discover the author's friendly ideas of how birthdates, historical touchpoints, parents, practice time, etc. seem to determine a person's chance for success.  As for me, I seem to have missed the magic birthdate, era, upbringing; and I haven't practiced enough-- is it too late for me?  No matter; I enjoyed this book, and I don't believe everything I read!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I've never really known too much about racing but I'm an avid pet lover, and that's what drew me to this book: a dog tells the story!! I have learned so much from this fantastic novel, it truly should be passed on for others to read. Loved every bit of it!
1593081154|4.0|\\"Frankenstein\\" is a classic of Gothic literature that has boasted several spin-off books and movies.  This particular edition rounds out at about 200 pages, and it was a quick read for me.  It's not terribly fast-paced by today's standards, but it is engaging.  The title character, Victor Frankenstein, grows up with an affinity for science and is determined to make his mark on humanity.  He scavenges for human  body parts until he is able to create, and bring to life, a new creation.  As soon his creation comes to life, however, Victor is horrified by what he refers to as \\"the monster.\\"<br /><br />The novel is a frame story, and Victor's tale is conveyed  by a ship's captain who finds him wandering in the North.  The story of the monster is told mostly from Victor Frankenstein's point of view, but in some longer parts the monster narrates his experiences to Victor.  For me, the monster's story was the most riveting part of the novel--I found Victor's character a bit annoying at times.  The novel as a whole emphasizes the potential dangers of science, but it also brings to light themes of the dire consequences when the \\"created\\" is neglected or, worse, treated ill.  The monster's character starts out as quite a sympathetic one, until he meets with the horror and revulsion of human beings he encounters.  This raises issues about the consequences of intolerance that are relevant today; the enduring themes of the novel help to make it a classic.<br /><br />While those who prefer a fast-paced plot may be a bit bored with this, fans of earlier Gothic literature will enjoy the ride.  This edition has useful end notes as well as a helpful scholarly introduction (best read after the novel is finished due to spoilers) and biographical information about the author.  Additional commentary and questions for discussion are also provided.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|I grew up with the \\"BEATLES\\" & I  remember like it was yesterday watching them on the \\"ED SULIVAN SHOW\\" WITH my family. We were glued to the TV  every sunday that they were on.

0061339202|4.0|dr. unpronouceable almost lost me with his ignorance and prejudice when he said, \\"Traditionally, the problem of exsitence has been most directly confronted through religion, and an increasing number of the disillusioned are turning back to it, choosing either one of the standard creeds or a more esoteric Eastern variety.\\"    if he had ever cared to read beyond and before kierkegaard, nietzsche or even plato and socrates, let his worshipping mind wonder beyond the abrahamic personality cults of moses, jesus and mohammed, and let himself hop on a flight beyond the arabian sea, he would have known that in the orient (and that includes the forgotten fount of india) it is not religions governed by dictats that rule the roost, but ways of life backed by philosohpies. thus hinduism, which is a nomenclature of the west, is actually indian philosophy, which has various strains but some very very profound and robust philosophical and some spiritual core.    so no wonder that throughout the entire first chapter, where he makes some really compelling points, i kept on asking myself \\"what is the new thing has this guy says he has discovered?\\" because all what he propounds and more, are already in the texts of indian philosophy, wrongly called by the western academic as hindu or buddhist scriptures.    having said that, what dr. m_______ actually has done is nothing but the age old practice of quest for happiness, and having seen some light, put it out for the world to see. kudos to you dr. m____! i salute you for your journey because as you found out, it's only the journey that matters, not the end.     now, i hope you realise that because you made the journey within the modern setting of an academic portal, it does not go on to become the only definitive and therefore superior one to the ones made before. if your \\"flow\\" is followed by millions for next thousand years and is cluttered with anthropological debris and cultural trash, you will also be worshiped as a prophet and \\"flow\\" will go on to become another religion to be duly debunked by others at a later date.    you get the drift, i presume.    but a book surely worth a read and ponder as it gives us a contemporary tool for the quintessential quest.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|With Band of Joy, Robert Plant reinforces his reputation as the greatest vioce of his generation and the most innovative of his Led Zeppelin cadres.    In short, it is a brilliant album featuring exquisite vocals and instrumentation.  The production is first class.    JPJ has excelled with Them Crooked Vultures.  JPJ and RAP have well and truly thrown down the gauntlet to Mr James Patrick Page. C'mon Jimmy, you can match 'em!
B000063JZQ|4.0|By removing parts of many scenes, the overall result was more concise and less confusing for those not already familiar with the play or the Elizabethan dialog.  As far as I could discern, no dialog was changed.  This abridgement also made it possible to depict events which are only reported to the viewer in the full play.  For example, the execution of Cawdor was witnessed by King Duncan rather than just reported to him.  And MacDuff's final fight with MacBeth was depicted quite realistically with regard to medieval weapons and amour rather than taking place off-stage with MacDuff reappearing with MacBeth`s head..    .  Set in a starkly bleak landscape with dreary weather along with highly accurate and minutely detailed depictions of everyday life in the castles, the the film set an ethereal and even fantastical atmosphere.  .  Many of the soliloquys were done by voice-over rather than directly spoken.  This invited the listener into the mind of the character, and was more realistic when in the presence of others since this removed the need for a hard-to-hear mumbling sotto voce.  .  The director put in some additional plot twists which were latent in the original, and indeed I wonder if Shakespeare did himself or expected other producers to so tamper with his script..  These were accomplished without altering the basic story and dialog.  I describe two of these below but there might have been others that I missed.    Donalbain, the younger son of King Duncan and disinherited brother of Malcolm, has no function in the play except that his conversation with Malcolm after the murder of Duncan explains their flight from Scotland.  (But this explanation could have been done just as well with a soliloquy by Malcolm.)  Donalbain tries to suppress an angry snarl when his father announces that Malcolm gets everything.  Malcolm's speech terminating the play by proclaiming the restoration of a \\"kinder gentler\\" Scotland under his rule is omitted.  Instead, the final scene ofthe film is a lone rider in the rain dismounting and carrying something (perhaps an offering) to the place where the witches can be found.  He is recognized only by his slight limp as Donalbain.  This of course sets up for a sequel, which would hopefully resolve the as-yet unfulfilled prediction that Banquo's line will be kings, for which his son Fleance is conveniently available.  There is a great opportunity for Donalbain to become a sort of Scottish Richard III.   Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern are Dead is one such exploration of Shakespearean loose ends; are there any others?    Another interesting touch accomplished without change in dialog is the transformation of Ross.  At face value in the play, he is a loyal and honest servant of the new king MacBeth until he can no longer stomach the tyranny, slaughter, and corruption, then defects as a patriot to join other disaffected Scottish lords under Malcolm in England.  In this film, he becomes a self-seeking and willing accomplice of MacBeth.  Ross is the mysterious and unexpected third murderer of Banquo.  [III:3]  (It almost seems that this inclusion is some sort of \\"gateway\\" put in by Shakespeare for just such a character.)  A nice touch learned later by organized crime is that the hired murderers are themselves killed by being thrown into an oubliette in MacBeth's castle.  New murderers are then hired for the MacDuff purge.  .  Ross' unexplained visit to and comforting of the wife of MacDuff is merely a ruse to throw her off guard and to get the postern to open the castle gates for the murderers. [IV:2]  (This is analagous to a well-planned Stalin era arrest in which a collaborator appearing to be friend visits the victim for a few hours prior to the arrival of the NKVD in order to prevent flight, suicide, and destruction of evidence.)  The playwrite sets this up when Ross seems suspiciously in a hurry to depart MacDuff's wife before the murders arrive:    I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,    It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:    I take my leave at once.  Ross only defects when Macbeth awards his ill-gotten estate of Cawdor to another lieutenant, leaving Ross unrewarded for all the evil deeds he has done on behalf of Macbeth.  Ross is welcomed as a partiot by Malcolm and hypocritically reports the death of MacDuff's family.  The tale of his treachery dies with Macbeth.
1423101472|5.0|I got my book today and i was so impressed it was listed as being used in good condition. When i opened the box it looked like a brand new book i love it thanks for the wonderful book at a wonderful price !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003QP4NPE|5.0|This was a great read. Kept me up late on my iPad, literally having to force my self to turn it off and sleep. The writing style is very efficient. Wasn't too wordy or full of wasteful descriptions. Important for me as I get bored easily. The book was a blast! After taking a break with another book, I am now going to purchase Liberty. Can't wait to see what direction the Daemon takes me.
1934030198|5.0|i never like the word \\"bible\\" in a book title...kinda offensive to me...but i have to say, if there is a bible for triathletes, this would be it.  Very complete as to how your body functions ... written for those who want to understand, not just grab a training plan. This may have more info than most people want, but the more you know, the more successful you can be in setting up your plan. However, no actual training plans are laid out, so i recommend Bernhardt's book (training plans for multisport athletes) along with this for a complete guide to your planning.
B002TQKHIS|5.0|Espectacular es la palabra para describir este producto lo tiene todo imagen en alta definicion gran sonido grandes canciones que mas se puede pedir¡  La actuacion en la azotea en el teatro ED Sullivan es super emocionante lo recomiendo a todos los fans del gran Paul
B003L77GHE|5.0|I started watching this the first season and loved it. My grand daughter wasn't interested until I let her borrow my complete 1st season> now she is hooked and says she likes it just as much as the Twilight series. Even wants to read the books. She is waiting for the 2nd season to come out on DVD because she didn't watch the first 2 episodes but won't watch it now until she can see them all. I am buying her the set so I can keep mine. This is the best and if you like vampires you will love this. I couldn't get into watching True Blood cause the characters were not how I thought they would be and the character Sookie tries to hard with the southern accent and she just doesn't fit my idea as the character.
B0000D9R2I|5.0|Just to get it off my chest, it peeves me how often people say something like, \\"not technically proficient\\", \\"amateurish\\" (as even the description of the item above stated!). Even fans are beginning to sound apologetic when they discuss Venom. Lose that rubbish. There's no need if you are in the know. We are talking Venom! The music blows you away! Who even has the head space to sit and analyze the roaring thunder and lightning storm? You just get into it. Actually, it gets into you. I think maybe people must be coming to this music late or something because I can't imagine it coming from someone who was around in the beginning. All we felt was the raw, boundary breaking, electric excitement. Venom was hugely influential to practically every band that formed the first 2 waves of thrash/black metal. So please, respect them, man.<br /><br />Now to the album: Get it. It is essential music. If you are looking at this review, I imagine you are a metalhead. A metalhead without Welcome to Hell is like a cowboy without his hat. This album has withstood the eroding forces of time and it hasn't lost its effect. It pumps and drives wicked good. I have a hard time walking down the street listening to my CD version of it without acting like a fool, at least in other people's eyes. It makes you rock. Hard. The lyrics are huge fun. The audacity to come out with that in the 80s just makes me laugh with morbid pleasure. Actually, they are still pretty iconoclastic. Equivalent lyrices today are found only in Death Metal today but you really can't understand them without a lyric sheet. The delivery here is clear as a bell.<br /><br />Now for a contentious point, but a necessary one. The vinyl version is the best one if you want to hear it as good as it can possibly be. I have it on both CD and DVD, so I can carry the music in my player. Perhaps the critics never heard it on vinyl, which is why they are stuck on this technique point. Analog creates a soundstage that makes the music bounce, so it sounds more dynamic. Vinyl can capture that, while CDs or Mp3s cannot. That's not the only difference but its enough for this purpose. This point is important with Venom because they are a minimalist band. Now, for many, you have to retrain your ears to be able to get all the nuance of the music because ears have gotten lazy since the digital revolution, especially nonmusicians who listen to compressed files alot. Once you do, you will hear the difference. (Actually, if you go to You Tube and search for Carnivore, God is Dead, you will find various uploads from digital media but there's one guy who uploaded it from vinyl. You can see him spinning it. Listen to that and compare it to the others. The difference is audible and that is with the warts of having to transfer it to digital and upload it to 'not the best sounding' You Tube. The Carnivore song is also more minimalist than bombastic too.) (Please don't bother bashing me because of this paragraph. I mention it only because the album is available as a vinyl record. I'm not interested in the old argument, which I've heard a million times. All I care about is keeping my ears happy and engorged on great sound.)<br /><br />Now stop reading, click buy now, and turn it up when it arrives. Hell is waiting, and so are Abaddon, Mantas, and Cronos!nds more dynamic. Vinyl can capture that, while CDs or Mp3s cannot. That's not the only difference but its enough for this purpose.

B003XQ9BXU|1.0|This movie is horrible.  What a dumb story.  I couldn't even watch it to the end as it was so stupid.  Russel Crowe takes himself way too serious.  SAVE YOURSELF!!  ANY VERSION OF THIS MOVIE IS BETTER THAN THIS ONE, EVEN THE DISNEY CARTOON.  YUCK!!!!!!!
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|got it locally for less, as for the movie, its ok but not as good as the first.  too much quick over lap in the dialogue to understand some of the voices.  picture quality is great on my 65\\" tv, the sound level (D range) from soft to loud is quite high and needed to have receiver compress it some to not disturb the neighbors.
B003UYV08E|4.0|Robert Downey, Jr. is back as Tony Stark. Once again, Downey proves he is the best man to fill the Stark shoes as he makes a dramatic drop onto the stage and is surrounded by dancing women wearing lights in provocative places. You are never sure if he is the CEO of a major weapons manufacturer or a member of the Rat Pack. It seems he is the only cast member who stayed in character during the two-year vacation from part one. Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts comes across as jealous and angry through most of the film and LTC James \\"Rhodey\\" Rhodes is played by a new actor, Don Cheadle. We see a darker side to Tony as he drinks more, parties more, and seems to care for Pepper less. It is inferred that he is distancing himself because he is slowly dying. Unfortunately, there is never a long enough break from the action for a proper scene to explain it all. Mickey Rourke, hot off of his rave reviews from The Wrestler, dons a Russian accent to play Ivan Vanko, the new super-baddie in town. Vanko is just a puppet for corporate baddie, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), to hide behind. Neither Rourke nor Rockwell live up to their previous acting hype and combined, do not compare to the strong screen presence Jeff Bridges gave us in part one. A few surprises to the film are Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Scarlett Johansson, the sexiest Black Widow to ever grace the screen. The film is reduced to being mostly an action flick with a few moments of Downey to wake us up.

0553805371|1.0|Conceptually incoherent.  An infinite number of universes, one for each possible quantum state, eliminates the basis for rationality, law, and science itself.  But Hawking writes the book as if the ideas he advances don't apply to himself.    The interpretation of quantum physics advanced allows for the possibility the book being attributed to Hawking spontaneously came into existence.  After all, if the universe spontaneously came into existence  out of nothing, why not the much simpler (i.e., higher probability) book attributed to Stephen Hawking?      Therefore, Stephen Hawking is an unnecessary hypothesis.  We just happen to live in one of the universes where his book spontaneously came into existence with the appearance he wrote it and Hawking -- to the extent we can be sure he exists (which is not at all under the ideas he advances) -- is simply an opportunistic bystander. For shame.    You see where this leads.  Probability becomes meaningless within a given universe. No court case can stand. No matter how implausible the story and evidence, we may in fact live in one of the near-infinite number of universes where the gun fired itself, the glove changed sizes to fit, a mysterious stranger suddenly popped into existence, did the deed, then disappeared.  All these things and more are normal in the multiverse concept.    Similarly, Hawking's story means the regularity of the natural world explored by science is also a chimera; we happen to live in a universe that gives the appearance of regularity as a low-probability outcome over all universes. Science, the search for causes, is thus a form of delusion under Hawkings \\"scientific\\" story.    Amazing the torture people will put their minds through to avoid God. They will even throw out the basis for rationality and science to construct a facade that claims to be science but is poisonous to it. But this is expected.  God necessarily defines rationality. If you reject God, you must reject rationality. Materialisticscience has begun to realize this and the facade of rationality is quickly being jettisoned. Consider:    Everything that has a beginning has a cause. If not -- if things just happen without cause -- it is what people call \\"mysticism\\".     Since space-time had a beginning (based on observational data for the Big Bang and general relativity theory's singularity),  space-time had a cause.    If space-time had a cause (is not mystical in origin), that cause must be independent of space-time -- by necessity. For if the cause is dependent on space-time, it couldn't have caused space-time.     The absence of space-time is what is referred to as \\"eternity\\".  So we arrive logically, observationally, and scientifically at an \\"eternal, creative first cause\\", which happens to be the conception of God advanced by Judeo-Christian theology for thousands of years.    Since God is not defined by space-time, but by eternity, he had no \\"beginning\\" and thus requires no cause. This isn't mystical, only different. If you are not dependent on space-time, the concept of cause is not applicable, by definition.    For a long time, scientists have been bothered by people asking \\"what about BEFORE the Big Bang?\\", having to be honest and not give them an answer. This problem undermines their whole project.  The type of stuff in this book is meant to get around the honesty problem and provide a paper cover that will sound good to the ignorant and allow scientists so-inclined to say SOMETHING (anything!), no matter how dishonest, irrational,  and ridiculous  other scientists know it to be.    It's this realization that drives some scientists to talk about multiverses, no matter the cost to the science and rationality they pretend to advance.  Because if God exists, who will pay any attention to the desperate ramblings of Stephen Hawking?
0439023513|4.0|Spoiler Alert: Do not read this review until you have finished all three books in this amazing series.  The first book of this series was amazing--an all-time great--and while this book did not rise to that standard for me, it nonetheless stayed true to the series and provided appropriate closure to a remarkable tale.  Our heroine has been badly damaged by what she has endured.  While entirely realistic, and indeed, I admire Collins' portrayal for its avoidance of trivializing the impact of the horrors she describes, the result is a final installment that is less exciting, more depressing and less redemptive than the first two entries of the series.  On the other hand, I can think of no more realistic portrayal of war, government and power in a teen genre.  From a teaching perspective, this is miles in front of the admirable Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings series.  Emotionally, though, the pointlessmess of her final quest, during which so many wonderful characters die, left me feeling drained and empty, like Katniss, and without a desire for a book four.  Still, a remarkable series that will stand as a classic for at least a generation.
B0035G0U2O|3.0|2012 was an on the edge of your seat thriller with some of the most imaginative effects I have seen for a while.  Terrifying actually.  But an underlying message that one can glean from it is that having faith in God won't help anyone (unless, the one you serve is the Dalai Lama) and that humanity itself, given the right scenario, will suddenly become loving and kind and good.  Humans are basically selfish - particularly when their self interest is at stake.  If what occurred in this movie happened in real life, the world would not be singing Kumba Yah at the end.  But, overall, it was an engaging story and a well done film, so I give it 3 stars.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|I always felt that John Lennon and Yoko Ono's \\"Double Fantasy\\" was overproduced and a bit cold around the edges. Happily, this \\"stripped down\\" version captures the humor and relaxed charm largely missing from the 1980 release. Yoko's best songs remain tight and punchy, but John's pared-down tracks are a revelation. \\"(Just Like) Starting Over,\\" \\"Cleanup Time,\\" \\"I'm Losing You,\\" \\"Watching the Wheels\\" and \\"Woman\\" come alive in ways never before imagined. Compared to the initial mix, \\"Every Man Has a Woman Who Loves Him\\" now sounds like a dreamy John & Yoko duet. Another pleasant surprise is hearing Lennon's vocals come to the fore on Yoko's \\"Hard Times Are Over.\\" Though both versions of \\"Double Fantasy\\" are worth having, the 2010 remix easily trumps the original album.
0061433047|5.0|This is the fourth book in the Tiffany Aching series. I SHALL WEAR MIDNIGHT refers to Tiffany's promise to don the traditional black garments of a witch when she gets old. Right now, her farm girl's green dress does nicely.<br /><br />In Terry Pratchett's Discworld, a witch is the equivalent of the local social worker: she helps the elderly, teaches good hygiene, treats people and animals who get sick and protects abused children. Tiffany's good with the technical aspects of caring for her people but she has the natural arrogance of a youngster, which annoys some powerful people and attracts the evil attention of the Cunning Man.<br /><br />The Cunning Man starts a whisper campaign against the witches, making people fearful and uneasy. Scared people lash out and Tiffany's an easy target.<br /><br />It doesn't help that her childhood friend and sometime romantic interest, Roland, son of the old Baron, has gotten engaged to a beautiful blond young lady in a white dress. He's also succumbed to his inclination to be a stuffed shirt. When his father dies after a long illness, there's real concern that Roland is going to be ruled by his cruel mother-in-law to be rather than take advice from Tiffany.<br /><br />Tiffany's old friends, the Nac Mac Feegle, are not much good at dealing with unrequited love or whisper campaigns. The threat of a shovel in the wrong place is enough to bring out a chill in Feegle-human relations...but threatening to dig up someone's home is enough to turn anyone fighting mad.<br /><br />I found this book darker and less funny than the three previous books in Tiffany's series, however there's a well of humor that underlies the dark story and I hope we see more of Preston, the most maladroit guard in the annals of fantasy guarding. He provides much of the comic relief and he really has a way with words.
B003DZX44I|5.0|The Blu-ray comes with a DVD, which is quite convenient, so watching it in High-def, which is noticeable, or just watching it is very simple.  The definition in blu-ray is simply amazing, it's beautiful.  You won't regret buying this because it's a timeless classic that you can enjoy over and over again, with family, or by yourself.  It has a bunch of interesting documentaries, and fun games, and bonus features, you will never get tired of this Blu-ray.  Disney's Diamond collection is off to a great start.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|If you ever wondered what all this beautiful Christmas music would sound like sung by the very angels of Heaven, I'm willing to bet that it sounds a little something like this.  My personal favorites on this album are her soft rendition of Silent Night, and her unique take on The First Noel.  But the entire CD is wonderful and hers is not a voice you can grow tired of.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I HAD TO UP-DATE THIS REVIEW, SINCE I NOTICED SO MANY \\"ALLEGED\\" DIE-HARD MADONNA FANS GAVE THIS CD A BAD REVIEW. MADONNA DID WORK WITH PRODUCERS THAT EVERYONE ELSE ALREADY USED, BUT MADONNA STILL MAKES EVERYTHING SHE TOUCHES HER OWN.  SO GET OVER IT!<br /><br />AFTER 4 YEARS OF CONTINUALLY LISTENING TO THIS CD. I FIGURED IT WAS TIME TO WRITE A REVIEW.  THIS IS LADY M'S BEST PROJECT SINCE 'BEDTIME STORIES' YES, BOTH CD'S ARE VERY URBAN & IT'S CLEAR THAT MADONNA WAS GOING FOR A YOUTHFUL GENRE. BUT THE MAJOR ISSUE WITH THE CD IS WARNER BROS.  THIS CD RECIEVED ZERO MARKETING & PROMOTION, WHICH WAS DONE ON PURPOSE BY W.B. WHY? AFTER THE NASTY FALL-OUT OVER MAVERICK RECORDS, MADONNA DECIDED TO LEAVE AFTER HER CONTRACT WAS UP. SO OUT OF SPITE, THEY ALLOWED HER LAST CD TO FLOP. ORGINALLY THE FIRST SINGLE WAS SUPPOSE TO BE 'BEAT GOES ON' WITH KANYE WEST, BUT THEY DECIDED ON '4 MINUTES' WHICH WAS A GOOD CHOICE.  BUT WHY WOULD THEY RELEASE 'GIVE IT 2 ME' HORRID SONG, THAT WENT NOWHERE.  I LOVE 'MILES AWAY' BUT UNFORTUNAELY THAT WENT NOWHERE EITHER.  ANYTIME U HAVE A SONG WITH KANYE WEST (WHO'S RHYMES WERE OFF THE CHAIN ON THIS TRACK) & U DON'T RELEASE THAT SONG, SOMETHING IS WRONG! 'BEAT GOES ON' IS ONE OF THE BEST TRACKS ON THE CD, BUT WARNER BROS. STILL REFUSED TO RELEASE IT, EVEN THOUGH THEY KNEW IT WAS RECIEVING GOOD RADIO & CLUB AIRPLAY.<br /><br />'BEAT GOES ON', 'CANDY SHOP', 'SPANISH LESSON' & 'HEARTBEAT' WERE ALL CLUB BANGER'S WHICH WERE PLAYED IN THE CLUBS & WOULD HAVE DONE WELL ON THE CHARTS WITH THE RIGHT RADIO PROMOTION. TRUST ME, I WORK IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, IT'S IMPERATIVE TO HAVE GOOD PROMOTION! HARD CANDY IS MADONNA'S MOST COMMERCIAL & RADIO FRIENDLY PROJECT SINCE 'BEDTIME STORIES'.  IT HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE MADONNA'S COMEBACK CD, BUT WARNER BROS. MADE DAMN SURE THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.  MY SUGGESTION IF U LIKE MADONNA'S R&B SOUND, HARD CANDY IS DEFINITELY 'STICKY & SWEET' & MADONNA PROVES HER SUGAR IS STILL RAW... LOL....  BUY IT, NOW!!! (NO-BOOTLEGGING)<br /><br />I ALSO WANT TO GIVE PROPS TO THE PRODUCERS: THE NEPTUNES (PARTICULARLY PHARRELL), TIMBERLAND, JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE & DANJA. THE BEATS ARE 'SICK' ON THIS CD. MADONNA PROVES ONCE AGAIN, SHE HAS TALENT WHEN IT COMES TO COLLABORATING, & SHE KNOWS WHAT SOUND WORKS BEST FOR HER.

0790744295|3.0|Remember watching it growing up and thinking it wasn't that scary and even less so now,but still a fun film. I don't follow What it's based on(comics) but I do like the movie, You have A goofy Stephen King,a serious Leslie Nielsen,Adrienne Barbeau..The one story that sticks out in my mind is \\"Where's my Cake!!...\\" Ah!...  Sometimes it's funny, and then the Leslie Nielsen/Ted Danson story. It's a Classic even if cheesy and zany.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|Chuck is in one word 'Awesome'! This season was just as good as the last two. I don't know why some people don't think so. Some cite Chuck's new abilities for their dislike of the season, they say the show has 'changed too much'. I think if a show and its characters don't change and grow then it becomes boring and is soon destined to die. That being said, if the characters and show advance and change too quickly it can kill the show. But I don't think this is the case with season 3 of Chuck, I think the growth of the characters matches the timeline and show's progression just fine. New and exciting developments, and character back stories makes it interesting and leaves you craving more. There's nothing worse than a show that follows along the same old path episode to episode, season to season it's just boring and it begs to be put out of its misery. What makes a story worthwhile is how it unfolds, the twist and turns, the growth of the characters, character's back stories, etc. In fact the most important aspect to a story is having character's that people can get to know and come to care about. I personally loved this season and enjoyed it immensely, Chuck is still the Chuck we know and love and the show is still the same action packed, dramatic, witty and humorous spy spoof it has always been. I cannot wait for season 4!
B0010HOZS0|2.0|Invasion of the body snatchers is a classic movie from the 50's. THE 1970's version starring donald sutherland and early 90's version starring meg tilly  are also very good but his version is the new hollywood happy ending version. Even the excellent acting of Nicole kidman adn danial craig  can't help this because of the ending. The movie is similiar at first to the other versions and the premise remains excellent only this time there's no pods which also lessons the sense of alienation and change. On blu ray this one looks great but the movie itself lost all sense of what the real story was about. The other three versions remain well worth owning though.
B003UERZ88|3.0|This Cd is ok a few good songs a few weird songs and bubblegum songs so as a die hard Halford /Judas Priest fan its very hard for me to listen to when there are newer bands like Primal Fear who basically stole Halfords voice but really do make it sound so good and I like it . So I think your better off going with something like Primal Fear or Theocracy
0312600844|5.0|I found Jonathan Franzen's Freedom to be a very good [if not great] American novel because it accurately represents the times we are living in. I found the author's ideas about contemporary America interesting [and mostly true]. I appreciated his sense of social conscience and offbeat sense of humor. Also, Franzen writes in a style I find remarkably readable, in spite of his long, complex sentences. I read it in four days; 150 pages a day means that a book is really holding my attention. It was well written, had suspense, conflict, quirky characters whose thoughts and actions I could sometimes identify with and ideas that resonated with me. [I was born in the early 50's. This novel might resonate more with baby boomers than, say, readers who are younger than 30. Maybe. Or maybe not. It will depend on the reader's response.]<br /><br />If you count the last chapter, \\"Canterbridge Estates Lake\\" as an epilogue, and then open the book to almost exactly the middle, you'll find the gist of Freedom. [I don't think it's an accident that the crux of the matter is located exactly halfway through. See pages 266 thru 270. This novel has been lovingly crafted by a technically proficient author.] After this most meaningful discourse, Joey and Jonathan sneak off to the kitchen and pour the dregs of other peoples' wine into two large glasses and sneak off to the basement with it. [My interpretation of this is that truth, when we come very close to really seeing it, is almost too much for us to deal with and we need to buffer it with some sort of barrier - in this case alcohol. Or maybe it assaults our senses when we see another persons truth clearly?] For those who don't have a copy of the book on hand, the \\"meaningful discourse,\\" or \\"gist\\" is:<br /><br />\\"I owe a lot to my great grandfather who came over here with nothing. He was given an opportunity in this country, which gave him the freedom to make the most of his abilities. That's why I've chosen to spend my life to honor that freedom and try to ensure that the next American century be similarly blessed. Nothing wrong with making money, nothing at all. But there has to be something more in your life than that. You have to choose which side you're on and fight for it\\" (270).<br /><br />My other interpretation of these pages is: We all lie, we all see truth differently, one person's freedom will most definitely encroach on another persons freedom, the very fact that we are fortunate enough to live under freedom is built on foundations of previous civilizations from the Greeks, to those in the Valley of Mesopotamia, to more lately, the Victorians. [Patty and Walter renovated an old Victorian; raised their family over a Victorian foundation. And while I'm on the Victorians, I'm wondering if people in that age would've handled a rape much differently than Patty's parents handled hers?]<br /><br />Having had my little rant, I would now like to say, \\"dopplerpus.\\" Ha, ha, what a concept! Loved it. [Would like to ask the author: Did you make this up or did somebody really do this?]<br /><br />The characters are often dramatically ironic and reveal Franzen's offbeat sense of humor, sarcasm, wit and the fact that he is a keen observer of our (American) behavior:  Vin Haven? [Think Vineyard Haven, where the very rich are entrenched; where the very rich are not like you and me.]<br /><br />THE MAIN CHARACTERS:<br /><br />Patty who constantly contradicts herself \\"was strictly a lyrics-and-stories gal and never tired of cheating men and strong women and the indomitable human spirit.\\"  One of the funniest bits in the book is said by Patty, a character who is very checked into her own little world: \\"We're headed for a total collapse...So, I might as well go ahead and buy myself some tits.\\" Patty was also needy [she ranked her need to party and to try to connect above her daughter's need to study] and then she immediately saw on the \\"stone graven with words of wisdom: Use Well Thy Freedom.\\" [Yup, he's gifted, Franzen is.]<br /><br />Walter: obsessed with issues, especially the environment, particularly conservation. Walter is so obsessive-compulsive about conservation that he is willing to sacrifice the environment in order to save it. Pertinent environment information is revealed via Walter: Not just the industrial farming but also the sprawl, the sprawl, the sprawl. Low-density development is the worst. And SUVs everywhere, snowmobiles everywhere, Jet Skis everywhere, ATVs everywhere, two-acre (chemical drenched) lawns everywhere. We might have enough land for other species to survive it wasn't all so fragmented. I learned about The Club of Rome, devoted to exploring the limits of growth, from Walter. More from Walter: It wasn't just the jumbo everything his fellow Americans felt entitled to, it wasn't just the Walmarts and the buckets of corn syrup and the high-clearance monster trucks; it was the feeling that nobody was giving a second's thought to what it meant to be packing another 13 million large primates onto the planet's finite surface every month.

Walter is so obsessive-compulsive about conservation that he is willing to sacrifice the environment in order to save it. Pertinent environment information is revealed via Walter: Not just the industrial farming but also the sprawl, the sprawl, the sprawl. Low-density development is the worst. And SUVs everywhere, snowmobiles everywhere, Jet Skis everywhere, ATVs everywhere, two-acre (chemical drenched) lawns everywhere. We might have enough land for other species to survive it wasn't all so fragmented. I learned about The Club of Rome, devoted to exploring the limits of growth, from Walter. More from Walter: It wasn't just the jumbo everything his fellow Americans felt entitled to, it wasn't just the Walmarts and the buckets of corn syrup and the high-clearance monster trucks; it was the feeling that nobody was giving a second's thought to what it meant to be packing another 13 million large primates onto the planet's finite surface every month.

B0000509C4|3.0|A slight improvement over part 1 but still A fun even if cheesy/zany and at times funny horror movie, I also saw this growing up and I enjoyed it. My Favorite being the Lake story and the Indian/Native American coming back to avenge.
B002ZG977Y|2.0|But then again you're not watching this movie for its great dialog.  COTT is a fun movie and it does have some fine battle scenes. All other characters are basically expendable with the exception of Ralph Finnes who does a super job as Hades. This is a weak movie as far as plot goes.  The plot, what there is of it, is hard to follow and the characters are mysteries and not well defined.     Having said that the scene with Medusa is very enjoyable and is a great battle scene. But sadly, this version pales in comparison to the original with Harry Hamlin. Camp will always beat out bad!
030745455X|1.0|I like The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo very much but was very disappointed in this book and finally put it down 2/3rd of the way through.<br /><br />** Minor Spoilers **<br /><br />Things that caused this novel to run off the rails for me:<br /><br />1.  The critical problem was that the main protaganists became less sympathetic making me less forgiving of the other flaws in the book.  Lisbeth becomes a super hero with vastly increased strengths (world-class hacker, excellent mathematician, chess-player, and linguist, scrappy fighter, and now fabulously wealthy) but lessened weaknesses.  People refer to her as having Asperger's but she seems to have no problems socializing when she wants to deceive (i.e. multiple expert disguises/personas to embezzle huge sums of money) and interpreting people's emotions and their plans.  Even the fact she breaks into the computer of everyone she knows/invades their privacy seems to be overlook and written off and a personality quirck.  Mikael's habitual womanizing with few negative consequences (still friends with most of his lovers) run thins also.<br /><br />2.  Never misses an opportunity to hit you over the head about social injustice--granted everyone condemns social injustice but I am reading a thriller not a paper from Amnesty International.<br /><br />3.  Too much detail--endless descriptions of mundance things that have no bearing on the plot (i.e. do I really need to know the name of all the IKEA furniture she bought).<br /><br />4.  Cardboard supporting cast--either honest and kind hearted or nasty and evil with no middle ground.<br /><br />5.  I was interested in the developing relationship between the two main charcaters in the first book and now there is almost no interaction between them.<br /><br />Wanted to like it but could not even finish it.
1439165645|4.0|This book caught my eye in a NPR Book Review, and I bought it straight away.An easy and amusing read, right in line for two-hours on a cool fall day. The small portion of the book actually set in India, caught the sights, smells, the over-crowds of the sub-continent, several characters expansively larger than life, less interesting when central figure went French.
0143118420|2.0|I can find diamonds in the rough this book. There are a great many memorable, comical  and/or insightful quotes. However, mostly I'm thinking that Elizabeth Gilbert is certifiably insane. She can write, there's no doubt about that. It's just what she chooses to write about that gets my hackles up. Her neurotic over analysis of her life gets tedious really fast. If I wanted to relive a metaphysical crisis, I'd write my own memoir, thank you very much. I keep wondering how they turned this festival of self indulgent, self loathing into a movie. I probably should have saved myself the trouble and watched it instead of investing my time in reading the book.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I LOVED Daria from the very first episode, and always wished that MTV would release a box set of the entire series. I was really glad that I stumbled across this on Amazon. The only thing that I *don't* love is that due to royalties, I think, some of the background music has changed. There's a note explaining this in the case. In most cases, I don't even miss the songs that had been used in the series, but when the joke is about the music playing, it's a little noticeable. The only example I can think of is that in one episode, they are waiting in traffic and they're spoofing the \\"Everybody Hurts\\" video, but some generic music is playing. Other than that instance, however, it's not really a big deal. If you love (and miss) Daria, you'll enjoy this.
B001MYIXAC|2.0|I will start by saying I am a total horror/gore fan.  I was not impressed with this movie at all.  I thought it was too slowly paced and pretty boring at times.  I don't see how a few kills make up for minutes upon minutes of boring dialogue.  I was not interested in the artsy fartsy scenery or child to child conversation and just found this movie to be painfully dull.  My husband thought it was OK, I have to disagree.  As a matter of fact, I gave this movie 2 stars and that's being kind.
B003ZW0MS0|5.0|74 year young Buddy is alive and kicking again, the LP in the vain of Skin deep however many cuts with wild guitar similar to Smell a rat, value added of Santana on 1 song equals zero, cut with BBKing very subtle and catchy, you will love it no surprise, old wine rules
B003EYVXT6|1.0|I got to see a FREE sneak preview of this movie before it hit theaters and knew that there were going to be some morally ambiguous situations, but was intrigued by the trailer.  However, I wasn't prepared for how DISTURBING this movie ended up being.  And the suspense that it advertised in the previews was, for the most part, nonexistent.  This movie was more liken to \\"The Fly\\" (which was a much better film) than any other movie I can think of.  Most of the movie involves the 2 scientists pushing beyond the ethical barriers in order to make a scientific discovery that would fund their research and secure their jobs by making their financier wealthy.  I mean, people want to demonize the pharmaceutical companies who spend millions of dollars in research and experimentation to create a drug that is a treatment or cure for incurable illnesses, but expect it to initially be cheap. Somebody has to pay for it, and the Pharmaceutical companies aren't in it for charity.  But, I digress since that is a different subject, but related to part of the story.  Overall the story for the first 2/3 of the movie wasn't great, but wasn't bad either.  However, the last 1/3 was just morally twisted and DEPRAVED on several levels.  I wished I could sponge away the images from my brain after watching it.  And the overall reaction of the audience after the movie was over was \\"EEEWWWWWWW! That was really TWISTED!\\"  I would NOT recommend this movie to ANYBODY and in fact told all my friends NOT to waste their money viewing it.
0345505387|1.0|Beautiful Artwork by Hoang Nguyen gets a gold star...  Gabaldon killing the Outlander Series once again doesn't even rate any stars.      Look, I will always adore Outlander and hold it Sacred in my heart.  But Gabaldon's gotta stop beating the dead horse. It reeks of greed.  Especially given that this Graphic Novel only covers the first 1/3rd of Outlander.  Y'know what that means, right?    I decided to check out a copy from the library due to curiosity. It's disturbing how many times Gabaldon needs to revisit and warp scenes from the original book. I'm in favor of preserving the INTEGRITY of Jamie & Claire.     Although I like the artwork (the scenery, the imagery), the characters didn't look like those so beautifully depicted in the actual book, Outlander. Murtagh doesn't even look like anything that Outlander describes and I kept confusing him with Dougal (in this graphic novel)...  I prefer the movie in my head, thank you.    The fanatics here will always support Gabaldon and follow her down the Rabbit Hole.  But I say: Enough Already.  Enough.

B002LII6KA|5.0|I remember about 2 years ago, I had all 3 Matrix movies on DVD, which were the single releases, and a friend of mine wanted to buy them off me, 'cause he couldn't find them anywhere around here, like a dummy, I sold them, only to realize after how stupid I was for doing it because I wanted to watch them, and looked for them in my DVD collection, they weren't there, then I remembered, I SOLD THEM!, and missed the movies very much until I got this set.    I was happy as a lark when I got this, because not only did I have all 3 movies again, but it's even better than what I had before, because not only is this set the complete series, but you get a TON of extras, and it is all packaged very nicely, and the outer box is gorgeous.    Now of course you get all 3 movies, but there's a little extra...THIS IS A 10 DISC SET!, so you get each movie on it's own single disc of course, but then you get 'The Matrix Revisited' for each movie on a separete disc, which is well worth it for this set alone, but wait, there's more, you also get 'The Animatrix' 'The Roots of The Matrix' 'The Burly Man Chronicles' and 'The Zion Archive' so yeah, I'd say Warner Brothers gave us Matrix fans some extras, and at a reasonable price as well, I paid $40.00 and it is certainly worth that.    The movies? Well I don't need to explain those, any Matrix fan knows how great these are, although the 3rd one isn't as good as the first 2, but still solid, so bottom line, if you're a Matrix fan, this set is a must have, you will be watching the extras for days.

B003TJ4YU6|1.0|There is no discussion about how great these shows were.  I was lucky enough to experience them on tv in 1964.  The 2003 edition was wonderful.  When the studio that remastered these dvds said that they were going to<br />clean up the film \\"frame by frame\\", I was expecting a significant improvement.  When I compared each show to the 2003 dvd, the 2nd show seemed brighter, but there was no improved video or sound definition.  The other<br />3 shows were inferior in clarity.  How can these people take a step backwards in quality, and sell the product as being remastered?  For the best product, seek the 2003 version.  Note, the bonus material is worthless.<br />A more appropriate bonus might have been to include the beatles' rehearsal songs which you can see on you tube for the 1964 performances.
B0000019PA|5.0|How can I begin to describe something like Neutral Milk Hotel's \\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea?\\" It's like no other record I've heard in my young life. But like many of my favorite albums, indie rock and otherwise, it moves me.  There are beautiful and memorable songs on this release, such as the title track and \\"King of Carrot Flowers Pt. 1.\\" There are also a number of stark, haunting compositions like \\"The Fool\\" and \\"Ghost\\" that surprise the listener and sound better with mulitple listens. The key ingredient is the ragged yet singular voice of Jeff Mangum. His bandmates complete the experience by playing an array of captivating instruments, many of which I have never heard of. Lyrically this is a very complex record, referencing the tragedy of Anne Frank in a broader narrative of spiritual transcendence. This is a difficult record, but I think that is one reason why so many people hold it in high regard. It's the good kind of difficult: one that strikes a perfect balance of puzzlement and wonderment. Simply put, ITAOTS is an Everest of a record: a bold statement maybe, but once you listen to it you will know what I mean.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|All I need to know now is why the &#34;Creators&#34; freaking left them in a maze with no immediately visible exit for two years.
B003VS0CYC|4.0|Just to let everyone know if they are wondering the quality of this release on Blu Ray. I could not find any reviews that could give a good review on this set online since this set just came out. I have the Standard dvd version of the trilogy and I just recently got the Blu Ray version and did a comperison of them both. Your not going to get a crystal clear picture with the age of these movies unless the studio decides to spend the time and money doing a big picture cleaning restore like George Lucas or James Cameron would do with with their movies in the studio. It does sound better and the colors on blu ray do look better compared to the standard dvd. I was amazed how when Ed-209 in the first robo-cop made my sub-woofer on my surround system thump loud and robo-cops foot slaming on the ground as he get out the police car to fight crime. This set does contain the unrated edition of the first Robo-Cop. If you are buying this for sharp picture quality you will be disapointed. All 3 films do contain certain amounts of grain in the picture. The picture will balance from looking good to high amounts of grain in the video. It seems what the studio did was just take the video from the standard dvd set and put the video and sound onto blu ray uncompressed. I like the first 2 movies the most the third one was ok. Maybe the 3rd one could have been better if Peter Weller was Robo-Cop instead of the other actor that replaced him. I have seen all 3 of these in the theaters back then when they were released. I just wish the studios would have done a better job at restoring these movies better on blu ray. There are fans out there that do like Robo-Cop and would love to see better restored versions of these films.  I would rather watch the blu ray version of all 3 movies on a nice surround sound system than the standard dvd. The 4 stars are for having all 3 movies in one set and the upgraded sound on all 3 movies in the set compared to the standard dvd.If you dont have this set atall and a Robo-Cop fan pick this up on blu ray.

0316098337|5.0|This book was truly excellent.  I see some people had trouble with the book being narrated by the 5 year old boy Jack, but it stopped bothering me a quarter of the way through, and although some will disagree, I truly feel the book would not be as good without his narration.  I usually don't read this type of book, so it was a pleasant surprise to have enjoyed it so much, even if it was hard to read at times (because of the dark material).  I am very close with my mother so this really hit home for me.  I laughed and cried, and now that I am finished reading it, I am truly happy I stumbled upon this book.
B003EYVXSW|1.0|I can't believe Adrian Brody, who won an Oscar for his role in the Pianist, starred in this movie. He must have really needed the money because there weren't any redeeming qualities about his character or the entire movie.<br /><br />The plot was predictable and stupid (there is no way two so called scientists would abandon all logic and do the things they did) and the ending was supposed to be ominous, but was just shallow. By then, I didn't care what happened to Sarah Polley's character. She deserved whatever she got for being brain-dead and selfish throughout the film. But, I also didn't feel sorry for the creature because the director never spent enough time trying to get you to empathize with her. All of the characters were very weak.<br /><br />As far as this movie being some sort of commentary on the struggles of being a parent and having to make tough choices for your children when you know they are \\"different\\" - that's just bull. There was no moral to this story.<br /><br />It was just dumb and dumber. Don't waste your money!
1595141979|5.0|3rd installment of the series goes dark and depressing. Recommended for romance and action lovers. I definately wouldn't want to be Rose when she figured out the true meaning of being shadow kissed. She starts to question whether or not life would be better as a blood whore. She starts to wonder whether Lissa needs her specificaly. That's when the tragedy happens. Read this entrancing book to find out what happens to Rose, her forbidden love, and Lissa by reading this book. Most will not want to put this book down.

Watching our favorite , Ed Sullivan , and the Beatles came on as they did. We had not heard of them before this , and they were mesmorizing. I was 8 and that next week I had no trouble getting my Mom to go with me to buy me there 1st album , which was my first album purchase ever. A life long fan. Anyway , this DVD took me right back in an instant. Wow.
B00383ZTXO|3.0|I've owned this since 1976 and found it difficult then and now to listen too in its entirety. Recording quality is splattered in 360 directions.  It certainly has its moments. Gimme Danger-incredible and can't be without while Doojiman is nonsense and much like Mott the Hooples' \\"The Wheel of the Quivering Meat Conception\\"    Part way through listening to this I was politely asked to put on my head phones.    You may want to do the same to protect your family and neighbor's mental sanity.    Not for the trepid.
B003XWEQ1G|3.0|The main risk this movie takes is to portray the \\"making\\" of the man who could split arrows rather than retelling the memorable legend of old.  Though historians dispute whether Robin Hood exists or not, the aim of the film was to deliver a more realistic look at what the man may have been like.  Did this effort end up scoring Ridley Scott a bullseye?  I'd call it close but no cigar.<br /><br />While the above paragraph gives the impression that this is a biographical narrative, this film is far from this.  The movie is riddled with heavy action and war sequences.  Much of the plot is moved by fighting as opposed to storytelling.  Though this may not differ from films with similar formulas there are some stark differences.  Take for example another Russel Crowe film Gladiator.  Much of the magic of the movie is \\"the sands of the Coliseum.\\"  The difference between Gladiator and this film however, is that the battles that take place in the Coliseum do not dwarf the narrative itself.<br /><br />Despite the story's tedium, the actors help keep the film together and make it an enjoyable viewing experience.  Crowe has a sort of scruffy charm that can make him pull off a slew of characters. His portrayal of Robin is slightly more towards the grizzly side but gives the hero an air of fortitude and strength.  Blanchett's Maid Marian is also delightful to watch and is full of wit.  She's certainly no damsel in distress and can definitely take care of herself without the help of a knight in shining armor.  Even Isaac's Prince John is worthy of mention due to his great portrait of a man full of delusions of grandeur and self-righteous importance.  It is Robin's band of merry men though that the good performances end sadly.<br /><br />Ultimately, this version of Robin Hood lies on the edge of an arrow between good and poor.  If the script had gotten a few more treatments, and a couple dabs of the old legend thrown into the mix, it would have been immensely better.  Perhaps if it leaned more toward Sherwood Forest and less toward English nationalism.  I truly hope in the future, movies will follow such a formula in telling the story of this iconic character of literature.  Unfortunately, its hard to say whether the public would even be interested in another Robin Hood after having stomached countless retellings to date.wood Forest and less toward English nationalism.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book is as good as the first, City of Bones, and will keep you coming for more.    I figured out why I love reading Cassandra Claire while reading this: The story CONSTANTLY keeps you guessing. She is very spontaneous, and will always keep you guessing, more than you'll ever expect.    Point being, you HAVE to read this book if you've read City of Bones, if you haven't you should go pick up City of Bones and enjoy!
B0007LXPBI|5.0|I've seen this movie so many times and absolutely LOVE it! My daughter (18) and I (46) enjoy watching it together. Having it on VHS, we've watched it numerous times and never tire of it. We decided we needed to get it on DVD, so I ordered it a few days ago from AMAZON, not from one of the \\"other sellers.\\" I was thrilled to get it, right up until I looked at the back of the case, and saw stamped on the plastic cover in bright blue \\"Disc Made in Mexico\\". Also, there isn't the \\"sticky seal\\" on the top of the plastic case, as all NEW DVD's have. I have to wonder why Amazon would not mention that this DVD was made in Mexico. I purchased a USA item, and got a foreign made item. Amazon, how many more DVD's are you selling as USA, but the actual disc is made in another country?? I'm sorely disappointed in Amazon, and will be looking for other places to purchase the many DVD's that I buy.

B000001GGV|5.0|For the average classical-music loving listener I would recommend this as an excellent selection of Scarlatti sonatas.  For someone like me, also a keyboardist,  it is a cause for the celebration of supreme music-making. The sheer rhythmic drive of Pogorelich's playing even in the quietest, slowest moments reveals one master expressing another.  Each sonata is revealed as a highly concentrated universe.   Listen to the regal command of K. 450.  Listen to the sheer exuberance of K. 159.  Listen to K. 87, its quiet, intense expression.

B003JIPJRE|4.0|This is definitely a very, very mature batman movie from the gruesome opening sequence to the last act. Not for the younger kids, in my opinion. The action is amazing, fast paced, edgy and very well animated and the story itself (including dialogue)is very impressive but make no mistake, the violence, though not gory, is there, it doesn't pull any punches and is a departure from other batman animated movies. I personally enjoyed it since it added to the tension and seriousness of the overall story line. The voice acting was alright. Idk if some of the people chosen to do the voices should have been. Batman, Night Wing and the joker all seemed off, vocally, to me. It didn't take away from the movie but it was noticeable to me. Batman is darker and harder which is a welcome reprieve from the usual mainstream dark and brooding attitude we are used to seeing. Batman's response to the Red Hoods points about dealing with certain super criminals was dark, straight to the point and unexpected and was something, I feel, fans have needed to hear from him for some time. The movie is, without a doubt, an elevation of the Batman on every level. That may sound odd since it is a cartoon movie but this isn't your typical Batman cartoon movie from start to finish.  I gave it 4 stars because I felt some (and I mean very few) of the smaller aspects of the story were predictable but I won't mention them since it comes from a personal PoV and others may not see it that way. Red Hood is very dark, very mature, very entertaining, has perfect animation and is, over all, a great movie and definitely worth a watch.
B002VECM6S|5.0|If there were an ounce of honesty in the process of naming this movie, they should have abandoned the book title and simply called it \\"The Under Armour Movie\\".<br /><br />I am a big fan of Sandra Bullock and she is never better than in this flick.<br /><br />The story is great, the acting is great, but in practically every other shot (and I'm being generous here), someone is conspicuously wearing Under Armour athletic gear.<br /><br />It actually became a running joke with the people I watched the movie with, and thus slightly detracted from the movie.<br /><br />I know this is a sports movie and everyone is wearing Under Armour these days, but please.<br /><br />I have never felt so clobbered over the head by product placement.  To say simply that it is overdone here is to completely minimize the onslaught.<br /><br />I love this movie and continue to watch it.  But my friends and I are honest and call it what it is.<br /><br />I'll get a call and get the question, \\"You wanna watch the Under Armour movie tonight?\\"  And I say, \\"Sure!\\"
1427210497|2.0|I enjoyed the first 1/3 of the audiobook of \\"Freedom\\".  The narrator's voice is engaging and the novel paints a very realistic picture of modern day \\"traditional\\" middle class life.  The sketched outline of this family and their closest circle of relationships is interesting and well drawn.<br /><br />As the picture gains depth and color, however, the picture becomes far less attractive and far more difficult to look at.  Not so much because the reader is gaining insight behind the shiny, happy exterior of the Berglund family, but because the reader learns FAR too much about them.  Most of them, that is.  Of the family of four, much is detailed about three of them, and one is virtually ignored in comparison.  It feels as if more time is spent talking about cats and birds than the Berglund's daughter, Jessica.<br /><br />Once I realized how bleak and depressing this story was and how wildly unlikable these characters are - I ran into one of the problems with an audiobook.  There's no skimming, no skipping ahead.  Except for the one track describing a scene so crude and nausea inducing that I was forced to skip it, I was in this for 25 unabridged hours.  I'm a pretty fast reader, and had I had the actual book, I don't think I would have been experiencing \\"Freedom\\" for quite so long.<br /><br />This is a picture of modern day life that made me dislike every character, dislike all of the aspects of the political spectrum that are described (including my own), and stop caring what happened to any of them.

0786956291|4.0|This introductory boxed set to the 4th edition of the Dungeons & Dragons is mostly \\"hit\\", with a few \\"misses\\". Generally, it is way better than any of the other introductory product to the game that preceded it during the 3rd or 4th edition of the game.<br /><br />It is *not* the equivalent of the legendary \\"Red Box\\" D&D authored by Frank Mentzer in 1983, in the sense that it does not provide a fully functional game system in and of itself. It is more comparable to the Holmes \\"Blue Book\\" D&D of 1977, in fact, in that it does provide a few character levels, means to create characters via an entertaining \\"choose your own adventure\\" text which also manages to teach you some of the fundamentals of role playing games, and then provides whoever chooses to run the game as \\"Dungeon Master\\" with enough material to run a few adventures up to the end of the 2nd character level, at which point it assumes you will upgrade to the full D&D Essentials line of products, that is, [[ASIN:0786956208 Heroes of the Fallen Lands: An Essential Dungeons & Dragons Supplement (4th Edition D&D)]] for players, [[ASIN:0786956305 Dungeon Master's Kit: An Essential Dungeons & Dragons Kit (4th Edition D&D)]] for DMs, and [[ASIN:0786956216 Rules Compendium: An Essential Dungeons & Dragons Compendium (4th Edition D&D)]] for both players and DMs, at a minimum.<br /><br />You get a lot of stuff for the price you pay. Maps, tokens to represent monsters and characters, seven sheets of power cards (9 detachable cards per sheet), four printed character sheets, a coupon giving you access to another \\"choose your own adventure\\" module you can download from WotC's website, a set of polyhedral dice for use with the game, the Player's Book, and the DM's Book. That's a very good value for the amount of money spent on the product, in my opinion, whether you end up playing the game or not.<br /><br />Now, there are some areas in which the game can be confusing. Some options in the \\"choose your own adventure\\" Player's Book might make you miss some steps in building your own character, which you'd have to figure out on your own by flipping back and forth through the book at some point. Some of the powers and abilities for characters described in this book does not match the powers and abilities of characters in the wider Essentials line of products. There is a strong emphasis on tactical, board-based game play, which may or may not be a plus to some people, depending on their own play styles and tendencies.<br /><br />So it's far from perfect. Nonetheless, I think that it does its job nicely. It's a decent, good game product that you will play for a little while, before upgrading to the other Essentials product. In that sense, it hits the mark. In the sense of a fully playable, self-contained and endlessly replayable game, it fails miserably. But that is not what this game brands itself: it is an introduction product, and I rate it as such: Good, or 4 on 5.miss some steps in building your own character, which you'd have to figure out on your own by flipping back and forth through the book at some point.

0439023521|5.0|It took me a while to decide whether or not I want to read this trilogy. I was skeptical of all the hype, because of the Twilight craze that suddenly swept the nation and I thought that this series would be another waste of trees.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />As soon as I started reading I was captured by the story. I don't know what it is about Collins writing but I just could not put it down, of course I had to for work and school but as soon as I had a chance to I was cracking it open and reading more and more. This book impressed me in its simplicity and in its underlying message. Collins has written a stirring first-person narrative and didn't let any of her side characters fall by the wayside. Hunger Games is easily my second favorite book.
0553573403|2.0|BEcause of the praise for this book, I struggled through. Halfway, I realized it wasn't worth it. The characters have little depth. The personalities are non-existent leaving the reader unable to tell them apart. Everything is handed to the reader leaving nothing to the imagination. It could be a stage play except it is as interesting as the stage directions.

1572705523|5.0|This is a superb reading by Sarah Badel. I can find nothing to carp about; she scans the language with such assurance and close attention to the meaning that she shows up the deficiencies in almost every other Austen reading known to me. In most cases these readers brush over and miss the point of Austen's remarks but Badel is so clearcut and precise she consistently illuminates the writing rather than obscuring it as so many others do.<br /><br />It may however be a little understated for some listeners. She is rarely overtly dramatic but then neither is Austen. I think Sarah Badel tracks the author's lightly satirical voice almost perfectly but if you prefer a more animated reading you might try some alternative versions.

0375842381|5.0|These books have to be some of my favorite books of all times. Those that gave it bad reviews likely had a negative reaction to the anti-Christian message of the trilogy. I have to admit that there are times when I almost felt bad reading it- essentially killing God is not on the list of things I would have thought I'd like to read about. However, in the end, I felt that it was actually a mind-opening experience. I would absolutely recommend these books to anyone who loves fantasy (especially those Harry Potter lovers!!). Plus, the books are pretty well written which is more than I can say for many other books on the market these days...
0345505387|5.0|I read a lot of negative feedback from \\"devoted fans\\" and I'm surprised how unforgiving they are of creative expression. This story is adapted to fit into a graphic novel format; think of it as if you were to be animated in The Simpsons, you don't get to look like your real self, you look like a Simpson's character with your features. The Exile is just a different, and beautiful, view of the story. I enjoyed reading it, just like I enjoyed reading Outlander. I have to wonder if Diana's \\"devoted fans\\" will even enjoy a movie adaptation.

B002BWQ6H6|5.0|This was such a wonderfully imagined and written series of stories that ultimately form an engrossing novel.  Mr. McCann well deserves all of the accolades he has received for his work.  My only difficulty (if you want to call it that) was that I could not spend longer stretches reading the book-I think the more time you can devote to reading would make the book flow better and better.  Well done!
0553805371|5.0|This was the longest short book I have read as yet.     For a non-physicist like me, it was a heavenly gift. Stephen Hawkings has the unique way of explaining to a layman like me what it is all about; where we are and how we got here.  It is pure reasoning and logic. No preconceived notions, no premonitions.     Some claim that there is no other scientist of equivalent stature between him and Einstein.     He tells the story of early thinking human beings and how they questioned the nature of their own being and the universe at large. We as humans have existed for 200,0000 years but learnt to read and write only 7000 years back. The first thinkers were perhaps Ionians (present day Turkey). It deals with the questions early Ionians asked for example, as humans infants cannot take care of themselves, the first humans would not have surfaced as infants.      He then argues that as the philosophers have failed to answer the question of life and universe, the scientists have to do their part.     The book takes you to a tour de force of subatomic physics and the laws of forces which govern them and how we came to know about it all.     There are four major forces in nature, electromagnetic, week nuclear force, strong nuclear force and gravity.      It was very gratifying and I felt proud to see the name of Abdus Salam in the book. He is credited with the theory of week nuclear forces.This force is responsible for the radioactivity and plays a vital role in the formation of elements in stars and early universe. He and others theorized that in  1967, were awarded Nobel in 1979. The W and Z particles which he theorized were observed however only in 1983.     It is now known that the universe is expanding. It leads to a simple question. Going back, it would have been almost nothing. As more we understand the way the nature works, the less one has to burden the gods and heavenly beings for the work of nature. He, contrary to my preconceived bias of Hawkings, does not make anaggressive attempt to discredit god. He merely makes an argument that spontaneous creation is a possibility.     It is a marvellously easy read for the level of complex theoretical physics it teaches you along the way; all the way to the ultimate 11-dimensional M- theory, the candidate theory about everything.

0374158460|4.0|While I am enjoying this book quite a bit (haven't quite finished it yet), I am not sure that it lives up to it's billing as, possibly, the next great American novel and I can see where other authors may have felt slighted by all of the advance press. That said, I am quite involved with the story and the interdependent characters. I also appreciate how self-referential the characters are and also the references to other authors' styles (i.e., David Foster Wallace, for one). But, it seems that this work could have used some further editing as, often, too much time is spent on a situation and too much description is proffered. It is also not as sophisticated a work as those by some of the authors Franzen references, again, namely David Foster Wallace and sometimes it seems like it was written to become a movie leaving me with the feeling that there was a purposeful effort made to lending the book a commercial bent. But, all in all, Franzen's insights and critique of a slice of American society's shared recent past and the consequences brought the bear on the present are dead on.
0439023513|1.0|I absolutely love the first books and I was totally certain the third would be just as great but I have to say it was overall really disappointing. The worst part for me was the lack of character development, I was expecting anything tragic to happen to any character including Katniss but I never thought she would completely ignore their relationships which were the foundation of the first books. Maybe success ruined it for the author, she started believing she had to write \\"Literature\\", send a big message and somehow forgot to be loyal to her story.    SPOILERS AHEAD!    I guess my major complaints are: Katniss's mother is never \\"real\\" to me, there is not a single scene in this book that makes her alive, differently from CF and in the end she just disappears, doesn't even visit Katniss in recovery. Finninck's death was so gratuitous, they seemed to have time to escape those mutts and he was an excellent survivor, didn't seem realistic to me. The capitol city is full of pods? Why??? The last rebellion was 75 years ago! One of Katniss's best qualities in the arena was her capacity to evaluate her chances. How could she and a bunch of trained soldiers cross an occupied city and invade a well defended mansion to kill the president ??? It was totally absurd to me and this was the whole last third of the book. Prim's death was a big mistake, not because it happened, I was imagining the HG series being what it was, dark and realistic, somebody big was probably going to die in the war. I didn't think it would be Gale or Peeta because that could be a cheap way to save Katniss from choosing one of them and Collins didn't run from tough choices in first books. I was betting on Haymitch or Prim from the beginning. But I thought it would be a sad, well written scene like Rue's death not the insane bombing I didn't fully understand yet. Coin was maybe evil but not crazy, she wouldn't kill lots of children with such a big chance to be discovered. Worse. What was Prim doing over there? A thirteen year old girl still learning the basics? When the war already won? What exactly happened to Johanna? Gale?    And of course, Peeta. He was the ray of sunshine that made the first books feel hopeful despite all the violence. I could have done without that but I wish it had been for a good reason. I understand the choice of his \\"mental confusion\\" when he returned. I always thought he idealized Katniss too much and I as soon as he tried to choke her I thought that would be a great way to develop their relationship and conclude the series. He would slowly come to his senses, become the old Peeta again but finnally see her for what she really was while she would learn to really value his qualities and fight for what they had, what they could have, learning this was what she really needed. This would be \\"the choice\\" that was hinted in the first books, a slow realistic proccess, without an actual \\"choice\\" scene. But that never happens. Katniss mentions she would have chosen him anyway and that she does love him but it is too little too late, by then it seems he only went crazy so she could infuse the book with more suffering and there was no point in it. Not that it has to have a point, I don't mind reading sad stuff, watching sad movies, but they have to be really good and well made otherwise it is just melodrama. Like most people have already said the ending is totally rushed, that is a poor way to end a trilogy. I would have liked to read about them \\"growing back together\\" at least to make up for all the previous mistakes in the book at that point. I really hope in the future I can reread the first books and make up an ending of my own!

0375842209|4.0|It took me three times to get into this book as the author's writing style is different.  However, when I started it the third time, I read nearly 350 pages straight through.  I don't know what was different but this book is definitley different.  I know this is recommended for high school students although I only know a few who would really be able to get into the book.  The reader's guide was helpful and the imagery that Death provides is very provacative.  Unlike make books in the genre of Holocaust/WWII fiction this one touches on the lives of \\"ordinary\\" Germans which makes it worth reading.  I would give it five stars but for the difficulty in getting started.  All I can say is buy the book and don't give up.  There will come a time when it makes sense and then you can't put it down.

B001BKG9SA|4.0|A good representation of what how good David Gilmour and the others are as musicians, however a painful reminder of how much I hate the big outdoor concerts and what Pink Floyd became. It is also well illustrates that David Gilmour is a professional musician and incredily skilled at what he does. Like with Pink Floyd the lighting and effects can at times overshadow the performance and you lose the intimacy between the band and the audience.
0312600844|3.0|\\"freedom\\" disappoints in several ways, and i was looking forward to reading it after the reviews came out. \\"corrections, was fabulous...original, biting, brilliant. \\"freedom\\" is not any of the three.  it is too long on moral, political (rants) and social descriptions and short on believable characters. i had Joey pretty well understood as a selfish, opportunistic jerk, then franzen turns him around. i had walter pretty much understood as a clueless nerd, and then franzen turns \\"him\\" around. many of the characters are complex and could easily grow in stature, but franzen changes the characters into not believable people, seemingly for pseudo creative purposes.    the prose is good, most of the time. however, there should have been editing on a large scale. the novel was loose and flabby.    too bad, i really wanted to like this book.    steve aronoff
B000ELJBAK|3.0|Not really his best work. David was probably more forced into a solo career that necesarily by choice. This was probably more due to the on going internal problems that David headed off in this direction. His contributions to Pink Floyd being enormous. However all four band members almost always work working in a solo fashion with the band as can be seen from there concert movie. Clearly  though all four of them really needed each other abilities. However like most modern bands false pride abition and sheer greed has broken them to pieces. So much for the supposedly high values they espoused. No doubt Pink Floyd falls in this category. However it would take a while I believe for David to hone his skills as a solo artist. Its really only with On A Island that he has achieved the cohesion needed of which this album provides only brief glimpses of.
B001P829VY|5.0|Wonderful transfer of this Huston classic.  Warner comes through on this one with all of the extras ported over from the 2-disc DVD edition--including the 125 minute John Huston biography/career retrospective orginally aired on TBS.  Much happier with the supplements here over those included (or I should say NOT included) on the Blu-Ray of MALTESE FALCON.
B000002UHG|5.0|Truly, this solo album helps one to appreciate the influence Wright had one the sound that came to be Pink Floyd. As far as a solo career is concerned he is not one wo sought the limelight. He was just a solid contributor to the band in writing, vocals and keyboards. As one can readily see he just did not have that ambition to promote himself. It is a shame his only other solo effort is out of print. It would be interesting to make the comparision. However if you do like Pink Floyd you will appreciate this CD it is very solid contrary to other viewpoints. Most Floyd songs would not sound the way they do without his influence. You will like this one.

B000051VWW|3.0|This album didn't tickle my fancy that much unexpectingly. The beats in general on this album are sorta shoddy. The lyrics are mediocre. \\"By Your Side\\" contain lyrics that I would like for my partner to tell me, so they were pretty good. The meaning behind the chorus of \\"Flow\\" are quite confusing. The singing of \\"King of Sorrow\\" is melancholy but noteworthy, yet the lyrics are depressing, and I don't like feeling that way. \\"Somebody Already Broke My Heart\\" shows expectancy of a better significant one. \\"All About Our Love\\" contains lyrics that are too concise. \\"Slave Song\\" has lyrics that are both depressing and confident about raising children. \\"The Sweetest Gift\\" has figurative lyrics showing adornment for someone. \\"Every Word\\" complains about a former romantic one's mistreatment. \\"Immigrant\\" is a story about uncertainty of a male, but has confusing lyrics. \\"Lover's Rock\\" is about a savior who comes to the rescue of negative feelings. \\"It's Only Love That Gets You Through\\" talks to a girl about how she made it through tough times.

B000JVT1U0|5.0|Anthony Shaffer's iconic 1973 classic starring the perfectly-cast Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee (in his best-ever role), Ingrid Pitt and Britt Ekland (overdubbed because she couldn't get her Scottish accent right and body-doubled in her nude scene) is one of the most original independent British films ever made. Little of useful substance can be added to the many excellent reviews of the film posted here without indulging in repetition; but if you're interested in film and have never seen \\"The Wicker Man\\", then you can now experience the full, uncut 100-minute film in its entirety for the first time.<br /><br />Having seen the shortened \\"theatrical\\" version of the film on its cinema release in 1973 paired with Nicholas Roeg's \\"Don't Look Now\\", I had waited many years to see the lost footage. Well, here it is offered on its own disk, as the \\"director's cut.\\" It's definitely the better version, with the initial ten extra minutes showcasing Sergeant Howie's life on the mainland, his chaste and traditional relationship with his fianc&eacute;e (anachronistic even in 1973), religious zeal singing in church, and the quiet mockery of his unassailable Christian faith from police colleagues. Howie opens and reads the fateful letter, addressed specifically to him, from an anonymous Summerislander informing him that Rowan Morrison is missing: this makes the plot development and shocking denouement all the more poignant, as the audience realises it's all been planned and Howie tested by the islanders to ensure he's fully what he appears to be. Other short but important scenes are restored to the middle of the running time, deepening the narrative and making the film more coherent.<br /><br />The restored minutes are of lower image quality than the rest of the film, as the original high-def master was lost forever - suspected to be accidentally discarded by a careless engineer and unintentionally buried beneath the new M3 motorway construction. Roger Corman's personal copy was the only source available for the missing scenes, and you'll be able to tell the restored scenes right away due to the quality difference.<br /><br />The original butchered cinema release version is also included on its own disk, along with some interesting extras including a truly excellent 50-minute documentary narrated with intelligence and insight by respected film critic Mark Kermode. Finally, there's also a separate CD of the soundtrack with all the original film's extraordinarily atmospheric music.<br /><br />Through the decades, this eccentric 1973 masterpiece has gone from strength to strength and found newer audiences who appreciate its originality, iconoclastic theme, witty and realistic script and shocking ending. It's like no other film ever made, and it works brilliantly. This 3-disk set is the best edition we're ever likely to see, and well worth buying.<br /><br />Neil LaBute's abysmal 2007 \\"remake\\", starring Nicholas Cage and departing completely from the original film's delightful nuanced complexity to descend into a hopeless, risible schlock-horror flick, should be avoided at all costs.

Some people say its slow but they always deliver and dont leave things unanswered.   Season 2 closes alot of the questions of season 1 and gives more in the same breath.   Its exiting.  It has the same structure of other shows whereby 1 in 3 eps are overall story related and the others are independant.   i think this is important for shows to survive on network tv,   as shows like Flashfaward, if you miss even one ep, its very hard to catch up.  Super. Cant wait for Season3 to come out

B001MYIXAW|5.0|An important note about the customer ratings/reviews (for those who make their decision to buy or not strictly on the number of 4 and 5 star versus 1 and 2 star ratings)  - the vast majority (> 90%) of 1 and 2 \\"Star\\" ratings are from people who LOVE the movie, but were angry about the poor subtitles of the initial DVD release.  That problem has been fixed, so the actual percentage of very high ratings is actually much higher than appears - which is still very high.    As far as the movie itself - this is a wonderful, almost perfect film!  If all you want in your vampire/horror movies is frantic action and buckets of blood, this is not your movie.   However, if you want a movie where the pacing of the film fits the story perfectly and where the horror (both physical and emotional) is one component in a complex (both heartbreaking and uplifting) story of loneliness and growing up, this is a movie for you.  Special kudos to the acting of the two young leads - both show a range of emotion that most Hollywood \\"stars\\" can only dream about.
B003TML0VO|2.0|Are you kidding me? When I picked this up at the local record store I thought this could be cool. Latin/Rock interpretations of some excellent rock songs. But come on, there is no latin feel at all and I could hardly tell this was Santana except for a few guitar licks. Some of these songs are just plain horrible. How could you have anything worse than this version of Back in Black? Clive Davis needs to retire and Carlos needs some roots oriented producer to bring out the true spirit of his playing which has been missed for many albums now.This may be the worse Santana album I have ever heard.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|While I know this is going to be great, I am a little tired of hearing how bad the last two films are. I don't think their bad at all, not the direction I would have liked, but what do you expect from today's hollywood. Point is true fans not only of the franchise, but of films themselves, appreciate them. I'm no critic, and a movie has to do a lot for me to dislike it, I take things for what they are, and I love this series, ALL OF IT. So I recommend you get it, and let the critics continue to wait forever for the separate release.
B003MX5P20|4.0|Another great CD by Enrique Iglesias.  Even though he has a completely different singing style from his famous father, Julio, Enrique puts the same quality ingredients into his albums:  Great song writers coming up with great songs and a band that is second-to-none to play the musical score.  The only drawback is that, like Julio, Enrique's albums are barely 40 minutes long.  I guess with them it is quality, not quantity.  Better no song, than a mediocre fill-in.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I got the dvd's yesterday, the box was a little damaged but the actual dvd's were in perfect condition, and that's what matters!
B002UXRGLG|4.0|This is another great nature documentary from BBC, along the lines of the famous \\"Planet Earth\\" DVD.  David Attenborough narrates in this version, but beware of another version narrated by Oprah Winfrey as it is more for kiddies.  The filming of the scenes is absolutely awesome!
B0025KVLTM|1.0|This really is an awful album from start to finish. For a start, the title is very misleading. I thought I was buying an album called \\"Beatles\\" by a brass band named \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" only to learn when I got home and played it that it was the opposite!     Then there are the terrible songs, starting with the title track. The best part is the tuning up at the beginning, and then the singer says he's going to introduce us to \\"the one and only Billy Shears\\", but the song ends before we ever get to hear Billy sing. What a disappointment!! \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\" is exactly what Ringo needs to make this song interesting. Not a patch on Joe Cocker's original! Then there is \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\", or LSD in other words. What? A song about pounds, shillings and pence? Give us a break please!! Next is \\"Getting Better\\". No it's not, it's getting worse! \\"Me used to be angry young man. Me hiding me head in the sand\\"? So you should mate, with appalling grammar like that! \\"Fixing A Hole\\" next. Only another 3999 to go then if you're fixing it in Blackburn, Lancashire! \\"She's Leaving Home\\", probably after being given this album as a present by her mum & dad. Give me Billy Bragg's original anytime! \\"Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite\\". What sort of title is that? And \\"The Hendersons will dance and sing\\". Not Dickie Henderson I hope, 'cos he's crap! \\"Within You Without You\\". Er, without you thanks, George. If I want to listen to this kind of music, I'll go to an Indian restaurant! \\"When I'm 64\\". Sounds like you already are, Paul, on this jolly old codger's ditty! \\"Lovely Rita\\". \\"Got the bill and Rita paid it\\"? You tight git!! \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\". Good job there is a cockerel on it. It woke me up!! \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)\\". Still no Billy Shears! Finally, we have \\"A Day In The Life\\". \\"The English Army had just won the war\\". Huh? Don't you know your history John? Everyone knows that the Americans, in it from thestart like the good ol' boys they are, won the war. We only came in after the Japanese bombed Poole Harbour!     Anyway, enough ranting for now. A poor effort by anyone's standards and to be avoided at all costs!

B001IF5YLQ|1.0|If you look at a standard DVI/VGA connector from Apple, you'll see that there are four pins around the \\"horizontal\\" pin off to the side.  If you examine the (blurry) picture of DVI out on this, you'll see that there are no pins around the horizontal.  People are blaming Apple for this (since it doesn't connect to an Apple DVI/VGA connector, but I'm wondering if these aren't actually bootleg/illegal knock-offs.  In any event, if you're thinking of getting mini DisplayPort to DVI and then DVI to VGA (so you have all the flexibility you need), this is NOT the device to get, it won't reconnect to the original Mac DVI/VGA connectors that came with older laptops.  Do not get.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I grew up on Beauty and the Beast... I've seen it at least a half dozen times. But when I sat down and popped this into my Blu-ray player the other night, it felt like the first time. I honestly sat there and thought, \\"I've never seen this movie before.\\" Mainly because, I never had. At times, the characters of Belle, Gaston, the Beast, and Maurice felt like real, breathing individuals. And the hand-drawn backgrounds... Oh my, my, my. Every single leaf, nuanced roof tile, and stone bridge is startlingly clear and rendered in the highest quality imaginable. The soundtrack explodes with vibrancy and rattles the walls with clanging dishes and flatware in \\"Be Our Guest.\\" The by-now legendary ballroom sequence during the title song almost brought me to tears just from the sheer beauty of the image before my eyes! And who ever knew Belle blushed in the film?! I've never once noticed that. Buy this today! This very minute! It is the highlight of my Blu-ray collection and I cannot wait to see the stellar Lion King on Blu-ray next fall! Kudos Disney, huge kudos!!!

I love that their is someone who makes me look frugal and I so understand how it is to have your mom watch and spoil your child then unsure how they got that way.

B003PIUC02|2.0|I have no idea why this is getting so many high votes. i saw a review on Rome, the complete series and the guy said he didn't like it because of all the pornography. Well, if that is the case, stay away from this series. they go from one scene of sex to a scene of gutting someone or cutting a head/legs/face off.<br /><br /> i have seen only disk one at the time i write this and yet i am complelled to not watch the rest. there is no story per sey execpt the \\"hard life of a gladiator\\".  I know the story of spartocus and was hoping to see some of the history surrounding the story. what i get is another roman history lesson on \\"what could have happened back then\\" and no story of the man the series is named after.<br /><br />If roman vice is your vice then by all means order this. there is pleanty of vice to keep you going for a long time. If story and history matter then maybe you should not view this. Unless the next couple of disks get any better i won't be ordering the second season<br /><br />and by the way, who wrote the script for this \\"boody\\" show? shakespear?

B0036EH3XE|5.0|My husband and I have been so anxious, but have waited patiently for the 6th and Final Season of Lost to be released.  We pre-ordered for an awesome deal and received it within a few days of the Finale release.  It was well worth the wait!  Our seller was fast and efficient!  Even though our shipment was estimated around a week or so, it arrived ASAP as though we requested 1st class Priority mail!  Definitely a fantastic seller!
1439190275|5.0|This book is not a joke, it is not a lie. I have lied 80 lbs and I am going down, day by day with this diet. It has literally saved my life.    There is not much more someone can say that that.    This is not a advertisement, in that I am paid or I know anyone or will gain anything from Atkins productions.     For all I care, they are a business. And they want profit. But for once, the product is real and it is EFFECTIVE.    I can only say that if you have any type of diabetes or problem with your weight. Then please do yourself a favour and stop paying doctors an insane amount of money and get this book.     I would also make sure your cholesterol is good and if you can walk at least ten minutes a day. Brisk walk that is.

0446310786|4.0|The book To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, is a novel that discusses racist topics, and world problems. Jean Louise Finch (Scout), her brother Jem, and their friend Dill experience many tough situations to learn from that they don't understand as kids, but as they get a little older their dad explains it and it makes sense to them. The kids, along with many others are faced with racism throughout the book and it has a major impact on their lives.    I enjoyed the way Harper Lee wrote most of the book. She used outstanding details and imagery to describe the characters and scenes. I found the way she wrote the courtroom scene very detailed. I could feel the intense emotions flying back and forth between Atticus and Mr. Gilmer as they argued the facts of Tom Robinson's case. Mrs. Lee showed both, Atticus' and Mr. Gilmer's personalities with that one scene alone by how she described their facial expressions and emotions. It showed how calm Atticus is, opposed to how angry, and determined to defeat Atticus Mr. Gilmer is. Most of the novel was very strong.   The book started off a little slow and gradually got more exciting. The author took a while to introduce the characters and their personalities. It took me some time to get in to the book before it pulled me in. The author spent a lot of time on the introduction to make sure she thoroughly described the setting and characters to make it clear to the reader what was going on. Once I got in to the plot I realized that the introduction was extremely helpful to the reader.   This book tells a terrific story along with showing real life problems. It was a fun book that I would recommend to all readers.
B000F9RMHK|5.0|I just recently watched this movie for the first time in my life and loved it. If you are a fan of creepy mind benders you will love it. I have read in several other reviews that the die hards didn't like the directors cut because it changed some of the plot in the movie from the original but I own several directors cut versions of films and like them better because you get more of the story as the director intended. As for the fact that this one came with a collectable tin, plus I got the limited edition Hot Topic version, so I got a necklace with Frank the demented bunny as the pendant; that was just the cherry on top. I  highly recomend this version to anyone who isn't a theatrical version purist and likes to get a little bling with their Darko...

B002ZCY7PU|4.0|We have been Chuck fans from the first season.  We enjoy the premise and the shows are fun to watch.  The actors do a good job of making the characters likeable/interesting.  Season 3 has the usual wandering around the relationship with Chuck and Sarah, but the final few episodes are better when they finally make a commitment to be together.  However, it gets somewhat irritating when they aren't honest with each other within that relationship.  We'll be interested to see how they handle the relationship in season 4.

0312600844|1.0|This book is the puzzlement of the year.   Overlong and overpraised, this story of yet another dysfunctional American family is written in a kind of flat mid-western prose larded over  with the   demotic  to give it currency. The thin story of the disintegration and re-constitution of a marriage is stretched over nearly 600 pages that I could not wait to end.   The characters are described, psychoanalyzed, sliced and diced expertly -- and stubbornly refuse to come to life.  The effect is like watching a movie from the wrong end of a telescope.  Moments that you take as satire  turn out to be deadly serious.   And, incredibly,  it all turns out happily for all but one character.    They all \\"go to the seashore\\" .  What is all the literary fuss about?

B003Y8YXGC|5.0|Was the Nutopian National Anthem really remastered as stated?  Count me as skeptical... I'm not a trained musician, but  I hear absolutely NO appreciable difference between any previous issues of this song!  Can't believe they would charge 99 cents to download it.  Talk about paying for nothing!  Buyer Beware... There just may be something kind of funny about that though if some poor soul unknowingly pays a dollar for 4 seconds of silence....      Seriously though, this is a  great John Lennon album with one big hit (Mind Games) and some lesser known gems tending towards the softer, mellower. love songs like Out the Blue, I Know, I'm Sorry.  Very personal and heartfelt like so much of Lennon's work.  One of my favorites.
B003XL6EKS|4.0|What is it with the negative mentality from fans when a lead singer goes solo? I am glad I grew up during a different era when it was just fine for a lead singer to go solo with fans. For example, Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins, David Lee Roth, Peter Cetera, Jon Anderson, etc., etc. Nowadays it seems there's this negative element involved for no really good reason.<br /><br />Brandon Flowers of The Killers releases his first solo album and it's, \\"This isn't what I expected\\" or \\"This is another Killers album\\" or \\"The fans who give this positive reviews are deluded\\", etc., etc. The fact of the matter is The Killers are popular right now, \\"Flamingo\\" entered the Billboard Top 200 Albums Chart in the top ten, the first single \\"Crossfire\\" has done well on the charts.<br /><br />Also, Flowers brings in the heavy artillery with three great producers: Stuart Price (New Order, Madonna, Scissor Sisters, Pet Shop Boys, Gwen Stefani, Seal and Keane), Daniel Lanois (U2, Peter Gabriel and Robbie Robertson) and Brendan O'Brien (Stone Temple Pilots, Pearl Jam, Rage Against The Machine, Korn, The Offspring, Train, Bruce Springsteen, Incubus, The Music, The Wallflowers, Audioslave, The Bravery, Velvet Revolver and AC/DC). This has ensured a quality product. Plus a duet with Riley Kilo's lead singer Jenny Lewis on \\"Hard Enough\\".<br /><br />I listened to all three Killers albums in sequential order prior to listening to \\"Flamingo\\", and I have to say I liked \\"Flamingo\\" slightly more than The Killers albums. This is the first album where I felt there was a musical unity throughout. I did not feel, upon repeated listening, that there were any weak tracks here. Some are better than others, but overall the album sounded good, not great. Flowers (and The Killers) still have the potential to develop into a classic rock band, but they have yet to hit their stride.<br /><br />Growing up in the 1980's, this album reminded me of many other artists/bands from that era with a modern polish, and The Killers are, after all, a retro band, a post-new wave revival band. Flowers' influences are also from that era, and they are evident here.<br /><br />\\"Welcome To Fabulous Las Vegas\\" is a great, grand, sweeping opener. \\"Only The Young\\", the album's second single, is a beautifully sung, electronic ballad. \\"Hard Enough\\" has a country tinge with a carefully placed hook in the chorus. \\"Jilted Lovers & Broken Hearts\\" is the most Killers sounding track and one of the fastest paced tracks here. \\"Playing With Fire\\" might be the weakest track here, but it redeems itself in its melody line during the second half of the song. \\"Was It Something I Said?\\" has a good melody. \\"Magdalena\\" is pure vocal hook magic. \\"Crossfire\\" is likewise catchy and melodic. \\"On The Floor\\" and \\"Swallow It\\" finish off the original 10 track album with more hooks. The four bonus tracks are equally as good with \\"The Clock Was Tickin'\\" and \\"Jacksonville\\" being very catchy.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Flamingo\\" deserves four stars for its great production and hooks galore. Anyone can quibble over the lyrical content here, and many have complained about the religious content, but I inspected the lyrics online and did not feel Flowers was being overly preachy. I mean give me a break here. There are so many other artists that are absolutely preachy in their convictions, and who cares? That's what's great about popular music--passion, conviction, opinions, points of view, attitudes. People are so easily perturbed by the smallest things.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Flamingo\\" compares to The Killers:<br /><br />2004 Hot Fuss: Four Stars<br />2006 Sam's Town: Three and a Half Stars<br />2008 Day & Age: Three and a Half Stars<br />2010 Flamingo: Four Stars (from a biased, non-zealous fan)d, a post-new wave revival band.

B0043JDUNS|3.0|It was ok, but I expected a lot more from it just based on the first Iron Man that came out in the movies not long ago.  This one was very slow up until a little more than half way through the movie, and then it became a little more exciting, but in small spurts, and overall was still a little slow.
B002JVWQT6|5.0|24 Episodes on 3 Blu-Ray discs, released September 21, 2010<br /><br />One of the new shows that got the most buzz last year was \\"Modern Family\\" created by Steven Levitan and Christopher Lloyd (No, not the actor OR the Indiana Film critic, but the producer/writer). It tells the story of three very different modern families all related going about their day-to-day lives and challenges.<br /><br />The first family is Jay Pritchett played by Ed O'Neill & Gloria Delgado-Pritchett played by Sof&iacute;a Vergara and her son, Manny Delgado played by Rico Rodriguez. Jay owns his own business and is an older, successful man who got divorced (with good reason since in an early episode, you get to see how crazy she was) and miraculously bagged Gloria, a vivacious, beautiful divorcee from Columbia. Jay is stubborn and stuck in his ways and Gloria is a free spirit always expressing emotion and encouraging her son basically to sprout wings and fly his own course by his heart. Sof&iacute;a Vergara is a newer actress but manages to create a character so lovable with many authentic qualities that keep her from being a stereotype. Manny is one of the most mature 10 year olds you will ever meet and is very proud of his heritage and wears his heart on his sleeve trying to write poetry for girls which Jay tries to discourage. Rico Rodriguez is a scene stealer and the most fun to watch of all the kids on the show.<br /><br />The second family is the most nuclear of the show with Jay's daughter, Claire Dunphy played by Julie Bowen and her husband, Phil played by Ty Burrell. Claire is a stay-at-home mom who at first comes off as the most normal character in the entire show, but eventually her obsessive-compulsive perfectionism and a few other well-placed come into play explaining why she's in this family to begin with. Ty Burrell walks the line with this character that is such a fool believing he's a cool dad, husband, realtor, anything he attempts with enough realism that you feel like you've met this person in your life. The kids here are type characters, but still very funny. First there's the pretty one with the older boyfriend in a band, Haley played by Sarah Hyland. Then there's the smart one that likes to instigate situations, Alex played by Ariel Winter. Finally there's the dim-witted youngest child that can't keep his pants on and runs into doors, Luke played by Nolan Gould.<br /><br />The third family is made up of Claire's brother, Mitchell Pritchett played by Jesse Tyler Ferguson and his partner, Cameron Tucker played by Eric Stonestreet who have just adopted a little Vietnamese baby girl, Lilly (played by twins Ella and Jaden Hiller). Mitchell is a lawyer who is overprotective, always worried about the baby's progress and has a quick temper letting every little comment get to him escalating into big fights with his family. Cameron is the more flamboyant of the two and is a nurturer, loves to dress up as a clown, dance, sing, and is a stay-at-home dad.<br /><br />All of the couples have great on screen chemistry together, particularly in the interview segments. It's amazing that we as a culture are totally used to this format of television show now where not only are characters acting out stories, but they occasionally come and break the fourth wall talking to a camera as if answering questions and giving life advice. It's almost like Shakespearean \\"asides\\" in a way if you think about it to get into the mind of the character more than ever before. Do we know why anyone is interviewing them? No, and we no longer care to ask.<br /><br />The writing on this show is fantastic and after watching some of the bonus features, it seems some of the situations were taken from real-life situations prover life can be stranger than fiction once again. The plots are hilarious and these characters breathe so much energy into them, I almost dare you not to crack up at them. My favorite characters are Phil and Gloria because he is such an idiot that doesn't know it, I'd almost compare him to Michael Scott from \\"The Office\\" and she is such a passionate woman who doesn't let anyone walk all over her and expresses herself so well. In the pilot episode, you might mistakenly look at her as a gold-digging trophy wife without a brain cell in her body, but she swears the pants in that family more than Jay will ever figure out.<br /><br />Let's let the awards do the talking for a moment. It has been nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Television Series Musical or Comedy. It also won 6 Emmys (Casting, Comedy Series, Editing, Sound Mixing, Supporting Actor Eric Stonestreet, Writing) and was nominated for another 8 (Art Direction, Directing, Guest Star Fred Willard, Editing, Supporting Actor Ty Burrell, Supporting Actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Supporting Actor Julie Bowen, Supporting Actor Sof&iacute;a Vergara). That is amazing! I don't remember EVER seeing so many actors nominated from a single series in its first year so one win out of five nominations ain't bad considering how impressive it is for so many from one show to be picked in the first place. I highly recommend checking this show out, it is very funny and family-oriented.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />\\"Before Modern Family\\" tells the tale of what projects (if any) the actors worked on before coming to the show and how they found out about it and shows some clips of their screen tests. \\"Real Modern Family Moments\\" is a fun little featurette where the writers sit down and confess the truthiness (yes, I'm using that word) of some of the stories written into the show like dressing up for the firemen, the pigeon getting stuck in the house, and finding weird things under the house after a repairman came to visit to name a few.<br /><br />The deleted interview segments and extended/alternate scenes make you wish the show could be shown commercial-free to include them all since they are all pretty funny material. Modern Family \\"Hawaii\\" and \\"Family Portrait\\" go behind the scenes of those episodes talking about how fun it was to travel to Hawaii for work and getting the light correct as well as the final episode of the season.

6305081751|5.0|I first saw this movie (the original) when I was in highschool, and the theme of wanting to 'fit in' really resonated.  Even 25 years later, it can still make me cry, and I watch it anyway, because this movie helps me to remember that life is comprised of both bad and good.  To paraphrase: \\"when there are bad times; remember the good times\\".  Cheers.
B003Q6D2A0|5.0|Gina from HauntedFlower.com reviews \\"Never Let Me Go\\" based on a book called one of the best of the decade and starring Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield, and Kiera Knightley in a pretty amazing story of three young people living on borrowed time.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />The Secrets of Never Let Me Go is the main bonus feature on the DVD as a making-of introducing the author of the book, the screenplay adapter, the director, and how members of the cast all came together to make the film. They discuss their common goals and intentions with the film, the muted color palette, the talent of the young British actors, and the author attempts to answer some common questions about the story like \\"Why don't the donors just run away?\\", etc.<br /><br />There is no shortage of images in these bonus features -- you can view Mark Romanek's on-set photography, stills of Tommy's Art, and National Donor Programme & Hailsham Graphics urging donors to maintain a healthy heart and body and asking for better care and future for the donors from the public. And, of course, there's a trailer.
B001IBIQU6|1.0|Like many of the reviewers on here, i too have been a huge fan of depeche mode, for most of my life and most of their career. They were introduced to me in 1984, and immediately set about buying everything that i could by them. mostly from \\"some great reward\\" on i had gotten every single that they had released and every album. I have seen them twice in concert, mainly because the two experiences were so amazing i did not want them all to blur together, instead keeping them remaining as special events in my life instead. I had learned every song, learned how to sing from dave gahans influence, and listened to each song to get me through the best parts of life, and the most low of them as well. I will not ramble any further about being influenced by them, but i think you get the point, that i am not just some random guy that owns the most popular but not necessarily the best albums of an artists discography \\"pink floyds, the wall\\" \\"ac/dcs back in black\\" \\"nirvana's never mind\\" and \\"depeche modes violator\\" respectably.     since their inception every dm album has had its fair share of moments, from the boyish, disco tech synth pop of speak and spell, to the ambient, darkness of violator. i have my favorites, but with the light always comes dark, and also have my moments of dissatisfaction. Even songs of faith and devotion was awkward at first listen, although i feel they broke the mold with that album, and holds up well today, even if regarded as a huge departure from violator. To say the least, i feel my least favorite album though of the depeche catalog is in fact exciter, which i certainly after first listen was not exactly excited about it. i do have a particular few songs on there that i did enjoy but felt it was a weak album after ultra, which i regard very high in terms of what they had to go through during that period of time. but now... it seems that exciter finally has some competition, with \\"sounds of the universe.\\" simply put, if this is indeed what the sounds of the universe are, i feel that they could have been more successful just recording a toilet flushing.    the problem i feel is that the album is layered so much that it ultimately loses what might have been. the songs feel rushed, the lyrics are less than inspiring, and really there is only one song that i can thoroughly listen to, \\"wrong\\" which just happened to be the first single... coincidence or fear of the studio? it is the strongest entry and many of the songs overdubs, and reverb of gahans voice does not do someone justice when you have a great voice to begin with. writing this review though i feel a sense of betrayal of writing anything bad on the band, but feel that this worthy enough to do so. Here the album came out almost two years ago, and here it is the only album that i am missing from my depeche collection. i felt that with playing the angel, they had come back in a big way after exciter and hoped they would continue that trend, but unfortunately they did not. i dont think that they are at the end though, but i certainly hope the next entry is much stronger than this.

0316098337|2.0|I find myself in the minority of those who found Room to be superlative. It is unique given the fact that it's written from the perspective of Jack, but other than that it left me wondering about all the applause it's been receiving. I found the first third to be tedious and monotonous in the constant repetition of Jack and Ma's daily life. The character of Old Nick was never really developed. The \\"change in their circumstances\\" (afraid to reveal any spoilers here, since others have been severely castigated for their divulgement of the plot line)provided an upswing in the monotony, thankfully. The denouement was what could have been expected!  I've read Slammerkin and The Sealed Letter by this author and those two books were much more deserving of praise.  My advice is to get it from the library.
B0043ZDFEQ|4.0|This is an enjoyable album.  Has a real 80's sound to me.  Very easy to listen to and enjoy.  Simple melodies and nice singing.  Real pop music.<br />[[ASIN:B000297VQA Voice Lessons To Go Volume 1: Vocalize and Breath]]
1603425381|5.0|Oh so good source for all your edging needs. Instructions both written and charted. Awesome book. So many lovely edgings to choose from. I also like that the rows are in different colors so you can see where you are. I think they are lovely this way. Really good color choices as well, and I'm picky about that. I won't invest in a reference if I think the colors are awful. And while I love when books like these are spiral bound so they'll lay flat, the landscape format of this book allows it to do just that. Nicely thought out and executed.

B000063UR2|5.0|you cannot beat the original version of this film (with tangerine dream st)it makes this film so magical, it takes you away. however the re-vamped version isnt so great. sorry but jerry goldsmiths background music totally killed it. definatly worth every penny-takes me back to my childhood, and my kids love it. a real family fantasy adventure. 5 *
B00164GDD2|4.0|Ghostbusters is a truly classic movie.  It's the greatest cinematic acheivement of Akroyd, Hudson, and Ramis' career, in my opinion.  I'd throw Bill Murray in there, but he DID get an Oscar nomination for \\"Lost in Translation\\".  If you haven't seen this movie yet, drive as fast as you legally can to the nearest place that sells DVD's, videos, betamax, or whatever, buy this movie, watch it, and if you don't enjoy it, you have also automatically revoked your right to enjoy baseball, apple pie, and fireworks.<br /><br />That said, with the exception of a piece on the restoration of the Ectomobile, there's not a whole lot in the Blu-ray that's new.  And actually, there's some content that was on the DVDs that's missing in the Blu-ray version.  So, if I were to recommend which version of this movie to get, I'd say get the widescreen on DVD, and if you have a bluray player that does a decent job of upscaling, you won't notice much of a difference in the overall appearance of the movie.  When it's done right, and you go back to the original film reels, you can make old movies look great even if they weren't shot in HD, but in this case, I think they did just enough to clean this up so they could make a few extra bucks selling the anniversary release as a bluray.  It doesn't seem like the same kind of love that has gone into other re-releases went into this bluray.<br /><br />Unless you're a collector, I'd say just get the DVD and save yourself $10-20 bucks.
0439023483|5.0|Wow. I was absolutely blown away with this book. I could not put it down -- literally; I read the whole novel in one sitting.    Collins successfully draws out the most human elements in every situation portrayed in the book. Everything comes across easily and vividly. The characters, setting, story, message -- every facet of the work is magnificent.    Though not an arduous read (and I was at first skeptical because of how easily I breezed through the pages), The Hunger Games is an engrossing tale wrapped around a profound commentary about society.    I highly suggest picking up this book.    PS The hardcover has a beautiful embossing of a mockingjay on the front, which was a nice surprised. I am a big fan of fine-looking books.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Mama Mia is sure to become a classic musical.  It's fun and romantic.  The musical scores and dance routines are outstanding.  My 11 and 15-year olds are still singing songs around the house from the movie.
B003K07DUC|4.0|The Green Zone with Matt Damon provided me exactly what I was looking for, a good action flick. The political commentary is a bit over the top, but if you're inclined to believe conspiracies about the intelligence and political failures that got the United States into Iraq, it's somewhat believable.     The story is about Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller who is in charge of a U.S. Army team that is supposed to find WMD's in Iraq. However Miller's team not only keeps coming up empty, his team is sent in to places that obviously have not held WMD's for several years, or never had WMD's their in the first place. Miller begins to question the intelligence that he and his team have been given about their targets. Miller befriends a CIA agent Martin Brown, played very well by Brendan Gleeson, who tells him that he's on a wild goose chase. Miller then gets in the middle of a political war between Brown and a character that is obviously supposed to be Paul Bremer, by the name of Clark Poundstone, played well by Greg Kinnear. Brown and Miller set out on a hunt for the individual who is allegedly the source of American intel about WMD, General Mohammad Al-Rawi. If Brown and Miller can locate him, Brown believes Al-Rawi will be able to expose the fact there are no WMD's in Iraq and also be a contact with the Iraqi Army and prevent an insurgency.     Many elements of this movie do ring true and several real life individuals, including Bremer and Ahmed Chalabi are obviously portrayed with fictionalized names in this movie. It's a tribute to writer Brian Helgeland and director Paul Greengrass that they were able to stay somewhat close to what journalist Rajiv Chandrasekaran wrote about the Green Zone and the American administration of Iraq in his book Imperial Life in the Emerald City and yet create a great thriller movie.     Unlike other reviewers I didn't have a problem with the hand held cameras, mostly I think because I'm used to them. I found this movie to be far more interesting and watchable than The Hurt Locker. I watched this movie on rental from Amazon. The process to download it to my computer for viewing was quite simple and the quality very good.
B00006ADFL|4.0|Absolutely shocking, very bold piece of cinema. I didn't expect much from the film initially but on the very first view, I was left amazed, totally in awe as the film had completely taken me back to the 1950's when the really sad incident took place. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey deliver a satisfying performance, their chemistry is dazzling to witness on screen, the rest of the cast do a very remarkable work. The fact that the film is based on a true story had me thinking twice. 'Heavenly Creatures' shines with good character study, cast-performance and direction and most of us make us all witness two teenage girls in a real dramatic and thrilling journey of their life, leading to shocking consequences. Worth a watch.
0525951652|5.0|I am truly surprised that there are so few 5 star ratings and so many 1 star. This is a magnificient book, well researched and written. The characters are interesting and you get really involved in their lives as soon as they are introduced. I have read 720 pages thus far and would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves historical novels. Thank you, Mr. Follett, for so many hours of reading enjoyment, I hate to see this book end and I anxiously await the next two books in this trilogy.    By the way, it is unfair to give this book a 1 star rating based on the price charged for the digital version, very unfair to the author.
B003HC8I5M|3.0|This is no surprise that Phil Collins came out with an 60's motown oriented album.  Songs in the past such as \\"Two Hearts\\" & \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\", should've indicated a motown album in the future.    Even in Genesis Invisible Touch Tour he did a whole R&B medley in the end on the concert.  This album is a labour of love, and has been recorded in meticulous detail to recreate the 60's vibe.  Even getting the original session players like the funk bros. shows the seriousness of this album.  It has  a lot of good tunes, and even some obscure ones that you don't hear a lot of other artists cover.  In the end I felt a bit empty, and I felt it was time for Phil Collins to move forward.  In his interview he stated that he really hoped that people see him in his true light rather than the singer/songwriter he is known for with songs such as \\"One More Night.\\"  The problem is that Phil Collins is known for his unique style and always will be.  It's just when it comes to recreating motown I feel that their are other artists such as Michael McDonald who did more of a interesting job than PC.  I would've rather liked for PC to do a motown album that was stylistically different, rather than adhearing to the original recordings.  Songs like Stevie Wonders' \\"Blame It On The Sun\\" is a daring road that PC took.  Phil does not sound like himself vocally, but that is the criticism you get when you try to replicate everything faithfully.  If the instrumental version sounds close to the original, than you are going to be judged vocally like those artist that recorded these songs such as The Temptations, The Four Tops, Smokey Robinson, etc,.  It's not like Phil does not sing good on this album.   It's actually the opposite, but PC's voice does not fit for an R&B project of this manner.  Even when D'Angelo covered Smokey Robinson he put his own original spin to it.  If you a PC fan, and you love 60's Motown than this album is a match made in heaven.  As for me I'll wait till PC self indulgence phase is over, and comes back with some original material.
B000W9DTG6|4.0|I don't have the Trilogy but want to add my review:  Oceans 11...I have both on DVD and VHS and played them on a regular basis...like four nights a week...Excellent movie enjoying the last 15 minutes.However I wondered why Don Cheadle's name wasn't listed on the end-cast credits ?...hmmm.  Ocean's 12... I never got into it.I  could never watch its entirety on television...not a good sequel.When first seeing it I wonder what (the production) had done to it ??  Ocean's 13...Now we see the rough side of Danny & Co.  Great performance by Al Pacino.  I didn't like the music...too digital,nothing like the Ocean's 11(2001).Still enjoy watching it.    All & all the Trilogy is worth it.
1416550550|2.0|That it took me a week to read this books is very telling.  This was a hard book to read and I'll try to be very clear as to why.<br /><br />First, the authoress ;) is very good in her craft in the sense that the writing itself is well done.  And if that was all it took for me to enjoy a book she would have received five stars from me.<br /><br />However, it takes more than a well written tale for me to fully enjoy the book.  First I have to like the characters and let me say, most of the characters were not likeable.  From Nell who squandered a gift, to her parents, and the cast of characters we found in England.  They were all despicable people, with a very few exceptions, and more than that there was a level of stupidity beginning with Nell that was almost impossible to bear.<br /><br />I also felt the story was purposely and needlessly drawn out.  Several chapters before the end you have the whole \\"mystery\\" figured out so that its anti-climatic when it is finally revealed.  I personally don't appreciate such manipulations.  I would rather get through the book than draw it out an unnecessary 100 pages.<br /><br />I could have done without the fairy tales, but if I'm honest I was so frustrated after the first 100 pages that there was little this book could have done to redeem itself.  To me this was a tale about stupid people who made stupid and selfish choices and made everyone around them suffer for their stupidity and selfishness.  If I want that kind of tale I'll go read the minutes from Congress.
B003YBNREI|4.0|There's a lot of hype concerning this album, and as many reviewers have already stated, a return to form.  Not seeing that here, to be honest.  If you're going to say a return to form as in 'Stampede' and 'What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits', I think this album doesn't quite measure up.  Undoubtedly, this is a good rock album and hearkens closer to 'Brotherhood', 'Cycles', and 'Sibling Rivalry'.  I'll be the outcast here along with others and say that this is a good album, but not a five star one.  For today, maybe it is a five star compared to other albums and only because it's been such a long time since their last release, but it doesn't compare, at all, to the Vices album.  I'm still enjoying this album and am glad they released new material, but could have done without McDonald tagging along although the track does resemble a flashback to the 'Takin' It to the Streets' album.  While it is probably unfair to compare to early releases because when you, or I, do that, any album will never measure up.  So, rate this based solely on the album itself and it does deserve the four star rating, but it will never compare to the Vices album, at all.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I'll be borrowing this one from the library before I'll pay more for the e book version than the hard cover.
B003TVMIDO|3.0|What was missing?  Prior reviews have mentioned Life With the Lions, The Wedding Album-honestly who in their right mind could listen to those then or now.  Sorry Yoko!  Where is Live Peace in Toronto, where is Live in New York City?, where is Menlove Avenue?  Where is Stripped Down?  Next, why is the box so enormous with so little in it?  From a marketing standpoint why in the world don't you have his picture on the box so that when people walk through the store they might be able to identify what it is.  At Costco, which has a very good price by the way, if you didn't know about it you would have walked right by a stack of white boxes that weren't identified.  Finally, what might be a worthwhile project to pursue would be more stripped down versions of other Lennon albums, all which suffer from very muddy mixes.  It would be wonderful to hear his voice unadorned and clear as it is in the stripped down Double Fantasy.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie, it was very entertaining, funny and full of action. I cant wait to have it in my collection! If you haven't seen this movie you definitely missed a very fun time. It was fantastic to finally see Danny Trejo leading a movie...oh and not dying (lol). This is a very worth buying DVD. The other reviews already explained the plot, but when you actually watch it you will realized it is much better...
B00006I53S|4.0|The Lens functions as one would expect from a Canon product, althought don't expect it to be of \\"L Lens\\" quality. Focus is smooth and fast, seems great at all focal lenghths.  Perhaps it is my lack of experience with lenses in this weight class,it is heavy and you have to expect the portability of this lens as an issue for vaction photography.

1596912863|4.0|Who hasn't wanted to spend a fortnight reveling in Jane Austen's world?  All the delight and whimsy of the regency, with indoor plumbing still readily available?  I know I wouldn't turn it down!  This book makes it easy to step (with Jane) into a holiday like one you've never before had.  I found the whole thing utterly charming and entirely readable.  I think I devoured the book in one short evening, and I would be more than happy to read it again!
B003ZK58WM|5.0|Awesome book. I love his historical novels, and this one was no different. I really lets you know just what a travesty war is and how awefull the difference in classes was and still is, though I think we have come a long way from where we were during this time period. Ken Follett novels are anything but boring.
0316067938|2.0|I have very mixed feeling about the Twilight saga. On the one hand, I think it gives a poor example to young girls about expectations and boundaries in relationships... on the other, it's pure fantasy fluff that I can't stop reading in the same way that I can't stop eating cotton candy when it's in front of me.<br /><br />Given this background, I was skeptical going into Breaking Dawn.<br /><br />However, as I read, I was pleasantly surprised at the plot that was being built. The tension between the Volturi and the Cullens over Renesmee could have culminated into a story that showed how Bella's choices had consequences.<br /><br />But Bella and consequences never meet. Anything she touches ends up perfect. She never has to deal with newborn difficulties, whether her own as a vampire, or her daughter's as an actual infant. Everything works out perfectly for her in the end, no matter the stupid decisions she's made along the way. She gets her perfect ending, and loses nothing in the process.<br /><br />And that is what pushes the whole thing past fantasy and into absurdity.
0316069884|1.0|If someone truly cares about the dismal treatment of animals raised for food, here's an infallible solution: Not Eating Animals.<br /><br />Apparently, this thought was way too heterodox or self-defeating for the author's palate or for the book's publishers to handle.  Instead, we are deigned an equally abysmal option of so-called \\"humane\\" farms which, at best, can only satisfy the needs of an elite niche.<br /><br />The preposterous use (read abuse) of animals driven by the demand created by the vast remainder of the masses remains unaddressed and unchallenged, and thus, by default, maintains the status quo.
0547258305|4.0|On the whole, I liked this book a lot. The people were well-written and true to their characters. The story was told in an interesting and engaging way, and I loved the Graces as a form of magic. To see that people could have a gift- something that could be summed up in one word while still touching on more than one aspect of their life... it was a nice take on traditional magics.<br /><br />However... I will say I'm a little over this trend in young adult fantasy to make the female main character so anti-marriage and -children. It's like the books are pushing independence so hard that they can't see that wanting marriage and kids is a valid choice itself. That frustrates me.

B000F3UAFC|4.0|Helen Hunt was very good! The entire cast was superb. There was so much insights on the movie quotes, love it!
0679735909|3.0|It seems odd that I have less to say about this book than I generally do about my readings.  I'll confess to skipping much of the poetry...I did read the letters and journals etc (and they are fundamental to the plot) but I've never been able to become much of a poetry gal (though I've tried).  The story is readable and understandable w/o the poems...though I'm sure they add an element that I missed...but I'm pretty okay with that.    This is a truly literary novel.  I've read several literary mysteries and this one is the most focused on the written word and the romance plot is less subjugated to the mystery than in other novels I've encountered.  It is a journey, for both the modern days literary analysts and for the subjects of their intense study.      I did enjoy the story and some of the thoughts on the nature of language.  I did LIKE the book.  But I wanted to like it more...felt like I \\"should\\" like it more.  It held my attention, but I was ready for it to end...to me, that keeps it from being a top-notch tale since with those I find myself slowing my progress to \\"stay\\" with the characters and tale.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|A good movie, but prefer other Jane Austin's adaptations, eventhough this is one of the most talked about ones. I would not mind seen this movie with a different cast. This is not to put down this cast, but something was missing for me when it related to the chemistry.
B002VPE1XE|4.0|I have an older Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 and it's one of those \\"in-between\\" cameras that's not huge and bulky but also not credit card skinny. For this particular camera, the AmazonBasics FF Camera case proved to be a little too wide for a comfortable fit. The camera had a good 3/4 to an inch of space within the main compartment with the camera inside, which lead to a bit of movement while stored. With the width, I'm not really too sure what the ideal camera for this case is - my larger DSLR obviously didn't fit (and even if it did, where would you put the lenses?) The size of the case also made it too cumbersome to work as a \\"slip into your purse/backpack\\" pack-away case.<br /><br />All of that being said, for ~$8, it's not a bad case. The padding is pretty substantial and would easily protect your camera from the everyday bumps and scrapes. Drop your camera a lot?  Well you might want something a little more padded. The velcro-only flap does cause a bit of concern for the overall security of your camera - I would feel a lot better if there was a zipper.
B002S8AH00|4.0|A classic by its own right, with a legend behind it, Heath Ledger! May he rest in peace.
0439023491|4.0|It seems that, with trilogies, there's often a bit of a slump with the middle book.  The plot's not tight enough or the pace is too slow or it comes off as little more than a placeholder intended to make more money for the publisher.  I was pleased to find that this was not the case with Catching Fire.<br /><br />While I didn't think this book was quite as good as The Hunger Games, it did move the overall story along and set us up for the events of the final book in the series.  I like the developing love triangle (with two decent guys... what a novel idea!) and I'm anxious to find out what happens to Katniss and her friends next.<br /><br />If you liked The Hunger Games, you'll probably like Catching Fire as well.  I highly recommend it for fans of YA dystopian fiction.
B000001GQD|5.0|I'm about half way into movement 2 of the Rachmaninov.  Moved to tears.  I heard Lang Lang butcher Rach 3 live in concert with the MN Orchestra, and Pogorelich a few years earlier...  Well, let's just say there was not a dull moment.  This is pure artistry.  I agree with the superlatives in others' reviews and I have no special insights.  This music can be trite and treacly in the hands of any number of talented and well meaning schlock meisters on the concert circuit.  It's not just the subtlety RIchter brings but he does so (amazingly enough) while pumping out every emotion embedded in the music.  Incidentally, the hopelessly out of print CBS/Lazar Berman version which I also own is close to being on the same plane.

B003TVMIDO|4.0|The thing about the Stripped Down Double Fantasy release not being in this box is that if you look at the pictures up above and enlarge them, looking down the spine of the disc, Stripped Down is there. So apparently it was going to be in it at one point.    I had to get this for the rare tracks. Now I'm going back and getting the remixes from the 2000's. I bought Double Fantasy and Milk and Honey when they came out but somehow missed the others. I'm most curious about Mind Games. I always thought the sound was off on that one. One big difference I hear from the new masters over the original CD releases is Meat City sounds a little punchier.     As I said, I bought the box for the rare tracks. The Plastic Ono songs sounds like stripped down versions of the proper songs instead of demos and alt takes like you would expect. Honey Don't sounds like a finished track as well. You have to wonder why One of the Boys and India, India weren't given to the Threatles to finish. There's another version of I'm the Greatest that I keep hoping for. There's definitely enough material for another box set of alternate material, if it's just the Lost Lennon stuff.       I've ordered the Stripped Down - Double Fantasy discs now that I know for sure it's not in this box. Although, ... there's a lot of dead space in this big box. I wonder... Maybe it's in there somewhere.
B001N26GFM|5.0|This is one of the best movies. Everything about it made for easy viewing. No gratuitous violence or sex or language. Exceptional for family viewing.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Without giving yet another plot review, I noticed no one had really pointed out the three separate story lines that conclude so brilliantly. One involves the Harriet Vanger disappearance that is the main plot of the book, one involves the danger beset Blomkvist and Salanader during the investigation, and the final most unexpected one involves the set up to Blomkvist's original downfall. Surprises abound with one especially riveting and unusual character - Salander, the girl with a genius intellect, but who is immature emotionally and socially.
0805092447|4.0|My son and I are big fans of the Hungry Caterpillar book, which we have in board book in several languages, but now he has pretty much outgrown the format (though not the story) at nearly 5 years old and in preschool. We found this Brown Bear book at the bookstore and immediately snapped it up... the text which seems babyish and simple for a preschooler in a board book becomes prime material for an early reader in this \\"big kid\\" version.<br /><br />My son likes that it is the same format as his Beginner Reader Dr. Seuss books. I like that the repetition and simple words help with his fledgling literacy. There are a few emerging literacy games in the back of the book: matching animal picture to word for instance, that add to the educational value of this book. It is now becoming as beloved as the Hungry Caterpillar, and we will watch out for the other My First Readers that are set to come out in this format in 2011.<br /><br />Recommended.
B001NLKT60|4.0|This novel is a stand alone story occurring after, but not necessarily tied to, the first novel. Its deeper character study of Salander is intriguing, but is more of a straightforward detective novel than the first with its multi-storied approach (Harriet Vanger, the Vanger family secrets, and Wennstrom stories all coming together to multiple conclusions).<br /><br />By contrast, this one seems to leave off after one mystery is solved, but with a central character still in crisis. That indicates the third book continues with this story. It's certainly well-written and paced, but not as satisfying nor as complex as the brilliant first novel.
B0000509C4|5.0|Me personally I'm a big fan of the Creepshow films and I think Creepshow 2 is a pretty decent sequel to the first.Let's me frank here the music is made on analog synthesizers mostly to give it a eerie atmosphere,the acting is okay,and the stories are introduced by a character called 'The Creep'.There's only 3 stories in the sequel but they actually make up for it with good stories.Yes there are at times a few dark comedic moments in the movie but this film was actually played in movi theaters ulike alot of low-budget movies today that are made straight to DVD.If you enjoy Tales From The Crypt you'll like Creepshow 2,it was never a major blockbuster hit like The Exorcist or Halloween but it's a hidden gem among the horror movie hits :)
B001FB4W0C|5.0|What is not to like.  The actors are incredible and make the show very serious, scary, and funny at the same time.  Arrived in great condition and quickly.

0525951652|5.0|I paid $20 plus tax for the hardcover, and I like this book, the story is very interesting, and I consider it worth the money, however I WOULDN'T pay $36 for it  which I think is ridicolous
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Wonderful TV show.  Full of scary demons and great actors, Jensen Acles and Jared Padelecki.  They really do complement each other as brothers on the show.  Arrived quickly and in good condition.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|It is a rather typical boy meets girl, save the girl is plagued with a rather intrusive mother and a spineless father (who later discovers his spine), and, oh yes, a pig nose.  Ricci and McAvoy develop rather interesting chemistry and seem to have fun with their roles.  Reese Witherspoon's muse/sprite role was well done and she managed to subdue her star power so the leads could get their due.  Fun movie.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|What a wonderful broadway show.  The music is fantastic.  A whole new take on the Wizard of Oz, Wicked Witch.  Arrived in great condition and very quickly.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Wow, what a great new show.  These two actors, Jensen Acles and Jared Padeleck are great to look at, great actors, and the show is scary, exciting and amusing at the same time.  Hope the show never ends.  Arrived quickly and in good condition.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|This film is no DOUBT one of the best films in years dealing with subject matter that is controversial; but that is what the world needs, to deal with issues that are usually hidden behind closed doors.  The acting is ao good I almost wanted to jump into the screen and take part. It should really get a 10-star rating.
B001S86J1C|4.0|It's a bit better quality than the DVD, but not incredibly better.<br />If it wasn't inexpensive I would have stuck with the DVD version.
0671646788|1.0|There are some basic insights here that carry through the ages - think positively, be respectful to others, don't procrastinate and so forth - but the simplistic examples cited in this book all hail from the 1950's when Eisenhower was president, the down payment on a house was $1500, and a pound of grapes cost 15 cents. The relevancy of this book, geared mostly towards so called \\"salesmen\\", may have been high about 60 years ago, but just doesn't translate to the year 2010 - the age of the Internet, eCommerce, and social networking. This book is hopelessly outdated.
B001IB63KQ|4.0|The sound is great for a live show event.  Not on par with a real source Dolby Digital sound track, yet, I play it with simulated Dolby PL II in \\"music\\" setting and it comes out really good !  Hence the 4 stars instead of 5.    Haley is doing a great job on stage:  she is dynamite !    The CD sound is impeccable with great stereo separation.
B002MRRRAA|5.0|I loved this video of Nirvana's concert at Reading.  I've seen clips of it online for so many years, and finally I have a full length and full quality version of it!  I only wish the CD (that I also purchased) did not have the ad libbing and things from the concert taken out.
044654759X|5.0|Like it or not, it brings awareness to domestic violence, something that happens to thousands of women everyday.  Good for Nicholas Sparks for taking a big step!
0470185317|5.0|Very well written book, in a practical style. It's not a recipe book, it actually teaches you VHDL fundamentals by practising with the Digilent Spartan-3 board (or any similar Spartan board).    Author starts with basic combinational circuits (comparators, etc) and then moves into sequential and more advanced topics - Even a picoblaze chapter is included. You learn why the examples have been written in that way, possible caveats and solutions. Then you have some proposed exercises to help you master the topic. All this with a very good style and good attention to the details.    A *must have*.
030745455X|4.0|I am two thirds of the way through it and can hardly put it down. The heroine must be one of the strangest ever thought up! It is extremely well written and has a well thought out plot. It is good that in this part of the trilogy the cast is still virtually the same, and you don't have to refocus during the plot. I find it utterly fascinating, and vote Lisbeth one of the best heroines ever!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I have watched this movie so many times, and everytime I watch in on my 60 inch flatscreen and surround sound its like Im watching it for the first time. I am a huge JJ Abrams fan, and Chris Pine so I cannot wait for the sequel. This is my new favorite movie!
0811870413|5.0|this book is about making possibly the best bread in the world in your own home. How dare people write a review without themselves attempting to make the bread described in this book?    This is the book. This is what I've been missing. I have made Jim Leahey's no knead bread ever since Mark Bittman published it in the New York Times. Good bread, very good. But after a few years, I'm not enthused about it anymore, its lacking something.   I tried sourdough... I purchased Ed Wood's \\" Classic  Sourdoughs\\", good work on sourdoughs but not helpful for my bread making. I tried two different starters, tried bread, tried pizza. It didn't work for me. What Ed Wood lacks in his book is the intricacies, the small details, the tricks that are essential to making that perfect french loaf.   Yes this book is about making that perfect french loaf of bread. For whatever reason, the French make the best bread in Earth. The author of this book \\"Tartine bread\\" apprenticed with French artisan bakers. Chad Robertson shares his tricks that he has picked up from fifteen years of artisan bread making. Apparently, he makes good bread, his bakery in San Francisco sells out his daily production within one hour of hitting the shelves.    Anyways, about the bread, about MY BREAD.  I made the bread yesterday, actually I've been in the process of making it for four days.  I had an Ed Wood's starter that had been stashed away in the back of my fridge for over a year.  It took me three days to reactivate it, with repeated feedings finally got the batch to double in volume two nights ago, so had my starter ready to go (which is cheating because the author describes how to make your own starter from scratch in 3-5 days).   On the first day I made an active leaven, then in the evening added this to flour and water and salt to make the dough. I let the dough rise overnight, then prepped it the next day and baked it in the afternoon. Bakes just like no knead bread.  The results? Well, it looks pretty much like no knead bread, but when I cut into it, it has a sour smell, but when I taste it, the sour taste is there but not sharp and not unpleasant. The crumb is fantastic and the texture, when you bite into it fresh, is unbelievable. The bread is now a day old, and looks and tastes great, it definitely has more character then no knead bread.   My bread is not perfect (who do you know that does things perfectly on the first go?). My dough was a little flat, lacks oven spring. My slashes didn't expand during bake. My dough was tough, lacked extension, when I folded it for final shaping. But I am pretty happy with this new methodology. A lot more involved than no knead bread, but achievable for anyone with the motivation to make a great loaf of bread.  If you want to take your no knead bread to the next level this is the book.  thanks Chad

B0040YFR1Y|4.0|After the horrendous AVP (Paul W.S. Anderson, you owe the public an apology), and the even more insulting atrocity that was AVP2, I did not have high hopes for this film. Having had only 2 films made, the Predator franchise didn't really need a reboot yet. The end of the second movie, despite major flaws, hinted at some real possibilities and I would've liked to see where the franchise could've gone with Predator 3 going into the past (remember the flintlock pistol inscribed \\"Raphael Adolini 1715\\"?).<br /><br />John McTiernan's 1987 original is held in almost sacred regard by many and is widely considered one of finest action/sci-fi films ever made. It had great action, with a colorful ensemble cast, and its impact on popular culture is enormous (\\"if it bleeds, we can keel eet\\" and other oft-parodied lines; and the basis for the cover of the Nintendo video game [[ASIN:B0009VRFFS Contra]], a legend in its own right). It certainly is in my top 5 sci-fi films, so any remake/reboot would have a steep uphill climb ahead of itself. Add a Hungarian director few people have heard of and you've got a lot of nervous Predator fans.<br /><br />It's far from the taught, suspense-filled movie that the original was, but I'm glad to say that Predators is quite enjoyable, warts and all. It's a bit cheesy, with some stilted dialogue and a B-movie/low-budget feel, but overall, the film is entertaining. It gets off to a very rocky start and I was hostile to the movie for pretty much all of the first 30 minutes until the action picked up. It certainly doesn't have the star power or larger than life personalities of the original, although the action is solid and that's what we came for. Most of the iconic Predator moments are here, along with lines that pay homage to the original. The plot is the same, with slight twists and reinterpretations to make it new and familiar all at the same time.<br /><br />As for criticisms, I won't be too harsh on this film because it's supposed to be mindless alien fun. As already mentioned, the characters are not nearly as memorable or as much fun as Arnold's original gang of bad-asses. Visually, there's a bit missing. Some of the jungle scenes looks really fake and is quite obvious that they were shot on a soundstage (over half of the film was shot in Texas for tax benefits). The gaunt Adrien Brody isn't totally convincing as a combat-hardened ex-military commando and mercenary, but he is quite likable all the same, as is the Yakuza character and mini-gun wielding Spetnaz commando Nikolai (sort of Jesse Ventura's counterpart in this film). A frequent Robert Rodriguez collaborator, leather-faced Danny Trejo's appearance in the film is all too brief. I wished he had a bigger role in the movie. Topher Grace is the only one who seems miscast and out of place. Lastly, is the wacky sound design. The soundtrack uses the same tribal-sounding percussion and horns motif that the original did, but it cuts in and out unexpectedly and lacks the focus and punch that Alan Silvestri's score had (listen to the end of \\"Journey Trek\\").<br /><br />Worth watching if you're an action fan. Just don't take it too seriously or compare too much against the original. I'm looking forward to Predators 2, as there clearly will be one from the ending.ady mentioned, the characters are not nearly as memorable or as much fun as Arnold's original gang of bad-asses.

0439023491|5.0|This was an excellent follow-up to the Hunger Games. I felt the beginning was a bit slow, but it definitely speeds up and ends fantastically. Although I feel like there is a disconnect in tone between this one and Mockingjay (the final book), I still would recommend this to anyone wanting a read they cannot put down.
B002JCSWVG|5.0|I found this to be the most inspiring movie I have seen in years. Depicting the characters with such sensitivity and passion.  I was left wanting more. I did several searches to find out more and ashamed to say that until now, I only knew Mandela by name and where he was from.. I had no idea what a humble and yet wise man he is. I must say he was put in South Africa for \\"such a time as this.\\" I recommend this movie to those who desire to learn more of the history it portrays.
B00002ND77|5.0|Malcolm said, \\"We didn't land on Plymouth Rock, Plymouth Rock landed on us.\\" He said what needed to be said out loud, and everybody finally woke up to the devastation and the need for effective action.
B003W5C0VW|4.0|This DVD version looks and sounds pretty good. The sound is full, although I think Bill Wyman's bass has been decreased a little bit compared to the boot versions. Wyman's bass is less boomy in the mix, but it's still there. The DVD also includes the possibly post-doctored backup/harmony vocals on \\"Happy,\\" just like the boots -- Jagger's vocals are heard along with Keith Richards', even though Jagger is away from the microphone (and out of frame). Maybe the audio was dropped in from another night, since this was shot over different days. Visually, the DVD is pretty impressive, although there are the occasional red/light brown patches on the right and left sides of the screen (mostly from one camera angle)- they're not overly annoying, but they are noticeable at times. They might have been just too much trouble to digitally clean up from the source prints? The rehearsal footage for the 1972 tour is interesting, although it's way too short. More footage would have been an awesome addition, but maybe more will be released later. The 2010 Jagger interview is decent, but not spectacular; the 1972 interview with Jagger is OK, too. In a perfect world, bonus/previously unreleased footage that was shot or at least taped from the soundboard on those days would have been great, but what is here on this DVD version is a winner. A-

B003NX76BM|1.0|I love to read Nora Roberts books, I know I can pick up one any time on the run and be delighted but this one has crude language and violence. The dog training was interesting but too detailed.Sorry, not her best and probably her worst in my opinion.
0525951652|2.0|OK. I got past the rip-off kindle price deal, bought the hard cover (publisher might as well be out some real money) because I loved Follett's last books, esp. Pillars. I am 100 pages from the end and forcing myself through this book. It is partly full of information about war strategy, and partly dealing with character development. I somehow felt the book couldn't decide what it should be. It certainly is no where near his other books and is the first that has taken me weeks to read because it is so boring. I agree with some of the other comments that found the book slow, and I doubt that I will buy the sequels. Maybe that's where he got into trouble by holding back info because he plans on writing two more books.
0321647440|4.0|To be clear, my experience level with Aperture 3 is zero.  I have never used the program before and do not have any experience with other applications like Photoshop or Lightroom 3.    Because of my inexperience, I really wanted a book that covered it all.  In that respect, this book really fits the bill nicely.  The author goes over aspects of the program including importing, tagging, editing and sharing your pictures.  The book includes a disc with sample images you can use to follow along with his \\"lesson plans\\".  I found this to be extremely helpful.  It's one thing to read a book where they talk about what a function does, but to have a sample image that you can edit as you read along really reinforces what that function does ... it's immediate and positive feedback that you're doing it right.    The book is definitely geared towards the beginner.  If you already understand concepts of managing your photos, basic editing, etc ... then this book may be too simple for you.  I was hoping for a little more detail on some of the more advanced editing functions like using the curves brick, etc.  Also, almost half the book covers just the importing and managing of your photos.  I personally would have preferred a little more emphasis on editing the photos ... but that's a personal nit-pick.    Pros:  1. Great introduction to the application.  2. Includes sample images you can use to follow along.  3. Well written, easy to follow and understand.    Cons:  1. Maybe too much emphasis on file management.  2. Not enough detail on some of the more advanced functions.  3. You have to follow the book very closely, or you may find some images not immediately accessible.    All that being said, if you take the time to read this book and follow along with the lesson plans you *will* have a strong understanding of the basics and will definitely have more fun using the program.

If you are wondering where Val Kilmer is he's the guy who plays Elvis in 2 scenes, guiding Clarence in his wild ways.
B002ZG98XW|5.0|I did not know the story of \\"Big Red\\" aka \\"Secretariat\\" before yesterday when I went to see this movie. I do believe I was the only one in the theatre who did not know the out come for all through the movie I felt as though I was the only one clapping, or gripping the side arms of my seat..... the movie about made my heart burst due to the anticipation and desire for the underdog to win!  I loved the racing scenes in this film, the beauty of a horse running and running, flexing everyone of it's muscles, doing what it knows it was born to do!  The communication/love between Big Red and his owner is heart breaking and one that a true animal lover can relate to.  This film was expertly done and I encourage everyone to go see \\"Secretariat\\"!!!!  Stay until the end when they show who played who for it is one of those great movies where you just want to know what happened to all of the key players ....the ending will share their whereabouts.<br />All my best to under-dogs and animal lovers everywhere!!!<br />Darby
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I love my Kindle and the reading it affords me.  And I love Ken Follett. However, the price of $19.99 is a solid barrier to my reading this ebook.   The publishers think they can charge giant prices and get away with it.  We readers need to respond by boycotting such high priced ebooks...resulting in a \\"fall of giant\\" prices.  My hope is to eventually purchase this book at a much reduced price.
B00005Y46O|4.0|Great band - great music.  The recording on this live compilation, at least a few of the cuts, isn't the the same quality as they are on other cd's I own.  For instance, \\"Trouble on Double Time\\" is a much better recording on the compilation album \\"Chronicles\\", but still this is well worth your money if you are a Free fan and if you're not a Free fan you probably will be after listening to this....

B000002C2E|5.0|&#34;Time Out of Mind&#34; was Bob Dylan's first album of original material in seven years, and was the result of a long period of artistic as well as personal soul searching.<br /><br />After briefly rebounding from a mostly fallow period with 1989's excellent &#34;Oh Mercy,&#34; Dylan quickly slipped back into the abyss with 1990's &#34;Under the Red Sky,&#34; followed by a period of uninspired and often embarrassing live performances marred by lack of inspiration and occasional heavy drinking, resulting in forgotten words, awful singing (by Dylan standards) and bizarre butcherings of classic songs. Though there were some silver linings during this time, it wasn't until Fall of 1992 that Bob finally made an effort to consistently try and reclaim his once untouchable position in the music world, with the release of the blues covers album &#34;Good As I Been to You&#34; and a series of truly stunning live performances.<br /><br />Throughout 1993 and 1994 he gradually improved, his singing and playing became more focused and expressive, culminating in a triumphant comeback performance at Woodstock 25.  Throughout 1995 and 1996, he gave some of the most original and powerful concerts of his career, despite not having any new material to prove his newly rediscovered chops with.<br /><br />By Fall of 1996, however, Dylan had begun writing new songs at his home, the core of which became &#34;Time Out of Mind,&#34; his strongest record since &#34;Blood on the Tracks.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Time Out of Mind&#34; is probably Dylan's darkest album to date.  It's a reflection on mortality that focuses on past heartbreaks, loneliness and other devastating emotions. Thematically, it's a heavy album, without the typical moments of catharsis that permeate much of Dylan's previous records. It's more of a `mood' piece than any other Dylan album, which is part of its greatness.<br /><br />From the opening, repetitive riff of &#34;Love Sick,&#34; it's clear Dylan has regained his power.  His battered voice is perfect for the world weary, sorrowful milieu these songs paint, and Daniel Lanois's gloomy production only strengthens that feel.<br /><br />Dylan's sense of making the listener feel and envision a song reaches its zenith on &#34;Time Out of Mind.&#34;  Abandoning the wordy, surrealist feel of his 1960s' work, each song on the record is written with razor sharp precision and heart wrenching detail. The album's standout track for me, is &#34;Standing in the Doorway,&#34; a smoky, Sinatrae-sque recalling of a one of a kind heartbreak that will tear into your soul; with lines like &#34;I don't know if I saw you, if I would kiss ya or kill ya&#34; and &#34;the stars have turned cherry red,&#34; it rightfully ranks among Dylan's finest later day compositions.<br /><br />Other high points include the jumpy &#34;Dirt Road Blues,&#34; the eerie, gritty, in the pocket groove of &#34;Cold Irons Bound,&#34; (one of the best musical arrangements ever created for a Dylan song), the tender &#34;Make You Feel My Love,&#34; and the shattering &#34;Not Dark Yet.&#34;  Almost the whole record, however, is uniformly strong, with only the sixteen minute closer &#34;Highlands&#34; being somewhat superfluous (though its shorteneded live performances would become highlights of his concerts from 1999 to 2001).<br /><br />&#34;Time Out of Mind&#34; firmly and rightfully reestablished Bob Dylan as a vital creative force, launching a comeback many thought not possible, and one whose wave of success is still being ridden today.ry, sorrowful milieu these songs paint, and Daniel Lanois's gloomy production only strengthens that feel.

Other high points include the jumpy &#34;Dirt Road Blues,&#34; the eerie, gritty, in the pocket groove of &#34;Cold Irons Bound,&#34; (one of the best musical arrangements ever created for a Dylan song), the tender &#34;Make You Feel My Love,&#34; and the shattering &#34;Not Dark Yet.&#34;  Almost the whole record, however, is uniformly strong, with only the sixteen minute closer &#34;Highlands&#34; being somewhat superfluous (though its shorteneded live performances would become highlights of his concerts from 1999 to 2001).  &#34;Time Out of Mind&#34; firmly and rightfully reestablished Bob Dylan as a vital creative force, launching a comeback many thought not possible, and one whose wave of success is still being ridden today.

0440244870|4.0|One my favorite guilty pleasures in life is a fiction book that is well written and endearing. Call it chick lit, call it pop culture, call it whatever you want. There's nothing better during the cold months of the year than a book you love to curl up with.<br /><br />Throw in a book that throws around some British humor and I'm in heaven.<br /><br />I recently picked up Confessions of a Shopaholic on a whim and as soon as I started it, I couldn't put it down. I totally adored this book. I haven't seen the movie and to be the honest, I'm in no hurry because inevitably, I find fault with book-based movies especially when I love the lead character.<br /><br />Becky Bloomwood is a financial writer who has a dark secret of an ever-accumulating pile of debt. She has a soft spot for shopping (or rather an uncontrollable urge to buy everything she sees) and decides that she needs to turn her life around. She tries the \\"spend less\\" route than decides the \\"make more money\\" route is better suited to her lifestyle.<br /><br />Through one misadventure after another, Becky finds herself navigating a financial world that she's only written about. She's a girl with a heart of gold and her fantastical daydreams about fame and fortune made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella is an amazingly talented writer. She's so good that right after I finished this book, I headed to my favorite library and got Shopaholic Takes Manhattan and Shopaholic Ties the Knot.<br /><br />There are at least two more books in the series and I'm looking forward to devouring those as well. Need a last minute Christmas gift for the book lover in your life? I highly recommend this series for anyone who really enjoys some good old fashioned Chick-Lit.

0783226837|5.0|The cover illustration, like most hack work, doesn't bear looking at, because whoever produced it had obviously never watched the film. Ah, well ...  The film is really very good ... I need not decribe it; it's easy to understand. One of the most remarkable features of the film is the female lead, who, not only does she not wear \\"issue ingenue\\" clothing, she even fails to break a heel off a stiletto shoe (she wears sensible outdoor work boots of excellent quality) while fleeing from the monster. Unheard of! She is a scientist, and manages to get through the entire film without batting her eyelashes at Kevin Bacon.  Bacon himself plays his part flawlessly ... what else is there to say?  The cast is further expanded by the two survivalists, Michael Gross and Reba McEntyre, who play their parts with élan, and have a lot of fun (yeah, you can tell).  The film is kept light, but not tongue-in-cheek. Watch it; it's fun, and yes, even a film this light-hearted can give you a couple of scares.
0670827592|3.0|This was a repurchase for me.  Our original copy was destroyed in flooding from hurricane Katrina.  I love the story, but was disappointed when I received this book.  In the original copy I owned there was a letter to the parole board from A. Wolf in the beginning of the book.  That letter set the stage for the story and was 1/2 the humor.  This copy did not contain the letter (this was a new book not a used one).

B0036TGSRG|4.0|Generally I avoid movies that are about the war in Iraq, simply because there have been so many. I only watched this because it has been directed by Roman Polanski, who delivers great movies. The Ghost Writer is about a author (Evan McGregor ) who has been picked to ghost write for Adam Lang ( Pierce Brosnan ) a former British Prime Minister. The circumstances under which McGregor was picked were tragic and mysterious because the prior ghost writer died. As he commences his ghost writing duties, he starts discovering some chilling revelations.<br />I thought the movie was excellent in all respects, especially the writing, acting and direction. The movie takes place in the confines of Martha's Vineyard and some other locations. The entire mood of the movie is somber and gloomy and something always seems to be simmering under the surface. Each character has been brilliantly written and suspicious. The conclusion is also surprising and chilling. Based on a book, The Ghost by Robert Harris, the references draw parallels to Tony Blair. There is also a Condi Rice lookalike in one scene. Kim Cattrall acts reserved a complete change from the loud role she has had on the Sex and the City series. Olivia Williams is splendid as the frustrated but in control wife of the Prime Minister. Evan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan are great and so is Tom Wilkinson in a brief but important role. I would watch this movie again. 4 stars. 10/3/10

0517548232|5.0|Over 40 years ago, Mr. Hazlitt wrote:    \\"Government guaranteed home mortgages, especially when a negligible down-payment or no down payment whatever is required, inevitably mean more bad loans than otherwise. They force the general taxpayer to subsidize bad risks and to defray the losses. They encourage people to 'buy' houses they cannot really afford. They tend eventually to bring about an oversupply of houses as compared with other things. They temporarily overstimulate building, raise the cost of building for everybody (including the buyers of the homes with the guaranteed mortgages), and may mislead the building industry into an eventually costly overexpansion. In brief, in the long run they do not increase overall national production but encourage malinvestment.\\"    If this was the only sentence in this book our current so-called economists had read, understood and applied when Fannie and Freddie came waddling down the pike, we wouldn't be in the mess we're in today. You'll find more of the same 'unobjective', observation-based thinking throughout this little gem of a book - so please read it if you're at all interested in saving yourself and this country from the approaching disaster. I especially recommend the chapter \\"The Mirage of Inflation\\", because brother, it's coming soon to devastate an economy near you, and we need the help of honest intellectuals like Mr. Hazlitt to help us understand and oppose \\"the hidden tax\\" - before it's too late.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|I did not know this series at all but purchased it because I wanted to add something new to my collection. Very entertaining!  The only problem I had was periodic difficulty understanding Wooster's accent. If you are an Anglophile I would recommend this series wholeheartedly.  You won't be disappointed.
B0043RSIUK|3.0|I'm 1/3 of the way through and I will finish but its a bit of a slog. While it is worthwhile to get the  history to the lead in to the war I wonder if the level of detail was necessary.  All ponderous.As well the angst and fretting probably reflected the times (as it always does in the lead up to conflict) it did not need to go on ad nauseum. We get it.    The characters are stock with no depth. The working class men are noble and smart, the male nobility are vain and vacuous and the women either smart fiesty and downtrodden or monetarally dependent but intellectually independent. Not bad things but too too trite and predictable.     Similarly. the relationships and outcomes you can see coming a mile away. I'll bet before we are done we will see brother fighting brother.    Unless this produces something that grabs and holds I will not be looking forward to the sequels.

1416972242|4.0|City of Ashes is book two of The Mortal Instruments Series. The series is going strong and getting better. :) Plot...  Clary, Jace, and Simon are still twisted together in a love triangle, despite Jace seeming to be her possible brother.  It gets more interesting as Alec becomes involved with a Warlock, Magnus Bane who seems to come through constantly to save the teens with amazing powers.  Simon turns into a vampire and feels drawn to another Downworlder Maia, interestingly a werewolf who likes Simon, despite his unrequited love for Clary.  The mash-up gang of Shadowhunters and Downworlders find themselves in a battle against Jace and Clary's \\"father\\" who has stolen two of the Mortal Instruments and plans to raise an army of demons to defeat the Clave and wield enormous powers.  Jace appears to be the criminal as he converses with his father behind the backs of his family and friends, but his choice to defy his father, creates an interesting end as he finds himself with new powers of his own. Unfortunatly it seems as though each person who know Jace's history ends up dieing or disappearing before they can spit it out. In the end the fantasy friends have the ultimate battle aboard Valentine's ship in the East River, which Clary destroys with her knew found rune drawing super power.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I had a hard time putting it down.  I sat in utter stillness and awe as I finished the book.  I thought it was profound and stunning.  Through the eyes of Liesel, the main character, I experienced a story about WWII and Nazi Germany in a way I had never experienced it before.  The fact that the book is narrated by Death is a clever and interesting twist.  Liesel, Rudy, Hans, Max...and, yes, Death....I shall never forget you and I thank you for your courage and your lives.

1416955070|4.0|City of Bones is the first book in a three part series called The Mortal Instruments.  In a previous post, I read Clokckwork Angel also by Clare that is the first book in a pre-quel series to this one.  City of Bones was excellent for what it is, a young-adult fiction fantasy series. It is heavily addicting, and I breezed through the 500 or so pages in two days. The fantasy world Clare creates is strong with so many details, it sucks you in and you just want to stay there for hours.<br /><br />Clary an ordinary New York girl, finds out that her life has all been a lie. Her mother and evil father had been shadowhunters, demon killers. Her mother ran away from her husband and erased Clary's mind in order to protect her from the fantasy world.  After her mother is kidnapped, Clary has to put the pieces back together and separate out the truth from the lies. She is not alone in her quest however; Simon, her best human friend who is secretly in love with her, and her new shadowhunter friend Jace, who saves Clary's life on more than one occasion, are there to help her.  The two battle for Clary's love, as the shadowhunters search for a mortal cup that her mother hid for only Clary to find.  Unfortunately the mortal cup falls into the wrong hands and Jace and Clary are left with a strange twist of fate that puts their growing relationship at a standstill.

B000GSA59M|4.0|Despite the long description and photo, this is the current model with the built-in USB and the compressors on the mic channels. At least that is so for the one I bought from Amazon.    Why the 3 star rating.     1. Inadequate gain on the pre's. While it may be fine for mic'ing your guitar cabinet, it is not adequate for voice over work.    2. Inconsistent performance, each channel requires different setting with the same mic.    3. Unbalanced, you need to pan a mic (to the left on mine) to get it to center the stereo image.    Despite those problems, it seems to be a great mixing console for the money, you would need to speed twice what I did to get the same features in another brand. For a working pro that is probably a good idea, but for the home user like me the savings is worth more than the inconvenience those problems cause. The reason for the down rating is 90% because of the inadequate preamp gain problem. They really need another 20db gain.     I do not know why they chose to do it that way? Afraid users would turn it up too much and destroy their amp and speakers? Too cheap to provide a 20db pad? As it is you wind up amplifying the noise in the subsequent stages along with the signal. Probably where Behringer gets their reputation for noisy preamps.    The one knob compressors seem to work OK. I quickly found out that their instructions to turn it up until the red LED came on was not good advice, unless you like choppy distorted sound. Turning it up until the LED comes on, and then backing off until it just does not seems to be about the best setting. That does bring up the signal level a bit, but it also brings up the noise level so you have to back off to keep the noise down, which kind of (partially) defeats the purpose. Still it does help a bit.    The internal USB seems to work well, Windows (XP Pro x64, in my case) keeps resetting to the internal sound card so it is a good idea to check that has not happened. The mixer and Audacity do not seem to use ASIO4ALL despite the manuals saying both are ASIO compatible.    As I said 90% of what I do not like about this mixer is the lack of adequate preamplifier gain. If that was fixed I would give it a solid 4-4.5 rating.    ADDED: Behringer Support said the mixer was defective. I exchange it for another one, amazon was great about that. That fixed all three of the problems mentioned above. However, the mic pre's are still a bit weak and noisy for my taste (I raised my rating to 4 stars, from 3, if the pre's were better I would give it 5 now). I can see the pre's giving 60db of gain on the replacement, but that is kind of weak if you want to run dynamics with -72db sensitivity on it, however with an outboard preamp you should be able to peg everything, and the noise is no existent.    One of the things I often see in these kinds of mini-reviews is people deciding that the equipment is junk without even trying to get a good one. At this price point they are not all tested as the come off the assembly line, you may have to be the final QC tester. I feel that for $100+ savings over a more expensive one that is acceptable.    While this one is missing a few things that the X1204USB has, it does have a better 12 step VU meter.  I did not realize that until looking more closely at teh X1204USB spec's.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|Ok, everyone. That IS a ridiculous price for a kindle book. And it DOES suggest price gouging. And it DOES go against the whole kindle philosophy, especially if you spent $400 for your kindle a couple of years ago with the promise of having super cheap books for life. But I, as someone who just wants to see what other readers have thought of the book itself, find it frustrating to have to sort through all these reviews that have only to do with the price and not the content. Surely there must be a better outlet for your concerns, Maybe contacting Amazon directly? Otherwise, this book will have a permanently negative review through no fault of its own. :(

B003EYVXUK|4.0|The Swedish film LET THE RIGHT ONE IN (based on the Swedish novel of the same name) was on my top ten list last year.  It was creepy, heartbreaking, violent, original, stylish & very well acted.  It tells the story of a deeply lonely young boy, bullied at school and torn between his divorced parents.  At 12, he's right on the cusp of young manhood...but still he is lagging slightly behind his classmates and thus is a friendless target for some pretty significant abuse.  A new tenant moves into the apartment next to his...and older, weary looking man and a girl about his age.    The two strike up a friendship when meeting to chat every night at the monkey bars by his apartment building.  The boy, while sweet and quiet, also is barely masking an urge to inflict violence on his tormentors.  The girl, while sad and mysterious, is drawn to her new neighbor.    We come to discover that the girl is a vampire and that the old man has been her companion for many years, and is her procurer of blood.  When he is nearly discovered in action one night...a chain of events is set off that puts everyone in serious peril.    The story invites us to sympathize and root for an extremely wicked creature...and we do.  The relationship that develops between the two youngsters (although we know the girl is hardly as young as she appears) is one of the most delicate and touching \\"young romances\\" we've ever seen...and we give ourselves over completely to their plight.    Why have I spent so much time describing a film that I'm not reviewing?  Because the American remake, called LET ME IN, tells the exact same story and has much the same effect.  Yet in the end, it is inferior to the original.      Both movies are roughly the same length.  Yet the European original manages to have more plot points.  For example, the boy (named Owen in America, played by Kodi Smit-McPhee) travels to visit his father in the Swedish film, but never gets that far in the American.  These scenes were critical to showing just how disconnected the boy feels.  Also, the Swedish film introduces us to a whole network of unemployed friends, who hang out at local bars and take care of each other.  It is one of their own who falls victim to the vampire, and one of this group that investigates the incident.  The American film provides us with a fairly generic cop (Elias Koteas).     The Swedish film rarely relied on any special effects, but the American one uses CGI whenever we see the vampire attacking an adult victim.  Sadly, it is very badly accomplished CGI...and makes what should have been some pretty disturbing scenes almost laughable.      But the American film does give us Chloe Moretz (KICK ASS) as Abby, the young vampire.  She's an impressive young actor, and manages a very nice performance (as does Smit-McPhee).  She carries a sadness, because she knows just how different and how WRONG she is.  We can see these two, not as kindred spirits perhaps, but as two halves of a whole.    The American film takes place in 1983, in winter, in Los Alamos, New Mexico.  It was filmed on location...BUT the location holds no resonance.  It is just a generic, snowy, dreary small town.  I'm glad they filmed the movie in my home state...but they could have filmed it anywhere with snow.    It sounds like I'm hugely criticizing the film...but in reality, if you've not seen the original, LET ME IN should be a pretty terrific movie-going experience.  It takes the vampire genre and breathes new and very original life into it.  It is well acted and emotionally satisfying.  I wish the pace had sometimes been just a little bit faster...but overall, it is worthwhile.  It is most assuredly not for children...because the children in this film are not exactly models of virtue.  If I set the original production out of my mind, LET ME IN is a quiet but almost haunting little horror-romance that is unlike anything out of Hollywood in the last few years.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|This novel wraps up a lot of the pressing themes introduced in the first two books, while opening up additional possibilities for him to explore in future novels in the same universe - while still giving you a good resolution at the end. He leaves you wanting more because he's created an intriguing universe that you want to read more about - not because he left the story hanging. This is well written, fast paced and draws you in. Good brain candy.

0312600844|5.0|This novel deserves the glowing professional reviews and maybe even the rush to declare this book one of the best novels in contemporary fiction. I was hooked from the first chapter. I remained engrossed in the characters and plot twists, and I found the novel beautifully crafted. I'd quibble with his need to include so many characters, though, especially the ever expanding relatives whose stories we learn. Save some for the next book, JF! That's a quibble worth 2 points out of 1,000, though. I loved this book.<br /><br />Joan Price, author [[ASIN:1580051529 Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty]]
0312600844|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Franzen's book.  It's not a book with a strong plot.  But instead it's a brilliant portrait of the modern family and of our times.  The writing is illuminating and the characters real.  I dare anyone to read the first chapter and not be intrigued.
0316069485|5.0|Connelly's reputation as a top rank crime writer is due to his many books featuring dour LAPD detective Harry Bosch. However, in recent years, he's introduced a new protagonist: fast-talking criminal defense attorney Micky Haller (see [[ASIN:B002MAQSAM The Lincoln Lawyer]]), who just happens to be Bosch's half-brother. In [[ASIN:0446583936 The Brass Verdict]] he had them team up, and here he does so again, with alternating chapters. The story opens with a big twist, as Los Angeles District Attorney wants to hire Haller as a prosecutor for a case involving the retrial of a man held 23 years for the abduction and murder of a young girl. It seems that new DNA evidence has emerged, and pretty much everyone thinks he's going to walk (and sue the city for wrongful imprisonment).<br /><br />Having confounded expectations right off the bat, Connelly then has Haller insist that his ex-wife (Maggie \\"McFierce\\" who's also shown up in previous books) act as his co-counsel, and that Bosch is assigned as his investigator. This sets the wheels in motion for a page-turner (in all the best senses of the term), as Haller and Bosch wade into the old case and try and come up with something that'll put the guy back on death row. Haller's specialty is being able to anticipate all the dirty tricks the defense is going to try and use, while Bosch's speciality is getting into the head of the perp and tenaciously pursuing all leads. We switch back and forth between the half-brothers each chapter, with Haller's in first-person and Bosch's in third-person, a technique I quite liked. It's kind of dual-procedural, half legal, half police -- all entertaining. To be sure, some of the legal shenanigans seem pretty unlikely, and the story relies on an improbable number of people key to the original trial being dead. But it's hard to quibble with such details when you're being so completely entertained.
0385342047|4.0|I enjoyed \\"Mini Shopaholic\\", but you have to be a fan of the series to enjoy the book. This time around, Becky is still having trouble saying \\"No\\" to sales and also controlling her shopping habits and her impulses to speak/act before thinking. In \\"Mini Shopaholic\\", Becky's daughter Minnie is following in her footsteps. Minnie's favorite word is \\"mine\\" and from watching her mommy, begins ordering designer clothes online.    As long as you don't take the book too seriously, this is a fun read. There are letters to various individuals throughout the book, like in the first shopaholic book, which are amusing and add to the story. I was laughing out loud during a chapter in which Becky and family go to the \\"Pound Shop\\" (like the dollar store in the U.S.) to save money and end up with some very interesting purchases! The part that Elinor plays in the story and Becky wanting to plan the perfect surprise party for her husband Luke are both very touching.     Yes, Minnie sometimes acts like a spoiled brat, and Becky continues to get herself into ridiculous situations and definitely needs to grow up. However, as long as you don't take the book too seriously, it's a fun read and great way to catch up with your favorite characters from earlier books. The ending does set the reader up for a sequel. Perhaps Becky will learn from some of her mistakes, both in shopping and parenting, in the next installment.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|EDIT: Not that anyone will ever read this buried by now review - but this is a 5 star album and I'm changing it from 4 to 5.  I have been known on many of the Satch's latest works to come down pretty hard, generally 3's are about all I've given.. the problem is \\"generally\\" his albums lose steam just after the halfway mark (Professor Satch the absolute worst at this), and the songs tended to run together (Super Colossal), not so here.. in fact the album GROWS all the way until the end and every song is WHOLLY distinct (very important). Premonition is right up there with Cool #9 in the lead-off book, either Dream Song or Light Years Away can give Summer Song a run for the money.. Two Sides and Wormhole Wizards are as good as anything he's ever done. Thankfully (sorry Joe, not being mean, Phone Call worked perfectly) no vocals again! I wonder why no song called Black Swans..? Would have made a fine companion piece.  Personally I would have integrated Heartbeats into the real mix (or swapped it for Wind in the Trees which I find a little nondescript), dropped Solitude and Longing, and put a song more uptempo than anything here (something I feel it needs).. that would have been your 5 star album. Having given my opinion -- I can't stop listening to it, and that is the truest measure of the success of music, isn't it?
B003WKFAIW|3.0|Maroon Five make that perfect, glossy pop that sticks in your ear like a tootsie roll. They also have two main aces in that they are great pop writers and Adam Levine has a terrific voice for this kind of playfulness. For their third album, they go for the big bam boom of producer Robert Mutt Lange, who made the likes of Def Leppard and Foreigner shoot out of radios like sucker-tipped darts from plastic toy guns.<br /><br />They definitely succeed in making a gloriously catchy pop album. \\"Hands All Over\\" sounds so pristine that you could eat the cotton candy right off the disc. Levine and company now show that they can clone any style, be it the Bee Gees pop of \\"Get Back In My Life,\\" the Foreigner-lite of the title track and the Shania Twain for the boys of \\"Out Of Goodbyes\\" (featuring Lady Antebellum). There's also a bit more guitar in the mix, which adds some heft to some otherwise lightweight songs (\\"Never Gonna Leave This Bed\\" for example).<br /><br />What is missing is any sense of continuity, which the other two Maroon 5 albums had. There's plenty to like about \\"Hands All Over,\\" but I get the feeling Lange squeezed any personality out of the songs in his usual relentless push for perfection. The album sounds great. Song for song, it also works. I just wish it sounded more like a band than an art project.
0439023513|4.0|This is more in response to the reviewers who didn't like the book. Some spoilers.     While I might agree that there were some things that could have been tightened up a little better (Snow's death, Katniss agreeing to the Capitol Hunger Games, etc...) I think we all need to remember that this is not our story to tell. I think that Suzanne Collins kept true to her story and to her characters. There is no happy ending after what they all went through. There is no way to live happily ever after. You don't recover from those types of horrors. Collins could have wrapped a happy love story in a pretty bow and handed it to us, but this isn't a romance novel.    I also have a problem with those reviewers that think this was just a bunch of anti-war rhetoric. I felt it was pro-war if you're fighting for something that means more than life itself.  If there was any anti-war message, it wasn't the war itself, it was the senseless killing of people to further an agenda and for power. The manipulation and propaganda on both sides of the war was sickening and yet all to realistic.     Overall, I loved this series and while I don't have the happy peaceful feeling I like to get when I'm done reading a book, I don't think it should have ended any other way.  I will always remember this series and the people of Panem will haunt me.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|MACHETE    As any one who knows me can tell you I am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan and a huge Robert Rodriguez fan, so naturally I love their work. This film being another Grindhouse type film especially since it was based on a trailer for that film is really fun. Any one who does not like violence, naked women, and violence should stay away. Also add in that I am a huge Steven Seagal fan and that this film was filmed here in Austin Texas, you know I loved it. This of course being another film QT and RR collaborated on, and yes they did QT was an uncredited producer. It should also be noted that Danny Trejo played this character in the three Spy Kids movies.    Machete [Trejo] is a man who has some what lost his way in life ever since a drug kingpin named Torrez [Seagal] killed his family. Since then he does hard manual labor for money until he is offered a hit. The hit of course is on a Texas politician [De Niro] who has a thing against illegal immigrants in Texas. When the hit goes bad as he was set up he goes back to his federale days and goes into kill mode. As the rampage goes on and every one from politicians, to priests, underground rebels, and US agents get involved the big players start to come out. That of course being the reemergence of Torrez as he is linked with Senator McLaughlin [De Niro], turns out they have a plan to own the drug trafficking in and out of Texas.    This is a wonderfully entertaining Mexploitation flick and is one of the best times I had at the movies all year. Every thing any one could want is in this movie, from great over the top action to some great romance [Machete sex music begins to play here]. The great over the top action is brilliant but one of the best parts has to be the exit from the hospital, any one who has seen it knows what I am talking about. The blood and violence of this are actually extremely well done, it is overly fun but at the same time isn't overly campy if that makes sense. In fact like many have said the opening scenes of the film let you know exactly what type of movie this is.    Danny Trejo is wonderful as if you didn't know as Machete and is right at home in this flick. He has been doing these types of roles for Rodriguez for years; in fact he has played Machete in the \\"Spy Kids\\" flicks. Jeff Fahey is masterful here looking like he is straight out of \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and having a weird thing for his daughter, and Robert De Niro looks like he has never had more fun in any other role. Now of course you know from the trailer that the ladies are here and looking oh so good while being oh so bad. Michelle Rodriguez has never looked hotter, man I love her so much, plus her character is really cool. Jessica Alba is fun here as well and to be honest surprised me a bit, she was kinda funny. Lindsey Lohan was another surprise here as I thought she did a good job with the time she got on screen.    Of course Cheech Marin is always great and here provides a lot of great and humorous scenes. But with every one in this [all of which were great and fun] I am going to have to say Steven Seagal stole the show a bit. Now I know all kinds of people are going to disagree with me but I thought he was hilarious. His last scene with Trejo is brilliant with the sword fight and all that, but his final bit of dialogue and actions are priceless. I have never laughed so hard ever, it was truly brilliant.    Directed by Robert Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis and written by Robert and Álvaro Rodríguez this movie was extremely fun, funny, and over the top. There are also some messages about this country and its politics but they don't beat you over the head. The style of the flick is much like that of the EXCELLENT \\"Grindhouse\\" film that RR and QT gave us so you know it looks great and has a great feel. I do recommend this flick to any and every one, BUY IT when it is released. I will be picking it up the second it is released, you should do the same.
B000J10EQU|1.0|I suppose for the sake of others I should expand my review a little. First off let me say this movie is painful to watch. The story is absolutely dreadful. It's miscast from the get go. The entire cast was horrid, not just Routh. That costume was just sickening. Brown cape, trunks, and boots? No one ever thought Superman in blue and red was a bad idea. Not in the 1950s tv series, not in the comic books, not in the cartoons, not in any of the Christopher Reeve movies, not by the fans, not anywhere for the last 45 years of my 49 year life have I ever heard \\"You know, that Superman is alright but he'd be a lot better if his cape, trunks, and boots were brown.\\" Give me a break! But nooooo! that dumbass punk Bryan Singer thinks messing < (I really wanted to use the F word) with americana was a good thing. I even hate his X-men movies. Black jump suits with zippers. That's real heroic looking. This is one Superman I would not want to rescue me for fear of what he'll do to me for payment. And my exit door is an exit only door, if you know what I mean. So if you really want to know how this movie is: Read some of the other 1 star reviews. Or just blow a 5 second rasberry. And THAT'S how this movie is. I never thought it would be possible to make  Superman IV: The Quest For Peace seem so endearing and a joy to watch afterall. But this movie does just that. MY Superman wears Red and Blue not brown and turqoise. And My Superman fights a never ending battle for truth, justice, and the AMERICAN way. The fact they left \\"American way\\" out of this movie and no one protested really shows the cowardice and lack of pride we've had for this nation. Proud to be an American. Ashamed my countrymen don't feel the same way.

0307454541|4.0|As a student in Highschool, I read whenever I could. Whatever I could get my hands on. In college, reading became a chore, something I only did for homework assignments. This book brought back the joy of reading to me, and I would reccomend it for anyone who grew up reading Nancy Drew, The Hardy Boys, Lillian Jackson Braun, etc. :)
0060557818|5.0|On the face of it, Neverwhere is merely the millionth re-telling of the unwitting hero cum fish-out-of-water story, complete with all the necessary plot points and character types to make any lover of a good fantasy tale feel right at home.<br /><br />And then Gaiman spins the world 17 degrees right and 149 degrees over and tells the same old story with a different name in a brand new, compelling, and super-entertaining way. Sure, we get Richard from \\"normal world\\" who unwittingly enters \\"abnormal world\\" where he will take much of the story coming to grips with the unknown-only-to-him fact that he is the \\"hero\\" of the story. And there's Door, the girl on a quest who needs his help, and the marquis (the wizard), and Hunter (the bodyguard) and a variety of bad guys, kinda bad guys, probably bad guys and just general unknown quantities.<br /><br />But the simple and hugely pleasant fact that the story is not set in some medieval fantasy world nor involves the normal medieval fantasy world button pushing to move the story forward makes this story an incredible delight to read. Okay: page-turner. Gaiman re-invents London by burying it in its living history and then making the history live rather than fade away. Not gone are the times of London past, as time/space has a way of folding in on itself in this world just below the surface of our world. You still can't go home, again, but you can get a look at some of the stuff you missed out on the first time around. Sort of.<br /><br />The story is a race to the finish. Gaiman doesn't - indeed, with this story, he probably can't - let you ponder on some of the weirdness of his landscape. You get fleeting glimpses of the weirdest things, and then overhear snippets of conversations about things you'll never encounter, all of which builds in a more complex world than the simple cat-and-mouse, race-for-your-life story at the center of the novel.<br /><br />The story is also beautifully and elegantly written. Gaiman ignores the fiction writer's guild-required \\"fantasy prose construct\\" and writes easy, flowing sentences. His writing matches the descriptions the words convey, always smoothing the story along or butting you into a brand-new totally-unexpected scene in just the right way: you'll understand when you follow the main character and the marquis on their first up-and-over and down-and-through journey of London, which takes you from the muck of the sewers to the roofs of skyscrapers, all without blinking an eye.<br /><br />Stand back from the fantasy shelf of wizards, thieves, warriors and clerics and pick up this intelligent, quirky and unique take on the genre.antasy prose construct\\" and writes easy, flowing sentences.

B003UYUR10|5.0|I really loved this movie.  It had great acting, awesome story, great effects, incredible fight sequences, and a great cast.  I really hope they are putting a sequel together despite the low box office.  I don't know how this didn't do well.  I really wish I would have gone to see it in the theater.
B0000AUHPG|4.0|I saw this when it came out, and understood only the vendetta theme of the film.  Since then, I remembered a few images, in particular the train battle with the boot trick (and on reviewing, I was astonished that it was Jason Robards, one of my favorite actors of all time), but also the background of the boy treated with unimaginably cold cruelty, with the harmonica.<br /><br />It was a great pleasure to watch this as an adult with my kids (well, for bits and pieces, as it failed to capture their attention for long - they have so many other options than to watch what is on!).  I loved the historical theme about the railroads and their ruthless purveyors as well as the brutish henchman-turned-boss.  But best of all were the enigmatic, apparent good guy and his roguish acquaintance - their characters emerge during the film in what can only be called the most subtle cowboy flick that I remember.  Then there is the beautiful tough chick, lately of shady origin in New Orleans (i.e. Cardinale in her prime), who survives to begin to create what could become a new less murderous style of town.<br /><br />However, I do understand why my kids only wanted to watch this in snatches, ever indulgent as they are with the weird old stuff their dad tries to introduce to them.  There are too many slow sequences, with twitching ugly grizzled faces and strange incidents left hanging, which must be connected later by only the most astute viewers.  For me, this adds greatly to the mood and interest, but it doesn't move quickly enough.<br /><br />Recommended.  This is a classic of the genre that I grew up with and that is completely alien to my kids.  It is a great addition to our film library.
0545128285|4.0|J.K. Rowling's The Tales of Beedle the Bard is a brief collection of five yarns that are the wizarding version of fairy tales like Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty:  stories told to children that have a clear moral of what is good and evil.    Rowling's wizarding twist on fairy tales is, like her Harry Potter stories, witty and clever.  To be quite honest, the stories are interesting, but the real highlight is Dumbledore's commentary on each story.  These commentaries manage to snugly fit the stories into the world of Harry Potter when his name is not mentioned even once in the pages of this collection.    Not only is this collection of stories worth picking up on the merits of each of the individual tales (and the subsequent commentary by Dumbledore), but these stories serve to further flesh out the complex wizarding world that Rowling created around Harry Potter.    This transient foray back into Rowling's wizarding world is recommended to anyone who enjoyed her full length novels of Harry Potter.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|There's nobody better than Dylan!  He keeps on touring and bringing it all back to us.  Between following his tours as much as possible,I keep collecting his catalog of music, and Bringing It All Back Home was a great addition to my Dylan collection.
B0011NVC9I|4.0|Well...to start things off, if you are going to to a film based off of a classic story, try to keep the main important parts intact.I understand improvising on certain areas, but the film is about 50% accurate to the original poem/story.    I would love to see a movie version that's true to the story, but hopefully it won't be a Sy Fy Channel exclusive.     Now, if you are watching the movie without any knowledge of the original story, it's very entertaining...worth seeing for the SFX & decent story. Neil Gaiman co-wrote the screenplay, so right there it should tempt you to see it.    I won't give too many spoilers away, but it does have some Pagaism & Christianity in it. To me, I took the story as an end to the Paganism & embracing Christianity in the old Norse world...but this version of the film make make you see it differently.    All in all, it is what it is...entertainment.
0061433047|5.0|Terry Pratchett, one of my all-time so-and-sos, is at it again, demonstrating neither rust nor let-up. I SHALL WEAR MIDNIGHT is the fourth (and final?) outing for the young sensible witch Tiffany Aching, and she's bordering on sixteen now (we first met her when she was nine). Tiffany has been steadily climbing up my list of favorite Discworld characters. Currently, she ranks right behind Death, Commander Vimes, and Susan Sto Helit (Death's grand-daughter). I've liked Tiffany from the moment she ka-blanged a faery queen with an iron frying pan.<br /><br />One of the things that makes Tiffany Aching special is that she wasn't a born witch. She became one by whit of gumption, determination, and doses of the clever and the common sense (and, I guess, a bit of magical talent). Terry Pratchett's Discworld witches aren't the glamorous sorts, certainly not Granny Weatherwax or Nanny Ogg. Young Tiffany has become the witch of the Chalk, caring for the villages on the Chalk, and there's no flash to her game. She makes her rounds and she does all the little things that need doing, whether it's doling out salves for the injured or clipping the toenails of an aged, decrepit woman. Tiffany is practical. She brooks no nonsense. She takes no guff. The people of the Chalk treat her with respect but because she is, after all, a witch (she's got that pointy hat and all), they're not entirely comfortable when she's around. Tiffany takes this all in, and on the surface she demonstrates cool equanimity. But there's a tiny part of her, removed from the grime and the practicality and the what has to be done, that occasionally wonders about the other, more frilly things in life. Tiffany Aching has never had much of a childhood.<br /><br />Hello, dichotomy. Witches are perceived as wise women whom the villagers turn to for advice or remedies. Witches are regarded as evil, cackling hags. Terry Pratchett attempts to sort out these two different perceptions, and of course how he does it is amusing and plot-servicing and thought-provoking.<br /><br />Maybe a bit of SPOILERIZING now:<br /><br />Good deeds will sometimes catch you up, and if that sounds ominous, yer darn tootin'. In WINTERSMITH, Tiffany kissed Winter and so saved the world. But this bold act gains her the attention of a vile supernatural thing, this \\"man\\" with no eyes called the Cunning Man, and the Cunning Man seeks to inhabit her body. Tiffany is told: \\"Every few hundred years or so, suddenly every one thinks witches are bad.\\" The Cunning Man, like a bad penny or navel crust, will turn up every few centuries, and when he does, a witch must face him down. The Cunning Man's influence turns the people against their witch; he inspires that good old mob mentality and the torches and the pitchforks. In this era, it's Tiffany Aching's turn to stand against him. Powerful witches have converged to lend her advice and moral support. If Tiffany can't get the job done - if the Cunning Man possesses her - these witches will try to kill her.<br /><br />Of the four Tiffany Aching novels, I like this one best, after THE WEE FREE MEN. Even more so than the other three, I SHALL WEAR MIDNIGHT is a coming-of-age story, with our young witch truly shouldering an adult's responsibilities, caring as she does for the villages on the Chalk. Pratchett, himself born out of an impoverished village, informs us quietly and convincingly of village life, its culture and colors and habits. But then there's a point in the story in which he revisits the sprawling, iffy metropolis of Ankh-Morpork, and it's fun having Tiffany running into other beloved, familiar Discworld characters. I love the City Guard, and to have Tiffany mingle even for just a bit with the likes of Angua and Vimes is like hog heaven.<br /><br />Right up there with the City Guard, in my regard, are the tiny Nac Mac Feegles, those brawling, lying, cursing, cheating, hard drinking, but fiercely loyal wee free men. As always, they crack me up. And it never stops being endearing how so steadfastly they watch over Tiffany, whom they consider their very own big wee hag. Ach, crivens!<br /><br />There's a lot more going to the story, of course. Bunch of layers to peel. Not to bring up the big elephant in the room - or is it the four meteor-pocked elephants perched on the cosmic turtle in the room? - but how many more books does Terry Pratchett have in him? Many, many more, I hope. If this turns out to be the last Tiffany Aching novel, then it's a good one to go out on. Our girl even gets a well-deserved crack at a happy ending. I SHALL WEAR MIDNIGHT is very highly recommended. Read it. Grin. Ponder. Savor. Squint at the footnotes (they're worth reading).ops being endearing how so steadfastly they watch over Tiffany, whom they consider their very own big wee hag.

B002LFPAUC|5.0|One of the funniest series ever on TV--in ANY country (that I've seen, anyway!) Cleese is brilliant--even though I've seen each of these episodes many, many times, I always find something new and funny in them. Poor Basil Fawlty--the precursor of such sad sack schlubs as Larry David and Michael Scott on the American \\"Office\\". Don't miss this--especially at this price!
B003R0LBVW|3.0|At first I was only going to rate this book 2 stars. Its mostly about people and their every day screwed up lives. Kind of boring actually until I got to the last chapter. I must admit though. the very last sentence brought a tear to my eye. 3 stars for that
B001BMKOZW|5.0|The album was perfect. At first I was not used to the stylistic difference's to system of a downs Cd's. But now I prefer style to that of SOAD. Release a new CD please.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|I hate that the publisher is gouging us for this Kindle book. However, it is a well-written book, one I can't seem to put down. It deserves credit as such, no matter what the price-setters do. Don't punish the author.
B003Y3BMFW|5.0|Great collection! I'm a longtime fan and this is a well put together set. The bonus DVD is awesome. I love all the old music videos! This is NOT an album of new material so do some research before you buy and don't give this amazing set a bad review because you are too much of an idiot to know what you are buying! keep on rockin in the free world....
0312600844|4.0|I've been trying to read authors I might have written off in the past for various reasons.  Joyce Carol Oates was the first I tried after resisting her for years for reasons I can't even remember, and now I can't imagine missing out on her novels.  I must be mellowing in my old age.  But I hadn't heard of Jonathan Franzen until I saw stories popping up on Huffington Post that gave the impression he was a pompous ass.  They weren't that direct but that was the implication.    I saw an interview in the London Telegraph online and read it - he came across as quiet, reserved and seemingly with good reason since some comment he made about being chosen for Oprah's book club for his last book, The Corrections, seemed to be taken as nothing but an insult by Oprah and the media.  He seemed very careful in the interview but respectful and not full of himself.  I saw a clip of him on PBS's The News Hour and again, he seemed like a regular guy and not the arrogant prick I was expecting.  So instead of passing on him like I would have once upon a time, I bought Freedom and started reading it right away.  I loved the way it drew me in by giving me neighbors' gossip about the Berglund family and then moved into their first-person perspectives.  All the characters were complex and flawed but multidimensional and ultimately caring about one another.  (I also appreciated that Midwesterners are represented as complex human beings and not simpletons or rubes!)    It's definitely a novel about characters more than plot lines but there are plenty of unexpected events I did not see coming.  It's also very perceptive about the world we're living in right now, the hysterical political climate, fervor for and against protecting the environment, the Iraq war, the ridiculousness of Apple-mania (which I appreciated).  But those are not the focus - they help to illuminate aspects of the characters but the issues are treated respectfully.  I usually read before bed because it helps me go to sleepbut many times I ended up staying up later than I planned because I couldn't put the book down!  The writing style isn't pretentious or flowery but the conversations are very real and I felt I could picture this world and all the people in it.  Was it the novel of the century?  No, not to me, but it is a really, really good read.  It might be frustrating for people who haven't known anyone who has suffered from depression, but as someone who did myself and sees family members suffering, it's painfully accurate.  I'm glad I read it - I will definitely try The Corrections next.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|Let Me In Is Probably one of the Bigger surprises I've had this year. I', a HUGE Movie buff anymore and I got and see constant movies all year long. If it crosses my mind to see it sometime chances are I will. Let Me In was one of the movie I had no one to go with me so I just went myself. I went and saw the movie expecting good things because Let The Right One In Was in essence a good film. But Let Me Tell You. I was literally blown away, by the feel of this film. Crawling back to the theatre a couple times to see it again. (Yeah it's that good) THe Two Lead Roles (Owen And Abby) are delivered by Chloe And Schmitt is such a flawless way that you would expect them to have been acting for longer than a decade. The feel of the movie leaves you hopeful and touched. Even a heart of stone would soften a little for this film. The Chemistry between Abby and Owen grows at a slow, but much needed rate during the film. And Even the silent parts in the film hit home. Watching their relationship blossom, ad watching the bloody exchanges as previewed only dd more much needed tension to the film, while avoiding certain elements that would mae the movie seem otherwise inaccessable to the mainstream Audience. Let Me In delievers powerful preformances and a Wonderous Storyline to be experienced again and again. Thewait for it to be a Jewel in my collection will be a long wait indeed.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|Seriously. If you don't have this album, you need to buy it now. This is one of the most incredible albums I have heard for awhile. I was in a bit of a music slump and a friend told me about Florence + the Machine. I instantly fell in love with this girl's style/lyrics/music/etc. Wow. I was truly blown away so original. When I first bought this album, it was the only thing I listened to for the whole week and then some. I just couldn't believe I had never happened upon this girl before. I could go on; it's just a musical masterpiece. I will be very interested to see what she comes out with next. But as for this album, I can't just recommend a few songs -- just buy the whole thing, really. You won't regret it.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Once in a while a movie comes along that manages to encapsulate an entire subset of human experience within 2 - 3 hours of on-screen entertainment.  The Ten Commandments with Charleton Heston is a good example of such a film, along with Gandhi and Ben Hur.  I would put Avatar into this discussion, as it is that great of a movie.  The plot is simple enough; in the far future mankind has discovered a planet rich with a valuable resource.  Mankind has sent its military to acquire this resource.  The military funds a science research program whose goal is to convince the natives of planet Pandora to quietly step aside so they can mine this resource.  Known as unobtanium, this resource cannot be breathed or ingested, and instead looks like a cross between oil and coal, and hence I assume is needed by mankind's corporations.  One of the military gradually switches sides and leads the natives in a successful uprising that defines the movie's climax and probably accounted for most of its budget.    The greatness of this movie lies in three things.  First, it creates a world that is the most unique, complete, believable and original setting since the planets seen in the original Star Wars trilogy.  A lot of other movies have created entire worlds from scratch, such as the LOTR and Narnia movies, but none have so completely created a believable ecosystem of plants, animals and different environments in which predator and prey interact like they do on Earth.  Second, the depiction of the fictional Nav'i race is astounding.  From their courtship rituals to initiation rites to social structure and so on, its as if James Cameron hired a crew of anthropologists and sociologists to work on this movie.  Third, this is the first and only American movie I have seen to clearly and completely illustrate the following principle: scientific research is set by military policy, which in turn is driven by corporations, which in turn is focused on the acquisition of non-renewable resources.To be able to pull this off in a Hollywood dominated by the Pentagon is quite an accomplishment, and by itself makes this movie worth the money and time to watch.
B000W1586S|5.0|I honestly can't believe it has taken me this long to get/listen to this album fully. Wow. I was definitely blown away. Incredible. I'm late into the game I know, but so glad I finally got into this game. If you have still not discovered the Killers Hot Fuss for yourself, it is definitely worth taking the time and money to get this album and give it many, many listens.
B003EYVXSW|2.0|The previews looked so fun! But this movie actually repulsed me. It's morally uncomfortable to see egotistical scientists clone anything in a movie, let alone a human-animal clone, but then to have sex with it! My skin was crawling. If there was a moral message of some kind in this movie, it escaped me.
B000T5O48U|2.0|...and that's all I'm gonna say about this movie. I have always had a hard time hating the dog or being scared of it. It looks too cuddly and cute. You can totally tell that it is just sitting there, being told to grunt, but that in real, all he wants is just a bone and a hug. They should have picked something like a black Doberman or something or some other kind of beast. But a little cute Saint Bernhard? Speaking of miscasting for a role. I really wanted to like this movie, but because of their choice of dog I couldnt and if anything, it just upset me to see this dog be artificially made to look evil and be all bruised etc. The whole time I was thinking \\"awww\\". So good idea, wrong dog. If the audience wants to schmuse with it, it will not be scared of it.
