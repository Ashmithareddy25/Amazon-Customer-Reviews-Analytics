B00BAXFCPO|4.0|Lots of good information which has made me cut down on carbs!  However, I think moderation is the answer to eating in general.  I wouldn't give up oatmeal for example!  No absolute scientific proof that I won't get dementia if I give up carbs!  I think most people know sugar is not good for us.  Still an interesting and informative read!
B00000DQYS|1.0|O.k., you should be aware that this record sucks.  The song &#34;Coming Up&#34; is on here in studio version (it was the live version that became a single) and it is a really good song.  But that's it.  Really.  Even 'Waterfalls' which Paul has said more than once is one of his favorite 'lost' tunes (and which must have influenced the TLC song of the same title) is a dud.  To be fair to Mr. McCartney there is a lot of experimenting going on and he earned the right to do that occasionally (and who knows he might have learned something by the process).  But this is frankly almost unlistenable.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've been using this app for more than a year,  first in my kindle fire then in my samsung phone. The interface is very intuitive. I love that it has so many options like setting the day, tone, vibrate or not,  and repetitions. I also love that i can save practically unlimited alarms for different days and events. Another plus is the dark background. I am currently on night shift so snoozing or stopping it in the dark doesn't blind me.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|Classic Hitchcock tongue in cheek suspense.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|Insightful look at conditions in North Korea affecting individual families.  On this level, the cruelty and depravity of leadership there should more fully alert the world to the dangers of isolated, controlling, rogue governments
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|Amazing accessory for the Ipad. Took this down to Brazil from the US and it worked flawlessly. Definetely recommend getting 'G Player' for ipad with it.  G Player will find this device on Wifi as a UPNP media server and allow you to play all video types directly from the SD/USB cards. Only complaint is mine was used so I dont know how strong the battery is, but mine only lasts about 2 hours with the USB stick installed and streaming a 700mb Divx file. I have an external USB battery charger, and on my flight back I just kept it connected to that and it ran for 6+ hours without issue! (New Trent 10000mah battery pack)
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This is a great book regardless if you are into zombie books/movies. Well written and great plot changes with quick character development with all those \\"interviewed.\\"  Completely different from movie.
B002GHHHKQ|5.0|We have been hunting for this movie. We enjoyed it and liked adding it to our collection. It arrived as described.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I think the strongest element of this book was its visual. the images write do rich I could practically taste them. everything else on the other hand was a little lack luster for me. I was expecting a battle of wit and magic to almost epic proportions, but this battle turned into more of a chess game. I was also expecting a sweeping love story, but instead the love seemed to develop out of nowhere. Based on the blurb I was also expecting action, which was nowhere to be found. I liked it over all but it wasn't a great piece of literary fiction. Hence the average rating.
0553807919|5.0|Dr. Daniel Siegel writes in a manner that is easy to read, understand and apply. The skills contained in this book are a great way to look at parenting whether you have a child who has experienced trauma\neglect or a child who has not had any of those life events. This is my go to for easy to apply skills when working with parents.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is one of the best ever, Stephen King you are the man! I love how you took use thru the life of young Danny Doc Torrence, then we see how he turns his life around . We meet new friends and some enemies that will chill you to the bone. You the reader will have a hard time putting this book down. A page turner from Beginning  to end. I recommend this book highly.
B002O3Z50G|5.0|This was a surprise for my wife. We both enjoyed adding it to our collection. I arrived as described. Thank you.
B00GHJ6BJW|3.0|I have been a long time fan (and defender) of Lady Gaga.  My friends make fun of me for listening to her which is OK - because I truly believe she is a unique artist and she keeps things interesting without being a snot about it *cough*Madonna*cough*<br /><br />This album just seems like it's been thrown together and overproduced.  The rap, the weird obtrusive dubstep backgrounds... it's just not what I expected.  A few songs almost seem a little too Amy Winehouse'ish with the drug references and raspy low vocal notes.<br /><br />It's not the worst album I've purchased, but it's certainly not what I expected from the Gaga.  I will try to warm up to it, you never know..might grow on me like a rash.<br /><br />One other note - the \\"Applause\\" song is why I bought the album.  I really enjoyed that when it came out.  Great song, more her style... doesn't match the rest of the album.
0786915749|5.0|Arguably the Dragonlance Chronicles series is the greatest adolescent fantasy series ever written. I highly recommend this book and the series for an introduction to great fantasy for adolescents. The themes of good and evil have some depth and the storytelling is superb.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Trying to find another series like the Hunger Games and this one was good. Some of the scenarios are over the top and this latest book definitely has a few. I enjoy the characters including the two lead roles Tris and Four. Their development has been worth the time it took to read the three books. I would recommend this series.
B007R11DKQ|4.0|Very entertaining and well done.  Willing suspension of disbelief was well worth the time. I like the development of the main character.
B00DZV15FU|4.0|There is no need to explain the timelessness of this wonderful classic. I had not read it for decades, and it was a joy to revisit.
B00AG297GK|2.0|The few parts that were funny, were quite clever and entertaining. However, most of it seemed like an Adam Sandler movie. If you like the previews, that's all you really need to see.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The best game I have ever played. I love this game it is so amazing. I definitely recommend this game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like to keep busy and if I have a few moments, I like to get a room or two done. keeps the brain sharp.
0316322407|5.0|Extremely well written.  After hearing Malala's voice in her interviews, it is as if she herself is reading the story out loud.  It definitely is a book that is difficult to put down once I started reading.  Much history and extremely informative in areas of her culture that are not seen on TV.  I highly recommend the purchase of this book, and have found that many of my friends have put it on their wish list for Christmas after seeing the one I purchased.<br /><br />miasmom<br />Waterville, Ohio
B00FX8EY60|5.0|Great Work Out songs, and Motivational... Really gets me feeling great, and energetic. If you are feeling down... Then listen to this... It gives you strength to move on and get going to complete you goals in life!
B001NHNG64|3.0|Good book up until the end. Seemed a little far fetched!! But I still love reading Lee Child's books eps. Jack Reacher.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I got hooked on this series from the first show. I love it. With Amazon Prime, I get to watch all the previous seasons free in HD and with no commercials.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Beautiful story from a beautify young lady.  She is changing the world and this book captures her back-story and the influences in her life as to why she is changing the world.  A must read for all especially young people.  We need more Malalas.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|Great Work Out songs, and Motivational... Really gets me feeling great, and energetic. If you are feeling down... Then listen to this... It gives you strength to move on and get going to complete you goals in life!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is alot of fun, graphics are good and is very interactive, I just recently got this game and am already having a hard time putting it away, I highly recommend this game for horse lovers
B003M70O5O|5.0|I got hooked on this series from the first show. I love it. With Amazon Prime, I get to watch all the previous seasons free in HD and with no commercials.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|All of the Bourne movies (well, the first 3), are done exceptionally well. Great connection with the characters, great acting and cast.<br />Very entertaining.
B00EI2Y4MQ|2.0|This is a good, basic calculator.  I have Panecal Free and use it whenever I need a basic calculator.  However, Panecal Free rotates the screen to landscape for tablets.  But this paid app (except today as a FAotD) doesn't.  I would give this at least 4 stars if it had a landscape mode.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|Matt was better!  The plot is so much different than previous episodes that it is distracting. But it is still, good entertainment.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it! Every time I look for anything on Pinterest it's there along with other choices! Great media for sharing ideas!
B000KQF6X0|5.0|After watching this a million times on Cable, I had to add this to the library.  I think this is one of the best Michael Douglas movies.  The actors were perfect!  The story line was great!  This is a must have.
0804137501|1.0|DISCLAIMER:<br />This is my first review. I've been reading ebooks for nearly 10 years now and i've never written a review. I would just like to say that i'm a real person, not a Amazon bot or a paid reviewer and i'm only writing this because i've never felt so scammed after reading a book before in my life. I feel like I was robbed at gun point.<br /><br />DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED:<br />I was so excited to read this book. I love 37 Signals, Basecamp, Ruby on Rails, David, Jason and the entire team and everything that they make/create, except for this book. I wasted so much of my time waiting to find at least one good part in the book. I kept telling myself maybe if I read more, maybe if I read one more chapter I will find something helpful or relevant to real life business, but alas I did not.<br /><br />THE WORST<br />It felt like I was reading an extremely dry Wikipedia article. None of the information was new. None of the info was helpful. Very dry common sense information. I wonder what possessed Jason Fried to waste so much time copying and pasting dry info from the web and placing it into this book. I wish books were sold in Redbox machines. You should only have to pay a dollar for crap like this. I mean really did anyone get anything out of this book?
B00BDZV9M4|5.0|I was like most of the 1 star viewers at first.  I said to myself wtf is this?? Being my first bought lil wayne album ever i was dissapointed but i gave it another spin and approached it differently. It started to sound better it grew on me. You cant expect a serious topic cd from wayne...it's not his style. at least not right now.he's a rapper that loves to spit very clever bars and just have fun with the beats.dont expect intellectual rap like black star or common. his lyrics are where he shines with dopeness.
B00EI4V3X2|5.0|Opening the box, I was pleasantly surprised to find the headset does NOT feel cheap, unlike a previous set of turtle beaches I had. They're extremely comfortable and the sound quality is superb. Well worth the price.
B00783NWB6|5.0|I love vampire movies and Underworld is at the top!  I can't say enough great things about the Underworld series.  The first one was my favorite, but Awakening, especially in 3D, was the best.  I can't wait to see what follows!!  And you certainly can never hate the Kate!!!
B004UID2LC|1.0|Did not like this.  I immediately deleated it and dowloaded the Droid Youtube Downloader.  This did not suit my needs.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Watched it in theaters, loved it (even with the blinding lens flares and explosiongasms), and wanted a copy. I've never seen the other Star Trek movies or shows so this is my first. I'm a fan of J.J. Abrams and I think he didn't disappoint.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Great action movie and funny too! This is the best Mission Impossible movie out of the series. Great for a date night movie.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I do not know where to get instructions as to what things are for and how to use. It need more in help area.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I do not like the way it shows on my tablet.  It is difficult to manuver through.  I downloaded another one that works much better.  I figure they are updating the apps all the time and honing their abilities.  Time to move on.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|Just what I needed. I was able to import all my old slides. Now I am going to work on my film negatives.
B000008M54|5.0|I love this CD, it has great sound and is worth having in your collection. I put these guys up with the Pogues anytime.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i love candy crush the game i can play it for hours on end and just enjoy myself. plus i love all the different levels of the game.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|I was waiting for this to come out and didn't realize it was available.  I purchased the first season of American Horror Story and this one and now I am awaiting the 3rd season!  Awesome!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I have been playing Castleville on facebook for a couple of years on and off.  I love the game but, it is unstable and I have to refresh the screen constantly.  This version seems much more stable.
B006TTC5JK|5.0|This is a movie that has always been a favorite of mine and I am so glad it is on blu ray. I think classic movies like this need to be shown more. James Stewart gives a child-like performance<br /> and makes you believe that Harvey is actually there. I highly recommend that if you like this review then go and buy this film.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing Book!  Even a year later I still think about it from time to time.  Everyone I know that read it loves it too.  Beautiful and inspiring characters...
B005R32L66|3.0|It is just okay.  You would think that it would be easier to use though, considering the concept of Skype is awesome.  The concept is awesome but the app leaves much to be desired.  Please make it easier to navigate.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I wish that I didn't. Have to wait for the next book.......ha<br /><br />S a surprise ending...great  way to bring some characters in the story line.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The first two parts of the book bored me and it took me forever to finish but the last part of the book was so intense that I read it in 2 days. I didn't know if I would like the ending or not but I actually did. I get why katniss chose peeta but I have always been a fan of gale
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Good idea but you need to have internet connection on your TV which means if you don't have Smart TV,  you need to have some smart blu-ray or DVD player that will connect your TV with internet. Without it, it's of no use.  Also I had to restart the chrome cast multiple times as netflix and youtube apps couldn't connect to the chrome cast. Overall 2.8/5.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|World War Z, good acting, mediocre story line. I prefer OMEGA MAN with Chuck Heston with a similar but more developed story line.
1451666179|5.0|Love the blog, love the book. Allie is hilarious and insightful and I hope she continues to find so much success.
0307237702|3.0|I was just curious. Now more than ever I feel so taken and sorry for America. A whole nation in the ban of a mad man. What a fraud.<br /><br />Bron
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great show, well done once again. It keeps getting better and better and proves there are still good shows on regular TV.
B009PMEEY2|3.0|It's good for passing the time if you got nothing to do. I take it on appointments that expect to be interrupted.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|A surprise that just appeared on my Kindle one day that turned out to be a quick, EASY way to keep my Kindle running speedily!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was hooked from the first puzzle. I stayed up all night became I had to know what was next. Can't wait for more chapters.
B0007939NO|5.0|I had seen this as a local theater production so I thought I'd see how the pros did it!!  Great escape and so old fashioned sweet!!!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Once again. I adore Sons of Anarchy. I never thought I could get so addicted to a show but here I am. I could watch it all day the current season is really fantastic. If you haven't tried it, I'd really recommend it!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a great movie. People of all ages will love it. My family continues to quote it regularly. If you're up for a good laugh along with characters you will love, sit down and watch Despicable Me.
B0007MAJBQ|3.0|Not the fault of the shipper, but  two of the MiniDiscs I purchased were faulty.  They were not accepted by any of my MiniDisc players.
B005898DDO|4.0|It seemed a bit long but for the most part very good.  There was a lot of previously unseen footage.  Enjoyable for Dylan fans!
B0097AX6EQ|4.0|Chickenhawk is the real deal when it comes to chopper flying during Nam - a great insight into the air cav and the cowboys that flew with them.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I purchased this head set for work.  I do IT network and security support which sometimes takes me into a server room which is very noisy.  With this headset I have the freedom to move around and trouble shoot while on phone calls and conference calls, AND still hear the conversations very clearly.  With the noise canceling mic the conference team does not hear all the back ground noise from the server fans.<br /><br />On the personal side, the surround sound is awesome when watching movies.  A must have for on the go people who don't like being tethered down.
B00BOLFRKW|5.0|A great movie about a great man in an interesting time acted by great actors of another time. Nice to come across.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It has everything I NEED...and it's free! It doesn't scare me awake and it has lots of options. It hasn't failed me like others I have tried.
B00ADMYN9E|4.0|Roswell, flying saucers and the man that was there to disseminate all the crash bits and pieces makes for a true believer's bible - and if you are not a true believer then perhaps this book may change your opinion
B0072X2O66|5.0|Wow, these guys are really good.  they are very powerful and tight.  I am looking forward to their next release.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|I read it pretty quickly as it was very entertaining and just a bit over the top.  The main character is like a hot Sheldon Cooper from Big Bang Theory looking for a wife.  Set in Australia, which I didn't realize for a while.  I would recommend this as a fun read.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This was honestly one of the best books that I have read for a while. The characters and setting are amazing. Anyone that loves sci-fi should definitely pick up this excellent novel.
B008JEJNDE|4.0|I had a pair of crocs before and so ordered the same size.  They continue to make it exactly the same.  However, there is a slight difference where it is made.  This one is made in Vietnam and the 12132 Classic RT was made in China.  This one is a hair shorter as I feel it on my left toe.
B008JFUS0U|3.0|This is a very funny and entertaining movie, I would highly recommend it. It doesn't have the emotional punch of the first one, and the theme music is very bland. The rousing theme from the first film is sorely missed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, it is so much fun some of them are hard to get but you do it is great.
B005R32L66|3.0|I downloaded this for a Nabi tablet. The video chat feature would not work correctly.  Overall this is a decent app but not complrtely universal to all systems.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The chief king says such link bing crank such link award were pop look bunch xxx uhh ok no put. Yyjfd f h
1897299214|5.0|The book is a real page turner, simple and eloquent. Tells a very interesting story of the author's travels to a part of the world that is unacceptable to most in a very entertaining fashion. Prior to reading this book I never realized that such great non-finction stories could be communicated this way. Very interesting read,
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Like many (most) of Mr. King's books I hated to have this end. Keep writing the good stuff we are waiting.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|We rented this movie because we really like Olympus Has Fallen. This was a sad disappointment. The acting was terrible, characters were not believable and overall it was not a good movie. Save yourself some money and a few hours of your life.
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|I have loved this series from the beginning.  I still watch it from time to time and it's amazing the things I missed the first time (even the second time) through.
B001BANK32|5.0|I've been a Stephen King fan for a long time, but for some reason, I never made it around to reading The Shining until very recently. After finally reading it, I now understand why it's so popular. This is Stephen King at his finest!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The Good Wife never dissapoints - By far my favorite TV Series.  The entire cast is brilliant and the writing is fantastic!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This fascinating game is for anyone to use.It teaches you and kids to be patient.This is a great game and I think if you like prehistoric creatures and animals this is the game for you.
B008M87GJK|4.0|Love BBC coverage as a refreshing change from CNN which is just too much about videos and the 5 things you need to know for your day,  Why not 5 stars....well, just not sure what makes a news program say wow.
1589949811|4.0|Fun and frustration all at the same time! This game is no walk in the park. The rules are easy enough to master, but the game itself is very challenging; which makes it very re-playable. The easiest of the three scenarios that come with the core set is pretty manageable, especially with two players, but the other two scenarios are much more challenging. The first time I played this with a friend, we beat the first scenario pretty easily. With the second scenario, we lost once and won once. But the third scenario beat us to the ground before we even had a chance to make a dent in the first phase.<br /><br />Playing solo is a lot of fun, but from my experience, it's pointless to try anything aside from the easiest scenario. If you've never played before, I would highly advise playing through a couple solo games before playing with a friend. That way, you'll have a pretty solid understanding of the rules, and the gameplay will go much smoother.<br /><br />I've only played this a few times, but I really like it so far. I can't wait to try out some of the Adventure Packs.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This app works great. It is easy to use and I can't believe how easy it was to install.<br />I installed it on my Gtablet that I upgraded to Jellybean.
B000GWE44U|4.0|It's Jack Nickolson in a well known movie (that I had somehow missed)! We decided to pick this classic to watch on Halloween!
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|Fairly good but nothing spectacular.  I thought the original Conan.. with Arnie was better.  Makeup and special effects were very good.
B002LC8HF0|4.0|This was a very satisfying conclusion to the Mistborn trilogy. From a birds eye view, I really liked the trilogy. The story was great, and the characters were strong. There were a few moments throughout, though, where I was pulled out of the story by writing that seemed a little contrived. There were conversations and scenes here and there that felt a little forced, mostly involving Elend's character, but overall, I really liked the books.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|What is the purpose for this update anyways? It was working fine before and now I can't even open the app.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It has been a long time since I have read Stephen King, I got bored with the writing style.  However, this book is a grabber from start to finish.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|It was cute. Just your typical chick flick. Semi predictable, but sometimes you just need a cute chick flick. If that's the case, this is it.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I was completely enthralled by the end  of the first page! And  the rest of the book didn't disappoint. The writer is very detailed and makes it easy to envision the world the boys are in.
0847835073|5.0|Monica Bellucci is one of the most beautiful and sensual women ever. This book is fabulous. It captures her beauty and sensuality perfectly. I just wish there was a comapnion DVD of her sexy movie moments.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great graphics. Not too obvious. Story line pulls you in so it is not just puzzle after puzzle. I recommend.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|In order to really get into this movie, you have to throw out everything you know about Star Trek history and all the previous series.  If you can make that jump, then the movie is excellent.  But forget everything you knew about Star Trek before you watch.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This sequel to Stephen King's &#34;The Shining&#34; answers the question &#34;what ever happened to that little boy?&#34;  As usual Stephen King writes his characters in a way that you totally understand their feelings and motivations.  The story is intricately woven and comes together in unexpected ways.  Excellent!
B004T6IBNY|4.0|Fun pinball.  Didn't like all the games but really enjoyed it anyway.  Reminds me of the days we used to spend playing games in the malls.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grabbed me from the first word, and ended with a bang. Really thought this was a real John Grisham.<br />Really enjoyed it.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Getting too easy to predict, until the last 5 minutes of the season. It would be great it the whole season was as unexpected.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|First book in the Jack Reacher series.  Great story, and fun to read.  I look forward to reading more in this series.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is awesome it's fun you get to add pony' s  it teaches you to save your money ;)
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Life is not about happy endings, it's about the journey and how you decide to live with the choices that are made by you and by those you love and care for.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It has potential, but is too limited at this time for what you can stream. It only supports a single window at a time to cast. As more and more apps are supported, it will be a go-to device. Right now, it does pretty much the same thing as my DVD player.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This the simplest and most fun game I played. I would recommend it to everyone and getting it for free, is a sweet deal indeed
B00DNDR29I|5.0|I dig this album.  I put it in and just let it play.  Janelle Monae is so versatile and her versatility is displayed in this body of work.  I get jazz, big band, funk, hip hop and R&B all without having to change the cd!!  She has acquired a forever fan!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|\\"A Time To Kill\\" is my all-time favorite movie.  I watch it over and over again.  So I was anxious to read this new book by one of my favorite authors. Legal novels are one of my passions. So I loved this book.  Knowing the background and past history of the characters made it even better.  You could actually picture Mathew McConaughey and Donald Sutherland in the roles.  I found this book to be not quite as exciting as \\"A Time To Kill\\", but great nonetheless.  The ending (the reason for the verdict)is surprising.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and had a hard time putting it down.  I hope it is made into a movie.
B00821OX98|3.0|doesn't quite stand out as super.  not surewhat it lacked.  maybe more chemistry in the romance part.  a bit flat.
1451613512|4.0|New revelations that are not reveled in history classes or generally presented to the public in other forms. The truth is not what is, but what we are told.<br />.
1476727651|5.0|This novel is great. Even if you have not read The Shining.<br />If you have read the Shining its even better. I have already<br />started to read The Shining again.Stephen King has a way<br />of storytelling that no movie can ever match. The Shining<br />with Jack Nicholson is an all time great,but the book is way better.<br />  My advice to get the maximum enjoyment get both books and<br />read them both.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Insanely awesome and very realistic fight scenes between giant robots and monsters! Godzilla films, transformers, dragon ball z, gundham, mech-warrior and martial arts all in one. Plus if you're into dragons, one of the monsters has wings! Super sick.
0316228583|3.0|I generally enjoyed the book, although most of the time it seemed like I was reading a soap opera.  The characters, while reasonably well developed, were so obviously flawed that it was difficult for me to see them as real.  I think that the flaws in most people are more subtile but those flaws can still be very damaging to their relationships with their families and with society.<br /><br />Neverthelless, I think is a pretty good book and would recommend reading it.  I don't think it destined to become a classic and I don't think that we should be comparing JK Rowling to Hemmingway, Steinbeck, Fitzgerald, or Dickens as some have.
B00G9U7R2O|3.0|I liked the movie it was very cute but when watching it it sopped about 5 times and at some of the best parts and one time we had to wait 3 mins for it to start again. Not worth the 5 dollars I had to spend to rent it. I was disappointed. Especially since it was for my kids who have no patience.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I bought the original release when it came out on DVD. Happy to say, the FF7 Complete version is a a lot more graphic and intense in the fighting scenes, especially the ending fight. Overall, it's a big win. The complete version adds on about 10 more minutes of footage, but those 10 mins, especially since it's blu-ray format, makes this CG worthwile.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Didn't work at all.  Tried on three different TV's.  Cheap but no go!  It sounds like a great idea if they get it working.  A cheaper version of Apple TV?

B00D8HNQZI|5.0|It is great for the artist's work.  The delivery was late and you don't get a hi-rez download by buying through Amazon.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Great fun to read. Fast paced and exiting.  The down side is that once again Mr. Martin leaves us hanging, with nothing concluded and everyone in a state of limbo.  I think the author has no idea how to bring the story to a close, and it will go on for ever.  Hope he has someone in line to carry on when he passes on.
B00C7607FS|1.0|The package came when I was very busy and I just let my wife and granddaughter open it without my examining it closely.  When I did look at it (just too late to return it) I realized that I had been sent a DVD only copy and not a blu-ray copy as shown in the advertisement.<br />Okay, okay, it is somewhat my problem for not being more careful about inspecting what was sent me, but we've had wonderful service from Amazon before and I had been lulled into a false sense of security.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it.  Have it on my wifes I-Pad too. She loves playing it as well, so I needed it on the Kindle Fire.
B000V8A95C|5.0|Great, catchy music that I somehow never really get tired of listening to. Good quality MP3s. Would buy the album again.
1423113462|4.0|After finishing the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, the Heroes of Olympus series is the next step. It is a continuation of the stories of the demi-gods at Camp Half-Blood and beyond. I thought it would directly follow the same characters, but this was not the case (as anyone can tell by reading the book's synopsis). Instead we start the story with Jason, who has woken up on a school bus next to a girl who claims to be his girlfriend. He has a bad case of amnesia and though everyone knows him, he has no idea who he is. The guy claiming to be his best friend, Leo, and his girlfriend, Piper, prove themselves to be friends to him quickly when they help him fight some evil storm spirits during a field trip. All three know something is different about them, but they don't know what until they are taken away to Camp Half-Blood and filled in on the whole Mount Olympus in America and godly-parent thing. Meanwhile, our friend Annabeth from the Percy Jackson series is trying to find her boyfriend (Percy), who has suddenly and inexplicably gone missing. With many familiar characters and a whole new problem to figure out, The Lost Hero proves an easy transition into this new series.<br /><br />I wasn't crazy about Riordan's choice to use three points of view in this book. Switching point of view is a difficult task for the writer and the reader as it can easily lead to confusion. However Riordan carries it off well. A few changes were not as clear as they could have been, but otherwise he kept the voices different enough for us to understand and recognize the individual characters. I didn't feel as connected to these characters as I had to Percy, and I think that's because I was trying to focus on three instead of just one. I would say that was the biggest sacrifice when sharing the main character's spot. The back and forth with Roman and Greek names was a bit confusing at times as well. But the story moved well and I wanted to keep reading until the last page. I am moreexcited about the next book as it goes back to Percy's point of view.<br /><br />A note on the audio version: I had listened to the entire Percy Jackson and the Olympians series on audio, but when I tried to do the same with the Heroes of Olympus, I was disappointed. The company switched narrators, and I didn't like the changes the new one instituted. He changed the pronunciation of some character's names slightly (but I found it annoying) and made Annabeth's character sound completely different, which I couldn't get past. She used to be very spunky and he made her sound sad and wistful. I realize she is dealing with worrying about Percy in this book, but it didn't come off in the right way. So I gave up after the first CD and switched to reading the hard copy of this book.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The device is very easy to install and hook up to the laptop. I'd prefer it not have the bright light behind it as it lights up a dark room, but it's a very cool, inexpensive way to painlessly send video signal to a TV.
B007OAAK0O|4.0|I love it but once again I did not like the video quality. I do hope the improve the video quality  with preferably a blu-ray version.
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|I chose this because my grandkids love animals and they laughed their heads off at Puss.  I was very entertained myself.
B00G91WB3S|4.0|This was a great action packed movie with tons of high-tech CGI.<br />A superman movie unlike any before and it has a really good cast of mostly new faces.<br />I especially liked the beginning - the extended showing of Kryptons end and Russell Crowe was great as Jor El. Fantastic sci-fi stuff in the opening ten minutes.<br />And the action just never stops. I usually do other stuff on my computer while watching a movie, but this one kept me riveted right to the end.<br />I'll be watching this movie again and again.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Everyone should own this movie. Why? Quentin Tarantino. Kill Bill Franchise has been one of the greatest things of my generation. A story of a bride getting her revenge on those who betrayed her. Classic.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it you should try it out now and I'm not kidding it gets your grades up to 100 percent!!!!!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Mix an interesting cast of characters into a semi-futuristic space Western and what do you get? &#34;firefly.&#34; Times have changed but people haven't. Those with money and power get all the cool tech, and those who have nothing get to keep nothing. Fortunately for those who have little or nothing, the crew of Serenity, led by Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), will do the right thing.<br /><br />Some of the strange (interesting) things are how little medicine has progressed, how pistols and rifles still shoot bullets, and how unlike in &#34;Star Trek,&#34; there are no transporters or food replicators, although there is space travel and all the technology that goes with it. Being a &#34;companion&#34; is now both legal and a respected profession, and having one associated with a pirate ship like Serenity brings legitimacy and respect to an otherwise bad reputation. Science still insists that the Bible is illogical yet there are still missionaries who try to spread the gospel, and one just happened to board Serenity as a tourist.<br /><br />I find this a quirky yet addictive program.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|This will keep you on the edge of your seat!  Very intense.  Would definitely recommend this to my friends.  Thanks!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The story line breaks down in this third book. I loved the first two, but this one seems forced, like the author lost her vision for writing it. I actually went back and rewrote the storyline in my mind for the last half of the book. Such a let down after the first two were SOOO good.
B004QYTRRS|5.0|From beginning of the film to the end the plot kept you in suspense till the very end!!! Great movie!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This thrilling book, with plenty of twists and surprises will leave you dumbstruck. Gillian Flynn carefully and tastefully creates an intricate plot that is forever changing. Once you finally start to believe something is true, everything is turned upside down again. This book reached the New York Times Bestseller list, becoming Flynn's most successful book.<br />Amy and Nick Dunne move back to Nick's hometown in Missouri after he lost his job in New York City. Both were writers for a living and finding work was tough in Missouri. The married couple gets by on Amy's trust fund from a book that was modeled after her Amazing Amy. Amy's psychologist's parents who created a basically perfect child wrote amazing Amy. This can be traced to the conflict of the story as Amy tries to live up to her double-life foe. She realizes that she is not perfect and it sends her over the edge. \\"It's a very difficult era in which to be a person, just a real, actual person, instead of a collection of personality traits selected from an endless Automat of characters.\\" Amy battled her whole life a personality disorder due to this book. Slowly, Nick finds this out that Amy is not the girl he once meet, and maybe he isn't the man he used to be. Through their pressured marriage, Amy goes missing on their five-year anniversary and all the signs lead to Nick being the killer. Nick has to finish his annual anniversary scavenger hunt to figure out the clues of what exactly happened to his wife. The plot remains riveting until the end where you are left to make your own conclusions.<br />Gone Girl is a very thought-provoking novel that keeps you guessing till the very end. It carries many heavy themes but it's a tasteful twist on murder mysteries. I highly recommend the book. It is a very good selection for bookclub as well. Don't like the length scare you, it's a quick read.

B005KAH7QU|1.0|For months, the preview for Hanna played before everything I saw and to be honest it intrigued me. Unfortunately, it's just one of those film where all the good stuff is in the previews. Hanna is a special girl, wanted by The C.I.A., so since birth, her father hid her in a cabin in the North Pole. He trained her to be an ultimate weapon, to fight the people who sought her out, but as a result she had no idea about how the world worked. The only positive thing I could take away from this film was the performance of Saoirse Ronan, who was simply amazing. At 19, this girl isn't just a martial arts expert, but she speaks like a dozen languages. She is just as special and amazing as the character she was portraying and it's unfortunate that her skills were wasted in such a bomb of a movie. I don't think I've ever seen a slower moving, more boring action film in my life. Nothing is explained to you until much later on and by that point, you just really don't care anymore and want the film to be over. It's just one uncomfortable interaction after another, with seemingly no point, until the films disappointing climax. The actress was really talented and they could have done so much more with her, instead of putting her in a film, where she's running around like a chicken with her head cut off. I mean really, the story could not have been more thin and the supporting cast couldn't possibly have been any less helpful to the story. Hanna has an interesting star, but is ultimately a complete waste of time.
1455525839|4.0|With Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child's thirteenth Agent Pendergast adventure being a stand-alone tale, and one that begins with his prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, Corrie Swanson, taking center stage, I wasn't sure quite what to expect. Fortunately, White Fire proved to be everything we've come to expect from the man in black . . . and then some.<br /><br />As it turns out, having Corrie take the lead was a smart move. The events of the Diogenes Trilogy (dealing with his brother) and the Helen Trilogy (dealing with his wife) revealed a bit too much of our enigmatic detective, removing much of his mystery. Having seen him at his very darkest, confronted by the very human sort of concerns and conflicts from which he once seemed so far removed, it's nice to have him step back a bit and once again resemble the odd sort of hero we first came to know and admire. That's not to say Preston and Child have rolled back time or forgotten his suffering - there are some glimmers of emotion here that are quite powerful - but they've allowed him to regain his composure and rebuild the walls of his personality.<br /><br />As for Corrie, she's a very different sort of protagonist, but likable despite her flaws. She's impetuous, headstrong, and rebellious . . . a typical college student. Her attitude gets her into a lot of trouble, and while some readers may accuse Preston and Child of exploiting that fiery defiance to create some of the novel's tension, there's nothing that is out of place for her character. We, as readers, may know it's never a good idea to ignore Agent Pendergast's advice, but when your education and your future career are on the line, in jeopardy of being overshadowed by a man of such legendary stature, you can't fault Corrie for her actions.<br /><br />As for the plot, there are really three story lines here that slowly converge over the course of the novel, revealing the extent to which they're connected. The 19th century forensic mystery that forms the basis of Corrie's thesis is probably the most unsettling of the three, pointing as it does to some very grotesque criminal behavior among the miners of the time. The contemporary mystery of the murderous arsonist is far more sensational, with some incredibly horrifying scenes of callous torture that rival anything we've seen before, but it's tainted by the times. We've come to expect that kind of violence - we see it every day in the news, or on television at night. While the events of 150 years ago aren't quite as sensational, they must be considered in the context of the time . . . a time in which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself could hardly believe the news.<br /><br />That brings us to the third story line, that which pulls everything together. Having heard the true story of what happened from Oscar Wilde, Doyle wrote one last Sherlock Holmes story on the subject, but it was rejected as being far too horrific for Victorian sensibilities. It falls to Agent Pendergast to investigate the situation and track down that 'lost' story, which provides him with the clues to solve the case. Not only do Preston and Child incorporate Doyle as a character, but they set out to write that 'lost' tale, with the approval of Doyle's estate. It's a very Hound of the Baskervilles type story that they include here, serving as both an homage to the man who inspired Pendergast, and as a solid story all on its own.<br /><br />As for how it all concludes, the final pages of White Fire contain the same kind of breakneck pacing, twists, turns, and betrayals we've come to expect from the series. There's one scene I thought was a bit of a cheat, with the big reveal something we couldn't have easily anticipated, but looking back I can see the clues that at least suggested the possibility. Corrie comes off as a legitimate heroine in her own right, with a terrifying flight through rattlesnake infested old mining tunnels that is Indiana Jones worthy. As for Pendergast, he is very much the hero of old, restoredand rejuvenated, and passionate once again about a mystery for the sake of a mystery.<br /><br />While I wouldn't count it in my top three Agent Pendergast adventures, it was still a great read, and one that deserves its place on the holiday bestseller lists. Yes, Agent Pendergast is back in fine form in White Fire. Fans will not be disappointed, and new readers will find this an easy entry point into the series.ated, and passionate once again about a mystery for the sake of a mystery.<br /><br />While I wouldn't count it in my top three Agent Pendergast adventures, it was still a great read, and one that deserves its place on the holiday bestseller lists.

B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Ever since the movie Flight came out, people have been raving about it, but I didn't understand why until I actually sat down to watch it. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors, so I was going to see it either way, but I wasn't expecting it to be what it was. The previews and commercial all focused on the crash and the hero who made an impossible move to land the plane safely, but in reality that's just a small part of the movie. The true focus of the movie is on the troubled life of pilot, Whip Whitaker (Washington), whose demons seem to find him wherever he goes. When he's in the air, Whip is at peace and away from a life of hardship and disappointments, but after the crash, he's unable to fly and has to face that life head on. The film itself was actually a bit slow after the thrilling introduction and the excitement on board the plane. At parts during this film, I was bored, but it's necessary to bring the story together into an unexpected conclusion. Sometimes, a film is slow and it's just not worth it to sit there, but Flight is different. The film may lack something in the middle, but it is well worth you're time. The story is out of this world and Denzel Washington shows that he hasn't lost a thing. This man brings such a strong presents to everything that he does, that often times I find myself overlooking the entire rest of the cast. There are a lot of big names in this film, that all become forgettable after the performance Washington gives. Even though this film came out at the wrong time, if he doesn't receive the Academies attention for this role, then there is a gaping flaw in their system. The story is fantastic, Denzel Washington is nothing short of amazing, and this story will stick with you long after the film is over, I can not recommend it enough!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This Kindle version of Facebook is awful. When you click on someone's picture or in any way leave the timeline, when you go back you are at the beginning of the timeline again and it goes through this laborious process of scrolling itself back to where you were. It's so irritating, but I guess Facebook doesn't care about Kindle.
1605092762|3.0|Mr. Polak's work is impressive and inspiring, but the story he tells repeats itself.  Such a powerful idea and lifework should have been captivating.  I am inspired and impressed by Mr. Polak's life work, but it took me a while to get through the book.  I still recommend reading this book, but mainly because I agree with his ideas on eradicating poverty.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|The story is extremely captivating, the contradiction between appearance and reality makes for an unforgettable experience. Actors, TV stars, are thrust into becoming the characters they portrayed.
B00BGI076M|4.0|The Following is the Spring sensation that took Fox viewers by storm and led to some of the highest ratings for a mid-season debut in network history. After watching one episode, I could see why this show was so popular, it really is right up my ally, and is easily one of the best written shows on network television.<br /><br />10 years ago, College professor, Joe Carroll (James Purefoy), was convicted of the murders of 14 young women. He sits on death row, waiting to be executed, when he launches a daring escape. Completely stunned, the F.B.I. brings in the now retired agent who originally caught him to track him down. Ryan Hardy (Kevin Bacon) is a troubled, lonely man, who just wants to move on with his life and leave all the horrors he's known behind him. Reluctantly, he agrees to find Carroll and to everyone's surprise, does it with ease. As it turns out, getting caught again was all part of Carroll's plan. While in prison, Carroll had spoken with and gotten to know many different people who admire what he did. The charismatic killer has tricked these people into believing that they need to give their lives meaning by being a part of something special, his resurrection. Carroll's getting easily captured by the F.B.I. was nothing more than a signal to his many followers to begin reeking havoc all over the eastern seaboard. The targets are seemingly anyone Carroll ever interacted with and the acts all meant to torment the man who caught him, Ryan Hardy. With no other choice, Hardy agrees to stay on and try to stop whatever was set in motion, before Carroll's plan can come to fruition.<br /><br />I know what you're thinking, because I was thinking the same thing. It's a great story for one season, but how in the world can they continue this show after that, without it becoming old and repetitive. It was something I thought a lot about while watching this show, however my doubts may have been premature. The more this show continued, the better the writing got, and if anyone can keep this show interesting and fresh it's this talented cast and crew.<br /><br />Kevin Bacon has always been a tremendously underrated actor, because for 30 years, he's simply been known as that guy from Footloose. I've seen many of his films and now his new TV show, and I have to tell you this guy is phenomenal. It wasn't just being able to pull of the character of Ryan Hardy, but also the chemistry he had with James Purefoy. Joe Carroll is one of the best villains I've seen since Hannibal Lechter and the chemistry Purefoy has with Bacon, easily rivals that of Hopkins and Foster.<br /><br />The show is made even stronger by a tremendous support cast of complicated characters, all of whom have their own hidden past and issues that are brought to the table. Movie actor, Shawn Ashmore is terrific as the young agent who wants nothing more than the praise of his idol, Ryan Hardy. The boss is played by Annie Parisse, perhaps best known as A.D.A. Alex Borgia on Law & Order.<br /><br />This show really has deep, well developed characters, that you get quickly attached to, and every time you think you know what's coming they throw a curve ball at you. The Following is such a strong story, that is so well written, that it really has the chance of being on the air for years.<br /><br />Season one is now streaming on Netflix and season two debuts on Fox in January. I really can't wait to get there. Rarely do I watch shows on the air, I prefer to wait for the DVD to avoid the commercials and watch as much or as a little as I want. The Following is different though, because this show was just so amazing to me, that I honestly can't wait to see what season two has in store for me. I am more than willing to sit through the commercials in order to get there that much faster, and I think once you've seen this show, you'll feel the exact same way.

B007THA4FI|5.0|JK Rowlings is an excellent author, perhaps inspiring.  Everything about this book worked.  The basic premises are unsual but  believable.  Her character development works gradually and seamlessly with moments of shrewd insights.  She makes nuanced observations of economic and social class that perhaps reflect personal learning from living in both poverty and great wealth.  I hope she keeps writing...I find I am waiting for her next book the way my kids and grandkids waited for the next Harry Potter book.

B00DC7NNAC|5.0|Very good movie. Would watch it over and over again. Sat through the whole movie from the beginning to the end.
B001J1K5IG|5.0|This is an interesting epic take on the Earp legend. One thing that makes it intriguing is that it's just different enough from Tombstone, another great Earp epic, to merit watching and rewatching. Costner's Earp is colder, harder and fatalistic than we're used to seeing, and that's grimly effective. I enjoy Costner in any film about the West or baseball, so sit back and have a good time with this one.

B008NCSZQ8|3.0|Personally, I prefer the movie \\"Thor\\" more than this film, but I am someone who prefers story and character development over explosions.  This film is a lot of fun and there are some funny moments as well.  The incredible hulk looked GREAT in this movie.  They didn't just make him some computerized affect like in the hulk movies. Here he looks almost real.  Some issues I had were that the Hulk is a little too cognitive sometimes (he's not supposed to be able to think all that straight once he turns);  Though the black Widow's skimpy dress in the beginning makes perfect sense, the pants she wears while in command briefing are way too tight and the butt shots while she's speaking with Loki were a little too obvious; Loki looks pale and sick at the start of the film (probably because he's been tortured by the Citari, but it's never clear)...  In any case, this is still one of the better superhero films out there.  There is a lot of action, but not a whole lot of story and barely any character development.
B00AEFYSEA|5.0|Magnificent. Superlative. Memorable and sweeping in its scope. Good performances. Just get over the dubbing or voice overs and you may agree this is the best western ever. Well maybe not but you will not forget it once you see it.
B00FG5FRG6|2.0|A &#34;choose your own romance&#34; movie that's ashamed of it's genre, so it gilds itself in a lot of futurism mumbo-jumbo. Some magical moments, but certainly not worth the ride.

044654759X|5.0|The book was in perfect condition, received before expected.  I really loved the book Best of Me by Nicolas Sparks and I am sure that Safe Haven is just as good.  I can't wait to read it.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Struggling with 2 Stars (It was okay) or 3 Stars (Like It). I think I will go with 2, because I have a feeling the more I think about it...it will be 2 Stars.<br /><br />I LOVED the first book and the second book. This book I felt like the author got lost. There was so many things she tried to add when they \\"went outside of the fence\\" that not a whole lot really was developed. The split story-line also didn't really do what was going on inside the fence a whole lot of justice either. I continued to read, hoping I would still enjoy the conclusion to this series, that I have recommended to several people. Only to be disappointed, like I really want to throw my Kindle across the room (still resisting the urge). Even as I continued to read, I kept thinking this has to be wrong, the author will redeem herself, only it DID NOT HAPPEN! The final wrap up chapters drove me crazy as well. I felt like she tried to cram every little thing in there, like when you watch a movie and during the end credits they give you little snippets of where everyone is at.<br /><br />If you loved the first two books I actually recommend you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! Hope for some fan-fiction or something or just come up with a solution on your own.<br /><br />I'm just so disappointed right now. I can think of so many ways the story-line in this book could have been developed.
B008V8FVTI|5.0|In following the storyline, you see how well the movie was made and showed life in that era in that neighborhood. Friends for life. Friends and mentors sticking their necks out for one another in spite of the law.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Love it!  Impressive features.

Yes, that was what was slowing me down.  I found an awesome website that offers online, easy to understand, with screen shots, tutorials where I am now loving my kindle even more!  The PDF portion of the app actually saved us from missing a serious deadline just last week - which I hadn't even looked at prior to moments before I was relying on it.

B002ZG99A4|5.0|There's something astonishing about poor reviews of this film, as if it was supposed to be something it's never promised to be in the first place. Even if you already know the premise, all you have to do is ask yourself one staggeringly easy question:<br /><br />Do you want to see Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, and Dolph Lundgren in the same fighting scene?<br /><br />If yes: Awesome, you have nothing to worry about, and don't even bother with what anyone else says. I typically see two sides to every argument, but in this case, they're wrong. There is no room for debate. If no: What the hell else could you want from a film that appeals exclusively to an audience that wants to see that? What are you even thinking? What else could you possibly expect even from looking at the damned posters?<br /><br />Films with very specific purposes like these are something neither critics nor users can seem to figure out. They've never been able to get it, and seem to run under this assumption that the film should be \\"more\\" than what it's ever said it would be. This is the exact equivalent of going to watch Commando and going \\"This is stupid.\\" No, no it isn't, you're just stupid for thinking it was ever going to be anything else, idiot. You already know what the film is. The only thing you really have cause to worry about is if any of the actors present get particularly shafted and aren't even central to the film (see: Many other action films that promised this and just didn't do it, constructing the trailers literally out of the only footage they know people will pay to see), and that isn't a problem here. Everyone's got their place, and it all works out like you *should* freaking expect.<br /><br />If you didn't like this movie, you were never supposed to like it in the first place. The film never promised you a rose garden, for a tongue-in-cheek literature joke. If you don't even get that joke, then you should never review anything, ever again, because you don't evenknow what you like or why you like it.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game very addictive but it so much fun to play I love how it challenges you on every level
B009MF56GC|5.0|Look, the appeal of this film could not be any more obvious. But if you're somehow, for whatever psychotic reason, on the fence about seeing it, just read this paragraph and answer the question that follows:<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone, Chuck Norris, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Jason Statham, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce Willis walk into a room with lots of things that can explode. They shoot everything in the room while cracking amusing one-liners at each other, quite a few in-jokes, and totally absurd noise and action. Jean-Claude Van Damme has a one-on-one showdown with Stallone at one point.<br /><br />I just described exactly what the point of this movie is in three sentences. There is nothing else that needs to be said. So, ask yourself, does this scenario appeal to you, or are you of such astoundingly poor judgment that you expected something different, much in the same way someone looking at a clear day would expect a sky colored something other than blue? If yes, great. Ignore everyone else and go see it, you'll be entertained. If not, you're so narcissistic you never would have liked this film to begin with at any point, and your ego is eating itself if you give this film a poor review on grounds it never promised in the first place.<br /><br />The only real problem in this film is that it's lacking in the Jet Li department. Which is really unfortunate, as he was great in the first one. Not sure what happened there, but he's not around for most of the film, which sort of sucks. So if you're here to see Li and to not see him would make you cry regardless of anything else, you should not watch this film.<br /><br />That's as deep as it goes. If you saw it by choice, then you expected correctly what the film was going to deliver all along. If you expected differently, short of being deceived by someone else who lied about what the COVER was about, then it's very likely that you're suffering from a severe psychosis and could benefit from treatment. You're also probably a harsh critic of the Transformers films and referred to them as \\"dumb action flicks\\" as an insult. This is an added indication that you should never review anything, ever again, because you've failed to develop the basic cognitive ability to know that people can enjoy exactly those films, and your opinion on movies may as well be a review on how provolone cheese is better than Swiss cheese. It's just as valid, really.
0802473156|5.0|This is a well written book.  Easy to understand, and very helpful.  I am a therapist and recommend it to my clients regularly.  There are self assesments, and guides couples and families into heartfelt conversations about how they can connect to one another and work through conflicts through use of Love Languages.  I have seen decreased conflicts and renewal in marriages through the use of this book.

B00EU9VCKO|5.0|I found this app kind of fun to play with.  It has a lot of utilities for adjusting your pictures, but the one I find the most useful is it will resize the photo on my phone.  For some reason on my Motorola Razr HD it takes huge pictures and there is no way to limit this.  Then if I want to e-mail it takes awhile and uses a lot of data from my data package (unless I'm home and on Wi-Fi).  With this app, I can shrink the photo size so I can e-mail it if I wish--this feature alone is of value to me.
B004VOBIE8|5.0|Well thought out, easy to use.  I'm able to find the files I use quickly and without delay.  Allows me to separate files I use most.

B004DM1ZQY|4.0|This is a typical backgammon game.  I got it because I like to play backgammon.  I tried playing it on my phone, but I guess my fingers are too fat, I had a hard time touching the pieces to move them.  After a game I gave up on this.  It is really not a limitation of the game, more than likely it's my phone. I think on a tablet it would work much better.

B00EI2Y4MQ|1.0|This calculator fails the square root tests and also if you edit the input and then scroll back you will still see ghosts of what you input before. In other words, it loses track of itself pretty quickly. This is nowhere near ready for prime time as a paid app especially when there are lots of free ones that blow its doors off.<br /><br />I'm sorry but I cannot find more than 1 star to give this because the application is very half-baked. I feel like the developer actually has some nerve to charge for this and I also have to question Amazon for choosing this as a free app of the day.
B00DYEN5QU|1.0|First, it should be stated Henry Cavill is great as Superman.  Russell Crowe is quite good as Jorrel.  That being said, the first half of the movie had great potential to be something really worth watching.  Then the explosions and battles started.  Nonsensical, CGI gorged, battles which added little except the opportunity to have something to display in 3D.  The movie seemed like a blend of Independence Day meets War of the Worlds, only without the plot. At what point does the military stop shooting and firing explosives when it becomes obvious they have no affects on the enemy?  Apparently, in this movie, never.  And at what point does a viewer get tired of watching 2 indestructible enemies throw each other through buildings?  These fight scenes seemed endless and worthless.  The movie was also about 45 minutes too long. Very disappointing!  Cannot recommend this one.  Hopefully the sequel will have about 75% less CGI.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Excellent series. From costumes to story line, all aspects are captivating. I am addicted to this wonderful historical drama series.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Fabulous movie I loved it. If you loved the Lord of the Rings movies then you will be so excited to see beloved characters of Frodo, Ian Holm as older Bilbo, Gandolf, Galadriel, Elrond, Gollum and Martin Freeman who is amazing as younger Bilbo.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|To start with, I am a Die Hard fan.  I have been well entertained by most of the previous chapters of this film saga but clearly A Good Day to Die Hard is the weakest of this very entertaining series.  Storyline was weak and Bruce didnt seem to have the same motivation he displayed in the previous films.  Using the angle of helping his son as a means to attract a younger audience was a good idea that was not done properly.  The story was barely believable and lacked the vitality of the prior ones.<br />I will still be a Die Hard fan but hope that they find better ways to test the mettle of John McClane.

One of my new favorites the fight scenes are great and hilarious. I love Kieran Culkin, Knives and Ramona and the music is great too . The whole style of the movie is original and interesting. I love how its a nod to the old video game style of the 80's and 90's.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Occasionally I experience a moment of &#34; oneness&#34; with the universe....a momentary connection with everything around me..... Then it is gone in a flash!  I suspect many people have these &#34; peak experiences&#34; but as they are so difficult to describe, treasure them in our hearts or share only with some special few.  Reading this book there were &#34;flashes&#34; of resonance with Dr. Alexander's description of his experiences.  Thank you, Doctor, for having the courage to share this with whomever is ready to hear.  (Aside:  the choice of Om as the reference to the Creator was a most recent choice I made as the word &#34;god&#34;, even with a capital, &#34;G&#34;, was too insignificant to describe what I sense in this realm.  Om is what I experience.)
B00CQZ65BU|4.0|I have enjoyed reading Jung Chang's previous two books, 'Wild Swans' and 'Mao: The Unknown Story'. These two books contributed much to a critical understanding of China in the 20th century, particularly communist China. On the other hand, I have had only a rudimentary knowledge of what happened in China during the final decades of the Qing dynasty, from, say, 1850 till 1910 or so, just prior to Sun-Yat-Sen's Republican movement. This new book by the author deals with these twilight  decades of the Qing dynasty in the context of the life and times of the Empress Dowager Cixi. Hitherto, I had entertained an image of the Dowager Cixi as a ruthless Manchu ruler in pursuit of power and as one who committed the murder of near and dear ones in order to remain in power. This book turns this whole conventional picture upside down and paints a radically different view of Cixi, based on the author's research from newly opened archives in China and the West. Needless to say, I found it an absorbing, fast-paced  and thought-provoking narrative, making me constantly reflect on parallels with today's China.<br /><br />Cixi's story is one of stunning success against great odds. She was ushered into the Forbidden City at age 16 as a concubine of the Qing emperor Xianfeng. Barely eight years later, she is forced to flee Beijing along with the emperor as Western forces advance on the city and demolish the Old Summer Palace. After Xianfeng's death, she returns to Beijing and executes a coup with fellow concubine Empress Zhen and gradually assumes absolute power over the kingdom . Her long reign results in pushing China out of the medieval into the modern age.  She opens China to foreign trade, lets the Chinese be educated more universally, in Western sciences rather than just Confucian edicts, abolishes the horrendous practice of foot-binding on Han women, builds railways, introduces the telephone and the telegraph, modernizes its army and navy and even allows limited freedom of the press. She accomplishes a lot of these changes by working through consensus, obtained by coaxing and cajoling and at times through coercion, but by and large without much violence. It was a remarkable achievement, considering that she was a woman and discrimination against women was almost total in the Manchu order of things in the 19th century.<br /><br />On the debit side, Cixi did poison her own adopted son to death, killed one of his favorite concubines with consummate cruelty and indulged the Boxers to commit massive violence against foreigners and Christians. Jung Chang is quite laudatory about Cixi and treats many of her 'crimes' quite lightly. In the author's view, it appears that Cixi was demonized a lot unfairly by subsequent Chinese and Western historians, mainly due to lack of information and possibly also due to her being a woman. However, this book is meticulously researched and shows the scholarship of the author. I would like to think that the book will stand up to the scrutiny of scholars on China.<br /><br />Reading the book, one cannot but be struck by the many parallels to what happened (and is happening) under communism in China to what happened during Cixi's long 47-year rule. The Manchu monarchy, the palace intrigues and the decades-long rule by Cixi have their echoes in the Communist Party dictatorship, the intrigues and purges in the Party and the 27-year long rule till death by Chairman Mao. Cixi's deranged unleashing of the Boxers on foreigners and Christians, resulting in scores of murder, death and destruction mirrors Mao's bloody Cultural Revolution against 'capitalist roaders', resulting in mass killings and chaos. The elites of the Qing ruling class were guilty of acute xenophobia towards the West and preferred to live in a fishbowl, ignoring the outside world. China, under Mao, also was paranoid about the capitalist West and preferred to eschew trade with the outside world and be inward-looking. On the other hand, Cixi was a modernizer, who wanted to trade with the West and learn from Western institutions. She believed that making 'China strong' through trade and Western know-how was the best way to protect the kingdom. This has echoes in Deng XiaoBing's opening of China to Globalization, sending Chinese students to study abroad and investing in a strong economy and military. Cixi, for all her outward-looking modernism, believed in keeping the Manchu empire intact, even if it meant suppression of the Han population as well as the minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet. She allowed a bit of press freedom and democratization towards the end but firmly believed in keeping the Manchu race in undiluted power. Today's China allows a little bit of openness through the internet and television but believes strongly in keeping the Communist Party in absolute power, even as it denies freedom to its population, Han as well as the minorities. The Manchu ruling elite was almost exclusively male and the Communist Party elite of today is also pre-dominantly male. It is tempting to use the cliche that the more things change, the more they remain the same. But it would be unfair to say so because of the massive changes which have occurred today in China on the upward mobility and staus of women, the embrace of Western Science and the widespread literacy and access to education for all social classes.<br /><br />However, in one respect, the old problems still remain. China today is going through internal debates inside the Party on the pressing need to change the economic system, the need for more democracy, the need for more independent institutions in society. The Party is struggling to find a way to do it without alienating the conservatives and by not diluting the control of the Party over society and economy. Cixi grappled with exactly the same problem while trying to modernise China by keeping full Manchu control. Even she found out that a little bit of democratization resulted in lesser and lesser control of the monarchy over society. It would be interesting to see if today's China has the genius to solve this question in any novel way, different from hitherto- applied methods elsewhere in the world.<br /><br />With her three books, the author has effectively covered modern Chinese history from the 1850s till Mao's death in 1976. I enjoyed reading this book very much. I feel that the 'Chinese miracle'  is not just the material progress made in the past 30 years but the amazing changes which occurred in China under Cixi in early 20th century, given the dysfunctional state of society during the second half of the 19th century under the Qing empire., who wanted to trade with the West and learn from Western institutions.

0316322407|5.0|This excellently written book is so very enlightening as to what life is like there for women and girls it borders chilling.  Malala wrote this herself so you get a first-person view of things in that culture.  You get hooked from the first paragraph of the introduction or opening, she weaves in what is happening in the world at that time - bin Laden, WTC 911, etc. - and how she sees it affecting her life, family and town.  You come away with a much better understanding of what is really going on in that culture, not just getting the same old stories we hear in this country.  It shows how truly frightening it would be to live under the Taliban and similar radical groups if they were to infiltrate our culture here.  Your view of Malala and what she did will be positively multiplied as you read this and you will find yourself cheering on and applauding her remarkable father and what he stood up for and cherished.  This is a great read, one you will want to share with friends and family members over the age of 12.  I, personally, would drive for hours and hours to attend an event where she would be the keynote speaker.
B0044DEAUA|2.0|I have a [[ASIN:B005YZZJDY Jabra Journey]] and had to fly out of state to help my daughter move back home. She was to drive the truck and I'd drive the car. I took my Jabra and ordered this one for my daughter, so we could communicate safely on our drive back home. I went with this one because of its glowing reviews and cheaper price. I am just so disappointed in it.<br /><br />The thing that irritates me more than anything is the charger port location. There is a slide to clip it to your visor, just like the Jabra Journey. That means that it will face downward, so when you look up at your visor, you'll see the front of the device. Fine. That's the way it should be.<br /><br />So what engineer in his right mind then would design it so that the charging cord attaches to the BACK of the device? Seriously?! I couldn't believe it and don't understand it all. We'll forget for a moment that the slide clip is only magnetized to the device, but having to remove the cord to attach it makes it only good for local use because you have to charge it and then completely remove the cord in order to use it. It's makes it entirely useless for traveling long distances.<br /><br />Sure you would think that you could just attach the cord anyway and clip it on, it may be lopsided but would still work, right? WRONG! Because the clip is only magnetized, as soon as you attach the cord down the device falls.<br /><br />Sound quality is okay. At first my daughter complained about it but that was because she had the window down. She's not familiar with the use of one of these. In any case, when we were in the car, the sound was good. The problem we had was people hearing us. For some reason, they had trouble. My son described it as watery sounding.<br /><br />Finally, it is not fair to complain that it still stays connected, even when in the house. All of them are designed that way. My Jabra does the same thing. This ensures a good connection and should not be a fault. The simple answer is to turn your bluetooth off on your phone. You should do that anyway to save battery life.<br /><br />I really have to recommend the Jabra, because I absolutely adore it. The cord attaches on its side, as it should. The incoming sound is very loud, so much so that I have to turn it down. Everyone can hear me just fine. The only problem with the Jabra is its own voice. I can't always understand what she's saying and when she announces the incoming caller's number, I can never hear her. I don't know why its voice is so low. Outside of that, it's my only complaint.<br /><br />All in all, this isn't such a good deal. I only give it the two stars because it IS usable, at least. It just has a serious design defect and output issues.turn your bluetooth off on your phone.

B00GM7SUY8|4.0|\\"Diana\\" (2013 release from the UK; 113 min. ) brings the last 2 years in the life of Diana, Princess of Wales. As the movie opens, we see Diana (played by Naomi Watts) getting ready in the Ritz Hotel in Paris, on that infamous day of August 31, 1997. Then the movie jumps back 2 years earlier. Diana and Charles are living separate lives. We see Diana in sweatpants and unhappy (and alone) at her London residence). By chance Diana meets Hasnat Khan, a Pakistani heart surgeon (played by Naveen Andrews). It isn't before long that Diana and Khan are falling for each other, and must go to extraordinary measures to keep this a secret from the press and from the world. Khan tells Diana about his passion for football (a/k/a soccer) and jazz, and at one point Diana even dons a black wig and the two go to a jazz club in London, where Diana has the time of her life. To tell you more of the 'plot' would be pointless.<br /><br />Several comments: this movie has been universally panned by the critics, and it obviously has not done well at the box office either (more on that later), so I must admit I had some doubts about seeing this, but given that Naomi Watts was playing Diana, I took a chance on this. As it turns out, I quite enjoyed this movie! I have no idea whether the events between Diana and Kahn as depicted in this movie are accurate or whether some of them even happened at all (did the two of them really snuck out of London in Diana's butler's car and took a trip to the cliffs of Dover?). But in the end, the details are not what matter, in the sense that this movie gives a great glimpse into the utter loneliness that surrounds Diana when she is not out in the public (the movie restages a number of iconic moments from those last 2 years, including the infamous \\"Queen of Hearts\\" interview with the BBC in November ;95, the trip to Angola to meet landmine victims, etc.). Besides the loneliness, Diana also comes across as insecure and sometimes childish (at one point when arguing with Khan, she yells out \\"I'm a princess and I get what I want!\\"), so this movie is not just a one-directional flattering image of Diana. And then there is the non-stop haunting by the press, in particular the paparazzi photographers. It is so relentless, one cannot even begin to imagine what it really must have been like to live in the limelight like that. The last 30 min. of the movie (about Diana and Dodi Fayed) are painful to watch, as by then her life has become a complete circus, in fact more like a Greek tragedy, the ending of which we all know. This movie was capably directed by German director Oliver Hirschbiegel (best known for that Hitler movie \\"The Downfall\\" some years ago). But the true star of the movie is of course Naomi Watts, who took a big professional gamble when she agreed to take on the role of such an iconic figure. She pulls it off brilliantly in my opinion, and this is another Oscar nomination-worthy performance.<br /><br />\\"Diana\\" opened on 2 screens for all of Greater Cincinnati this past weekend, and given the negative buzz around this movie, I figured this would not be playing long so I went to see it today. The screening I saw this at was unfortunately not well attended. It's a shame, as this movie for me turned out to be a pleasant surprise, even if the subject matter is not a happy one (you won't walk out of this thinking \\"that was a jolly good time!\\"). Bottom line: \\"Diana\\" is definitely worth checking out, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray.ng with Khan, she yells out \\"I'm a princess and I get what I want!\\"), so this movie is not just a one-directional flattering image of Diana.

B003G4W49C|4.0|I did read &#34;Ender's Game&#34; before I saw the movie which just came out.  As a movie it entertained me, but as a book it exhausted me. Of course the book is always (in my opinion) better than the movie, but it's so much more intense and its ending left me in a state of shock.  The book fleshes out the character of this brilliant child.  You realize from reading it that he is being pushed to a limit which would break an adult, and is also being manipulated by adults who have no regard for the consequences to Ender if their actions destroy him.  I just felt like screaming &#34;Leave this poor child alone!!&#34;  His genius could have been used in so many other ways, and used in a way that Ender himself would approve of.  But powerful adults rule the world, and the rest of us pay the consequences.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Best retro invader game I've ever come across. Great sounds and graphics but the simple control setup puts it in a league of it's own.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have played Candy Crush Saga on my pc for some time and was very pleased when it became available to play on my Kindle.  I travel a lot and it is great to continue leveling up when I am away and not just when I am home.  I probably would have paid for this game, but downloaded it when it was free for the day.  Win/Win!
B000WTNCQI|4.0|This review is specifically for the remastered 180 gram vinyl release.<br /><br />The vinyl was flat and quiet. No complaints about that. The liner notes were nice, and the gatefold is great. The mastering was better than the original release in the 80s, but sounds a bit futzed with... lots of bass EQ added, for instance, which does address the thin sound of the original, but goes a tad too far. This album is never going to sound great, and while the remaster is an improvement over the original, I really think it could sound even better.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I'm not sure whether 3 stars or 4 best describes my experience with this final part of the trilogy, yet I opted for 4 because it is about Four and Tris and Four is my favorite character.  I do not want to give anything away so I'll just say that there are some heartbreaking parts to this story--some of its readers will be unhappy about that, however those parts are important because vital life-lessons can be learned from them.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Laine Moriarty is a great writer. I'm not sure why she is not more well-known. What Alice Forgot is just as good.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Really good read. As is the usual with a Malcolm Gladwell book. Opens your mind up to what it means to  be an underdog
B0030DHPGQ|4.0|Well written and full of insights about change management.  The examples were easy to follow and related well to the concepts. The notes section in the back and the summaries were a bonus.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|Started slow. It was good book however, I felt that I wanted to know more about her relationship at the end. It ended to abruptly for me.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The most touching story.  One of the best books I have ever read. The author has an unusual and different approach on telling the story.  It will make you weep and even laugh at times.  Not the fairy tale ending that a readers always look for but true to life which is not always kind.  I highly recommend this book. You will never forget it and maybe even be kinder person for having read it.
B00A5IXI7O|4.0|I mistakenly wrote a review about The 39 Steps book, but the movie is also very good. Follows much of the premise from the book with a few changes. I would recommend both the movie and novel.<br /><br />This book was not as good as some of the other spy novels I've read just because it is so short. The novel has an interesting (though less than believable main character) plot and keeps the reader reading through the less than 100 page book.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|AWESOME BOOK.... SECOND IN THE SERIES, CANT WAIT TO READ THE REST.... CASSANDRA CLARE IS EXCEPTIONAL!!  Favorite YA series ever...
B00499NHLC|4.0|The stories are pretty good, but I mostly watch this to watch the interactions between Cumberbatch and Freeman (and their characters). Good stuff-- hardly needs a murder mystery to carry it, I could just watch them shopping at an Ikea.
B0083TXXZ4|1.0|This toy was given to my boys as a gift. They were each given their own blaster to use. This toy is flimsy and does not work well. The darts jam very easily and the cartridges fall of the gun repeatedly. We even went online to see if we had assembled them incorrectly but that was not the case. Once assembled or re-assembled the gun works well for about 5 minutes, if we're lucky, and then falls apart again. We had the same problem with both guns so I don't think it was just that one was a \\"lemon\\". I will think twice before purchasing another larger scale nerf gun. We have a few of the smaller ones that are not automated and they work well. We were very disappointed.
0143121421|5.0|This book is also one of my favorites. It is staged in the cold war and has very relevant themes that persist today. I would suggest the book - the novel is very hard to put down once you get into it.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|great game.I like it a lot. cool graphics. good controls. good upgrades real style fiighting......... fun to play. nice nice
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 has increased on grafics alot frim temple run 1, very exciting game, the and i are having loads of funny competing.
B009XI7RF6|5.0|Pandoodle is a very unique, challenging, and surprisingly calming game. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzles (It doesn't use letters or numbers, though).
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I saw this movie a few days ago because it is a required movie for my writing class. The hostage crisis was a very real event, and I believe that this movie depicts it well. I would highly recommend watching this movie.
B00144VBBS|5.0|all the best Toby.  Perfect collection.  So many hits you didn't realize how great toby really is.  Great gift for a male country fan.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Zac Brown demonstrates his wonderful story telling talent as well as his expertise on the guitar.  His song about &#34;Marvin&#34; (his guitar) is touching.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|great story.  Never wanted to put it down.  Landay made Jacob so believable as a teenager today.  any parent today can identify with parts of this story
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia continues with the saga of Gideon Cross and Eva Trammel with gifted skill. So many strongly-realized characters, relationships...at the heart of it all a young, strong woman who has been through her own personal hell and back. As the two main characters are survivors of sexual abuse, this is a pretty heavy story...not afraid to be dark. But the through line is Eva and Gideon's intense connection, their sexual relationship scorches...and the growing love reveals itself slowly. Great moments of mystery/suspense as well...the story really has it all! Masterfully done, really enjoyable.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Loved it!  while it was working.  it just stopped working one day so I did not bother to fix it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Everything sucks!!!!! Except this game! It's a great time killer. But wondering where the daily bonus went? Was there but is not anymore..........
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very interesting angle on the future, that almost feels implausible at times due to the youth of the main characters, but ultimately makes sense in the context of the full story arc.  I won't reveal how it all ends, but it is safe to say that it is a surprising yet perfectly logical  resolution of unanswered questions and loose ends.  A great read.  I can't imagine how it will be translated effectively to a movie, so looking forward to seeing that attempt.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This is a great read that will I challenge assumptions and current way of thinking. Do yourself a favor and Choose Yourself.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|More or an RTS then i was expecting for a child. too much time management for 4 yld. looks interesting but not a distraction for a small child.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Great movie with wonderful action scenes. Movie was panned in some circles but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Good story that kept me interest the entire movie.
B00FOT936Y|4.0|I read this book immediately following the book The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon so maybe that's the reason for my slightly different point of view. In fact, it's the Amazon book that led me to this book.<br /><br />The first half of the book is quite interesting and a good read. However in the second half, Tony's focus seems to have completely shifted towards Zappos' culture - how the company values customers, employees and why is it important to build a brand and culture inside the company. In some parts of the book, it actually feels like you are reading a company mission statement and a culture book. Great!<br /><br />But then, in 2009 Tony decides to merge (sell) the company to Amazon for an all-stock transaction due to misalignment with the board members and figures that this is the best way forward for Zappos. He also highlights that Zappos and Amazon are a good culture fit in terms of long-term strategic thinking, customer centricity etc. But wait, what about rest of the attributes in your culture book?<br /><br />Amazon is known for beating its suppliers to death when it comes to pricing and margins (I am not exaggerating, there is an episode called The Cheetah and the Gazelle in Amazon's history where Bezos asks his buyers to target the weakest suppliers first, force them to drop margins, threaten, punish and teach them a lesson if they refuse to buy-in. The buyers then work their way upward from small to the big suppliers and use all the marketing levers at Amazon's disposal to punish them by decreasing their sales and isolating them).<br /><br />In contrast, Tony has described and treats Zappos' suppliers as one of their own (family) team member and explains how they work together to always achieve a win-win-win situation in all negotiations. (the third win is the customer). Zappos even shares their entire sales and pricing database with their suppliers to integrate vertically and sustain with them as one family. He doesn't want toput anyone out of business.<br /><br />What strikes me about this acquisition was that this is totally against Amazon's philosophy of the eCommerce world and everyday low prices. They will disrupt and annihilate any company or industry that stands in the way of lower pricing and profit margins.<br /><br />Even though Amazon (Bezos) merged( acquired) Zappos, they(he) promised to keep it independent. Sooner than later, Bezos is going to come around Zappos and how it treats its suppliers in his relentless pursuit of everyday low prices. As long as Bezos is at the helm, Amazon will still be about him even if it becomes 200 billion $ organization. It will be interesting to see how long it takes for this viral Amazon culture to spread (forced) to Zappos. if it does, how will Tony perceive it? Can he sustain the Bezos force to maintain Zappos' core values? Or would he quit and move to the next Poker table?<br /><br />This book can make a great sequel in about 5 years time!
B00CLZ48FA|1.0|I'm extremely upset.  I logged into my account, and a on the screen it stated if I followed the steps, I would get this movie for free.  However, that was not the case.  My card was charged for this movie.  I'm not a happy camper.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|I admit it: I was a zombie virgin. \\"World War Z\\" by Max Brooks is the first book in this ghoulish genre that I have read. I found a copy at a library book sale on the cheap and thought, \\"Why not?\\" And for the first 200 pages, I felt like I was getting what I paid for--an okay book. Not bad, not good, just okay. But right around page 200 Brook's post-apocalyptic tale started to get very interesting and very good.<br /><br />Most people are probably aware of the basic plot by now (the book came out in 2006). A plague kills much of the world's population and reanimates them as zombies. A war ensues, pitting the uninfected against the undead. For a long time, it looks as if the zombies are going to win, but eventually humans begin to strike back and reclaim their planet. Brooks takes on the role of narrator in the book, interviewing scores of World War Z survivors about their stories. These vignettes are arranged chronologically to give us the \\"only [written] record of the plague years.\\"<br /><br />I found the book interesting in several areas. First, the vignette style of writing reminded me of several other horror stories, namely the novel \\"Dracula\\" and short story \\"Ms. Found in a Bottle,\\" both of which are composed of letters or punctuated notes. I appreciated the stylistic nod to these classic works (whether intentional or not, I don't know). I also thought that Brooks' description of zombies was very robust and realistic. I was able to paint very vivid pictures of the undead in my mind, which I did several nights in bed after reading. It kind of creeped me out! Additionally, the more the book progressed, the more action (and zombies) there was. This made the second half of the book much more exciting than the first, as I mentioned above. Finally, of course the book is really not about zombies, but about how humans would react to such a threat--the good, the bad, and the ugly.<br /><br />As far as detractions go, I have a few. First, there is a fair amount of profanity strewn about the book. To be fair, some of the characters Brooks created would certainly speak, er, \\"colorfully\\" in real life, and I don't have a problem with those cases. However, I felt it was rather out-of-character for some of his interviewees to use such language. Again, I don't necessarily have a problem with profanity if and when it fits, but I felt Brooks overdid it in this book, which did make it more difficult for me to read. Second, I felt that Brooks by and large left out a huge chunk of what it means to be human: religion. There is a brief encounter with a Russian priest toward the end of the book, but virtually nowhere else does any mention of religion occur. I would have to assume that in the case of a real zombie apocalypse, we would see a lot of activity in this realm: people flocking to churches, other people writing off their religion, still others on street corners warning about the second coming, and the list goes on. The fact that only one or two of Brook's pantheon of players went anywhere near religion or God just seems  to be unrealistic, considering that there are billions of people in the world for whom religion is a major influence.<br /><br />Overall, this was a good and interesting book, and definitely worth reading if you ever wanted to know how a zombie apocalypse might work itself out. 4 out of 5 stars for Mr. Brooks!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Rather than base his research on &#34;belief&#34;, the author, for the most part, sticks to factual information to inform people who read his book about the historic Jesus....not the Religious Christ Propaganda most contemporary Christians have been fed since infancy.  This is excellent reading for every lover of history with a curious desire to understand and clarify the hyperbole about Jesus the Man.  Finally, a breath of fresh air about a subject kept far too long in the &#34;closet&#34; by religious fanatics and Christian Fundamentalists.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is very suspenseful and unpredictable. Just when you think you know the characters something shifts and leaves you stunned.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|Love this show. Well written. Well acted. Set in space. What more could you ask for. I'm a fan for sure.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game!! Get a little aggravating sometimes but still an excellent game to play!! Must try. You will get hooked!!
B000UPBSW4|5.0|I loved this series. Goodkind is a great writer that keeps you engaged. He's consistent and has great character development. The tv series on the other hand really disappointed me.
1476727651|1.0|Apparently I'm in the minority when it comes to being very disappointed with this book. I've read a great deal of King's work, and consider the Dark Tower series to be his best. I re-read The Shining immediately before Doctor Sleep was released, and was eager to resume the story of Danny Torrance. I wasn't sure what to expect, but what I got was an overblown AA story (Danny's a drunk just like his daddy was -- surprise, surprise) filled with useless (and distracting) pop culture references (Amy Winehouse? Really?) in what I can only assume is an attempt by King to stay current, one-dimensional characters, a predictable plot, and cartoonish, extremely non-scary vampires for villains who may well have been the Night Flier's bastard offspring, only they putter along in RV's instead of a Cessna.<br /><br />The dialogue was terrible, particularly between Dan and Abra. One moment she's an innocent adolescent and the next she's swearing like she's on shore leave. I hated the True Knot -- they were about as ridiculous as their goofy pirate names. Usually King is excellent at creating an atmosphere within his novels, a sense of foreboding, and a real fear of the villains he's created. Doctor Sleep has none of that. It drags on for more than 500 agonizing pages and the big showdown between Abra and Rose was trite and predictable. I didn't care about any of the characters because, with the exception of Dan, Rose, and Abra, I could hardly tell them apart.<br /><br />There's nothing here. Imagine your own ending for Danny Torrance, because he deserves a better story than this. Save your time and money for something else. King will continue to churn out 500-page tomes and people will continue to buy them because he wrote them. But for the first time in my thirty-odd years, I will not be among them. This once-constant reader is done.
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|Great movie, I just saw for sale at Walmart in apple valley,mn. I guess no need to pre order. Sorry amazon, but this time I used the other guys. I still would recommend this movie to kids of all ages.
B00ENBTI8C|5.0|So sad to see this was the last season! Not for the faint of heart, plenty of violence, sex and action.
B00BV1OT0O|5.0|this was really cute. I gave it out as a prize and the kids loved it. The texture and the paint itself seemed kind of thick and caked on though. But definitely a hit with the kids.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|As others have mentioned, these are the broadcast versions and are missing a lot of the funniest parts of the series.  The reason given by WB is that those were special for DVD and can't be done again for Blu-Ray.  That's total bull squirt.  If they could be done for DVD, they could be done for Blu-Ray.  WB chose not to do them, most likely with eyes toward a double-dip on people's wallets down the road.  I know the DVD versions by heart, and even when I watch the occasional syndicated version on television I know exactly when something has been cut, and it pretty much always makes the episode worse.  I refuse to let them keep my money for this set, and will not make a purchase until they do it correctly with the extended episodes.  They can save this sub-standard tripe for the trash heap.
B00633W614|2.0|This was a confusing book. never quite got the point of it all. I have read other archer books and have been very pleased but this one missed the mark for me.

B00FXEL00W|5.0|Beautifully written story about two best friends that find true love with each other. Both characters are very lovable, you can't help but hope they have that \\"happily ever after\\" ending. Looking forward to this author's next book.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|A Perfect Bond film. To the point, easy to follow and not to easy to figure out so the end is not ruined in advance.<br />Plenty of action.<br />I will say this film does not have the gadgets of the past but no matter never noticed with all the action.<br />I hope he stays Bond. Best ever Bond to date.
030758836X|5.0|Page turner and wish there were more like this on a regular basis.  Hard to find a book that pulls you in and keeps you hurrying back for more.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|This is a great app!  I just scanned all of my &#34;must-save&#34; magazine articles using this app.  It is such a breeze!  No more rats nests of magazine clippings for me!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Great version of an old classic! Love playing by self, although sometimes it is a very difficult win! Makes it more interesting!
B007C9N4H8|1.0|I was very excited to hear a new muppet movie was coming but greatly disappointed when I actually saw it.  Jason segal should never be allowed to be in any other movie and especially not  a muppet movie. This movie was an embarrassment to the memory of Jim Henson and was so bad that Frank Oz (fozzie, miss piggie) refused to be involved. Stick with every other muppet movie and avoid this one like the plague.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|OK movie but kind of slow in the middle.  Depicts the life of an alcoholic very accurately.  Hero with issues.
B00F1W1SS0|2.0|Where is the bass?.....I hear the kick drum all right but no bass!<br /><br />The musicianship is amazing but it's only execution.<br /><br />Nothing interesting in the documentary....they just speak about themselves....I find it annoying.<br /><br />I guess the soul of this band was Mike Portnoy.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|A lot of fun to play! Different ways to play! Pictures are clear and objects hidden, but not impossible to find!

B0026IQYEU|5.0|This is a great movie. That show the struggles of the time and tell the story of a man that made his way through to the other side.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|works just like it says! An excellent addition to my Kindle! Makes listening more enjoyable and also can be changed for each genre of music!
B008Q0B0I2|5.0|Never heard of this film before, but I really enjoyed it. The leads: Claire Danes and an actor I was unfamiliar with Charlie Cox were natural and believable in their roles.<br /><br />The movie has really high production values and features some beautiful settings. The cast will surprise you with many famous actors that make the most of their supporting roles (Robert Deniro, Ricky Gervais, Rupert Everett, Peter O'Toole, Sienna Miller, Michelle Pfeiffer, plus narration by Ian McKellan).<br /><br />This adventure story is well written and keeps you entertained throughout. Just a word of caution, remember this is rated PG 13, for rather slap stick violence but does include (not graphic) animal sacrifice  - I wouldn't recommend it for children under 11.
B00DHRLK84|4.0|The 3d isnt that great. Its one of those watch it once movies. Fast shipping from amazon as always. Avatar is a better 3d movie
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I highly recommend this book, not only I as it well written but the story is an important one that must b  told. Tell everyone  you know to read it.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Challenging, but very playable! Difficulty increases as you proceed! At times almost too hard, instructions could be a little more detailed!
B009HEMJCW|4.0|Another great recommendation for Amazon Prime members.  Never heard of this film, rated PG and filmed in Britain with some American and Canadian actors included in the cast. Unexpected, you won't really know where this film is going and it is a movie that you have to pay attention to.  The end is satisfying and not treacly. Peter Dinklage is convincing as a Paparazzi out for blood, in a role he makes his own.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I was really excited to read this book as I've previously enjoyed Hosseini's novels. I was somewhat disappointed in this one. At times I was thoroughly into the story and then the thread I was following disappeared . The story was touching, but I didn't like the way it jumped around and the connections did not come  until the end. I saw where a reviewer called this semi-on-linear. I don't mind reading books with different characters as long a.s each character's story  can be followed .<br />Unfortunately I didn't feel this book did that. It fell short.
B000OIZSVY|5.0|For anyone that enjoys reading about punctuation, and after all, who doesn't, `Eats, Shoots & Leaves' by Lynne Truss is by far the best treatment of the subject. Even for those readers whose most profound writing experiences consist of occasional emails, this book is for you. It is educational, interesting, and the continuous injections of humor make it a must read for everyone. To give you a taste, the title is based on the old panda joke, as quoted here from the back of the jacket.<br />\\"A panda walks into a café. He orders a sandwich, eats it, then draws a gun and fires two shots in the air.<br />\\"Why?\\" asks the confused waiter, as the panda makes toward the exit. The panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and tosses it over his shoulder.<br />\\"I'm a panda,\\" he says, at the door. \\"Look it up.\\"<br />He waiter turns to the relevant entry and, sure enough, finds an explanation.<br />\\"Panda. Large black-and-white bear-like mammal, native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves.\\"<br />Ms. Truss is an obvious stickler for proper punctuation but with an excellent sense of humor. Some of the many examples of incorrect punctuation and the resultant altered meanings are classic, especially the use of `its' and `it's'. If only my high school English teachers could have passed on this information in a like manner, I would probably be a much better writer today. On our limited scale of 1 to 5, `Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" rates a  six and a half.
B008469DGY|5.0|Fun little golf game! Control pretty easy, response was good! Had to be careful to slide finger straight! Easy fun!
B0037VNX44|3.0|This is a violent art film that tells the story of a man who can really fight and flourishes in prison, until he gets stuck in solitary and then a mental hospital.  Tom Hardy is not only physically gorgeous, but can also act.  It's just that this character is not very smart, has a short fuse and seems to express himself principally through his fists. He is released from prison and finds a bit of notoriety and a place in the world as a bare-fist fighter.  If you like to watch someone repeatedly punch people (and a Rottweiler) senseless this is your film.
0375869026|5.0|As a 40 year old adult I grudgingly read this recommendation from my daughter. Like the Harry Potter books this is a book that works for all ages. The overall message of the book is kindness & tolerance. The story centres around a year in the life of a facially deformed boy & the difficulties he encounters during middle school.<br />This is a heartwarming story which I highly recommend regardless of your age.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Still my favorite movie. It just doesn't get better than this. Great music, dance and comic performances. I don't know how many times I've seen this movie but I know I'll see it again many more times.
B007AL48UK|5.0|Great twist to an old classic! Enjoyed different tile pictures! Could have been a little more detail on some of the odd matches!
B000MGVCFO|1.0|I ordered a used copy of the hybrid SACD version from Warehouse Deals, Inc. It would not load/play on<br />any of my sacd and cd players. I ordered another copy from them and this second one had the exact same<br />problem.  I am quite disappointed by this and will not purchase any items from them ever again. They obviously<br />do not bother to check to see if these used discs work BEFORE shipping them. I have return both of them for refund.<br />BTW, this one star rating is a reflection on the seller, not on the Moodies album. I rate this album five stars. Just wish I could<br />have gotten a working SACD version.

B000FBJAOG|5.0|This book was actually a good read. I was expecting your average zombie book, but was pleasantly suprised. If your a doomer (or watever you call yourself) read this book, then check zombie apocalypse as ready. (another great survival book: Ultimate Survival Guide: Zombie Apocalypse by Karim Theos and Laurence Sutton [doesn't beat this book by my standards, but a close second]).

B00CATSONE|4.0|Very interesting and enlightening. Learned about the difference in being knowledgable and being imaginative. Genius is knowledge applied with imagination as its catalyst.People like Tesla are often scoffed and riduculed but eventually get their due respect.The author was concise and clear and established the premise of what genius is about.
B00634GHJA|5.0|I recently changed tablets -- this app made it a snap to move stuff over.  A winner -- one of those few apps that you ought to have 'cause you never know when you may need it
B001L83PLQ|5.0|Adichie is an excellent writer.  She is able to transport you to the setting; in this case the short lived Biafra.  I was a senior in high school when Biafra came onto the world's radar screen.  I had forgotten about it until I read this novel.  As a self absorbed teenager back then all I really knew was the people were starving somewhere in Africa.  I loved getting to know more about this (ultimately futile) struggle to create Biafra.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Interesting characters but the portion on the war was too long and I quickly lost interest in the second half of the book.

B00DYEN5QU|4.0|So, a Superman reboot. One thing I liked about Superman Returns was that it was an intelligent and elegant film with beautiful visuals of Superman and the city itself. Like a lot of people, one thing I didn't like is that there just wasn't enough \\"pulse pounding\\" sequences. Well, you definitely get all the mayhem and destruction you could want in Man of Steel. And yet, now I want some of the elegance that Bryan Singer was able to bring to the Superman concept. Maybe I'm just fickle, but can't there be both? The following comments I make not as a criticism but as a personal reflection. Now, I knew long before I saw the film that Zack Snyder hadn't used the John Williams music, but in my heart, the filmic Superman just doesn't exist without the genius of John Williams's score. I can't believe how well it holds up over the years--it sounds like it could have been written today, and Superman Returns was all the better for using it. The score for Man of Steel felt like your typical action movie crescendos and thumping. (I can only remember one, understated theme from the movie.) In a way, the soaring Williams themes felt like they gave Superman the ability to come alive and fly, since the association between the character concept and the music was so innately, strongly irresistible. That's Williams's gift. He has a profound ability to understand the source material and bring it alive with music. Would Jaws have been as effective if it didn't have that unbelievable, two-note theme that you could come out of the theater humming to yourself? And in E.T. you can instantly see the scene of the bikes flying through the air when that music plays. Are there any music sequences in Man of Steel that make you instantly remember the scene? The word for Williams's many iconic themes and melodies is, \\"indelible.\\" I admire Hans Zimmer and the many other talented film composers out there,  but I don't think, in my lifetime anyway, there will be any film composer who captures the essenceof film magic and the characters that inhabit that world in the way that John Williams has over his career. I say that understanding that there are plenty of people who turn their noses up at a melodic, gossebump score, the same way they turn their noses up at Tchaikovsky, and go to bed at night dreaming of having Alban Berg or Arnold Shoenberg as film composers.<br /><br />That said, I liked the movie for what it is. But I would say only about half of the substance of the film felt like a Superman film. And I definitely understand the reasoning. The filmmakers wanted to break from the tradition of Superman movies, not be bound by the filmic tropes that have been so firmly attached to it, and to see what comes out. (One thing they did keep, which I like, was the Superman-as-Christ figure, with his crucifixion poses; the scene of him in the church seeking guidance as he sits directly in front of a stained-glass window depicting Jesus in Gethsemane praying to God for strength and guidance; and the \\"He will be like a God to them\\" line...) Let me say this, I've figured that Zack Snyder's style is something most people either love or hate. Me, I'm a lover. I like watching his imagination and visual sense on the screen. (I think Watchmen and 300 are both great films). So, for what it is, this is a very solid action movie. For me personally, can I say that this a fulfilling Superman movie? No, I don't think I can. I think the creators went a few steps too far in re-inventing the representation of Superman on film. There was nothing as elegant as Singer's version, or as operatic as Richard Donner's vision, and no moment as singularly powerful as Superman's harrowing reaction to Lois Lane's death in the original film.<br /><br />As I was watching, I was wondering if there is a metaphor in here regarding those breathing masks that Zod and his gang have to wear. When they get removed, the character becomes disoriented and has to adjust to Earth's \\"atmospherics.\\" Are we, the audience, wearing masks of preconception that the movie rips away, forcing us to adapt to this new vision of Superman? Maybe so, but I don't think I'll be re-watching this movie that much because--and I admit it, I did go in with preconceptions-- I felt punched in the gut when it was over and I didn't get to hear the Fanfare, or the Superman march theme, or the romance theme. And yes, I know that sequels are forthcoming, but to see the mild-mannered reporter only at the very end, left me feeling a little empty too. A lot has been made about the seriousness with which Christopher Reeve took the role (even to the astonishment of the cast and crew). As an actor, somehow Reeve was able to separate the two consciousnesses, Clark Kent/Superman, resulting in a classic representation the metaphor I think is most important in the Superman mythos: that there is a wellspring of goodness in all of us (Singer carries this forth beautifully by making the James Marsden character not an antagonist, but someone who represents the potential for heroism in the common man. I think most screenwriters would have been tempted to make him an insufferable a-hole competing for Lois Lane's affections, kind of like Brad Wilson in Superman 3.). As an aside, this contrasts with Batman, who commonly represents the darkness that exists in all of us.<br /><br />Regarding the shocking carnage in the film, it was thrilling to watch, but I wonder if the pontificating by the characters in the movie Clerks about the genocide of innocents when the Death Star was destroyed by Luke Skywalker is applicable here. That is, the good guys won, but at the cost of killing an enormous number of non-combatants. In Man of Steel, yes we're glad Superman wins, but he was probably responsible for the deaths of untold thousands of people. One thing the Christopher Reeve Superman had to contend with in Superman II is that he had to protect the people WHILE fighting the 3 Kryptonians. His regard for the lives of the peopleis what prompts him to leave the city so that the fight can take place elsewhere and won't endanger the lives of the people of Metropolis. (It's kind of heartbreaking that the people think Superman is abandoning them rather than protecting them).<br /><br />C'mon though, who's going to believe that the reporter with the world's most distinctive jawline isn't the same as the Super Hero with the world's most distinctive jawline. Christopher Reeve thoroughly understood the dichotomy of Superman--that Clark Kent and Superman really are two separate consciousnesses-- and he could play that beautifully, uncannily even. Indeed, as I said, I think THAT--the dual nature of Christ and Man--is at the center of the Superman mythos, in the same way Superman and Clark Kent are at once both separate and the same, and the way humans have the potential to be both common and heroic. (And that Jesus Christ was both fully human and fully God).  Brandon Routh didn't understand it quite as well, and I'm skeptical that Henry Cavill is going to be able to pull it off. But hey, I could be wrong. I was one who liked the casting of Routh. He had a good \\"look\\" for Superman. I wish he could have continued in the role. Once again, the thing I think Man of Steel misses is that Superman is a kind of foil for Batman. While Batman explores the hidden darkness within us all, Superman, to me, has always represented the potential for courage, nobility, and goodness within us all. Although the movie is dark, and I'm glad that it is relatively free of wisecracks and stupid comic relief, the tone of the film seems to undercut the theme I just mentioned. Comments about the music can be added here too. The Williams theme was inspiring to the viewer (and it was the mandate upon Superman that he inspire the people of earth, not always fight their fights for them), and it was, well, quintessentially American sounding. (Superman has super powers because he is Kryptonian, but he gets his \\"aw, shucks\\" boy-scoutmoral values from his Middle-American upbringing). Hans Zimmer's score, while rich, reinforces the darkness of the film, and will never be one of those \\"iconic\\" scores.<br /><br />Objectively: Spectacular action and a story that benefits from a prepackaged archetypal narrative. Good visual sense, and I like the cutting back and forth between the present and the past, similar to what Christopher Nolan did in Batman Begins. I like that the sedition of Zod and his group is more fleshed out on Krypton. However, the movie is missing that \\"something special,\\" and I'm not referring just to the music. I love the very brief Christopher Reeve cameo in Cavill's face. The film does seem to borrow an awful lot in the visuals--the Pandora-esque vision of Krypton; the repeated Matrix allusions. Oh, and has Jimmy Olsen been replaced by a Jenny Olsen? I can't exactly tell.<br />Subjectively: What can I say? I'm a child of the 80's. I feel like a little bit of me was ossified after watching the movie. The ongoing saga has taken a dramatic turn, and the old Superman has been laid to rest, and I mourn.<br /><br />I do recommend the movie.<br /><br />By the way, the 3D is pretty nicely done on this release.
B0012GMY64|5.0|I gave this as a gift but I also own this cd. It is excellent. Especially like Andy's arrangement of Moon River. Brought back many a fond memory of my school dances in the 60&#34;s! Love it! Would recommend it to anyone!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really enjoyed the attention to detail for the period. The clothing, hairstyles, manners and cars were so wonderful.  I was hooked from the beginning and now I cant wait for season 4.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I usually or almost never write on a product bought.  This is my exception.  In the past, I have failed in trying to promote a good artist but now is my chance.<br /><br />Lady Gaga (Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta), which I will name my next child after, has come complete with her album “Art Pop.” She has grown quite much (as a 27 year old can) and in a very good direction.  The genius of her first two albums, Fame and Fame Monster, her music was found by some great, annoying, and inspirational.<br /><br />The second album, Born This Way, was I believe rushed by producers and I didn’t hear a single sound of life from Mother Monster in any tracks but “Marry the Night.”<br /><br />Now is the discussion of “Artpop,” Mother Monster has had time to write her poetry and place it to correct music. I would describe this album as the only Rock-n-Roll album that that been produced since groups/artists of the Aretha Franklin, Debra Harry, Joan Jett, and Berlin.  Mother does what she states on the title, mixes art (poetry) with pop (ADM).<br /><br />There is no better artist and humanist to bring it all together than Ms. Germanotta.  She has brought tolerance among all people but at the same time upsetting the conservative right of our society (definition of Rock-n-Roll).<br /><br />ArtPop will remind you of what rock-n-roll, dance music, jazz, soul music is supposed to be. This album is sexy, against the conservatives, stands for freedom of speech, a voice for the monsters (myself included) and produces the sounds that you can crank up. Turn up the volume on this album up and dance your ass off!!!<br /><br />Thanks Mother Monster,<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Your #1 Little Monster
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It works and all but very limited on the Apps that I can use with it. I only am allowed 2 Apps (You Tube & Play Music). I surely hope more Apps will be available real soon. Can't use it much at this time.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|I was a little skeptical to purchase the kindle version based on some of the reviews, but I haven't ran into any of the problems that were mentioned, the font is perfect, the formatting is just like any other book I have on my kindle and each book is divided so you can start from each one if you want.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book helped me understand what a sniper was.  I was so happy to finally know what it was. AWESOME!
B00EI2Y4MQ|3.0|The idea of changing the equation seemed great but not the way this does it. If you enter 5+6= you will get 11, but then if you go back and edit the equation to 5+8 it will copy the equation and give the answer. It does not leave the original equation so now you have on the screen.<br />5+8=<br />11<br />5+8=<br />13<br /><br />I could imagine a lot of confusion about why there are both 11 and 13.
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|Bought this for my son.  We saw Gregory Porter at the Detroit Jazz Festival this summer.  Doesn't have as many up tempo songs as his previous CD's but still a great listen.
B00DJZR46G|3.0|Elton John is one of my all time favrorites but his later cd's just aren't cutting it.  The songs on this cd are slow and I like some songs with a beat.  I wouldn't have bought this cd if I had listened to it first.  But Elton is still a classic in my eyes and ears!!!
B00GH4R95C|2.0|A very strange movie considering several obvious flaws.  The audio was not crisp or easy to understand.  This is definitely a big screen feature and does not translate well on small devices like my Ipad.  Devoid of humor and lacking the heart that was apparent in the first two Reeve versions.  Very dark interpretation of the original.  Worst than &#34;Superman returns which was weak but did offer excellent performances by Brandon Roth and several others.  Strange movie.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|One of the greatest albums ever produced, remastered and full of new goodies including a live concert. Catch the Mac at its best on this expanded version
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It's easy to follow and it has a lot of info you can use when you need to check the weather.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I love Eminem.  He is the only rapper I listen to and buy his music.  I have been waiting for a new cd from him, he shouldn't wait so long to put out his music.  This cd is definitely a good one, maybe not quite as good as some of his earlier ones but a good buy.  I'll be listening to again and again and again.
B00EIBO8SM|5.0|What a wonderful, sharp romantic comedy.  Finally easily available on Blu Ray, Notting HIll does not disappoint.<br />The BR disc itself has an excellent crisp video transfer - it doesn't seem to be a new HD master but it looks great. The features are the same as those on the earlier DVD.<br /><br />The movie is unfairly dismissed or pigeonholed as just another Julia Roberts rom-com, but this movie is so much more. A well written, bittersweet romance with solid performances all around. Although the movie ( like writer Richard Cutris' Love Actually ) does take place in fantasy land, Curtis realizes this and manages to tweak conventions enough to make it fresh and delightful. Roberts' character is not a fairy princess but instead is a pretty unlikable hothead, and the script deals with that. Grant's everyman is understandably overwhelmed to find a movie star falling for him ( and he for her ), and finds out that true love is messy and hard and intoxicating all at once. Just like this beauty of a movie.
1452126577|5.0|It had great pictures in it and it was very funny.  I got it for a gift but read through it before I wrapped it up.
B004184JZO|2.0|pictures make figure look much bigger. disappointed in how small figure is.  sculpt is great but it's too tiny. i was expecting something more like the mcfarlane 12 inch. not happy
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|Lame. Very dissapointing. There is little character development and the movie's plot seems very erratic at times. Not sure why they came out with this one.
B00F880BWG|3.0|This rating given 5 episodes in to season 4.  The new producer/director seems enamored with portraying lots of gore.  Overall less character development replaced with action sequences and blood.  Season isn't bad, but I was expecting more.  3 star review to me means you can watch and enjoy, but is somewhat forgettable.<br /><br />There are plenty of episodes left to turn it around, if it continues at this pace I'd downgrade to 2 star review, if it improves it'll go back to a 4 star.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Great book with LOTS of helpful information.  I recommend it to anyone having stomach issues or that has recently been diagnosed with Celiac.  Its a real eye opener!

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I just was lost in enjoyment.  The film features a very funny premise, superbly executed.  Good script, exacting production values.
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|Disney do not make another one. Lately Disney films have not been exaclty the best and this is one of them. First off I do not care who is big in hollywood pick people who are brilliant for the part not just because their name is big. Second the story was very boring the colors were great and so were the animated characters but the story did not have any really good points to it and about a hour and a half into the film I turned it off. As for a family film not so much children would get frightened by some of the characters and they made Oz too much of a ladies man and also they could have done without Mila Kunis taking off the top of her dress even though something was underneath when she was turning into the wicked witch. Honestly I was not impressed and expected a much better movie they should stop trying to base films off the original because you cannot outbeat &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34; it is a classic and I have an open mind but this did not cut it. There is also too much drama between the witches if you like boring movies with bright colors and drama then you will enjoy this film.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. Easy quick read yet I couldn't put it down. Just read it a second time before the movie comes out and just as good as the first time.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Castle ! One of the best series ever.  We can watch them over & over again & enjoy the humor all the cast members have.  Just love it.  I hope they continue this series for a long time.  We never get tired of watching them.
B00DJLLO0M|4.0|I am going to be the odd one out. I really liked it for what it is. It's a Geffen output with Steven playing the role of producer and mixer. SW has been putting out some innovative, challenging prog rock compositions for the most part. In this album, I have to admit, it's not a SW album,  is a welcome break from the progressive output.<br />The songs may be short and in some cases not fully explored, but boy it's extremely accessible and I can sit through the entire album without getting exhausted by the music.<br />All tracks have a pop, melodic trait to them elevated by Wilson's mix and inclusion of strings. Each track is short to the point, and almost gets you humming but stops short due to it's length.<br />Tracks are though pop/rock oriented are reasonably varied, one track in particular \\"The only fool is me\\" if played as a single, would have Mercury Rev fans jumping for joy.<br />The 5.1 mix is warmly done, sounds are more immerse instead of ping ponging around the speakers. Nothing less is expected from a SW 5.1 remixed record.<br />So all I can say is that while this may disappoint intense SW fans, audio listeners who appreciate short and melodic compositions should pick this up.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I must admit some of the levels are past the point of frustrating when it takes forever to get through it.  Those become boring for me after awhile.  Anyone I have told about this game gets hooked on it too once they play.  Lately I have been having issues with my built up lives disappearing for no real reason at all -- wish that wouldn't happy but overall a great game.
145551389X|5.0|If you're a lady gaga fan or lover like me this is one item you need to have. The picture are great and and show many sides to her. The also show pictures that no mag would have had.
B004P12SSW|3.0|Very nice dancing & singing, decent acting, but the story was just too predictable.  It did not feel original at all - many other movies have gone down this path and have done it better.  It also was a completely watered down representation of burlesque - not sexy, not funny.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|Really entertaining movie.  It may be a fairy tale, but it was really fun to watch.  Thank You Amazon for making it available.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like the fact the there are time restriction after the puzzles and with the regeneration of lives.  it keeps me honest with the real world!  gameplay is like a trippy more challenging bejeweled.  much fun to play!
B00F91SCXC|3.0|On one hand this is well produced, has good actors, and is an exciting evening. On the other hand, it's yet another apocalyptic zombie movie, this one combined with a CDC-epidemic thriller. Like a cross between Contagion and Night of the Living Dead. Nothing profound, no great cinematic triumphs.<br /><br />But hey, I like epidemic movies and I like zombie movies so this was a blast to watch. A guilty pleasure for the kid in me. If you are in doubt, go ahead and watch it. You will be entertained.
1476727651|5.0|Loved it. That's enough to say. This is getting on my nerves. Really this is ridiculous. Bite me. Thank you
B003TOPQI0|5.0|Wow!  What a flashback type movie.  I enjioyed it and I'm glad it is in my collection.  It is not a classic.
B00G32TD98|4.0|Great Movie.  The movie is has some great creepy moments and takes some unexpected turns.  Very enjoyable for the fans of the haunted house type horror movies.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|This  movie was good. Wasn't expecting to watch the struggles of an alcoholic. Was glad it didn't end up with one of those happy Hollywood endings.  It gives a good message of how alcoholism takes over ones being. His decision of finally  accepting the truth was his first steps in getting sober.
0812982622|5.0|The Truth about the Truth<br /> In the Pulitzer Prize winning novel The Orphan Master's Son, the author Adam Johnson uses Jun Do (John Doe) to represent all North Koreans. Their lives are seemingly lived on tectonic plates. Catastrophes are ever present. Circumstances change without warning.  They absolutely have no control. Life in North Korea can be so jarring that one feels the tremors in each chapter.<br />Because the book is fiction and contains so many unbelievably frightening tales, one wonders if the circumstances of Jun Do and the other characters lives are based on fact. In an interview included with the book, Johnson explains how he used the factual accounts of defectors and his own travels to the country. He tells of a U.S. soldier who was taken prisoner in North Korea and was released after 39 years. Many of Jun Do's exploits are based on what happened to this soldier. Still, I wondered what was truth, and what was fiction in this book?  I sifted through Internet stories, mostly from newspapers in the UK, to find whether what Adam Johnson depicts is true.<br />Deprivation<br />  According to the World Food Program, one in three children in North Korea remains chronically malnourished or becomes stunted. The height of the average North Korea man has decreased. Since the state owns all land and farm products, little can be grown to feed a family.  Orphans starve or are worked to death. There are many abandoned children in the country because the parents are sent to prison camps or sent to labor in other far away places. A defector living in Australia has reported cannibalism in his native country. This has not been confirmed, but other North Koreans believe that it happens.<br />Prison Camps<br /> A huge gulag of prison camps exists in North Korea that can be seen in satellite images.  North Korea denies they exist. Very few prisoners have escaped. However, prisoner Shin-Dong Hyuk managed to escape and has given interviews to \\"Sixty Minutes\\" and various newspapers.  People are sent to prison because of \\"wrong thought\\" or for attempting to leave North Korea.  Entire families are locked up because they have associated with someone who is guilty of independent thinking or actions. An estimated twenty thousand prisoners died last year because of starvation. Camp 22, a vast 770 square mile (the size of London) complex, was closed by Kim Jong Un in 2012.  No one knows what happened to the prisoners. The prisoners' nourishment comes from a gruel made of corn meal and cabbage and supplemented with insects.  Because prisoners also eat rats, rodents are nearly extinct in the camps.  Torture is used regularly as stress relief for the guards who consider prisoners less than bugs. The prisoners work in mines and the logging industry.  By age 45, the backs of many prisoners are permanently bent at a 90 degree angle.  Pregnancy is prohibited in the camps. The mothers must execute their own newborns, or pregnant women may be cut open and the baby and mother both executed.<br />Abductions<br /> There are currently eighteen cases of Japanese citizens who have been abducted by North Koreans. It is thought that many have been kidnapped to teach Japanese language and culture in North Korean schools. Approximately, 486 South Koreans have also been abducted.  Some were murdered so that North Koreans could make use of their identities. Small boats are used to take victims from beaches and ocean front towns. There is also available a labyrinth of tunnels under the DMZ to infiltrate South Korea.<br /><br />However, not through journalistic accounts did I truly understand the shocking reality of life in North Korea. I understand North Korea through Adam Johnson's astonishing narrative.  The biography of the fictional Jun Do helped me to grasp how deprivation and fear can enslave a nation.  Johnson said, \\"If literature is a fiction that tells a deeper truth, I feel my book is a very accurate portrayal of how the tenets of totalitarianism eat away at the things that make us human. . .  the reach of literary fiction is our best tool to discover the human dimension of such an elusive society.\\"
B004ULNJIU|5.0|Good movie since I am a Jason Statham fan and I'm obtaining all of his movies.  His later movies are the best.  Thak You Amazon for making them available.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this one, I loved the shining and enjoyed this one to wrap it up so to speak.
B009AJD5E0|1.0|This movie does not come close to \\"Alien\\". There was no storyline or a plot! The movie was so boring, I dozed off to sleep once or twice. I remember when I viewed Alien in the theater during its debut. It was the most scariest sci-fi I had ever seen. Prometheus is garbage!Do not waste you time or money!
B00ELU7A4E|1.0|I had no idea I was paying $9 for one song. I thought it was a whole album with lot's of Katy Perry songs. Not worth the money.
B006TLFIAQ|5.0|Entertaining movie and good to have on a cold day when nothing elese is available for your entertainment.  Thank You Amazon for making this movie available.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome and entertaining, better than most movies that you would rent so why not, I liked it a lot, for sure
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Every episode has something interesting and leaves you wanting more! Some episodes are more jaw dropping than others but all of them have a purpose to the story line. Absolutely love Daryl! If there is ever a zombie apocalypse I want him in my camp!!!!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|So happy I was able to complete this series. I waited months for the final book and it was worth it.<br />I had to wait a few months so I had to go back and refresh myself with some of the details but it all came back pretty quickly.  If you haven't read the Divergent series I'd suggest reading them one after another much like you would read 'Hunger Games'.<br /><br />Others have, and will, summarize the story line and they'll do a much better job of that than I ever could. From an average reader's point of view - all of the books in the series were very good and this final book won't disappoint you.
B005OK721G|5.0|Almost a classic.  A very sad tale of a very talented young woman who suffers lifes indignities. However, she survives and moves on.
1400052181|5.0|Wow! Amazing book and story. Couldn't put is down and to think it is a real story.<br />A great read
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's a maturing product like all of Google's products.  Very simple to setup.  Works great but there is a slight delay from your PC or what ever device to the picture on the TV.  All in all I like it and hope they continue to improve it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham is Grisham.  I've been disappointed in the past by authors who put their name on a book that turned out to be awful. Not so with Grisham.  This book is reminiscent of his previous legal thrillers.  Others have summarized the story line much better than I could ever hope to so I'd suggest you read their reviews if that's what you're looking for.<br /><br />But, for an average guy just looking for a good read - this one worked.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|Enjoyable movie that I had watched before and wanted it in my collection.  I enjoy watching it every once in a while.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Great cast but a convoluted plot makes this slow, boring and uninteresting. Slow, convoluted and boring is not a good formula for cinema.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Libii makes great apps.  I love this princess salon game  &amp; hope they add more choices to the app. I would love to see more outfits and hair styles, as well as makeup
1439153663|4.0|The book is well written and gives a sense of the time in Russia when the royal family was being held before their murders.  It has quite an unexpected twist at the end.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This book was an entertaining fun read.  I really enjoyed the concept and the characters.  It was  a little predictable at points though.
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|Slow, phoned-in performance. The only reason I give it two stars is that I was invested in the story from the original movie.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE!! Yes, it is very different from what I have come to expect from Superman movies, but ulitmately this was really well done. Also, the fact that I can watch this anywhere at anytime is really great!
B0012EJVTY|3.0|Some of the songs sound a little harsher than I remember. It might just be that my music has changed a little bit over the years. I don't know. It doesn't sound the same.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is a very straightforward and helpful book on building strength and size, which is working for me.  It also provides helpful diet information.....which I haven't implemented as well.  So, it has been Bigger, slightly Leaner, and Stronger for me.  I need to work the diet part of the plan.<br /><br />There are also good explanations of dietary supplements and how not to waste your money on harmful and overly expensive ones.<br /><br />I am using a Bowflex, which is not the same as the recommended free weights, but the system still works.
B002PYOLFY|3.0|Good effects. Good acting. A little twist to the old tv series. I have watched it a couple of time and plan on watching more in the future.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I defently recommend this for children my 10 year old is absolutely in love with this game it's a great ti waster
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is a great read! It kept me rooting for drew and Kate. I would like to see a second  book to where Kate an  drew end up.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book I can't wait to start the next one I love that everyone compares it to fifty shades of grey which is why I picked the series but it is different such a different depth of strong emotions I couldn't put it down
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 was not as good as 1 or 2.  But it has it's twists and turns.  We have become a huge fan of DA, it's very well done.  Good acting and great character development.
0767919408|5.0|Bryson could write about his lunch order and make it a compelling read. A master story teller he weaves a long series of micro histories into a narrative of 1927. Bravo Bill keep up the good work and I will keep buying. Look forward to the next one.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Always great! Ready for the last one. I'm sad it will be the last one. Such a good series. Yay!
0307352153|5.0|Yes finally! .. a book that explains why it is okay to turn down party invitations, why it is okay to want to leave a party early, why it is okay to like solitude and quiet.. phew!<br /><br />The book explains that introverts are not necessarily 'quiet and shy'. Introversion simply means that they have a preference to do things alone and become easily tired/impatient/drained/distracted by the company of other people, preferring to avoid a lot of external stimuli.
B00005JG6Q|3.0|It's a pretty good film, but I just can NOT stand the voice of the leader of the children. He nearly ruins the film. He sounds annoying and ridiculous. I wonder if the original(?) Japanese has the same problem. Hopefully not. My next step (and recommendation, but with my fingers crossed): search down and watch the heck out of the original Japanese. There is such a thing as subtitles, ya know! But does anyone out there know if that Japanese version - assuming there is one - is acquirable?<br /><br />I would have given the movie 4 stars, were it not for that meathead floating infant's voice!!!!
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|I saw this movie several times when it first hit the theaters and I still like it this many years later.  It is sexy, humorous, and very wsell acted.  Faye Dunnaway's performance as the insurance investigator is great
B007THA4FI|5.0|I am half way through this novel by J.K. Rowling. It is terrific. I have to force myself to stop reading it at night and get some sleep.<br />Carol
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!!!  The only problem I have is I can't stop playing!!! This is one of the best apps out there..
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|I picked this version because by doing searches on the Web I found the general consensus was that this edition is the best quality and most respectful to the original, and the absolute antipode of 'fly-by-night'. Read others posts and blogs to see where I am coming from. What I personally have to contribute is that by seeing this edition the consensus was confirmed. So do your research - which should culminate in watching this here edition. I hear tell, though, that the Images edition is also good, is second best. Have not watched that one to see which one in fact is better. Buy both if you have the money, then write a review, please! :)
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|super awsome i have a daily youtube thing and i turned it off to the kindle menu then my computer frashed so i went to get back on and i tapped the app i had to start from the tutorial i mean i was to the village i addmet i was kind of in tutorial but i had to select a character again why?!?!?!?!?!
0440423228|4.0|good.  I've never read novel but watched the show and loved that the author says the comic is more his vision than the show.  so maybe I can skip the novel
B00F9040HU|3.0|It's not a bad game just verrrrry slow, after every challenge it's almost like it has to reset, not for me.
B000GPIPSS|4.0|A classic - but do make sure to listen to the version with the later-composed music dubbed in. The original classic is sorely lacking, but that music fills the lack-hole snugly. Without the music, this American classic could not compete with the German version/Classic Nosferatu.
B001L83PLQ|4.0|This is the first of Chimamanda Adichie that i am reading and love it! I got curious about the author after I watched her TED talk and I wasnt disappointed. A complex story of a significant event in the past, weaved with very interesting characters! Thumbs up to her writing still.. A bit depressing, but that doesnt make you want to give up!
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|I guessed the \\"big secret\\" when it was mentioned in the will at the beginning of the book, so I suffered through pages and pages of boring and mostly irrelevant legal crap only to find that the big climax of the book and the case was that predictable event. YAWN
B00913DPW2|1.0|Frustration to the max, the only way to play this game is with accompanying walk through on a phone or somewhere else, never know where to go next with this and there are no clues unless you have the walk through. Waste of time and money.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|When you start feeling sorry for yourself just pick up this book.<br /><br />Starbucks and iPhones seem so petty when you read what these men faced.
B00650SSDU|5.0|Great movie for a flight or light amusement at home.  Not Lawrence of Arabia clearly, but good for what it is.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|it was a good thriller book that had me on edge it is really good and im going to continue the series
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Easy to understand and very enjoyable. Glad I decided to install this. I play when I cannot get out to my own horses. Keeps me entertained for hours.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I really liked this movie and am looking forward to the sequel.  Enjoyed it with the whole family.  The HD was crisp & clear.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|My sone thought this was a good game. Obvious to me that it is aimed at a younger profile, I would be considered an older worker.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love to play this game. Its better than the other running games and a lot more entertaining. Its easy.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Very good graphics - Rented this to see if it was worth buying. Got my copy. What so many other robot movies could have been.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Paul Krugman is persuasive.  When the economics is so crystal clear regarding many of the problems America faces, it shows the moral bankruptcy of Wash DC politicians.  The action Krugman advocates is a quick and easy solution that should remove political aspects from the equation.  No one in politics can match his bonafides on the economic issues America faces and any attempts to debate him would be pointless.  His writing is convincing.
B008Y212PI|4.0|An enjoyable game.  A fun way to spend some time. Easy at the beginning but then bcomes more challenging. Would like to have more levels.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. Besides being fun, I think it's a great way to work on problem-solving skills.
B004JMY312|5.0|A fun holloween trip to take. Watch it every year with friends. Good clean disney fun! Bett Midler is awesome
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome product needs more apps but great UI!! Chrome needs to Cast Alittle better. I have already recomended to everyone I know!
0307352153|3.0|There is much to learn about what makes introverts tick. In Quiet, Cain provides a thorough compilation of research from the fields of psychology and neuroscience and expands on those concepts. Adults who are introverts will discover the great value of their rich inner lives. Parents and teachers can learn ways to assist \\"quiet\\" children both at home and in the classroom. In the last section of the book, Cain shares personal accounts of introverts and their experiences.<br /><br />For me, the big take-away was one of the points made by Cain that introversion is about the way a person recovers from a life activity rather than the way a person acts during that activity. A person can be a powerful public speaker. While the extrovert will want to go out to eat with others to discuss the success or failure of the just completed activity, the introvert may choose to recover by taking a nap, reading a book or relaxing by the pool.<br /><br />After a while the personal narratives became repetitive and it was hard to remain engaged in the book. The reader will not miss out if he stops reading the personal narratives once he \\"gets the point\\" Cain seeks to make.<br /><br />I would have given this title 3.5 stars if that was an option.<br /><br />I hope you found this helpful. If I can answer any other questions, please feel free to ask in the comment section. I will reply as quickly as possible.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Lots of fun.  Easy to use. Plenty of tools and colors to choose from. The reason it got four stars is that when I start to draw sometimes the color starts from the bottom of the page and not where I have placed the stylus. Maybe someone can  help me figure out what is going on.
B00GHJ6BJW|1.0|I was so anxious to finally hear a new album by Lady Gaga.  I downloaded ARTPOP the minute I was able to, and I just finished listening to it.  I should have listened before I bought it, because there is maybe one song on it that I like.  BORN THIS WAY was so important to so many kids that had a hard time fitting in--the music of Gaga used to give a voice to kids who had none.  ARTPOP is the complete reversal of BORN THIS WAY.  The music is over-produced, so Gaga's voice isn't heard;  the lyrics are sour and dark;  and the club sound is the beat on just about every song.  I feel as if she was creating an album for a rave party--this certainly is not \\"art.\\"  It's crap.  And I hope all the kids that love her stay away from this album and just keep repeating BORN THIS WAY.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just started this game and it has me hooked. It's a mind boggling game that even my kids get into. I would even go as far to say it's addictive
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is as close to the pc version as it can get and my favorite thing, it allows you to SIGN IN and SIGN OUT!
B00CFNUMD0|4.0|Our kids and I both love this show. Very well done. No dialogue fun for all. Grandma and grandpa even enjoy this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Was very happy when candy crush saga came to kindle fire. Love playing it. I just wish you get more then five life's.
B007DIQC90|5.0|OMAM are a really amazing band, each and every single one of the songs in this album are amazing. They manage to be very melancholical but without being depressing.<br />I hope the next album will be even better.
B004QCJA7W|5.0|Great book.  Nice size and perfect  display book.  It is just as I had hoped it would be.  I love this story
B00FQPHOPI|1.0|I am very disappointed.  This movie came very close to feeling like a complete waste of over 2 hours of my life.  This movie lacks much of the spirit of Superman.  If you care more about the action than plot or characters, then you will enjoy the movie more than I did.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Some people just like to hate on someone because they are \\"mainstream\\" or \\"ultra popular\\" and don't like the idea of listening to something that so many others listen to as well. That used to be me when I was younger.<br />Other people listen to somthing EXPECTING it to sound like \\"this\\" or \\"that\\" and if it ends up not being their desired \\"this or that\\" their minds automatically reject it.<br />And then there are others who are more receptive and open to something different and are able to put aside some of their expectations, even if just a little at first, to experience what an artist like Lady Gaga has created for them and for herself.<br />LG has pushed some boundaries here while still keeping her core sound strongly intact. It's really a great album from start to finish with few weak moments. Some things I liked a little more with her previous album and some other things I like more here on Artpop. In the end they are both excellent releases and will go down in history as landmark releases for pop music. These are not generic pop songs like we always hear on the radio, and you can tell a lot of thought and work went into creating this. Very well done and I give my Applause:)
B007PVHMCG|3.0|So much smaller than I thought it would be. I was expecting a big box of legos but instead this thing isnt any bigger than a dollar bills length, height and width. I guess its fine. Havent opened it yet cause its for christmas
B002SAUCBC|3.0|I hate books that don't have true endings. While I understand it's a metaphor, and you get what you put into it.... I just didn't dig it.. I am a HUGE King fan, and this one didn't measure up.
B005544V6A|4.0|Excellent acting...it's week scripted. very informative and they do will to make the stories about everyday life.<br />Easy to follow
1451626096|5.0|The is an excellent book which is the third in the series about the War of the Roses.  Excellent reading.
B00BAXFAOW|1.0|Not up to his usual standard and seemed to have more of a political bias than I am used to in his books.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Tear jerker. A beautiful read full of amazing quotes. It is a quick read, and very much worth your time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very well written by John Green.  Truly inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a smart, funny and sad book all rolled into one.
0062107313|5.0|What a masterpiece!! Amy Tan has done it again. The Valley of Amazement is an epic drama that follows the lives of two Chinese, American women. It spans fifty years of the lives of Lucretia and Violet, Mother and daughter. It is a beautiful accounting of the complicated relationship of these two women and how circumstances separate them physically but force them to follow similar paths. Both are scarred emotionally and fear love. Violet's loss of her daughter Flora eventually leads her to reunite with Lucretia. A deeply moving story also depicting wonderful supporting female characters who show the strength of &#34;sisterhood&#34;. The book also is a fantastic depiction of courtesan life in Shanghai...a wonderful, wonderful read!i
0525951652|5.0|Ken Follett is one of the best historical writers...he can transport you into another time..you feel how people lived, you began to understand what drove the aristocracy to war.  Informative, entertaining and you don't want it to end.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Just another great Jack Reacher episode that you cannot put down until finished. Really like his way of getting justice.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My husband and son play this first thing in the morning and as soon as my husband gets home from work.  They really love this game.
B003L16FAE|1.0|A newer release in the superior AVC codec with a higher bitrate, no less!  But that's not all!  With the Ultimate Hunter Edition you get the EXACT same mediocre, non-restored master used for the previous release.  But now it has been DNR'd to hell.  That's right!  Dutch and all his crew look like walking wax dummies.<br /><br />Predator was shot mostly with available light and ultra fast 80's film stock with some optical zooming thrown in for certain shots that had to be re-framed in post (so the film's texture is magnified), so needless to say, there is A LOT of grain in the original negatives.  It's SUPPOSED to look this way... gritty, like a low budget war documentary.  This Blu-ray destroys not only the grain, but ALL the detail as well.<br /><br />If you cannot wait for a better 4k scanned version, look all over for the original low bitrate MPEG-2 release.  Yes, one of the very earliest Blu-ray's looks quite a bit better than this garbage.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!!!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The movie started out a little slow, but once it got going it turned out to be a very good movie.
B0091XICM0|5.0|For the time it was made it had a great story and great special effects.  Fay Wray made you believe she was really there with Kong.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I am an 'Alien' fan and just had to know what happened to start all of this excitement!  It is an amazing piece of work just as all that came before or should I say afterward?
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Groundbreaking movie-making!  Unbelievably compelling. The acting and singing together are amazing.  There has never been a movie like this one.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Visually and audibly stunning. If you like the series, this is definitely going to impress. Makes having a 3d setup worth it.<br /><br />Two downsides:<br />How is the shortest book of the series the only one that gets broken into three parts, each of which are (or will be) longer that all of the other movies??<br /><br />There are a couple of parts that aren't true to the book, seemingly unnecessarily. White orc.
B000028U0Y|5.0|A classic!  A must for any Johnny Cash collection.  Full of favorites and sounds more authentic than a studio album!
B005LAIIMG|5.0|It was as exciting and entertaining as I hoped it would be.  Situations you don't expect that keeps your mind working trying to figure it out before they do...............lol.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|yet another great game.  loved it from beginning to end really liked 2 extra bonus chapters.  as in most big fish games long game play.  just wish amazon had more bfg I go on my phone and there and there are tons of bfg I prefer playing on kindle than phone amazon you are losing money to apples itunes!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is a fantastic story that is well done in the movie. Be ready for an emotional ride, though.<br /><br />The cinematography is great. All roles were filled well and the performance was great.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Bought this for Hurt and Personal Jesus.  I was not expecting to be so moved by In My Life.  Be careful when listening while driving, I was weeping in traffic!
B0098460O4|5.0|This is the greatest album I have ever heard. Bar none. It is beyond superb.. It is the best thing I have ever heard done by any singers. It is practically celestial in it's effect on my Heart. thank you for this input form and for posting my input.
B00005K9LM|4.0|Coming hot on the heels of their certified metal classic, \\"Screaming For Vengeance,\\" it would be easy to slag odd \\"Defenders Of The Faith\\" as sub-par. That would be a fool's errand, because while \\"Defenders\\" doesn't have the song for song knockout blows of \\"Screaming,\\" it still delivers a mighty powerful blow. The twin guitars of Glenn Tipton and KK Downing rip from the opening \\"Freewheel Burning,\\" while adding sting to a couple of new Priest Classics, \\"Love Bites\\" and \\"Heads Are Gonna Roll.\\"<br /><br />This was the period in which Judas Priest were at their most aggressive, sometimes outlandishly so. The ode to rough sex, \\"Eat Me Alive,\\" got the band in hot water with Tipper Gore and her Parents Musical Research Center (remember the PMRC and their obsession with dirty music overall and Prince in particular?) for its particularly graphic narrative. \\"I'm going to force you at gunpoint to eat me alive\\" can still rankle those of a sensitive nature, but this came from a band who titled one of their UK albums \\"Killing Machine.\\" Between the snarling guitars, the double kick drums and Rob Halford's leather skybound howl, subtlety was not their watchword.<br /><br />\\"Defenders Of The Faith\\" also marked the end of a creative run for Priest. After this, they got the jitters from the emerging new wave of metal and - oddly enough - hair bands, too. It lead to the underrated synth heavy \\"Turbo,\\" an album that took the band several more albums afterwards to recover from. But when you look at the line-up of \\"Hell Bent For Leather,\\" \\"British Steel,\\" \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" and then \\"Defenders of The Faith,\\" it's a creative metal run matched only by the first four Black Sabbath albums.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a fantastic book that at face value will be nothing short of a great sci-fi book. Dig a little deeper and you will find that this is truly a book showcasing the human condition. This is a timeless story. Anyone from the age of 10 to 60 can read this and still find it to be a great piece of work. Just starting the second book of the series, &#34;Speaker for the Dead.&#34; I've heard it is just as good, if not better!
B001EZ2T7W|4.0|Good addition  to the Stargate saga. Somewhat predictable but most of the movies are these days. Some mild language that may not be appropriate for children.
B005MAHVBO|4.0|After having purchased the Whirld Tour DVD, I questioned the release of this combo. After all, it's basically the same set just shot in a different location. Why would anyone want that? Particularly as the other DVD is so excellent! I found this set for a really good price and thought what the heck, why not? I was surprised how different it was! The sound is different, the mix is different, Roine's guitar being higher in the mix, Neal's vocals are slightly different (I actually prefer this version of Lay Down Your Life), the atmosphere is different. So yeah, I think it's a great package! And the CD is from the Manchester show which sounds different too!<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, given a choice, Whirld Tour is the better of the two. It has a great 5.1 mix and the video is awesome, whereas this is only stereo and at times the bright spotlights wash out the stage. But if your a prog junkie, then you'll enjoy this as well!
B00FEHXISA|3.0|This episode loses the Ironman essence and overreaches the iron suit idea. I really Loved Ironman II, but this was a big disappointment.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie is hilarious. My wife rented it from Redbox and we immediately became hooked. I ordered it as soon as the movie was over. Prime had it in my hands the next day and we watched it again. Now, every time we have guests over who haven't seen it, we watch it again! Every time there are small things we didn't notice before that make it better!

B000XUBFE2|5.0|It is 2 o'clock in the morning and I have just competed The Book Thief having started just 2 days ago. Sometimes a book is a read - sometimes an experience. I will never see colors, sky or war quite the same again. It seemed to assign hues to humanity. How anyone could accused this author-artist of creating this book just to make a movie (I know one is coming out) baffles me. A movie is so visual and this book is, for me, so much more like a gathering of familiar words set spinning in such a unique form as to be for each reader a highly personal experience. My only critical observation is sometimes the language seems a little too contemporary for the 1940's perhaps as a concession to the younger readership it seeks to attract. I only hope they can really appreciate it! I know this 74 yr  old did!
B00FE0FO7U|5.0|I love this CD but there is a problem with the copy I have.  Several of the songs cut off in the middle of it and jump to the next. Is there something that can be done?

0374139563|1.0|I read \\"Dead Aid\\" in a bid to understand what was really going wrong in this sector. The title is catchy, and Ms Moyo seemed to have some interesting credentials. Yet I was really disappointed when I engaged with the book itself. The historic part and reflections on trade and debt are interesting. However, I thought the latter parts of the book were full of prejudices, unproven statements and correlations that don't stand the basic test of logic. For example Moyo systematically associates aid to corruption, without considering that there could be a problem of failed leadership that could even exist without aid. She suddenly declares that \\"foreign aid weaken civil society\\". On p.59 she is going even further and writes that \\"aids erodes the essential fabric of trust that s needed between people in any functioning society\\". I could not find any argument to substantiate this claim. And then it goes on, and on. \\"Foreign aid foments conflicts\\", she says. Really???<br /><br />Ms Moyo did a good marketing job, considering the quality of her writing. I am just amazed that she is now quoted as a reference even in academic circles.<br /><br />Before buying have a look at this:<br />- [...]<br />- [...]<br />- [...]

B008JFUS28|5.0|Thor: The Dark World is not only infinitely better than Iron Man 3 in terms of Marvel's post-Avengers phase two, but is also (in my opinion) THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE to date. Words cannot describe how thrilled and satisfied I was after seeing it... you must watch it for yourself. I was always partial to the Hulk and Iron Man, whose films were increasingly disappointing until The Avengers came out. The first Thor was good but not great, and Captain America: The First Avenger exceeded my expectations... however, Thor: The Dark World surpasses them all. 'Nuff said!

B00G91WB3S|1.0|What can I say that hasn't been said by many people already? The special effects, the action, and even the acting were all done amazingly to pretty good, as far as a range is concerned. As far as big movie thrills and explosions and incredible over the top scenes, this has it all. It was fun watching Superman do his thing by saving people, averting disasters, and being an all-around awesome individual.<br /><br />For those that know of the original introduction to Superman and/or at least agree with this excerpt, \\"Superman-defender of law and order, champion of equal rights, valiant, courageous fighter against the forces of hate and prejudice, who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for truth and justice,\\" might find \\"Man of Steel\\" to be very far removed from the ideal of Superman we have come to know.<br /><br />I won't go into specifics as they would spoil what happens but suffice it to say that there are many out of character moments in \\"Man of Steel\\" where Superman does things which are just not Superman whatsoever. That is what has put me off from this film quite a bit. Others will like it and that's fine. I understand that the writers and producers and the powers that be are looking to make more money off the Superman franchise and are hoping to cash in on a whole new generation of folks that see things differently. Can't blame them for trying to make a buck, it's their right after all.<br /><br />I'd simply say that this is indeed a \\"new\\" Superman, a different Superman. More of a man with super powers than a Super-man. If you were looking for Superman, then \\"Superman Returns\\" would be the latest rendition that at least was more in keeping with the ideal of Superman, otherwise head back for Superman I & II, and maybe even IV. Cough.

The knowledge and information in this book is changing my life and my daughters life, and i think it could change the entire world as we know it, for the better, if everyone read it.There simply is no argument against the power of love.. this book should be required reading for our kids.

B0000041TD|5.0|La Boheme is one of the greatest operas ever written. If ever there was a desert island disc, this must surly be it. Puccini is a brilliant orchestrator, excelling in big, dramatic melodies, with soloists soaring above the orchestra. La Boheme has remained a firm favourite since the Turin premier in 1896. The story in a nutshell: Poet Rodolfo and seamstress Mimi meet and fall in love. Mimi is sick with consumption (tuberculosis). Mimi dies, leaving Rodolfo grief stricken.<br /><br />This recording is one of the finest opera recordings ever and is pure magic from start to finish. The chemistry between the star studded cast members is sizzling. Pavarotti (Rodolfo) is in his prime. He has a magnificent voice with ringing high notes that are breath taking. Freni (Mimi) made this one of her signature roles and has rarely been surpassed. She sings with tenderness and vulnerability as required by the role.<br /><br />Admittedly, La Boheme takes a little while to truly warm up. At about 15 minutes in, the \\"big\\" operatic moments start and the hits never stop flowing. Some of my favourite moments/arias are:<br />-Che gelida manina<br />-Sì. Mi chiamano Mimì<br />-O soave fanciulla<br />-Quando m'en vo - La commedia è stupenda!<br />-Donde lieta uscì<br />-Dunque: è proprio finita! Addio, dolce svegliare<br />-O Mimi, tu piu non torni<br />-Vecchia zimarra, senti<br />-Sono andati<br />-Oh Dio! Mimì!

0847842134|4.0|Codex Seraphinianus [Hardcover]<br />Luigi Serafini (Author)<br /><br />The \\"strangest art book ever made\\" is back in print, and it's a steal at $84.00 (this used to go for 250-500). The Codex is an encyclopedia of an alien world conceived of by a mind somewhere between Jim Woodring and Albertus Seba. The whole thing is written in a language unique to this book, which can supposedly be decrypted using the booklet in the back (if you can figure out how to use it). The art and the book itself  is beautiful beyond description. Flipping through this book gives you the feeling that you are holding something you aren't meant to see, like something Doctor Who forgot in the coffee shop when he noticed the barista was a cyberman. It seems alien and ancient, virtually every detail of its production adding to the effect, right down to the large, rough pages it's printed on. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the back of the book has a sticker with a blurb, a price and a barcode. It looks like I could probably get it off if I tried hard enough, but it's not worth the risk of damaging the book. Get a copy ASAP, because it should sell out soon, and the price will shoot back up into the hundreds.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Started off LOVING this game......graphics are great, premise was great, fun to play!  THEN reality set in.  The Major problems:  As you progress, the game takes longer to load every field.  To the point you tap more than you mean to.  Which leads to the next problem;  you use your peanuts (money) without meaning to.  There should really be a 'ask' field when you make a purchase....We have inadvertantly bought animals we dont need, etc. because it wasnt registering the taps to feed the animals.  You will come to a point where the quests are only for animals you have to spend peanuts on to get, Can get frustrating, especially for kids.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Its such a intense game. Love the timing in order to find the items in each room.<br />I think it's great for the mind.

B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I was introduced to the Hyperbole and a Half comic/essay blog a couple years ago. My friend sent me the link to her post &#34;How Fish Almost Destroyed My Childhood&#34; while I was at work. This is not a story you should read at work, because then you will have to deal with your boss and coworkers staring at you in confusion and alarm. I laughed so hard I cried, sitting at my very public desk, making undoubtedly ridiculous noises as I tried (and failed) to be hysterical as quietly and unobtrusively as possible.<br /><br />Humor is a tricky thing to explain, but whatever it is, Brosh has it in spades. She transforms the moments of her life into hilarious illustrations that I wish I could plaster around my room. However, silliness isn't the only quality offered here. Brosh brings truth as well, the kind where you say &#34;oh, yes, that's it exactly! Finally someone figured out how to explain it!&#34; Sometimes that truth is also silly (&#34;Clean all the things? No...internet forever!&#34;), but sometimes it's deeper. As strange and non sequitur as this sounds, if I was trying to educate a person about depression, I would suggest to them two texts: one would be Andrew Solomon's Pulitzer prize-winning tome The Noonday Demon, and the other would be Brosh's illustrated essays about her own personal struggle. She perfectly captures what it feels like to be depressed, while still managing to imbue it with a wry humor. If that's not an incredible skill, then I don't know what is.<br /><br />In physical book terms, this is a well-constructed book. The art is obviously more condensed than it appears on the website, but it's not too small and she did a good job on the layout. There's a good mix of old material from the blog with some great new stories (Brosh breaks down the exact content on the site). It's definitely worth the money.
0738212415|5.0|Love love love this book. I am a 'creative' type but only in my imagination. This book is teaching me to draw things and make them look realistic like nothing I've ever tried before. Easy simple steps. Fun lessons.<br />My eight year old daughter is also doing the lessons and it's been so fun to watch her figure it out and be able to draw!!<br />I would not hesitate to recommend this book over many of the other books. I am also working on 'Drawing on the Right side of the Brain&#34; which is also good but loses me with the technical chatter as I find it a bit too dry.
B00ARN0ZF0|1.0|This movie was so slow and so boring that I fell asleep watching it.  When I woke up it was over, I didn't even attempt to finish the movie.  It was so bad.  This series needs to stop now, truly it should have stopped before this one was even thought of.

1492740381|5.0|Through these vain words of Lord Henry Wotton, “‘Beauty is a form of genius—is higher indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation… beauty is the wonders of wonders… When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you… Youth! Youth! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!’” (Wilde 26-27). Dorian Gray, the epitome of male beauty and youth, eventually falls to his demise. A man, whose words of wishing to stay forever young come true, ages through a mysterious piece of art with his every sin and wrongdoing. Starting with a few creases and wrinkles on the face of the painting, it gradually becomes horrific, and Dorian hides it from prying eyes. The figure of Dorian Gray in the portrait deteriorates with old age, and blood appears when Dorian involves himself in crime and murder. However, he continues living his life with the youth and beauty that ceases to leave him, only afraid of the discovery of the increasingly unpleasant painting. Eventually, Dorian realizes the reality of his life and all of the evil that he has done, but will it be too late for him to redeem himself?<br />The Picture of Dorian Gray is such an intriguing story. Oscar Wilde paints a gothic world with ingenious words that flowed from his brush. He teaches the readers what not to do with the supremacy of youth and beauty, showing that it will ultimately destroy a person in the end. Wilde also proves the negative consequences of influence on others through the relationship of Dorian Gray and Lord Henry. This relationship shows the corruption of innocence due to society and is the beginning of the madness that ends Dorian Gray.<br />I thought that this book would be boring; however, I was pleasantly surprised by Wilde’s quirky wit and dark humor. Within the first chapter of Dorian Gray, my attention was captured, and I was fascinated by the philosophical yet satirical content. I definitely recommend The Picture of Dorian Gray to anyone who is looking for a great classic novel to read.end The Picture of Dorian Gray to anyone who is looking for a great classic novel to read.

B004X6PRO6|4.0|Not a particularly easy book to read, but well worth reading.  If possible I think I would have given it 3.5 stars.  Johnson evidently combined the reports of several North Koreans to bring this story to life and provided the kind of information that doesn't readily come out of that country.

0143122061|3.0|Niall Ferguson's Civilization reads less like an academic study of social evolution than a treatise on conservative Western principles. Why has the West out-paced the rest of the world? It pretty much all boils down to one thing - Protestant Christianity. Ferguson's book is sure to be a hit with conservative readers whose existing beliefs it so readily reaffirms. But for those looking for a more objective and critical view of the evolution of human civilization, I recommend Fukuyama's, The Origins of Political Order.
B00DJ80VMM|5.0|Dream Theater is the best band out there.  Musically, they're tight.  I wondered how they were going to continue in the post-Portnoy era.  This album is a bit more like Images and Words than their last album was.  Different content, but the same feel.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Probably my least favorite of the three books, but still a good read. I felt like this book needed to be about 80 pages longer than it was! The beginning and middle were fantastic, the part where they are in the capitol city is a thrilling read! The ending feels incredibly rushed though, like she had to meet a deadline or something. Still, don't let the ending spoil the rest of the book for you, it's a perfectly adequate and &#34;happy&#34; ending with a good amount of closure (whether you agree with it or not). I look forward to them inevitably breaking this book into two movies, lol.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Another great Jack Reacher story.  I just can't put them down once I start one -- and they never disappoint!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I think this is the best book in the trilogy, I am anxious to see how the movie turns out! As with the first one it's a pretty easy read, an adult can usually get through it in a few days.
006202406X|3.0|I loved the first book in the series, and the second book was just okay, this third installment continued in the \\"just okay\\" realm.  I finished it because of my own curiosity about how the story of Tris and Tobias would play out, but I was certainly disappointed.  I found the dual narration to be a bit awkward, especially since it was a departure from the perspective of the first two books in the trilogy.  Disappointing, but understandable that people will feel the need to read it in order to complete the series.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I was always embarrassed that I had never read this classic, so when I found that it was available digitally for free I definitely jumped at the opportunity to read it. Even though I hadn't read it, I knew what the story was about. It's such an influential work that the premise has been copied time and time again. Not to mention there are countless phrases Wilde penned in this story that have found their way into our daily lexicon, so it's interesting to see them in their original connotations. It's a rather easy read and well worth your time!
B009MZQQWA|3.0|The movie is dated.  Used to be shocking and is now just camp.  Probably good if you are having a party and spending most of your time talking anyway.

B003VDX6N6|4.0|It probably won't win any awards but it is a nice little show about a smallish town in ME, that has a troubling secret.  Very entertaining and enjoyable.
B005Z6YHEY|5.0|Fascinating material, brilliant information and very inspiring. Highly recommended for anyone who might be interested in how the brain works and its capacity.
B000005ALN|5.0|Thrilled that I could replace one that had been damaged because it was left in a car glove compartment without a cover. Very sophisticated, soothing background music.
B000SOYEQY|5.0|The best movie ever made, as great now as when I first saw it in 1962. Some technical details have been improved, all of which are immaterial to the superb story-telling and some cuts have been restored which clarify some plot jumps. At the heart of this movie's success however is a compelling and true story of a man who became a leader when he found himself in the midst of chaos. What happens to this hero is the tragedy we are all at risk of being caught in when we act on our principles and our beliefs, without compromise and without assessing the venal nature of international politics. The story of Lawrence of Arabia is a metaphor for life, applicable to recorded history as well as the individual lives we all live in the 20th and 21st century.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so good you can't put it down. It is very very very awesome but I like minecraft a little more
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|I like Washington as an actor. I thought the storyline was fair to good. The streaming was excellent as was the price from Amazon Prime.
B00CRW2066|5.0|I love this band!  The have evolved over the years, but I think it's just getting better.  Still, I can play any one of their albums without ever wanting to press skip.  Trouble Will Find Me is similar to High Violet IMO, but they bring some of the older vibes with it and it's not as dark.... but still dark.  This album is in my top three, maybe first, I don't know, I love their albums for different reasons
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great Show! This DVD set is well worth buying the acting is fantastic. Sarah Paulson does a fantastic job. Buy it for a Christmas gift.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is fun for all ages. I would recommend it to everyone, who enjoy playing games on any electronic devices.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|I purchased this for my 5 month old son and it was the best money spent. After many days of research and review reading as a father that wants the safest and most durable products. This has lived up to it. The joy and happiness my son gets from the jumper is well worth it. As per the parents that reviewed it as having a pinch point with the elephant it can be lightly pulled up and turned away from the side and it is no longer a issue. I recommend this jumper fully.
B00GBCMW9S|4.0|pretty good album as usual for the artist.if you liked the first marshal mathers l.p., then you will like this one.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I didn't like how Captain Kirk was portrayed as a sex addict. That being said, the rest of the movie was a great flick.
1476727651|5.0|I have not been able to put this book down.  I am almost finished with it, but I don't want it to end.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Thank goodness Amazon created a Kindle for Android.  I can now read my books I've purchased wherever I go without carrying an eReader or tablet.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This book is edgy and darker than Gone Girl.  This book takes the reader to scary places in the human psyche.  It is cleverly written and a good mystery.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Runs nice and cool.<br /><br />Handles all my applications and games (PS, TF2, PoE). Overall a solid cpu. 10/10 would use again.<br /><br />Love it.

B00FAX6XQC|4.0|this app is pretty fun so far...I've only been playing for a little bit though.  awesome graphics and easy to play :)
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Great album - lots of different types of music! They have a wide range of offerings on this album and they are all good!!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Such a relief and a joy to read after working to get through FoC.  Now the wait for the next book begins.
034580404X|4.0|For the freak in all of us, cannot put the book down even more once you get to know the charcaters - you want to know what is going to happen next.......
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Let me start out by saying this:  I haven't seen a lot of Superman movies, but this one....this one was so awesome that I actually saw it TWICE in the theater, if that says anything about how stinking great it is.<br /><br />That being said...on with the review.<br /><br />Man of Steel totally blew me away the first time I saw it.  Partly because of the seemingly endless action, but mostly because of the constant sense of reality to the movie.  It made Superman feel real and totally relatable.  The second time brought the same exact reaction.  It was a total thrill ride both times!<br /><br />What shocked me the most (as well as any other hardcore Superman fan) was the &#34;controversial&#34; ending to the film.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!! IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET, PLEASE IGNORE THIS PART OF THE REVIEW!!!!!<br /><br />At the end of the final battle between Superman & Zod, there was a moment where Zod tried to kill people with his heat vision.  Superman then has a tough decision to make.  What does he do?  He breaks Zod's neck.  This marks the 1st time Superman has ever KILLED one of his enemies.  I was completely awe-struck at first,  but afterwards I realized it made sense based on the very realistic world being presented in the movie.  Its in human nature to kill when the situation calls for it.  Based on that belief, I think Superman did the right thing by killing Zod, no matter what any other fanboys would say.<br /><br />Overall, Man of Steel is the definitive Superman movie of all time.  Lots of action, shocking moments, and little pinches of humor here & there.  I highly recommend Man of Steel for any hardcore Superman fan
006207993X|2.0|Highly acclaimed, and perhaps innovative at its time. But I couldn't finish it - just seemed ludicrously unrealistic and belonging to a Flash Gordon era in a very different age.
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|What a stunning finale to a trilogy, if only it were a finale.  I still read the subsequent books but I've recently re-read the first three when the film came out and the first three are the best.  That's the trouble with trying to turn it into a franchise.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|AMAZING, BUT THINK ENDING SHOULD HAVE BEEN REWRITTEN! But other then that,it was a very good ending to the trilogy of divergent
0553582011|5.0|If I could get it away from my husband then I could read it.  We have enjoyed all the books and this one is no exception.
1905236042|5.0|My seven and five year old daughters love these cards and do them together without help. A great indoor activity,
031623480X|5.0|A compelling and understandable explanation of how grains and sugar affect the brain and what to do about it.  By a neurologist.
B00AGKHEUI|4.0|The package is great especially if you haven't purchased Rumors or the expanded edition yet. If you haven't I'd rate it 5 stars but if your like me I've already purchased the first Rumors, and the expanded edition for the second disc of bonus material. This has three CD set is exceptional... but it should've contained more concert material because Fleetwood Mac was known to be among the best concert bands around during the mid seventies and especially right after releasing Rumors. If the band, Mick Fleetwood or the label had released additiona concert material or better yet a full concert from 1976 or 1977 this edition would've been classic and clearly a 5 star experience.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I didn't realize how addicting this game was until my husband downloaded it too and then the race was on. Very fun and addicting.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great product, excellent delivery time.  Easily installed, video quality is first rate.  There needs to be an interface with the disc drive  on a computer, but I understand that will come in time.
B00E21YOLO|5.0|I watched this movie on my phone & Immediately knew I needed it for my collection. By far the best Star Trek. I can't wait to see what plot they come up with next.
B00FR0PVSY|5.0|It's Lemmy. It's Mot&ouml;rhead. It's rock 'n' roll. What more could anybody possibly want? Why are you even looking at reviews? Just buy the damn thing already!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|The book s The story line is getting good. Can't wait for book three... I feel it is going to get good....:)
B005MMY9A8|4.0|It was a pretty cool movie but it wasn't exactly the type of movie i'd normally watch.  I'd probably rate x-men the same and i love that movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am one of the many people addicted to Candy Crush Saga.  So glad that I can play it on my Kindle Fire.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Brutally honest and beautifully written.  I'd like to read some of the books the author mentions she took with her along the way.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This will be a gift for my son since he is a Columbo fan.  No doubt, he will like it.  Great price!
0670024856|5.0|The hardbound edition of this book is such a beautiful object that it just leaps into the hand. Not so much the cover, but the gorgeous color of the botanical lithographs used as end-papers, with similar engravings introducing the book's five sections, coupled with distinguished type and fine deckle-edged paper. It is a joy to hold and to read. Given the author's success with an inspirational memoir, EAT, PRAY, LOVE, I had worried that this might turn out to be a mere boutique novel. I need not have done. It is the serious story, in nineteenth-century fullness, of a nineteenth-century woman, Alma Whitttaker, born to wealth, condemned to solitude, and ending as one of the leading botanists of her day. It is simply superb.<br /><br />Serious, but not without humor. The novel is written in an elegant style that Thackeray or Trollope would have recognized, but Gilbert also shares their lightness of touch; the book is often funny and always readable. And nineteenth-century detail does not imply nineteenth-century sensibility; in particular, there is a frankness about sexual matters that belongs to our own time. After reading of Alma's remarkable childhood, tutored in mathematics and several languages, and above all exploring the natural wonders in her father's large estate outside Philadelphia, it is a surprise when in her teens her biological explorations turn to her own body. I even wondered if Gilbert were pandering to the prurience of modern readers -- but I should have trusted her; all these things will bear fruit much later in the story. Big-boned, plain-featured, and with a shock of unruly red hair, Alma is far from the normal debutante, and suitors pass her by -- but she is aware of her needs, and she does fall in love. In almost no sense is this a conventional love story, but it does have romance, and more than once brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />The novel starts with Alma's birth. But while waiting for her to grow old enough to be interesting, Gilbert offers a picaresque Bildungsroman at novella length featuring Henry Whittaker, Alma's father. Born in poverty as the son of an arborist in London's Kew Gardens, Henry gets ahead by stealing and marketing plant specimens. Later, after sailing around the world with Captain Cook, he establishes a plantation of stolen chinchona trees (the source of quinine), thus wresting the monopoly from the Spanish Jesuits, and soon expands to other aspects of medicinal botany, becoming exceedingly rich in the process. The story then turns to Alma. <br /><br />&#34;What Alma wanted to know most of all was how the world was regulated. What was the master clockwork behind everything? She picked flowers apart and explored their innermost architecture. She did the same with insects, and with any carcass she ever found.&#34; Gilbert's use of the word &#34;clockwork&#34; is not accidental, because as we move into the middle of the century, the question of origins becomes more and more a part of scientific thinking; is the world as we see it the creation of a Master Watchmaker or formed by natural processes? Alma, though a conventional churchgoer, is a strict atheist in her science. But her most profound experiences will come when she meets a remarkable younger man, a botanical illustrator of exquisite skill, who nonetheless believes in forces that defy logic. Eventually, through her study of mosses, she will develop her own theories very similar to those of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, but decline to publish them because of her concern with issues of human behavior -- altruism and self-sacrifice -- that seem to contradict the idea of the survival of the fittest. This internal conflict, between science and spirituality (or at least humanity), is the subject of the entire book in a nutshell. It may lose a little momentum two-thirds of the way through (oddly enough, when Alma leaves her Philadelphia estate and begins to travel around the world). But it never loses its integrity orits particular access to grace, summed up beautifully by Alma's reaction to reading THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES:<br /><br />&#34;It was a beautiful book. She wavered, as she read it, between heartbreak and vindication, between regret and admiration.&#34;<br /><br />I might say much the same myself, about Gilbert's book.its particular access to grace, summed up beautifully by Alma's reaction to reading THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES:<br /><br />&#34;It was a beautiful book. She wavered, as she read it, between heartbreak and vindication, between regret and admiration.&#34;<br /><br />I might say much the same myself, about Gilbert's book.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|I TOTALLY SEE (AND MOSTLY AGREE) WITH WHAT THE FILM MAKERS ARE TRYING TO DO HERE.  CLARK NEEDED TO MAKE A CHOICE TO COMMIT HIMSELF TO HIS \\"NEVER ENDING BATTLE\\".<br /><br />IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT MOST PEOPLE TODAY (INCLUDING HIS WRITERS AT DC COMICS)DO NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH SUPERMAN ANYMORE. A WELL ADJUSTED, MENTALLY STABLE HERO SEEMS OUT OF PLACE IN THESE JADED TIMES.  MANY CONSIDER SUPES TO BE NO LONGER RELEVENT.  NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.  THE MESS THIS WORLD IS IN CRYS OUT FOR SOMEONE LIKE SUPERMAN.<br /><br />MY ONE ISSUE WITH THE FILM IS THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS, SUPERMAN ALWAYS HAD A SENSE OF FUN TO HIM.  EVEN \\"SUPERMAN RETURNS\\" WAS FUN, IN SPITE OF IT'S PLOT PROBLEMS.  THIS FILM STILL HAS ONE OF THE BEST \\"CATCH FALLING AIRPLANE\\" EPISODES, OR THE ACTION 1 HOMAGE.  \\"MAN OF STEEL\\" WAS NOT FUN.  I MISSED THE \\"YOU GOT ME! WHO'S GOT YOU!?\\" MOMENTS. MY ONE PLEA TO THE FILM MAKERS---PLEASE, LIGHTEN UP!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app is very handy to have but i would prefer another version for free other then the king james.

B004H1V5RU|4.0|The plastic ball looks like it is fragile and would break very easily, but we have had this toy for at least a year, and it is still in one piece (and that is with small children in the house). It is just important to tell the kids not to play with it like a normal toy. The mazes are very challenging. Only one person in our house has gotten through the entire maze. The rest have not, and not for lack of effort! You can only stand a few minutes of playing with this maze at a time, or else you will get extremely frustrated.
B0043VDIAG|1.0|Nicholas Sparks is such a predictable author- this is yet another same old storyline of boy meets girl, bit of action/twist with a love triangle then they live happily ever after. I had to force my way through this book.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|cant get through fast enough this game is so much fun I cant put it down the graphics are great.cant wait to see more.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Wow, having just finished the book I am in awe. Gorgeously written, characters developed so well you feel you actually know them, relationships between the characters incredibly real and a great plot as well. I hated for it to end! Great fiction, I truly appreciate the talent of the author.

817224164X|5.0|fast delivery! nice print! the book itself will beside all the historic facts known its a very boring book. but I still recommend to read it so you don't miss out on history.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a typical city building game, and that's good, because I like them, but like the rest, I'd prefer a Facebook free version, where you could earn more investment tickets without having to post so much on fb. Also, there's not as much hints and tips as the others, so the learning curve is a bit steeper.
B009NY43NY|1.0|What a crap ending to a fun series.  Called the end result several books ago.  Seems that Charlaine was just tired of writing the Sookie series, so she just gave up and sent her off with a whimper.  Very disappointed!
B00000DHR0|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  I can listen to it over and over again.<br />I would highly recommend it.  Makes a great Christmas gift.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Wonderful, I am happy with this purchase.  Its good to see these adventures again.<br />Its better than before, colors just pop, and the picture is sharp, and clear.<br />I would  speak well about  this box set.
B001UV4XX8|1.0|FREE DISSAPOINTMENT WITH THE PURCHASE OF THIS MOVIE! GUARANTEED!!!!<br />This has got to be one of the crappiest movies that Cameron Diaz has ever made.

B00B7VZN76|5.0|By season 3 things were really starting to click. I already have a DVD copy of all 7 seasons. But the COLOR of the Blu-Ray alone makes it worth the price, not to mention the enhanced clarity and sound.
B00FJ7YDV6|5.0|My almost 3-year old loves playing this game on my Kindle.  There are just enough words on the pages to tell the story but not too many to lose interest in listening.  He loves the interaction with the trains!  This is a go-to app that he plays over and over again.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|My husband and I first saw this guy on HBO and subsequently bought his CD's and the documentary, &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34; we watched.  What an incredible story.  We bought this CD and &#34;Cold Fact&#34;.. great!
0345803507|5.0|Great read.  I loved the story of this book.  Yes, it is full of sex BUT it also has a story line that is a page turner under all the smut.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Got to admit that Stryper hit the highest mark!  Very solid album.  I am blazing the music once again in my JBL's again!  I am a veteran rocker that has all sorts of new and old s***.  This is a very solid solid CD.  If MTV was still real instead of reality shows, Stryper would be a top video hit.  They are kicking ass....Move over Motley Crue. You had your ass kicked.  Very good message too.  Can't wait to check them out on the road.  Don't forget south Texas!
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Awesome Movie Pack !!! Always loved this movie now i can watch it anytime i like. The packaging is pretty cool !!

B002T9H2ME|5.0|This movie was not at the cinema, if you really like Sci-Fi you will enjoy it. The movie Oblivion with Tom Cruise took the core argument from Moon, of course they added Mr. Tom, special effects, more action and for sure they had much more $$$ to put into the movie. Great movie, is more than beautiful actors and special effects.
B00BPFWZHU|5.0|I always love it when I find a nice, quick read that makes me feel good! Darrin Mason does an excellent job of asking The Universe questions we'd all like to ask...and getting intelligent, down to earth, practical, uncomplicated answers. Answers we can all live by. I enjoyed reading this book. It reminded me of what is really important in our lives and how we can live to be happier, peaceful people. Everyone should read this, no matter what their religious beliefs.

B0035XVVDY|4.0|Intense Movie, interesting story.  If you like a twisted thriller type movie, you would most likely like this one.  I would watch it again.
B0000026NC|5.0|I have always loved anything by Pink Floyd, and when i seen this CD at a reasonable price....I had to add it to my collection. I wore out 3 double cassette's of this album alone back in the day. It always takes me back to the days...when it was all about the music, and not the gimmicks. I would recommend this CD to any music lover, and i would recommend this seller for any/all music needs.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It might not have been well-written, but it was definitely entertaining.  I will be reading and re-reading...and re-reading...and...well you get my point :-)

B00006690F|5.0|Was a little Leary about by a used CD, but this seller delivered as promised....very little scratches (did not effect play ability), and it also came with a bonus DVD to watch as well. Being from MI. i love listening to all/most of the artists from my state...and Eminem happens to be one of them. I would recommend this seller to anyone for theri musical listening needs. I would recommend this CD to any music lover.

B00DAPOHU6|4.0|I'm a real Jack Johnson fan and have all his albums.  This one is good, but perhaps not my favorite.  And it is so short!
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|Yes I enjoyed this book very much. Having spent some time on the coast as a child some of the places and name were extra special. It has left me with a longing to return. If I did it will be a shame not to meet the characters from this book, all of them so real
1936891026|4.0|The book was so inspiring. I wish they would put this on the high school reading list. Fly like a bird!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Simple straightforward and so far I haven't accidentally deleted anything I don't want to delete. I like the option to review videos prior to deleting them.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I was dying to know his secret...once I found out, I couldn't put the book down... It was well written w/ both the humor of everyday life and how things can change so quickly and how this family copes ...good read
B007T99ENE|3.0|Well written & good story, I prefer lighter simpler stories without politics. The main character being a bit of a bookworm did appeal to me (also being a bookworm)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a great book because it was very consistent with the caricatures. A little here a little there, it was amazing.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Love it.  Easy to use  and customize.  Colorful and easy on the eyes. Want to see more of it so I can explore.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|One of the worst high-budget movies i have ever seen. sorry, Will, but your son is too inexperienced to carry such a movie. send the kid back to acting school. this movie was atrocious. bad script, plot holes everywhere, bad acting, bad directing. just bad.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love my Chromecast. I have had it for several weeks now and I use it everyday. It's extremely simple and works flawlessly between my phone, computer, and TV. I plan on buying more of these for my other TV's for the great functionality at a great price. The functions of this device are going to get better and better, I can't wait to see what else Google does with it.
B00FIUO8MI|2.0|picked it up just because of the hype. this is my rating of the trilogy, not just the last book. i kept reading, hoping it would get better, but the last book, which usually has to be the best, was so boring that made me feel sorry for picking up the trilogy in the first place.<br />unbelievable what a hype can do to the book. this was plain boring.
0891419063|5.0|most people will never know what price that was paid for our freedom and the hell these men went through, they went as boys and came back as old men
0792839749|5.0|Love this movie, they don't make family movies like this anymore. My 2 1/2 yr old grandson stopped playing and watched it.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|I love that this movies teaches all of us to look beyond our circumstances to what really matters.  My 6 year old daughter loved it, too.  The imagination scenes were a stark contrast to the dark, daily life the girls had and my daughter picked up on that fact.
B00G4I0DNG|5.0|Very good! Realistic! You won't go to sea world after this. At least I hope so!<br />It will open your mind.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Enjoyed every page of this book!  It was a little predictable toward the end of the book but it didn't make any difference.  This is pure John Grisham style.
B00FGM0JTY|5.0|Delightful story, well told, well shot, and well put together. I'm astonished I'd never before heard this story. Wonderful music.
B001F6TXME|1.0|By the description given with this product, I thought this item was compatible with my nikon camera. The connection ports are slightly different. Now that I have opened this product, I am unable to return it. :(
B00EUUJID6|5.0|I've seen these boys in person, but the CD was better than seeing them in a crowded venue. Their music is pure and absolutely beautiful!
B00F1W1SS0|3.0|The band is always generous in their DVDs production and here in Luna Park is no exception with more than 3 hours of music, a documentary, behind the scenes and a nice multi-angle feature of one song. First thing that strikes me when I put the Blu-Ray on was the crystal clear picture quality. The sound is also clear, but the mix could have been better for John Myung and Jordan Rudess instruments, who are buried in the mix. Let say that the camera don't focus very often on John Myung. The surround mix is mostly for ambiance and for the James Labrie's vocals.<br /><br />The set list contains many songs from \\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\\", that is not one of my favorites CD of the band. Those songs have been spread out in the main feature with 2 hours and forty minutes and as a bonus of 6 more songs. Usually I don't enjoy a drum solo, even those of Neil Peart, but here, I found that Mangini did something that captivate me, go figure what it is! James Labrie's vocals are clear and strong and he was very generous and emotional on his compliments about Jordan and John Petrucci, when it was time to both of them to do their solos. Again John Myung was left out as it is in many bands, who want hear a bass solo?<br /><br />I am pretty sure that plenty will enjoy this DVD, especially if you enjoy most of the Dream Theater's CDS, including the latest one, but to me, I think that the band is starting to repeat themselves. The similarity of some song structures in their latest CDs is too obvious that you could think that their best day are something from the past. However this is a good concert, the music is still better than many of that genre of progressive metal. Good, but not essential in your Dream Theater collection.3.4 stars
B004FOA84A|3.0|The puzzles were very easy and the game was way too short for a paid game. It took me about a half an hour to complete and when I reached the end, I was surprised that it was over. It was very similar to many escape games that can be found for free online. If it was free I would have given it a 4, couldn't give it a 5 either way because there just wasn't enough to it. I only gave it a 3 because it looked good and even though the puzzles were too easy, they were cute and fun.
0525425772|5.0|It was as well written as any Grisham and the mystery fun, intriguing with just enough legal jargon to educated me as well...  I love the way Grisham writes!
0670033375|5.0|This is the follow up book to Jared Diamond's  \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\".  \\"In Guns, Germs and Steel\\" he discusses the geo-factors that enabled Europe to dominate the world for a few hundred years.  In \\"Collapse\\" he shows how people's behaviors make the difference between a society's success or failure.<br /><br />He looks at the current situations in Rwanda, Haiti, Australia, China, and the state of Montana and then compares them to  ancient societies that collapsed due to environmental failure;  Easter Island, the Anasazi of the Southwestern US, the Mayans of the Yucatan, and the Norse of Greenland.  These ancient cultures depleted their natural resources and then disappeared from the face of the earth. Diamond believes that these collapses were not inevitable.  An example of this is the survival of the Intuit society that occupied the same general area the Norse Greenlanders who didn't survive, even though they had been there for 500 years.<br /><br />He discusses civilizations successful addressing of crisis in a top-down matter such as the deforestation that was turned around in Japan early in Tokugawa Era (1603-1867) and in bottom up as was done in-the New Guinea highlands and contrasts how their management of their environments contrasted to the collapsed civilizations.<br /><br />Diamond's hypothesis is that historically, societal collapse can been attributed to one or more of these factors:<br /><br />Deforestation and habitat destruction,<br />Soil problems (erosion, salinization, and soil fertility losses),<br />Water management problems,<br />Overhunting,<br />Overfishing,<br />Effects of introduced species on native species,<br />Human population growth,<br />Increased per-capita impact of people.<br /><br />To these Diamond adds four factors that are a product of our modern society. They are:<br /><br />Human-caused climate change<br />Buildup of toxic chemicals in the environment<br />Energy shortages<br />Full human utilization of the Earth's photosynthetic<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts, the first part is a short discussion of the environment in Montana. Part two covers societies which have \\"collapsed\\"in history.  Part three looks at current societies which are in danger of causing their own collapse.  In part four Diamond looks at why societies make decisions that lead to disaster.<br /><br />Diamond concludes the book with a summary of the most serious problems facing us today and the negative impact to us if we don't solve them.  He does gives us some reasons to hope because of the examples of societies faced with collapse that addressed their problems and survived.
014241722X|5.0|I saw that Grisham had written some 'kid' level books, and having read all his adult level books I just had to see what these were like. I bought all 4 and read them all within a few days. I loved them!! I wanted more!!
B003B02O0A|5.0|Excellent writing!  I actually saw the movie first, found it so moving that I had to read the book.  And it's of course even better!
014242613X|5.0|I loved this book for its interest holding ability and the fun family ideals as well as always... it had lawyer stuff...  I adore all legal mysteries like Perry Mason... and though this was targeted towards a younger audience... I loved Alfred Hitchcock's The Three Investigators. I just love a good mystery..
B006H5120E|5.0|OMG, this should be the standard for all 3D conversions. It will make you want to watch this movie again and again.  It's a whole new viewing experience.  Just get it.
B004DMNT2W|5.0|It´s perfect, Lowepro is always perfection guaranteed. I have a Canon HF M500 camcorder and it fits perfect.<br />Excellent materials, very well made. I love it.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I love watching this show.  Why did it get cancel? The DVD was good.  Did it's job.  I think blu ray might be better.  It wasn't available in blu ray when i was looking to buy, so no comment on the blu ray.
B002OSXDAU|4.0|I enjoy the story line as well as the interesting commentary.  Though I had intended to  read it previously, I had not done so.
1878424319|5.0|I have bought hundreds of copies of this book for family members, friends, and my patients.  Anyone who would like to start a spiritual path and ultimately be truly happy should start with this book.  Start being happy now.
6301955293|5.0|Interesting classic film, with very riske scenes espec for 1967,  it certainly takes one back to a different time and set of values and psychology. Good product good delivery.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Ok so look  at the top left corner on the snapshots in the app itself, it's that chicks 18'th kindle!!!
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|Worked well but my cow would do better and it confused me at first but it was really not hard after I was able to look at.
B00DBQ0E2E|5.0|Old-school heavy metal with a modern sound. What's not to like? Highly recommendable for die-hard metalheads, get ready for some head-banging.
0316055433|3.0|I love this author and all 3 of her books are worth reading. I was so close to rating this book a 5 star masterpiece till the last 10 percent. The  book is so intelligent and sensitive to art and the thrill of desolate beauty yet entertaining with great characters but the last bit was a let down. The end is satisfying as far wrapping up the narrative but is also filled with explanations, justifications and loopy philosophizing...completely unnecessary. Where was the editor?
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed reading it so much I hated to finish.  I sympathized with each wife's story and could imagine their emotions.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Zombie movies all look the same to me, this one is just more exaggerated. reminds me of obama-care, far fetched!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I had to get a new kindle and had to start game over lost everything Fun but a little expensive for me
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing! I laughed, I cried, I thought, I felt...sometimes you just get to read a book that hits you in the heart. This is one of those books. Thank you!
B00BTZNEN0|4.0|Great Vocals, creative song writing. Counting Stars and Preacher are classics.  Haven't spent too much time on it yet so I am sure I will discover more.  Buy the Album and dig in.
0316055433|5.0|It makes me feel like I am sinking into a pool of poetic quicksand.  I am taken away from my own life and into The Goldfinch each time I open the book.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Love it one of the all time favorites. Recommend it for all great classic movies for the family to enjoy.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|One of the most fulfilling movies which provides a small window into situations which are part of everyone's life, either directly or indirectly.<br />You will laugh and cry!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Great movie great quality. One of the all time favorites to watch. Would recommend for all to watch any given day
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Quentin Tarantino makes the best movies and Django is the best of the best. This movie has it all. If you're a Quentin Tarantino fan this is a must see.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun to play and colors are bright.  This game is quick to respond and easy to see on my Kindle Fire HD.  Will be buying more of this manufacturer's games.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|The beginning was a bit slow but the story got better and I couldn't put it down!<br />Highly recommend this to anyone :)
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I love the Lost series. All of the seasons so far have been well worth watching and I'm looking foward to seeing Season 5. This is a great show and definitely keeps your interest!  I would recommend this show to everyone!
B004EF65QA|5.0|This is a series that is not to be missed. The characters are complex, the acting superb and the casting spot on. The loyalty, love, caring and intent grab you during this wonderful saga. People are complex and what you see is not always what things turn out to be. Truth, values, family, friendship are all very important and worth working towards.
B005J4ASDG|5.0|I love this!  I'm a big fan of Howard Shore's score from the original movies. I listen to it all the time! A definite recommendation for anyone who loves orchestral music! I love every one of the songs and it is very relaxing to listen to.  I give it 5 stars!!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I had first started to watch an older version of this story and was not a fan. I stumbled upon this newer version and loved it from the very beginning. The characters are interesting and provide good back ground for what is to become. Some lie, some cheat, some are naive for a time. Learning some history is a bonus. There are so many parts of history that are fascinating and yet rarely talked about. Appearance for appearance sake is always a theme in life, especially for the well known and well off.
0800141660|5.0|I love this movie!  It was a heart touching, beautiful, funny, movie. I am a huge fan of Sense and Sensibility and my absolute favorite movie is Pride and Prejudice. The cast is amazing and the stories about the two sisters are wonderful and something that anyone can relate too. This movie will touch all of your emotions. I would highly recommend it.
B001NFNFNA|4.0|A true story thaty engrosses, agrivates and maddens. Jolie shines in this one.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|I guess I watched The Wrath of Khan so many times (my favorite of the Shatner S/T flicks) that this re-hash of the plot line didn't do a whole hec of a lot for me.  Nice special effects, but other than that....if I had to do it over, I'd have passed on this one.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|This a great dvd that I wanted to add to my collection. It arrived quickly. The dvd and case are in perfect condition. I am a happy guy, Thanks
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I didn't think I would care for this flick, just based on all the hype.  I was wrong.  This is an excellent flick worth every penny.  I was absorbed into the story early, and the film kept me engaged if not riveted for much of the duration of the film.  One observation I will make is that the plot is vaguely reminiscent of the Arnold Schwarzenegger flick The Running Man.  However, while the Arnold flick (done relatively cheesily in comparison) was a parody with a multitude of tongue-in-cheek moments, the Hunger Games is quite serious, and offers a fascinating narrative.
B001LX2J22|5.0|The beat goes on as Hopkins plays the serial killer whoi outsmarts the police and psychologists and psychiatrists once again, A thrill ride of suspense.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Cool.<br /><br />Cool, cool, cool.<br /><br />I'm probably not the only person to give it this review, but oh well. I like it.<br /><br />Hi, Dan Harmon! Get back to work.
B00C6F61BE|5.0|Thrilling, riviting, involving and maddening. A mind trip into the real terrorists that are among us!  Leaves you with a sour taste and a frantic conclusion. Don't miss this one.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is by far the best bingo and slot game that I have played.<br />The only problem is the freezing up during playing and you loose the coins/balls and winnings :(  Buffalo Studios does send you balls for your problems, I just wish it was the amount you lost.  All Ana all its a great game and I love it :)
B000M5AJQI|5.0|Drama, intense situations, top notch acting and a suspenseful crime story are all here for you, with surprises and thrills as well.
0312588887|5.0|The price and condition were excellent.  I'm more than 1/2 way through the book and wish I had more time to read.  It is over 800 pages but every page is great.  Good story, Great author.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It worked,  but picture and sound &#34;stuttered&#34; badly when I tried to run a streaming TV station through it to our TV set.  It may not have been the fault of the Chromecast, since it may just have been overloading our modem/router, which also was bringing the internet into my computer. But it wasn't doing the job I bought it for, so I returned it,  which Amazon took care of with absolutely no hassle.<br /><br />There wasn't enough information about this gadget available.  It proved impossible to set it up even from the Chrome browser in my computer, since I am running Windows XP and XP is not supported for the Chromecast.  (&#34;Yet&#34;?)  So I borrowed a laptop that ran Windows 7 to set it up, and then it proved I could only use it from THAT laptop even after it had been set up.
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|I had very high expectations for this album and am a little disappointed. Hopefully her next album will be better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addicted sometimes I wish I never started playing it but I cant wait till I have mire lived to plsy
B002VRZEYM|1.0|i thought this movie focused on all the negative aspects of the mass production of food. It didn't speak about the stomachs that were filled by this easily made food. This film is just a sad excuse to complain. I thought that it was very biased video. and i remain convinced that it's obvious that they only made so that they complain about unimportant subject while completely ignoring real political problems. Just think about the amount of lives saved by fast food.If they shut down mass producing meat plants, than thousands upon thousands of children would die because their parents can't afford to buy normal food. this movie wasted my time. If i could rate it zero i would!!!
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|At first my daughter didn't want to have this doll as she doesn't like pink. I ordered it for my friend's daughters, mine saw it and changed her mind. As a result I ordered those dolls for her and for all the friend's children loving Monster High (who don't speak English or don't have cards valid to pay abroad)<br />The doll is really beautiful. I like it's ears pink inside, it's &#34;broken mirror&#34; design of boots and clothes,  long hair and little pink nose...
B0002BO05S|5.0|Great story.  Love the story of Christ and all He endured for the world.  Everyone should watch it for spiritual growth.
B00FFVB2DI|5.0|GREAT COMEDY for the whole family!!! Each season keeps getting better!! Everybody is great!! Love Lily! Love Modern Family! A+
B000BYAD3O|5.0|The 2005 Japanese remaster for this late 1970's title is very good. It does sound \\"juiced up\\", but not to the point of being a compressed mess. I purchased this title and Toto I from a Japanese retailer called \\"FA Store\\" from outside Sapporo, Japan. It was the real deal and was not a cheap bootleg. The sound quality is comparable (if not identical) to the 2003 Toto Essential release.<br /><br />The recording of the bottom-end frequencies in the 1970's was a hard, muffled and constrained sound, so it would be difficult to re-emphasize those frequencies to sound \\"fat\\" in an earlier remaster w/o it bleeding into the higher frequencies. I suppose that the limited production resources for the first release were the root of the problem here...however, the overall quality of this Toto IV remaster is an improvement over the remaster of the first release and sounds \\"fatter\\" and more current. Both remasters are definitely worth purchasing!<br /><br />I waited one month for this title to come to the U.S. (by a slow boat, I suppose)but I have to say it was well worth it. Expedited shipping would have cost more than the CD's themselves, so I had to be patient.<br /><br />The lyrics were included as well.<br /><br />Toto I was also well worth the investment. I spent $42 USD for both titles and shipping, so I didn't have to break the bank for<br />these rare remasters that aren't available in the U.S.
0470449764|3.0|The price for this book was great. I was expecting it to be in better condition.  I did purchase it used, however, the condition described was not the condition of the book that I received.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|This book has a lot of great practical ideas for change, backed up by fascinating research.  I love it.  The concepts apply to anyone involved with social activism, business improvement, or personal development.  And the way that the information is laid out is very user friendly.  I already read the print version of \\"Switch,\\" and now I am listening to the audio version.
0812986180|5.0|I looked for it after I saw the Netflix serie, I haven't finish it, but as long as I know I really like it, it's completely different from the show but both are pretty good.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|finally available on KF! so much easier on the eyes.  thought I was going to go blind playing on my phone!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy playing, but I wish you knew the current status in the game.  It's hard to plan a strategy.
B008NMT684|5.0|My two year old grandson loves this. I was amazed how quickly he caught on how to do the puzzles and also to skip the ones he doesn't want to do. (of course he is a genius) We've been playing with this for months and he prefers it over all of the other apps I've downloaded for him. Even though he can't quite articulate the words yet, he can point out for you the different trucks, firetruck, cement truck, dump truck etc. The best way I've found to make him cuddle up in my lap, if you don't get his complete attention he's off and running.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this series and the second book is so good! I was almost in tears when it was over
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|Overall a good movie but the blu-ray disc had many blacked out image throughout the film. Reached Amazon for a replacement and apparently the whole batch have the same technical problem so buyer beware. DVD disc works fine.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is a great game. I LOVE the gems that allow a second chance. However the mines are more difficult than they should be. It is extremely difficult to turn the cart, and it often thinks that you are ducking when you are tilting. Otherwise, I LOVE this game!!!!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|This movie, while not a blockbuster, was such a sweet, wonderful movie.  I enjoyed it so much I have given it to several people.<br />I also watch it over every once in a while.  I have grown to love books and information about Beatrix Potter.  Heartwarming!
B001AQIYJC|3.0|Part of the story was wonderful - especially the chemistry between the stars, but the movie itself was, for me, rather dark, especially the end.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|A little slow at first, but action picks up half way through the movie then it's non- stop.  Entertaining movie
0316069353|5.0|I'm not particularly fond of courtroom dramas -- they get tedious -- but this book kept me up late one night, and no book has done that since I read Steig Larsson's \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\" A pace that rarely slowed, and plot twists that left me thinking, Holy crap! I would prefer less passive voice and more \\"showing\\" rather than \\"telling.\\" But overall a book I believe any fan of crime fiction would enjoy.
B00FRMDH7Y|2.0|Ok for the kids. By no way a classic or worth watching 25 + times like Cars or Monsters, Inc.
0385532458|1.0|IMHO, the only reason this book got published is because of the author’s name. I found most of these stories lackluster and unfulfilling. I can name several unpublished authors with much better material than this. The publisher should have saved the trees and left this stuff in Grisham’s desk drawer.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Just finished the book this afternoon.  it was an easy read, however, it gave great insight into a part of the world that is little understood by most of Western civilization.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|I wanted to see the movie because I read the book in school. I didn't like the movie any better than the book. Its a good movie to see on Amazon and I'm glad I didn't see it in the theater. The quality of the stream from Amazon was, as usual, excellent.
B00E6895M6|2.0|Debut release from band out of Glasgow, Scotland of light, bouncy synth-pop for dancing on<br /> bubblegum clouds with Blondie, Human League, Depeche Mode, the Chromatics & the Archies.<br />  Includes members from Aereogramme & the Twilight Sad.  A lot of people seem to like this, and<br /> really I can't think of anything to say about it that wouldn't make them angry, so I won't (because<br />  you don't want a bunch of 14 year olds mad at you).
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it and enjoyed it even more watching with my 4 year old. I was a little worried he'd be scared of monsters in his closet... but we're good it seems! We watched it twice this weekend and he's already asked again.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Clear,  easy to understand-navigate.  Information can change your life if you apply it.  Information at the tips of your fingers!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|An excellent novel in the true Follett tradition. Well researched and fast paced, the character development is excellent, It's hard to put down.
B00F2362IE|1.0|Bought this game on my kindle for my children to play!  I am not sure if you have to actually have internet access to play it or not.  i have downloaded it to the device several times.  It will work for a few minutes and then quits running and won't load.  has done this several times.<br /><br />I do not have this trouble with other games that I have downloaded.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The best word I can use for Firefly is &#34;sweet.&#34; You can't help but love these characters. It's a shame there is only one season.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|It was amazing for my grandson!  It looked the same as the game, enjoyed the challenge of micro-blocks, and easily changeable to fit various scenarios in the game.
B00EI2Y4MQ|5.0|This calculator does take precedence into account! 2+4&times;6=  26!!  check - I'm good - I will be deleting my old calculator app pronto!
B00EI2Y4MQ|2.0|This is a unique calculator app because of the feature allowing the user to move a cursor and edit one character at a time. It also has different background colors including pink, rubyred, and &quot;rightgreen&quot;. However, I will not be replacing the calculator app I already have on my home screen with this one.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|As ever this show is very funny.  If you are a fan, and you prob are if you are buying the 6th season, then this won't disappoint you.  Tons of laughs and all the characters get more fleshed out.<br /><br />There is also a nice special guest appearance by Bob Newhart, which was a great episode.<br /><br />Also who doesn't love Sheldon?!!<br /><br />It's a show you can watch several times and still find it laugh out loud funny.  I highly recommend it.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|Package was perfectly packed. No dents or scratches on the box. Figure is on the tiny side but came with everything it said it would. The direction are hiding behind the decorative cardboard backing so don't miss it. Faceplate is a little difficult to remove but all the parts fit perfectly together. Very easy to put her in all the traditional Sailor Moon poses.
B008393Q2O|2.0|This app doesn't work all that well. It does a force close almost every time I use it. There are two modes - the &#34;view&#34; mode and the &#34;edit&#34; mode. In &#34;view&#34; mode, the items you've crossed off in &#34;edit&#34; don't show up as crossed off, only as a lighter font. This might be personal preference, but I'd like to see item crossed off if I've crossed them off, it's just a better visual. I'm still hoping to find a better app for keeping a list of the books I want to read in order.
1250038820|5.0|Thought provoking, lovely photos and stories about people.......everyday people - amazing how these people opened up to Brandon to share
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I was ONE GAME from beating all the levels and this app stopped working. I'm hoping I can go back in sometime and try to finish that last game
B00E00P5JC|5.0|Loved this movie in the theater and loved watching it again.  Very funny fun movie for the whole family.  Good story about being able to do anything you set your mind to.
B008JFUS0U|5.0|Thor Dark World is the second in the Marvel Universe of great comics films. Marvel continues their excellent portrayal of their universe picking up where we left off with the last Avengers film.<br /><br />Family:<br /><br />Loki clearly has family issues. His father is disgusted with him, considering that Loki’s fate should have been dying on one of the Nine Worlds than being taken in by Asgard. Loki is jealous of Thor, cannot be trusted and has several tricks that are evident in the film.<br /><br />Loki’s ability to trick through changing his appearance is used to great effect. Hilarious scene where he changes into Captain America!<br /><br />The tension between Loki’s mother Frida and his brother Thor is quite intense at times and lends some realism to this fantasy tale.<br /><br />Odin:<br /><br />The All Father gets to shoot a few power blasts at the Dark Elves, gives us a closer look at the mythology of the time. Really liked that the film went more for the Asgard realm and the mythology of the time rather than staying mostly on small-town Earth.<br /><br />Malekith:<br /><br />Not a bad villain. He’s the leader of the Dark Elves, and the actor who portrays this character is trying to play it cool and subdued. But I like my villains active and energetic than subdued. My Marvel fan friends took offense on how Malekith is portrayed. But heck, it’s fiction, right? Malekith wants to collapse the Nine Worlds and after thousands of years (great back story) he makes another try at it.<br /><br />Jane Foster inadvertently loses the Aether, an interesting “Tesseract” of power, that some internet blogs figure might lead us to the other Marvel tales of the Infinity Gauntlet. Perhaps so. This stuff is pretty evil; I don’t understand why Jane could not have used it against the Elves but that’s fine.<br /><br />Romance:<br /><br />Yeah, a bit of that. We have a few scenes between Thor and Jane. Even between Jane’s assistant and her intern.<br /><br />Comedy:<br /><br />The director really went overboard on the comedy. I don’t mind one or two scenes to break up the seriousness of the story, but a new skit every five or ten minutes was a bit much, but I feel that’s really a matter of taste.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Great fight scenes, though it was disturbing to see Thor being mopped up all over the place. The overall themes of family, of betrayal and of love & honor were well-displayed. Can’t wait for the final film in the trilogy.<br /><br />There are two extra scenes at the credits and after the credits. Don’t miss them!<br /><br />Recommended.medy:<br /><br />The director really went overboard on the comedy.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I was at dinner with my family when my stepmom brought up this book and, more specifically, how it is a now also a movie and that my twin 13 year old sisters want to see the movie. She said that she wanted them to read the book first. Based on our discussion of the basic premise of the book I came home and bought it and read it.<br />Narrated by Death, the book seems far from the movie production (I watched only the preview for the movie once I had finished the book). Death follows our heroine through most of her life and he is also attending to the dead.<br />Zusak creates a convincing portrait of Nazi Germany, and also manages to create sympathy for Death.<br />Death talks about the different places WWII calls him to, the beaches at Normandy, and, most memorable for me, the bombing of Cologne where Death says &#34;Five hundred souls. I carried them in my fingers, like suitcases. Or I'd throw them over my shoulder. It was only the children I carried in my arms.&#34;<br />An infinitely moving and hopeful book.<br />As for my 13 year old sisters? I'd let them see the PG - 13 movie, but the book is much darker and more true territory,
B003B02O0A|5.0|The story that made John Grisham. His first book still ranks as his best. Now, we have the sequel in 'Sycamore Row'. Read this one first and then you will be ready for more stories from Ford County.
B00FMF3R0I|5.0|At long last, a \\"NEW\\" Beatles album is available again. This time, it is two albums in one. 1994's \\"Live At The BBC\\" and its long-awaited sequel companion \\"On Air - Live At The BBC, Volume 2\\". Both are remastered for superior sound quality. The Beatles recorded several radio programs for the British Broadcasting Corporation from 1962 to 1965. Throughout their time on the BBC airwaves, they performed many outstanding tracks; several were original compositions and a great deal more were cover tunes that were first written and performed by other artists. This 4-disc, double CD set comprises many of these classic recordings that were exclusive to BBC radio listeners during the sixties. The end result is a unique treasure trove of music that still remains a vital force in popular culture, even 50 years later. There are songs that were featured in their 2 films \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"Help!\\"; live tracks performed in front of an audience; alternate versions of many of their hits; and a brilliant assortment of cover songs that showcased the group's remarkable talents. Even more amazing is the amount of songs the band performed for BBC radio that were not officially and formally recorded at any proper EMI sessions. In addition to all of the great music, there are special in-studio banter between the group and their respective radio hosts that display their own free-wheeling sense of humor. The boys cut loose and retain an air of freshness that still sounds as good now as when it first happened. Altogether, you can not go wrong with this double-dose of BBC radio classics. While the members of this group would eventually embark on their own successful solo careers after they disbanded in 1970, what you have here is the sounds of a group that knew how to please and entertain an audience with their catchy melodies and genuine British charm. This is a great way to help celebrate the group's 50th anniversary. \\"Live At The BBC\\" is music that will breathe a dose of fresh air from your speakers into your hearts.your speakers into your hearts.

B00EW9GQR6|1.0|First of all I have to say that I was never gaga's BIGGEST fan. I always thought she was a bit over the top and just overrated.<br />However, there were always several songs from ALL of her previous albums that I loved, and still love to this day.<br />But upon hearing \\"Applause\\", I had a bad feeling about her upcoming album - and that bad feeling was right.<br />The first song on the album, \\"Aura\\"...I honestly can't even put into words what a mess it is. If it's supposed to be art, it's actually the farthest thing from it. This song actually makes me laugh because it is just so weird and..well...HORRIBLE.<br /><br />You know I could go on and on about how atrocious this album is, but it would just be far too lengthy and I feel like I'd be wasting my time seeing as all her diehard fans will probably love this CD anyway.<br />But I will say this - I am a huge fan of all different types of music (especially EDM, which she made an absolute JOKE of on this album), but this CD has to be one of the WORST CDs I've heard in a very, VERY long time.<br />Have a listen for yourself if you don't believe me. I played some of the songs to friends and they all had the same reaction I did.<br /><br />I can't even list a few songs that are highlights of the album because there literally are none.<br />But if I had to choose, I would say \\"Dope\\" and \\"Gypsy\\" are among the few decent songs.<br /><br />**Last thing I would like to say - we all know what a mess Miley Cyrus has become these days...but I have her recent album as well, and I have to say that her CD \\"Bangerz\\" is honestly 100 times better than Gaga's \\"Artpop\\". I know, I know, it sounds hard to believe...but trust me, I would be the last person to give Miley Cyrus credit for anything these days. But if you're comparing the two CDs, \\"Bangerz\\" could win a Grammy.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|OMG! Grisham has done it again. This brand new release is an absolute winner. Sycamore Row brings us full circle. Back to<br />Ford County, the scene of Grisham's first book, 'A time to Kill'. Recommend you read A Time to Kill first.

B000FBJHZS|2.0|In general, Very unrealistic scenarios with Bad endings. Although I still like the descriptions of unknown technologies I can't get over how many times Mr Brown used the word &#34;delirious&#34; in this book, the predictable plots and the times it referenced Rachel's personal fear of water.

1455525839|4.0|REVIEWED BY LIZ<br /><br />Although WHITE FIRE is the 13th book in the Pendergast series, it can be read on its own. But I guess it wouldn't hurt to have a few extra details...<br /><br />First thing readers need to know is that FBI Special Agent Aloyisius X. L. Pendergast is a character unlike any I've ever read before. I honestly can't say why or how he has made his way into my psyche, but there he is and I love him. Pendergast is independently wealthy, has contacts all over the place, and pretty much writes his own ticket - he goes where he wants when he wants and investigates what he wants. Pendergast is also magical. No, really, I mean it! He gets out of situations there is absolutely NO escape from, and he figures things out that take such great leaps of deduction, it's mind-boggling. Pendergast may skirt the law a bit from time to time, but he's always able to get the information he needs, and he always saves the day. I honestly cannot imagine a reader not falling under Pendergast's spell. He had me transfixed after only a few chapters many years ago.<br /><br />Here, in WHITE FIRE, Pendergast is back in action. Readers of [[ASIN:B00FOU94DA Still Life with Crows (Preston, Douglas)]] (Book 4) will recognize Corrie, a character introduced in that story. Corrie is really the star of the show here. She's made something of herself, going to the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and working on a thesis. This thesis brings Corrie, and eventually Pendergast, to the town of Roaring Fork, Colorado to investigate the mysterious deaths of several miners over 100 years ago. The deaths are not quite what they seem and, of course, lead to a lot more trouble. Compounding the danger is an arsonist who strikes without warning and, seemingly, without any patterns.<br /><br />I remember liking Corrie when she was a troubled teen in her hometown of Medicine Creek, Kansas, and I like her even more now that she's done a bit of growing up. In this story, there were times that, for me, she pushed the boundaries of what a smart, contemporary woman who is studying criminal justice would do, but I had to remind myself that Corrie hasn't had much in her life. This thesis would do amazing things for her future career, not to mention the scholarship she would win, so I was able to forgive some of her more risky behaviors because I liked how driven she was. I hope we get to see more of her character in the future.<br /><br />WHITE FIRE was a lot of fun to read, and I thought that Pendergast was maybe starting to feel like himself again after his difficulties in the previous few books. As always, I was literally chewing my nails as I approached the final few scenes. Preston/Child books are ones I have to really fight to keep myself from reading the last chapter first, they are THAT suspenseful!<br /><br />Although it's not my favorite Pendergast novel, I think WHITE FIRE is a really great representation of the kind of book that these authors write with their intrepid hero. WHITE FIRE would be a great place for readers new to the series to start and is another great entry in the Pendergast lore!<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />WHITE FIRE is what you get when you combine two talented authors, fantastic, memorable characters, and a plot that defies disbelief in the best way possible. Beware, though - once you get a taste of Special Agent Pendergast, I don't think you'll be able to get enough of him!<br /><br />RATING: A- (4½ stars)<br /><br />NOTE: I received a review copy of this title courtesy of the publisher in exchange for an honest review.r me, she pushed the boundaries of what a smart, contemporary woman who is studying criminal justice would do, but I had to remind myself that Corrie hasn't had much in her life.

B0014DC0AK|4.0|When this came out, I was instantly hooked on it. Abd even invited Heavy Metal novices to listen to it. They really dug it. I loved the artwork so much that I had a transfer on one of my favorite Polo shirts.<br />But in 2013, I now believe this album could have been better, specially when I recently read Gene Hoglan saying he composed a lot but didn't receive credit for it.<br /><br />&lt;&lt;A month after leaving Dark Angel, Hoglan found out Death was looking for a drummer to replace Sean Reinert. Despite mixed past interactions with frontman Chuck Schuldiner, Hoglan flew to Florida and tracked the drums for Individual Thought Patterns in three weeks. While he enjoyed the experience it wasn't quite what he had expected.<br /><br />\\"I thought, `Wow, this is Death. We're gonna put together this ball-crushing, storming death metal album that's gonna stamp everybody else out,'\\" recalls Hoglan. \\"Then Chuck sent me a riff tape that was anything but death metal sounding. When I got to Florida, Chuck sat me down and I learned all the songs on guitar and all the songs were being played way up high on the A string and the high E. So I said, `Hey Chuck, why don't we try taking some of these riffs and playing them a lot lower and making them really chunky?' I transposed a lot of Individual Thought Patterns and hopefully made it sound a lot more powerful.\\"<br /><br />Despite the significant role Hoglan had writing and arranging with Death on Individual Thought Patterns and its 1995 follow-up Symbolic, he was a side man in the band.>> (Source: [...]<br /><br />This pretty sums it all. The sound of Symbolic does not reflect what Death should sound like. It has a lot of melody but has not succeeded to blend it with the aggression that Death Metal should convey. That's not to say that Death should sound evil, but there is something missing or rather something odd. The compos are great, the solos and melodies are well found but the vocal style clearly doesn't fit in here. The music of this album is without a doubt the predecessor of \\"The fragile art of existence\\" but not one where Death vocals are okay. There is clearly too much 'treble' for low-sounding harsh vocals to fit in.<br /><br />I also have another complaint about the copy-paste tendency of recent Death songs. The second part of the songs after the interlude and solos are similar to the first part. This becomes quite evident after ten or twenty times listening to the same album. Contrary to other albums such as Human, the copy-paste formula doesn't work here because the songs are longer.<br /><br />However, Symbolic remains a landmark album with great musicianship. Bobby Koelble is probably one of the best guitarists that performed in Death along with Murphy.<br /><br />It's a pity that Chuck isn't alive anymore 'cause maybe he could have re-released this album with Aymar on vocals. And he would have hit the charts at top 5.is album is without a doubt the predecessor of \\"The fragile art of existence\\" but not one where Death vocals are okay.

B007FKI9G0|4.0|This movie is hilarious!  It captures the jaded cynicism of the rock scene, but then reveals itself as the ultimate parody with dialogue that sneaks up on you.  On top of that, the music is good, too!
0061537969|5.0|Anyone who has ever owned a dog will love this book.  The story is told from the perspective of the dog, Enzo, who is very intelligent.  Since dogs are pure positive love, who never judge us, never hold a grudge, and  treat us like we are the most important person in the world we naturally feel a deep bond with our dog.  In The Art of Racing in the Rain, much of the story is experienced through the thoughts of Enzo, so the reader gets to feel how Enzo feels and understand what Enzo is thinking as the story evolves.  The author does a masterful job of portraying the emotions of the dog, intertwined with those of the human characters with whom he interacts.  This is one of those books that is hard to put down and when it is finished, leaves you yearning for more.
B00B5QGPZC|5.0|Awesome music and very entertaining.  This as good as it gets, unless you're lucky enough to be at one of his concerts.
B006G35EEC|5.0|I enjoyed watching this with my 10 year old boy. And, he really enjoy it!  Older movies are still good for today's generation.

B001NLL93W|5.0|This book is great. Teenage girls would love this book. I loved reading it. Mortal Instruments is the best series ever!
B0015DROBO|5.0|You are captivated from the very beginning of this trilogy.  Extremely well written and very descriptive characters.  The only drawback is the references to the local places in the book which most Americans have never seen.  A good look at another culture.  Certainly worth the price.  Blows the movie away.
1592537251|5.0|I really am enjoying this book.  I am a bit of an art book junkie, I love to draw and in this book it was fun to see how you could journal some big city areas.  It is a big thick book with lots of great art and great information.
B004EPZ0BG|3.0|The title of this movie pretty much describes the dvd in its entirety. However, it is a movie you can sit down in an evening to relax and watch.
B008K8VDPU|3.0|It's a fun app even lets you pay instrumentals of current songs which I find amusing especially when a friend of mine couldn't figure out what song it was but knew she knew it

B002GHHHP6|4.0|A western genre movie, which I like, allowed me to sit down in the evening to relax and enjoy this dvd.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|My son purchased this app using my Amazon points, despite my not being happy with him about that both he and his little brother love this game and spend hours playing it. Though its a little cutesy for my taste I can not argue the fact that it is a fully feature Tower Defense (TD) app, with lots of options, colorful graphics, and hours of game play. My boys absolutely love it!

B00B2PHSIY|2.0|Works great for pictures, but scratched up within a week.  They need some sort of scratch resistant coating for this to be worth while.
B00C78U9HC|5.0|I loved everything about this movie. It was funny, poignant, and Anthony Hopkins should be nominated for an Academy Award for this flawless portrayal of a great Brit that became a loved American. What a wonderful insightful film. I've watched it 3 times already. It's without a doubt, the best movie I've seen in 5or 6 years. I can find enough adjectives to describe how I feel about Hopkins performance;;;and Helen Mirren really shined as well. It's in my top 5 favorite movies of all time;; that's how much I love this film. I'm surprised it did not do better at the box office.  People don't know what they missed. It's as good as his great films.

B003Y74AZ2|5.0|So I was thinking about getting a new Otter box, but I didn't want to spend $30 on a new phone case even if Amazon has a way better price on otter boxs than anyone else.  So I discovered this Amazon Basics cover.  I love Amazon Basic product, and this case is no exception.  The case looks great and does the trick.  I've already droped my phone, and it is still in one piece.  The case is a little loose on the side, but its not a problem at all.  Considering it was only $5 its more than makes up for it.  These are so cheap that I bought a nother style of amazon basics case just to see which one I liked more.  For your information this is the one I prefer, but the other style is also nice.

Buika has a gorgeous voice, but it was not presented to the most interesting advantage here.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Nicely written.  Compelling story line.  The book seems geared more to a younger audience though, which i did not realize ahead of time.  I liked the book and it held my interest but would direct it more towards the younger reader.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Great story line.  Exciting twists and turns.  Easy to read and definitely  held my attention............ until the end.  The ending was such a let down.  It actually baffled me.  I felt this writer had a sharp mind and was truly creative until I got to the end.  It seemed like she ran out of ideas and QUIT!  If I could rate the first three quarters of the book it would have gotten 5 stars but the ending dropped that rating dramatically.  In fact, had I known the ending was that poorly written I would never had paid for or read the book.  Disappointed!!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I could not put it down; which was unexpected because &#34;The Shining&#34; was not one of my favorite Stephen King Books.

I watched the entire season in just a few days and it was so scary and exciting i couldn't wait to see more. I am not sure what the deal is with this current season or why it is just kind of blah but I could see why the first season had everyone hooked!

B006S01GH2|1.0|I didn't finish this movie, There were pornographic scenes of copulating couples.  If I want to be titilated, I certainly won't go watch others have sex.  Our film industry is really blurring the lines between good literary entertainment and seedy peeping-tom stimulation.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|One of my favorite book series. No doubt in my mind that this book series will be placed with the classics and must reads.

B008JFUPOY|1.0|I love the movie... When it works.  This is the replacement movie I reordered.  I popped it into my BluRay and found that it freezes at the exact same point in the movie where the other one froze.  In fact, it crashed my blu ray every time the movie freezes.  I think this is a manufacture defect with this batch.  I am really disappointed.  It freezes at 2 points: chapter 16 during the first scare game challenge and again towards the end after they won the scare games.  I have never had problems with my player or any other blu ray.  I cannot express how disappointed I am with this huge defect.  I am again going to return and just request my money back.  Too bad.  I loved the movie, quality of the disc is just below standards.

B00CO8TA4I|5.0|Great CPU!!! This thing is lightning fast and the integrated graphics look great. I bough this for a machine that just browses the web and sends emails. It may be a little bit of overkill, but it will last a good long time, I'd think. Intel is leaps and bounds ahead of AMD with its technology. AMD processors  may be cheaper, but Intel is so much more worth the investment.

When I first read about The Maze Runner I thought it was going to be a boring retelling of The Hunger Games. Surprisingly, it was the total opposite. Although it does have some characteristics of The Hunger Games, Dashner still managed to make it unique and original.<br /><br />  The Maze Runner is the first book in the New York Times bestselling Maze Runner series. When Thomas arrives at this strange place called the Glade, the only thing he is able to remember is his name. \\"He began his new life standing up, surrounded by cold darkness and stale, dusty air.\\" (Dashner 1) The Glade is a large area surrounded by stone walls with huge doors that open every morning and close every night. Every thirty days a new boy is delivered to the Glade through the lift. Similar to Thomas, the Gladers memories are wiped out. A day after Thomas is delivered, a girl, the only girl to ever arrive at the Glade, arrives with a mysterious message. The innocent, average Thomas might be more significant than he and everyone expected. He must find a way to uncover the secrets hidden inside his mind.<br /><br />  This novel tests the characters courage, cleverness, and will power. All three of these qualities are essential in life. The Maze Runner is not only an enjoyable book but it also teaches a valuable lesson of bravery and determination. Throughout the book Thomas and the Gladers never give up while trying to figure out the secrets outside the walls of the Glade. Overall The Maze Runner is a fantastic novel and I recommend everyone to read it.
B001MM28JG|5.0|If you liked Star Trek or Star Wars or have ever SEEN stars you WILL like this movie! If you want to know if someone has a sense of humor, watch this movie with them. If they DON'T laugh IMMEDIATELY hold a mirror under their nose because they're probably DEAD!!!
B0029XFNA8|5.0|Its a classic.  Had a special visitor for Christmas one year who had lost all of her family in death.  For her this movie was part of Christmas.  So we had to have it.
B001J1K5IG|2.0|I kept falling asleep. I don't think Costner really liked the Earps. TOMBSTONE was MUCH better!!! If you're having trouble sleeping start this one up, but if you plan on WATCHING a movie, pick something else. This would be a GREAT drive-in movie, because you could make out without missing ANYTHING worthwhile!
B004X6PRO6|3.0|I am half way through this strange book. I think I will finish it but it is a struggle. On the plus side, one does get a glimpse of the way life is in North Korea. That in itself is a series of strange, terrible and very bazaar happenings. I suppose it is all based on true facts.<br />On the negative side in my opinion lies in the telling, very confusing, difficult to understand the main character and just when you think you have it all figured out the author has him disappear from the story. I am not a fan of the allegorical and I think this book is full of it, I say think because that too is confusing.  I am determined to finish it but have to wonder how it ever won a Pulitzer Prize. I should get a prize for sticking with it !  I might come back and give it a second review if all of a sudden it improves
B00CHVJODE|5.0|I have not watched this movie as it is a Christmas gift for my daughter, however it arrived in a timely manner as promised and as is often the case, at the time it was the cheapest on Amazon.com compared to other major retailers.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy the game, it gives you so many moves to clear things.  Have to get use to that part of the game.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|This movie is a Christmas gift for my daughter, but I did watch it in the theater whilst I was deployed in the desert. I am not big on animated movies, but it is worth watching. I preordered this movie through Amazon.com and after it shipped I got an e-mail from Amazon saying that the price dropped and I would be getting refunded the difference. The movie arrived as promised which was just a few days after it was released.
B00BATG18K|5.0|This story takes us back and forth in time to explore the life of the Chinese courtesans. Violet and her mother Lucia are trapped in worlds where they both become the victims of men and their not so honorable schemes. Amy once again presents us with a less than perfect mother daughter relationship and the issues presented when families are separated by immigration to the U.S.. Lucia goes to American to find her son that was taken from her, but Violet gets left behind in China and becomes very resentful. The book reveals to us that neither has led  an easy life. Violet becomes trapped in the world of the Chinese courtesans, much like her mother did. We are given a not so pretty picture of what these girls went through.<br /><br />The Valley of Amazement is different from Amy's other books in that it contains many explicit scenes about sex and sexual innuendos. It is descriptive, but tastefully done and not trashy. I think the goal was not to focus on these scenes, but to give a true depiction of what really went on in these houses of pleasure.<br /><br />In the first few chapters I was wondering where this story was going to go, but in the end I was not disappointed. The end was the best part of the book for me. I was a little surprised at the ending. It is not a happy sail off into the sunset ending, but a more realistic finale. All of the things I love and expect from an Amy Tan book were all there, her beautiful writing style, strong women characters, and their struggles. This is not a happy tale, but an important part of the history of the women in China. I was totally engrossed in this book and couldn't wait to finish it. I give this book a 4.5 out of 5.<br /><br />Amy has a great Web page:  [...] There are also many photos and information on her development of this book on the site.
B0014DQSGW|3.0|The movie is cute, but the streaming on Amazon prime was interrupted several times during the viewing.  Will try another movie soon.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|As long as you are patient and strategize as others have suggested it is be fun. I refuse to spend money on games so as long as I'm patient I don't have to. Very good graphics and challenging!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The author simply nails the \\"what if\\" dilemma.  I enjoyed the character development and interaction. Read it in two days..ever so thankful for my new Kindle!<br />Haven't raved about a book since \\"Gone Girl\\".....have told just as many friends about \\"The Husband's Secret\\"!
020530902X|5.0|I am not a proficient writer - certainly not as proficient as I would like to be. A friend recommended this book to me, and within just the first few pages I was transformed. This reference, while small, is dense - each page providing the knowledge and discipline to help us become the best writers we can be. For me it has been an eyeopener, and I plan to reread it again and again for years to come.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Love Castle!  I like that the focus remains on solving crimes and not the relationship between Castle and Beckett. Their relationship has progressed more naturally than a lot of the couples you see portrayed on TV.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loves this book so much bit you might be lost if you didn't read the first one the end of the book really got me so I recommend this book to everyone
B0094BB4TW|4.0|it is a good way to keep in touch with family from all over and to reconnect with friends I haven't seen in years.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|My son is right. This should be required viewing. Archetype of the Speilberg &#34;buddies adventure&#34; and &#34;unlikely friendship&#34; films.<br />And it has Kerri Green :)
B00A285OOW|5.0|Amazing series, so glad I stumbled upon it. The way she tells the story, makes you think you are part of it, like you are right there in the middle of all the action.
B001XV3LSS|4.0|A favorite since it first came out. It struck me that I cannot remember a bad movie that Jodie has been in, not one.<br />Wanna go for a ride??? :-)
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I loved this book!!!! It is why I purchased book number 6- Dancing with Dragons. It is a great series- full of imagination!!!
B008Q08IV4|5.0|Funny and moving film set in some important points in American history. Doesn't rely on the special effects gimmicks, though they were well executed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|addictive game for sure ..about time kindle has it .if we have to pay Im done though<br />#### ## ##
B00FN811SY|5.0|Wow!!!!!!!!!  Cannot believe how nice this is to have.  Really appreciate all the hard work.  Thanks so much for thinking of us and making this so easy to work with.<br /><br />Tracey Williams
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great app extremely addictive.  A friend recommended this to me since then I can't seem to put it down. Great game play.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great movie. I loved it. Full of action. Love all the superheroes. Also funny (Iron Man). Hope there's one more.
B00902AKK4|4.0|fun to play. i like that it requires you to use your brain and have to figure things out. very creative.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pinterest is an interactive app that allows you to pin ideas, things you love, stuff you want to do, and more. I love this app because I can use it to plan for occasions, get and save great recipes, or just create a world I want to live in. If you're big on organization or like getting new ideas from fashion to D.I.Y you'll love this app too.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|We own each season. Because we travel we miss many of the episodes so catch up on the ones we've missed, beside enjoying seeing the others again especially without commercials. We enjoy the actors and dry humor.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is one of the best games I've ever played. Definitely in my top five. The app allows you to sync with your Facebook and see their progress. You can ask your friends for more lives when you run out and they help you advance through levels. Each stage of the game is more challenging and interesting. I was hooked from the start. Thanks King for creating such a terrific game.
B0053O89IS|5.0|We own each season. Because we travel we miss many of the episodes so catch up on the ones we've missed, beside enjoying seeing the others again especially without commercials.
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|The best game ever!!!!!!!!! 2K sports have really outdone themselves this time. This is the best basketball game ever. The End.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Awesome book, very easy read. I found it hard to put down.<br />Really opens up your eyes to how we should be running.<br />Would recommend to new and old runners.
1594202273|4.0|This is  scarry!  Schlosser does a very good job of relating the incidents and accidents that might  very well have  produced a nuclear of thermonuclear explosion.  In addition his narrative concerning the SIOP development over the years makes you wonder what kind of thinking  led to these tactical/strategic decisions.  The narrative does wander somewhat.
B00DGO8CL6|5.0|Great Sweet harmonic and melodic Album.<br />Elton John in his best !<br />Great Printing: clear and balanced. Enjoyable balance between calm songs and rhythm songs
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Have not watched it yet.  But I am sure it will be of the same quality as all DVD's purchased from Amazon
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love suvbway suffers because its challenging and creative.<br />I loved to be challenged because I am smart well math smart and this is \\"think now\\" smart as I like to say.<br />I say this is creative because this is what happens now
B00364K6J2|5.0|GREAT MOVIE!<br />It is such a wonderful movie - for kids and adults!!  It teaches the merits of honesty and good behavior as well as the hurtfulness of bullying.  And, I do love happy endings!
0316204366|5.0|An excellent book.  Well documented!  Easy reading!  Education should take a good long look at the statistics presented here. There was a similar study done on class size in the 1980's that came out with the same conclusions.....
0316322407|5.0|Heartwarming and terrible at the same time.  Not since Anne Frank has there been such a demonstration of courage.  Everyone should read it and at the end of the day, say 'thank you, God, for my blessings.'
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome! Not too easy,, not too hard. I love it, and my kids love it too. My four year old is better than me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun, excellent way to kill time as a passenger on a long road trip or at the airport, or just because!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I've been a Ken Follet fan since reading his book Eye of the Needle.  I loved his books Pilars fo the Earth and World Without End so when I saw that he was doing a series I decided to give them a try.  I have not been diappointed.  He develops characters you want to know more about while weaving in true events.  I've learned many things I didn't know while being very entertained.  The book is long, but worth every minute!  I can't wait to read the third book in the trilogy, Edge of Eternity.
B000V4NX04|5.0|This is the most beautiful and thoughtful movie of the last 20 years.<br /><br />Watch carefully what happens with coats, clothes and other coverings in this movie...
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Happy with my purchase.  Item arrived as expected and video quality was spot on.  I even got a free video rental so I could watch it before it arrived in the mail.
0374533571|4.0|A gut-wrenching yet uplifting and humorous look at real people, and likely circumstances, in the world of blue-collar America. I couldn't help but cheer for the protagonist.
0763644765|5.0|Soooo adorable - my 2 year old LOVES this book and reading about.  It is simple and such a fun little book to year.  Highly recommend for potty training
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Each time I read another Grisham book, I think &#34;This is my favorite.&#34;  This one is no exception, now my new favorite.
B003XYERRM|5.0|Well written, and a very different take on the character of Richard III.  If you like the novels of Phillipa Gregory, you'll also enjoy this.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|An all time great movie I can watch over & over - Maggie is magnificent! I have taken so many people to see this movie & saw it 4 times at our wonderful Tower Theatre - can't &#34;sing&#34; it's praises enough!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I really like playing the game but not the part being asked to pay to continue to play once you get into the games. Free means FREE to me. I would give a 5 star review but I feel They should be up front about wanting payment for part of the game.
B00AMEZZUE|5.0|Fell in love with her character in House of Voices.  Very sweet, wholesome artist/musician/actress. No creepy phoney person is Lou.. love you!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I really like the playing the game but not the 5 lives part. If the game is free why ask for payment after the 5 lives? FREE means FREE to me! They should be truthful  up front about wanting money to play.  I'm just saying...
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Outstanding book! This should go down as one of Stephen King's all-time greats! Very well woven together with The Shining and both riveting and terrifying. King's ability to vividly bring his characters to life never ceases to amaze. Very well done! This is a must read!!!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Bought the app setup it and used it that morning to wake up. I think I'm going to start using it to wake up too now.
B00D1VKZ3M|2.0|So disappointing. I can only assume that the author was out to make a few quick dollars.  To skip over the wedding and babies and then make Bridget a widow was a cheap  cop out.[Not to mention the death of her father] It could have been so much more.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app. Easy to use,  intuitive.  Behaves and looks like full web site.  I find Pinterest very addicting and very entertaining.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So very happy that this is available for my kindle!!! Very addictive and frustrating at times but I love this game!!! I would highly recommended!!
B0042ESTQW|4.0|Since the new Garmin mount allows easy on and off my bike, this cover is a must with my ability to drop things. Fits well on the device but the charging/access flaps are not so easily put back into place after charging. I have to kind of wiggle them into place, but not a big deal, just not as smooth as it could be. This was the only reason why I did not give it 5 stars.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is so addicting.  They come up with new rooms often so you always have things to do. The addition of the slots keeps you there after the credits are spent
B001XULSG6|4.0|Great movie!! Quality was great as well. Would recommend if someone doesnt want to go out and buy it. Fantastic!!!
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|This was a fun series to read, even more than once.  The steampunk style, the comedy of manners, and hilarious, unique, deep characters.
006202406X|3.0|SPOILER ALERT.... DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE FINISHED ALLEGIANT.<br /><br />I bought this book immensely excited, wearing Erudite blue, anxious to read it. I adored Divergent and Insurgent. I would of rated Divergent five stars and Insurgent four. First of all, who is Edith Prior? Will we ever know? I felt Insurgent was a MAJOR cliffhanger and was never fully resolved (though I partially predicted it). I enjoyed a large portion of this book. I'm grateful for Evelyn and Tobias being okay. Tris should not of died. It's fairly simple. If David truly loved Natalie Prior, he wouldn't of killed Tris. I predicted the ending. It was obvious Tris's death was purely for shock factor. You don't NEED shock factor to make a good ending. I think part of the problem is Veronica Roth is only 24, and simply doesn't know how to write a proper ending. Also, keep in mind I am only twelve years old and can tell the difference from a ACTUAL good ending and a ending made just for shock factor. If I could remake the story, Caleb would've been watching Tris on the monitors or something, and he would've rushed in, yelled &#34;NO!&#34; and dived in front of Tris, sacrificing himself for Tris. He would've survived, but he would've became incompetent; kind and peaceful, but practically mindless. More Amity than Erudite. The reason he would've survived is because he had the same serum-resisting genes as Tris. Then Tris would've punched (and knocked out) David, grabbed his gun and shot him (therefore killing him). Tris would've then entered the code and pressed the green button, dragged the un-consious Caleb to the hospital and reunited with Four and Christina. Four and Tris would've became Four and Six. They would've lived happily ever after. Uriah would've still died. There is no logical way for him to live. Christina would've admitted her crush on Uriah. The End.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|The Signature of All Things was a terrific read from page 1 to the final sentence...Elizabeth Gilbert tells a very exciting and believable story one one character in a very large story. Beginning with her father, Henry, and his belief in hard work bringing large monetary rewards, the tale soon picks up on Alma and her very believable and inquisitive mind, also centering on her family, her life's work, and her eventual trip to the south seas seeking answers to questions that wouldn't go away.  I had difficulty in putting this book down for any length of time, and in not allowing myself to skip forward, because missing even a paragraph for me was not a option. I literally did not want to miss a word of this beautifully crafted piece of work. Beautifully done!
B00E66C6L0|5.0|This was purchased for my daughter. It arrived in today's mail and she has been listening to it already and enjoying it.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|While certainly not my favorite Pendergast novel (which remains \\"Still Life With Crows,\\" I found this to be a good book in the series. I was particularly delighted to have found Ms. Corrie Swanson featured so prominently, not seen in such detail since the aforementioned \\"Crows.\\" I successfully guessed the villain's method of demise, and rather enjoyed said demise in spite of being correct. If I have a complaint at all, it relates to Pendergast's role - he is somewhat sparsely featured - almost as a secondary character (with an enticing hint of novels to come featuring perhaps his offspring). All in all, this is a worthy read, and received 4 stars from me due to its seeming brevity (I reached the end in about 2 hours). White Fire would have received 4 1/2 stars if I could have given the half...
B000GB775E|5.0|This was purchased for my daughter.  She said it was a good movie and I know she'll enjoy having in her personal film library
0891419063|5.0|If you have never been in combat this book will give you the best view you can have from s secondary posistion
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Quality in script, casting and production value places this series above most. Timeless issues addressed by Shakespeare exist here.  The family members(upstairs and down) have flaws, however problems are addressed openly and solutions found with resonance for our own times in elegant storytelling tradition.
1452115567|5.0|Who doesn't love pictures of dogs in unusual situations?  I bought this book for my husband as a Christmas gift; but I think we are both going to enjoy it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Just what I needed to satisfy my Spidy cravings. It's simple, and it works without any fuss. What more could you ask?
0061730327|5.0|My husband has worked for the power company for many years.  This was recommended to me by a co-worker whose husband loved the book.  I bought it as a Christmas present for my husband; something he would not suspect; as a surprise.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book gets it's fame riding on the coat tails of the Hunger Games.  Obviously, it's a great story.  And a great stolen idea will almost always distract readers from the huge lack of talent from the writer.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|The music they make is beyond amazing. The fact that it's only voices on every track makes each song that much more impressive. Impossible not to like this album.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen. I never saw it before, and it was a pleasant surprise. Made me cry and laugh.
B00DYFCYSO|4.0|I just started liking Johnny legend ...... Some of his music is too hip hop for me, but much of it is really good.<br /><br />P.s. Don't like that I have to write a minimum numbers of words here to review my purchases..... It's annoying and not necessary ......sorry.<br /><br />Bothered enough to have to let someone know!!
B00G32TD98|4.0|The acting and story were very good.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is the fact that I wasn't scared after the movie was over.  The sign of a great horror flick is when I want to turn on all the lights and can't sleep afterwards.  Not so here, but still one of the better horror films I've seen in awhile.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was looking for a game all day and I was getting mad!!then I saw this game!!!!I played all day on this game and my brother loves this game to!Almost all of my family and friends have this amazing game!!!!!!!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This novel is truly one of a kind, at least from the thousands of books that I have read.  I was so excited to read a book that FINALLY had a different tone of voice and point of view.  As made very clear from the thousands of other reviews, this book is about a father who is the ADA in a small town where his 14 year old son is accused of murdering a classmate.  I found this book to be a great page-turner and I couldn't put it down!  I recommended it already to a bunch of friends and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a murder mystery type of novel.  I must say this is now one of my favorite books!<br /><br />I read a few of the one-star comments and noticed that people said the characters needed more development.  I totally disagree.  This book is not about the characters personalities and I don't think we needed more information about the father to enjoy the novel.  It focuses on the accusation of the son and I think there is enough character development to carry the plot along.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|This movies was my husband.  I wasn't  a fan, but he loved it.  The price was great,  The quality was good. :)  :)
B0049J2CKE|5.0|Charming, well-written film.  Great family viewing.  My kids watched it over and over again.  They're still quoting from it, and laughing out loud.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very fun game. My 11 year old son discovered that I had put it onto his Kindle overnight and he could not put it down except to eat and go to the bathroom for the whole weekend.
B009NX1YT6|1.0|This used to be a favorite but now that I see the movie through Christian eyes and mind, I won't watch it again.
B005LAII08|5.0|One of the best movies!  The Blu-Ray makes everything so much better and the 3-D effects are amazing!  Loved this movie.  It arrived on time and in great condition.
1601251556|5.0|It great flip mat that holds up well works with wet erase or dry, was just what I needed after some accidents ruined hand drawn maps.
B008Y6YIXM|5.0|This is, in my humble opinion, the greatest movie of all time. I can watch this movie at any point or at any time.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app is a great app it gives me all I need I find it back fascinating and I would defiantly recommend this to every one
B0041D843M|5.0|The China Study is the best book I've ever read. It was recommended to me by my doctor. This book literally changed my life.
B00AHQNHSY|2.0|Makes you use the Google Play Store when you have to upgrade after download, no option to download the upgrade in Amazon's App Store. Does not play simple video tracks at all, you get a black screen and nothing happens. Would suggest you look at something like MX Player which has no issues playing movies on even the simplest of Android tablets.
0385537131|5.0|Loved this book...first book in a long time that really kept my attention.  Great writing...great characters and unexpected plot twists make it worth your time.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This was the best PBS series ever!! The quality of the dvd's was a perfect way to share this story with friends.<br />I'm so glad I own this, as I will be watching it again soon, in preparation for the next season.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great vacation read. I really enjoyed it send the characters were very intriguing.  Would recommend to a friend. Very enjoyable.
B007GYREYI|5.0|IT works great but I did not realize it was only vol 1 so now I have to but vol 2.  I need to read the fine print better.  very satisfied.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I really want to try this game, but it doesn't seem to work properly on my HTC one.  Please help
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Could not put it down.  Totally immersed in the characters and story.  Funny, sad, compelling, heartbreaking, heartwarming. Gives different perspective on controversial issue.  Ready to read again.
0736092269|5.0|I received the book on time. It did not took long to reach me. When I opened it I saw every steps had been shown carefully where the workout effects our muscles to grow. I like the book.<br /><br />Its useful.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|High quality and Denzel is his usual great but i personally don't like sad and depressing stories, that's what the cable news channels are for.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I enjoyed it,  it kept me interested.  I had a lot of fun looking for the object and placing them where they belonged
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|Enjoyed the amazing characters, well crafted notes and overall colorfulness of this book.  Nicely done, would love to see more from other places...
B00AE4OGCU|4.0|Starts off a bit slow but once the story gets started it is excellent. Only a few places where it begins to slow down again.<br />Great Read. Addictive!
B00297FEUS|4.0|One of the greatest albums in the history of rock. Period.<br /><br />Now, about THIS EDITION (25th anniversary deluxe 2-CD set) :<br /><br />Finally, a CD version that actually sounds good. Previous CD versions sounded \\"clean\\", but lifeless. This one sounds a lot like the original LP.<br /><br />YET...<br />The original LP had the lyrics.  Why doesn't any CD re-issue include them in the booklet??  This one has an extended booklet with the history behind the album and some nice pictures from the same sessions, all very welcome. But I half-expected the lyrics to be there too, since the original LP had them. And... nope, they're not there.<br /><br />Also, the two discs together hold a total of slightly over 70 minutes.  A single disc could hold up to 79 minutes with no problems.  Why two discs? And the original case doesn't even hold the discs very well.  A single disc would have been much more practical and it would fit perfectly.<br /><br />\\"Oh, but I only like to listen to one of them at a time\\". Well, press \\"stop\\" when you want to stop and press play on the track you want it to start. I play the whole thing and I like to put one disc there and just let it play. And I can't do it with this one.<br /><br />Still, it's the best version around.  The bonus disc is not bad. Not the best thing I've heard, not a real reason to get this, but not bad.  The real reason to buy this edition is:  it finally sounds good on CD. Although I still play my old LP from time to time.
B0013F1D02|4.0|I like the cast, the plot was so outrageous it kept my attention, and It was nice to see Robert Deniro in a different type of role.
B00DYEN5QU|2.0|What an absolute let down.  I read reviews for some time and figured that it's gotta be at least entertaining, but it turns out I was wrong.  I watched it in 3D and even that was disappointing.  The story was re-told in a way that would have embarrassed Christopher Reeve if he were still around.  Henry Cavill, although chiseled etc., had a constant dumbfounded look on his face like he just didn't understand why the chicken had to get to the other side.  Russell Crowe was the best part of this movie hands down and his presence throughout the film granted the second star in my rating.  Kristen/Amy Bell/Stewart/Adams or whatever it is, was absolutely useless for this role and a good actress that should stick to Oscar caliber films.  These guys going around re-making superhero films should get their act together and stop pretending that they're too cool for school by cutting up the story.  The experienced would have been so much more fulfilling if they would have followed the same timeline as the original and allowed the characters to develop without flashing all over and behaving stupidly.  I wish I could write more, but I would inevitably end up spoiling the film.  I wouldn't say &#34;don't watch it.&#34; I would just say &#34;don't spend any money to see it.&#34;

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is entertaining, as I find myself going back to play more often than I'd like to admit. A nice easy way to pass
076535618X|5.0|I stopped here because the story seemed finished to me although there is the last book … Though I enjoyed the books.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great book to read. I enjoyed the story and loved the twists in it. Read it for a book club.
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|Glad I got it on discount, some good tracks some alright tracks and some wak tracks but hey worth the money.
B00B769XB8|2.0|Audio in spanish and english. Subtitles in spanish and english.  For me the 3D effects are no real. The dont look real. Its a shame because the actors are good and credible and is have plenty of action.
B00FMFEA68|4.0|Unic , but it would be perfect with just a little less yada yada. But you will enjoy getting to know the Moz first hand.
B00BPA2PGG|2.0|No audio in spanish. Subtitles in english and spanish. Buy only if you have  a 4k tv and bluray 4k. Dont buy if you dont have it.  The version in regular bluray have audio in spanish.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|A little too addicting if you ask me - I love being able to play this game and just keep on going....Make sure you try all the modes to challenge yourself.
B00GDL5HNA|5.0|Lady A does it again with another fantastic album. While the sound is similar to other records, listeners can see them making a move towards other sounds with \\"Downtown\\" and \\"Compass.\\" There is not a \\"bad\\" song on this CD and I'm so glad that I made the purchase!
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|It starts out a bit slow then it pick up and runs from then on Don't know what the critics are going on about.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|Autism is becoming a well trod path in recent years, probably due to the success of &#34;Dog in the Nighttime&#34;. This novel takes a fresh look by examining relationships between seemingly &#34;normal&#34; people and those with autism, and asks the question how much intimacy are any of us capable of?  &#34;The Rosie Project&#34; is aptly titled because the tendency is to assume we know who the object of the project is.  I like thought provoking books.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|What can I say it is Star Trek. I was not sure how I felt about it when it first came out but I must say it is one busy movie. Grabs your attention and holds it
B005ZMTYTQ|3.0|The movie was a good start, but it focused more on the main characters relationship with Sarah, rather than the development of his legacies.  The movie hooked me, and I had to start reading the remaining books, which they themselves are a great story about the Lorien 9.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|This is not a movie I will watch alone or at night. It is very intense to watch. The audio id unreal.  Glad I didn't see it at the theater because I would have had night mares.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Excellent movie! I would highly recommend this to everyone.<br />This is the type of movie that you can watch over and over ad never get tired of watching it!<br />Action packed with humorous too!
B00004U8P9|5.0|This is an old classic that I happen to own in a bunch of different ways from VHS to DVD and now Blueray.  I love this movie and every one in it.
B001EC3JME|4.0|Perfect for my staff/security job. Fits my flashlight snuggly and it's easy to remove and replace. Has a rotating clip which is nice though it was really, really stiff to begin with.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Missed this one at the theater but on my big screen it still is fantastic.  I loved it all the way thru. There is one shock after another. Bout the time you figure it out it does another turn around.
B003274QH6|5.0|This is probably one of the best series on TV ever.  Bryan Cranston is a fabulous actor.  I missed the first season, so I wanted to see it all.  This did not let me down.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Wanted to see it on the big screen but missed it. On my big screen it was great. I think the movie started out slow the all hell breaks loose like all the other ones.
B000QCTNIW|4.0|A good read for those interested in brain science. Also gives a glimpse into the world of scientific research which sadly enough can be hindered by jealousy and competitive interests as much as it is advanced  by philanthropic drives.  Because the book has a practical side, also, I recommended to a friend who is struggling with leaving her house after taking a nasty fall.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Starts out fast and never stops. My kind of movie. Holds your attention all the way thru. Even the flash backs are full of action
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|The more I listen to it, the more I love it.  We've come to expect so much from her, give this album a listen or three, and you'll find yourself loving every song...
B001TH16DI|5.0|Beautiful package.  I have seen them all so many times but I still want to see them again. Only a couple are stinkers the rest are just great. I mean this is Star Trek.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I really got involved in this game and must, must get the rest of the game.  I love interactive ..hidden object games, and this one is awesome.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|This game lets u customize ur character. This game lets u upgrade  ur guns. But they only have 39 missions.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|They are all short stories depicting the horrific event that unfolded before them, when nothing made sense as to the pandemic phenomenon. Sure some stories were good, but overall I felt the context of it all was slow and boring.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Great series, excellent cast. Story is often funny or touching, with great visual effects. The bond between the cast members<br />is growing and they work so well together.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|this is really great device to watch.  I wish its could expand to watching other media instead of YOUTUBE and Hulu only.
B00CA4S27W|5.0|This is honestly the best Blackmore's Night offering to date! There is more of Ritchie's electric guitar to sink your teeth into, AND the mystery is back in the ballads. Candice Night's vocals are better than ever. Very VERY nice stuff! You will not be disappointed! Just wish BN would tour more in the US.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|I bought this CD as a gift for our daughter ... she loves to listen to music ... and LOVES the CD!!
B004LWZW9C|5.0|I love the mix  of stories, great mix of characters,  this is just a good movie to watch  ,  some of the same cast membesr as Valentines day  Love the older woman at the end.
B00D2JDNQ4|2.0|Despite the fact that the book is very well written and the characterisation is clear I found the book extremely dull. I read about 25% of the book and absolutely nothing happened; generally it put me to sleep often after only reading a page or two.<br />Whilst as I have said it is well written it is thoroughly overwritten. My wife found the same and she has also given up on the book after reading about 30 %. Very disappointing for a Booker.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is easily the best puzzle game here.  With all of the different levels along with just the mass of puzzle boards, this will last you quite a while. The only problem I would say is don't start right before bed, you be up til dawn.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is a good intelligent show.  I like the actors and all the twists and turns.  Nothing is ever black and white and this show proves it.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|It brings up a lot of questions but doesn't attempt to answer any of them.  The cover art seems misleading too.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this game is very very addictive. I can play this game all day. this has got to be one of the funnest game ever!you have got to get this game.it is awesome
0765325950|5.0|This book is great! It utilizes all of the lore the series created so well, only without all the needless verbosity. Every word in this book is essential to the ending of a great series. It is not like books 9 and 10, where you find yourself counting the pages until you get to a chapter that isn't about some boring ancillary character's regal clothing shifting back and forth in the world of dreams.<br /><br />If you have read even halfway through the series I recommend that you slog through the rest of Jordan's works until you get to where Sanderson takes over. From there it is all action and intrigue, without the braid tugging and other &#34;ugh I don't understand women!&#34; and &#34;men are all wool headed sheep herders!&#34;.<br /><br />This series is great, and this whole book is full of the 'magic' that made the series such a good read in the beginning.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|This review is made by a 9 year old girl just saying. Anyways i Love Love Love x 1000000 this movie has so many good catchy songs sometimes when no one is around i catch myself singing the songs while I draw or something! I highly recomend this movie to bronies and anyone who likes My Little Pony!!! (sorry if i dont spell right like I said im only 9)
B009RH9FR6|3.0|This Marware case looks much like the one I purchased last year for my (non-HD) Gen 2 Kindle Fire. I was surprised to find that the simple, sturdy, all-business design I anticipated, was trumped by the addition of the portrait/landscape rotation feature. The idea is good but this model is not ready for prime-time. Extra padding and the rotatable fixture (which requires considerable effort to turn) stacks up to perhaps double the thickness of other Fire HD cases. The leather hinge is wide to accommodate the added thickness, giving the cover a floppy feel and allowing it to not always close squarely. The generous leather hand-strap inside is not recessed sufficiently and prevents the cover from closing cleanly. The resulting light-leakage handily defeats the Kindle's auto-on/off feature.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Haven&#34;t played it that much so am still learning but dislike that went you &#34;earn&#34; bonus things when you go to use then it cost $.99 .
B005IZLPME|5.0|The disks and packaging were in great shape and the product was shipped safely.  It is exactly what I ordered and I really enjoy the movie.  It is another exciting chapter in the Marvel comics repertoire and isn't my favorite, but it is still very entertaining.  It is also a good one to watch in 3D.
B00FAIPDAE|4.0|It's like clash of clans. It keeps me busy for a little but needs more to do. Fun game over all.
B001NFT3Z4|5.0|Cannot go wrong with tremors old movie but still can watch it over and over again its funny, freaky, just plain awesome
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder was so suspenseful in many ways you always want to know what's going to happen next . I think this book is perfect for readers who like kids who have no self confidence in themselves<br />and friends and courage help him get over his no self confidence
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a great series. I am sad for it to end but can not wait to see the next movie. What a passionate story about love and hate.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I really like this app, very easy to use, has lots of features and never fails to wake me up
B00EO10M54|5.0|great cd  with some great songs and graphics art work every thing about the cd is awesome nice beat music
B000B7HZXM|5.0|I love Rod Stewart and his music. The old and the new!  Now that I'm older I enjoy easy listening music when I'm crafting or cleaning house and I have this collection to keep me loving Rod Stewart !!!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Gaga absolutely kills it with this album. Great sound and fantastic lyrics. It's really good to hear her music again.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|My family loved Les Miserables the musical, so we went to see this on opening night. I bawled like a baby (knew I would!) and was passing the tissues down our row. Really outstanding film.<br /><br />My only disappointment was Russell Crowe; and it's not that he was *bad*, it's just that the rest of the cast was so incredible he kind of got out-leagued.
