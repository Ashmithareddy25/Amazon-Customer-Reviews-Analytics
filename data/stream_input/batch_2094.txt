B0036EH3UC|5.0|I loved the series, every character was uniquie in their own persona. I was on the edge of my seat thru all the episodes. At one point I really felt so sorry for those poor cylon's. You get so caught up in the storyline and its really emotional. This series was very well written. I was just wishing they would have showed us some bloopers that the actors made during the filming that would have made the package so much greater. Watching these episodes I was in shock and couldnt believe some of the things happened when they did. A friend of mine sent to razor to watch and I loved it so I had to see the rest of the series. I never ever watched a single episode of BSG because like the characters in real life I was serving my country. I am so glad I bought the series because I will deffo be watching it all over again. Yep its that good. Take it from me there are so many twists and turns you weill be very surprised til the very end. You wont believe whats coming. Enjoy!!!!!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|We all know and love Harry Potter, there isn't much to say other than this is a great buy. Do yourself a favor and get it for you and your kids.
0307719774|5.0|I really love this book.  It’s designed for you to write a couple of lines only, which it supplies the necessary room for.  It is also what makes this book actually doable every day for the next five years.  If you’re looking for a daily journal this isn’t it.  It has many different kinds of questions too, ranging from more thought provoking to very simple.  It makes a point to ask things that will be fun to look back on in the years to come.  The binding is solid, which was a concern with a 5 year journal.  The gold edges are a nice touch, and overall I felt that I got exactly what I was looking for.
B00AQMSJI2|1.0|SinceI have to have a certain number of words to rate this product I will write this sentence and add what my son said....&#34;Boring&#34;
B007ZTLLMK|1.0|I can not download it because At&t blocks my access to Amazon Marketplace on my cell phone.  sorry about that.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|son did not enjoy game as he would have to wait for the game to advance in each level played.
0714843377|5.0|Had a small piercing through the center, probably why I got for so cheap. Doesn't impede on the readability in the slightest.
0988262592|5.0|So I read the preview of the Phoenix Project before it was released, and was hooked by the end of the first chapter, and when I received my copy I consumed it in record time. Bill's situation reminds me of a situation I was in with a previous company. I started with the company and my whole world was turned upside down in the first two weeks. Everything was an `IT problem', no one worked together and there was plenty of finger pointing. The company was on the edge, and I only found all of this out after I accepted the position and started work.<br /><br />Bill is thrust into a senior IT management position abruptly on a Tuesday Morning, finding out that everyone between his old position and the top levels of management is no longer with the company... and then all hell breaks loose. Bill quickly tries to triage as best he can, pulling from previous experience, but this is a whole new ballgame for him... and a nightmare for even the most experienced Managers.<br /><br />Bill finds some unlikely help in Erik, a `prospective' board member and, as we later find out, an awesome (yet frustratingly vague) mentor. Erik teaches Bill the Three Ways, a new and enlightened approach to IT thinking.<br />Bill finds his way through the mud by solving a number of Erik's vague references, each one bringing a new clarity to Bill and his team. Their eyes frequently opening to a new way of thinking, helping them to push IT out of the mess it was in. The Operations teams learn to manage their priorities, deal with their constraints, provision their time and resources properly amongst many other things.<br /><br />Bill's Story in the Phoenix Project grabs you from the first chapter, and you find yourself turning each page as fast as you can, the authors created a cast that hits close to home and you just have to see how it turns out. I would really recommend reading the book twice, the first time will entertain and teach, the second read will open your eyes. The second time you will readslower and start identifying more ways that The Three Ways can be applied in your organization. Make notes, toss it up on a white board and work it through, there is so much gold buried in these chapters that you will be amazed.<br /><br />Thanks to BMC Software and Gene Kim I own a Kindle Copy of the Book, but will also be adding a hardcover copy to my bookshelves now that the Amazon Snafu is over.<br /><br />I really feel that everyone from the Dev interns to the C levels should read this book.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|This was a very entertaining movie. I really enjoyed it. It kind of reminds me of the style of Despicable Me. Good for all ages.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I enjoy playing this game daily. Only down fall is when you build stuff most of the achievements ask you to build stuff you already have and doesn't give you credit for it.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because it was hard to get the game started...to find the request from my friend! I almost gave up!<br />This game will keep you chuckling if nothing else..especially if you are NOT artistic!! Fun!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really awesome game i love it right now i am trying to save two of the coolest hoverboards. I wish all games were this fun to play.
0525952926|5.0|Excellent book,I read fall of giants and i like it, this one is very good too. i am looking forward to the next one!
B007A4SDCG|4.0|A great read for anyone with creative callings, artistic aspirations or long-shelved projects indefinitely placed on \\"pause\\", this book will inspire you to action.<br /><br />Pressfield targets intangible but ever-present \\"Resistance\\" as the key element that threatens to cripple any creative endeavor at every stage of the process, most notably and fiercely near its completion. It's not a \\"magic pill\\" type book, not flawless, and you'll likely not agree on everything discussed; but you will find far more points that hit home than you discard, as if Steven were right there pointing his finger in your face. Not condescendingly, but more like a leaf blower aimed your direction blasting away the cobwebs of inertia.<br /><br />My biggest gripe (and inversely biggest compliment) is that it's too quick a read. I could not put it down and plowed through the Kindle version of this book, a few hours just before bed, finishing it before noon the next day. That it held my attention with such conviction is a testament to the author's honest and straightforward message. The chapters are brief, and some are just silly short. The near 200 pages is far, far less in word count than you'd think; but the points being driven home only required the few choice words. Luckily, this book is very re-readable and I'm sure will be referenced often in the future for a kick in the rear anytime the \\"Resistance\\" has me on the ropes.<br /><br />A must-read for anyone with a trapped creative voice or calling beckoning to be freed.
B0063GORYU|5.0|The Action is very smooth. I like the Tap feature which can really speed up play.  The game works better than my Mac version
B001K3JF7K|5.0|love quite nights, love how smooth her music is, very very true to her talent. you cant go wrong with anything Diana Krall puts out :)
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|Mr. Dawson is a passionate atheist who writes about his subject brilliantly, lightly where possible and with refined humor. Eminently readable even for one new to the subject, he builds his case against theism block by block convincingly. It was hard to put the book down. It was a pleasure
B005HSL626|5.0|Our family loves this game! I think of it as a stress buster.Warning it can easily become addictive! Hours of FUN!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I liked this book so much I read it, then re-read it, twice in one week. I highly recommend this book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Saw the movie and heard from a few friends how amazing the books were and they were right ! Amazing read! Didn't want it to end.
B009EEFTMC|2.0|Although the designs and colors are very pretty, I was bored with this game after the second time I played it.  Glad I only payed .99.
B0096CDG0O|2.0|This is only my personal preference.  I am not one to play games online with people that I don't know and I did not know that the 2 heads in a circle meant I had to have someone online to play with.  If you like to play online it would probably be wonderful.
6304779607|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE, REMINDS ME OF WHEN I WAS YOUNER WATCHING IT WITH MY DAD!!!GREAT SELLER, GREAT PRODUCT, AND GREAT MOVIE QUALITY!! BUY BUY BUY FROM THIS SELLER AND THIS PRODUCT
B00138KDO6|5.0|Great band great album, especially for working out or after a difficult day at the office.  Buy this album now!
B00962ZOOA|1.0|Please explain to me why this woman is still singing.  Her voice is too rough to be singing songs like these, especially ones from musical greats!  A cover album, like that hasn't been done before.  Why ruin perfectly good songs?  I'm sure she's very talented, but these are not the songs for her.  I definitely could not listen to the full tracks.  Her voice sets me on edge.  Maybe she was better in the Spice Girls.  At least then, her voice was blended with others who could actually carry a tune.  Better try next time, A.K.A. Sporty Spice.
B004GYY714|5.0|OMG i love this thing ! Have kindle Fire HD and the sound is amazing ! Tons of stations , great reception, easy to use...music anywhere ! also has local police and fire scanner, what fun. Highly recommend !

B004JZBGWI|4.0|Love this notepad for grocerie lists, to do lists, etc. Calendar does not show information on what you have going on that day, just shows a dot of color for something in a specific catagory until you open the day, otherwise I would have given 5 stars. But easy to use, easy to acess lists, very very useful. And free ! yay !

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game is the best thing ever made.<br />I don't think that anything can beat that and whoever made this game is a totally cool person that can't be beat.<br />THIS GAME IS AAAWWWWSSSSSSOME!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is very fun and addicting there needs to be more games like this one.sweet! I wish all games were this price. Thax a lot.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game way better than temple run.this game can never get old.no game can bet it.greatest game in the world
B009X2CVXA|4.0|I like  Kate's style of writing,  and  how  the  story  shifts  from  present  to  past.<br />Mystery  was set  up well  and  kept  me  interested.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Enjoyable watch with good acappella music but weak story line.  Predictable but fun. Made a 5 hour plane ride pass quickly.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A good book, looking forward to reading more from this author, good storyline keeps you reading.a must read if you enjoy this type of story.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game was pretty fun. Went to play it just a bit ago and all data was erased for absolutely no reason.Not wasting time getting back to where I was for this app to randomly erase your effort.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Well researched, empirical evidence based analysis of why our economy is moribund.  Thirty plus years of conservative, free market unrestricted political leadership (sic), has left the middle class in shambles and produced the United States of Advantage, and everyone else stay behind.<br /><br />What is amazing, is there are still adherents to this disaster, who are in the middle class, but buy the propaganda, even amidst the ruins of what once was the American Dream!
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I had high hopes for this book. All were dashed within the first chapter.  The format of the book includes pages from various novels that the protagonist is reading.  That's not easy to try to explain either! :)  The protagonist loves to read, so the author includes page after page of those other stories... right in this midst of his 'mystery', which isn't a mystery at all. The primary character is not likeable and the aforementioned format is so disruptive that this book easier to put DOWN than to pick UP!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I Like this game a lot! Very entertaining with many levels. I would have liked more seek and find mini<br />games.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|The winding down story of the Western ways of the past.  Excellent acting performance by Lee Marvin and Jack Palance as they slowly realize that time to work as cowboys is no longer an option.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 6 year old downloaded this, and it's fun enough for both of us to play :) Simple and cute.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|A light hearted easy read of love and its troubles...A bit predictable but still enjoyable...A good beach or rainy day read.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|This book did not disappoint. I would recommend this series. I hope the ending is all it is building up to be. On to book three!!!
0446573027|4.0|Having read The Forgotten, which was Puller novel #2, I decided to read book one, and I'm very glad that I did.<br /><br />In book 2 we heard frequent references to Puller's recent adventure in West Virginia, and I was pleased to learn that this book tells that particular story.<br /><br />There are a lot of unanswered questions about John Puller, ie, what happened to his mother; what did his brother do; etc, but there was no need for them to be answered in this book.  Maybe there will be a later book givine the backstory, maybe not.  In any case, it doesn't really matter.<br /><br />Others have compared Puller to Reacher, but I don't see the connection.<br /><br />As for the details about coal mining conditions in W Va, they made sense, even if a certain amount of artistic license was employed for effect.<br /><br />This was a well done mystery that keeps the reader guessing. My only complaint is Baldacci's consdtant switching from American style dialogue (he said; John said) to British style (said he;  said John).  The UK style grates on American ears, and switching back and forth is even more annoying. Make up your mind, David, are you going to appeal to US or UK audiences.
030758836X|4.0|This book is an exciting book with twists and turns abounding.  I loved it and found myself cheering for some of the characters.
B000QE1U9K|5.0|This is one of the less-than-extraordinary additions in the &#34;Alien&#34; franchise, but the DVD was fine and very affordably priced.
B009A3NGF4|4.0|I admit not as good as the first album but mumford & son's are one of my favorites still. There is plenty of good music on this album and I did not find one I did not like. Worth the purchase.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I enjoy lifestyle preview, and how it illustrate the weather. Also, how accurate it is.  I always look before walking my dog or jogging.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway surfers is amazing I have been playing it for quite a while now,<br /> it is really good how you can play with other people
B00ANW33CM|5.0|This 3D mahjong floats in space - you feel like you are playing something from the future.<br />Your timer has 30 seconds per move and will replenish once you finished a move.<br />You can still continue when out of time - as long as it doesn't happen too often, you should also still earn stars.<br />You do not need to finish one level to progress - choose any level you want directly from the menu.<br />You move around by panning and zoom by pinching - this is completely intuitive.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Ethan Wate used to think of Gatlin, the small Southern town he had always called home, as a place where nothing ever changed. Then he met mysterious newcomer Lena Duchannes, who revealed a secret world that had been hidden in plain sight all along. A Gatlin that harbored ancient secrets beneath its moss-covered oaks and cracked sidewalks. A Gatlin where a curse has marked Lena's family of powerful Supernaturals for generations. A Gatlin where impossible, magical, life-altering events happen.<br /><br />Sometimes life-ending.<br /><br />Together they can face anything Gatlin throws at them, but after suffering a tragic loss, Lena starts to pull away, keeping secrets that test their relationship. And now that Ethan's eyes have been opened to the darker side of Gatlin, there's no going back. Haunted by strange visions only he can see, Ethan is pulled deeper into his town's tangled history and finds himself caught up in the dangerous network of underground passageways endlessly crisscrossing the South, where nothing is as it seems.<br /><br />This book transported me right into a crazy world and I loved it. What a ride. This book was amazing. It was nice to see more supernatural characters, but it did a little confusing at times. I did have to re-read parts. I loved seeing Ridley again. Link was a much better character in the book. It was very interesting to see their dilemma flip flopped. Macon & Lila Jane's story was like getting hit by a Mac truck, because I didn't see that coming at all. I felt bad for Lena & Ethan. Lena because of the guilt and the pressure that was on her shoulders. Ethan because he had no way of knowing what happened at the crypt in the 1st book and the pain he felt with Lena pulling away. Getting to find out what Ethan truly was made my day. The only reason that this book didn't get 5 stars was that I felt the ending wasn't great. I knew it was going to be a cliffhanger but I think one is more than enough. This is a series you shouldn't miss!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|This movie is a delight especially for older couples. Excellent cast & lovely script. Anyone who enjoys British actors will love this movie.  Also highly informative about modern India.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling is a very talented violinist. This is the perfect album fot anyone who appreciates this style of music.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|This game is a challenge in a different way. You need to move your object through a course and pick up cubes along the way to the exit. Along the way, you also face obstacles and other surprises that you will need to overcome or use to your advantage to get to the exit. It really is a fun game! Try it, I think you will like it too.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use with none of the weird bullcrap of other apps. Thanks for an app that is just what it says it is.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|love this game makes you use your brain. even my five year old grandson loves it.i will add this too my most used games played.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a great book.  Without spoiling it, great twist and this would be great for a movie.  Colleen is a great author and look forward to more of her books like this.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie!!  Awesome plot and mind-bending enough to keep you on your toes.  Love Joseph Gordon-Levitt!
B00008J2PG|5.0|The ending is a double whammie!  True story that will give you goose bumps at the end!  I have loaned this out many times!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Wonderful true story, photography is breathtaking.  Very interesting how England abolished slave trading, not what you were expecting.  Shows the difference between politicians and statesmen!  Wonderful movie, I have loaned this out to numerous friends.
B000TEUSJU|4.0|True story, but somewhat on the gross side.  Watched once and sold back to Amazon.  Rent it, don't buy it!
B0011Z10PC|5.0|Probly the best album they ever released!  Music to enjoy and lyrics that tell stories and points of view.  Very entertaining
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I have loved the Lion King ever since I was a little girl and saw it in theaters for the first time. I am now 21 years old and still in love with this movie and will always be my all time favorite disney movie! I was so excited to buy it on Blu-Ray and it doesn't disappoint. The picture is beautiful and the sound is amazing, which makes me love the movie even more. One of my best blu-ray purchases yet!
B008BM9L72|5.0|I was a bit hesitant to read this as there was so much hype and discussion about the content. But once I started reading it I could not put it down. It was worth all the hype and not as raunchy as I expected. Great Read.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Loved it! Great story line. Page turner. I could not put it down. They way it was written was great. Felt like you were amoungst the games yourself.
0547884591|1.0|I liked the authors other books and pre-ordered this well in advance, as he said right from the beginning of the pre-launch that it was a book about learning. The hype on his blog centralised around this fact.<br /><br />After reading the first chapter that covered the basics of meta learning, he proceeded to then ignore it for the rest of the book, giving random recipes wild stories instead.<br /><br />What really got to me though, was that the only part of the book that I bought the book for was later released for free by the author. Ugh. What did I pay the pre-launch price plus international shipping for?<br /><br />I feel kinda ripped off and very much annoyed that I was \\"got\\" by a master at marketing. I will continue to follow the authors work but ill be reluctant to buy further content.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book more than any other book i've read... it's such an exquisite gift. I highly recommend to anyone! You need not be a dog or animal lover to fall for this book.
B001RNO7CG|5.0|This is a high quality shoe with a leather upper, wide toe box and great vibram sole.  I use these shoes for everyday as well as light duty hiking.  Long lasting and a great bargain at the price.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|This movie was excellent and they don't cut all the swears like on tv great buy for such a cheap price
B0079XPUOW|3.0|Star Trek fans will love the first few opening chapters, but the remainder of the book is substantially less interesting as the author goes &#34;meta.&#34;
0805092455|5.0|They read this in preschool, so she has it nearly memorized.<br />At 2 1/2, she pretends to be the teacher and reads it to us!<br />Everyone should get this book, and Brown Bear, Brown Bear!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter has been playing this game for a while and she has been having coin troubles. But do not worry about coins you guys. It is a fun game for all ages, and very 5 star worthy, and best of all, free! Me and my daughter love playing the game and she loves taking her tablet everywhere, and playing it all the time. And she is always unlocking New things like characters and hoverboards. My daughter gave her own review and it never showed so I'm making a review for her. Right now she is playing and trying to unlock Carmen in the Rio World Tour Subway Surfers. So this game is very good and it is fun too.
B001F8W400|4.0|I love cars and racing. I'm a huge fan of IMSA racing especially.<br />There's never really been a good racing movie till this one IMO.<br />Yeah, I know it's a little out there when it comes to the physics and all, but still, the mach 6 and the racing tracks in this unique movie were amazing.<br />I can only hope that there will be another Speed Racer movie done by the same director or someone even better.<br />I come back and watch this movie again and again whenever I can't find anything else worth watching. Must have watched it 2 dozen times and still love it.<br />Great movie. Wish more movie makers had this kind of vision and tech know how.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I've been a fan of John Mayer since the early days.  What I most like about his music was the incredible mixture of unusual acoustic chord progressions and a soulful voice (a la Seal).  The music became bluesier  which I also liked,  due to the organic sound of the blues itself.  But then I just think the sound got to big,  and so did John's ego.  It's great to hear an evolved, mature and honest sound.  Without pretentions like in the beginning.
B000669GAI|4.0|As all greatest hits compilation attempts,  some great songs are always missing.  This is not a sever case like U2 1990-2000 which lacks of hits like The Fly, Lemon, Please and Who's gonna ride your wild horses,  but it lacks Faithful which is on of my all time favorite songs.  Besides that,  it's a great compilation.
B0048KXRR6|4.0|My granddaugher and I really liked the first Nanny McPhee movie.  We have watched it several times.  Nanny McPhee returns is good but doesn't compare to the first one but We enjoyed it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|5 strs for great show fine acting cast is super story line excellent waiting for next year hope iy is as good
1416972250|3.0|While I liked this book, I didn't like it as much as the other ones in the series that I've read. It doesn't mean I won't read anymore of the series, I fully intend to read more books in the series, I just didn't care of this one as much. Maybe it's because I had the \\"big\\" reveals in this book figured out well before they where officially reviewed (I don't want to spoil them for you). I still enjoyed the ride getting there. It's possible you might not realize the \\"big\\" reveals way before they happened like me. I am the type of person that almost always figures out the twist in movies, etc... way before it happens.
B003HKN52U|4.0|just got the move for some one else to see but it was good one it is a love affair between three male vampire was a good movie thigh
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|good stuff fun and consuming lot of enjoyable time. just keep playing for a lot of strategy and rpg fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Absolutely amazing! I am so addicted to this game, and I cant seem to stop playing it! I have played it on multiple phones though and it always seems to lag, which isn't very convient.. but if you have a tablet... kindle fire... ipad... its works great:)
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I read all three books because the book club I'm in read them.  The story was good but it could have been condensed into one book.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The story line is similar to other books written by others.  As a matter of fact there was a movie with Julia Roberts with the same theme.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book it is very intriguing I can't wait to read the other books !!!!<br />I love it
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game has always been a favorite. Once I start playing I find it very hard to put my Kindle down.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|It is quite a challenge to get the piggies where they need to go. Some things that look obvious, aren't.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so so so so cool my cousin has lots of coins then his friends and me but I think that I have more coins than his friends
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|I had only read Truman Capote's In Cold Blood and not any of his earlier work.  His writing is truly beautiful, every word is a delight . . .now I understand his popularity and fame.
0399226907|5.0|This is a great litle book for 3 and 4 year olds. One can be sure with Eric Carle's books.
B008FYZIVY|3.0|This rating of 3 stars is referring to how the discs are labeled.  It is impossible to tell which episodes are on which discs.
B0074JODP8|4.0|Joe Bonamassa does it again with another great performance. Good video, good sound and stage camera work. I'd recommend this.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|We all need encouragement and need to remind our selves that there is nothing new under the sun. We just reinterpret and input a bit of ourselves. I have recommended this to many.
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|I really like this film. The story, if you can call it that, is basically just there to develop the characters, - which it does well.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|Great writing!<br /><br />We have already watched it three times.<br /><br />There is SO much to take in!<br /><br />It's a blast!  Fun
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|The film itself is excellent - very unusual with no violence (that's unusual in itself these days). The extra sections are fascinating.
B00004W4UB|3.0|I'm with the critics on this one. But I loved the settings, photography, and mood and so that balances out lacklustre dialogue, direction, and acting. It is worth sticking it out to see Malkovich's sinister face and the scenes that involve the kitchen staff and the wonderful grimy street scenes.<br /><br />Other than that, for me at least, the story dragged somewhat tediously. Julia Roberts hardly acted, whereas she might have and that would have only improved the film. Her inner conflicts did leave room for some character development that just seemed missing. Malkovich also seemed largely to be just reciting his lines most of the time. The creepy music was a bit boring to the point of being slightly distracting. Yet the overall mood was well-done creepy all things considered.<br /><br />Sorry fans, I just did not see it as you did. \\"Julia's most powerful performance\\" it says on the case. I simply can't see it that way.

8866137634|4.0|Moleskine notebooks are known for their construction and the quality of the paper used within them. These Evernote Smart Notebooks are no different in that regard. I use Moleskines daily for note-taking, journaling, and sketching. Love them.<br /><br />Evernote is an excellent (free) application for web, desktop, and portable devices that allows you to create digital notebooks and sync them so you have them anywhere. I happen to be a pretty heavy user of the various incarnations of Evernote and love it, too!<br /><br />So it seems to be a natural fit to have Evernote Moleskines. So, what are you getting and how do they fit in with your standard workflow?<br /><br />I could be wrong, but I think the idea is to bridge physical notebook users into the digital realm. Many people love to take notes on paper. With mixed text and sketching, it's really difficult to duplicate the efficiency of taking notes on a laptop or portable device. There are times when you're mainly typing, and that is highly efficient, but there's just something about writing it down that is satisfying. But then you have a digital world, as well. How to get those notes into Evernote for safekeeping, tagging, and later retrieval?  In this case, you simply take your note(s) and using Evernote's built-in page camera feature, snap a shot of the page. It then gets imported into Evernote and is synced across your devices.<br /><br />What is different about these notebooks compared to a standard large hardback Moleskine squared notebook?<br />1. The cover is beautifully embossed with the Evernote logo and icons from the splash screen.<br />2. The elastic closure is green instead of black.<br />3. The squared grid is dotted instead of solid lines.<br />4. Included are 4 pages of stickers for marking up your notes. These can be used to help with tagging your notes.<br /><br />It should be noted that you can use regular Moleskine notebooks in exactly the same way with the Evernote page camera to capture notes. So, while I think the green elastic and embossed cover make it worth it for me, you'll have to decide that on your own.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars if the dots used were lighter. The overall appearance of the grid carries the same weight as those of a standard moleskin squared notebook. However, because these are dotted lines instead of solid, it seems the dots are darker. Actually, there was some variation in dot darkness on some of the pages (maybe 20% are just a touch lighter). It's not distracting at all. I just would prefer them a bit lighter (or even to have a dot-square where only the corners are dotted like Leuchtturm).So, while I think the green elastic and embossed cover make it worth it for me, you'll have to decide that on your own.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars if the dots used were lighter.

B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|Once upon a time, Ben Affleck managed to alienate a lot of movie goers. That's too bad, because it turns out he's a good actor and a wonderful movie maker!<br /><br />This movie opens with scenes from an era I well remember, when the US Embassy in Iran was taken over and many Americans were held hostage for over a year. It was a sickening time, for many reasons. This early story is told with excellent couplings of footage from the era with the images from the new movie.<br /><br />At the time the Embassy was taken, six Americans managed to escape, unnoticed. They found shelter in the home of the Canadian Ambassador, where they stayed, hidden, for a year. This movie tells the story of how they were rescued. It is a thrilling story and all the more so because it is all true - every wacky silliness along with every harrowing fear.<br /><br />I don't usually watch &#34;extra features&#34; but I did in this case and it was well worth it.<br /><br />I say: Definitely see this film. It's a good one.

B0099Y2YL6|3.0|I love this show like everyone else which is why I couldn't wait to get Season 3 on DVD. However, I only gave it 3 stars because I just discovered that there are scenes that are cut!! I was looking for a particular scene and it wasn't there. I checked what is airing On Demand and I was right. They are cutting scenes on the DVDs!! I will not buy any more until they produce an uncut version. Very disappointed as I thought I would be getting more than what is showing on TV, not less!!
B004LWZVZC|5.0|A little known story of the trial of Mary Surratt for being a conspirator to the assassination of President Lincoln.  The historical event is played by a fine cast.  Robert Redford directs.
B005K17RU0|4.0|It's a good app...except in the video section the &quot;Unable to play video&quot; message partially obstructs the video that is playing on my Kindle Fire HD.  In other words, the video plays just fine, but the irrelevant message blocks part of the picture.  Get rid of the unnecessary message.

B00006J3T4|4.0|I'll admit that I am a huge Mark Knopfler fan who has most of his albums, but I'm being objective in my review.  I won't argue with folks who think that this album is too mellow.  This is not an album where Knopfler \\"rocks out,\\" so if you are looking for Dire Straits sound-alikes, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />This album leans more towards stripped down, acoustic blues stylings, with Mark playing less electric and more acoustic.  It is also void of the celtic sounds that have now become standard on his records (ie Kill to Get Crimson, Get Lucky, and Privateering).  Compared to other records, I felt that his playing, though still stellar, was much more understated here.  You get to hear more acoustic fingerpicking style of play instead of the usual Strat/electric play, though the album is not without electric guitar.  That being said, it is his songwriting that once again shines.  I'll mention a few of the songs that struck me on this album.<br /><br />Why Aye Man--this could have been a Dire Straits song--it falls into Knopfler's continued focus on mercenaries who go to other lands either to plunder or to look to make a better living...and he tosses in some German in his lyrics!<br /><br />Devil Baby--great lyrics painting a picture of a sideshow and its characters--you can see Knopfler with a slight grin as he sings this song<br /><br />Quality Shoe--Mark plays shoe salesman (\\"You got your toecaps reinforced with steel/hard-wearing sole and heel/make those tired feet feel like new\\")--all to the beat of a 30s jazz standard.  If you are familiar with Leon Redbone's music, this sounds just like him.  He should cover this song.  It also sounds like it could have been plucked from Clapton Unplugged (ie San Francisco Bay Blues). Next time you go buy a pair of shoes, you'll hear this song in your head if the salesperson tries to help you out.  My second favorite song on the album.<br /><br />The Ragpicker's Dream--possibly the best lyrics of any song on the album--wonderful imagery<br /><br />Daddy's Gone to Knoxville--Mark goes Texas Swing with pedal steel guitar, fiddle and all the trimmings.  This song is a carbon copy of the Texas Swing songs that regularly appear on Lyle Lovett's records, if you are a fan of his.  My favorite song on the album.<br /><br />The remaining songs stay within the acoustic blues and rock genres without getting too loud.<br /><br />I give it four stars because I like some other Knopfler albums better, but this album definitely has its gems.  I'm glad that he ultimately veered into celtic music because I enjoy that style and it really adds alot to his songs, but that was yet to come when this album came out.  Overall, however, this is still a solid effort even though it probably won't make your top ten.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome!!! I love how when it is not a holiday you go on around the world tours with different themes every month! There are specials different characters on every place you go to. Whoever created this game is a genius. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! ♥
B00APJLFEG|5.0|It was a great movie. It was very funny and amusing. Lots of comedy and fun. I would recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I enjoy this game, My grandsons got me into it, they love it also.. downloaded it on my kindl fire.<br />My grandsons have it on there moms ipad....
B004NELBPC|4.0|I got this because I enjoy reading the Huffington Post. The app works great and the interface is simple to use.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the series. The acting is absolutely fabulous.  Costumes are outstanding. Julian Fellowes mastering of the English language is remarkable. The series are very respectful of the period.. As far as the original UK version is concerned, I truly do not see any difference with the USA version.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down, very good book. Ready for the third installment of the very scintillating crossover series. Very similar to 50 shades still a good read regardless.
B003UESJHY|5.0|It is hard to imagine that the Calvin Klein underwear boy, Marky Mark, has grown into the actor we see in The Fighter. He portrays Micky Ward to perfection. You will be in his corner from start to finish.<br /><br />Christian Bale established himself with his amazing and creepy performance in American Psycho. It is like he can wear his character as an outer skin. He makes it work again in The Fighter.<br /><br />The only comparable boxing film that comes to mind is Raging Bull.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's so fun. A very good and addictive game. Fun to play anywhere at anytime. Just completely amazing and kind of relaxing. Loved it.
B004529NKM|3.0|This is the least successful of the four Step Up dance films so far. The choreography is good but the magic is missing.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|very easy to use. large easy to read keypad. love this ap.<br />perfect for kindle. so glad I found Calculator Plus Free!<br />even the grandkids can use it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I've now had this bag for over a year.  I really wasn't expecting much at all when I purchased this pack.  I just needed a camera bag and this was the cheapest.<br /><br />First off, I haven't had a zipper break on me yet.  That's awesome.  For $30 I thought this would last me a few months and be quickly replaced.  But the build quality is awesome.<br /><br />It's also extremely spacious.  I can usually fit my full kit in it.  Right now I have two GH2 bodies, EVF, JuicedLink Preamp, shotgun mic, lav mic, XLR cable, four lenses, Gaf Tape, batteries, cables, nd filters, and cleaning supplies.  Plus you have velcro inserts that can be adjusted to your kit.<br /><br />Also like the double buckle.  I look like a geek but it keeps the weight evenly distributed.<br /><br />Very happy with the bag.  No need at all to get anything more expensive.  Highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|OMG I love this game  sooooo much an  it really is just like owning a real horse - after having to stop riding horses, I was pretty devastated because it was my favourite hobby but this game really cheers me up about it and I think  I may not have a horse now but I know I'll get one soon enough
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I realy like this app its fun....... But make sure you rate it after to get more coins.... I think everyone should buy this amazing app
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I highly recommend this book, period. Almost anything I try to say beyond praising this book highly might be a spoiler.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What can I say?  I came to this series very late in the game.  I watched all three seasons in the space of 10 days!  I took advantage of getting the remaining episodes of Season 3 on January 29 and watched about 6 hours of them within 24 hours!  I just have to be careful not to tell any friends what has happened because they are watching them on PBS and it won't be finished until 17 February 203!
B009ZQP42E|5.0|The movie is very funny and entertaining.  The fist time download was just a little confusing but after the fist it was very easy.  The movie in a favored and touches many of the social problems that we are facing now.  Could not recommend it more.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|This CD is one of the best I own.  Every track is beautiful and powerful.  I highly recommend it to anyone!
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|A decent move, but I found that it was a little off...not just from the book, but just a little off from being a great movie.<br /><br />If you haven't read the book and you are torn between the book and the movie, run to the book....do it.  Then, once you have read the book, you can watch the movie.<br /><br />Overall, I would give the movie a 70/100.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I always loved Daria through elementary school...you know, back when MTV actually cared. I am disappointed that the original soundtrack is not on the DVDs, but it's still Daria. 100% happy.
0307454568|4.0|I've come to consider Stieg Larsson's trilogy of novels to be similar to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.  And, in this comparison, the Stieg Larsson books fit a similar pattern to the Batman movies.  The first efforts do a good job of introducing you to the main characters.  The second acts are the best and the third ones tie up a lot of loose ends.<br /><br />In this final book, Larsson is forced to tie up a ton of loose ends from the first two books.<br /><br />To keep myself from giving away too many spoilers, I will stay vague, but lets just say that at the beginning of this 3rd book, things are in very dire straights and you pick up right where the 2nd book leaves off.<br /><br />As goes with the entire series, Larsson does a really great job of characterization, building characters that you can wrap yourself around.  The other really good thing about the series is that you are given all the information you need to follow along with the story and to solve it yourself, so Larsson plays no tricks.<br /><br />My one problem with this book, compared to the other 2 is that since this is the final in the triology, you do end up feeling like things are tied up too nicely and you are also left with questions about some of the characters that took sudden exits for no apparent reason.<br /><br />As a whole, this is a nice ending to the series and if you have made it through the first two books, you will find yourself drawn to this book and for good reason.
B009LQKHIO|2.0|Too incongruous a story combined with terrible spelling and grammar - not worth the time it took to read it
B005IF7HNA|5.0|I recently saw an episode of Torchwood broadcast on BBC America.  It was the first time I had watched the tv show.  It was thrilling in so many ways...science fictiony, intelligent, moody, action-packed, sexy, imaginative, beautifully filmed, and totally enthralling!  I found a Blu-ray boxed set of the complete show here on Amazon and am loving being able to throw a disc in and get lost in Mr. Barrowman's eyes and grin and Gwen's home life whenever I want.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not one to pay for books-I had to read it after all the publicity-Lets just say I am currently on Book 3! Very sexually explicit -
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely positively loved this book. I stayed up all night to finish it and then started it again the next day. The story begins with a flash forward and I wasn't sure what to think from there, but as it progressed there were surprises and twists that I definitely wasn't expecting. Sky & Holder's immediate connection and their true love for each other is just beautiful.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Easy, quick read! Great story, and a surprise at the end!  I would recommend this book, and I have!  Can't wait to see the movie!
B00A77II0U|5.0|I love this kind of game and this one is worth the money. haven't played the extra stuff yet but so far have enjoyed it will prob. play agian just to find all the secret items. Only drawback is it seems alittle short compared to some of the other similar games
B000069HJN|4.0|Until it was remastered as a CD, I looked for this album in any form and couldn't find it.<br />Then one day I saw it out as a CD. Most of the songs are long and very involving. I love it and think it is Supertramp at their best. The recording quality is good as well.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I own an old version (vhs) and this new dvd version is much better !<br /><br />  Always fun to see this classic show !
B000002KAT|5.0|The other is Moondance.<br />These were the first two.<br />Note that Brown Eyed Girl isn't on either and never was issued on a standard full-length recording.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|What a stupid, stupid movie.  Pathetic.  Has characters smoking weed like it's meth or something, just ludicrous, and utter nonsense. Most pathetic movie I've seen in a long time. Drug-war propaganda?
B000WAEK0E|5.0|A lot of his early songs are among his most famous.<br />But this group of songs shows how consistent he is and how he has been able to sustain his jazzy/bluesy style at such a high level for decades.<br />I love the horn arrangements. He himself plays the sax, along with piano and guitar.<br />My favorite, which I hadn't heard before, is Could Ye be Healed or something like that.<br />Here Comes the Night from his Them days doesn't sound like him and is probably Cliff Richard as it says.<br />A great song.<br />Irish mysticism meets the Blues.

B000002KHF|5.0|The other is Astral Weeks and I guess those were his two first ones.<br />I used to see him at the Fillmore in the 60s when he was living in Marin County.<br />Bill Graham must have liked him a lot because he had second billing most of the time in the shadow of Big Brother, the Grateful Dead and Airplane and many others.<br />Then he moved back to Ireland and I think people discovered him through his recordings more than through his performances, though he has been a prolific performer all over the world ever since.<br />One of the lyrical giants of Rock.

B001AGXEAG|5.0|Its a great movie, and in new shape. It got here very quick and I recommend this site to very one.
B0053O89XI|5.0|So, yeah, I think this is how shows should be released, assuming the cost is equivalent to existing releases.<br /><br />Blu-Ray + DVD + UltraViolet. And it looks like there are a fair number of \\"bonus features\\" on the set. So, yay for that! Always fun...<br /><br />You get Blu-ray for your hi-def TV/Blu-ray setup (if/when you get one), you get DVD for backward compatibility with older DVD players and you get permanent UV copy for your online digital streaming library and don't get nickel'd & dimed for yet another (digital) release of the same content.<br /><br />Makes sense to me. If movies & TV start getting released this way, either Blu+DVD+UV (preferred, if cost is equivalent) or Blu+ UV, I can tell I'll be buying a lot more. It just makes good economic sense. Kind of a 3-fer.<br /><br />I like this kind of release and hope more studios get on board with it. I'll probably slant my buying habits toward this kind of release over releases that are ONLY one or the other, or barebones releases, etc. So, make it happen. Of course, in a decade, everything will probably be all-digital. But, until then. The combo pack + UV approach seems like the best of all worlds.<br /><br />So far, it looks like only season 1, 2, & 5 of Big Bang Theory have been released this way, but not yet 3 & 4? *Sad panda.* Guess I'll hold off on season 3 & 4 until they get re-released under the new scheme. Make it happen, studio!
B00000K3D4|5.0|It got here really fast and was in great shape. I am very happy with this company and recommend them to everyone.
B0096HID5M|5.0|If you love musicals and 80s music then you will love this movie! Tom Cruise even sings! Its very good.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I gave the book a &#34;4&#34; rating because, at times, you are taken to a place and time that was not explained until the next or a later chapter. Sometimes the descriptions of a place or event was very long and drawn out. But, over-all the book was very interesting in a philosophical way. I loved and found his description of animals in the zoo as opposed to in the wild very interesting. His analogy between the two explanations of what happened to him that he gave the two Japanese interrogators and the separate religious beliefs pertaining to creation and the way to God at the very end was awesome.

B009AMAK54|5.0|Great movie.  Saw it in theaters and then had to get myself a copy to watch anytime i wanted to.
0345803493|4.0|Although highly predictable, the story was interesting enough to keep my attention.  Still debating on if I will buy the 3rd book.
B00683JK9K|5.0|This one is my favorite of all the puzzle apps. There's a nice selection (all landscapes) and I like the way it works. You have number of pieces options and organizational options, like doing the sides first which I always do. :)<br /><br />The pictures are pretty and it's fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love playing it but whens the update? Please add the update thats on iPod for kindle fire! &deg; o &deg;

B006LSZECO|5.0|You think you know how it's going to go, but you don't.  Wife goes missing, did he do it?  That was enough for me to start reading, but by the time I was done - I had read this amazing story with great characters that really stuck to my ribs.  Not to spoil the ending, but I think it's probably more real than other books and movies usually offer.  This is the kind of story that I try to retell to others to get them to read it, but I can't do it justice.  It's really good.  Read it!
B0073V7YTY|5.0|The Sound Meter application is great for checking ambient noises/sounds from the convenience of one's cellphone.  It is very intuitive and functional.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This entire series was absolutely amazing. Yes, there is TONS of sex. But if you skip those scenes...you would still have a great story. It's so sad. And happy. Each page is a different emotion (literally!)  I thank God that I read it over the summer, because I needed a week to recuperate after all the emotion I felt. And I'm not talking a tear here, a laugh there...I'm talking bawling my eyes out, give-me-the-strongest-alchohol-you-have-to-get-me-through-this type emotion. It is no doubt the BEST series I have ever read. The writing is a little iffy...repetitive, but the storyline is SO worth it. And if you are looking to spice up your relationship...this is for you.

0393088731|4.0|Longtime fan of Irvine's work here...I just finished Skagboys today and it was a harrowing ride.  I really feel like I know the characters like my own friends at this point after reading all three books in the series.  While I  I liked this one the least out of the trilogy, it was still a great read.  Irvine makes his characters pop out of the pages and you can tell he puts a lot of painstaking effort into researching his times/settings (I love the mid 80s England/Scotland he presents.  I was little disappointed that Begbie didn't get more airtime, but it's a minor complaint.  Hopefully this book, like the amazing sequel, gets made into a movie one day.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another of Grisham's suspenseful novels.  Confusion was made clear by the end of the book.  I would recommend it strongly.
B00A89ITZG|3.0|The drills are well presented and the key concepts are well explained. The book devotes a lot of space to injury prevention and treatment which will be appreciated by all athletes.<br /><br />Here's the rub: This book does not re-write the principles of adaptation required for peak sports performance but repackages it in a different framework, namely, crossfit.<br /><br />As all runners know there are certain key training runs: Long Run, Tempos, Intervals and Reps to name a few. These are repackaged as Run WODs. Similalry for the bike and swimming.<br /><br />And ask any endurance coach worth his/her salt and he or she will tell you that 2 days of strength training will go a long way to making you a better athlete and preventing injuries. This is repackaged into the CrossFit mould as well. Mobility and felxibility training is repackaged as CrossFit WODS.<br /><br />The truth is, and disagree with me if you will, but this is CrossFit's attempt to branch out into the rapidly growing market of athletic performance coaching in our gyms.
B000FA5SMK|2.0|I had read gold coast,which was wonderfully rich.  Plum island was not.  The protagonist, supporting characters, and the plot were never developed fully.  The climax was far fetched.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|The thing I love about Joe Abercrombie is that his characters:<br /> A. Act like adults<br /> B. Are not two-dimensional<br /><br />I love George R.R. Martin and Iain M. Banks for the same reason, but I think Mr. Abercrombie is the best of the lot.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|- - - as even more wonderful, kind, funny and poetic than you ever imagined.  He's, of course, already revered by Americans but this elucidates his character and times very well.  DKG is an excellent writer and it just flows along.<br /><br />However, it is long, long, long and the first part (where she talks more about the Rivals than about Lincoln) is a bit tedious though interesting.<br /><br />The reason I give it only 4 stars is because the copious illustrations are hopeless on the Kindle.  Better to read this as a normal book, not an e-book.
B00498YZH8|5.0|I have only ever seen trailers for this movie so I was kind of hesitant to buy it but once the movie was over I was glad I purchased it. Jennifer Lawrence did a phenomenal job playing Ree and what an amazing actress she is.  I recommend this movie but i do warn there is drug content and harsh language in this movie.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|This film is my all time favorite Pixar movie. Great story and great animation. All around awesome! I love it.

She loved it and with all the other Monster High items she has, it is a nice edition to her collection and believe me she PLAYS with them. It is so CUTE. I gave it 3 stars because the price is rediculous for the quality.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. However, it was lacking the Pixar feel. Just a typical story with a typical Disney ending. Nothing fantastic. I still did get all misty eyed at the end though, so.... :)
B006LSZECO|3.0|It is a quick read and holds your attention because you want to know what happens, but has a terrible ending.

B0094BB4TW|2.0|wish to play some games that tell me they require more adobe flash drive, and i have what they want?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing i cant stop playing it but the rio version isnt as good as i thourght it would be
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised to see that they could add to the mechanics of the first version and keep the game feeling fresh and new.  While I am horrible at running along ledges (&#34;it's me, not you&#34;) it works really well.  The new piece that really is a standout change is the introduction of the mining carts which uses the existing systems but is a ton of fun and works really wel visually.
B004XISI4A|5.0|Love the characters. It's great that you can follow the characters by chapters. Sometimes their story was so interesting I had to skip to the next chapter.
030758836X|4.0|I'd heard good things about \\"Gone Girl\\" but saw that many reviewers hated the ending, so I was nervous going into it.  Starting out, I was impressed by Flynn's decision to make both protagonists annoying, unlikeable brats, but not so awful that I wouldn't be interested in finding out what happens to them.  That's a fine line to draw.<br /><br />The plot is complex, and there are plenty of places where she could have slipped, and put in an inconsistent detail or plot twist that didn't work.  Though the plot is certainly hard to believe, the pieces fit together.  She doesn't step wrong.  There's only one place where something happened and I stopped reading to think, \\"Wait, if she didn't have the gate code she wouldn't be able to drive out alone.\\" (Don't worry, that's not much of a spoiler.)  To only run into that sort of thing once in such a twisty narrative is impressive.<br /><br />I don't understand why so many people hate the ending.  It's not a pleasant ending.  It's not the ending you WANT to happen.  But it's entirely consistent with the two flawed, not-self-aware characters' decisions up to that point.  It's a sinister ending, not really an ending at all, but a pause in the action.  You don't know what will happen after that, but it's not going to be good.  Again, this is entirely in keeping with the tone of the book.<br /><br />\\"Gone Girl\\" is good.  It's not one of the very best books ever written in the English language.  But it's a sharp, smart thriller that kept me turning the pages.  It's good enough that I'm recommending it to some friends but not everybody. If you need a book to read on a plane, if you're interested in true crime or mysteries, if you like dark-toned chick lit, you could do a lot worse than \\"Gone Girl.\\"
B00B2V66VS|4.0|good game. fun to play when your trying to kill time.<br />would've gave it five if it didn't clutch once in while.gets frustrating when I have a high score and the game glitches for a second.ahhhh!!!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Always a good read.......fast paced, plenty of action, and enough twists and turns to maintain interest. Fast, fun, and entertaining.

B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Cliche ridden film with barely any drama or tension. This film comes from the director who made &#34;Cast Away&#34; and &#34;Forest Gump&#34; but unlike the former this one is a clunker. Watch only as a research to see how Los Angeles rots your brain and forces even a talented director to think in banalities.

B00A81MV3U|5.0|This is why we go to movies. Silver Linings Playbook is that rare breed of movie where all the moving parts got put together in exactly the right way. The dialogue is sharp, witty, insightful, funny, and often brutally honest. It respects and holds true affection for its characters and the wonderful ensemble cast makes it look easy.  The direction, editing and soundtrack are spot on. It is a future classic and the best movie of the year.<br /><br />Pat is an underachieving substitute high school history teacher who has just been released from the Karel Psychiatric Facility after spending an eight month court-ordered stint for nearly beating the history teacher to death when he finds him in the shower with his wife. His doting, eternally optimistic mother brings him home hoping that the worst of his previously undiagnosed bipolar symptoms are under control. But his refusal to take his meds and an unfortunate incident concerning Earnest Hemingway and a window quickly dispels that optimism. Pat is in fact clueless, living inside a self-delusion bubble in which he reunites with the truly unattainable object of his obsession, his wife Nikki.  Two more mismatched souls the world has never seen but he is the only one who doesn't realize it. He plods doggedly on in pursuit, oblivious to everything and everyone else around him.  His illness has removed the normal barriers that prevent him from expressing the unfiltered truth as he sees it, making for some awkward, cringe-worthy, often humorous exchanges. Pat is hardly ready for the real world.<br /><br />And he certainly is not ready for Tiffany. Pat's best friend invites him over for a homecoming dinner which turns out to be a blind date with his wife's recently widowed sister, Tiffany.  Tiffany suffers from severe depression and her mood swings run the gamut - volatile, bitter, vulnerable, stubborn, sexy, and sweet - all thrown randomly into a mixer and blended at high speed. Everyone is a little afraid of her. Her depression results from her guilt over her husband's death which she attributes to her loss of sexual interest in him. She sleeps with everyone in her office in an attempt to anesthetize herself from her emotional pain. She is dead inside, just breathing air. And into this web steps the unsuspecting Pat.<br /><br />From the moment they meet sparks and barbs fly indiscriminately between them, much to the horror of their hosts who believe they are witnessing a train wreck in the making. But these two lost and damaged souls immediately connect, kindred spirits seeking respite from the storm. Pat is overwhelmed, unable to come to grips with guilt over the intensity of his attraction to Tiffany and the incident sends him into an uncontrolled manic episode. Tiffany feels the same connection and it jolts her far enough out of her stupor for her to see the possibilities. When Pat turns down her offer to sleep with her the flame sparks higher, her curiosity is piqued, and her pursuit begins in earnest.  As she starts to nurture and guide Pat, she develops such a flaming torch for him that it would blister the skin off any ordinary guy.  But he is oblivious, content just to follow her around like the lost puppy he is. She grabs the opportunity full throttle, dragging the perplexed, not-quite-ready-for-reality Pat along for the ride.<br /><br />The cast is simply brilliant. Bradley Cooper is a revelation as the bipolar misfit whose philosophy consists of working hard and staying positive to find the silver lining in everything. He and Jennifer Lawrence have such electrifying chemistry together that you find yourself rooting for them to find a way to be together from the moment they meet. Robert DeNiro comes alive in his Oscar-nominated role as Pat's Eagles-obsessed, superstitious, OCD bookie father. Chris Tucker deserves special mention as Pat's equally optimistic fellow psychiatric inmate and friend Danny (\\"Black it up Pat!\\").<br /><br />But make no doubt about it - this is JenniferLawrence's movie. At twenty two she is the real thing. Her performance here is transcendental. Even with the marvelous supporting cast holding the bar so high the movie would not work without her. She is visceral - caustic and vulnerable in the same breath. Her facial expressions hide nothing - she is fearless, willing to expose Tiffany's raw emotional core to everyone around her, warts and all as she juggles staying one step ahead of both Pats obsession as well as her own.  The transformational changes that occur are put into motion and propelled forward by her. She bets everything with no guarantee that he is capable of giving her what she so desperately needs, willing to run the risk of diving off the emotional cliff for a chance at the real thing. Her character is the lynchpin of the story. And Jennifer Lawrence is nowhere to be found here. The success of the movie rides on her shoulders and she is brilliantly up to the task. Her talent is embarrassing.<br /><br />The film is unapologetically romantic but dismissing it as a simple romance is missing the point. It deals with family, friendship, truth, sacrifice, and love as imperfect ideals worth fighting for regardless of your place in the world.  It is a brave film. Do yourself a favor, go see it. It is ultimately a joyous affirmation of life's possibilities. And who doesn't need a little of that?
B008MG1E4A|5.0|it's easy reading and  holds my attention.  i enjoy books like this.  Books that i do not have to use a dictionary to look up words so that i can understand what the author is trying to say.  Books don't need to be complicated to be a good book.

B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I thought this movie was okay.  It was more violent then I thought.  I believe it would be more instesting if you're a big science fiction fan or Bruce Willis fan! :)
B005LAII8K|5.0|Looper was easily one of the best movies to come out in 2012. A completely original, action packed, and thought provoking film that succeeds in actually tying in great characters and real emotion. Very few movies succeed in doing this. The performances are fantastic, with a wonderful turn from Bruce Willis who finally gets to show his range as an actor (something he rarely ever gets to do). Not to mention Joseph Gordon-Levitt turning in an eerie performance as a young Willis, there is one scene in particular where I can literally picture Willis at that age looking and acting exactly like that. Levitt's facial expressions and mannerisms are astounding, having clearly studied (or just hung around) Willis for quite awhile.<br /><br />There isn't enough I can say about this film, it was my second favorite film of the year behind The Dark Knight Rises (getting the edge because of my love & respect for Christopher Nolan and what he has done for the Batman series). Director Rian Johnson has a terrific vision and style that really makes this film unique from most any sci fi flicks, mixing both the sci-fi and western genres beautifully. His script alone is something to behold. Loved this movie, I cannot recommend it enough
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Christian Bale makes a good Batman.  My only criticism is he often whispers so I can't always understand what he says.  Otherwise its worth watching, even re-watching!
B003TH2G4Y|5.0|The first time I caught Seeker was midway through Season 1 Episode 8, \\"Denna.\\" My interest was piqued, so the next day at school, I sat and watched the first 7 episodes on Hulu to catch up. I was hooked. Since then, I've seen the series probably 5 times with friends and Save Our Seeker groups. We're still here. We aren't giving up. Bring back good television. Bring me The Seeker.

B000NIVJGI|5.0|I grew up to this movie, I used to watch it two times a day because I loved the dancing in it. I didn't realize until I was a teenager the risque parts of the movie because as a little kid I just thought the music and dancing were fun. Now that I'm in my 20's I can appreciate every aspect of this movie and still think that it's a great romantic movie. So snuggle up with some wine and enjoy!

B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|Ok, so Diamonds is a cheesy song, but it's definitely catchy and fun to listen to. But I really think her best song is Stay. I heard it live when I was at the rehearsal for SNL and she was AMAZING! I immediately went home to listen to the song a billion times; however, on the album it's a duet instead of a solo ballad. Would have preferred the solo ballad on the album but still really good.

B009PDO946|3.0|I've been a committed viewer of the Vienna Philharmonic New Year's Day concerts since the early 1980s, when Lorin Maazel took over the duties from Willi Boskovsky, leading the concert in consecutive years as conductor and occasional violin soloist.<br /><br />There have been many memorable New Year's Day concerts over the decades: those led by Maazel, Karajan, Kleiber, Prêtre, Mehta, Muti and Abbado, for example. Even Ozawa's single star turn in 2002 was surprisingly enjoyable. There was always a feeling of anticipation with the approach of this concert, and for the most part, it delivered the goods, most notably when conductors one might consider to be a bit staid in their typical stage demeanor let their hair down and joined in this traditional lighthearted welcome of the new year.<br /><br />Recent years have been less consistent in delivering an event that can be called truly memorable, especially in regards to the quality of the music making on display. In fact, I count more than a few of the recent concerts to be failures: both of Harnoncourt's appearances (2001 & 2003) and Barenboim's cheerlessly pedantic appearance in 2009. Mixed in with the \\"not so much\\" concerts given in the first decade of the new century was a stellar first appearance by Georges Prêtre in 2008, followed by his still-enjoyable but less-stellar follow-up in 2010, and Mariss Jansons' two appearances in 2006 & 2012.<br /><br />Franz Welser-M&ouml;st (FWM) made his first appearance at this concert back in 2011, a concert in which I felt he acquitted himself well. He's a native Austrian and the current head of the Vienna State Opera, ie: the kind of person one would assume is to the manner born. Alas, FWM's reappearance in 2013 is a decided come down from the promise he displayed but two years ago.<br /><br />On the one hand, FWM is to some extent held hostage to the repertoire selected for this concert. Fully eleven of the twenty pieces played on this concert receive their NYD concert premieres. That happens because the concert has been programmed to salute the 90th birthday of Hedwig-Aigner Strauss (who was in attendance at this concert), by featuring music of her great-grandfather, Josef Strauss, and by including works of Richard Wagner and Giuseppe Verdi, both of who were born in 1813, and who are having the 200th anniversaries of their births celebrated in the music world. This leads to a bit of a hodgepodge of music that might not otherwise feature so prominently on this concert, ie: fewer warhorses/chestnuts and more obscure repertoire. It also puts a lot of pressure on the performers to deliver the goods to the audience - it's always a bit harder to sell a \\"new\\" piece to an audience that is expecting to hear many of the old favorites.<br /><br />I can see the Josef/Richard/Giuseppe concept working in theory: pulling off such a repertoire mix would be child's play in the hands of a Mehta or a Maazel. But FWM is not either of those conductors, and his best effort here falls short in making the case for these new arrivals. They are given straight-forward performances that - to me - aren't much better than highly competent run through-s. It's almost as if FWM is a second-string conductor who has prepared the orchestra for the star conductor - who then fails to show for the concert, and which results in the second-stringer being shoved out on the stage, with fingers crossed that somehow the traditional magic will just happen.<br /><br />It doesn't.<br /><br />Lest I imply that this concert fails due solely to the unusual repertoire, I'm sorry to report that that's not the worst of it. The biggest disappointment comes when FWM tries his hand at the few warhorses that are included on this concert. It starts off with a rendition of \\"Music of the Spheres\\" (Sph&auml;renkl&auml;ge) that is blanched to an interpretive white when set alongside Muti's expressive 2004 version, let alone Karajan's colorful and nostalgic version from 1987, which is in a class of its own. It doesn't fare much better when considered against the virtuosic interpretation of Carlos Kleiber from 1992. FWM is careful to a fault in this piece, missing any feeling of echt-Viennese nostalgia that is always coupled with a sense of sadness.<br /><br />The same goes for FWM's interpretation of \\"Where the Lemon Trees Blossom\\" - a piece that drips heavily of nostalgia mixed with a feeling of regret, if not remorse. In FWM's hands, it's a well-played (if cautious) laying out of the notes that seems to betray a conductor who maybe hasn't yet suffered enough in this life to bring an experienced perspective to his music making.<br /><br />But the worst misfire occurs via a big helping of forced humor that falls absolutely flat in Strauss Father's \\"Carnival of Venice,\\" where FWM's handing out of stuffed animals to the orchestral soloists comes off as a contrived moment of conductor and orchestra \\"just bein' regular guys.\\" This is the kind of staged, too-cute-by-half, wince-inducing \\"humor\\" that reinforces the idea that classical music is entirely disconnected from normal human experience. You know - like when you feel the obligation to laugh at the stale jokes being told by your rich uncle. Surely, classical music can do better than this embarrassing substitute for actual humor!<br /><br />In the encore section of the concert, we're offered a \\"Blue Danube\\" minus many of its internal repeats (which makes for a Blue Danube dispatched in record time), and a Radetzky March on automatic pilot, save for a few ineffective accelerandi that crop up when they're not needed.<br /><br />One of FWM's glaring faults in this repertoire is that he lets the energy sag in the transitional bars of the longer pieces, pieces that feature many different sections built on new themes (\\"Music of the Spheres\\" is the best example). In the best hands, these transitional bars have a frisson that makes one excitedly anticipate the next big section in the composition. In FWM's hands, these transitional bars fall flat - they feel like a vamp, rather than a wind-up to the coming pitch.<br /><br />Another problem I notice is a lack of unanimity in the string playing. Listen closely enough and you'll occasionally hear the sound of one violin sticking out from the rest of the section. It's a small thing, but it serves to testify that the orchestra isn't playing in the kind of \\"zone\\" they do under the best conductors, when everyone is of the same mind, and is being swept along by the vision of the conductor. It's the kind of high-level musical nuance that only gets noticed by its absence.<br /><br />As far as production values, the BluRay's HD picture and camera work are excellent, while the soundtrack lacks bloom, though it seems to get better as the concert proceeds.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this concert after FWM's 2011 appearance, but this concert was quite disappointing. It's average, at best. Considering my disappointment in both FWM and Harnoncourt in this concert, I'm starting to wonder if perhaps this concert is best kept away from being entrusted to the natives.<br /><br />I'm hoping that this concert gets back on track over the next few years, though the fact that Daniel Barenboim has been announced as conductor for the 2014 affair doesn't bode well for that hope being realized any time soon. I get that many of the star conductors of this event are well past their sell-by date, but there has to be *somebody* out there who can restore the excitement and sense of event this concert has always delivered in strictly musical terms. Perhaps Vienna should simply alternate Prêtre and Jansons for the next six years and hope someone new comes along who warrants an invitation.<br /><br />Recommended only for completists like me, VPO junkies and the FWM fan club.<br /><br />Two-and-a-half stars.t doesn't fare much better when considered against the virtuosic interpretation of Carlos Kleiber from 1992. FWM is careful to a fault in this piece, missing any feeling of echt-Viennese nostalgia that is always coupled with a sense of sadness.<br /><br />The same goes for FWM's interpretation of \\"Where the Lemon Trees Blossom\\" - a piece that drips heavily of nostalgia mixed with a feeling of regret, if not remorse. In FWM's hands, it's a well-played (if cautious) laying out of the notes that seems to betray a conductor who maybe hasn't yet suffered enough in this life to bring an experienced perspective to his music making.<br /><br />But the worst misfire occurs via a big helping of forced humor that falls absolutely flat in Strauss Father's \\"Carnival of Venice,\\" where FWM's handing out of stuffed animals to the orchestral soloists comes off as a contrived moment of conductor and orchestra \\"just bein' regular guys.\\" This is the kind of staged, too-cute-by-half, wince-inducing \\"humor\\" that reinforces the idea that classical music is entirely disconnected from normal human experience. You know - like when you feel the obligation to laugh at the stale jokes being told by your rich uncle. Surely, classical music can do better than this embarrassing substitute for actual humor!<br /><br />In the encore section of the concert, we're offered a \\"Blue Danube\\" minus many of its internal repeats (which makes for a Blue Danube dispatched in record time), and a Radetzky March on automatic pilot, save for a few ineffective accelerandi that crop up when they're not needed.<br /><br />One of FWM's glaring faults in this repertoire is that he lets the energy sag in the transitional bars of the longer pieces, pieces that feature many different sections built on new themes (\\"Music of the Spheres\\" is the best example). In the best hands, these transitional bars have a frisson that makes one excitedly anticipate the next big section in the composition. In FWM's hands, these transitional bars fall flat - they feel like a vamp, rather than a wind-up to the coming pitch.<br /><br />Another problem I notice is a lack of unanimity in the string playing. Listen closely enough and you'll occasionally hear the sound of one violin sticking out from the rest of the section. It's a small thing, but it serves to testify that the orchestra isn't playing in the kind of \\"zone\\" they do under the best conductors, when everyone is of the same mind, and is being swept along by the vision of the conductor. It's the kind of high-level musical nuance that only gets noticed by its absence.<br /><br />As far as production values, the BluRay's HD picture and camera work are excellent, while the soundtrack lacks bloom, though it seems to get better as the concert proceeds.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this concert after FWM's 2011 appearance, but this concert was quite disappointing.

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Liked this book for a quick read.  As an adult I felt it was a little like other stories I had heard before (don't want to give away anything) but there are some nice twists and turns.  It made me purchase the second book in the series so I guess I am hooked.
1878424319|5.0|Everyone should read this book.  Such simple things to learn & live by. The world would be much better & everyone would be much happier if people would live by these simple agreements that you make to yourself. Why wouldnt everyone want to be a better self?
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I own all 3 of the regular DVD`s of Jurassic Park.<br />Saw the good and bad reviews but moved ahead and ordered the set.<br />Stunning!  Much -  Much more clear and crisp.<br />The sound is also much better than the old regular DVD`s.<br />The foliage is much crisper and more colorful - the animals are incredibly clearer and crisper.<br />Can even see the skin imperfections of the actors - actresses - Ha. But that is good.<br />Well worth ordering.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like having a calculator on my Kindle Fire because I might want to add something up while I'm setting in my chair and I don't want to get up and look for a calculator. Its very nice and works great.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I absolutely love this app. I was a huge fan of Lightning Bug but has started skipping and force closing lately. Saw this as the FAoTD one day and decided OK, I would try it. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because it would be nice combine different sounds: like heavy rain, wind chimes and thunder so you'd have a personalized option. Sent suggestion via email to developer and no less than 30 mins I got a response that said, &quot;Coming soon&quot; Now I really can't wait for an update. Then I will happily give 5 stars. Give it a chance, its good...really good!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Hands down the best weather app I've found. Very customizable. Several nice widgets to choose from. Love the alerts and notification. What doesn't this app do?
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game just isn't as good as the first one. It needs an up date that gives you more things to buy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've only had this game for 5 minutes and I already love it.... OKAYY!!!! I've had it for 5 months but I still love it
B00A4OALL0|4.0|Don't pay attention the one star review. It's from a guy that always thinks that everything is black or white. Everyone of its reviews is 1 or 5 five stars.<br />This is a great recording. We don't need to dance to apreciate good music.<br />Thank you for your life plenty  of music mr. Shorter
B00280LYIM|5.0|Great book. Actually lives up to the hype. Fun reading in it's simplest form. No uber-pretty people, no ridiculous preaching on one of the authors pet issues. Just good human growth the natural and normal way; through living.<br /><br />What kind of hero is Percy Jackson? He's not going to win my beating someone into submission with a handy school bus, but he in no way lacks courage or strong convictions and the will to act on them.<br /><br />Great book.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|I hardly ever have to FORCE myself to finish a book....which is what happened with this one.  I really liked the way it started out, and even enjoyed the mystery surrounding his grandfathers death.  I am an OUTLANDER fan and enjoy time travel.  I suppose it went beyond imagination with me when the birds true identity was revealed, who was really chasing him, and how unraveled it ended.  It left me wondering who ever really cared for these Peculiar Children to begin with in their time warp, or not.  Maybe you'll have insight that I missed in this one!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I felt the emotions of all the characters. I love Jodi Picoult and will always read her work.
B0046LUH20|4.0|I saw the 1999 film version of \\"The Love Letter\\" before I read the novel.  Kate Capshaw was great as Helen, the book store owner who has an affair with a 20 year old college student.  But the movie included a major character named George whom I kept expecting to appear in the novel---but he never did.  Played in the film by Tom Selleck, George was a local fire chief who had been in love with Helen since they were high school students.  He was divorcing his wife and he also served as a romantic distraction to Helen as she carried on her affair with the young guy.  In other words---two men were in love with Helen---the young guy and the fireman---and she found it difficult to fully commit to either man.  So when I read the novel, I was very surprised that the \\"fireman\\" didn't even exist.  Not only that, but in the film, Helen relinquishes her \\"hold\\" on her young lover, encouraging him to go back to college feeling free and unattached.  Also, in the film version, Helen has strong regrets that she and her fireman didn't make a go of it.  In the novel, Helen continues her infatuation with her young lover, even on the final page.  Helen's mother, along with her grandmother and Miss Scattergoods, were basically the same in both the novel and the film.  However, in the film, Miss Scattergoods works at the post office, not the library.  And Ellen DeGeneres, as Helen's book store assistant in the film, turned her character into a stronger, funnier version of how she was portrayed in the novel.  This is one example of how a wonderfully written novel becomes an excellent film---despite major changes from the scriptwriter.  After you've read the book, see the film version.  Both are good, despite their differences.

B008B9JTLI|3.0|Samaritan(released Mar/12),otherwise known as Fury,stars Samuel L. Jackson as Foley,Gil Bellows as Bartender Bill,Tom Wilkinson as Xavier,Luke Kirby as Ethan and others.Filmed in and around Toronto,this drama of a grift/con gone wrong,with a twist,is nothing we have not seen over and over again,and nothing in its make up suggests it to stand head and shoulders above the rest.<br />The story involves an ex grifter,Jackson,who gets out of prison after 25 years.He went away for having been forced to kill his partner in crime.Now Kirby,his ex partner's son,is back and is dogging Jackson and wants an explanation as to why Jackson killed his dad.He gets a pretty grim story.The son is running a club,ultimately owned by Wilkinson,who comes around every so often to check out his property.Thrown into this mix is a young lady who Kirby gets to cozy up with Jackson.He spurns her advances but the next night she comes into a bar with a john,and he forces himself on her in the bathroom.He breaks up the situation and the young lady,after that night,keeps asking after Jackson repeatedly until one night she finds him.They end up a little drunk and back at her place.The two eventually end up sleeping together,with Jackson moving in.<br />Things are starting to get a little too comfortable for Jackson who,with a suspicious eye,asks the girl if Kirby sent him.She admits at first he did but after it was her choice,as she developed real feelings for him.One day Kirby comes sniffing around yet again with an idea for a con.When Jackson refuses Kirby tells him that his girlfriend is really his daughter.Jackson is totally gobsmacked and gets physically sick.Jackson goes to a close friend of the woman he had the child with and who brought up his daughter and she confirms his suspicions.The next time though he meets Kirby,Kirby has a deal he cannot refuse or otherwise his daughter will find out the truth.Jackson is forced to go along with a grift to con Kirby's boss.Kirby enlists the aide of a lady who is totally familiar with the con game,but she ends up hanging herself at Kirby's apartment to get out from under Kirby's debt and the huge risk involved.Jackson walks out only to have Kirby show up at the bar he is in and he hands Jackson his phone.On the other end is his daughter pleading for his help.She is pretending to Wilkinson that she is Jacskon's daughter and she is in debt for $1.5 million.The con has started without him.Jackson may be enraged but he now must go along to save his daughter.<br />Jackson appears at an abandoned house and the con begins.Just as things are rolling along Jackson daughter spills the beans and admits the whole thing is a con to Wilkinson,much to Jackson and Kirby's amazement.The girl also tells Jackson that she already knows she is his daughter.When the dust all clears Kirby and Wilkinson are dead and Jackson is severely wounded and his daughter near death.Jackson rushes her to a prison friend who knows a little bit of doctoring skills.He is forced to give his daughter a blood transfusion,which unfortunately ends up killing him.The film ends as his daughter,with a renewed life,and the money earned from the con gone bad,is walking on a tropical beach.<br />The story certainly has its twists and turns and the cast,especially Jackson,are on game throughout.The picture is ably directed and edited but there is just nothing here out of the ordinary to speak of to set it apart from a myriad of other such films from the past,recent and older.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1.Extras include interviews and a featurette.<br />All in all a pedestrian film of grifting and its consequences.An average film with an average mark.lady who is totally familiar with the con game,but she ends up hanging herself at Kirby's apartment

B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great tool, worked to repair knicked up knife edge immediately...used on various knives and sharpens with good results.<br />Good design and useability.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun I can play this game all day its that fun itsnjust amazing how so many poeple love to play subway surfers I mean my whole family play this game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|For those that haven't played the original, you run and are chased by monsters. You never stop running and if you stumble on something the monsters catch up to you. You can die in a bunch of different ways ( face planting into a tree, falling into the water, burning, getting caught by the monsters, etc.)<br />TR2 takes the exact same formula, but adds little touches that make it a pretty refreshing sequel.<br />Controls: As your character runs you can affect what they do. Swiping up makes him/her jump, swiping down is a slide, swiping to either side when presented with a split in the path sends you down that path. Leaning the Kindle (or whatever device) to the left or right moves you to the left or right of the path. TR2 added a lot more leaning into the game, making you move your device around a lot more than I did in the first one. You can also slide down ropes and ride mine carts, which is new.<br />Collectables: While you run you collect coins which can be used to buy things in the store. These goodies add bonus points and extend the amount of time a power up lasts, or you can get new skins for your character. You will run into power ups while running around. On top of this is a trophy/achievement system that rewards you for doing in-game challenges (Run so many meters without collecting coins for instance)<br />Graphics: Pretty much the same from the last game although it seems a bit crisper. Add that to the new environments and it's a nice change.<br />Overall: Great additions to the original game. The in-game challenges and unlockables make you keep coming back for more. Good for all ages, my 8 year old, 16 year old and myself all play it!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Its new and different; the actors are good. Its a refreshing change from the &#34;Reality TV&#34; garbage and boring cop shows on.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|Premise is interesting but characters are one dimensional. Relationships are superfical and even sometimes cartoonish. I finished it because I WAS interested enough to find out what happens in the end..........but that was a disappointment too.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|If you are like me and like to haphazardly click \\"BUY NOW\\" buttons on the internet, you may have purchased this movie without reading the title or description. Justly, you may be indignant with the knowledge that you were entertained by something that was not mainstream. You now have to live with the guilt of knowing that you, a grown individual, were entertained by something that was animated and not live-action. You must hide this movie in your house or your friends will silently judge you as some type of anime geek when they see it on your shelf. If only Amazon had put an all-caps warning in the title stating, \\"FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT ENJOY READING THINGS: THIS IS NOT THE NEW BATMAN MOVIE\\", then my money would not have been wasted on this dark, edgy, highly entertaining animated tribute to an all-time classic graphic novel, portraying Batman in his originally intended grittier self.<br /><br />Good day, sirs.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great story telling!  I'm hooked.  My mom, sister and I all watch it and then get together and hash it our over tea!
B007HACDLK|4.0|This book was good but not quite up there with the rest. With that said I would still read any Vince Flynn book without hesitation.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I watched this with my Teen age daughter and we laughed our tails off. A bit crude in some spots but still funny.
B005XLN97M|5.0|This is a fun toy!  I bought this for my daughter for Christmas at a Lightning Deal for $20!  It is so worth $20 and I was so excited to get the product. I saw it as high as $45 and I would not spend that much on this toy.  As others have stated, it's not that durable and does come apart - not daily for us - but often.  I agree too that it would be nice if it didn't have so much pink and purple but most Barbie stuff is just pink so the purple is nice too.  This product helps foster my daughter's creative side and she plays with it often.  Even her little sister enjoys playing with it and she's 14 months old!  If you find it on sale you should definitely buy it - you will not be disappointed.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|This movie is a great film for kids and adults, i love that it's funny and extra bits in there just put it over the top.

When you've got me before I've finished the first chapter, you've got me to the end! The characters and storyline in this book were very believable and entertaining. I never go into specifics in a review. Read the book if you want specifics. I loved the book, and it's another Badacci masterpiece! I highly recommend it!

B0084HJE0S|1.0|No examples of the differences between html and html5....<br />No samples of a simple page made up  in html5 code.<br /><br />Just boring reading....not something we need when someone wants examples of what is being discussed.
B005MMYEF8|1.0|Only watched 2 episodes. There is no historical basis for this series and the debauchery is quite sickening. I am furious Amazon recommended this series for us. Want a refund.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|8/10<br /><br />I rated this book 8/10 because it was hard to get into but the middle and very end of the book was amazing! I think that anyone who loves suspense and a good love story should definitely read this book:)
B0055Q5F36|2.0|Apparently this is just for the AT&T version? I'm sure it's amazing for the Galaxy S II for AT&T! Oh well.

B000SEIDR0|5.0|This book will change your views of food and how we feed America. Thankfully, my Ecology teacher required us to read this in college, and I am grateful for it. After reading this, I wonder what past generations would think of our current grocery store chains and how unsustainable the current food chain is. I recommend Joel Salatin's book \\"Folks This Just Ain't Normal\\" for a further eye opening reading experience.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Great deal, great movies, great quality. Star Wars just looks amazing on Blu-Ray. Packaging is pretty nice too!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Suzanne Collins surprised me with her hunger games. It was unique, deep, and thought provoking. It was everything a book should be and more. Than there's Catching Fire. I got the 2nd one the day after I was done with the 1st. I couldn't wait to read  more about Katniss and the Capitol. Although it was good, in some parts it kind of felt like a replay of the 1st book. It differed in most things though and by the end, I was trying had not to just get up and scream with excitement. Yes, Catching Fire is a good sequel. Almost there. Almost perfect.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love this game. They play it about an hour a day!:)<br />I like alot of the characters!<br />  From,<br />  James

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game. Way better than the original temple run. Has levels to says keep you busy, plus just a addictive game. Love it!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|its a lot of fun but its hard to understand what ur supposed. to do for what obstacle. the graphics could be better too
B006M4F67A|5.0|Can't get enough of this game.  Love that as you progress, the game gets harder. This is difficult to put down.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I saw my nephew playing this game. He was glued to it. I decided to download and try it myself. Surprisingly, this game is pretty fun. It is nowhere near a mind challenge but does pass the time.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Loved this sci-fi series.  Just wish there was more to watch! Aliens, strong family bonds, interpersonal drama and betrayal, all make for exciting entertainment.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this book all the collection really can't wait until the next book I love to read about mythology
B006ZZAN60|5.0|I got this to show my daughter all of the instruments, after I stumbled across a few clips while surfing. This is a beautiful concert, and the audio is wonderfully mastered. Loreena is, of course, fabulous, but the other musicians are amazing as well.
1609611543|4.0|Heard about this on the Tom Barnard podcast. Read the book and I ma much healthier for it. It helped with my glucose levels and lost 12lbs just by cutting out the wheat like suggested. Very interesting read recommend for those trying to figure out why they don't feel well or trying to lose weight.

B002QEXN2K|5.0|Everytime I hear these songs on my Ipod - I almost travel through time, to my youth, refelcting on his lyrics, singing along with the melody.  John Mayer absolutely Rocks my world and this &#34;album&#34; (do they even call them that anymore), was satsifying and soothing.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|This is obviously a spin on Yahtzee! and it's a lot of fun, just like the original. Running it on a SG3 and have no problems, love playing against Facebook friends - it's one of those games that is &#34;fast&#34; to get into and play your turn, then get back to the day. Words with Friends and many of the other games take way too long to make your move - I like fast and fun :)

B002MQYOFW|4.0|i think the book hunger games is very interesting. i feel anyone that reads it will enjoy it very much. i cant wait to read the others
B003B02O14|5.0|Hard to put this book down.  A constant tug-of-war between the &#34;good&#34; guy and the bad guys.<br />You can't stop reading at the end of a chapter.
B003C5FMEE|5.0|Trombone Shorty can combine classic jazz sensibilities with modern rock better than anyone I've ever heard. Despite the name, he's an amazing multi-instumentalist and he can sing as well. This album has great variety; some vocal, some instrumentals. Some of it's light, but some of it's rock. Some of it's upbeat, but some of his lyrics are critical (especially \\"Right to Complain\\"). The last track is a quick one-minute bit of New Orleans street music; pure brass band jamming. It's an invitation, a reminder that what's on the album is never going to compare to a live musician on a winding New Orleans cobblestone street.<br /><br />That being said, it's a really good album.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|This is the only book I have read of John Locke's.  I guess I didn't come across anything earth shattering but it was better than most books that give you no information at all.  I did learn a couple things I had not heard before and that's why I give it 4 stars because it was better than information promised from other books that don't deliver.
B003ODL004|3.0|This feels to me like a pretty much archetypical Hans Zimmer score. Simple and powerful. Mixing orchestral, rock, and electronic elements. There's a reason he scores so many big movies. It's a little repetitive and not a long album (49 min), but an enjoyable listen. I'd recommend checking out his Batman scores first (especially TDK), which are more musically diverse, but if you like Zimmer's unapologetically in your face style, this is a decent album.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Bought this game originally for my daughters Nabi 2, but after watching her play it for while, helping her occasionally, I decided to pick it up for my iPad2. Wow. This thing is crazy addictive. I've already spent way too much time on it. Even bought the extra packs. I've only got about 90 boards left total, having done over 1300 boards thus far. The 14x14 and 15x15 are REALLY tough though.  Still, this is one of the very best puzzle games I've played in a very long time.<br /><br />Looking forward to checking out their Bridges game next.
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|It's jazz. It's funk. It's rock. It's soul. It's New Orleans.<br /><br />There are some great dance beats in here, but Trombone Shorty is also a virtuoso and an ambassador of NOLA culture, and is to be appreciated as an artist. Like its predecessor, it has a mix of vocal and instrumental tracks, and a range of styles. And it concludes with a quick New Orleans street jam; a musical invitation to come see this live. Can't stop listening to this album a year later. Even better than Backatown. Buy it.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|Having been a fan since 'When I look Into Your Eyes', 2001, this is the worst ever.  I agree with the others, this does not showcase her piano talent nor her amazing interpretive vocal style.  I was wondering why she did such a desperate 'T and A' cover....guess that's all there was to offer up this time.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|I built my son a gaming computer and this CPU has worked great with no issues. I would recommend this item especially for the price
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is abiusolutly a great. Game I love it but what needs some work is how much the stuff costs like the people you play or the boards you hut but the special power up are fine I guess and I think you should have a contest with it like who gets the most miles gets something.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This cooler barely fits in our case but it keeps the CPU very cool. It looks good and works great and I would recommend this item
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Every chapter seems to end with a cliff hanger or key discovery that leads to a commercial break.  But a fun read, but heavily reliant on random alignment of coincidence. Still i' is fiction.
1592407889|5.0|This is a well written fast paced book that is very interesting! The book gives insights into a life that most of us could never imagine... The dark side... The lighter moments... The confusion, complications and turmoil of growing up in a international arena... The love of a daughter for her parents shines through.
B00008S7KC|1.0|I received this video wife out of town going to watch concert. I could not get this DVD to work in any of my DVD playors. I think it might be a pirated DVD. Do not buy.
B00004RF9B|5.0|to hubby he l o v e s  i t so so so so so so so so much !
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book had me excited to read more and to find out more about what happened. I was somewhat sad when it ended because I was enjoying it so much. I will definitely try to find more books like it!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|love it very very very v  e  r  y  m  u c h t h a n k y ou
B0049IHX2C|4.0|This was an entertaining movie and kept my interest. I would recommend this for young adults and over.  The Dog was very amusing.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I loved this book just finished the trilogy it was so good I was kinda depressed after it was over.
B0083GQVXI|5.0|Very good movie. Shows how if you think something is wrong with your child, probably there is and you need to take action.
B0091REZMW|5.0|It is fun but tricky. I recommend that you play this game. In my opinion it&acute;s a good game. Free? Not completely because you have to buy diamonds, but other wise free.
074356619X|5.0|This is a life changing CD....<br />You will feel every part of this life-changing book by the beautiful voice of Rhonda Byrne....<br />The brilliant writer who discovered the actual SECRET to happiness.....
B0086213XW|1.0|that marriage should be abandoned the second it feels \\"incomplete\\" for new lovers (who will surely feel \\"incomplete\\".)  Maybe this writer director was raped during childhood, slept with lots of losers, then everyone who could possibly advance her career, and is now a man hating lesbian with fantasies of retribution.  It's the most cynical movie I have ever seen bar none.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game pulled me right in, even from the short free version. I don't usually buy the full versions but this one I'm going since it was so good.
0307990850|5.0|i read one of lee child's books and bought all of his books. i will not buy anymore due to the change of character in his movies. he does not suit the image projected of jack reacher.
B009A9BEHU|4.0|I enjoyed this DVD, Coldplay are great entertainers and have all the latest toys that make a stadium concert a lot of fun (the Brisbane concert that I attended was fantastic).<br /><br />I marked it down one star because I don't think this is Coldplay at their best. I've heard some YouTube videos of the same live songs where Chris's vocals were much stronger, and the mix was much better. Also, Chris drops the F bomb far too much to make it suitable for my children to listen to which is a shame.<br /><br />That aside, Coldplay rock it out better than anyone, and this live performance is brilliant.
0739378341|5.0|i've read most of john grisham books. very good stories. i enjoy suspence stories.i enjoy lee child's as he has only one hero but the changes of character are enjoyable also.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like temple run 2 a lot. 1 its free 2 so many new features 3 the big gorilla :)
B000QFW7UA|1.0|I bought the Goonies / Gremlins / Gremlins 2 combo. I got very tired of listening to the boys yelling and screaming from start to end. Many scenes dragged along too long. I had to fast forward to alleviate the annoyance. I do not understand the 4 1/2 rating. Don't waste your money and time.
B004SIP8JI|4.0|This movie is a full, rich, well thought out production. the focus is on an 1850's gentleman who falls through a crack in the line. He finds himself in a big city with no friends, no job and no idea what has happened. The segments are tight and dense on the screen set up so we are called to focus by making the small space the central point of the screen. I find myself amazed at the way the invisible becomes important. It was fun watching this and working through the implements created by the Special Effects Department. the tight spaces are used to create tension and excitement in the story
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|My wife and I simply adore Shaun and the gang... I only wished that they made more of them.With different writers for the episodes, the series never gets stale as many shows tend to do these days.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|The subject matter reflects a dark reality seldom shown on film. The best acting of Denzel's career.  Don Cheadle turns in another reliable performance.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I've been playing this a few hours, now, and it's a lot of fun.  The levels get harder, as you go along, but you can capture tools that help even the odds (add time, break some blocks, etc).  It's pretty addicting and will have you wanting to play &quot;just one more level&quot; before quitting.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|my daughter sang the songs for 3 days after we saw the movie!  i forgot what a great story it is!
1455502758|4.0|Watching Chris on TV and having read some of his older works, I wasn't too surprised what I found in here.  And I, even knowing the final outcome going in, still found I couldn't put it down.  Simply put, he was a marvelous writer and this was a marvelous book.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|If you want to be depressed, watch this. For those of you who can't take too much truth- keep watching television instead.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|after the first day of playing couldn't play anymore because it would crash EVERY TIME I tried to load it.  Waste of time downloading it.
B005OMOKN2|5.0|Bought this battery based on the &#34;frequently bought together&#34; logo that always appears when purchasing items from Amazon. Wrong battery!  I didn't check further and now I'm out the expense and time to return and replace this battery.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|Rankin and Rebus continue to entertain, amuse and astound! The beat goes on-!  Read this book; you will not be sorry!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I bought this DVD for my daughter.  She absolutely loves this movie and watches it all of the time.  This item shipped really fast.
B001OC4HSE|3.0|of course i remember this being a better movie as a kid. My son loved it!  Movie graphics have come a long way!
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|I bought this move for my daughter.  This item shipped super fast.  I was impressed on how fast I received it.
1616550414|5.0|270 pages of nerdgasms! This book is for the hardcore legend of zelda nerds and shows the entire developing process for the various games and characters. so amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0062238868|1.0|Have a look at this YouTube review and try to give the whole subject of sniping and the wars on Iraq and Afghanistan a lot of thought.    [...]    Are you sure you still like the book, the man who wrote it, and what he did?
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|Way violent, somewhat true to the book, &#34;The Wettest County&#34;, not true depiction of the county or the culture - actor who plays Forrest nailed the accent :), profane language not indicative of the time or place, scenery off as well.<br />However, if watching for something different, and just entertainment - acting is good - character development ok.
1400052181|5.0|wonderful book about a moral situation that is read about tin the media today. gave food for thought and the entire book club loved the book.
B009MO5G90|5.0|i now have every resident evil out so far and so far i'm still pleased, i dont watch to many zombie killin movies but this series has me hooked
B0043X1FL8|5.0|I viewed the movie while I was reading Awakenings, and it made me want to see the documentary which Dr Sacks mentioned in the book.Both actors have great range and were more than up to the demands of the material. My guy had not read anything about what happened but he enjoyed it too, comming at it with no background information.
B00AODKSAA|4.0|i would suggest this movie to anyone who likes or loves vampire movies. it was better than i thought it would be.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I am a sci-fi nut. I have followed all the launches since 1958.the book keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is one catastrophe after another. It is also a tribute to one's ingenuity to survive. On the downside it is very technical. If your not familiar with the workings of NASA and JPL you may get a little lost.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoyed this app. Unfortunately, it is an in-game purchase game, but you can still play it without having to pay. If you like games like Airport City you will like this game. I think it is appropriate for all ages.
0143034901|5.0|First book I have read of this author and I was captivated. The book definitely has an old world feel. Having never been to Barcelona, I could almost feel the city live through he ebb and flow of the story. As the story proceeds to through the unlikely hero Daniel's life, you manage to slowly untangle the similarities that create a web that binds him and the author he is curious about - 'Carax'.<br /><br />The book is so well written that you travel through with Daniel into adulthood never realizing the steps you took with him through the twists and turns of his life. You know as much as he does so the mystery unfolds to the reader at the same pace it does to Daniel.<br /><br />This book reminded me of the classics I love to read even though it was a mystery novel.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|love this game. love horses. My daughter will love this game. she always wanted to be a horse trainer. This will give her a good idea.
B005LN5UOC|4.0|Arrived on time, was easy to sync to ps3 and no trouble talking and hearing other players. Would recommend if you want a simple headset.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|The book I think was sad at the end because the Baudelaire children couldn't move into Justice<br /> Strauss home because she was not a relative of the Baudelaire orphans. One of my favorite part was when Count Olaf thought that violet signed the marriage paper with the hand that she usually rights with which is her right hand but she wrote with her left hand instead. These books are so deliciously evil its like you want to keep reading and never put the book down! I can't wait to get the second book!!!  Keep reading!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Lots of fun. Great way to waste some time. Challenging enough to keep you interested but not too hard. Great rainy day game.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Probably the dumbest game ever. Insults intelligence of both children and adults alike. Not worth your time. There is no thinking involved at all.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|It was a great price and I love buying the dvd/blue-ray combo, that way I can have one at my house and send one home with my granddaughter!
B008Z9L94O|1.0|I bought and returned this album due to skipping and poor sound quality. I could probably live with the sound issues but the skipping in several tracks was too much. If anyone got a good copy of this reissue please let me know from where. Also a little bit of advice for other reviewers. Please review the actual product you are buying not the band. I'm pretty sure anyone that is buying a vinyl reissue of the album already likes the band and doesn't need to know your smashing pumpkin history.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|good movie to watch for a kid 7 years old or older. Love the story line different from other moviies
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoyed the game l<br />the puzzles and story line kept my kids and I busy.  we look forward to our next adventure game with G5.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is a great game. I downloaded the original CrossMe over 8 months ago when it was the free Kindle Fire app of the day, and then CrossMe Color a few months later. I've played these games almost every day since.  The puzzles start out relatively easy and increase in difficulty as you progress through the levels. Some are very challenging and can take hours to complete. I keep hearing about how challenging your brain can help prevent diseases such as Alzheimer's and I would venture to say this one fits the bill! Fun, relaxing, challenging but not impossible, the makings of a perfect game in my estimation.
0349001359|5.0|My daughter asked for this book for her birtday, after liking the movie. I ordered it for her. She is away at college and won't get it till she comes home for her birthday me, so I read it before wrapping.<br /><br />Fast paced, parts are sad, but the perfect amount of humor to balance the two. Love Chris Colfer, and he did a great job. It is a short book with big print, so I read it in a couple of hours. Still an enjoyable read.<br /><br />If you are offended by 4 letter words, it may not be the book for you, but the use of those words is appropriate and fitting to the context.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|It is great.  It was just what I wanted.  I can't think of any other words.  It's odd to have to write more.
B00BB9PVQM|5.0|This is a show that gets your right from the start.  Great show if your looking for something new. Each week it gets better and better.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is an excellent read from a uniquely teenage perspective. Even though I cried through the last half , I highly recommend it. 5 stars for accurate portrayal of the struggle to keep laughing and loving while life is left to live
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Wonderful purchase and brings back memories of &#34;back in the day&#34;. DVDs came in excellent condition and it is great to have all 10 seasons at once. It contains a booklet that lists every episode with a summary and the disc you can find it on. It is a wonderful purchase which I am sharing with my sister.
B00006AUIG|5.0|The film, for any who have not seen it, stands apart from the majority of horror films today, and indeed in the past as well. It is true psychological horror, and relies more on atmosphere and suggestion than on cheap theatrics and in-your-face gore. The narrative builds a little bit slowly, but that is often the case for the genre, and when the film reaches its climax, it is worth the wait. The film will haunt you for days after it ends. If you prefer slashers, this probably isn't the film for you, but if you enjoy artful thrillers and horror that engages your mind as well as your senses, Session 9 is definitely a worthwhile purchase.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Very interesting perspective and a great book all around. Easy read and makes you think which I enjoy the most
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is very fun game. My whole family really enjoy competing against each other. I recommend this game to everyone one.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Love this movie and it just gets better on blu-ray. It is a must for every batman lovers movie library
B00AREIAI8|5.0|OMG BEST APP U FEEL LIKE THEY REALLY ARE YOUR PETS. AND I HAVE A UNICORN. It really is fun if u like to take care of animals
B008XG1X18|3.0|Ordered this but have not used it at all will try to use it when I have more spare time to explore.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its Fun And Challenging i love it and i unlocked so may levels i have so may coins its out of control
B00A757EFW|3.0|This was fun and pretty authentic, but it seemed to me like there was a rapid move toward asking me to update for money.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics and storyline.  Developer has achieved a good balance between puzzle difficulty and narrative flow.  Play for free then buy to support a worthy game developer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the best for people of all ages I have it on my kindle fire and just love it
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Fine In Depth Look at Real Life. No bs look at human need and empathy. Sex as a human right,
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just love love love it and could read it over and over again. Too bad he's not real hmmmm lol
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters do not disappoint. There is still plenty of suspense in the story line to keep you coming back for more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the bomb. I just cant stop playn,. My wife hates me because I'm on this game way to much
B008602KQI|5.0|Love the book series, baby wait for the rest of the movies. Exciting and well made, the love triangle pulls at you. The courage inspires you
B00B49L7JY|4.0|Loved the story. The singer and his story is definitely a feel good movie. Documentary was kinda thrown together. I would watch it again.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Like the game but it only give you like 20 minutes.  There cows and ducks.  I started building but couldn't finish because the free demo was over. ; (
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you like fantasy, kings and dragons you will love Game of Thrones.<br />Great! Cannot stop reading it. Just sucks you in the world of imagination.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|This remastered copy of &#34;Graceland&#34; is one of my top ten favorites of any album ever produced. The blending of African vibes and lower New York flavors, combine to produce one of the most pleasing accomplishments  of Mr. Simon. I am pleased that CD's don't wear out like tapes and records do.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We always watch each series in a single sitting, yes it's that good! I recommend watching only the original UK versions since PBS has been known to edit for their own time slot purposes. The 1st season apparently lost 2 hours of footage!<br /><br />A must see.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|I find that I enjoy the original Sherlock Holmes but that is probably due to my age yet,<br />this was a very good movie, many new turns and surprises and I would recommend it to<br />anyone that enjoys a good mystery with all the 'other' additives.
B00B2JOJIM|5.0|I've been a Depeche Mode fan for years. I look at every new release of theirs very carefully and some new songs were too experimental for my taste. This new single called Heaven sounds like a return to some of the earlier Depeche Mode, but they kept the cool noises, which were a recurring theme on their latest albums. I love it. Can't wait for the album to come out.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I truly believe these are fake. The rubber on the left joystick tore off within a month of purchase. Yes, I do play a lot of FIFA, but if I'm paying $40 for a controller, it should last more than a month. I WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN. The finish of the material is not the same as a real controller, the sticker on the back is different, it doesn't have the same feel as a real controller. I say again, DO NOT PURCHASE.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love having the Kindle reader on my android tablet as well as my PC.....great idea and great app!  Cannot find anything to complain of!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Not sure if you guys need to know what your batteries up too , but i did smart phones are hard to beat but they suck the ;life out of your batterie in minutes not hours . So  i decided to get the batterie app. this one fits the bill widget tells me all i need to know everytime i open my phone its not a mystery how much power i have left !!!
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|Season 3 continues on with the previous 2 seasons but does not overly impress. The promise of the season was more than the delivery yet the season on its own is good.
B00003CXCT|5.0|this is a classic, and everyone should own it. great fun to watch over and over. I highly recommend it.
145551389X|5.0|This was a gift for my brother who is a big fan of hers. He seemed to like it very much, and from what I saw before giving it to him was a good quality book with great quality images that I imagine any fan would enjoy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Imangi, what are you doing to me! Temple Run I wasn't enough of a challenge,  that you had to up the anty? I Love You Guys! Don't stop 'til we get enough!
B00003CXC7|5.0|This is my favorite film by Alfred Hitchcock. It cannot be described very well, it wouldn't do it justice. This is just one of those great movies that today is still amazing. It's just a plus that the beautiful Grace Kelly is in it. James Stewart gives an all star performance as always. What a great actor he is. I understand why Alfred Hitchcock starred him in so many of his movies.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game really had me running to play it at every opportunity that I had...I thought that it could not get any better than this until they came up with Temple Run II...so much fun, that I can't seem to put it down!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The kindle is the perfect way to get our young grandsons interest peeked in math. They love to think they are using the granddads computer.
B00A757EFW|5.0|My wife has been hooked on Pac Man like forever...and when I downloaded this app into my Kindle Fire HD, I think that it was a mistake, because now she won't let me use my Kindle Fire HD...Looks like I'm Going to have buy another one...
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The story line is unique, at least to me. This not my normal genre. Strong characters, suspenseful. If you liked the Hunger Games series you should like this book. As soon as I finished the book i bought the second. I see this series being made into movies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it, it's so cool can also be played on Facebook ... it's addicting 2 thumbs up wish more game s like this was free :) ...
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy continues to amaze me. His grasp of the intense feelings of those in combat or in life threatening circumstances places the reader on the front row.
B008K9SG9K|3.0|I love the singles on this CD. They are powerful songs with great lyrics and a range of inspired, energetic tracks. The CD puts the 2 radio singles and the other 2-3 decent tracks all up front and then it quickly turns to pop junk. The 2nd half of this albulm is nothing like the first. It is cheesy, pop filler to fill a cd. It is like night and day how bad the 2nd half is. I would just buy the sinlges or maybe the first 4 mp3 and save your money.
B004IM14RY|1.0|waste of my time! I started to skip through to see if there was going to be anything different. If you watch the first few minutes you have seen the movie. I would suggest moving on to something else like the very end.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|This is a true story of how God turned a tragedy into a real blessing, and is using Bethany Hamilton to spread the gospel all over the world. I highly recommend this video to anyone. I've watched this video at least 10 times, and am inspired every time I watch it.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I have not finished reading this book and have trouble putting it down.  Can't wait to find out how it ends.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This item is not authentic! It broke as soon as I put my phone in it. I want my money back....not sure if this is a possibility.<br /><br />I watched a YouTube video about real vs. fake and this is fake fake fake.<br /><br />Can't believe I paid this much for a piece of CRAP!<br /><br />This seller should feel awful for lying to people.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Blu Ray fo sho! It looks and sounds great! You will not be disappointed. Highly recommended item. Do but it!
B002JWD6AS|3.0|This book was a kindle deal. It sounded interesting as a change of pace. Although I enjoyed reading the book, I stalled out somewhere in the middle. I am glad I pushed through, because the ending was totally unexpected. Not very realistic, but an unusual premise. Very creatively written.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's wonderful to have an app like this that I can use while listening to music or paying bills on my Kindle!  I've really enjoyed it and use it ALL<br /> the time.<br /><br />Thank you for all the little time saving extras!
B004XGN8W4|4.0|It does bundle up well. The kids like to move it from rooom to room. Sits well in a car.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is is a great game if u liked temple run. U will enjoy it if u strive to do well in life or if u just like to play it helps u with reflexes
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The first time I watched this movie, I felt is was OK. I read the book and loved it. I found myself wanting some of the missing pieces from the book. However, after watching it a second time, I liked it even more. I still like the book better, but the movie was well done.
B0013NAP2G|4.0|I am not happy, the dvd's are skipping in two diffeent dvd players. I would appreciate you sejd me back one that doesnt skip
B008FSCNTK|1.0|After following her career and enjoying almost everything she has ever recorded, this is a mystery.  I don't believe that she's suited for this music, as suspect that I believe it is.  While one can't blame her for 'reaching out' into another genre, it pales in comparison to the fine music and arrangements that people like Claus Ogerman and Alan Broadbent had collaborated with her on.  Far too depressing and vapid lyrics even after listening a couple of times...I couldn't imagine going out to hear this in any setting, but maybe there's an audience for it..at least she and the bank behind it did..but really, they missed it this time.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I had heard this movie was worth the purchase. As mature adults I can honestly saw &#34;we loved it&#34; ! With our in laws we exchange movies all the time & they loved it too ! It is not a corn ball cartoon. It is a well thought out movie. Also it is a movie that can be played over & over....
B0000683DH|5.0|The package was almost like new and the DVD played with no problems.  I like the directors cut much better than the shorter version.  I was 100% satisfied.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I felt that this is probably the absolute best of all the modern Batman movies ! Graphics, sound acting are all TOP shelf. This movie is not &#34;corny&#34; as many have been in the past. I know it's based on a cartoon like obama but this is a action packed feel good movie leaving you wanting more, unlike obama !
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I wasn't completely sure what this book was about when I first began reading, and was ignorantly shocked when the big reveal(s) came- who was in the car, how everything fell together. I say ignorant because I'm sure most people picked up on it, I just wasn't one of them. It is a beautiful story, extremely well written, and a reminder that despite all the evil in the world, there is still beauty and hope. xo
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry Bosch is a great character with gret stories to tell.  This one spans decades and uncovers conspriacies which follow a young reporter from war to the LA Riots.
B00632HWOG|3.0|It used to be really good. Now however, my mailbox is full of spam, and emails are slow, sometimes taking a day. They have good emoticons, but that's not enough. The new layout sucks because the email that is highlighted is below the part that shows all the emails. you have to change the divider to see it. Of course you can stilll double click.
B00138KKP8|3.0|I have put off buying a Ray CD for years since he is heavily played on Sirius XM's The Spectrum and I pretty much get my fill.  I bought this because it was on sale.  I don't dislike it, but it doesn't grab me the way I expected it to.  I was hoping to like it as much as I like say, any Amos Lee CD, but I just don't.  Pretty good, just not great for me.  Bummer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Story line is fantastic and the acting is superb!!!!!!  I also really like this era and enjoy movies during this time.  The costumes are terrific - I just love the whole package......
014312093X|4.0|I read this book as a teenager, borrowing it from my fathers bookshelf.  And that was a while ago, so perhaps four stars seems a bit much.  But this was my first foray into the espionage genre and I haven't slowed down.  It was a look into a supremely exciting, albeit grim business.  I doubled back afterwards to read le Carres earlier works, then on to all of Helen MacInness espionage books and through all of Clancys and so on.  And whenever I find a le Carre book I haven't read, I correct that immediately.  I don't think there are any.  I give TTSS four stars because I remember it as the wonderful adventure that started me on this terrific road.  I can't get it on my Kindle, so I'm re-reading it in paperback.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I had over 100,000 coins and a lot of characters and then one day I click it and all of my stuff is gone. I lie the game but they need to fix the erasing problem
B00AFEXRME|3.0|This is an ok movie<br />I will not give it more than 3 stars<br />Why you might ask is because the only scenes that are good is the plan and the rest to me was just drugs, drinking and more and so much bad language.<br />To me Denzel was cool but the movie its self was not so great<br />This is only one review so who everyone like Denzel then cool he is a great actor, but to much in this movie and so long
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|this movie was awesome, just love how it all worked out and how Willis is still a B.A. Glad i found out about amazon video
0439023521|5.0|I could not put this book down once I started reading it.<br />I saw the movie first and then bought the book, I enjoyed<br />them both.  A definite re-read.  :)
B000002KIK|5.0|black sabbath has so many albums out with a few different line ups each a unique version of this heavy metal band that has been responsible for a lot of other bands forming & carrying that metal torch,this cd will not let you down only wind you up for more
B000SP1SH6|5.0|I'm sure you may have heard that many individuals who follow zen and buddhism consider this a prime example of a life changing experience. I don't know if I'd go that far, however, it is a film where the events of the protagonist tend to mirror those of many individuals who experience a change in their character for the better. I retired a few months ago, and the myth of retirement - that bliss filled world of eternal happiness- is just that, a myth. What is needed is the realization that it is a time of growth and expansion, not a time of eternal cable television and &#34;doing whatever you like&#34;. This film shows that retirement, and many other aspects of life, can be a time of growth, learning, and risk. It's a great movie.
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|I love this movie and now I have it on Blue-Ray fast time getting here, if you havn't seen this movie theres something wrong with you.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the new temple run! it is so fun and personly my favorite game! it is deffently a 5 star app!
B00003CXRP|5.0|My movie arrived in great condition. It was a Christmas present for my fiance and he loved it, considering it is his favorite movie and he did not have it. Fast delivery as well :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Lots of games and levels. Something for everyone.only down is if you want hints. You pay for them.However if just keep playing. You can work it out.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This is an excellent book.  It appealed to my analytical mind, but it wasn't boring at all.  There is an incredible amount of detail and some of it is technical, but it all goes toward bringing the reader into the story.  After reading this book, I feel like I could survive after being abandoned on Mars.  Well, okay. maybe if I were as smart as Mark Watney.<br /><br />For $0.99 it is way cheap.  Buy this book!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is by far, one of the best series I've ever watched.<br />If you haven't discovered this gem, you are missing out.<br />Highly, highly recommend.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|Does what it says it does. Although it is plastic, the bonus is that it is very lightweight and won't add unnecessary lbs to your camera & light rig.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Great movie, but why in the world does this retail for $49.99?!? I hope the disc is made of gold.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surf is the best Game  that you have made it is so cool unlike the way you have the worlld tour it is so fun
B0050DIWFC|2.0|This is a downer of a book. I had to force myself to read to the end, and the ending was horrible!  UGH!!  I did not care for this book and would not recommend it to anyone.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|everything was in extremely great condition and the movie was awesome.it came in a timely fashion and the packaging looked new when i opened it. will enjoy watching this movie over and over again.
0307279189|5.0|Well written, informative and interesting story. I am a barefoot runner now! I could never hit 10 miles before, but after reading this and really letting it register, I got some Merrell Barefoot shoes with Vibram soles and eased into them and what do you know, I hit 10 miles. No chronic knee pain although it still comes out on a lot of downhill, but all in all a huge massive increase in distance and reduction of pain.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|a good little time waster.  Even my husband, who usually doesn't play games will try to beat my high scores.
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|A master of character building. Enjoyable reading after all these years. One of my favorite writers. I learn a lot from him.
B0041CGOZS|5.0|Finally received my c/d .. I was VERY HAPPY with the price the packaging and the quickness of delivery.. So i vote them a 12 on a scale from 1/10
B009FZFONO|5.0|Best series ever! Must see! Will get you hooked from the very first episode! Keeps you on your toes and wanting more.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I loved Downton Abby.  I love that time period and it being British.  The costumes were beautiful and i especially love Maggie Smith.
B00425S1H8|5.0|works for my laser intercepter perfectly...this is the right cord and right fit. comes with its own cd driver-very important..alot dont come with the cd driver and then wont work as the computer wont fin d the right drivers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is good and pretty awesome the first one is best but I think these are good too so play it this is addicting
B005LAIISA|4.0|I bought this part 4 without realizing my nephew didn't have part 2 only 1 and 3. But it was fun to watch.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Denzel Washington  is excellent as an alcoholic who can perform his chosen profession  better drunk than most people could while sober. Still his personal life is in tatters and he can not be 100% sure if his drinking did not make him guilty of needless deaths. One of Washington's best performances in a distinguished career.
B008Y1YKE4|4.0|We watched this christmas eve in front of a roaring fire place and it kept our attention . It was fun for all.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Always a Josh Groban fan and not disappointed with this superb album. A eclectic mixture with a thematic constant.  My two favorites are Jimmy Webb's THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS and  HAPPY IN MY HEARTACHE but you'll find your favorites! Outstanding selection -- Enjoy!
B001ECDVKE|4.0|It's a fun movie in a weird sort of way. Nice ensemble of actors! Alittle creepy seeing SJP's head on a dog.
B007E73MSY|3.0|I have never been a big Soulfly fan (too eclectic for me, I like straight up Rock). This album surprised me; they got pretty intense in this one. My favorite is World Scum.
B004P12SSW|1.0|DO NOT USE AMAZONS SERVICE - QUALITY IS TRASH.  YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD AND THEY HAVE NO CUSTOMER SERVICE NEVER USE THIS SERVICE
B006M9NJFG|5.0|I got the new bear grylls canteen in and it is awesome bigger then what I expected but good holds more very heavy duty and strong and the case goes right on the belt holds great stays in place I really liked the cooking cup so many uses
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Good<br />My son loves it. We have it in paper back but he's still to little for that. It's one of the few books that will hold the attention of a 1 year old.
B0086HGW42|5.0|I can't believe it took this long for this album to make it to the US. He is an amazing singer and this album is great. A must hear!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it because it's just like . Mario bros. I know it's free, but I would totally buy it if it wasn't!!!!
B009E3EY38|5.0|I love the performances and sound production quality of Celebration Day! The band's on fire and Jason Bonham did a incredible job. A must buy for the Zep fan I can highly recommend this.<br /><br /> To rehearse that long for this one show it's a shame they could not consider another world tour or at least a few more concerts. With Jason doing so well it was possible I could easily imagine NY, SF, Rio, Paris, Rom, Tokyo etc
B007TXN4TK|4.0|very good, really enjoy it yt yt yt y t y t y t ytytytyty ty t y t y t
B007XNAPNY|5.0|I saw them in concert September 2011 and I love the video because it took me back to the show I saw. There isn't any disappointing about this video. Just know that it isn't like &#34;Sing Blue Silver&#34; video with a the backstage and off stage interaction.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Son liked the look of the app, should help him be responsible.  I like graphic, but some of the work we had to wait to do because we had already did it before required.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I bought this for my wife during a $5 Amazon mp3 sale right after the film was released. We listen to three or four of the songs from time to time (including &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34; of course), but frankly the vocals aren't strong enough without the visuals to go with them. If you want great versions of Les Miserables music, then I'd recommend you look toward some of the other albums available. However, those will not give you the laughs that this album can provide through the Russell Crowe vocals. Always good for a chuckle.
B009NCM248|5.0|cant wait for vol.2 well worth the price!  Corey Taylor is amazing. i have to use eight more words  bye
B005VPRET4|5.0|I purchased this as a christmas gift. It is an excellent purchase. It was well liked, easy to assemble and she was so happy to get it. I guess Lego Friends is the gift for the year! Reasonable price also.
0440237688|2.0|Very disappointed with the condition of this book.  I chose this one because it said GOOD condition.  I wanted it for my son to follow along with in school and make his own notes.  The cover was beat up, the pages were ragged and just about every page had notes and marks on it.  The seller contacted me via email and discussed a possible return or replacement, and I never heard from them again.  Very disappointed.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The author makes a very convincing case for believing in the existance of heaven. It was a fast and easy read.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|An unseen twist to a fifty year old classic that kept your attention.  it was great for the whole family. i loved it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome; it has wonderful graphics and it is for all ages.<br /><br />I love the New York; Rio; how about Las Vegas.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The story was awesome but I love Percy Jackson and can not wait until the son of Neptune I loved Leo he was awesome and funny
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Post-apocalyptic stories were never an interest for me, unless it involved zombies.  While I was searching for the next book to read on Amazon, I stumbled across WOOL while reading reviews from a few other books that provided a spark.  I thought 5 stories for the price of one was a great bargain. So, I took a leap of faith and purchased WOOL.  Boy, was I totally satisfied!  Each story built upon the last, amping up the energy.  WOOL became my new favorite book.  I haven't read one better since I completed the Songs of Ice and Fire saga a year and a half ago.  Hugh Howey has quickly become my new favorite author alongside Stephen King, Joe Hill, George R.R. Martin, and Tom Clancy.  I've now devoured WOOL, SHIFT, and am eagerly anticipating DUST.  Luckily, I have bought the Molly Fyde series and the rest of Hugh's library to tide me over until DUST's release.  Thanks Hugh for writing such great material and feeding my mind.  I look forward to reading more about the Silo's and their inhabitants.  I want more Jules, Lukas, and Solo.  Plus, what really happened in Silo 40?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really like the game. Like a modern version o  temple run, and who doesn't lib  temple  run? Even better because you don  have  to tilt
B004LWZW8I|4.0|Good special effects and story line. There's something about Greek mythology that makes one think it could have been possible.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This was a very good book and I loved it. It is an awesome story that switches from action to comedy. Altogether I loved it and I can't wait to read the next book
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|A wonderful film about a time in rock n roll where greatness was created in the most unlikely place SOUND CITY STUDIOS, Van Nuys, CA.<br /><br />Watch PAST & PRESENT &#62;Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, Neil Young, Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, Rick Springfield, Foo fighters, Nirvana, and much much more.  BEST SURPRISE.... PAUL MCARTNEY!!!!!  Saw the Premier Film in San Diego at Hillcrest Cinemas, Purchased the DVD for My Kindle HD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This games is awesome and fun how the setting changes I so rate this a 5 stars and and it  needs more power hoverboard
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Great app just like using the calculator on the iPhone. I Use it all the time. Why pay for a calculator.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Challenging, but a whole lot of fun.  It's great being able to replay the landing after you've put in the work.  I wish it had missles to shoot just for fun, but it is all about take-offs and landings.  It would also be nice if you could see terrain at higher altitudes instead of overcast below.  I highly recommend this game if you like planes and flying.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is fun, but kind of hard to navigate at first. once you get the hang of it, it gets super easy. kind of repetitive. but fun nonetheless.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|I've only recently purchased Helidroid and have played it only a few times so far, but I can hardly wait to see my grandson to show him (he has a real RC toy chopper).  It isn't too hard in the beginning, and challenging enough that I foresee many enjoyable hours with it.  I haven't decided if I like gyro or &#34;joystick&#34; control better.  But a great game!
B007NCSQFO|4.0|How can you not like this little freak? She has got some skillz, and does a great job with her rhymes.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Season 2 is just getting into the intensity of the program.  Do yourself a favor and watch all 5 seasons. Great acting, story line and complex characters.
B00683JK9K|4.0|This is a wonderful time killer.<br />It would be nice to have more images to choose from (or better yet, a feature for loading your own images), but beggers can't be choosers!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Yah know, I can't quite understand why people thought this wasn't as &#34;good&#34; as The Dark Knight. It blew me away, and the plot line, acting, scenes, etc. were incredible! It's a bit of a different type of movie, but it's still got all the kick The Dark Knight delivered when it came out. The ultraviolet copy is actually very convenient, I can access it anytime now on my Galaxy Tab 2, and my Ipod touch. (it is available for offline viewing on those devices)
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved the whole movie concept... liked the interaction between the characters ... great movie overall .. glad to add it to my collection
0784011710|4.0|When I was in college, I took a couple of drama classes, not because I wanted to become an actor, but rather because I had to fulfill some \\"liberal arts\\" requirements.  Suffice it to say that I learned to appreciate one of the words in that expression; not so much the other.  You may guess which is which.  At any rate, one thing that I remember from those drama classes:  acting in film is different than acting on stage.  On film, it is OK, even desirable, for an actor to be subtle.  On stage, since the actors are farther away from their audience, subtlety is not always desirable.<br /><br />And this is why I've always been hit and miss, at least on film, with regards to Kevin Kline.  Personally, I find him to overexaggerate a bit, even to the point of being occaisonally borderline slapstick.  I'll bet he'd be fantastic though on stage, but I can't be sure as I've never seen him in a play.<br /><br />But here, Meryl Streep IS subtle, and she's fantastic.  It's hard to say which performance in her career is her best; you'd probably be splitting hairs.  But if you were to say, \\"Meryl Streep's greatest performance is in 'Sophie's Choice,'\\" you sure wouldn't get an argument from me.  She speaks at least three languages here -- I believe English, German and Polish(?) -- and her accent, of course, is perfect with all three.  (I've known people from that part of Europe who speak English, and Ms. Streep nails a European speaking English.  I also took German in college, and while I'll admit my German is poor, her's is better than mine will ever be.)<br /><br />I do have a little trouble whenever I see Peter MacNicol though.  I wasn't a fan of his character in \\"Ally McBeal\\" -- heck, I wasn't a fan of almost any of the characters in that TV series -- and unfortunately, I believe that Mr. MacNicol will always be associated with that role.  It's too bad, since overall, he's not a bad actor, and he does a very nice job here.<br /><br />I believe that there are several themes in this film:  Shame.  Loyalties.  But maybe most important, facades, as at least the Streep and Kline characters are not what they seem to be.  Each has his or her own secrets, and perhaps it's better for others to never learn those secrets.<br /><br />A pretty big recommendation by me.  Most likely, if you picked almost any other film to watch tonight over \\"Sophie's Choice,\\" you would be making the wrong choice.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|Look at the cast .... what could be nicer than watching them dance and strip .. nice bodies on those boys
0765325950|5.0|Seriously, if you made it to book 14, are you going to read a review?  Go buy the damn book and enjoy it, because i did and am glad my seventeen year journey has come to an end.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Fantastic writing I really enjoyed it! So descriptive, I felt like I was there throughout the whole book. I will recommend to many.
031606792X|4.0|Everyone has an opinion.  The characters are entertaining, the acting I would imagine  in a Saga  would be difficult. They keep it going and held our attention<br />I think a little more humor would have helped and the character \\"Charlie\\" should at some point been used more in the film. Great piece  of work.<br />Reese
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Excellente book!! Very well written, very easy to follow.<br />Mr. Matthews explain with the minimal detail all I wanted to know about wheiglifting for stay a little more bigger but leaner too!!<br />He also explain with a very detailed level and in a scientific but in a very easy understandable way for simple people like my, how to make a diet plan for all the phases of weightlifting and how to eat to stay healthy too.<br /><br />Once again, excellent work!!
6305313687|3.0|It's OK
B005ETANC2|5.0|i saw this when it first came out in the theaters when i was in grade school loved it then i still love it today it is a great movie to watch over and over again .
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This 6 DVD series about WWII is excellent among the best ever made and centers entirely about the horrific battles we had with the Japs in the Pacific War, You will be riveted with the true action portrayed in this series,<br />  It is one of the best made.........Buy it if you like reality and the truth about Infantryman and their lives in the war.<br /> It should be a Emmy award winner
B006MW3V6U|5.0|very action packed. love this series it'a  full of surprises for those of us who have preconceived ideas of how the family will react to their problems.
B000093FLA|2.0|This movie could not keep my attention<br />  It was OK at times but did not contain a great story line
B000V6738U|5.0|Good selection and 2 songs I never heard before are very good - my new favorite is Cousin Dupree.  Enjoy it
B00003CXWV|5.0|This is a great movie that depicts the true hazards of use Coke.<br />Very Graphic with No BS<br /> Depp does a fantastic gangster acting job telling the truth about this horrible drug
B005VTS4EY|1.0|Boring, unoriginal and not very interesting. My nephews and nieces who range from 4-18 all found it boring and stopped playing. Wouldn't even bother with my 2 yr old daughter.
6303029027|5.0|As I have said in many of my reviews Deniro is just the best. He is a classic actor who puts you in the movie with him<br /> Buy it you will love it
1591843065|3.0|One of the reasons this book appealed to me (before I read it) was that it seemed to be promoting simplicity.<br /><br />How to simplify things using pictures.<br /><br />Because of this I had expected a very simple book. I figured each chapter would be 1, 2, 3 -DONE.<br /><br />Not quite...<br /><br />I was reminded that many times authors are pushed to \\"fluff\\" a book up as much as possible before a big publishing house will except it. These things never bothered me until I started reading books that were written for kindle-- where no fluff was added.<br /><br />That being said, I never finished the book-- stopped about halfway through.<br /><br />Quite honestly I became bored.<br /><br />What I did read was well written and very thorough. If this is a topic that interests you, you'll probably enjoy your time with this book.
B00003CY5J|5.0|Deniro is a Classic like every movie he has made and will make, You can't lose it's a great Gangster Flick with Deniro's style . It's a winner and worth watching many times
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Great uplifting movie. Funny and inspirational. I would definitely recommend for any family. Family friendly film that even non-sports lovers will enjoy.
0439796636|5.0|I saw the movie, then read the book which was quite different from the movie, but both were very good in their own way.  Then we saw the stage play and that was terrific.  So glad that the author, Michael Morpurgo was able while  writing this as a children's story, could depict the feelings from the horses view. He shares the horrors of World War I In quite a different way. If you love horses, and history this is the book for you.
B007THA4FI|2.0|overall story line was too drawn out. Obviously being paid by the word. Should have read Killimg Kennedy. Maybe next time.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|I rarely take the time to review anything, I'm not sure how in the hell anybody could give this game 5 stars? You run around in a circle collecting notes, running from some guy with tentacles? This has to be the dumbest game I have EVER wasted time with. I wish I could have my 1.29$ back.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Realistic, dramatic, humorous modern Robinson Crusoe story. What a movie this would make! You will care about the characters. Bravo!
B00A17AD36|5.0|Awesome r n b album. The weekend is the new young gun on the scene.  Would like to hear more music with him and drake.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I am 62 years old and i loved the movie.  Fast paced and funny.  I think anyone<br />young or old would like it.
B000068CNX|5.0|Everybody loves Friends. Season two is when Rachel and Ross' relationship starts to blossom and it's awesome and lovely and maddening and frustrating, but you can't help but root for them. This show'll teach you about your own relationships with friends and lovers and family. Watch it!
B00151HZME|5.0|I can honestly say this is one of my favs of M83 album wise the only track they shouldn't have kept in the album would have to be #6  Up! Clean my Rockets what what!?!?! doesn't go with the albums mood at all in my opinion. So anyways hope you enjoy the cool rythems and synthesis awesomeness!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This is a great game! Reminds me of old school Mario. Definitely would recommend it if you like Mario you will like this.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Sterling hits the dub step violining better then any artist I know so I hope you enjoy it as much as i do!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You wont get bored with this game.<br />Once kids figure it out its fun for them to.Kinda hard to get gems, but at least it was free.
B004G8QHKO|5.0|There is so much this album just has going for it JUst go out and buy it and enjoy great tonese and indieish rock to boot!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was an interesting book; but a bit shallow. It seemed like an excuse to talk about the Obama mission and not the larger contest: Navy Seals.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Reminds me of the game at the carnival when I was a kid!  Kind of cheesy but fun!  Need more prizes out there at once!  :)
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This show keeps you on your toes, the writer must have a had a great imagination, its really interesting to watch.
B004EI2NM2|5.0|This movie was poetry from beginning to end. To that extent, some viewers might not appreciate the art house feel, which could leave it wrongly neglected if it is to be relegated as just a lesbian themed movie with consequently limited following. It deserves and caters to a far broader audience than this.<br /><br />As some reviewers have mentioned, the perpetual nakedness of the actors soon looses your attention as you become drawn into their world, intimate and compelling. I loved the stories both women wove, to entwine both each other and the viewer into curious and fascinating places. Every element of the movie is about weaving a fantasy, whether it is the fantasy of the possibilities between the two characters, the fantasies they weave about their lives, and the very fantasies of the audience (genders aside...or not), all backdropped by the wonderfully dream-like, art-filled room the whole encounter takes place in.<br /><br />Of course, there is also the expectation of a great sex scene in such a movie, and this one provides with poetic aplomb...twice. But this should be considered incidental to the entire journey through this magical realm.<br /><br />I saw this movie over a year ago and had so many more (now forgotten) ponderings about it that I wish I had written this review then. Definitely a favourite.
B005HSL626|5.0|DO NOT PAY FOR THIS GAME!!!  THIS FREE VERSION IS THE SAME AS THE ONE THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY MONEY FOR!!!<br /><br />This game is so much fun!!!  You use your finger as a Sword and slice as much fruit as you can!  There are different games for you to play.  Some games have a time limit and some games you get to slice fruit until you mess up!  VERY ADDICTIVE!!!!  You accumulate points at the end of each game, and then you use those points to get different weapons, backgrounds and upgrades!  Did I mention that this game is VERY ADDICTIVE!!!!  My Daughter and I compete against each other to see who can get the most points and we ALWAYS have a so much FUN playing this game!
B00712Y28Q|5.0|Check out youtube videos and photos, they do not lie - this model is absolutely great and it's going to sit on my desk at work for all to see. Love it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Excellent experience.  Great seller.  Shipped fast and product was as represented.  I would recommend seller and product to anyone wanting to read this.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|It is not surprising that this book continues over time to be a classic, enjoyed and re-read many times, as I* have re read it over and over... It was short but so well written-- not mushy but loving and portraying the lives of these dogs so that I found myself near tears many times... I always enjoy reading dog stories, especially when the dog's side of the story is as well told as this one!
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Roberts style takes you right along on the journey of his protagonist, draws you in from the onset and moves you in and out of each setting and interaction with each of his well-developed characters and their experiences with expert ease. His imagery and attention to detail is engaging and delightful. A self-published author my self, I consider this novel an invaluable tool as well.<br />Though we already know India to be a poverty stricken country, a new appreciation for America and our gradually recovering economy grips me as I read.
B005898CFI|4.0|Classic 60's adventure with The Duke? Fun to watch everybody chain smoking and drinking like fish. A time before political correctness convoluted our lives!
0743270754|5.0|A great read!<br />Goodwin's approach is subtle and nuanced and certainly delves deeper than any other Lincoln biography I've read.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I mean it's pretty interesting but it's a stretch.  I enjoyed it as a female as much as I have enjoyed the whole series well rounded out.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I kept thinking there was a point Ransom Riggs wanted to make other than telling a fantasy.  Maybe I missed it.
B002ZG999U|4.0|I haven't myself watched it but my husband loves it and enjoys the action scenes as well. Pretty lame plot but not
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love taking care of my horse when I play this game it feels like your actually there at the stable with your horse that's why I gave this game 5 stars because its fun and your really doing something like taking care of a horse.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Hilarious with all the cameos and the lines from other action movies were pretty awesome and played in well.  But since i haven't seen the first one I was a little lost.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy being able to sit on the conch and use my kindle to read and on facebook and chat without sitting of the computer.
B00498TQV8|1.0|I love art house and foreign movies, so it was a no brainer that I'd rent this.<br />It was boring.  And this Jennifer Lawrence person, is not a great actress.  She's nothing.<br />And now she is dressing like a vixen and trying to be a sex symbol.  She is no great beauty.<br />I see women more attractive than her working at Target.<br />Get real people, this movie and this actress are nothing to be impressed with.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is very nice and have various levels and allows you to rearrange to try again to finish the puzzle. I would recommend as well if you like it this game on the computer you will like it on the kindle
B00AG51V8E|5.0|I don't remember this movie being in the theaters but it was a good one well worth the buy. I love these cia type movies
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I've used this app to keep in touch w my fan all over the world sometimes I is the only Eaton ever get to hear from some of my loved ones
B0062NAVXA|2.0|I love cop movies and this one looked good. wasn't bad however I am not a beliver in churches and this movie was all about that. the characters preach to eachothers non stop and it just pisses me off when movies do that.
1250027624|5.0|Must love, love, love, Downtown Abbey.  Otherwise, may be boring.  Vignettes of all the characters but not in great detail.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Cause u can chose your own games and I just think it is awsome and I hope u enjoy this game as much as I do
1250006341|5.0|Good for background.  Must be rabid Downton Abbey fanatic to enjoy.  Others will find it draggy in parts and slow moving.
B0017V7GTY|5.0|this band i just happen to come across when they were on Dave letterman and they did &#34;the 59 sound&#34; and i lost track of them and them he put out the Elsie album with the horrible Crows, when heard him i know it was them so i had to do some looking to find them but i did and i'm so pleased i did. i love this Band.
B002SVBDYQ|5.0|This is a great album, the selection of bands on this soundtrack are some of my and my husband's favorites: Band of Skulls, Death Cab for Cutie, OK Go, The Killers and Grizzly Bear (who sounds a lot like Fleet Foxes). That's right, I'm not a teenager, I'm 35 and feel this is a great soundtrack.
B0000640SA|5.0|Memento the Two Disc limited Edition was exactly what we expected. Great special features and a very creative idea! Thank you!
1609611543|5.0|Bought the book, followed the program and results the first week?  Bloating & puffiness gone!  Have dumped the Gluten & all white stuff from my house.<br />Buy it & do it!
B00867GK26|5.0|I had this movie back when it first came out on DVD and then it dissapeared. Didnt know what happened to it? Now years later (now 2013) I thought I'd buy it for my niece since her birthday is coming up. Boy did I find a great deal! Got the 3 disc Blu-ray/DVD and it looks better than ever in HD(1080p)!!!!!!! Not to mention it was only $9 (used) but when I got it, it was like new! Looked like it wasnt even touched. And after all these years, its still a funny movie. Probably my favorite Disney/Pixar movie of all time!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show. I feel like I know all of the characters personally. The dialog is well written and the acting is very believable.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great Novel! Was worth to read, it is touching, controversial and at the same time loving. I enjoy reading it and couldn't stop. Every part of the book is interesting
B00APUQT7I|5.0|We have the first three movies, and we'll be getting this one, too, but the kids wanted to rent it while I find a good deal on it. Love that squirrel! I've started mixing all the movies together in my head now, but this series is one that at least the sequels are as good as or better than the movies that came before them.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book wouldn't let me put it down!  I stayed up too late and woke up too early thinking about it.  The characters were so engaging that I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next.  Heartbreaking and touching throughout.  Would make a great movie.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I absolutely love this series ... the background, the actors are sensational and their comraderie off screen certainly shows in their performances. Can hardly wait for season 5!!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook is far too intrusive for me, but a necessary evil at times.  This app is a poor substitute for using a computer as a social networking device.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|my 7-year-old did not enjoy this at all, you are constantly directed to buy extra &#34;bling&#34; which you get charged for, do not recommend at all
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really addicting game. It's really cool and I would recommend it to all of my friends. My friends all have it though! ;) You should really get this game and have some fun!
B005HSL626|4.0|fun game for all ages, even parents enjoyed this.  A good first game for younger kids as well as it is really easy to play.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Trust me when I say that the blu-ray transfer greatly enhances the overall experience of watching Lawrence of Arabia. If you don't already own this movie (and if you have a blu-ray player or a playstation 3), I would highly suggest buying the version that is currently on blu-ray because, trust me when I say this, the blu-ray version is to die for.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I bought this dvd for my daughter for Christmas since she had mentioned how much she enjoyed it at previous viewing. I saw it myself once and it was cute.  I would recommend.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Could not put this book down! The look into the German mind was fascinating as we have little to go on as to why they fought like they did. Does not explain everything, but gaves a peek at what drove them.
B0038P59A0|1.0|Movie Sherlock Holmes was boring. It was too slow. Just could nto get into it. Never finished it. Wasted money.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Love sports movies and always look foreward to a Clint Eastwood movie.  It lived up to all expectations. Great movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Ok there's a lot of good perkes to getting this game. Likewise,  I died about 7 times just looking at the nature(which reminded me of an air temple). Also,  it's more likely to get things like,  new pirsone, also new power ups, and stuff like that. But I gatta tell you ITS AWESOME
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is great for kids and adults because it challenges us and its really fun to play with someone you compete with
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|Love Bond movies.  This one dragged on and on and on and on. Casino Royale has been the best of the new generation Bond movies.  Everything since has been on a crappy decline.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Works well on kindle fire.  Would recommend.  Fun to play.  No lock ups.  Good graphics.  Nothing else to add to this.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Awesome collection but very bassy sounding. I have to change the tone controls on my receiver when listening to it.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|same issue as stated, find the graphics on the tiles annoying.  gives me a headache.  the game itself works great.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is one of the best temple runs ever. it's. just that when you turn you have to turn a lot or you die. but really its cool.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Works well.  My complaint is that you cannot pin from a website unless the website has a pinterest button.  Would like to have a pinterest button like you have on a regular computer to pin from the web.  Also does not let you &#34;move&#34; pins like from 1 board to another when you edit.  You have to re-pin to the new board and delete from the old board.  Too time consuming.  Other than that, great.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|A great book, I relate to it so much! In fact we are having a dance on Friday! Read it!
B006BDHAX0|3.0|Works great, but I hate the symbols on the tiles.  Gives me a headache, but it works well as a game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it is awesome I play almost every day it's more exciting then temple run and I just love it
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Lots of fun play time with this.  Works great, would recommend to anyone.  And it's free, holy crap!  Can't ask for more.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|I love the works of Jane Austen; it's amazing how very different her novels are from each other, and how different her heroines are. I'm often disappointed in films made of Austen's novels, but this version of Persuasion is true to the novel and takes great pains not to idealize the dress and social customs of the period. The film also refrains from glamorizing it's heroine too much, or from making her too worldly. Anne Eliot is played to perfection by actress Amanda Root. Anne has none of the quick-witted vivacity of my favorite Austen heroine, Elizabeth Bennet from Pride and Prejudice. On the other hand, she is not as soppy and slow as my least favorite heroine, Fanny Price (Mansfield Park). Anne is educated and sensible, yet she is sensitive and interested in romantic poetry. She is a quiet woman living a quiet life, nearly a decade since experiencing what women of her time called a &#34;disappointment in romance&#34; and giving up hope of ever marrying. The daughter of a baronet, her family has fallen onto hard times while her former lover has risen in a successful naval career; what would have been an &#34;imprudent&#34; match 8 years ago would actually have worked out to her advantage. The story of the novel and the movie is set against this back story. This film version of Persuasion is a quiet film, a very refreshing un-Hollywood type of movie. It is also a very artistic movie; the visual aspect is beautiful--especially the artistic shots of the sea side at Lyme--and the sound track is spare and beautiful--the music is solo piano, and the absence of orchestral richness adds to the serene quality. Also, birdsong plays a large part in the background sounds, and the main crisis of the film plays out against a sudden silence intensified by the call of a song bird. All of these small gestures add up to a beautiful, spare, unglamorized film of a beautiful, spare, unglamorized Austen novel, a quiet story, well-told.
B0086700CM|5.0|For a free download,  you can 't go wrong. Fast paced and challenging for an old cuss like me. The graphics are great and the Colorado are vivid
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|I'm very glad this game came to the Amazon app store.  I've had this for a while from the Google store, and have played on my phone, but I really wanted it for my Fires.  It's a bit small on the phone, but playable, it's very good on the older 7\\" Fire, and beautiful on the 8.9 HD Fire.  Knowing how much I liked it on the phone, I didn't mind re-purchasing the game and expansions for the Fire(s).<br /><br />There are some great reviews already posted so I won't go over all of the play, but yes, it can be difficult, and yes, the randomness of the rolls can be frustrating at times, but so can the board version. . . and after all, who among us couldn't use a good thrashing by a computer AI from time to time?<br /><br />I will say that I haven't had any trouble with the game crashing completely, although on my older Fire it does occasionally stall a bit on startup.  I just choose the 'wait' option and it doesn't take long for it finish starting.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I like Emma, and I was happy to find the BBC version.  I enjoyed the cast.  I'd buy this again.
B004X0XA82|5.0|It's very smooth, soothing Fleet Foxes music. Always enjoyed their music though. 8 more words required. soo i write ten.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|there r some game that require a lot of speed and thought I like this game. it makes me think. if u want to get this game go and download it
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app!  Easy to see.  Easy to use.  Was sick had to get some work done at home.  Why pull out a big adding machine.  Just bookmarks the book I was reading and open up this app.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Awesome entertainment from start to finish. Well acted and captivating.  The actors were very believable and I was into the story from the beginning.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for lots of action and a good story line.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have to st this is one of the best books I have ever read I suggest this book to anyone 12 and up!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Wow wow wow wow  Wow Wow wow wow wow wow  GOLD horse game and I like it I do not just like it I love it
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Lots of fun to play and hard to put down.  It is a good game to increase mental flexibility and processing.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It is a very easy way to pass the time. The only issue I have with it is it just gets so repetitive but overall I enjoyed it
B000L53D4O|1.0|I think we bought this too late, our daughter has had no interest in playing with this, would like to return it but do not have original packaging...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book!  Spoiler alert.<br />  In my opinion, this is the best book of the series.  All the unexpected twists and turns make this the best book I've ever read.  My favorite part was when (SERIOUS SPOILER ALERT I'M NOT KIDDING) Katniss killed President Coin.  My least favorite part was when (ANOTHER SERIOUS SPOILER ALERT) Finnick died.  BEST BOOK EVAHHHHH!!  (Although it's no joking matter)<br />XP
B005ZHBA9I|2.0|Was looking to purchase the soundtrack, accidentally bought the score, returned it to purchase what was intended.<br />Will be more careful next time
157421327X|4.0|Great book for this wanting to learn the basics of the art of zen tangling. Well worth the inexpensive cost!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Everyone, married and Single should read this book. Married couples should read it together. I also recommend the Five Love Languages of Children!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Es una de las mejores trilogias que han salido a la venta. El precio es muy bueno. En los discos extras encuentras una serie de escenas, entrevistas y otras cosas que hacen una muy buena experiencia de compra.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is amazing!! Woooooooo! Amazing amazing amazing amazing.. .one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve booyakkaaa
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is a great product. Definitely good protection for my kindle and the stand option is neat. I also really like the power save feature so I can just close the cover when I am done.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was very exciting with so many twists and turns.  It kept the pages turning and was fascinating to the last page.
0786948523|5.0|Any book of monsters will be limited by space, but I think those that were included are useful starting points for building encounters. I enjoy sitting with an actual book in my hand and going through it to ponder my next battle.
B0099114WO|2.0|We were going to watch this movie with relatives, the preview looked funny. It was a lot of sex talk<br />in it, and it wasn't very funny.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is an unusual book. Well written with unexpected plot twists. More character study than mystery, it will will keep your attention until the end.
0345529057|5.0|I am starting book 3 and have not found the defects described re missing pages.Long series,not something to keep renewing from the library so I bought it.No complaints so far,now I don't have to finish in a hurry.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We love the program.  It popular with many people we know, all of which highly recommended we start with the first series and view all of the episodes.  I'm glad we did.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|My daugter is 5 and loves pets! She loves this game!<br />My opinion is that there could be more levels, after about 20 minutes she has already taken care of all the animals and then the sequences start over.  The animals are the same and so are the procedures. I was looking for a game that was like Pet Pals 2 on her Leapster.
B002B554TO|4.0|Right off the bat I gave it four stars after my first listen.  I expect it will rise as I play the album more.  Vinyl is the way to go.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best you really want it. it was normal now its rio but its still the same
B000CNFC76|4.0|This movie will not change your life, but unless you just HATE golf, you probably won't come away wishing for your two hours back, either.<br />I'll admit I checked this movie out because of the lead actor, but the film itself is fine. No doubt this is the slightly Disneyfied version of a real historical event, but that's to be expected.<br /><br />Here's the bottom line: If you are a fan of that genre of feel-good,overcoming-adversity-and-learning-valuable-things-about-yourself-in-the-process sports film, you will enjoy this film. If you hated 'Remember The Titans', 'Hoosiers', &#34;The Blind Side',etc...well, give this one a miss.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What can I say like so many reviews, I fell in with this book!!! And every Character! Some how. When reading I fealt at one with Ana And Christian, like I was part of the story. I was happy when Ana was happy,Sad when she's sad etc.. Even cried :) It took me three days to read this book and in those 3 days that's all I did, was read. I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN, it was amazing. An amazing love story about two people that are so different, but try to make it work. I cannot wait to read B<br />Book # 2 and 3
B006PAZMMK|5.0|This album definitely gets you pump and keeps you there, especially with a 15\\" sub in the trunk. Great bass drops worth the couple of bucks
1558908382|5.0|Great movie makes me laugh everytime I watch it. I like it so much that I bought it for my brother for Christmas.  I don't know if he's watched it yet but I'm sure he'll like it.
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|This was a really good movie! I did not expect it to be so good! It really kept us interested right up to the end!
B003L77G8I|5.0|My brother loves the series.  He did'nt have the 6th season he was very happy with the DVD. Thanks for the quick turnaround time.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|I really don't know if I can add much to what's already been said about this, BluRay is about LIVE.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a nice game and additive. The good thing is that it is free. Now it's in a world tour
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book rivals the Twilight Trilogy with suspense and action.  Great characters and story line.  Hope this series continues. Thanks
0425252868|5.0|Not since reading another classic, Das Boot, have I been so compelled by 'the other side' of the war, or so moved to tears as I was with another classic, Ernest K. Gann's wonderful book, 'Fate is the Hunter'. I ordered this book with decent expectations; a good story and it is, but completely surprised that it was written, researched and fantastically delivered by a team of folks that are at least ten years younger than me.  I am fourty three, and the gentlemen involved in this story could have been my grandparents.  I implore any and all to read this book, it truly is wonderful, heart wrenching at times, but well worth the experience!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|For those that enjoy a good love story - Nicholas Sparks will always deliver. The mystery & action of this book will keep you turning those pages! Great read!

B005CW5E3E|4.0|July 2012 I had the opportunity to once again see Johnny Winter in concert. This was my second time as I saw him back in the late 80s.<br /><br />Many of the songs from his show came from the Roots CD.  The CD showcases a different artists on each song. Example, Vince Gill performs on \\"Maybelline\\" and brother Edgar Winter \\"Honky Tonk\\". Then there's Winters guitarist \\"Paul Nelson\\" doing a great job on \\"Short Fat Annie\\". Every song has a special guest.<br /><br />The song selection is excellent. Johnny's vocals are very good. As a matter of fact, I can now understand the lyrics he sings as opposed to decades ago (I'm a guitarist and figuring out his lyrics pre-internet and pre-tab books was very difficult).<br /><br />On the down side, his guitar skills are not what they used too be, but, they're not bad either. Only a song here or there can you hear the current JW as opposed to the blazing young JW.<br /><br />This CD is well worth a purchase. Paul Nelson has done a wonderful job producing this CD and getting JW back up to par, health and guitar wise. Here's hoping Johnny will continue to produce more albums in the future.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander's story is astounding and his telling of his story is truly convincing. His depiction of his experiences on the Other Side, and their meaning for all of us, resonated with me deep within my own soul. I have to say, I can't get his message out of my mind. The knowledge that we are unconditionally loved is so powerful and life-changing.<br /><br />As an academic neurosurgeon, Dr. Alexander was able to clearly articulate, more cogently than the average person, why his NDE was genuine evidence of the survival of consciousness outside of the localized brain and body. I am happy that such an educated, experienced scientist and physician is now among the champions of this perspective, and I know he will convince many people to look beyond material reality for purpose and meaning in life.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game  is probaly going to be awsome i took the chance to download thin play ;) take the chance like me.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I like these little romance novels once in a while.  This one has an unusual twist.  It starts out with a woman waking up in bed married, with no knowledge of what happened and how she got there.  She slowly learns the story, and I won't give away too much about what happens next.

B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I had wanted to see this movie since the theater release after seeing the previews. The storyline was interesting, and good acting. I was disappointed that it was not more of a comedy, some parts were sad.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book for the series i wasn't disapointed at all. i liked the realistic ending she didn't powder up the situation it was a believable ending.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Thrilling- couldn't put down  great ending.would recommend reading if you like suspense, romance and what could have.been a true story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recomend this series to anyone who enjoys a fast paced easy read. its well written and is filled with great characters to fall in love with.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I thought this was a very intriguing trilogy.  The characters were very interesting but I was expecting an ending very different from what it was.  Not disappointing just thought it might go a different way.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I love this story! He is an amazing author tons of details you can imagine everything perfectly as he describes it.

B0084U0IEG|2.0|Here's a book that is grindingly slow for the first half.  Had it not been chosen by my book club I doubt I would have<br />persevered to the end.  It is about a project of the Mi5 codenamed Sweet Tooth.  Decidedly unlikeable main character is a bland victim of her beauty and the various beasts of a male dominated world.  No victory here.

0393316041|4.0|A fascinating foray into the fun yet formidable physics of Mr. Feynman.  Actually, this book is less about physics and more about the life of Nobel Prize Laureate, Richard Feynman.  (Richard just rolled over in his grave; if you want to know why -- read this book!)  Once I adjusted  my expectations from education to entertainment, I absorbed every word.  He was always interesting, at times very entertaining and despite his obvious genius he had an utter lack of pretentiousness and conceit that I previously assumed afflicted all venerated scientists.  I left this book wishing for more, and feeling inspired to pursue my own adventures in curiosity.  What could I achieve if, like Richard, I abandoned my Western culture imperative of accomplishment through suffering and played with my talents in ways I felt was fun?

B00ABXA1HI|3.0|This app is well designed with very intuitive menus, controls, etc.  I am not pleased that it requires me to pay for a subscription for my Motorola Atrix AND my Asus Nexus.  One monthly fee should be sufficient to allow remote access from both devices.  This keeps me from giving it 5 stars.

B0002W19KQ|4.0|This 4-part, 6-hour TV adaptation of Les Misérables has a lot going for it. First of all, the length; it's the longest adaptation of the novel (arguably the greatest French novel of the 19th century, and one of the longest). It has a large cast, with some excellent actors. Unfortunately, it's filmed in the typically bland style of French TV, and the direction is nothing more than workmanlike. When I first started watching this, I was almost tempted to give up after 15 minutes. But it got better over time. (I had similar thoughts when watching a recent film based on Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu by the same director, also made for TV.)<br /><br />Gérard Depardieu plays Jean Valjean, and, for me, he doesn't quite fit the part. He's too big, too brash to have the subtlety the character needs. On the other hand, John Malkovich is an excellent Javert, though his dispassionate portrayal of the character can be seen as a bit too distant. Christian Clavier is Thénardier, and seems a bit out of place. A comic actor, generally in simple comedies, his persona doesn't quite fit. However, Virginie Ledoyen is nearly perfect as Cosette, with her innocence and fetching smiles.<br /><br />But the main problem here is that everything is too clean, too heroic and idealized. Hugo did not write a novel where everyone is washed and shaved; he wrote about \\"les misérables,\\" the downtrodded, the poor. These are people who suffer, not people with clean shirts all the time. In this adaptation, everything is just a bit too perfect. (It's totally different from the recent adaptation of the musical, which, for all its faults, does show the characters in squalor.)<br /><br />The good points here are the length: at 6 hours, you do get much more of the story - and it is a complex story - than other versions. But the mediocre direction, so-so acting, and overall approach make it lose points. It's worth watching if you're a fan of the novel.<br /><br />By the way, the Amazon product information suggests that this is one DVD, 80 minutes long. I'm not sure if that's the case, or if this is the full 4-disc version.

B008220DGE|5.0|this is a very sad, very true movie.  even though it has major talent abounding in it, it is an art film. i doubt it will appeal to many aside from the art house crowd.  fortunately, i am such a person. there is at once a lot and a little going on in this film.  but if you pare it down to its core, it is our desperate need to find meaning in living a life in a world which may have no meaning, basically, we all have a choice.  we can go the meaningless route, which is what the joaquin phoenix character represents, or we can carve meaning out any way feasible and sell it to ourselves and even others. (such people are rarely convinced by only converting themselves to a specific meaning). hence we get THE MASTER, as played by PS Hoffman, which is based on LRon Hubbard, the author of DIANETICS and founder of Scientology.<br /><br />this is a curious blend of belief.  it is part psychiatry, part religion, part science fiction, part regression therapy and a whole heck of a lot of control. Hoffman's Lester Dodd is not a con man.  It would be a far different movie if he were.  He has a need to find a belief, follow it and convert others to it. he is abaolutely committed to his work, especially the writings of it.<br /><br />jonny greenwood's music plays throughout and really heightens the weirdness of the whole movement,<br /><br />do the religion and its adherents seem abnormally weird? a little but one has to remember that the underpinnings of all organized religion require some out of this physical world leap of belief. we get into the past lives going back trillions of years but the alien aspect of scientology is mentioned only by a sceptic who says earth hasn't been around that long.  that's where scientology gets into the alien Thetans who its adherents need to expell, which reminds me of catholic exorcism, however, writer-director paul thomas anderson is content just to leave that aspect at the trillions of years comment.<br /><br />phoenix, hoffman, and the actor who plays hoffman's wife are all up for the oscar.  phoenix turns in an especially powerful performance of a tortured soul adrift (ironically we picking him up in the closing days of WWII as a sailor in the Navy.)<br /><br />this is a thinking person's movie.  if you are looking for an evening's entertainment, there is NO element of escapist relief to this film, which is rather the point of the whole thing.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a fun game that will make you crazy.  The more you  play the more addicted you become.  The sound is crazy too but keeps you trying with each challange.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|The adaptor plug part will not fit into my car without some serious force. Never had a problem with any of my past adaptors, so this must be an issue with the Griffin one. After jamming it into my truck's outlet, I discovered the lightning adaptor will not fit into my phone while the case is on. I have a very slim, basic rocketfish $15 case that is not bulky at all but the sides of the Griffin adaptor are too large. Never got to see if the charging function actually works or not.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the trilogy. It was very sexy and funny and was a great read. Couldn't put it down.
B005IQZB14|5.0|From the first page, I was worried that Cheryl Strayed's memoir would be too verbiose for my taste. But I found her writing style both straightforward, but also beautifully worded and thought-provoking. It was simple, but made me stop at times, stare off into space and reflect on what I had just read. The first part of the book, detailing her mother (not to spoil anything), was incredibly poignant for me, as I'm very close to my mother. I was almost worried I would start crying a bit at work. I did have to text my mom and tell her I loved her. I sympathize a lot with Cheryl, feel we have a lot in common. A great book, that did make me want to go out and do something slightly bigger than myself.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|Movie was great. DVD had no scratches and played fine. Arrived on time and I am happy with this purchase
B008FPOIT6|3.0|Good story, kind of drags in places with technical information. Characters are likable and charming. Interesting enough, worth a look.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I laughed, cried, became angry and was inspired throughout this novel. The characters that Moyes creates are realistic, they are human (even Patrick who is an obsessive self centered triathlete freak - spot on, I would know first hand having had dated one). This novel was captivating from starting to end. I couldn't put it down (I had finished it within 12 hours off and on, trying to stop but had to keep going).<br /><br />Easy read, no boring leads. This kept me entertained and wanting to know more and more about Lou and Will.  Even in the small amount of time they had become to know each other, they reached a level of understanding between the two of them as if they had known each other for years.<br /><br />Highly recommended, definitely in my top favorite novels of all time.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Very different from the Harry Potter stories. Nicely written. You feel for the characters and find yourself hoping for a happy ending. Worth reading.
B008WHTFL8|5.0|The Darkness is one of my favorite bands in the world.  I was ecstatic when they released a new album.  They did not disappoint with Hot Cakes.  Still irreverent and fun with a great beat.  I love to dance around to this album singing on the top of my lungs.

B003WUYRGI|5.0|it was very informal (lol) for an ereader dictionary. i havent seen any other ereader dictionaries, but im sure this one is tops.

B001GXNBJW|4.0|Love the blues, rock combination of sounds they produce. You can't go wrong with The Black Keys! Simply amazing group!
0316224588|3.0|Well, I'll agree wth most reviewers and applaud the return of Rankin's John Rebus character. Very nice to drag the old geezer (okay, not so old, but getting up there in years) out of retirement for another baffling bunch of murders. But unlike waht some are saying, this is not quite the return to form I hoped for, certainly not the top form Rankin has shown us in the past. The story starts off a bit slow but after picking up steam --- and accumulating more characters and suspects --- becomes one of those impossible to put down Rankin novels. That said, I thought the ending was very weak; both anti-climactic and troubling. I really expected a bigger bang, or at least something less morally ambiguous. I also did not like the inclusion of Malcolm Fox from Rankin's non-Rebus \\"The Complaints\\" series (okay, only 2 books, but that almost counts for a series) in the sub-plot of this novel. I felt that this \\"complaints\\" angle was both awkward and poorly executed. Instead of being a somewhat likeable protagonist in one book, Rankin turns Fox into an obsessed, annoying cop with a bizarre grudge. If anything, his presence in this book was distracting, if not annoying.<br /><br />But one of things that I love about Rankin novels, the musical references, are in abundance once again. Starting with the mention of the late great Jackie Leven in the opening pages (which has relevance to this book's title) to the many James Page-inspired Led Zeppelin song titles that pepper the pages, and many other album and artist/band name droppings, this evokes many smiles for my music-loving soul. In addition to the music bits (and yes, Rebus is still playing discs on a turntable!), this novel has many other good suspenseful and funny moments. I think most Rankin/Rebus fans will be quite pleased with this new installment. But for my tastes, this one won't rank with his best efforts.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is so lifelike the competiton is fun its like having your own ohorse you must try this you feed your horse give him treats clean and train him then you get to compete
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love sleeping to the ocean waves. right before I got this ap I wasn't sleeping well for several nights in a row. I used this and I slept like a rock. it doesn't use very much battey either and it also can turn our device into a clock. there are new noises you can download as well.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I think it is okay because I earned 1,990 and it went to 30 coins!I don't recommend it but ally of people so buy it if you want.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was my favorite book of the three.  There were parts that were so intense I was holding my head in my hands reading as fast as I could!
B003ES5ZPK|2.0|It stills puts a picture up on the screen, but its a lower resolution.  Maybe I got a bad one :(
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good read for Keeping personal relations and quirks, just plain craziness, in true life perspective.<br />If you like a love story with twists, it's here.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|It was a little slow to start but it deffinitely picks up in the middle. I loved it! &#60;3 cant wait for the FINAL BOOK

B003Z0BWT0|5.0|A well thought out and written book, I have really enjoyed reading this series and will have to read it again before the final one is released
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I was intrigued by the one-liner intro for the movie, and up to then, hadn't heard about this film or singer/songwriter. I decided to rent it on a whim. VERY glad I did! Excellent and very touching story of a humble man. Don't want to give away any of the interesting bio. I highly recommend this; hope it gets the Academy Award for Best Documentary!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Bought this on my kindle at the airport for something to entertain me on the flight.  Couldn't put it down until I finished it.  Very cool imaginative storyline and perspective on zombie apocalypse.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|um I think its a really good game depending on the person playing it but it has its flaws its not exactly perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000YPUFA6|4.0|Enjoy the series, this was better than the second one. I like that it takes you back and gives you an idea incase you forgot the previous movies, or just haven't seen them.
1451695195|3.0|I believe in near death experiences, and have read a few books on the subject. Dr. Alexander's book is just too technical and difficult for me. I can see where scientists and other doctors might get a lot out of it, but I didn't. I'm much more interested in feelings, emotions and experiences than scientific facts and speculation.
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|I've been a fan of JG for a loooong time and own all of his CDs, been to his concerts multiple times, yada yada yada.  The following are a few words that I would use to describe this album: slow, disappointing, forgettable, and weak.  This is almost elevator music in my opinion!  He never lets his vocals fly like he did in previous albums.  This one cannot compare to Awake or Illuminations, not by a long shot.<br /><br />Unfortunately not my cup of tea this time around.
B009P12GQ6|5.0|I had been back in the states for a couple of years when this came out. A great LP at the time. Proper storage alone was always a problem. Plus not scratching the LP when out of it's protective sleeve. Now I can listen to it anywhere ! Can't wait to download all my favorite albums from the past. Just wish I could find the old &#34;McKendre Spring 3&#34; album.
B000ID37RM|5.0|My son has to read this book for his English class.  He was not thrilled about reading a book that he didn't understand or was interested in.  We rented the movie and he loved it.  He is reading the book and I don't have to pest him to keep reading for his class.  Watching the movie helped him understand what the book was about and he is learning the difference between watching a movie and reading the book and how the book always has much more detail than a movie.
B008745B32|1.0|I was forced to buy this by clicking on kindle unconsciously ...it's t o o b a d<br />kindle is tricky
B002CAWNEM|4.0|Had seen on tv before and remembered it was a good watch so decided to order the dvd.  Watched it again and yes it was a good watch.
B009GJCFL8|5.0|I have been a fan of Asia since the beginning. As a fan of the band members individually, I had to give them a listen. They still don't disappoint.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I usually don't read science fiction, but this was fairly believable.  I was disappointed when I couldn't find any other books by this author.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Got a few weak points bu the chemistry of the cast is second to none.  A nice clean reboot into a series much in need of just such.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This CD was purchased as a &#34;Christmas&#34; present due for release December 19. Received Feb 7. I'm sure it's fine but now have to send it to the person whom it was for...a bit late.. thanks

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I was so compelled the whole time! I fell head over heels in love with the story! Keep it up Nicholas! This is why you are my favorite author!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This third really wraps the whys of the two main characters in a bow. Great read, will recommend to all of my friends. Definitely worthy of a 5  star rating
037571457X|5.0|The book was long and full of different details but it was good. I was in good condition and served its purpose of a book report well.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie in the theaters and I was pleasantly surprised. It was very captivating and kept my intense interest throughout.
B008ENNXQI|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie. I am a Julia Roberts fan but, this movie was pretty terrible. If you want to see a Snow White movie you should not watch this and watch Snow White and the Huntsman.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|The story starting off Robert (husband) at hotel under water and you get a phone call. So you go after him and that's where the adventures begin... there ugly and mean creatures trying to get you.<br /><br />Now it's an hidden object game you hunt, grab, and walk around a lot . Talking of the characters were cute, after awhile  bug me and reason for that is so cartoonist...hello c.g.i should been singing.... game had perfect hint  button tells you where to go and the screen sparkles when you need to do something. Try the game if you like an challenge and good story. Enjoy fun awaits!
B0002ZXCY4|5.0|I have just started listening to Ayreon, and from this album alone I think that this man is a awesome guy, the wide variety of vocalists is truely amazing as well as the use of metal influences along with the electronic influences worked suprisingly well. The CD itself was shipped brand new and works perfectly when downloaded. If you're interested in buying this album, I would fully recommend it.
B00683JK9K|5.0|Keep me relaxing from work and stress.  I played with different level and times goes fast.<br />Suggest for people who are very busy.
B003H4RDZQ|1.0|I was mildly enjoying this book when just a few pages in David Sedaris got REALLY nasty and made fun of a group of mentally disabled people. He didn't simply use the term \\"retarded\\", he flat out made fun of a group of mentally challenged people he met when he was working as an elf at Macy's. I don't care if the story is made up and posing as real. He nastily described and made fun of how they look and act. Yuck. I don't need to waste time on an author who is downright cruel. I'll never read another David Sedaris book again.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Love the show and the music from it.  These are some really talented artists and I hope they will be coming out with more cd's from the show
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The episodes and story and cast are wonderful. But one of our discs was very garbled and conversations between the characters was impossible to understand. I was very disappointed in that, as the script is so good.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another good one by Mr Grisham. Enjoyed it. He never seems to dissapoint. Looking forward to the next one.  Oh yeah.
0307949435|2.0|This book was recommended by my doctor.  I didn't care much for it and would not recommend it myself.  In fact I gave away my copy after I read it.

0470449748|5.0|If you are going to take GMAT and have only 30-40 days to study only 3 hours per day, but no more, Official Guide for GMAT Review is the book you should follow. You can supplement your studies with two other books by the same publisher if you have 15 more days to study 3 hours per day for each of the following books: [[ASIN:0470449756 The Official Guide for GMAT Verbal Review, 2nd Edition]] & [[ASIN:0470747447 GMAT Quantitative Review]]<br /><br />There are bunch of other guides that can help you prepare for GMAT; however, above are the most comprehensive ones that busy professionals should follow, I believe. If you have more time than stated herein above however, I strongly recommend you to start studying with one of the other publications available. This will enable you to get accustomed to the test, GMAT, before using those three valuable products. It may also be better to look for the most recent editions of these books as the published revise them annually, if I am not mistaken.
B002FID3M2|5.0|This is such a classic.  I bought this for my 24 year old daughter and she loved it and then I borrowed it and I loved it!!
B006X5L6VS|2.0|Hard to understand how to set up and use. Labels do not stay on long enough to appreciate the sky. Had a free version that ran circles around this one.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|What can I say in a review that people who are going to buy this don't already know???  It's an AWESOME movie!!  LoVe LoVe LoVe it!!
B004EFYZ1C|3.0|With no instructions on how to set up and just touching the scene changes the settings. I was highly disappointed with this product.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent series.  It's worth buying the season 1 & 2 DVD if you have not seen the whole program.  Not to miss.
0767836324|5.0|I was impressed with this item the moment it arrived, and upon me opening the package it was wrapped well and in the best condition thank you so much
B007QUUJMG|3.0|I found the contence of this book to be sad. It talks about drugs and smoking and abortion as if thoes things  are ok. Books reach a wide ray of people and their contence can afect peoples thinking. Its sad what young people have to deal with today,<br />I did like the way the book was written in letter form, it felt like you were reading over someones shoudler and that is always fun to do. The ending made you sit up and think about the main character its good he had supportive parents and friends, You know he was going to be o.k
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game. It is a awesome game. It is easy to operate.<br /><br />The game is easy and fun.
0316228532|5.0|The plot revolves around an important man's death, which sets off a series of events that prove cataclysmic for all the people involved. But essentially it's about the seedy underbelly of a seemingly idyllic small town in rural England. Everyone knows each other's business, and the people are all pretty dysfunctional. The characters are all hopelessly flawed and each is struggling with untold amounts of baggage and difficulty. There are at least a dozen protagonists, yet all are intricately developed and all but a couple are extremely sympathetic. I loved it because all of the subplots are delicately interwoven, the characters are round and complex, the writing is skillful, and the harsh reality of it all was somehow immensely satisfying to lose myself in for awhile. There's some vulgarity in it, and it's probably not for everyone, but I absolutely loved it. (By the way, not that it matters, but I'm also a HUGE fan of the Harry Potter series, and while some people are strangely bothered by Rowling's venture into adult lit., I can't help but feeling that it's silly to be bothered by that - there are TONS of authors who write both adult and kid lit.  It's an impressive author who can do both as successfully as Rowling has done).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game ,every time I get on to my kindle l want to play it.I highly suggest this game
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun game. Keeps me trying again. But because its so addictive my real life duties are falling to the wayside. Dishes and laundry are piling up.  The goldfish died. And the husband is getting cobwebs.  Kidding. Or am I?<br />At any rate it's a cute little game that I love to hate and keep coming back to. And its challenging too. My high score is laughable. But someday I'll take home the trophy!<br />There is a trophy for this,  right??? RIGHT? !?!
0307895475|5.0|Totaly met my expectations. Was really helpfull especially time when I was stuck. Showed how much there really is to the game of skyrim.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Very inspiring I loved the book. If you have a chance to read it you should.<br />I loved the book
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I enjoyed this creative work of science fiction realism notwithstanding its many typos and occasional missing text. I gave it 4 stars because of editing but it deserves 5 stars for its outstanding imagining of how a modern Robinson Crusoe survives alone on Mars using uber MacGyver skills. if you enjoy reading how things get done such as how to grow potatoes on Mars, how to make water, how to right an overturned Rover, how to fabricate all kinds of things from available materials, all while trying to exist in an airless subzero atmosphere, you will be impressed with Mark Watney's pragmatic resolution of each problem he faces. Using the device of his daily log you get all his thinking and planning as he faces each new challenge, most of which seem insoluble, but which he manages to overcome, often by the skin of his teeth. This book is a believable exploration of the best in the human spirit that enables survival against all odds.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|I picked this up at Target for under 30 dollars and that is about the right price for this toy. I might have spent a little bit more because it IS durable, super cute and sturdy but be aware if the price gets too crazy, this item probably ISN'T worth over 50 dollars. The set has what is pictured here and looks exactly like the photos online. What you see is what you get and I consider that a good thing. When I bought the toy in person, the box was sealed so I couldn't see anything but the doll. I wasn't disappointed with the contents because the furniture is good quality, though I did expect more stuff to be inside.<br /><br />The addition of Clawdeen certainly bumps up the value of this set a lot. Her style is a little tamer in this version of the doll and though her outfit is understated here (understated for Clawdeen anyway) and she still looks very pretty and chic. I like the striped purple dress, the gold belt and jewelry and sensible \\"work\\" shoes...which to Clawdeen translates to high-heel sneakers. Her hair texture is a straighter style that is easy to manage and came out of the package gorgeous. She also has a natural looking hair color here.<br /><br />I don't have that many Clawdeen dolls but this particular one really grew on me and she has been the star of a few photo shoots. In a way, I like her better than the flashier Clawdeen dolls. Her makeup is glamorous with shimmery lavender eye-shadow and this looks a lot softer and more delicate and really brings out the beauty of the doll. Clawdeen usually has a wild and freaky-fab style but the good thing about this doll is that her makeup and hair are versatile and look good with many other outfits. You can dress this doll up or dress her down and that isn't so much of an option with some of the other \\"wild\\" Clawdeen dolls.<br /><br />I am a grownup collector and I make doll clothing, furniture, houses and doll scenes as a hobby. It always helps to have extra furniture and pieces. This set was a great addition. The furniture is made from hard plastic and doesn't fall apart. The coffin coffee table and the counter/cash register parts need some assembly, especially if it is for a small child. The set has some accessories but if you want a complete play-scene you probably will end up adding a few things like I did.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this set (though I won't remove a star for it because I liked it so much) was that the \\"Coffin Bean\\" only came with furniture and NO actual building. This is okay because the box and online photos are honest but it would have been nice to have a background for a coffee shop style setting. I did have to make a background to make it look more like a coffee shop. Oh well...it IS a cute set and it was worth the price I paid. The furniture looks creepy-cute and I got some fun pictures. I also have used the furniture in other spooky doll scenes so I have gotten a lot of use out of it. If you can find this item for a good price, it IS very good quality and is 100% worth the money!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|my daughter and I love this game! we enjoy playing together and doing all of the challenges... my only complaint is the price of gems and how many you need to get things.. it would be nice if they made them easier to get or if you received more throughout the game...

1585673927|3.0|This is a book about Jeeves the butler and his master and often friends of his boss.  It is a series of stories and i enjoyed the first one, didn't mind the second, and then when the stories kept repeating on the same theme, i.e. a bloke receiving money from his rich uncle / auntie and having to explain or do something associated with his future dependance on this income i just got over it.  the stories are well written and Jeeves is an intelligent character but i personally just found it trying when the stories read the same.  A different reader would no doubt enjoy it so I wouldn't read this criticism as a reason not to try it out.  It just wasn't for me.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|\\"Life\\" David Attenborough Version, Bluray:<br /><br />This one is truly amazing, a masterpiece. People always compare between \\"Planet Earth\\" (which also has close to a 5 star rating) and \\"Life\\". It is actually difficult to compare between \\"Planet Earth\\" and this one, but my vote goes to \\"Life\\". Planet Earth is also an excellent series but it moves too fast between one continent to another without going into the details. To sum up \\"Planet Earth is Jack of all Trades but Master of None\\". But, then again it is my personal opinion. I have both the series and they both are truly amazing. Great work from BBC.<br /><br />Coming back to \\"Life\\", please please buy the David Attenborough version. Trust me I have both versions and it is a total different experience listening to Attenborough version. Oprah narration is not very bad, but it is meant for kids- they will love it and it is cheaper too. If you don't want it for your kids and are seriously looking for some knowledge, go for the Attenborough version. It is deep and totally worth the extra money. I don't hate Oprah, but then I never expected anything great from her. It is totally Discovery's fault. Discovery already has spoiled many such series with narration from actors. I bet USA has a lot of good naturalist and scientists, why not use them. \\"Please Discovery, leave science for scientists\\".<br />Also, Attenborough version is about 100 min longer and is entirely in 1080p (even the special features are in high definition) whereas the Discovery-Oprah version is in 1080i and no high definition for special features.<br /><br />Another thing, Life by David Attenborough is much cheaper in United Kingdom (at least when I first wrote the review), but do not buy it from there. I already did this mistake but amazon.uk was kind enough to refund my money. It has nothing to do with the region coding, but the UK version is coded in 50i or 50Hz which will not play in most of the US bluray players (US players need 60Hz coding). This thing is not mentioned anywhere on the product but their are 2 ways to know it without opening the bluray package- First, US version has a thicker book case as compared to blue plastic case for the UK version. Second, US version has a picture of Flamingos in the back cover and the UK version has a red frog.<br /><br />Enjoy Life :)hing is not mentioned anywhere on the product but their are 2 ways to know it without opening the bluray package- First, US version has a thicker book case as compared to blue plastic case for the UK version.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it! I can not wait to start reading the last book in the series. Definitely left off with a great cliffhanger.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Best book I have ever read I could feel myself getting attached to all the characters! I loved how innocent Charlie was. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B000003R7G|5.0|This is one awesome album, and on vinyl it's so much cooler! I just love every single track on here, and as a whole, it flows gorgeously. Don't listen to those critics, they're crazy.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my copy was WARPED. Two tracks (All Mine and Humming) skip like crazy. I hate it! So I'll see if Amazon can get me a replacement.<br /><br />Other than that, Portishead is a wonderful album. I recommend it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Stephen King at his best:  well drawn characters, quick moving plot, and a story you never want to end.  Lovely!

0547564651|5.0|As a father of two, this was an important book to me.  It is not a typical parenting book with five steps to a better child, rather it is a scientific book about the dynamics that influence a child's success in life.  Now of course the author defines success as career, relationships, ability to change in this world.  There is not a spiritual dynamic, but unlike some, spiritual success does not mean that one will have worldly success.  Remember Jesus developed in body and mind.  God desires that we develop in all areas of life.  So back to the book, which was an excellent one.  What is interesting is that the book confirms the need for Biblical instruction for children.  Most of the character traits that indicate success are biblically rooted.  But success traits are more than ethical conduct, they are about character, grid, perseverance, and courage.  The book does an excellent job of highlighting the attitudes that are helpful to children.  Much of the research is concerning under privilege children, but of course there is tons of application for middle class homes.  The only lacking element is some practical advice on creating the character traits for parents.  But overall, this book reads well, it is a page turner even though it is filled with scientific experiments.  There are stories about rats, people who overcome poverty  and rich kids will little drive.  This book because of its contact to biblical values is going to help inform some sermons on this topic.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This story is very well done, it is an allegory that speaks to the very heart of human survival. I highly recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season was a heartbreaker. Now I have to wait for next season ans see how the writer's can somehow salvage it. Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining and poignant, but the last episode is tough.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Yeah okay,  so it hasn't got all the fancy stuff you get on The xbox or PC.<br />But for a mini game, it's pretty sweet and mirrors the full game.<br />You still get the option to free create or mine, with or without enemies.<br />And on a tablet it looks awesome.<br /><br />If you're a Minecraft addict and want to play on the move, it's perfect, I love it.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|Great read!  Who knew Dave is a talented author, as well as a talented musician.  Well written and entertaining.  Fab!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It's fun, frustrating and a little addictive.<br /><br />Grab your birds, take aim and flatten those piggies.<br />But it's a lot harder than it looks.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|The number one benefit of this music app for me is the ability to sync music to multiple devices easily with a wifi signal. That was my criteria for choosing this type of app. I like that we can play the music by accessing the amazon music cloud and not just by downloading each song on my kindle as long as I have wifi. I vary the amount of music I want loaded in my kindle and this app makes it easy and convenient to download individual songs or remove them and leave them only in the music cloud to save space. There is a limit to space available without paying for more and it is ok but not great. How can we complain though for a free app with free reliable service. The music streams seamlessly from the app or the cloud when playing, as well
B005HSL626|4.0|A very sweet game to test your reflexs.<br />A little annoying it screencaptures everytime you get a full slice.<br />But it's fun and free.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I have never said a negative word about my Angry Bird applications and I have had them all...until now .  The bad part is not the game design. It is about the way the business end is being handled on this game.It was such a rip-off to pay $2.99 for this app to only give us 2 levels, then have the nerve to make us pay even more if we want the rest of the game.  I got this game because I am a bird fan, not a Star Wars fan. I just wanted to play, but now I won't spend any more money on any Angry Birds games again. These guys are already rich from this game. Why kick your fans who made you rich? Bad move
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is amazing! it has so much more to it, I may never put my kindle down! cant wait to get everything, this is definitely something you want to download, like right now, just go do it. ^~^

0553801503|2.0|After reading the first three books in the series and loving pretty much every page, A Feast for Crows was a horrible disappointment.  Others have already said it better, but plot-wise, almost nothing happens in this book.  Oh, you will learn about characters and more characters and the back history of their houses, but nothing interesting actually happens here.  I cannot tell you how many times I fell asleep while reading it.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, several of your favorite and infamous characters from Book 1-3 don't even make an appearance.  It's hard to imagine what Martin was thinking here.<br /><br />God help HBO if they try to make this boring book into a 13 episode season.  ONE, MAYBE TWO episodes will suffice.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|It's not the regular version, so I don't like it or use it.  Perhaps an Angry Bird afficionado will like it.
B0002KQNL8|5.0|This is a great horror/comedy type of movie i was so scared of it when my dad rented it when i was a kid i watched it in horror thinking they would get me next especialy after seeing the bully turn into a zombie the soundtrack don't bother me cause i can't remember what the original sounded like anyways this is a great movie and well worth the money to own a copy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think the new temple run is great. I love it so much. Its Aldo much more realistic. Awesome!!!! Everyone shoulder beg it also because it is Free! !
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Outliers is filled with interesting facts and figures.  This book will keep you reading long after you thought you would stop for the day.  You don't often hear the word &#34;fun&#34; associated with a book but this was fun to read.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|My girlfriend is a huge Downton Abbey fan. I got this for her as a gift and she likes the extended show rather tan the cut down show shown on American TV. Discs are nicely packaged. This is a must buy for any fan of the series.
B00004YA66|3.0|I was surprised by all the baseball trivia in this movie, which was billed as being a time travel thriller.  It has an interesting premise - a radio signal that travels through time and creates a ripple effect of parallel reality.  Otherwise, it doesn't break a lot of new ground.  It instead tries to be an edgier, more-adult-oriented version of Back to the Future. However, it plays with the butterfly effect a little more gracefully.  Its cultural references are about as dated as those of Back to the Future, and they don't age very well.  Even so, that's a very minor problem.  As a thriller, it still has enough to excite.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very entertaining for animal lovers its free so I would definately recommend it to all ages... didn't think I would like but I play it all the time now
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It has such good graphic even if it's a little hard to actually beat nightmare moon. Heh
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved it and couldn't wait to see the next epsiode. So I ended up staying up until 3:00 am and watching the whole season.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|My daughter got me started on watching this show . We have seen all seasons & every show at least 2-3 times each. The cuties that star in the show are great. But the plots for each show will keep you hooked to always want more. We got all 7 seasons for my daughter at Christmas we love it so much. Definately a must see.

B00004WG2X|5.0|This is an older BBC production that ran on Great Performances in the 70's.  It is well cast, and has a number of scenes and lines which come to mind whenever I think of the novel.  It runs over 5 hours, but even my hubby can sit through it in one long Sunday afternoon!  The time flies (blink, blink!).  It is close to the novel, but not as close as the BBC version with Colin Firth, which has become my favorite (after watching both versions dozens of times).  I still watch this version for those lines and looks which are only captured here.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|As usual, Streep is amazing in here character. Jones isn't one of my favorites but he is good and great to watch. I'm a 22 year old so I don't know precisely how accurate this film was, but I know it was funny and seems believable.<br />  It focuses on a side of an old married couple that I've never seen done before. Jones' character does seem a little cruel at times to the point that it seemed a little ingenuous (that a an old couple that loves each other this much could really treat each other like that) but not enough to ruin the movie. Other than the subject matter, it wasn't all that special of a movie.<br />  I did enjoy it, but the story and visuals were nothing special earning it a three, maybe a three and a half. Unfortunately, I can't give a half, and it seems like its on the shorter end of 3 and half, so its better fit with a 3 than a four. Still, it's worth watching at least once I think, especially if your a fan of Jones or Streep--or even Carell I suppose.
0399226907|5.0|Arrived quickly and was extremely affordable, this book always draws in my kid when reading it because of the colors and holes in the pages it's perfect
0985081821|5.0|I loved all the characters in this book even the bad guys were fun to read they were so determined but delusional and pretty psychotic. Thalia and Circe were fun to read about and the queen Calista was plain creepy! Marcus made me ill and every time he was around Sophia it gave me anxiety I was so glad when he died.
B008LV05EG|2.0|After seeing Rita on VH1 live, I fell in love with her voice and style of music.  I feel like this particular CD, however, devalues everything I love about her.  It is completely overproduced and she sounds nothing like she does live.  There is no distinction between her and any other artist on the radio today.  Although some of the songs are catchy, I was disappointed with how the production of the CD muffles her voice and ultimate talent.  She needs to put out a &#34;live&#34; CD so people can get the full experience of what I heard on VH1.

B0032Y0OH0|4.0|I was skeptical when I purchased the Shuttle, it seemed like one of those tech things you see that is a good idea, but falls short. I was quickly proven wrong. I use my machine at home for freelance work supplementing my income, so my mind is on cutting costs as much as possible. This was well worth it. It has a software bundle that allows you to assign buttons to whatever your hearts desire, along with a drop down menu for most of the popular software bundles out there. Straight out of the box it is functional, but since every person has different work habits and quirks, modifying the buttons was easy and then you can save your custom template. I went ahead and took the time to set it up for all my programs and now just have to hit the task bar to swap settings. The only cons I have found thus far working with this device is sometimes losing my hand placement when typing, and sometimes putting the wrong profile which in the future would like a auto detect and load your settings automatically.

0307352153|4.0|A year or longer ago, I read an article by Susan Cain that was the thesis of her book, Quiet. When I saw it for review at Blogging for Books, I did not hesitate to order it.<br /><br />It is an interesting read from page one. She offers extensive research, anecdotes, and insight to make the claim that introversion, or being shy, should not be seen as a weakness or fault of character, but as a strength and ability that has provided us with so much over the centuries.<br /><br />I agree with the author that we in the States, may be living a pathological era of exalting extroverts, and forcing implicitly or explicitly, our children and adults to display social (or what we understand by it), and outgoing and outspoken traits at school, workplace, and any situations that call for interaction.<br /><br />The book, specially the first part, reminded me much of Endangered Minds, in regards to how both books present extensive research and studies. I believe that, for both authors to defend their points, their observation and experience are very valid ways of drawing conclusions, that their extensive references to studies and research on the topics they address, does not necessarily give their hypothesis or tenets more conviction than that which they already possess after they argue and argument them wisely. Some of the research I find it a bit comical. Of course, I am one of those crazy creationists, but all that part of us, humans, being like we are because our ancestors millions of years ago were hunters, or that paradoxically we kept x or y trait despite of it not being of a help for survival, drawing conclusions and analogies from the behavior of monkeys and our interpretation of it... it truly elicits many grins. As I say, I do not believe they add to the credibility of what it is being presented.<br /><br />No research is meant to tell us that TV or screen time in excess is bad for children and adults alike much more than any woman who has been for a long day or week with her own children or other children can tell you. No research that observes the brain in expensive studies about behavior is needed to conclude, with Susan Cain, that a good balance of the introverted traits and extroverted traits is desired, and that to completely negate or undermine introverts, is a great loss for any society or any private relationship.<br /><br />I need to notice a strong disagreement with the author and what she writes on pages 242 and 243 that I will not discuss here.<br /><br />For the second part of this review, I would like to notice that the last pages of the book were a surprising read to me as a mom who homeschools her two daughters. While the book is not oriented or focused on education, the last part explores what school is for introverted children. From the pen of a woman that does not seem very aware of this phenomenon, (the alternatives she gives to parents whose children do not thrive in schools due to their introversion never contemplate the possibility of educating them at home AT ALL, which was a bit of a surprise to me). As I read the book, I saw many children and grown ups I know in her descriptions, and for some, I thought how wonderful it is that their parents homeschool them, allowing them to bloom and to have their shyness or introversion as a great strength and such a gift at a very early age.<br /><br />Allow me then, to type some of Susan words in those pages when she analyzes schools. The quote comes after she talks about the painful experience of a girl named Maya, in one of those group activities in her fifth grade class. Maya is describe by her teachers as an intellectually alive student who shines in her essay-writing. She's a gifted softball player. And she's kind to others, offering to tutor other children who lag behind academically. But none of Maya's positive attributes were evident that morning. She was unable to participate, and looked down as stupid.<br /><br />  The truth is that many schools are designed for extroverts. Introverts need different kinds of instruction from extroverts, write College of Williams and Mary education scholars Jill Burruss and Lisa Kaenzig. And too often, \\"very little is made available to that learner except constant advice on becoming more social and gregarious.\\"<br />  We tend to forget that there's nothing sacrosanct about learning in large group classrooms, and that we organize students this way not because it's the best way to learn but because it's cost-efficient, and what else would we do with our children while the grown-ups are at work? If your child prefers to work autonomously and socialize one-on-one, there's nothing wrong with her; she just happens not to fit the prevailing model. The purpose of school should be to prepare kids for the rest of their lives, but too often what kids need to be prepared for is surviving the school day itself.<br />  The school environment can be highly unnatural, especially from the perspective of an introverted child who loves to work intensely on projects he cares about, and hang out with one or two friends at a time. In the morning, the door to the bus opens and discharges its occupants in a noisy, jostling mass. Academic classes are dominated by group discussions in which a teacher prods him to speak up. He eats lunch in the cacophonous din of the cafeteria, where he has to jockey for a place at a crowded table. Worst of all, there's little time to think or create. The structure of the day is almost guaranteed to sap his energy rather than stimulate it.<br />  Why do we accept this one-size-fits-all situation as a given when we know perfectly well that adults don't organize themselves this way? We often marvel at how introverted, geeky kids \\"blossom\\" into secure and happy adults. We liken it to a metamorphosis. However, maybe it's not the children who change but their environments. As adults, they get to select the careers, spouses, and social circles that suit them. They don't have to live in whatever culture they're plunked into. Research from a field known as \\"person-environment fit\\" shows that people flourish when, in the words of psychologist Brian Little, they're \\"engaged in occupations, roles or settings that are concordant with their personalities.\\" The inverse is also true: kids stop learning when they feel emotionally threatened. (Pages 253, 254)<br /><br />Susan Cain is not writing about homeschooling, she does not seem to know much about it, it is not mentioned. It is her candid and witty criticism of schools. She is defending with all her might and brain, those people like her, introverts. Not just to be the introvert redeemer, but for the sake of everyone, for the sake of each society, business, and ultimately family. It is about time we pay attention to this trait many of us around us possess in their character, a potential asset and gift ready to be acknowledge, fostered, and admired.ed for extroverts.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book really held my attention; I hadn't known much of the story line, except that I knew that there was a competition where the young people in the story fought to the death to stay alive themselves.. I was almost afraid to read it; I thought I wouldn't be able to sleep because it would be too, too..In reality, I found that I couldn't sleep, because I had to read one more chapter!!!

1451629192|1.0|I bought the book for my mother as a birthday gift. She wanted the book so bad! Thought the book was good until I got about half way through it and realized that it was repeating itself?? Around page 60 it started over at page 20 something and then you couldn't read the story again until page 90 something. Idk if this was a publishing issue or why the book had 15-20 of the same pages in there twice, but I wasnt happy. The book was totally screwed and it was quite upsetting.

B001VNB54A|5.0|This takes the Band of Brothers sort of WWII series to new level.  The Blu Ray is amazing for both visuals and sound.  Forget all the blathering by right wingers, this shows the horrible conditions faced by Marines in the Pacific, honors their bravery and courage, and makes it plain that fighting the Japanese could be a lot more brutal than fighting the &#34;civilized&#34; Germans.  One thing I miss with this is a lack of coverage of Navy and naval battles.  You only get a sense of what is going on in the water on a few occasions. While this is not completely historically accurate--it is a composite based on several classic WWII memoirs--it does a good job with its source material.  It does an especially  decent treatment of Sledge's &#34;With the Old Breed&#34; (which is a must read for anyone interested in WWII combat from a Marine's perspective.)

B009GX69RK|5.0|the best part about this quirky show is that it takes nothing seriously. its a show about being dorks and having a great time being dorks. i have laughed so hard at this show now and then that i have been amazed that they managed to get it on mainstream television. there are episodes that are stronger than others...but it is soooo worth pushing through the somewhat weaker ones just to have the privilege of finding the gold...dork gold.

B00A8ECU24|3.0|(ORIGINAL REVIEW) Its hard to admit this, but I really enjoy this game despite being an adult. I'm getting pretty high up in levels now and I can tell that soon Ill have to actually spent money if I want the last few ponies. My only problem is that I have no idea how to add neighbors. Since I play the game on both my kindles, my only neighbor is myself. I go to gl live but still don't know how to add friends. my one account shows up with a profile picture that is not me. I don't know who it is or why its there...perhaps someone else originally had that username? anyway...its a fun game.  (UPDATED REVIEW)  This game was so addicting at first, then I got to level 60,and the fun stopped. Up until the update, which took months, you could not advance any higher. There was also nothing left to buy for Ponyville unless you purchaced gems. Then came the update, and with it I advanced several levels instantly. But I did not like the update at all. Another town was added, one you have travel to by train,and this town has completely different buildings and houses that you can buy, but only for that town. Besides that, the new town is horribly ugly...its colors are painful to look at...so drab and poorly done. They should have just expanded the original town and added more goals. The new addition is horrible. I have not played since. Even my three year old has lost interest since the update. If the colors cant attract a child, someone has done something wrong.
1592407889|5.0|I don't normally read Hollywood memoirs, but after an episode yesterday where my own mother bought me a girdle (!!!!), I thought, hey, let's read Sachi Parker's book about her mom.  I was really, really pleasantly surprised.  It was not a let's trash mom book; it was very well written and thoughtful.  She shares many pleasant memories of her mother and some not so pleasant ones, and this made the book very well worth the read.  I think Ms. Parker probably learned a lot about herself when she was writing the book, and I learned a lot about myself too.  Definitely give it a shot!!!
B007JCP8FE|4.0|I like this album because it has a few good rockers that I listen to when I am at the gym.  It has a few good ballads, and Amaryllis the song has a good nostalgic feel to it. The reason I didn't give it a 5 out of 5 is because I thought It could have had more impressive guitar solos in Amaryllis, Bully, etc...
B005ZUR724|5.0|I love this mega rpg game! As a baby boomer,  I've played my share of rpgs and this is one of the best! Join the masses and make some friends from all over the world.  Join the best party for the best price. You'll be so happy you did!  See you online!

0345529057|3.0|While I love the story, I can't stand how often this author uses the word \\"sweet\\" throughout these books. \\"Sweetling\\", \\"sweet brother, cousin, and especially, sweet sister\\" are used almost every page under several narratives (see Tyrion throughout Clash of Kings or Theon in same), and sometimes multiple times per page! It annoyed me so much I almost couldn't finish the books. Don't get me wrong, I think Martin is a fantastic author, I just wish he was a little more aware of how often he uses those particular phrases (and would knock it off!).
0670878014|4.0|Reason for Reading:  I intend to read the upcoming non-fiction title \\"The Lady and Her Monsters\\" which is about the writing and background of the creation of the novel \\"Frankenstein\\" so I thought it would be best if I re-read the book to better appreciate the former.<br /><br />I am a huge Frankenstein fan!  I first watched the Boris Karloff movie as a young child and have since seen it dozens of times.  I've seen all the MGM sequels and have a deluxe DVD edition with commentaries, etc.  I've also seen many, many different remakes, pastiches and parodies of the movie as well as reading Frankenstein themed retellings, comics and pastiches.  I have read this, the original book, once before when I was quite young.  It was one of the first books I took out of the library when I obtained an adult library card with special permission of my father at 12 or 13.  (You had to be 14, or in highschool, to get one at the time).  Needless to say at this point in time 30 years later, the movie version, specifically the James Whale (Boris Karloff) version is the one that I think of when I think of the Frankenstein story.<br /><br />When I went into reading this book I knew that it was a totally different story than what my mind recalls from the movies but I also remembered that it started in the Arctic with the monster relating his story to Frankenstein.  So from this I was totally blown away with how incredibly different the actual story is to the conceived modern notion of the tale.  The book is told in narrative form from three different points of view and is a story within a story within a story.  Starting off with a mariner writing home letters to his sister as he starts an Arctic expedition and then becomes stuck in ice he recounts his tale and his meeting of Victor Frankenstein who stumbles upon them near death in his mad chase of his creature.  Then Walton, the mariner, recounts the tale that Frankenstein relates to him of his life.  The awful, hideous story of his wretched life.  Halfway through this recounting Frankenstein stops to relate the story the creature pauses to tell him of his life story since he woke from the \\"spark of life\\" and wandered into the world on his own.  Then it goes back to Frankenstein's narrative and finally ends again with Walton's letters.  This way we get both Frankenstein and the creature's tales from their own mouths, in their own words as they were related to the person they spoke to.<br /><br />Neither Frankenstein or the creature are sympathetic which I found surprising, as in the movie I am deeply sympathetic to Karloff's monster.  But in the novel, he is a vile, wicked, murdering beast who at first thinks he has human compassion but quickly is turned from having any and easily finds violence and revenge better to his suiting when he is not treated fairly by others.  Frankenstein himself is simply mad, the quintessential mad scientist.  Obsessed with his creation he thinks of nothing else, working in solitude day and night until he completes his reanimation of life.  Upon first glimpse of this \\"life\\" he is so horrified that he runs from it and from this point on he becomes obsessed with finding it and destroying it, however the monster has developed his own lust for destroying Frankenstein and sets out to destroy him also, not bodily but in mind and soul by killing all who mean anything to him.<br /><br />A frightening tale that shows the futility and madness at playing God with science, even though the book mentions very little about religion.  This edition I read from \\"The Whole Story\\" edition is a wonderful annotated edition which really brings the classics to life.  The annotations don't particularly help explain the story any better, though there are some pictures and definitions of some items and devices one may not be familiar with.  The main purpose of these annotations is to set one geographically and historically within the place and era that the book was written. Profusely illustrated with etchings and paintings of place names mentioned in the story one becomes immersed in the scenery and in this book particularly the Gothic feel comes to life.  Historically we see the prisons of the time period, meet the Romantic poets and artists who shaped the life of the author and the mood which carried over into this novel.  I really enjoy and recommend this edition, have several others in the series and would pick up any others I found, but unfortunately they are out of print at this time.h etchings and paintings of place names mentioned in the story one becomes immersed in the scenery and in this book particularly the Gothic feel comes to life.

0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has the writing style and the passion for this series no one else could have emulated to finish Jordan's saga. He wrapped everything up in a tight package that flowed the same way i would have expected Jordan to do. The best part is that there was room left at the end for speculation about what may come next. I am excited for the fan fiction.
0451197879|3.0|Reason for Reading:  I'm re/reading Stephen King's works in chronological order and this was next in line.<br /><br />This is my first re-read that I went into it with absolutely no memory of the story whatsoever.  And my copy only has some vague sentence about an angry man fighting back as a summary so I was none the wiser from that.  As I read it really didn't come back to me either, which is strange as I completely remember the other three in my omnibus edition.<br /><br />This is a hard book for me to review as it got better as I read it.  Honestly, I was quite bored for the first half and didn't really get hooked until close to the end when the excitement built.  This is a story that tries too hard to show the reader the mental breakdown of a man.  One who looses it and goes out \\"guns blazing\\".  When we meet Bart he's already well down the road to no return, hearing a voice and talking with it.  The book takes a long time to slowly let the reader know who this voice is and what the whole story behind it is and this is part of the book's slowness and what made it such a bland read for the most part.  Now, even though I seem negative here; the book wasn't bad; in fact it was good.  This story is a thinker.  Bart is 'crazy' when we meet him and in my mind the deeper he goes into his insanity the saner he becomes, until at the end of the book when he can be viewed as a madman, he is at his ultimate sanest moment in the entire book.  He has taken himself where he wanted to end up even though he didn't know it as far back as a few years ago when \\"the incident\\" happened and he's enjoyed these last weeks getting there.  I was satisfied with the read at the end, even though I had a hard time really getting into it.<br /><br />This is the first Bachman that I truly felt was King.  The writing style, the stream of consciousness, the dialogue are all classic King and thinking back I can see true fans of the time putting the clues together at this point and outing King as Bachman (or at least suspecting) with this book.<br /><br />When I read a King, I always look out for connections to other books and the only one I noticed here was one of the laundry machines was called The Mangler.  This is the name of a machine (perhaps even the title?) in a short story in \\"Night Shift\\".achman (or at least suspecting) with this book.<br /><br />When I read a King, I always look out for connections to other books and the only one I noticed here was one of the laundry machines was called The Mangler.

B004LWZWGK|1.0|Movie quality is great, amazon prime shipping was great!  Gave one star due to ultra violet.  I own Apple products, I expect to be able to use a (digital copy) on my device without having to create a flixster and ultra violet account.  Contacted UltraViolet and was told the only way to transfer the movie to a device was to create the flixster account and download the app.  Maybe not such a big deal, but I've purchased and used many digital copies and have never had to create additional accounts.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|This Burton addition to the claymation family of movies will not disappoint. The characters are all so engaging. They make references and nods to movie classics like Frankenstein and Godzilla. I also love that it's in black and white. Recommended for any age.

B009JBZH54|4.0|Great movie but hey, what about my digital copy. Come on people. All movies should have them included. Not that ultraviolet stuff either.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love it way better than temple run and temple run brave  awesome!!!!!!!!!!<br />Also, cool graphics i love to get diamonds and the coin meter gives you something if you fill it up and double tap your screen
0060555661|3.0|This is a hard read.  The subject is difficult to begin with.  With the writing spanning so many years and rewrites and commentary on the original subject matter, it is hard to follow.  I have not finished the book, so I can't really comment on the quality of the subject matter.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Works great. Blocks out neighborhood noises which kept me awake, then shuts off at designated time so that it doesn't use up battery (less than 2 %).
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|This is one of the best dance movies. Someday I want to see the original Japanese version. Jennifer Lopez is amazing as always!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is an excellent period drama. While all of the characters are excellent, Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess is simply superb. Her wit and humor are spectacular. Do yourself a favor and watch all three seasons on amazon.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I had to watch this a few times in order to pick up on all the hints. For that reason, it's an enjoyable film.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very good read, especially for the price. The author really puts you inside the minds of his characters. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys sci-fi or end of days type books.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|I really liked this movie. Peter Parker's &#34;emo-ness&#34; is less than appreciated, but I enjoyed the positive message at the end.
1439152802|5.0|I have loved all of Kate Morton's four books, but this one is the best!!  She is a master at all the elements of literature; characters are real, setting creates such a feeling, and the plot always, always keeps you guessing!  The Secret Keeper truly lives up to its name because there are so many surprises here!  Kate Morton writes amazing literature!  This is my new favorite book!
B000VAPZM2|3.0|I haven't watched this movie in years and I'm a bit older now... I haven't watched yet. It was really cute though and I'm sure I can fully enjoy it again when my little cousins are older.

B00005JKG9|5.0|Great movie. Bought it to show someone in sales the ABC's. I would recommend this movie to anyone especially to any getting into sales to see how ruthless it can be.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Loved the movie and love the CD.  The music is wonderfully written and performed and tells a very sad story beautifully.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|From start to finish, it is perfect. With all the crap people seem to love nowadays I was wary; but, this book took my breathe away. Dignified and fully developed characters & beautifully, well constructed prose -I feel in love.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a selection for our book club to read.  I'm a huge fan of &#34;legal&#34; novels and this was no exception.  The psychological and genetic aspects were intriguing.  I was engaged from the beginning to the end.  Great book club book--lots of discussion points.
B000E5DOHW|5.0|A lot of books  have been written about logic. This is not a logic book.  YAY  Polya wrote a two-volume work called Induction and Analogy in Mathematics, which is about the use of induction-- hunches, intuition, smart guessing.  I liked that so much that I found How to Solve it.<br />Between them all, I see a real opportunity to improve the sharpness of one's thinking.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Entertaining with a courtroom edge.  Typical of this author and he never fails to satisfy.<br />My husband reads this too  and we both will purchase more of Grisham's books.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|After reading the first two books of this trilogy, I was not disappointed with the third and final installment. Stieg Larson did a masterful job in wrapping up this story about abuse against a young woman, how it affected her life and how she got justice.<br /><br />This book is not my normal genre choice.  I'm partial to espionage and political thrillers but this book (as did the first two installments) kept me reading for hours, I found it hard to put down and finished it in two days.<br /><br />A great read, but be sure to read the first two or you won't fully understand a lot of what's really happening and why.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was so much better than I expected. I assumed it would be a typical romance story and thought I had figured out the big secret....I was so wrong! Loved the characters and the surprises!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great game -- tiles are a little small, but get easier to read as you go along.  Background music is very fitting.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the game in any form.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|I read all three after viewing the first movie. I Was going to wait till I saw all three movies but got itchy fingers and got them all. I wish I hadn't. Loved the books, loved the movies, but am sure I would have enjoyed the movie more if I had read the books afterwards.<br />I'll wait for another 6 months and view the movies again.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Excellent photography and excellent sound production make this an awesome look back at the incredible career of Led Zeppelin.  Plant, Page & Jones play and sing like no others, and Jason Bonham does his dad proud on the skins.  Loved every second of this spectacular concert.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|My son got me onto them, we were in his car one day and this c.d. was on. I asked about them and eventually bought the album. I really enjoyed it but did think there was something not quite great about it, The songs had a sameness about them. It is enjoyable though. I still bought their follow up album.
B009DT98RK|5.0|Very surprised - and happy - to see that a large share of this was filmed at our local Pabst Theater in Milwaukee - a great old building and venue for more intimate concerts.  Frampton hasn't lost his guitar playing prowess, his vocals are still strong, though he does struggle a little with the high notes - and his bandmates are good players to back him up.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|I did love this, I have played it quite a few times and every time I feel so emotional at the end when Joe Brown plays the ukelele and sings 'I'll See You In My Dreams'.  I'll bet there wasn't a dry eye in the house.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is one of the best free games I have ever played, it's better than most played one's too.if you haven't already downloaded it,go now,do it it's worth $4 but it's free go get it
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I have watched this quite a few times over the years and every time I it i just love it more and more. The musicians are great to watch and to listen to, all very talented, couldn't help but wonder where Bob Dylan was though. Great seeing his son Dahni playing. It's hard to give a critique without being picky about some of the personalities. McCartney as condescending as always. But I won't mention him.<br />I loved it, every time I watch I get emotional at the end when Joe Brown plays 'I'll See you in My Dreams' on the ukelele.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Very entertaining and exiting story. Jack Reacher is a more modern Batman; slightly more realistic, better with women and more cruel to his enemies. Childs formula can't go wrong!
0783230079|4.0|I didn't like this at first, I thought it was corny, trite. But a friend loved it and so had been watched a few times while I tried to avoid it and, against my better judgement, I came to enjoy it. Downey Jr is as always a treat to watch. The cast are great. And yes it's such emotional puppet-work, you can almost see the strings being pulled as each setting is put together. But then I'm a cynic.   Yes, I recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|loved this app but I personally like how the first one had much more random paths that you could choose from
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|This triology were three of the best reads from the last 18 months. As mentioned in another review I watched the first movie, read the book, then meant to wait for the next movie before reading the book. Couldn't wait. Read all three and loved them.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Having purchased and read all of John Grisham's books and the movies based on his novels, one can surmise that I really like his stories.  He never fails to please me, keeps my interest thoughout.<br /><br />Even though I always buy his latest book, I love reading the reviews of other lovers of Grisham novels.<br />I thank the reviewers for their interesting thoughts.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|I didn't see any previews or read any synopsis' for this movie prior to buying it. Being an aviation buff I decided I must see this movie, plus w/ an all star cast I figured it had to be at least a decent flick. I was expecting a movie about a commercial airline mishap or a harrowing flight or something else along those lines, but what I was not expecting was the the jaw dropping opening scene which I watched in disbelief of what I was seeing. Denzel Washington's performance as a borderline arrogant Captain who thinks the laws & rules don't apply to him, struggling to maintain his own denial of the state of his life, was in my opinion, 1st class. Along w/ the supporting cast, this movie took a very intimate look at very real issues people from all walks of life face & did not sugar coat it or dumb it down to keep it politically correct. I would highly recommend this movie as a must see.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|Or is it?  Jodie Foster, Matt McCauhahay, everyone in the flick is great.  Got it on sale, a great buy as I love Sci-Fi, especially when it'son sale.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this game because my brother said minecraft is awesome some so I bought it  and I loved it so much it is worth 7bucks
B001AR4K8K|5.0|Great seeing the stars as they were when they were a bit older than kids!  &#60;G&#62;  Great story too.  What more can I say but &#34;More Teeth&#34;!
B00846REIS|5.0|This was a great read especially if you loved Fifty Shades of Grey, I think i enjoyed this series even more. Definitely will have you wanting  more. I Can't wait for the 3rd book to come out
0812993357|4.0|This is a great memoir about Grace Coddington's life in modeling, magazines, and Fashion.  Grace has many engaging and interesting stories of her life and career in the world of Fashionistas.  There is just enough dirt without being trashy.  I would label this memoir as more of a career biography.  Grace talks at length about her fears of public speaking, people, groups, etc.  I think this fear keeps her from divulging too much about her private life.  I wish we could learn a bit more about Grace, the person, because what she brushed upon in the book was extremely interesting, I can only imagine the feelings and stories and emotions that go beyond the snippets and personal life events that are fleeting in this memoir.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was an excellent second book in the temptation series! I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out! Has a great story and very steamy. Loved it maybe even more than Fifty
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|Too much overwritten sloppy sentiment is ruining this once fine drama. The plot lines are becoming repetitive and I yearn for more than romance and vindictive servants trying to get the better of each other. Only Lady Edith's life is at all interesting. The introduction of 18 year old Rose provided some welcome relief. Perhaps they can take her character to some more jazz clubs to give a bit more fun and color.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Of what possible interest could a review by some nobody (me, in this case) be for a movie that is one of the greatest classics in the history of moviemaking?<br /><br />I hardly think customer reviews are relevant in the case of movies in this category.
B0089XH38M|2.0|the app has to be forced closed often and doesn't allow me to fix any threats it finds. it is a nicely laidout app and looks nice. just wish it would work like it says.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book had a profound affect on me emotionally and physically through the experiences of this girl.  Her progress from being completely shut down from all people and the world in general to learning to let people in to touch her and teach her that she isn't damaged and she is loveable is described in words that last long after I put the book down for a time.  The description of flowers and the love for them resonated with me and I will go back to this again and again to refer to a particular flower.  Ms. Diffenbaugh writes from the heart and life experience.  I will tell everyone about this book.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This book was better than I remember! A must read for those that like controversy, drama, twists and turns! Emily Bronte never lets the reader down!
0345529057|5.0|This book, like the show, is quite good.  No, quite good is an understatement, They'rrrrrrrrrrrrrrre Grrrrrrrrreat!  Seriously though just buy it.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This item Is everything I thought it would be.  Keep my Kindle Fire secure and protected.  Would recommend this item.
B00000273M|5.0|If you loved the songs of the Bangels way back when, then you will love this CD as they truly do have the BEST of their songs on here. Love this CD!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun and amusing love the way the graphics picture the horse and the adio is great . wish it was easier to get gems and the energy didn't run out so fast tho..
B000000WF0|5.0|This is a fairly good album as the very 1st song is my favorite, the other songs are ok, but don't compare to the first one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great app. keeps my 4 year old daughter busy while I'm cleaning or playing with her 9 month old brother. it even keeps her clam while we r in the car for a while.
B007P06DOK|5.0|This allows me to save my original vinal copy and still allows me to play it constantly.  The quality is as expected.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Great book. I read it once, then immediately read it over again to make sure I didn't miss anything! Highly recommend!
0394873742|5.0|Loves reading with Oma and stretched out on the floor.<br />Well made and with Richard Scarry's great drawings with energy and movement throughout.  Seems like it will stand up to the test of kids.  Could even wipe off spills with damp cloth.
1609419693|5.0|I would recommend Bossypants to anyone interested in a very entertaining audiobook. Tina Fey is hilarious! This audiobook exceeded my expectations. I listened to this audiobook in my car during my commute, and my commute switched from a low point of my day to a high point of my day!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|BEST SERIES in a long time. I love every episode! I was ' addicted&#34; at one point and glad it was winter so I could make excuses and stay in to watch.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great read .this dude can write .He makes you think too.<br />I'm gonna see what else I can find written by Hugh Howey.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. It has given me a lot of enthusiasm I never thought I'd have about lifting. I hadn't really taken it seriously before I read it, and much of the advice in there made a lot of sense to me, so I have taken a lot of notes and re-read several sections 2-3 times. I especially like the advice on warming up with few reps, and that he provides evidence to support his conclusions (studies, etc), such as the optimum number of reps and sets per exercise. Evidence matters to me, as does the statement in one chapter that \\"if you can't measure it, you don't know it!\\"<br /><br />I will update the review in a few months once I know what kind of progress I'm making.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Great book, good for conversation starters, sometimes a little to statistical, but essence is fun.  I'd recommend it to people who like to think and converse.
0815411839|5.0|Well written and extremely well documented story of Marilyn Monroe. This book provides new insights into a complex woman who is much more than the myth.  Highly recommended.
B0018RFLN0|3.0|Peter Graves/Jim Phelps did not deserve to become a turncoat. Very disappointed in this aspect of the movie. As a matter of fact it rather pisses me off. Sure am hoping that the Bruce Geller \\"team\\" did not write off on that aspect of the script/film rights. And yes, sure he COULD have done that but he never did in the TV series so why do this just to create the Ethan Hunt character as the lead? Why not just have him get killed in the first movie and have Hunt fill his shoes.<br /><br />The movies never take on the same character of the TV series and frankly I wish that they had just put out an action thriller using a different name. NOT true to the original concept. The only thing similar is that Ethan gets to hear the mission via some clever recording as per the TV show. Big deal. That is where it all ends.<br /><br />As an action thriller movie the series is decent. Acting, however, is too camp. When will our USA studios stop using worn out script formats that are rah rah, lets all high five and yell out after something goes right. It's really getting old, folks.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I would highly suggest reading this book! It will really show you what true love is and it makes you feel like it's real!
B00505QAUY|4.0|I saw this film last night and have to say that the scene where joseph kills the pitbull whi savages the young boy was a sad indictment of the nature of our society embodied by the thuggish boyfriend who's almost in tears when the deed is done and yet didnt get the dog sent to a resuce home after it savaged the child after he and hsi friend constantly teased it and eventually it snapped.<br />All in all, the story of joseph and hannah was good in showing that his assumptions of her life in the beginning were unfounded snd clouded by his own bitterness another thing that I think afflicts many poorer areas in the Uk.
B000IKQMFO|3.0|It wasn't as good as i thought it would be. Since it was supposed to be the inspiration for Downton Abby I expected it to be much more entertaining than it was.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its way better than # 1.  Hurts my eyes. Of course I'm waiting on new glasses. Keeps your attention glued.
B007ZTLLMK|1.0|Ok, so I ibstall this app, try it out and it is actually a fairly well constructed app. Seems like the physics are all in order and graphics are decent.<br />.....Then I start getting completely unsolicited ad notifications in my notification bar. I naturally assume I had installed a program recently that had airpush ads or something, so I dowload the airpush detector and nothing shows up. I spent a whole day uninstalling programs, and waiting to see if the ads stopped. I don't know why I tried thus app last, maybe because it was an Amazon App and seemed rather unassuming. Sure enough though, uninstalled it and ads stopped.<br /><br />Would give any app that puts unsolicited ad notufications on my bar less than zero stars no matter how cool it is. Suck it!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|but finds the puzzles a bit difficult.  might be best for an older child.  The drawing of the figure is fun for all.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved loved loved this book it was def one that keep your attention  that you couldnt put down and held all the way to the end
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Except for a few more serious works by Grisham like The Chamber, which I consider his best, they are all very readable and entertaining. As a former practicing attorney, both Grisham and me, his cynical but light and somewhat humorous approach to the legal system is entertaining and contains strong elements of truth beneath the sometime exaggerated fun. This book is not his best, but as usual, it is an entertaining read.<br />What I always appreciate in  a Grisham novel is his technique of guiding the reader through the sometimes arcane, but mostly necessary procedural steps in our legal system which can be best described as very imperfect, but the best around when it comes to the presumption of innocence. Unlike a lot of legal procedural crime writers, he gets to the point without stumbling around like some writers. I'm waiting for his next one, always hoping that it will match The Chamber or his most entertaining novel The Runaway Jury.
B0088QQ0CU|5.0|I'e read all his earlier books, only in the past year, and the changes I have made have been phenomenal.  I can't recommend it enough!.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|Reminded me of Forrest Gump Swedish style -<br />not my most favourite read - got lost at times<br />in the switching back and forth
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|This was the nail on the coffin of why i love the games and hate the movies.  There was some entertainment value for fast shoot'em up zombie killing and whatnot, but overall it was another disappointment in the Resident Evil movie saga.  I'd just redbox it if you REALLY want to see it that bad, only pay 2 bucks.
1401907725|5.0|I bought these cards as a gift for my daughter and she loves them.  She has used them through troubling times and was calm and filled with wisdom through out.
0205313426|4.0|It was very eco friendly packaging and it came FAST!<br />Thanks! the hardcover wads a great choice! Recommend highly, thanks
B00992CF6W|5.0|I would rate Minecraft 999 stars if I could. It is even better with the very recent update. Now you have signs and armor and some other features Mojang THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! it is worth $7.00 :-)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the best Tv Shows I have ever seen!<br />If you like movies like Sense and Sensibility and The Remains of the Day you gonna to love this show!
0061900656|5.0|Great book! Fast shipping! Easy to read, and the pictures are great for visual learners! A must have for preparing children for a baby.
0307277887|1.0|I wanted to like it. I really, really did.<br /><br />The premise of this book is exceptional, and has since entered the public consciousness with the successful conversion of these books to a cable television show. A sociopathic serial killer keeps his Dark Passenger at bay by confining the indulgence of his urges to those who deserve it: other, less discriminating serial killers. To disguise himself and further his own ends, he works as a blood spatter analyst with the Miami Metro Police Department. His rather unique insight into the mind of a killer not only makes him very good at his job, but affords him ample opportunities to catch the bad guys before his fellow cops can, and deal with them in his own special way.<br /><br />Here's my problem: I watched and enjoyed the show first. Normally I can draw a distinction between the characters in a book and in its film or TV counterpart, but in this case, the differences are too drastic.<br /><br />I'm used to seeing Dexter as somewhat gormless--indeed, almost innocently naïve--in his quest to understand normal human emotions in order to better emulate them. This leads to an odd kind of sympathy for him, as we learn more about his past and how he was shaped into the monster he is. In the book, however, he is uniformly callous about everything, and his inner monologue never deviates from insulting literally everyone around him. True, he is darkly humorous, but I didn't really find him all that clever. Maybe it's because his supposed genius is remarkable only because every other character is astoundingly shallow and incompetent (another difference from the show). I'm supposed to find Dexter disarming and brilliant. Instead, I found him to be an unlikeable jerk. A murderous unlikeable jerk, at that.<br /><br />I went in knowing who the killer is, but even if I hadn't, the plot simply wouldn't have worked for me. There is no way to track the ending; all of the pertinent information on Dexter's connection to the killer isrevealed in the very last part of the story. This lends some interesting dimension to the weird visions of the killer's whereabouts that Dexter has, but doesn't do anything to explain them. Instead, the conclusion drops in like a thundering deus ex machina. Add in a twist ending that doesn't actually end anything, and you end up with a very annoyed reader.<br /><br />Sigh. I love the premise, but I just don't love the book. I am guilty of librarian heresy: I like the show better. Someone teased out the best parts of Dexter's character, and someone else found a good actor; between the two of them, Dexter became what I think Lindsay intends him to be. This is definitely worth reading for those who like gory thrillers, and especially those who appreciate black humor. For me, though, it was a letdown.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So much fun. More challenging than the previous. I love it. And all the new objectives! I recommend this game/app for all ages. my one year old loves to watch me play!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best running games I've played not compared to temple run but still a good game for everyone.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|This is actually the second book I read from this author. I did like the book even though some parts were a little boring.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game it is waybetter then thefirst templw run. temple run 2 is better buh i love both. subway wufers should have a subway surfers 2 where it is better
B006WWU8IO|4.0|This album is typical Taylor Swift.  I like her music, but it all sounds the same after a few songs.  I bought it because of her song on The Hunger Games.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this book. The Lucky One was the first Nicholas Sparks book I read. Since then I have read a few more, but so far its one of my favorites. I can't wait to see the movie.
B002GTZSZU|5.0|This is an amazing movie, especially for lovers of classical music.  Or it could be a perfect intro to Mozart for regular people too.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The second Nicholas Sparks book that I have read. I'm really starting to enjoy him as an author. It was so good I read it in two days. I can't wait to see the movie.
B002N7RAH4|4.0|This is one I watch at least once a year. The chemistry and comic timing of Simon and Nick is addictive to watch and I love every film they've made. I highly recommend if you want hilarious British humor and great action. There are so many one liners you'll miss unless you watch it more than once! Hilarious fast paced action comedy. It's one to own. Caution-a couple scenes are explicit in terms of victim's demise, so you may need to cover your eyes if you don't want to be grossed out. Excellent cast.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Great story that speaks to everyone's need to experience life to the fullest, even the most disabled among us.<br />Clearly not for kids or younger ones, as they'll get distracted by nudity, but abled and disabled adults will laugh and<br />find the themes universal and sometimes hilarious.
0307744434|5.0|Fantastic journey through a literary work of art.  Soaked up every word like a sponge.  When reading one feels as though they are a live subject in the story.  This is what a book is supposed to do...let one escape and dream.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|It was an easy read and I found it entertaining.  It is certainly no intellectual triumph but it does leave you thinking about the possibility of another dimension.  What I found most useful about the book is that it does provoke questions about values and life priorities.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I am a fan of mostly anything involving Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan. I love all three of the movies and I feel they are the best Batman films that have yet to be made. I cannot wait for Nolan's next masterpiece.
B00867GHS8|5.0|One of my all time favorite films and to have it now..in 3D is amazing. The quality is perfect on the blu-ray dics, the 3D is sooo awesome. My kids love this movie just as much as I do. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone. I talk about it often to my friends and family.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I went to see this movie in the theater with my 14 year old daughter - we both enjoyed the the movie very much.  I'm of the Breakfast Club/ St. Elmo's Fire generation and I believe that this movie will be the &#34;Breakfast Club&#34; of my daughter's generation.
B005C0DHEY|3.0|Pretty one sided, although the documentary claims that this is because no one from the industry would comment. There are rumors that some/many of those households had water issues pre-fracking. Whether that is true or not is the question here. Overall, there is a lot more information that must be examined to determine the pros and cons of our current search for energy independence.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The first half of the novel was riveting.  But then the tables turned, and the plot from then on was  simply preposterous and unbelievable.  I won't give away what happens, but asking the reader to believe that anybody would behave the way the book depicts is incredible to me.  I read the whole thing because it was fast moving and interesting, like a train wreck.  But my attitude reading was like &#34;Are you kidding me?&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a good and fun game once you start to play it you won't be able to put it down it is that good
B004SDEP38|1.0|I could not get this one to do anything i wanted it to. Maybe if I had purchased the app instead of using the free one I would have been happier with it.
0395389496|4.0|This book was giving to my 4 yr old grand daughter for Christmas.  A CD was included with the book so my grand daughter could listen to it all by herself.  The book is beautifully illistrated and the story is magical.  It really gets one in the spirit of Christmas.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I haven`t read a lot of Brandon Sanderson's works but I found this novella quite enjoyable.a small story that keeps one guessing right up to the end.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My daughter and I watched this movie and we enjoyed it very much.  We will definitely be watching this movie again.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I enjoy this very much!<br />I&#34;ve always wanted to play the piano.<br />I&#34;M very happy and its very relaxing to play.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was magical & did everything a perfect book should ~ take us to another place & time ~ leaving us there forgetting our own life!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 keeps me on the edge of my seat. I try my best not to have the man jump over the cliffs.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Pros:<br /><br />Very witty and smart writing<br />A page turner for the twists and turns<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Very hateful book<br />You actually hate the characters equally at different times<br />Very terrible ending<br />Some of the hate made me physically uncomfortable<br />A letdown in the end.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. Some are fairly easy and some are aggravatingly hard! I love love love this game! Plus, it has tons of mini games for you to unlock and enjoy.
B009A87X80|5.0|Eva, thanks for your style and performance. Shortly, no command/scale, just listen the feeling of '.......' . More than my expectation.
B0087X728K|5.0|This is the only thermal paste I use. Sure, there are cheaper and even more expensive brands out there but this has never let me down. Give it a shot!
B000WGWQG8|2.0|Was disappointed; found it boring.  But then I've become addicted to Breaking Bad, fast action/violence/suspense,<br />so this might have spoiled me for John Adams more slow plot development.
B00A03WBVI|5.0|I bought this for my son on his Kindle. He listens to it so much that I can probably sing all the words at this point. If your a One Direction fan, then you will love it too.
1451695195|2.0|Want proof of heaven, believe that a doctor who says he saw the light,  did indeed do so.<br />But the writing is slow and not exciting to me...so read a few pages each day.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|it's ok for a change in reading styles.  I tend to read more intense books and this is a pleasure after one of those.
