B002ZG98PA|4.0|One of the pleasures of watching \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" a year ago was in knowing that Disney was getting back in touch with their roots. They gave us a traditional hand-drawn animated film, a process they had abandoned after the 2004 release of \\"Home on the Range.\\" It was like witnessing a glorious rebirth, the resurrection of a seemingly lost art form. My hope what that it would once again become custom for animated films to be done by hand. It may be painstaking, but can you deny the beautiful results? The backgrounds. The form of the line. The coloring. The lighting. The mattes. Alas, it wasn't to be; for \\"Tangled,\\" Disney has once again discarded pencil and paper for a computer screen. They have also released it in 3D, a cinematic beast that cannot be tamed.    But please, don't get the wrong idea. \\"Tangled\\" is not a bad movie at all. It's funny, sweet, and adventurous, and it's strong in character, story, and theme. And like all the good Disney animated films, hand-drawn or otherwise, it puts a refreshingly modern twist on a classic fairy tale, \\"Rapunzel\\" in this case. It also employs a major talent that \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" would have greatly benefited from: Composer Alan Menken, who - along with lyricists such as Tim Rice, Stephen Schwartz, and the late Howard Ashman - was a key figure of the Disney Renaissance, having composed such memorable tunes as \\"Be Our Guest,\\" \\"Under the Sea,\\" and \\"Colors of the Wind.\\" His ear for melody compliments Disney so well, it's almost a shame it isn't like it was in the Golden Age of Hollywood, when cast and crew were contractually obligated to work for a specific studio.    \\"Tangled\\" begins with the story of a golden flower that sprouted when a drop of sunshine fell to Earth. It glowed like fire and possessed magical rejuvenating properties when sung to. A vain old crone named Mother Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) depended on it to continuously restore her youth, and so it remained for several centuries until the Queen of the kingdom fell ill while pregnant; upon drinking an elixir made from that golden flower, not only was the Queen brought back to health, she also gave birth to a daughter with magical golden hair. Gothel, desperate to reclaim her immortal good looks, is forced to kidnap the infant princess, since cutting her hair off robs it of its healing powers. And so the princess was raised as Gothel's own in an isolated tower, where she was conditioned to be fearful of the outside world while her hair continued to grow longer and longer and longer.    We meet this princess, the innocent Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore), on the verge of her eighteenth birthday. Although she takes Gothel's lies at face value, she remains curious about an annual event held off in the distant kingdom: The releasing of hundreds of floating lanterns, which Rapunzel has figured out are not stars. Is it a coincidence that this event takes place on her birthday? She would like to find out. Here enters the film's narrator, Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachery Levi), a handsome, smooth-talking bandit who seeks refuge in Rapunzel's tower after robbing the King and the Queen. Upon coming to after being whacked in the head with a frying pan several times, he and Rapunzel strike a deal: If he promises to take her to see the lantern ceremony on her birthday, she promises to return his stolen loot, which she has hidden from him. And so begins Rapunzel's first venture away from home, a journey that will include chases, encounters, escapes, revelations, and yes, even romance.    It's traditional for an animated film to feature supporting players that are funnier and more memorable than the protagonists. \\"Tangled\\" provides us with several such characters, including Rapunzel's pet chameleon, Pascal, and a royal horse named Maximus, who has the nose of dog, the reflexes of a cat, and - when in the presence of Flynn - the personality of a mean older brother. We're also given a number of pub-crawling thugs who secretly harbor sentimental hopes and dreams. One of them, voiced by Brad Garrett, has always wanted to be a concert pianist, despite having a hook for a hand. Inspired by Rapunzel's innocence, they all reveal their desires during the film's best song, a hilarious showstopper called \\"I Got a Dream.\\"    \\"Tangled\\" is, in short, a pleasant, entertaining, competent animated film, a decent addition to the Disney animated-feature canon. Even so, I would have preferred to once again watch a traditional cel animated film. Perhaps I'm remember with longing the days of glorious labor-intensive productions like \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\\" and classics like \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\\" \\"Pinocchio,\\" and \\"Sleeping Beauty.\\" Simply looking at these movies is an experience unto themselves. I also think that the film's original title of \\"Rapunzel\\" would not have altered its success in any way, despite Disney's belief that \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" lost out on a potential viewership of young boys. Forget about marketing and demographics - just focus on the story.
B0042RUMEQ|4.0|I think the album was good. The flow of the songs ... was not great. You dont have to be a die-hard NICKI MINAJ fan, to appreciate it. There are a few songs like \\"Did It On Em\\" that might be a bit \\"confusing\\" to people that don't know her journey. But anyways.... Moment 4 Life (feat Drake), Fly (feat Rihanna), Last Chance (feat. Natasha B.) Im the Best are ALL GOOD SONGS. No arguing that. The MP3 is only $5.00, so just BUY IT!!! Lol.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|The music industry has been so filled with manufactured pop, miserable post-grunge tripe and talentless hip-hop that trades raw emotion for slick commercialism that this excellent hard-rockin' trip came as a welcome relief. What is even more shocking is that it is made by a band that I am not too crazy about it, a band in which I felt made a couple of good songs and numerous filler. Sometimes, being proven wrong on rather this band is worth anything is a good thing and, in the case of DANGER DAYS, it is a pleasure.<br /><br />BLACK PARADE showed MCR's aspirations of crossing Queen, Iron Maiden, Black Flag and Pink Floyd. Here, MCR replaces Gothic rock with metallic power pop and techno-infused rock n' roll that recalls Cheap Trick, the Jam, the Stooges, the Sex Pistols, Depeche Mode, Happy Mondays, Jane's Addiction, the Buzzcocks and numerous anti-Reagan punk rock bands. Not only do MCR sound different; they have also changed their image as comic-book heroes and sci-fi geeks, a strong contrast to the black-and-white look of their early albums.<br /><br />But this change of image isn't just a gimmick; it is an effective way to help MCR liberate their music and do whatever they want with their songs. BLACK PARADE, for all its virtues, felt conservative, as if MCR were restrained by their image as members of the black parade. DANGER DAYS, on the other hand, sounds looser, less restraining and more vibrant. As a result, they have crafted an album that is enjoyable and at same time yields many rewards upon numerous listens.<br /><br />There are an overabundance of irresistible hooks, riffs, guitar solos and melodies that make this album worth a trip and there are number of terrific songs that rival the best of Green Day, Foo Fighters and Pearl Jam. These songs include the annoyingly catchy \\"Na Na Na Na Na Na...\\", the disco-flavored tonic \\"Planetary\\", the dizzying cascade of \\"Sing\\" and the pummeling rockers \\"Party Poison\\", \\"Destroya\\" and \\"Vampire Money\\". There is a sweet, Beatlesque pop tune \\"Summertime\\" and a stab at Achtung Baby-era U2 in \\"The Kids from Yesterday\\", which sounds like a cross between \\"Discotheque\\", \\"Ultra Violet (Light My Way)\\" and \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close)\\". Each of these songs sound distinctive and different yet are endlessly melodic and get better upon each listen.<br /><br />The general theme of the album calls for a revolution against the corporate \\"pigs\\" that are demoralizing the music industry. It is a breath of fresh air that we have an album whose sentiments and music are actually genuine. MCR has successfully distant themselves from the talentless, grotesquely overvalued post-grunge rock bands who prize sales charts over an encompassing ambition. DANGER DAYS is a terrific rock record and an injection of adrenaline for anyone sickened by today's redundant pop and rock music. It is not only one of the year's grandest albums; it is an album cements MCR as one of the most exciting and interesting rock bands in recent memory.<br /><br />Finally, a rock band with talent and ambition!

B003XQM2YU|3.0|Why three stars, & not two? Really, because I have come to expect nothing more from Hollywood. I paid 99 cents to rent this for two days. I seriously doubt I'll watch it a second time. This film has many problems: Conflicting sub-plots & conflicting character portrayals are but two of them. The real killer is the Normandy beach invasion. They stole virtually everything but the lines from the opening scenes of Ryan. Higgins boats that defy all known laws of physics... I was howling watching that. Russell Crow played his only main character: Gladiator/Lucky Jack/& now Robin Hood. So what? This film didn't do well in the box office because of this. Russell is capable of acting. I've seen films where he does a good job of playing different characters. It's a poor reflection on him to keep taking these same parts. Not_fer_nuttin, but he has already poorly reflected upon himself enough over the years... I paid 99 cents for the imagery. I usually don't write spoilers. This pic is so predictably bad, though. That, in this case. I don't give it the respect of not doing so. Thanks for letting me watch it cheaply, Amazon.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|It'll break your heart, a tragic love story. I found I was angry after watching it, I think because it's a story about love wasted. Ennis can't love Jack openly because of the man his father showed him when he was a boy who was murdered because he was gay, but who's to say that that man wouldn't have said that however much time he had with his lover wasn't worth any price? Anyway, glorious scenery, and Heath Ledger is just amazing as Ennis, there were times when I thought he was going to literally break on camera he was in so much pain.
B004BSAHLY|5.0|Simply put, this is a sonic assault on your ears! Kanye's range and creativity with this album is second to none. The tracks vary from hardcore to R&B to rock to pop to how-in-the-heck-do-you-describe-this...he pretty much leaves no stone unturned. If you're a fan of the newer generation of hip hop, this probably isn't for you, but to the seasoned, mature, hip hop heads (like myself), it should come across as a masterpiece...
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Writing, directing, editing, photography, and especially acting all superb in the series about a high school chemistry teacher whose 40-year old wife is 7 months pregnant with a surprise baby, whose 16-year old son has cerebral palsy, and who has just been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer.  What happens when someone like that is told he has 18 months to live?<br /><br />Well, Walt goes on a ridealong with his DEA brother-in-law to bust a meth lab, and as the bust is going down, sees what was inarguably his worst student ever climbing out of the window of the house next door, where the ex-student been screwing the neighbor while his meth cooks.  Later, his ex-student answers a knock at the door.  It's Walt, who says, \\"Let's cook.\\"<br /><br />And that, folks, is just the first episode.  The series is an amazing exploration into the morally liberating effect having no hope can have on the human psyche, an almost documentary look at a slow, incremental descent into evil, and a cautionary note on the violence that can lurk beneath the surface of what appears to be the mildest of men. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are perfect foils. This may be the best buddy series ever.
0553212478|1.0|I ORDERED THIS BOOK FOR A CLASS. AND WHEN I RECIEVED THE BOOK IT WAS THE WRONG VERSION WHEN IT WAS CLEARLY ADVERTISED AS THE CORRECT ITEM!!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!
B000YRY8BG|5.0|Best journalism movie since [[ASIN:B000CEXEWA All the President's Men (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], and Bill Nighy is perfect and fabulous as the managing editor.
B003L20IJM|5.0|Children love this movie and it's interesting enough for adults too. Could be a great 'chick flix' with the romance & happy ending.
B001DDBCUA|2.0|I've only seen the series on hotel televisions late at night, but even those few eps that I've seen seemed much smarter and funnier than this film. I actually dozed off about halfway through.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|A splendid recording chock full of humanity.This along with Jonatha Brooke's \\"The Works\\" may be my favourite recordings of the last few years.Moreover,I would love to hear June Tabor (the fine English chanteuse) and Natalie Merchant work/record  in tandem.I could think of no more suitable pairing.
B000XA5K48|3.0|A cartoon adventure, but it does have Clive Owen (drool) and Paul Giamatti makes a great bad guy. There is great amusement to be had in how many guns go off and how many people don't get shot.
B0012GMUIG|5.0|I bought this Album yes L.P. when i was a teen, I love this Album easily my Favorite Billy Joel Record Need to get it on CD now
B0013FXWU6|1.0|I love Daniel Day-Lewis, I think he walks on water when it comes to inhabiting a character (Hawkeye in Last of the Mohicans, Cyril in Room With a View), but I hated this film. Nihilistic, depressing, it reminded me of those awful films in the 60s and 70s like \\"They Shoot Horses Don't They?\\" where it's just everybody losing everywhere you look, no laughter, no love, no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I see why Lewis got the Oscar for the role, but the man he portrayed is not anyone I wanted to spend five minutes with (or $10 on), let alone two hours.
B001UREJWM|5.0|Its Dio/Sabbath! He was always the better vocalist than Ozzy. Sadly, Ronnie passed away shortly after this album and tour. Best song on this one is Eating the Cannibals. Buy it!
B000YAA68C|4.0|I was surprised how much I liked this movie. Most of it is pretty predictable and not a little sappy (sorry, praising with faint d**ns), but the way Butler guides Swank through their history (backwards) and her grief is kind of sweet and maybe even a little clever. The supporting cast is good, especially Connick and Kudrow, and of course it doesn't hurt that what we see of Ireland is drop-dead gorgeous.
B00493AD74|2.0|Why, oh why, did so many ladies sing the praise of this book and movie?  Do I really know that many stupid, dull women?  This movie was so lacking in story depth, character (which I understand is what the character was lacking in the beginning, but still!).  Sure, it was visually appealing - which is why I gave it 2 stars.  If I'd stayed longer for the male rear nudity, maybe it would have gotten 3 stars but I doubt it.  After 12 minutes in my daughter and I already wanted to turn it off.  And just over and hour we couldn't take it anymore.  I think maybe you had to have read the book first to have bonded with the main character.  Alas, this movie was made without realizing that most of their audience did not read the book first and we were not going to simply love the movie because Julia Roberts was in it.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|This is an answer to my prayers.  I wish the stuffed animal was a little heavier to stay in place on my babies chest.  The soothie paci is sewn to the animal so once it wears out you'll need to buy another one.  I thought the stuffed animal clipped onto the paci.  But I still love it!
B001IL1AMW|5.0|I enjoyed this episode because of the emerging Lois and Clark romance.  I had a problem with maybe a couple of things, but the Lois and Clark interaction over-rides my criticism.  It is actually in this episode that you find out for sure what Lois feels for Clark...so...how can this be, in any way, a disappointment.  And it was done in such a way that the revelation was a real struggle to let out.  The frst time you see this epi the revelation is a complete surprise...a surprise in that they revealed her feelings at this point in the series.  I think the banter between Lois and Clark is wonderful and the growing romance and the maturity I see in Clark Kent is why I watch.
0525457585|4.0|I don't think I can say anything that no one else has said - the first half of the book was good, the second half was boring.  It should have been split into two novels, with the second part being more developed.
B004B8RXQQ|1.0|Yegods, how awful.  If you want to see Holmes well done, jut watch the Granada series with Jeremy Brett.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|If you would like a book that you can really get lost in, this is the one.  I cannot wait for the second part.  I was not happy about the price like everybody else, but that is not reason to review the book based on price.  It took me a little while to spend that, but then I saw the hardcover at the big box stores and it was the same price.  That's what made me decide to buy the Kindle version because than I can carry it with me anywhere.  Go ahead and treat yourself.  You will not be sorry.
B003IWRE3I|2.0|I thought this movie was good when I watched the 2 minute preview using my Roku box but that was very misleading. The movie is very long and depressing and I never could follow the plot. All I could figure out was a family where the wife died and the father and son tries to stay alive and that's about it. They run into some weird people but that's about it. No gory stuff, walking dead or anything like that. Maybe the book fills in parts that are needed to understand it.<br /><br />If you are looking for a action movie this isn't it.
B0001XAPZ6|3.0|i read Naushika in Animegie (i am not sure this mazagine still exists.  it was like late 70s or early 80s.)  when they decided to make a movie out of the comics, even i was a child, it seemed really odd timing because the story was only in the beginning (the second or third book, i believe the sixth or seventh is the last one).  so i thought it would be a series of Naushika movies because when i went to the openning of the movie, it was an obvious unfinished work.  many ppl felt the same way.  i was not sure the intention of Mr. Miyazaki or the sponsor (tokuma shoten), but it was not the best work of Mr. Miyazaki for sure.    i like \\"mirai shonen conan\\" (this is not the conan you are thinking about, NHK anime from 70s) or even \\"alpes no shojo heidi\\", Mr. Miyazaki's old work, but Naushika movie was a bit disappointment even for a child.
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|First off, there are no spoilers in this review, just my thoughts.    As soon as this movie started I knew I was in for a gem. Right away I felt connected to the main characters and had a strong sense of how they were feeling. The plot was amazing, and I the thought the character development was a strong point. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and when it was over my reaction was WOW!!!!!      For any price, this movie is a must hown for any movie buff or even the toughest critic.
B003E6K1VK|2.0|I've owned all of fiio's other products in hope that they are better than the ipod's amp. They're all the same. Using line out, this is barely better than the integrated amp. Other amps like the the meier xxs or iBasso t3 cost more but have a noticeable improvement over this. With a low cost, the companies can only make so much. Add more features and you're taking away from the amp. Bass boost is not recommended, on any portable amp, but more so on this one. Sure the T3 also has a bass boost but at least it doesn't trash the sound.    Either buy a good amp or none at all, the cost of buying it and carrying it around is no where near worth the possible benefit or loss, unless you're a gear whore and you like the extra weight. Portable amps are usually decent value for money at best, but this is like buying a pretty, expensive bracelet for your rig.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Josh has grown so much in the few years he's been in the spotlight.  I am glad that he is singing more in English. On this latest release he not only shows off his vocals and piano playing, but he's also co-written much of the music and lyrics -- even the foreign language ones-- proving that Josh is more than just a guy who can carry a tune. He is a composer of the finest order.
B0043URV8M|5.0|I loved Alexander Desplat's music for this movie.     A lot of critique about this soundtrack has come about because of the lack of Hedwig's Theme. Yes, I was disappointed with the lack of a Hedwig's Theme-like track, but I find it okay that it wasn't there. After all this movie was completely different from older movies (it's not just in Hogwarts like previous ones), so the soundtrack can be different too. However, I feel the second part should have more Hedwig's Theme references. Hedwig's Theme reminds me of Hogwarts, so I don't think it would fit.     I feel Desplat's score for this movie was incredible. It was dark, haunting in the right places and it's a pleasure to listen to while I'm working, reading or writing something. I especially like the first two tracks- Obliviate and Snape to Malfoy Manor. Both tracks complement the film perfectly, and after all, the soundtrack is written for that purpose. But it's also nice to listen it alone. The Ministry of Magic theme really makes me think of the Ministry of Magic. Farewell to Dobby really was a sad piece, and it also reminded me of Obliviate, making it nice too, because Obliviate starts the movie and Farewell to Dobby is at the end.     The movie's tone and the soundtrack go well together, making this soundtrack really good.    Note: About the attacks on Desplat himself: It's not really relevant what Desplat's character is, and how people conclude that he has a big ego from this music doesn't make sense to me. The director has a say in the soundtrack, so it's not like Yates didn't like this at all, or else he would have done something about it. Hedwig's Theme was included in Polyjuice Potion anyway, albeit a small part. I really think it's okay for Hedwig's Theme not to be included that much. What would be irritating is if it was not included in Part 2's soundtrack.

HOWEVER they appear on the screen in a small \\"postcard\\" format! A small box in the middle of the screen surrounded by 4 black bars! Not 2...but 4!<br />Not gonna lie, this is a really crappy way to watch MJs music videos.. all of his previous releases were in 4:3 but were formatted to fit the screen. On my DVD player in the living room I had to continuously change the setting to 'fit the screen' which was annoying but I could deal with it. On my player in the bedroom I have no such feature so I am stuck with watching it as a small square in the screen!<br /><br />2) Remastered?<br />Some of these videos look amazing and I will give credit where credit is due.. \\"Black or White\\" in particular looks the best I have EVER seen it! So does \\"Smooth Criminal\\" and \\"Don't Stop Til' You Get Enough\\"..but some videos still look like pure crap! Namely \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Beat It\\", \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" and \\"Will You Be There\\"...the transfer is grainy, fuzzy, blurry and VHS like! This proves to me they couldn't salvage this footage at all to qualify a Blu-Ray high definition release. But most of the videos look halfway decent and as I said some videos really shine so I can look past this more than I can with the widescreen issue.<br /><br />3) Inclusion/Removal of videos?<br />My main issue is with the \\"Blood On The Dance Floor\\" video..why the hell did they include the lame remix?

B000FA5TTW|4.0|Written with such description that, at times, it takes your breath away.  Starts tragically, but proceeds with such charm and insight.  Susie's way of \\"letting go\\" - insightful, charming and tearful.  Having been through major deaths in my lifetime, it's okay to hold on and always \\"see\\" the deceased, but it's also okay to let go and move on - not forget, but just to move on.  Have a nice life.
B002ZG9846|5.0|A large amount of the 1 star reviews are from people who think the movie was way to violent for kids and took offence with the content of the film. First off it is rated R and therefore children or young teens should not be watching it. Parents should look at the rating thats why its there not just buy a movie expecting that because its about super heroes it is kid friendly. Secondly, people take issue with the amount of violence and harsh language used in the film. The movie is called Kickass I don't see how they didn't expect cursing and violence when the title lays out the tone of the film. There are also a fair number of complaints that the patents of the actress who played hit girl being bad parents for allowing her to do this movie. However you believe a child should or should not be raised has no effect on the quality of the film.  As for hit girls cursing and violence curse words are just words  and she never killed or hurt anyone, she did staged fights and green screen work. I happen to think this was a very well directed film with an amazing script,special effects team and a great cast.
031603438X|5.0|I have waited years for this tale and I was not disappointed. I read this book cover to cover in 2 days! Keith holds nothing back and I found myself chuckling frequently while reading, causing my kids to give me curious looks! Keith is nothing if not amusing and sometimes brutally honest. I enjoyed most reading of his time with Anita Pallenberg as it is so hard to find truthful information about them in various other books. And I'm glad Keith put to rest numerous rumours that have circulated for years. It was also very satisfying to hear from Keith's son Marlon, too, concerning his upbringing, which was, to say the least, unconventional. To sum it up, go buy this book, you will not regret it. It is a truly amazing story of a truly amazing music legend. And I'm sure Mick Jagger turned several shades of red while reading this, if in fact he has read it!

I was not sure I would like it because it is non-fiction, but Skloot does such a great job of spinning an incredible tale. Her writing takes you back in time and is equally effective at evoking rural Virginia as the bustling research community at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. She never loses site of the true heart of the story, Henrietta Lacks and her descendants.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|I ordered this \\"new\\" DVD for the holidays, along with four others.  This particular DVD was rattling when it arrived -- obviously something inside was broken.  The DVD packaging/holder was damaged inside (the actual DVD was intact), leading me to wonder how can something that is \\"new\\" be damaged before it is even opened?  The UPS shipping package was not damaged nor were the other four DVDs -- clearly this is a problem with the particular seller.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|Worst thing I have ever seen. I struggled to stay awake in the middle of the morning. I was doing the math after 15 minutes to figure out when it would end. I was laughing out loud the last 10 minutes.  If I could I would rate it -5 stars. I can't believe this ever got a distributor.
B004A6MKN0|1.0|This is the first time I've given up on an audio book because the narration was so poor.  I really enjoyed Heat Wave (the print version), but when I tried listening to Naked Heat, I could not get past the first CD - the reader was not engaging and his inflection consistently felt wrong given the words he was saying.  I still plan to read this book, because the words sounded interesting, but the narration on this is simply unbearable - glad I got it from the library, and didn't buy it.
B00001U0DP|2.0|The movie itself was great, the quality as the seller described was bad. It has scratches and skips on the best part of the whole movie.
0380820846|5.0|I loved loved LOVED THIS BOOK!!! The story is such a delight and the romance between Colin and Penelope was so touching, it left a smile on my face after every chapter. The Bridgerton family is one of my newest favorite series and each book just keeps getting better and better. And Lady Whistledown!!!! I was definitely surprised to find out who was behind the column.<br /><br />Please please please ignore ALL the poor reviews!!! This book MUST be read AFTER you have read these three books first: The Duke and I, The Viscount Who Loved Me, and An Offer from a Gentleman. I would highly recommend being very acquainted with them before diving into this book. I'M SO GLAD I DID!!!<br /><br />If you have enjoyed the first three novels, then you will LOVE this book!!!

B0034G4OUO|3.0|This movie has The Rock in it, so that alone makes it worthy to watch...  He does a good job in his acting role, even though he does not talk alot in it...  He also looks the part, with his awesome buff body...    However, this movie could have been a lot better!    Simply put, there just wasn't enough action! As the previous reviewer stated, The Rock mostly skates through the movie Mad, Distraught, and the actions scenes are decent at best. When there is action, anyway...    Also agreeing with the previous reviewer, I think this is the right type of movie for The Rock to be in, but there needs to be more content, action & more of The Rock kicking butt!  The Rock needs to do more Jason Stathem type of movies... A LOT MORE ACTION...    The Car that The Rock drives in the movie ROCKS!!!!!!!! I want one just like it...    I would recommend waiting for the DVD release...        Thanks

B000001Y5J|5.0|Nine Inch Nails has grown a lot since Pretty Hate Machine, but that ggrowth does not discount what has been done previously. If you want to see just how true that is, check out this little piece of industrial bliss that came afterword and that, in my opinion, was one of the many highpoints in NIN's career. Here, NIN took an EP and turned it into a really superb album, een hiding tracks on it to make the beast better. The hidden ones are my favorites, too, because it wwas hard to find them when this first came out. Tapes, Happiness in slavery; there are just some moments that are too beautiful.<br /><br />When checking this album out, listen to the growth that the band shows between this and PHM. You can see the dawning of the new day that is coming, and you can see the Spiral forming. I suppose thta is another reason to like it - as a lot of bands competed over who could have the highest BPM on their albums, NIN was simply putting out good music. Sometimes that meant playing with the tempo, sometimes that meant adding a little bit of rage, and sometimes that smply meant focusing on the vocals. Regardless, I love this album and return to it quite a bit, knowing that it is one of those things that has lived way past the place where other bands would have gone to die.<br /><br />If you know NIN now, know it from here. If you are afan, I am simply talking to you because you already know. Regardless, this is a solid 5 and is worth getting. Even if you don't like the newer stuff, play here. You'll like this audio sandbox.
B0039UTDA6|5.0|I thought this series was one of the best I've ever seen on television, and while I'm not an Oprah fan, I thought she did a fantastic job and really do not understand all the negativity with her narration.  This DVD will make wonderful Christmas gifts.  I wish every family could see this.

B0038BBA4I|5.0|I've been buying music from amazon for years, yet this is my first review. I haven't loved an ENTIRE album like this in a long time. Their lyrics are genius! I'm mostly into alternative rock, and although this wouldn't typically be my type of music, I love how unique it is...blue-grassy, dave-matthews sounding...if you're all about lyrics than this is a very good album to listen to. Awesome, awesome, awesome.
B002ZG99A4|2.0|\\"The Expendables\\" is just that. I was disappointed with the potential they had and what they delivered.  The plain fact of the matter is this film banks entirely upon the draw of the cast, and doesn't deal with that well. I was left with the impression that they assembled the the stars and created the script around their availablity. Arnold and Bruce Willis are just cameos, and so short at that it could be considered deceptive advertising to place them on the cover shot. Mickey Rourke, one of my favorites, could have been cut out entirely with no loss to the film at all.  The jokes fall flat and the personal drama is confused, scattered in approach and resolution. There's only two scenes between Jason Statham and Charisma Carpentar yet we keep hearing about it. Jet Li's character needs a raise, we don't know why and after a point if it's supposed to be funny you are just lost trying to understand and the humor goes past.  The bulk of the action sequences seemed to be put in by cookie cutter editing. \\"Ten minutes has gone past, we need a car chase here\\". This film doesn't flow, it's like being stuck in a manually shifting car with someone who doesn't know how to work the clutch.  \\"The Expendables\\" is an object lesson in \\"less is more\\". They could have cut out a lot of the mess and had a far better movie.  I gave it an additional star for the end sequence, which was pretty spectacular. That's the only reason why it's even a rental.  I made the great mistake of buying this film. It's a lesson learned in seeing it on pay per view first.
B003VDZWAQ|4.0|Sorry to say but the pilot episode of Haven was just awful.  I'm not really sure why I kept tuning in to watch the subsequent episodes, but I'm glad I did.  As the season progressed, the show significantly improved.  So, watch this episode keeping in mind that things will get better - Not in Haven, mind you, where things will deteriorate up to the dramatic conclusion of season 1.  Can't wait to see what happens in Season 2.<br />**Update - Now that we've made it through season 3 of Haven, it's really developed into a great, intriguing show.  I'm glad it has stuck around.
0517548232|5.0|Economics in One Lesson should be required reading for anyone who wants to know todays most common economic fallacies that are being pushed today. Was simply a breath of fresh air, I couldn't put it down. This book is not about politics, the reviewers that say it is only say so because their party believes these destructive economic fallacies.
B00445JSX2|3.0|I was baffled when it wasn't performed at most of the live shows, but I am shocked that it is not on this DVD.  I used to collect depeche mode.  However, due to mass commercialization of their material I had to quit.  I generally by their DVDs when I see them, but since \\"In Sympathy\\" is not on it, this will be the first I pass on.  Am I wrong to say that \\"In Sympathy\\" is one of the two best songs on Sounds of the Universe?

B002VPE1B6|4.0|*** WARNING!*** Possible spoilers for two excellent movies follow:<br /><br />I haven't had the heart to write the review that reflected my impression to watching this admittedly impressive film a year ago.<br /><br />You couldn't miss the hype if you owned a television - I was an American serviceman stationed overseas and I knew well that it was a movie that featured exotic blue people, and people like Roger Ebert were giving the film the highest praise.<br /><br />I paid my 2000 yen to watch the film in a theatre with kanji subtitles playing beneath the original English soundtrack.  I was ready to be DAZZLED.<br /><br />The film started.... I started to be dazzled... Then, about thirty minutes into it I started thinking \\"hey... WAIT a MINUTE!\\"<br /><br />There was an absolutely excellent film.  It won seven Academy Awards, including Best Film, and was nominated for five others. ***HERE COME THE SPOILERS***  In this film a young soldier is injured, then sent to a remote location near mysterious indigenous people.  The healing soldier is assigned to infiltrate the indigenous people - to spy on them and report back to headquarters his findings.  But the soldier instead finds the indigenous people fascinating and in his attempts to infiltrate them he instead begins to find the indigenous people and their in-harmony-with-nature lifestyle superior to the life he had been living previously.  He joins the tribe and becomes one of their leaders and protectors, eventually coming into conflict with his original culture - those who sent him - as he defends his new culture.<br /><br />Of course the movie I'm describing is Kevin Costner's masterpiece \\"Dances with Wolves\\", and although James Cameron's \\"Avatar\\" is visually stunning, its plot is utterly stolen from the earlier film.  How was THAT information not passed in the maelstrom of hype that compelled me to plunk down my 2000 yen?  I would have been mentally and emotionally much more forgiving.<br /><br />\\"It's `Dances with Wolves' in outer space with Blue natives\\", someone could have alerted me, and I'd have gone into the film with a different expectation.

But if you plagiarize, and I KNOW you're plagiarizing and you didn't fess up beforehand... it's unsettling.  Theft of intellectual property is a big thing.<br /><br />If \\"Dances\\" had never existed, and \\"Avatar\\" suddenly appeared, I would have liked it as well as Roger Ebert.  The visuals ARE dazzling.  The story certainly IS a unique re-interpretation of the previous movie.  The CGI effects make you believe the nine-feet-tall Na'vi scamper through the exotic forests and ride dragons.  Excellent acting from Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang and Giovanni Ribisi are on display.<br /><br />But when I hear that a movie is \\"original\\" one of the most important things that I expect to be original is the plot, and thirty minutes into this film I knew every scene that would follow.

044654759X|5.0|Unlike some of the more recent Sparks books, which were compelling but still basically sad, this book shows the ability of a terrified, frightened, but still very courageous woman to escape her abuser and move to a new life in a small, peaceful southern town.  The story revolves around her distrust of everyone until she slowly, eventually becomes part of the loving but lonely home of a single father and his two beautiful young children.  As the book progresses, the heroine changes and slowly begins to let go of some of her ever-present fear.  That is, until the worst actually happens and her just-forming family is in serious danger, as is her survival in the new way of life she is just beginning to be able to see for herself.  Much more action and just plain terror than I have ever seen in his books before, and with just a few shivers provided by an unlikely mysterious friend.
0385533829|1.0|Dan Brown has a problem to come up with his own coherent story, unless he has help from others as in the Da Vinci code, for instance. Bottom line: This is one of the most frustrating, incoherent and mind numbing pieces of writing I have had the misfortune to suffer through. It is pretentious and serving the appetite of those who would just love to know more about the Masons. A totally tattooed villain? Please! The entire story line is an insult. It smacks of an author who is running out of gas and is still living on his past success. Nuff said.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|Mumford and Sons have a really unique sound; it's certainly English folk, but it has a little contemporary and maybe a Gospel flavor to it.  They really go back to the folk tradition in the expression of life's constant difficulty.  Sensitive listeners ought to take note they hold nothing back and there is swearing and use of the F word.  Also on a side note, the case is recyclable, but the plastic disk holding portion is rather hard, so it's hard to get the disk out.  You might want to keep it in a separate case if you aren't planning on immediately ripping it.        All in all, this is some great stuff from a very promising indie band.  The CD is very comprehensive and has all their hit songs, which are very catchy I might add.  Oh, and great value too.
B0042RUMJG|5.0|Hands down... this concert, recording, cinematography and video quality is a MUST have for any Sting fan.  Really well captured.

B003E8AF5U|5.0|Unlike many other fans, I discovered MGMT through this second album, and then was redirected to their much more popular first album. I cannot say there is any song in Congratulations better than A Time to Pretend and Kids as a single, but as an album, Congratulations is way more consistent and consolidated work than Oracular Spectacular. But, my true point is, this is the band that can produce these two albums of different directions. I'm surprised and happy that a band appearing in this century can create that kind of wide variety of music in a comparably short period of time. I can only remember such diversity in virtuosity only from the legendary bands from the 60s such as the Beatles and the Beach Boys. Am I being too optimistic if I say I am witnessing the future of rock is growing within MGMT?
B004BC7MRM|5.0|Kid Rock's voice continues to be powerful, now his music allows his voice to come out, and the lyrics are great!!
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|I didn't even buy this album but I did listen to some of the samples just to see what Nikki put out that she thought was Hip-Hop and I must say this is totally...HOT GARBAGE hot & steaming off the garbage truck. And this is suppose to be the new face of female rap & Hip-Hop? The is album is a disgrace to Hip-Hop culture & the female MC's who paved the road to get at the point that Nikki has gotten to.     I remember watching some of her work on youtube before she got with Wayne & the Young Money label and she seem to have a lot of potential but still needed work on her craft at the time. But the minute she signed with Young Money she started selling out to the mainstream and making these little wack disposable songs that probably nobody will remember 5 or 10 yrs from now. And I find it amazing that you got 17, 18, & 20+ yr old women (and some dudes) buying this garbage and it's projected to sell 400-500k+ in the first week? But serious artists like Lloyd Banks, Big Boi, or Nas can't even sell or the stores will only put a few copies in the CD shelves or not put them up at all.     Y'all can call me a disgruntled rap fan or old head but I would like to know what is so special about her music b/c see has nothing on this album that of substance if not relevance and I wouldn't be surprised if her next album doesn't sell as half as what she sold this time around hell, Nikki might not even be remembered in the next 5 years if she continues to put out garbage like this she won't be around very long but if one thing is for sure in my opinion, I don't think anyone will be taking mainstream female rappers serious for a good while and you have Nikki to thank for that. And for the guy that said, \\"We owe Nas $10 b/c Hip-Hop is dead\\" well you can add me to the list.

B002ZG999U|3.0|The Expendables has some of my favorite action stars together in one movie. I mean, there's one scene where Sylvester Stallone, Arnold, and Bruce Willis on screen together and it was just exciting to see. And there is a lot of action in this one, but it really isn't anything we haven't seen before. It's basically Rambo all over again, only with a far better cast. The first hour has way too much dialogue, which wouldn't be a problem if it were really good dialogue. But it isn't. And that's what made 80's action movies like Lethal Weapon, Commando, and Predator so great. Not only did they deliver the action-packed goods, but they also had good, interesting, often funny dialogue.<br /><br />The Expendables is worth seeing. Just don't expect the next action classic. I did, and I was a little disappointed.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|I started watching this DVD with some skepticism, but I was won over as the concert progressed. By the end I was enthusiastic, and felt it was probably some of Sting's best live work so far.<br /><br />The first five songs on the DVD appeared to confirm my worst fears. Slow, trudging, seemingly sophisticated but really just tame and domesticated bilge -- that's what I thought. A sexagenarian standing in front of an orchestra delivering smooth and timid rehashings of his old hits. Yawn.<br /><br />Sting started to win me over with \\"Russians\\" -- the only song with the writing credit \\"Sting and Sergei Prokofiev\\". The orchestra didn't follow Prokofiev all that closely, but it was the first time in the show that I sat up and thought they were finally doing something interesting with the orchestra.<br /><br />From there on, the concert seemed to build from strength to strength. The country tunes \\"I Hung My Head\\" and \\"The Cowboy Song\\" -- the latter complete with line dancing band members -- were lively and engaging. \\"Whenever I Say Your Name\\" starts with a terrific violin solo. I started appreciating the rich and sophisticated orchestrations, the nuanced percussion, and the interplay between orchestra and Sting's normal band members.<br /><br />\\"Moon Over Bourbon Street\\" was a real highlight. It received a quirky orchestral workover in a style somewhere between Kurt Weill and Stravinsky -- with Sting taking, to my knowledge, his first theremin solo on stage. There were several creative and original moments like this that made me smile in appreciation and realize that Sting's still got it. Musically speaking, that is -- not just with his tanned, statuesque physique, which I'm sure we are all happy to grant him.<br /><br />The Middle Eastern-flavored \\"Desert Rose\\" was also a major highlight, as was \\"She's Too Good To Me\\", a rocker that works out the string section. Unfortunately, Sting left out \\"Next To You\\", probably my favorite track from his \\"Symphonicities\\" studio album.<br /><br />For most of the concert Sting is instrument-free. There is the occasional guitar (usually a three-quarter sized strapless affair), harmonicas and incidental instruments, and sometimes he's slapping away at a tambourine on a stand -- but mainly he's just standing there singing. That means he has a lot of room to bring his unique brand of thespianism into his performance. He can be a stilted overactor, but it's still charming and he does it well.<br /><br />A word about the production. This concert was filmed and recorded on 21 September 2010, and I am writing this review just over two months later. That is pretty impressive turnaround. But as I have experienced before on a few Universal Music DVD/CD combos, there are no subtitles on the DVD. Putting song lyrics in subtitles would not have been expensive, and would have significantly improved the product. A disappointing example of penny pinching.<br /><br />The DVD run time is 2 hours 4 minutes. The CD comes in at 1 hour 16 minutes, and was presumably also recorded at the Berlin concert, although the liner notes do not give specifics. The CD has three songs that are not on the DVD -- \\"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You\\", \\"Fields of Gold\\" and \\"Shape of My Heart\\".<br /><br />Despite a few flaws, in the end this is a first-rate concert and highly recommended.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|The story of Hachi is one of extreme loyalty and love by a dog for his master, a college professor.  It's a true story and took place in Japan but this version is American with an American backdrop.  It's a story which all animal lovers will want to see.  There are  many comical parts to the story when Hachi was young and it's very serious and heartbreaking as well as the end nears.  Overall it's a heartwarming story of a man and his dog.    I recommend it VERY highly...

B000LB7G00|2.0|I had high hopes for this product. I do some 3D modeling now and then, and figured a 3D navigational device would be a great help. The product itself is good. It has a great feel with three rotational directions - roll, pitch and yaw - and three motion directions - up-down, left-right and forward-backward. I am sure many will find this to be a wonderful gadget.    My problem was with Poser 8. I downloaded and installed the drivers. That went smoothly enough. I was indeed able to move about in my scenes, looking this way and that, but there was no way to manipulate and item or parameter using the navigator. This seemed to be an obvious feature, but a check of the documentation - such as it is - showed nothing. Still, being able to move my main camera around in the scenes was pretty useful.    Then, as I loaded in more complicated scenes, Poser 8 started to crash randomly and frequently. I installed the various Poser 8 updates and reinstalled the driver with no change in behavior. I undid the installation, the crashes stopped.    I wound up returning the device. I still think it is a pretty neat device and will meet the needs of many other customers, but it doesn't work with my configuration. As always, your mileage may vary.
B00009XNS9|2.0|This truck was gifted to my three-year old son. He broke part of it (the strut that holds up the tipper tray) within two hours. Three weeks later, he pulled the engine off. While I freely admit that he can be rough at times, a toy pitched at young males shouldn't be so flimsily constructed. A cheap Korean-made Bruder look-alike truck we also own is proving to be superior. Having said all this, the detailing is great, it's attractive and my son enjoys playing with it. But if anything else breaks, I'm tossing it in the garbage as I don't want my son growing up thinking that broken toys are normal.
B000096IBI|5.0|\\"City Lights\\" is still my favorite, if for no other reason than its SHEER PERFECTION and glorious, epoch-making (yet subtle) ending, but this is a very close second.  A breezy, fast-paced look at modern times that will make anybody who has ever had a fast-paced job wince and laugh.  I think only the novel \\"A Day In the Life of Ivan Denisovich\\" is better at bringing up unhappy job memories (and that one doesn't make you laugh).  A great double-feature for \\"Office Space.\\"  Chaplin's masterful use of the mostly stationary camera and relaxed editing is on full display here.  The ice-skating, the prison dinner table, the famous assembly line scenes, the reminder to \\"smile,\\" it's all here.  One of those movies to pop in the DVD player for sheer enjoyment.

0525951652|2.0|This book is very interesting for the first 300 pages as we are introduced to a number of characters.  Unfortunately, the book rumbles on for 685 more pages.  The main characters keep running into each other all over the world - Welsh coal mines, Russian villages, Buffalo!!!, WWI battlefields, London, amongst others.  Peasants run into peasants, noblemen run into noblemen, peasants run into noblemen, etc.  If this wasn't silly enough we have these insignificant figures somehow advising world leaders - Lenin, Churchill, Woodrew Wilson, the tsar, the kaiser.  The ultimate in silliness is college friends, one English and the other German, come across each other on a battlefield in France - later the German and an American friend are at the same battle in France.  We have a Welsh earl crossing paths with a peasant from his village multiple times in different parts of the world - oh yes, the earl had impregnated the peasants sister.  I could go on and on with the silliness - I just became more and more angry as I skimmed my way through the last 200 pages.      Oh, if you didn't know - Lenin was saved by a peasant seargent - whose brother left Wales and met the aforementioned earl, then went to Buffalo and met a friend of the earl who went to fight in France and saw a German nobleman fall in battle - who was also a friend of the earl.  Small world.  Oh, I forgot - the German was also married to the sister of the earl.... and it goes on, and on, and on.

030726999X|5.0|I would just like to add my voice to the chorus of praise for these books. I came off of a difficult semester last spring, just wanting something engaging, the sort of thing to suck you out of your life for a while. Of course, the Millennium Trilogy was just hitting then, and what better books are there to do that?<br /><br />One thing that I like about them is the different character of each book. The Girl With a Dragon Tattoo felt like a mystery/thriller, while The Girl Who Played With Fire is more of a thriller, a story of pursuit (on several plot levels). The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, though, is part courtroom drama and part Le Carre-esque psychological puzzle thriller. The action is more inward, less about the chase. I guess the subtly different nature of the books may be frustrating for some readers, who are drawn to one type of plot that fades away in subsequent books. For myself, though, this variety was a part of what kept me reading for 1200 or so pages, and I think that it speaks to the skill that Larsson had as a writer.<br /><br />Whatever the novels are, the plots are satisfying. Especially on The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, Larsson has paced the events outstandingly, has written a focused novel that ties up the loose ends. And most importantly, the ending feels to me to be the right, inevitable ending. These books were a great experience, and I'll probably revisit them in the future.

B002ZG98LO|2.0|First off let me say that I am a big big Predator fan. I went to go see Alien vs Predators 2 in theatres TWICE.  I own two copies of Aliens 2 and one copy of Alien vs Predator. Every time a Predator movie comes out I am the one who suggests we go to watch it.    Having said that, this movie was straight garbage. I think I've watched better movies on the SciFi channel. I mean jeebus f'n christmas, the whole movie is straight plot hole after plot hole. Nothing in it makes any sense: Hmm we're going to travel light years across the galaxy to handpick some dangerous prey and then throw them out over a forest with parachutes that don't necessarily open. I mean seriously, if I have to walk my ass to the supermarket to get eggs and one breaks I'm already pissed. These trained killers of course all speak English even though they're from different countries, one of them of course is packing a mini-gun, the planet which is not even in our solar system has identifiable plant life, and all this is just the first five minutes. The character development is non-existent, whenever anyone dies in the movie you couldn't care less. Lawrence Fishburne's character is nonsense: crazy guy who's smart enough to use the Predator's technology against them wants to start a fire to kill a bunch of people he just saved. Predators use infrared, I mean c'mon really?! for real real? I know 10 year olds that could write better stuff than this movie.     To sum it up, there's no beginning movie goes straight to the non-sensical middle and the ending blows. If you want to waste your money buying this film go ahead but don't say I didn't warn you.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|I love two songs on thousand suns they are waiting for the end and catyalist from Linkin Park ! better sounding album from what I heard in 20 years of my life !

I mean it's like he has 3 different insturmenal melodies  and he mixes tem differenty so he has 13 songs on the album.  The sound is totally boring, has no potential, the lyrics sound  pathetic.  He seriously deserves a Grammy for Most Overrated and Hyped Person in The Music Industry.
0374290024|4.0|Ian Morris' \\"Why The West Rules--For Now\\" is a thrilling read. Morris is an accomplished stylist and his romp through the last fifteen-thousand years of human activity is fun, informative and--with one or two qualifications, explored below--convincing. I would recommend the book to anyone looking for a tour d'horizon of world history and pre-history.     Morris, however, is after bigger game, seeking to bring up to date a debate on the roots of Western leadership. One theory is \\"long term lock-in\\", which would have it that the West was always destined to enjoy primacy and possibly always will. Different examples of this would be Jared Diamond (Guns Germs and Steel, 1997), who made much of geography, in particular the distribution of domesticable plants and animals; or David Landes (The Wealth and Poverty of Nations, 1998), who dwelt on ideas, in particular those arising out of the northwest European enlightenment which encouraged enterprise by rewarding it with lawful property. Alternatively there is the \\"short-term accident\\" view, which would have it that Western primacy is something of an aberration, shortly to be corrected, following Joseph Needham's classic study of Chinese technology, or such more recent works as Martin Jacques' 2009 \\"When China Rules the World\\".    Morris is an archaeologist, so much of what is exciting in the book has to do with recent findings from his discipline. These enable us to learn much, even when records are absent: examples include the incidence of shipwrecks and lead pollution as surrogates for economic activity. Archaeology helps Morris fill in the gaps between the accounts of Diamond, who looks particularly at the period shortly after the ice retreated, and Landes, who instead focussed on just the last few hundred years.     Morris presents his conclusions via some home-grown sums and a trio of beguiling aphorisms. The sums are his own index numbers of human development, which he uses to illustrate the grand sweep of history andprehistory, showing that the West has been consistently ahead except for an interval from c600CE to c1800CE. He attributes this largely to geography, following Diamond. His aphorisms, \\"change is caused by lazy, greedy frightened people looking for easier, more profitable and safer ways to do things\\"; \\"people (in large groups) are all much the same\\"; and \\"each age gets the thought it needs\\" combine to reinforce his determinism, in which ideas and free will count for little.    As for the future primacy of East versus West, Morris cops out. He makes no bones that he expects the East, that is China, to overtake the West, that is the US. But, he says, by then it won't matter. Failing catastrophe (nuclear war, climate change), we will all be so much better off that the problem will dissolve in a more or less unimaginable technological utopia.     By Morris' own account, this won't haul the freight. Even after China overtakes the US on his index numbers, Americans will still be far better off. Morris is not the first to envisage a utopian future but none has so far turned up. As to his determinism, he follows Landes to note that the Chinese state was strong enough to enforce a policy of isolation for the four hundred years after it abandoned intercontinental exploration in the fifteenth century, while the absence of a single European power led to competition and defensible economic and political rights, extending innovation and enterprise. Is it too much to draw conclusions about the rights and wrongs of large versus small states, institutions prizing stability versus competition, or economic and political concessions versus rights? China is still on the wrong side of history by all these measures.     To conclude with an analogy on primacy. Twenty years ago, we were bracing ourselves for Japanese primacy, with innumerable books, articles and even films on the subject. In the event, that gig got cancelled. If I had to, I would bet that so will this one: the prospect of Chinese primacy will founder on an over-strong state which will decline to permit competition or defensible property rights. Morris should know that.
044654146X|5.0|I recently made my first trip to Israel (more on that later), as part of a Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce trade delegation, and in preparation for this trip, I read, among other books, this book, which was originally released just about a year ago.<br /><br />In \\"Start-Up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle\\" (316 pages), co-authors (and brothers-in-law) Saul Singer and Dan Senor examine why it is that Israel has, in proportion to its population of about 7 million people, such an incredible amount of start-up companies. There are more Israeli companies on the NASDAQ than any other country in the world besides the US. Think about that for a minute! The reasons for this phenom are many, including the strong presence of the military, with everyone in the country doing a 2 or 3 year mandatory military service (leading to more mature university students), and of military innovation, which gets transposed to civil applications and then commercialized. Of course the success of the \\"start-up nation\\" has many other explanations, such as the inherent culture of Israelis to question things, a strong sense of self-motivation, etc. In all, I found this book to be an incredible eye-opener, and a must-read book for any business person.<br /><br />During my recent trip to Israel, we had the good fortune of meeting with a number of start-up companies (different from those mentioned in the book) that truly embody what this book is describing. We also had the even better fortune of having Saul Singer as a guest speaker at one of our meetings. Singer couldn't have been more personable, engaging, interesting, and yes, even entertaining. This was my first visit to Israel, and it was, like this book, an eye-opener on many levels. I certainly hope to get back to Israel in the future.
B0013A1T8I|2.0|I saw part of this on TV before I made the purchase, and did not see all of the movie. The design, computer graphics, and sceens are outstanding, but this is not a film for Christiam children. The movie is based on each person having thier own \\"demon\\" who \\"helps them\\", and leeds others to think this is a good thing.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|The case is well designed and fits the Plantronics perfectly.  The magnetic latch securley holds the case closed and automatically sets itself without you having to place it carefully, like some closures that have a latch \\"pin\\".  It is also compact and well made to last for a long time.  I am very pleased with this case.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I have been a fan since she first made her TV appearance on \\"American Bandstand\\"! I've not, however, always been a fan of all of her music as she's evolved and continually changed over the years. However, when I popped this album on, I was taken to a place I can only describe as dance music nirvana. While some of the tracks seem a bit out of place for the overall album, they are all good in their own right right. My favorite is the heart-pumping, bass-driven \\"Heartbeat\\" and the infectious dance track with Pharrell, \\"Candy Shop\\"! Madonna once again proved that she can progress with the times and still kick out songs that will make you want to dance.
B003CNQPNS|3.0|I don't have this on DVD yet but I plan to get it. I just wanted to clear up that this show was not a massive hit as the description claims.It was a flop back then. This was ABC's answer to the massive hit Knight Rider that was airing on NBC. The show was pretty good but had it's problems. Like a motorcycle that could do 300 mph but not fully under control of the driver. The scientist who invented the cycle,and I believe it was played by Joe Regalbuto who later gained fame as Frank on Murphy Brown, was miles away and had most of the control at that point. Heaven help the innocent bystander who would happen to be in the way as he hit the 300 mark. Still it was a fun show and deserved a longer run.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I'm really starting to have a true appreciation for her talent, skills, & musicality. Her music, not just her voice, is excellent for a young woman; and to be a classical pianist, to boot.
B0030MMJ68|5.0|I loved Kate Morton's \\"The House at Riverton\\", and \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" doesn't disappoint either. But be warned, this is quite a hefty read and can get a bit confusing at times with the moving back and forth between different time periods. However, the story is engaging enough that it was a fast read for me.<br /><br />The story begins in 1913 London with a little 4-year-old castaway on board a ship headed for Australia. She waits for a woman, the Authoress, who told her she would be back, but never returns. In Australia, the little girl is taken in by the port master, Hugh O'Connor, and his wife. The girl, Nell has no recollection as to her origins and is raised by the O'Connors as their own. It is only when she turns 21 that Hugh tells her the truth.<br /><br />In 1975, Nell makes her way to England to unearth the mystery of her origins, but setbacks in her life dampen her efforts. It is only much later, in 2005, that Nell's beloved granddaughter, Cassandra, who was pretty much raised by her grandmother finds out that she has inherited a cottage in Cornwall, and makes the long due journey to England to discover about her grandmother's roots.<br /><br />This is very much a story about women and the complexities of their lives. It makes for an engrossing read. There are many themes in this multi-layered story and I was riveted throughout. Fairy tales are seamlessly woven into the narrative and we even have a beloved author of \\"The Secret Garden\\", Frances Hodgson Burnett mentioned in here. \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" was possibly inspired by this classic of children's literature. Personally, I found much more to appreciate in \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" than in \\"The House at Riverton\\" and look forward to more intriguing reads by Kate Morton.
B0043A0PXU|2.0|first off it seems annie lennox has lost some of her singing talent in this album. also as a die hard Annie Lennox fan I am sadded to see her not only do a christmas album, but to sing it as such. I only giving it two stars because she had good intentions by giving money to a charity. but Annie please go back to doing what you do best!
072325804X|5.0|Everything about the order was nothing short of outstanding. A wonderful book where with each story containing beautiful illustrations.   Thank you very much!!!
B003WTE886|5.0|There arent words to describe how much I love this album. It is by far, Taylor's best  album.    Mine- This is not my favorite, I must say. Its about how she loved a guy and her parents had divorced and she was scared he didnt love her. kind of cheesy, but its reeaallly catchy. I find myself singing it all the time.    Sparks Fly- this song is more pop then country, but I love it. it is a great song to dance arounf your room and sing (if youre like me) and just lose it for a little. It has a tone that is really danceable.    Back To December- This is one of my favorites, because she is apoligizing to a guy that she hurt. I love this song because its slow and easy, and you can listen to it anytime, anywhere, and you can use it to calm down.    Speak Now- this is a cheery, upbeat song that can cheer you up and give you hope. Its about a guy whos fiance you dont like, and duh, she tells him marry me! so obviously they run off into the rainbow or whatever. Its very cute.    Mean- yikes. i didnt know she had it in her to write this one. it makes you mad at the guy she writing it to, (but i heard it was about all her haters), and its fast, cocky, and the most country song on the album, in my opinion.    Better Then Revenge- this one is not country at all, in my opinion, and on her lyrics, she really hates this girl who stole her crush. Its fast, truthful, and makes you flinch sometimes. Its clever, lyric wise, and is good for workouts to get you pumped.    The Story Of Us- this one is catchy, and my favorite at the moment, because its so relatable. to me, and lots of other girls out there. its about her and some guy who are in a fight, and instead of talking, they avoid each other. Its just a great, pop country song.    Never Grow Up- She was very insparational in this song. It made me cry, because of its slow tune and beautiful lyrics. Its about growing up, and she is like a big sister in this song.    Enchanted- its definitely pretty, but nothing different. I sing it alot because the chorus sticks in your head. it is not my favorite, though.    Dear John- seven minutes of slow sad love song.... nothing new at all. its basically about john, who broke her heart. Big surprise.    Last Kiss- too slow, but it is really pretty.    Long Live- havent listened to it yet.    innocent- creepy and slow. it rocks. even though she kinda overreacted at the kanye west thing.    basically, the little flaws aside, this album is awesome. for guys and girls any age. its comfort music, its catchy, its fast, slow, and so much more. Buy it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a great start to a great trilogy! The author created interesting characters that drew you in from the first chapter, and immediately started developing them into dynamic people you loved, hated, or were desperately curious about. Though set in the future, the fact that much of society has fallen into ruin means that the main character's home in rural Appalachia is identifiable to many readers. Elements of Greek history and mythology are readily apparent to those familiar with them, and are woven seamlessly into great scenes of romance, battle, and political conspiracies. The novel is exciting and almost drags the reader from page to page through well-written and thrilling (though bloody and graphic) sequences, but truly connects with the reader in the moments that explore how friendship and love are born, sustained, and perhaps even lost. This is a book that will have you on the edge of your seat, and loving every moment of it - even, dare I say it, the second time around!
B0036TGSIK|5.0|You know that one film that you watch and, even though you know it's not a film that will win awards, the film becomes your favorite? That one movie that delights and entertains you beyond what is reasonable? A movie that you wouldn't grow tired of seeing a hundred times? A movie that picks you up when you are feeling down and makes you realize that you are having fun?     \\"Easy A\\" is precisely that film.     It isn't the best movie you will ever see, but it is a solid film, with a nearly pitch-perfect script and a superb cast (Emma Stone is outstanding and can hold her own in the company of Patricia Clarkson, Stanley Tucci, Lisa Kudrow, and Malcolm McDowell).     This in one high school movie that portrays the annals of high school as much as makes fun of all the pretenses of high school.     The film scores a well-earned \\"A\\" (pun intended).
B003XSSR4W|4.0|For me, this is the most important remaster of the year. And while I really don't care for their other albums, I have a BIG soft spot in my heart for this one. I classify it as one of the best albums of the early 70's.<br /><br />George Harrison took a personal interest in Badfinger, and he oversaw the making of Straight Up. As such, Harrison rejected the first effort, produced by Geoff Eremick, and it was shelved. The final production that George Harrison initiated, and handed over to Todd Rundgren to complete, suited this material quite well. Also, George's slide guitar playing perfectly compliments a few of the tracks.<br /><br />The best part of this album though, at least for me, is \\"Name of the Game.\\" It is the most hauntingly beautiful rock ballad I've ever heard. When Harrison heard Emerick's version - while he didn't like it - he recognized the vast potential of the song and became quite interested in it. Like several of the songs on the album, he had the band re-record it with him in the booth. Both versions are on the CD, and if you compare them, the difference is remarkable; George enhanced the melancholy tone of the song and gave it a big Spector-like sound. For it's part, the band became inspired and delivered a incredible performance. It's a beaut.<br /><br />As for the sound: While I'm extremely grateful to have this major upgrade in sound, I was a bit disappointed that more of the murkiness wasn't eliminated. One wouldn't think that the first generation stereo masters sound like this. Perhaps only a remix could remedy the situation, but it's getting a little late in the game to do a major overhaul. If it was ever going to be done, this was probably the last chance to do it.
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|Kid Rock has decided to jump off of what made him the artist he is now formally know as, to join the new cash cow of country pop. If Steven Tyler ever comes out of his latest what ever induced fog he is in, this version of Kid Rock would be the perfect next judge for American Idol. This is not the Rap rocker Kid Rock of old, so spend that hard earned money on anything else but this.
0439023513|5.0|Collins brings The Hunger Games series to a satisfying conclusion with the usual page-turning addictiveness of the previous two books.  Collins has special insight into our common deepest fears and emotions and brings these to life in vivid fashion through her complex but endearing characters.  It is an utterly gripping and delightfully bitter/sweet experience.
B004BSIJ9Q|3.0|If this is what is considered a classic album then I feel bad for hip hop.  I think the album is pretty good but nowhere near a perfect one.  There are some songs I really enjoy like All Of The Lights, Dark Fantasy, Monster, Runaway and So Appalled.  I'd say musically is where the album shines though lyrically it suffers a bit.  I like Jay's guest spots a lot as well as Nicki Minaj but why Rick Ross?  That guy is a joke.  But other than that I think All Of The Lights is the best song on here.  Rihanna sounds great on the hook and the beat is awesome.  The beat on So Appalled is also really cool.  Anyway, if you like Kanye you would probably enjoy this quite a bit. Just being a semi-fan, I thought it was decent.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This movie was made of awesome.     I haven't reread the book, as I've done previously with the films, so I wasn't in my nit-picking mood.     Plus, the special effects looked fabulous. Both Dobby and Kreacher looked real and, although my brain knows that Nagiri isn't real, my eyes couldn't tell that.     The trio are so much better actors now than they were in the previous six films - whatever advice or acting lessons they took paid off.     Alan Rickman appears in the film not nearly enough but steals the show for the 2 milliseconds he is on screen.     I thought that the storyline and the necessary revisions, as well as additions were handled well. I would see this movie again in theaters. Soon.
B002NZK5VY|2.0|Love the movie, but beware of this DVD. 3 times I've ordered it from Amazon (twice in a Slipcase and once in a Keepcase, and all 3 DVD's skipped, the video broke up, scenes kept repeating, etc... And yes, I used the Memorex CD cleaner on the DVD player without any change, and no, none of my numerous other commercially purchased DVD's demonstrate this problem. Two Weeks Notice is the ONLY one. So my suggestion is to stick to the VCR version.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Once you decide to go with HDTV.....make sure your cable box is \\"HD Ready\\" in my case our provider is Direct TV and the new box must be installed but in the meantime, the TV is still operable, simply not in HD mode.

0316069485|5.0|Wow...I had lost all hope that Michael Connelly good ever again write a great story where you really cared about the characters and what was going on. (The Concrete Blood, The Lincoln Lawyer etc).  Gone are the wooden characters and the stilted dialogue of his last 5 or so books....this will reminded me of why I fell in love with Michael Coneely books many years ago!
B001NLKT60|1.0|Contrived characters, gratuitous sexual encounters, pages of product placement. I gave up on the book after a hundred pages. Hopefully gets better afterwards, but I have no plans to continue reading.
B003NFM3JK|2.0|I give this movie a lower rating not because of the wonderful visual affects or the great backgrounds of the 1800's. No, I give it a lower rating because there are scenes in there that I believe are NOT appropriate for younger children. This movie has \\"scary\\" moments as well as characters for little minds. I don't believe that because our children have grown up in the age of technology that they should experience this at an earlier age.  Anyway, back to what I was saying.... of course the last ghost - death I believe it is is suppose to be dark. However, that ghost has some characters that tag along with him, black horses with red eye and a black carriage. My son of 8 looked at me and said \\" mom, I think this is suppose to be a Halloween movie\\". He took the words right out of my mouth.     The makers of this movie are going for the wow factor and they got it however I will NOT be telling friends to rent this with their 3 yr old around or any children under 6 or 7. Disney, you should be ashamed!    All in all, same story- nice to look at visually and I am sure it will be splendid on Blue Ray too.
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|I've been a Kid Rock fan since the beginning and have always loved how he moved from one thing to the next and grew with his music. Not now. This CD is BORING BORING BORING. I'm so disappointed and I'll probably never listen to it again. What a bummer.
B0040QYROK|3.0|This has always been one of my favorites. To have this new cut makes it even more exciting.   However, the music kills any tension the film hopes to generate.  In the 70's, I saw this film on PBS as part of a series of classic films. It was from the BBC and had an electronic soundtrack composed by William Fitzwater and Hugh Davies.  Finally, someone got it right! Turned the film into the horrific masterpiece it is.  Contacted Criterian regarding this. Sadly, it is not included.
0740797719|5.0|As a self taught painter who has struggled with the concepts of color and light and had to glean bits of information from dozens of sources, I am glad that a book of this quality has finally been published. Mr Gurney has done an outstanding job of bringing these concepts into one well written source. Good job!
B00005T30L|1.0|When I saw that Steve Buscemi was in this, my roommate and I rented it.  Mind you, we have seen thousands of movies and we generally do not have high expectations of movies.  We can see a pretty bad movie and still find some entertainment value in it.  This is the only movie in my life that was actually painful to watch.  A creepy old man hanging out with an 18-year old girl and it all seemed to center around selling old vinyl albums at garage sales.  I'm serious, that's the plot.  4-stars?  That is hilarious.  I really wanted to turn this off after about 20 minutes and actually bring it back to Blockbuster and demand an exchange for anything else which I had never thought of doing before.  But I actually thought.... NO... this MUST get better, there must be some point to this movie??  So my roommate and I tredged on, grimacing as the movie plodded through its scenes.  Then after our brains were pretty much mush and we had lost all track of time, the movie ended and she got on a bus.  A bus which doesn't really exist.  We were like... what?  NO.  It cannot have ended like that with some last ditch effort at the end of the movie to try to be artsy with this imaginary bus that only crazy, dead, really old, or people that frequent garage sales seeking dusty vinyl albums can seem to see and ride on.    This was the only movie in my life that I actually felt that I had just wasted 2 hours of my life, and I would never get them back, and I was angry.  I think I am still angry, and it has been more than 5 years since I have seen this piece of crap.
B003W4YQUG|5.0|Directed by Tom Ford, a fashion designer who also supplied much of the wardrobe, this is a much better representation of the art of Christopher Isherwood than is \\"Cabaret,\\" also based on an Isherwood novella. This is Los Angeles in the early 60s, with the cars, the architecture, and the counter-culture as it was about to explode. It is the story, brilliantly conceived and executed, of a gay college professor who's lost the love of his life, and how he saves himself and is saved from despair and suicide.
2253150711|5.0|Having lived and worked in Japan myself for over ten years, with many similar experiences, I completely related to this book. Not only was it funny, but it was insightful of the Japanese culture and the inner workings of Japanese companies. Amelie's approach to dealing with the absurdities of Japanese passive-aggressive behavior was brilliant. This was not only funny and insightful, but it was good story telling as she beat the Japanese at their own game.
B00007L4MJ|4.0|I have read all kinds of reviews of this reproduction, both positive and negative, but this particulare re-construction of the original with lost segments, intertitles that pick up for lost sequences, makes the most sense of the story and theme.  The music sound track was good and well timed. For the first time, after seeing cut up verisons from before, I feel we have the real essence, story line, and coherent movie that is as close as we are going to get to the original.<br />Current sci-fi's beware, this is a ground breaking first film, and as such suffers some the acting and staging conventions of the silent era and early film.  It's theme, as most sci fi movies do, focuses on current concerns in society expressed in futuristic terms.  This one deals with the very real conflict of labor, management, class warfare, and machine phobia of the immediate era preceeing it.<br />It is an excellent ground breaking movie of its time and its value is one of being first in many areas, including special effects.<br /><br />Sci Fy Guy
B00000JXVK|5.0|Bruce Brown not only made the must see Surf movie, but he also made a must see motorcycle film!

B00001OH7P|5.0|David Bowie was not the only glam rocker in the early 1970s to deal with the issue of being a rock n roll star - both the glamour side and the dark side of it. Both Mott the Hoople and T-Rex took up the same theme, but not as comprehensively as David Bowie did in 1972 on the album \\"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars.\\" The album probably is Bowie's most complete from his glam rock period and his songwriting on the album is strong, consistent and catchy.<br /><br />Bowie's backing band from the his previous and equally excellent albums \\"The Man Who Sold the Year\\" and \\"Hunky Dory\\" is intact with Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Woody Woodmansey as \\"The Spiders From Mars.\\"<br /><br />The album opens in the best \\"Life From Mars\\" style with the magnificent \\" Five Years \\". Bowie is vocally extraordinary convincing on \\"Soul Love\\" - great chorus.<br /><br />\\"Moonage Daydream\\" is at the same simple and grandiose - with strings, flute, acoustic guitar and a lead guitar in the best Robin Trower style. \\"Starman\\" is reminiscent of \\"Space Oddity\\" and the biggest single hit taken from the album. Incredibly catchy.<br /><br />For quite a long time I felt the cover-version of \\"It Is not Easy\\" was a little out of place - yes, the number stands out from the others, but it has now become one of my favorites.

More light-hearted are \\"Star\\" and \\"Hang on to Yourself\\" -  both classic rock and roll.<br /><br />The title-track \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" is another of the album's most haunting songs - especially the intro guitar riff will stick with you. \\"Suffragette City\\" could have been a Mott the Hoople \\"if it were not for Bowie's fantastic vocals.

B004AQPPNM|4.0|This cd has been getting either great reviews or ehh reviews. Mine will be in the middle. I was really excited for this album as this is my all time favorite band. These guys are incredible.   Anyway, this album was definitely oriented towards the pop punk crowd which really threw me off, that well, this is ADTR now? but it's not bad. As producer Chad Gilbert said \\"You know, there going out of the box a little, but still keeping it heavy, keeping it A day to remember.\\" I completely agree. They still have the ADTR style in there. The breakdowns in my opinion are a little weak but still pretty good. I feel kevin has filled in really well for tom and has let his style come through. I'm a little disappointed but still after a few listens. I'm really starting to like this album. Here are song by song reviews  Sticks and bricks: 5/5  one of my favorites even the though the breakdown is a little weak. Kinda reminds me or Mr. Highway.   All I want: 5/5  A little different song by ADTR but by far the catchiest on the album.   It's complicated: 4/5   At first, i didn't really like this song because it just doesn't sound like something ADTR would produce, but im  starting to like it.   This is the house that doubt built 4/5  I like the clean strumming in the beginning then the distortion. This song has an awesome message and is one of my favorites.   2nd sucks 5/5   I really like this song, the heaviest on the album and one of the heaviest ADTR has ever made. Once again, breakdown kinda weak but still overall really catchy and heavy.   Better off this way 4/5  A really catchy punk sounding song. Pretty good  All signs point to lauderdale 5/5  A catchy song that i really like, this is almost the type of song ADTR would produce without the screaming. I like having florida in the song title too.   You be tails, i'll be sonic 4/5  One of the heavy songs on the album, this reminds me of im made of wax larry. An alright breakdown and catchy chorus.  Out of time 4/5  I just revised this review, at first i didn't really like this song but after hearing how great the lyrics are and all of a sudden, i really like this song, it's catchy.    If i leave, 4/5  A pretty good light song that's catchy.   overall this album is solid because ADTR went out of the box a little while still keeping to themselves what they are as musicians. I would recommend this anyone who likes them for songs in the past but for the people who like the heaviest songs ADTR has, then only get 2nd sucks and sticks and bricks. Now revising it again, I've decided that if amazon had a 4.5 out of 5, that's what this album would be. A very good album!!!!!!!!

There are just a few text pages (basic bio and career steps + foreword) and I like that, I mean I buy the book for the art, not to read. ;)   The art is usually from top to bottom, and there are also numerous detail shots. A few more sketches and wip stages would've been nice also. You can find a more elaborate review on parkablogs.com     If you're a fantasy-art, meaning orcs, dwarfs, trolls and magic this is the book for you!

0316044938|4.0|Wow.  This was another one of those books where I finished it and just kind of sat for a few moments trying to make sense of it all.  It was certainly interesting, and had parts that were both brutal and beautiful.  But then it also had parts that left me deeply unsatisfied with the book.<br /><br />The first perspective is from Susie Salmon.  She is looking down from her \\"heaven\\" after she has been murdered.  Through her eyes we see the grief of her parents and siblings, the actions of her neighbors and friends, and the sly cunning of the man who murdered her.  She jumps back in forth through time showing things she remembers from her own life and also experiencing new parts of life that she missed out on by dying vicariously through her remaining family members and friends.  She sees their struggles and pain, their reactions to her death and the inability to cope.  When she's not looking down on them, she explores briefly her own world where she is now.  The \\"heaven\\" she has made for herself isn't as spectacular as she thought it would be, but more provides a training ground into acceptance.<br /><br />Susie as the narrator, is of course one of the people mostly closely connected to in this book.  She drifts from being young to mature when describing her family and their actions and her emotions come through strongly.  She is a bit biased of course, having once been alive and human, and so her siblings and parents are described through her eyes.  Her mother is lonely and somewhat selfish.  Her father is a martyr and dedicated to his family and especially her memory.  Her sister is distant but strong.  And her little brother is lost and forgotten at times.  She also sees her friends but they aren't given as much description as her family is, aside from a few that she follows while they grow up.<br /><br />Sebold's writing is beautiful.  And she doesn't hesitate to show the grittier horrifying aspects of the novel either.  Susie's rape and murder are described in this book and it hurts to read.  Its also difficult to read that she was dismembered but this is also mentioned several times.  It may be too much for some readers to handle.  She does a good job of describing emotion though and that takes precedence in this book.  It is all about emotion; Susie's, her family's, her friends, and I can see where it is very realistic.  The first two thirds of the novel are splendidly written, and then we get to the last third.  I'm not sure why but it was in a completely different tone and I did not enjoy it as well.  Without giving anything away, I do want to say that there is a scene in the last part that completely cheapened the whole novel for me and should have been left out.  The rest seemed as if it was hastily written to appeal to the masses instead of staying true to the original workings of the book.  It was very disappointing.<br /><br />Its still a book worth reading though and I do recommend it.  It's a touching story and it does have an impact on the emotions.  Having read this book, I will probably check out some of Sebold's other works.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones<br />Copyright 2002<br />328 pages<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2010read.

B0042RUMEQ|1.0|Its simple, you cannot compare her to the real female legends of Hip Hop-(Trina) & LiL Kim.  This is a weak album with its auto-tune. This has no heart or art, its just cocky mainstream garbage.  I am still hoping we can see the Nicki from the mixtapes. That is were the passion is.   Trina owns the throne and Nicki just follows!!
B0043A0PXU|5.0|Too often I go out and collect any and every Christmas CD I can find by all my favorite artists, so I have quite the collection of CDs to my name. When I found out this year that Annie Lennox had released one I jumped for joy. I knew that she would provide us with something different and I wasn't disappointed in the least! I was expecting different arrangements, but not different SONGS ...much to my surprise I got both. :-)<br /><br />The album offers a different set of songs from the typical ones we've grown SO USED TO hearing in every store across the country. The Holly and the Ivy is one I sang in Madrigals myself and it was such a delight to hear her version of the song. The more classic songs on the album don't disappoint either as they provide new arrangements with unique harmonies.<br /><br />The majority of the album is very upbeat and uplifting with only a few songs that take on a slower pace. While there are a few times that you may notice a note here or there that could have been corrected, I myself, gain respect for the fact that the album is authentic and not PERFECTED. It's 100% Annie Lennox and that's what I wanted. Buy this CD if you're looking for something to enjoy this year that will put a smile on your face, get your toes/fingers tapping and warm your heart!

0743437497|4.0|Somehow I've made it to this age having only read one Stephen King novel (Pet Sematary).  So I decided to remedy this by reading The Shining, which I had heard was immensely creepy.  I had also liked the movie as well, which also inspired my reading of this novel.  I did enjoy the book, it was frightening at some parts but also had a good back story as well.<br /><br />Jack Torrance and his family have been hired to be caretakers at the famous Overlook Hotel during the winter season.  Since roads become impassable in the winter to get to the motel, they will be the only ones around to take care of the place.  It will also help Jack get back on his feet after being fired from his last job and also his recovery from being an alcoholic.  With him is his wife Wendy and his son Danny.  Together they will spend their time at the hotel with a fully stocked larder preparing for winter and just enjoying each other's company while being a healing family.  The Overlook has other plans however.  With a warning in his head from the hotel chef before he left Danny knows the place is sinister.  He has what the cook (Hallorann) calls the \\"Shining\\" which is the ability to perceive things and have precognition.  The Overlook wants Danny and this ability, and with its dark history, will stoop to using Jack's weaknesses to get its way.  The Overlook wants to party once more.<br /><br />Jack is a very tragic character with few redeeming qualities.  He tries to be a strong family man, but really is just too weak.  Between the temptation of alcohol and his fondness for chewing aspirin he has several addictions.  And these addictions make him dangerous before the hotel even starts influencing him.  Wendy was more of a filler character.  She was there to be strong for Danny and offer Jack a few problems, but the book doesn't give as much focus to her.  Danny of course is greatly intriguing with his \\"shining\\".  It was an interesting concept to give the boy and really plays an integral part in the book.  I liked Hallorann really well.  He was a very cool character and helped explain some of the more complicated aspects of the story.<br /><br />King is a very entertaining writer.  He comes up with these crazy ideas and is able to get them down on paper.  He does a lot of character development in this book and while I always appreciate that, it does make the first third of the book somewhat slow moving.  I also would have liked to see more scary scenes in the book although possibly the movie could have made me crave this more.  As a warning there is a lot of harsh language in this book and it might not be appropriate for some children.  Parental discretion is advised.  Otherwise, there were a few things that were offensive as well which could affect all ages.<br /><br />It was an interesting book and some parts really kept me at the edge of my seat.  Yes, there were a few things that could have been improved, but overall the book was good.  I look forward to reading more of his work.<br /><br />The Shining<br />Copyright 1977<br />464 pages<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2010iked Hallorann really well.

Truly the best music soundtrack since Moulin Rouge! 5 stars  You will notice people like C.

0142000671|5.0|In 1943 with the tides of war turning and the Germans starting to go on the defense the Nazi's turn to more unconventional forms of warfare. German scientists experiment with gene splicing animal DNA with that of a man to create a new super soldier with the ferocity of a rodent and the ability to reproduce at an astounding rate. From the Nobel prize winning author John Steinbeck comes \\"OF MICE AND MEN!\\". US informants get word of these experiments and plans are made to stop the production of these genes-spliced super soldiers. Two highly trained American GI's, George Milton, and Lennie Small volunteer in the mission to infiltrate the top secret Nazi facility. George is an intelligent man but is down on his luck and desperate for work so he immediately volunteers for the assignment. On his side is his long-time friend Lenny Small who he knew for his entire life. Lenny isn't the most intelligent of fellows but makes up for it with his large size and experience in hand-to-hand combat, being able to take out German guards with his bare hands.<br />Far behind enemy lines the two are tasked with destroying the main experimental facilities and assassinating the lead officials and scientists involved. Of Mice and Men is a timeless classic about killing scores of Nazi's and gene-spliced mutants. John Steinbeck really is a great author and perfectly captures the imagery of 1940's wartorn Europe. I am greatly looking forward to reading Steinbeck's other classic novel \\"The Grapes Of Wrath\\" where a government chemical weapon's project is unleashed on a rural farming area which leads to residents of a nearby vineyard going on a rage-infused killing spree.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I saw this movie several times in the cinema and I thought it was a masterpiece: the acting, the cinematography, the 80s atmosphere, the themes of isolation; as well as the seductive power of evil and its tragic side as well-------it all makes for a work of art on celluloid. I must say that the endless remarks about this film not coming up to the quality of the Swedish version are enough to make me grab a barf bag: the author of the novel upon which both films are based considers himself incredibly lucky to have two \\"excellent\\" interpretations of his one story in these two films: you'd think sometimes that in some peoples' minds the Swedish film came before the Swedish novel. At any rate, both films are top-notch, but for my taste, I'd give the big edge to Let Me In: I think Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee bring a depth of emotion to the characters that surpasses the performances in Let the Right One In----------and no, it's not because I don't like subtitles or \\"foreign\\" films. I can't wait to get this DVD. It deserves a half dozen Oscars, especially considering some of the crud that was released this past year. BUY IT!!
B003M98792|5.0|PRO:  This is a great restoration.  If you have the bootleg version, give it away and get this!      CON:    The only bad thing about this is the audio commentary.  There is a short interview with Samuel Jackson, who is a fan,  which is worth watching.    The two audio commentaries are from the makers of Shogun Assassin, who re-edited it from the original Lone Wolf series.  This audio commentary is so-so interesting, and probably worth listening to for die hard fans.    The second audio commentary is with a Kung Fu Magazine film critic and a Kung Fu and Kendo master.   The film critic gives you every possible fact about this film, the decline of the Japanese film industry in the 1970s  and more than anybody could possible want to know.  Almost like a transcript of the day by day events that led to the folding of the studio.  The Kung Fu master, when he does speak only speaks about true meaning of the film as it relates to Earth, Wind, and Fire.  He is clearly put off by the film critic dominating the commentary, but when prompted to speak about technical aspects of the Sword,  fighting style, Martial art stances, etc,  he answers with philosophical aspects of earth, wind and or fire.  At the end of the film they both decide to just talk over each other.

0345477618|5.0|I have LITERALLY been reading about the making of Star Wars my entire life, and I learned things I never knew in this book.  I'm not sure if that's because this is one of the best books about the making of a movie ever written(it is), or if it's because George Lucas is the master of the teasing drip of content(he is).  Either way, this is a treat for Star Wars fans, filmmakers and people interested in moviemaking in general.  It will inspire you, encourage you, and frustrate you.  When you see how much work Lucas actually had to put into the first film, how hard it was to secure funding, to fight the schedule, to make it happen at all, you'll be amazed that the film ever reached theaters.<br /><br />Perhaps more than anything else, this book captures a certain period of American Filmmaking, the mid-70s artistic boom.  Lucas, Speilberg, Coppolla, and many others were taking the Hollywood system by storm and changed everything.  Sure, now their style of filmmaking has become \\"they Hollywood System,\\" but at the time it was new and fresh and dangerous.<br /><br />It makes me dream of what the next filmmaking revolution will be...
B0042816YK|1.0|This is one long slog of a dull and pretentious film featuring an equally pretentious, narcissistic twerp who dumps her husband for no good reason and goes on a soul-searching journey in three different countries. She prays a teeny bit, eats some stuff in Italy, talks to a spiritual guide in Bali, and spends an inordinate amount of time in an ashram in India.  But so what?  None of it amounts to much, and it's so dull that I could hardly stop yawning. I found myself not caring at all what happened to her or to anyone else in the story.  I hit the FFWD button on my remote several times because I just wanted it to be over quickly.    What a waste of the actors and the locations.      Ryan Murphy did a great job with Nip/Tuck and Glee, but he simply cannot handle a feature film.
031603438X|3.0|A pretty good read, of course there is the inaccuracy that the Rolling Stones were created by Keith and Mick, the band was created by Brian Jones, and Charlie and Bill and Ian and Andrew were equally important.  Mick and Keith hi-jacked the band when Brian fell ill, and took all the creative credits, yes Mick wrote the words. Keith only became important in '68 when Brian was fading away.<br />I am a die - hard Stones fan, but asked if I am a Keith or Mick I would have to say I Brian Jones and Then all the rest of the original line up.  After Brian was gone they became predictable but still a great band.  When Bill left in the late '80's they became sterile and boring.<br />Anyway the book is Keith's account, stealing Anita from Brian had to be the last blow to Brian, after losing control of the band, and of course Keith claims that Brain was abusive to Anita, what about Mick to Marianne Faithful??  This is Keith's version, and he may be right on a lot of accounts, but the creation of the Rolling Stones was Brian's doing, not his or Mick's.

It's also the same aluminum finish so it looks like was made for my laptop.    Very pleased!!!

B003EV6DBW|3.0|Very long-time Dr Who fan.  I don't have a problem with Matt Smith as the Doctor, but I am always taken aback at the rude \\"Shut up\\" statements.  I also heard the \\"Bow ties are cool\\" enough to last 12 regenerations - please lose that phrase!    The BluRay set is a bit light on extras.  I'm not much of a fan of the video commentaries; it's a bit distracting.  Audio commentary would have been good enough.    The series is changing; I'm not sure that it is for the better. I have to say that \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\" is my all-time favorite of the new series, and the invention of the weeping angels in \\"Blink\\" was utterly brilliant.  But what a sad comedown to this series' portrayal of the angels as just another savage killer race. They've gone from \\"the kindest way of killing anyone\\" to one of the most brutal.    I, for one, am tired of the \\"arc\\" or \\"theme\\" that they seem to feel is necessary to put into each and every series.  It was a clever idea with \\"Bad Wolf\\", but it has become tiresome... and it leads the powers that be to try to top the finale from the previous year.    As another reviewer has said, there isn't a show in this series that is head and shoulders above the rest.    I'm not all the way through the discs yet; it is always interesting to see what was cut from what was shown on television.    Bottom line: it's OK; I hope it gets better next season.

I had to know what happened to the heroine,Liz Salander..Who was really supporting her and who was her enemy?<br />The character development is done amazingly well with many individuals. I found myself thinking about them while I had to be away from my reading addiction.<br />There are sections that are tediously political.  Don't lose interest..Hang in there!! It is well worth your time!!<br />A psychological eye-opener..A Great Read!!!
B0017OB12O|4.0|The first half of The Bridge on the River Kwai threw me off, because the image is so devoid of color or detail. It looks flat and just plain horrible. I thought I had accidentally put in the DVD instead. It's not until we are taken to the seaside resort where William Holden's character frolics on the beach with a babe on R&R and is then recruited by the British commando unit that you see what the new restoration has in store. From then on it gets better, even in the jungle sequences where it had previously looked depressing and lacking in every way, it presents more color, depth, and detail. As the conditions improve for the characters, so do the qualities of the images we seem them engage in.<br /><br />I came to the realization that the look of the first half of the film is intended to make you as a viewer feel the pain of what the soldiers are feeling. They are forced to live in a depressing setting devoid of color and detail, so why shouldn't you see what they see? So many things I had never seen before, nor heard, come to fruition in this new restoration and HD mastering. Thank you Sony and everyone involved for all your hard work. I look forward to seeing Lawrence of Arabia next year!
B0042816YK|4.0|There are many mixed reactions to both the popular book EAT LOVE PRAY by Elizabeth Gilbert and the cinematic transcription by Jennifer Salt and director Ryan Murphy - from adoration to loathing. And exploring the reasons for this spectrum probably would result in a hint as to how far in life's journey each responder has gone.  The general theme of the fallout from sustaining a broken heart and being the perpetrator of breaking a heart makes for a thoughtful discussion on where we are in our ability to form lasting relationships today. The movie may be awash in color and overwhelm the viewer with National Geographic-like splendors of the world, but at the fore of the film is a little tale that deserves telling - or at least thinking about.<br /><br />Writer Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) sees what is lacking in her early marriage to Stephen (Billy Crudup) and realizes as a couple they have grown apart.  She tells Stephen quite frankly that the marriage is over - leaving a broken heart in Stephen.  Liz's editor Delia (Viola Davis) supports Liz's sense of being lost and encourages her to follow her instincts and set out to see the world and in the process to find herself.  After a ricochet romance with young actor David Piccolo (James Franco) who is a free spirit and introduces Liz to meditation, Liz gathers her courage and sets off to see the world.  She visits Bali, meets healer Ketut (Hadi Subiyanto), who encourages her to deal with her inner self and follow her heart.  Liz is off to Rome where she discovers the secret of simply relaxing to enjoy being alive - while she consumes plentiful Italian cooking! - and engages an Italian language teacher Giovanni (Luca Argentero) and a mutual friend Sofi (Tuva Novotny) and in time absorbs the sense of family and unconditional love and the beauty and gestural language of Italy.  She then travels to India where she joins an ashram to concentrate on meditation and makes friends with a young girl Tulsi (Rushita Singh) who is facing a forced marriage (Liz offers her advice that marriage is what you make it), and a Texan Richard (Richard Jenkins, offering the strongest performance in the film) who ultimately shares his sad past of broken hearts with Liz as they bond. Liz then is off to Bali to see Ketut again and discovers Felipe (Javier Bardem) who is likewise distancing himself from a ruined marriage but retains a close love for his children.  It is this final coming together of two souls with similar needs who form the ending of the story.<br /><br />Yes, the story tugs at the heartstrings at bit heavily but perhaps being a little more vulnerable to the ideas about which this book/film speak is what we all need more than chat room cold distancing.  The cinematography by Robert Richardson is lushly colorful and the original music score by Dario Marianelli enhances each step of the film's journey.  The cast is well chosen, even in the small roles (one would expect only the best from the all star cast assembled), and the direction keeps the at times confusing back and forth process of storytelling fluid.  Maybe it is the approaching season that makes this film feel warm, but that is really OK.

0812973992|5.0|This is another of the great books in my life. It's about chance, the power of choices and the courage to be found in living ordinary lives. It improves your relationship with yourself to think about all these things that are the stuff of life.<br /><br />His characters have depth and are permanently imprinted on the reader's heart. I hit an all-time high of ten bookmarks in my Kindle for this book (a bookmark is the electronic form on highlighting notable passages). One of the very special quotes I marked is:<br /><br />\\"Some people think love is the end of the road and if you're lucky enough to find it you stay there. Other people say it just becomes a cliff you drive off, but most people who've been around a while know it' just a thing that changes day by day, and depending on how much you fight for it, you get it or hold on to it or you lose it, but sometimes it's never there in the first place.\\"<br /><br />Or this bit of wisdom about pain:<br /><br />\\"She likes the people with the endurance to tolerate the drudge, the ones who know that pain is a requirement, not a curse.\\"<br /><br />The characters live in New York City and their lives intersect and bang into each other in surprising ways. It's richly textured and I wanted it to go on and on. It won the National Book Award in 2009.
B00275EHJQ|1.0|Toy Story 3 is a great movie, but WAIT for a better DVD Treatment.     Allow lots and lots and lots of time to get the movie started.     The DVD doesn't even play on some players, thanks to some DRM (Digital Restriction Mess-Up).     UOPs (User Operation Prohibition) are FULLY enabled on this DVD meaning that you cannot skip over many parts of the DVD and are FORCED to watch things you have no interest in.     While it is easy to purchse a DVD player that overrides UOPs, there are no Blu-ray players that do this YET.     Avoid this presentation of the movie. When a later one is released that is not hostile to the viewer, buy it only then.

031603438X|4.0|Keith Richards is a founding member of the Rolling Stones and has been a driving force in Rock and Roll for almost 50 years. He's one of the Glimmer Twins, who with Mick Jagger has given us a music portfolio of which 20 song writers would be envious. He's a man who seemingly defies the rules of mortality - a junkie, boozer, chain smoker - he's walked away from car wrecks and falling out of trees. He's been busted by the authorities more times and in more countries than Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton, Charlie Sheen and Mel Gibson combined. A survivor, it's not difficult to imagine that if Keith never \\"made it\\" as a Rolling Stone he'd be playing guitar somewhere, even if it was in prison or on street corners in London. If a face can tell a life's story than Richards' speaks volumes. He epitomizes the definition of a rock and roll musician and at the ripe old age of 66 has decided to tell us his story with Life.    This is a big book which rambles, digresses and pontificates. I'm not sure if Keith dictated his tale and then it was put to paper, but it sure reads that way - which seems appropriate. Richards takes us from his earliest memories through present day. He chronicles his introduction to music, Chicago blues, the guitar and Mick Jagger; the founding of the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World; their early days, their breakthrough to stardom and ultimately their iconic status. We follow the rise and fall of Brian Jones; the addition of Mick Taylor and the group's most creative period; Ronnie Wood's audition and inclusion; and the separation, feud and uneasy reconciliation with Mick Jagger.    Richards is also surprisingly candid on his drug use and abuse as well as the women, i.e. Anita Pallenberg, in his life and fatherhood. The on the road stories with his then 7 year old son Marlon are both disturbing and touching at the same time. Richards' many friends - many of whom are also dead - step in and out of the narrative, usually captured in drug and alcohol fueled anecdotes. And his reunion with his father Bert after a 20 year estrangement has a story-book quality to it in a Keith Richards sort of way. All the while he and the Stones keep plugging away.    That's the good news. The bad news is what is and what is not covered here. Although the reader is provided with a detailed description on the creation and recording of Exile On Main St and his discovery of \\"open tuning\\" - which has led to many of Richards' distinctive riffs - I yearned for more about the music. Many of the songs, albums and tours - Altamont gets 3 pages - are glossed over while the \\"scene\\" - the clubs, drugs and busts - are covered in great detail, again and again, which quickly becomes repetitive.  Although the opening chapter's drug bust in Arkansas is priceless, by the third or fourth run-in with authorities - and there are many more included in this book - it was more than clear policemen were not on Keith's Christmas card list. What is interesting is how both shrewd lawyers and circumstances conspired to keep our favorite, (living), guitar hero out of the \\"Big House\\".      This is not a great book but a good one - and as far as rock and roll memoirs go - a very good one. Richards dispels many myths - blood transfusions and the like - while adding to his legend. If you are a Stones' fan you will not be disappointed but like me you may wish for more. On the other hand, considering the \\"subject\\" and the times this may be the best chronicle to be hoped for and we should be thankful for that.
B0038BBA4I|2.0|I'm not a big fan of buying music one song at a time, but this is one album that is just SCREAMING for it. The only song of their's that I was familiar with is Little Lion Man, and I'm only familiar with the radio-edit version that doesn't have the foul language.    I was expecting that the rest of the album would be something close to Little Lion Man. Nope. The rest of the album is SLOW and dull. Filled with childish rhymes and frankly shallow lyrics.    I don't mind childish or shallow IF the song is fast and fun. But the rest of their songs are slow and tedious. The exception is Winter Winds, but even it's a sorry sister to the folk rock I was expecting. They didn't even include a radio-edit version of Little Lion Man. It would have been nice to listen to that one with kids or women-folk in the car.    Save your cash and buy this one - one song at a time.
B001NXBRJG|4.0|This is a good version of the Matrix, but beware if you buy it expecting the digital copy. The disc and code are included in the package, but it expired on March 31, 2010.

B002ZG999U|4.0|There was a lot of anticipation for this movie.  Not only were we going to see Sylvester Stallone return to the guts and glory of the 80s action genre but with him, such immortals as Mickey Rourke, Jet Li, and Steve Austin among many others.  And on that level, we get just that: guts (lots of it) and glory.  We see guts as the team of superstars blow a foe in half at the beginning of the film.  We see guts as 20 plus armed guards are taken out by an unarmed man (maybe two, I don't remember) in high energy hand to hand combat that defies the odds (not to mention basic physics).  And we see glory as a jealous boyfriend beats up his girl's lover at an outdoor basketball court. The action is near non-stop, and on that level the film is a Godsend for the action loving crowd.    With all that action, we really don't need much of a plot, right?  Well, when we consider that past action films such as The Terminator, Die Hard, and Rambo had master plots that were really what drove the action, it becomes clear that all the explosions and bloodshed are really only as good as the story that drives them.  And that's where The Expendables delivers on an only somewhat acceptable level.  The plot is simple: The bad guy wants to take over a small island nation and the \\"expendables\\" have to stop him.  A girl is thrown in as well as a few subplots but that's really it.  Unlike the previous action classics, it becomes obvious after a single viewing of this movie that the action drives the plot.  Not the other way around.    So, does that make the film indeed expendable?  The answer is no.  While the plot may be weak, the charm of the action heroes that make up most of the cast more than make up for it.  I mean, we actually get to see all these guys crammed into one movie!  Jet Li does his usual martial art acrobatics while Mickey Rourke is his usual bad boy self.  Bruce Willis (in a cameo that should have been longer) talks tough and the whole time, Sylvester is proving that mussel doessometimes outplay brains.  And that's the whole point of this film.  It's dripping wet with machismo and a manly persona that we simply don't see enough of in today's movies.    Also: Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis on screen for a brief moment with Stallone: pure magic if you ask me.

Impeccably acted, shot, and written, this is a weekly, feature film quality character study about survival in an extreme situation. The extreme situation just happens to be the best looking (in terms of make up quality) zombies ever put to film in any medium. This show is TV perfection.

B003K15IF8|5.0|What a captivating story. A classic up-from-the-hardscrabble-farm tale. But with only ordinary success at the end. The title has an unfortunate modern meaning that it did not when first published in the 1950s, but you soon realize that it doesn't apply.<br /><br />A story of love, with all of its tragedy. Sad, yes, but with enough joy to know the difference and Stoner finds much of his joy in his work. \\"What did you expect?\\" the teacher asks himself again and again in a Victorian-style deathbed scene. One without the comfort of an explicit god, yet full of the religion of life.<br /><br />Stoner's appraisal of his student-lover's book: \\"The prose was graceful and its passion was masked by a coolness and clarity of intelligence,\\" is a fitting summary of his creator's effort as well. With the exception of a few long, vague sentences I had to reread several times before I could understand half the sense. So I moved on. For the most part the telling was seductive and endearing.

B004BSEKH6|4.0|i'm not sure what folks were expecting? beethovens 9th as told through a hot pink haired beauty?  something that will utterly change them forever? It's POP music folks, that's short for popular in case you hadn't heard and this is a great example of music that you are slightly embarrassed to love. The songs that you turn up really high and sing along with cuz you know every single word. When they come on the radio you and your besties giggle and then go right along belting it out. That's what this album is. A great pop album. The lyrics are concise and memorable- slightly saccharine but that's because it's gonna slightly touch more people. If you wanted something deep you're an idiot to think you're gonna find it here. If you want something fun, bumping and catchy- ladies and gentlemen, Ms Nicki Minaj!
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Winter's Bone is one of those rare movies that pulls you in so deeply, you begin to feel unsafe yourself.  You are no longer a casual spectator, you are there.  The setting wraps itself around you so strongly, you can almost identify the smells. Your heart will pound; a tear may fall. With some scenes you may feel the need to peek through your fingers, or to look away, but you're suddenly in too deep.  There's no going back!  You begin to realize that you are an outsider voyeuristically intruding on an often forgotten subculture; one with roots back to the 19th century; one that still makes its own rules; one where death is just a fact of life; one where illegal activities and brutality are the accepted code. You are mesmerized, and horrified at the same time. You feel like you are trespassing into a secret world, so close to all of us, yet so far away.<br /><br />Having spent some time in the Appalachians, hearing countless survival stories, I can attest that from Appalachia, westward, through the Ozarks, that the clans may change, but many rural mountain folk share the same demons of poverty, inferior education, health care and often pitiful living conditions.  Much of this is a self-fulfilling prophesy, as the mountain people generally do not like outside intrusions, and, as witnessed in this film, sometimes they don't even trust their own.  This was so authentically depicted in Winter's Bone, where survival overpowers loyalty.<br /><br />Your heart will break, as you witness 17 year old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) attempt to hold her family together.  She has two younger siblings depending on her, and a mother who has disengaged from her surroundings almost to the point of catatonia.  When Ree's dad goes missing, jumping bail, she begins the fight of her life to save their farmland.  She spirals deep into the 'old boys' illegal activities---cooking methamphetamine.  Secrets abound, threats erupt, and several of her own kin turn on her.  You will cry with Ree; you will cheer with Ree. There is no setback, short of death, that will keep her from her mission to save her family.  Her courage represents the best qualities of the mountain people, often seen in their spirited, women---those trying to avoid the strong hand of their predominately patriarchal culture.<br /><br />I watched this film a month ago, and I keep ruminating about it.  To me, this is the sign of a stellar production---one that stays with you, makes you think, and dares to remove you from your comfort zone.  Winter's Bone will remain one of my all-time favorite movies.with Ree. There is no setback, short of death, that will keep her from her mission to save her family.

0545128285|4.0|This is an enjoyable and easy to read book for Potter fans albeit short. It will only take between 50-80 minutes to read, but it's something that you can re-read. There are so many Harry Potter references that you need to have read at least one Harry Potter book for this to be worth while. Dumbledore does a commentary on each tale. Ultimately I would have given this 5 stars except that it was too short. Hey & let's not forget this book supports childrens charity.
B000069HKH|5.0|I've been a fan of Bruce and the E Street band for 25 years give or take a few, and this album for me is The Boss's very best.   It remains so even after 10 years of it's release,  mine and my husbands absolute favorite. It has also inspired me to expand my Springsteen collection far beyond the Born in the USA of my teen years when I first became a fan.  I now own most everything Bruce has released on DVD and CD, and even got to seem them live in Ohio a couple of years back---WOW!   The songwriting is incredible and there really is not a bad song on it.  It is an album that you can put on in the house,  listen to and ENJOY as well as be transported to another time and place.  It truly is very, very good and soul wrenching.    Some of the standouts for me:  Nothing Man--a beautiful, breathtaking song, Empty Sky--Full, Rich sound, Further on up the road--simply Amazing, Your Missing--haunting, heartbreaking.  You won't be sorry with the purchase of this album!!  It transformed us from casual listeners into a hard core lifelong fans!!     Great Job Bbbbrrrruuuuuuuccce and the E Street Band!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000RC129Y|5.0|I don't read horror, so I don't read Stephen King.  Until now.  On a whim, I picked it up and before I knew it, I was a Stephen King fan.  This guy can write!  This part memoir, part how-to book, reads fast and covers every emotion you can think of.  S.K. has not led an uneventful life.  More like a self-destructive life.  But then you're out of the woods and into a beautiful world of clear thinking and crisp writing advise.  He doesn't like adverbs.  He doesn't like the passive tense.  What's new about that, right?  It's the way it's written, folks.  Beautiful.  Entertaining.  Clever.  Kill the four letter words, which I find distracting, and this is poetry.  I've written in this book, highlighted key phrases in this book, and will keep this book by my computer as long as wind blows and grass grows.  But I will not read his horror stories.
1582406723|2.0|As a warning right off the bat, there may be some SPOILERS in here.    From what I have read in other reviews and articles, Robert Kirkman is a brilliant writer, and The Walking Dead is a masterpiece. These statements could not be farther from the truth. Kirkman's writing is painfully awful. His dialogue is repetitive, obvious, simplistic. His characters only seem to communicate through lengthy expository statements in which they describe exactly what they are preparing to do. Then they do it. Pretty soon, they're talking about what they just did. His characters take three to five sentences to express things that could be conveyed clearly and much more effectively in three words. Characters often act contrary to common sense. They are, in fact, often stupid, but somehow they survive for months. Many of them are so annoying that I was glad to see them die in Volume 8. The pacing is also poorly done, though this may be a symptom of the collected trades. Time leaps from event to event, often skipping weeks between pages, with no notice until a page or two after the fact. This often happens right before important character moments, probably because Kirkman is more comfortable summarizing these conversations than actually taking his characters through them.    I have read several of Kirkman's works (Marvel Zombies, Ultimate X-Men) and these problems are prevalent there, too. I have no idea how he has become celebrated as a talented writer. Robert Kirkman is the worst comics writer I know of to achieve the level of success that he has. It pains me how few people realize it.    To his credit, Kirkman can come up with events. Many inventive and entertaining things happen in this series, particularly in Volume 6. If only they were written by someone who actually knows how to write.
B004498KPU|5.0|Michael Jackson's Vision is truly worth buying for any fan of MJ. It has superior visual quality and sounds perfect. It's presentation is worthy of that of Michael Jackson and his estate. I'm only a bit dissapointed in a few aspects. For once, it doesn't have the full version of \\"Ghosts\\", which has a longer storyline and this collection just shows a standard video. The video for \\"Once More Chance\\" isn't really worth watching, not is \\"Cry\\". \\"Once More Chance\\" only shows Michael filmed from his back, and you never see his face and doesn't have any storyline - same for \\"Cry\\" - Michael isn't shown at all. It's just people holding hands across America. The reaminder of the showcase it the best Michael has to offer and much restored and superior visual quqlity like never seen before.     Note to the Michael Jackson Estate: Please release concert video's of Michael Jackson in Concert, but digitally enhanced. You'll make millions for the estate!!  I would live to have Videos of the Victory, Bad, Dangerous and History tours as part of my MJ video colletion.    Thanks in advance.

This is just to say that if you have ever watched several movies and they have made you think of, or want to watch, other movies...then you may find out what I have just recently found out. The music composer may just be the same person for all those movies. Danny Elfman is one of the greatest composers I have ever come across. So much so, that I have even decided that Danny was worth my money. That's right, no stealing from the internet or listening on YouTube. He earned my money and has done it so well, that I have no bad feelings taking it out of my pocket to give it to him. I hope he continues on with many movies and even makes a few more theater stage performaces(Serenada Schizophrana). Check out all of his work if you can. You wont be disapointed!

B0027BOL4G|4.0|What did I know before genetic modification and its effect on the public before I initially viewed this film?  What's more, what did I know about the factors involved with mass production of our nation's (and world's) food supply?  In all honesty, not too much. Though, I did a brief research paper/documentary film, while a student of biology in high school (in the mid 1990s) on the moral and scientific implications of genetically modified produce that was being engineered and churned out into supermarkets on a nation-wide (as well as global) scale. The idea of tomatoes \\"immunized\\" with protein derived from fish enzymes, to make them bigger, redder and quicker to ripen on the vine was almost a joke - but, a very bad one indeed. When you watch FOOD, INC. it sobers us all to the reality (and danger) of mass production on the consumer's side, as well as those directly engaged in production and distribution (farmers, companies and stores that carry food laden with GMO's and hormones, etc).<br /><br />We are presented with stark contrasts, in this piece of documentary insight. On one hand, we see the source of our nation's meat - chickens, pigs, cows - in almost unlivable situations, while cooped up in rooms that are barely breathable, where sanitation is non existent and the ethical/business practices of the parties responsible are nothing short of appalling. Visceral imagery is presented of hormone and water plumped chickens, who are all entrapped in one dark, cold, dirty silo, barely able to move a quarter of an inch. They are then heartlessly prepared for the market (execution style) with no consciousness of the effect of breeding and killing practices and how they might ultimately effect the health of the consumer eating them, fried and dressed, on the dinner table, just a month or two down the line.<br />We see appalling depictions of the reality of pig farming (details so disgusting I will not divulge here), as well as the effect of super powers (like Monsanto) on farmers in the Midwestern United States, as well as on a global scale. By now, many people are well aware of the evil and tremendous amount of power that this company wields in our world - agriculturally speaking. I think it is safe to say that 75 % of our nation's food (as well as food that is mass produced internationally) comes from production companies that buy seed (or are made to buy seed) from this company. Unless, of course, the consumer or market/grocery store has access to locally grown, non - GMO based produce (that doesn't merely mean \\"organic\\" sometimes).<br /><br />The film also examines how people have gone organic over the decades, how it got started with companies like Morningstar Farms (distributors of soy based products - like veggie bacon and buffalo wings) and Stonyfield Farms (distributors of yogurts). Though, it is intriguing and even inspiring to see how the two (aforementioned) companies got their start in their industries, it is also a cautionary reflection of the \\"go Organic\\" approach to mass production. Morningstar Farms is owned by Kellogg Company (cereals, etc) and Stonyfield Farms sells their products to Walmart. As I learned of this, I couldn't help but feel cynical.  Also, where do you suppose Kellogg gets their supply of grain for, say, corn flakes?  I will let you come to the answer of your own accord.<br /><br />Watch this film - it will shed some light on a very important topic - our food, how it is being produced in this \\"Fast Food Nation\\" and why (to paraphrase the old adage) we truly are what we eat.he Midwestern United States, as well as on a global scale.

B001NLKT60|3.0|This is a good time-pass thriller. The author had already made up his mind that Lisbeth needs to be portrayed as a demi-god, and stuck to that end quite faithfully. As with all average authors in this genre, Larsson kept the characters black and white. Those who are bad, are always evil, corrupt, or plain incompetent. This book is an easy read also because there are a lot of paragraphs that are quite irrelevant to the overall plot and those can be easily skipped without losing track of the story - and besides, they do not offer anything more that some mundane conversation or uninteresting commentary on the characters. In the end, the readers looking for a feel-good story will get their money's worth. Mathematicians and computer scientists are recommended to steer clear of the whole triology. Physicists can breathe easy that Larson did not unleash Lisbeth's phenomenal brain on the unsolved problems of the mechanics of turbulence or quantum dynamics.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Though, it took me a few years to finally get around to watching this film, I am so glad that I did. As they say, it is better late than never. Or, in my case, it was right on time. Spending years as a care giver for my grandmother, with my mom, for well over a decade, I know well the state of our nation's health care situation - not only in terms of trips to the emergency room, but, also how support is offered (or not at all) to those in the position of either requiring care or merely offering respite to those primarily responsible.<br /><br />Michael Moore (Fahrenheit 9/11, Bowling for Columbine) presents an excellent framework for this very important film on an invaluably important topic. We see the stark realities of people in our nation of the United States - how people who have horrific injuries/accidents (example: losing a finger in a saw accident) are forced to choose WHICH finger to save because of the great cost to the patient (I am talking tens of thousands of dollars) for one digit alone!  We see how health care is being regulated in nations like France, England and Cuba. Though, the generalized message that keeps resurfacing over and over is that the United States is a waste land, in terms of patient care (that includes how insurance companies run their shady games with people who have terminal conditions (like cancer), and many have criticized him for his heroic portrayal of Cuba (yes, for some, this is still a country that the United States has no business even interacting with due to the Castro dictatorship and other factors), this film is a very important slice of life piece. We see how cold hearted the so called \\"caring profession\\" has become, as well as being preposterous and even laughable in its practices - example: charging a newborn baby for his own DELIVERY.  Many of the examples Moore presents as dysfunctional instances (that are only the tip of the ice berg) in our United States culture and the interactions between patient/client/customer, doctor/doctor's office and insurance provider leave me nothing short of speechless. Some of the accounts (presented here in interview/testimony) seemed more than a little parallel to the practices of the mafia and how they feel comfortable cutting people/connections no longer \\"of use\\" to them - politically speaking, ethically speaking. It definitely gave me a new awareness of the effect of no insurance on the lives of thousands upon thousands of people with chronic health conditions, diseases and afflictions.<br /><br />Though, on the other hand, as I see how health care practices are abroad (Europe, Cuba), I had to ask myself just how fair those depictions were/are  (as well as how accurate). I recall Moore was harshly criticized for the consistent tone throughout the piece that the United States is basically a miserable excuse for a nation, in terms of our health care practices, and how virtually every other country on this planet presented in the film is staggeringly superior and more aware of the importance of compassion, service and professionalism, as well as ethical responsibility. A perfect example is in England, when he depicts the experience of a patient in the Emergency Room/Urgent Care unit as opposed to the experience of an American in the United States, having to maneuver the system here. In that European nation, he illustrated the wait time as being smooth (almost non existent), that medication was free and the attention to the individual was perhaps most important of all. Also, he presents an instance where a young American woman defects to Canada, purely for health care purposes - even is willing to marry a Canuck to seal the deal.<br /><br />As always, Michael Moore intersperses dashes of his rollicking sense of humor with cold, hard facts about the state of global health care practices (granted, this was several years ago). I recommend you see this film for its historical merit, also for its engaging approach to storytelling.  Bravo, Mr. Moore. Bravo.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|Thank you Bruce for this great set!  \\"Darkness\\" has always been my favorite album and this box set is amazing...  They say things happen in 3's so now I await for the re-release of \\"The River\\".  Thanks for always giving your fans your best.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is an amazing television series cancelled way before it's time. The actors are amazing and I can watch it for hours. Simply a fun western in space!
B002NHIK1E|5.0|The first three or four episodes were almost painful to watch and I had to force myself to continue with the series.  But, once the background was established, the show really took off and I couldn't stop watching. Damon carries the show and you can't help but love to hate him.  Initially, I thought he was going to be the usual villainous vain and shallow character, but as the plot develops, the dynamics between him, Elena, and Stefan become quite complicated and intense.  Overall, true to the genre, but enough twists to keep you guessing.
B0045QE3GM|5.0|Honestly, this sounds like a great Roxy Music record. If you like Bryan Ferry's solo records & Roxy's 'Avalon', you'll like this record. The songs are sultry, haunting, and danceable in the way only Bryan Ferry can be. His solo records really depend on who he has play on them and he put together quite a collection of great artists for Olympia. Stop reading this, listen to the samples, and buy the record!
B0042816YK|1.0|This is a looooooooooooooooooooooong boring movie about a self-obsessed woman who really doesn't appreciate how good her life is.  Julia Roberts does her best, but this character really needs to look beyond her own self-absorbed 'worries' and do something for others.  Couldn't wait for the movie to end - I'd well and truly seen enough after the eat and pray phases. Avoid this movie and if you see the author of the book coming in your direction - get out of the way before she starts griping!

B004ASVS0E|4.0|So much Christmas music is given a soft-focus, shlocky treatment these days that it is truly refreshing to hear a Christmas album that sounds so raw in places.  Annie Lennox's voice is not as accurate as it used to be--I don't think it does any good to pretend otherwise.  This leads to an occasional moment where the exposed voice sounds quite rough.  The genius of this album is that Annie works with the strengths and weaknesses of her voice, crafting careful arrangements and overdubbed harmonies that compliment the material and her voice.  She sounds best on the songs she has chosen to sing at full throttle, especially \\"Lullay Lullay,\\" which is a terrifying song from a passion play about the murder of children.  It is so often arranged to sound pretty, but Annie's version pays careful attention to the meaning of the material, and her version of the song is the most thrilling thing on the album.  It is clear that Annie isn't just singing these songs--she is fully interpreting them.  She makes \\"Silent Night\\" sound fully heartfelt and sincere, when so many versions of this song sound overdone and ill-considered.  The real stand-out element of the album is the arrangements--Annie takes familiar songs and renders them new again through her consumate musicianship.  Even when her voice sounds a little strained, like on \\"Il est né le divin enfant,\\" the creative arrangement and the participation of the African Children's Choir make the song a success.  There are a couple of songs on the album that I will probably skip, and I'm not a fan of \\"Universal Child,\\" which pales in comparison to the enduring quality of the other songs on the album, but on the whole this is heads-and-shoulders above the typical pop holiday release.
0670021652|1.0|I agree with one of the other reviewers I believe Liz Gilbert got lucky with Eat,Pray,Love in a huge way.  Committed should have been written by Liz and dumped into a box, for her eyes only.  Once again Elizabeth Gilbert is writing a book based upon her own thoughts and clear cynical outlook on marriage.  I wonder how one of the other reviewers could equate Gilbert with the term feminist, Gilbert is the further-est  thing from a feminist. She herself states that she never spent time reflecting or discovering her own female-ness as she puts it. I think this book is a horrible mess it reflects the mess of a divorced woman afraid of commitment. I especially dislike how she treats the custom of marriage according to other cultures. To suggest that Christians at one time dis-liked or discouraged the idea of marriage reveals her ignorance and prejudice, I do not suppose she has heard of the bible or any other religious text for that matter. Gilbert is making more money now then many other people, sadly she got lucky on this one, I am convinced there are better writers with better texts out there that will never get recognized what a shame. I didnt enjoy this work at all.
B002K9CVZ6|3.0|Several friends of mine suggested that I read \\"Born to Run\\".  They had read it and loved it.  I kind of liked it but not at the same level as my running friends.  I would not suggest this book unless you were either a runner or interested in runners.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|I have loved the BeeGees music since I was in highschool in the very early 70's. Had a little transitor radio that I would put to my ear and would love when the BeeGees music was played. I still love the BeeGees and love this CD set. For the last 6 months I have had 6 BeeGee Cd's in my car. Had to take 4 out so I could put these four in. This is a wonderful set. I love that Andy Gibbs music is included. Listening to Maurice CD brings tears to my eyes. Robins songs are great. Barry, I have always loved his music. Can listen to his songs all day long. I am 56 yrs old and still can listen to \\" More Then a Woman\\" and \\" Too Much Heaven\\" and \\" Love So Right\\" over and over again.   Love the little book that came with this set.   Thankyou Barry and Robin.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games was different than any other book I'd read before, and I enjoyed that. The plot line was fresh and the characters alive in the country of Panem. I work at a library, so I knew about the book when it came out, and of course, heard and saw the hype over this book. Then Catching Fire came out, and same thing. Still, however, I had not read the books, thinking that it was something it was not. I didn't think it was age appropriate for me- by this I mean I presumed the book was for younger children. But then my teacher read it, and began to talk about it all the time, as did my best friend, so I picked it up.  I couldn't put it down! I was so intrigued by the plot and the characters that now I am reading Mockingjay, the third book it the series. I recommend it to everyone who needs something good and different to read!
B0031R5K68|3.0|The book was a fum quick read, with some interesting ties into d.c. symbology. Unfortunately this fun is ruined by a predictable storyline and blunt plot devices. I felt like the only point of some of the characters was to simply advance the plot. Meh Is a perfect description.

B000001FYL|5.0|As I understand it, the story goes that Jon Bon Jovi was asked by the producers of this movie if they could use \\"Wanted Dead Or Alive\\" in their soundtrack. Bon Jovi told them that he didn't think it fit, being too \\"modern day\\" for the film. He did, however, offer to write a song specifically for the movie that was more befitting to the story. What resulted was the much more appropriate \\"Blaze of Glory\\". But, being Jon Bon Jovi, he didn't stop there. He was so inspired by the movie and its predecessor he ended up writing a whole album's worth of songs. With help from great musicians like Elton John, Jeff Beck, Aldo Nova and Little Richard he conjured up some really good songs that are well produced and very relevant to the subject matter at hand. Along with the title track my favorite songs are \\"Justice In The Barrel\\",\\"Santa Fe\\" and \\"Blood Money\\"(which Jon wrote \\"for Bob Dylan\\", who had previously written the soundtrack to \\"Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid\\"). This is not the typical Bon Jovi record, nor should it be. But if you like his band you will probably like this solo effort just as much. I certainly do.
B000I2J6K0|2.0|This video is terrible.  I have turned it on twice to try to do it and just can't.  The filming is just terrible.  It's filmed in her living room, which is fine.  It gives you a sense you can do it at home.  However, the lighting is terrible.  The sun is in your eyes and just incredibly shadowy.  Besides that she uses her furniture for all of the exercises.  Again, you think great.  You'll be able to do this at home.  That is probably the case if you have traditional furniture, sofa, coffee table, and chair.  However, I have an automan instead of a coffee table, my couch is against the wall.  So?  Other than that it is just boring, with elevator music playing in the back ground.  A positive is that it does look like a good work out.  I do a lot of exercise with videos at home.  So I can see that it looks safe and has a good intensity.  I just couldn't stand to watch the thing.

B004132HZS|5.0|- Sherlock Holmes: \\"Shut up.\\"<br />- Inspector Lestrade: \\"I didn't say anything.\\"<br />- Sherlock Holmes: \\"You were thinking. It's annoying.\\"<br /><br />A proud man is ex-Army doctor, John H. Watson. But he is neither so proud nor his finances so sound that he'd turn his nose up at the chance to share rent on a flat, even if the flat mate should be that most peculiar and aggravating person, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. John Watson is immediately struck with the eccentricity of Holmes, and with his brilliance. And lest those Holmesian afficianados throw a fit, we first meet the Great Detective harshly applying a riding crop to a corpse in an effort to discover lividity, so at least we're reassured that certain things remain the same. Holmes still conducts his nasty experiments. Lean and saturnine, he is still very much the detached thinking machine, still the cold fish, except that, striding thru modern-age London as he does, some people assume he's a bit of a switch hitter.<br /><br />Somewhere, Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce are nudging each other in the ribs. After all, they did this first. In these contemporary times, Sherlock Holmes wages war on ennui, rages against boredom. He fills a role as Scotland Yard's unofficial consulting detective, a necessary tool in crime solving, even if the constabulary consider him a freakish prat. Some have wondered how Holmes would fare in the 21st Century, and the answer is: quite comfortably, thanks ever so. Holmes always was a scientific man, and very practical. Practicality dictates that Holmes would make use of today's technology, and we see him here applying the Internet and his cellie and GPS trackers and so forth. He runs his own website: The Science of Deduction. It doesn't get as many hits as John Watson's blog which is where one can read up on Sherlock Holmes' cases. To quote Holmes: \\"I'd be lost without my blogger.\\" Heh.<br /><br />SHERLOCK Season One compiles the three 90-minute made-for-television movies that aired on BBC One in 2010. Steven Moffat, who now runs DOCTOR WHO, is one of the masterminds behind this new series and his name is enough endorsement for me. This is a very cool re-imagining of the classic detecting icon. Some of the mythos have been stripped away. Steal away from the gaslit Victorian age. Discard the Inverness cloak, do away with the deerstalker cap, and also the notion that Dr. Watson is an utter baffled-head. What's left is the core of the detective and his fast friendship with the good doctor. Plonked in this contemporary era, Sherlock Holmes still runs circles around everyone. Only, as a nod to the sign of the times, the master sleuth has traded his pipe for heaps of nicotine patches. 221B Baker Street survives. But now it's perched atop Speedy's Sandwich Bar & Cafe.<br /><br />The show works because of the casting choices. Benedict Cumberbatch makes a right proper Sherlock Holmes, even if his name sounds like J.K. Rowling made it up; Cumberbatch exudes idiosyncracy and that certain imperious air that makes you just want to kick him around the room a little. It's spot on. Martin Freeman has the less showy role, but probably the more challenging role. It's easy to do flash. Harder to play everyman and to still stand out. Freeman's Watson is not at all dull-witted, is most capable as a man of action. He's just not as good at sudoku as his flat mate. These two actors generate instant chemistry. They are compelling together.<br /><br />The cases confound. The series comes rife with new material and a dark mood but with unexpected humor. There are nods to A.C. Doyle's classic mysteries. \\"A Study In Pink\\" pits Holmes against a clever serial killer who talks his victims into killing themselves, and if you haven't caught on to the word play in the episode title, this one is loosely adapted from \\"A Study In Scarlet.\\" \\"The Blind Banker\\" has Holmes doing a favor for an old school chum and investigating a break-in and a rash of graffiti. His sniffing around leads him to a locked room murder mystery and a circus. This case takes a wee bit from \\"The Adventure of the Dancing Men\\" (the graffiti as cypher sub-plot). Finally, in \\"The Great Game,\\" the world's sole consulting detective plays a deadly cat-and-mouse game with a mad bomber who leaves deadlines and clues via his victims. This, even as Mycroft presses him to recover missing top secret government papers. This is very loosely based on \\"The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\\" and just a whiff, just a whiff of \\"The Five Orange Pips.\\" Throughout, there's emphasis on showcasing Holmes' dazzling deductive process.<br /><br />Somewhere in all this, we meet Sherlock's brother Mycroft who, as he says, \\"occupies a minor position in the British government\\" (but we know better). And in the shadows - pulling strings and simply being a sodding evil sod - sits the criminal genius Moriarty who, next to boredom (and, possibly, trivia about the solar system), serves as archnemesis to Sherlock Holmes. In \\"The Great Game\\" Moriarty and Holmes finally have a proper chat. The chat ends inconclusively. Still, who needs gaslit lamps and horse-drawn cabbies, eh?<br /><br />The 2-disc DVD set comes with the following bonus material: 2 audio commentaries: one for \\"A Study In Pink\\" by the show's producers/writers (Steven Moffat, Mark Gatiss and Sue Vertue), another for \\"The Great Game\\" from Mark Gatiss & actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman; the unaired hour-long pilot \\"A Study In Pink\\" (later expanded and reworked into the 90-minute version that did air); and \\"Unlocking Sherlock\\" - the roughly 33-minute-long \\"Making Of\\" featurette with, among other things, cast & crew interviews, their thoughts on relocating Sherlock Holmes to present-day London, and comparison shots between the pilot and the movie.o a locked room murder mystery and a circus.

0743289692|4.0|This book is written by one of the most courageous people of our time, Ayaan Hirsi Ali. She is a woman raised in a devout Muslim family with all the expectations of womanhood in that culture. She grows up in several parts of the world but all the time within the bounds of Islamic confinement as she experiences it. Her sister seems to be the rebellious one in the family but Ayaan ultimately learns about the outside world and the freedom other women are experiencing and longs for the opportunities that her father and mother would deny her.<br /><br />This is a personal and general critique of the status of women in fundamentalist Islam and what it takes to break away from it. She loses her family as she separates from them and abandons her entire support system of Somali clansmen. She pays the price of becoming an outcast and even a targeted victim because of her actions. She triumphs eventually and becomes a spokeman for her cause even paying the high price of having to leave Holland because of life threats. She lives today in America but her life is always at risk. One wonders what it takes in a person to do what she has done. The book traces her life, her developing awareness, and the obstacles she overcomes. It is a very interesting memoir and an insightful look inside Islam.

0982633939|4.0|David Dodge first made his way into my consciousness in July 2010 by the reprint of his first novel, _Death and Taxes_. It was unexpectedly charming, witty, and satisfying--unexpected because I had never even *heard* of David Dodge, and was only introduced to him and alerted to this reprint series by a friend.<br /><br />_To Catch a Thief_, the next in what I hope will be a long line of David Dodge reprints by Bruin Books, is set in the post-WWII Riviera. John Robie is an expatriate American who has \\"retired\\" to the life of a gentleman farmer in the Côte d'Azur. Robie has some secrets, though, that if exposed, could land him back in a French prison; he is on an unofficial and uneasy reprieve for jewel thefts committed before the war, before he joined the French Maquis (anti-occupation guerrilla fighters). He needs to expose, and soon, the copy-cat burglar whose exploits threaten to send him and his compatriots back to prison.<br /><br />This is the novel upon which the famous Hitchcock film was loosely based. For David Dodge, a California tax accountant turned novelist and travel writer, this was his most financially successful novel. The protagonist John Robie is by turns a fascinating and infuriating character, as are several of the other main characters. Robie eventually understands his own irrational rejection of the trust of good friends by realizing that being a thief is a \\"state of mind,\\" which stays with him even when he is no longer thieving. Will he overcome that mental and emotional limitation? Will he decide to trust his honest friends? Will he see love staring him in the face before it's too late? These questions, as much as finding out who has been successfully imitating Robie's earlier felonious feats, easily consumed me until the last page (despite my own confident--and utterly erroneous--assurance that I knew the identity of the thief quite early on).<br /><br />I've written this review through the point of view of the woman I am, focusing on relationships, dialogue, and plot. I confess that the roof-chasing scene was as tedious to me as are car-chasing scenes in movies, but which I mention because there seems to be something for everyone: action, history, relationships, motivations, secretive manipulations, and exhilarating &lt;for some> chases. It doesn't have quite the fresh wit and laugh-out-loud moments of Dodge's _Death and Taxes_, but makes up by immersing the reader in the world of the fabulously rich, as well as the rough but engaging world of the French underworld and WWII freedom fighter.<br /><br />This edition has a lot going for it. First and foremost, we have to thank Bruin Books for reprinting a title (and an author) that has long been out of print. Randal S. Brandt writes a deliciously enticing and informative introduction. The margins are generous and the font easy-to-read. Suggestions for improvement: print on acid-free paper, and make available in a Kindle edition.<br /><br />The downside of this edition are the number of typographical errors, most of which appear to result from inattentive editorial review of scanned text subjected to optical character recognition. The large majority consists of random punctuation (e.g., \\"In the winter, he wore all the clothes; he could put on\\"), unnecessarily hyphenated words (e.g., \\"bag-gage\\"), and a few out-and-out misspellings (e.g.,\\"desk\\" instead of \\"deck\\").<br /><br />These errors do not however significantly detract from reading pleasure. If you saw the movie _To Catch a Thief_; if you enjoy novels in exotic places; if you like glamour and sophistication and clever criminals; if you like an absorbing but not overwhelming plot; if you like good dialogue, good character development, and a good ending; then you must read Dodge's To Catch a Thief.

0307341577|4.0|I was really impressed with this novel, despite a few flaws, and look forward to reading more books by this author.<br /><br />First off, I admire Flynn for creating a protagonist who is decidedly unlovable.  I wish more authors were willing to create flawed, even unlikable characters, and make them interesting and entertaining.  I appreciated her dark sense of humor and I found her prose sharp and insightful.  In my opinion, Flynn is a young author with a lot of talent and one whose work I look forward to continuing to read.<br /><br />I did think there were a few flaws in the plot and structure of the novel, but they are minor and easily overlooked (although, they did result in a four star rating rather than a fully enthused 5 star endorsement).  With regard to the story structure; having the narrative flashback between the past (the day of a family massacre in 1985) and the present (the surviving victim looks into the murders) worked on some levels but I found the present day story lost relevance for a while because very little was revealed in those chapters.  The 1985 story drove the novel forward and for a while our protagonist in the present day story was simply finding out things that we had already learned from previous chapters.  I also found that a big part of the mystery of the massacre was revealed a little randomly and was far too coincidental, making it pretty anticlimactic.  There were some parts of the resolution that I wasn't completely convinced would happen and some character behavior that struck me as a little too improbable.<br /><br />All in all though, this book was a breath of fresh air for me. I am now officially a fan of Gillian Flynn.  I like my crime fiction dark and ugly, and Dark Places delivers.  This novel won't appeal to everyone but if you appreciate flawed and unlikable characters, small touches of morbid humor and disturbingly gruesome violence this novel will appeal to you.

Sting's use of a full orchestra (who artfully move along w/the music in choreographed sequence while playing, brilliant), adds layers of audio depth to his voice in a superbly complementary way.<br /><br />b) Dazzling camera work, the dp did a great job in capturing the performance with a variety of shot angles, and technically this is one of the very sharpest reference-quality blu-ray DVD concerts I've seen, of dozens.  Absolutely crystal-clear visuals... the camera work and image quality are outstanding.<br /><br />c) Hearing Sting perform favorites like King of Pain, Roxanne, and Every Little Thing She Does is Magic, plus his top solo songs was a lot of fun, having Branford Marsalis on horns was a big plus as well, they always work great together.<br /><br />d) Words that comes to mind after watching this last night are classy, brilliant, intense, fun and outstanding.<br /><br />I've bought dozens of concert dvds this past year, this is one of the very best; nice to see Sting in world-class form with the backing of a top orchestra.  This DVD sparkles.  Absolutely highly recommended -- thanks to all who made it happen, and Sting especially thx to you for all you've added over the years.  Your songwriting and singing skills continue to add so much to the \\"soundtrack of our lives\\".  Great job.  A++<br /><br />To the craft,<br /><br />Ken
B002ZG98Q4|4.0|*contains some spoilery bits*<br /><br />Tangled, Disney's version of the oft-refashioned folk tale Rapunzel, is the studio's 50th animated film and one that is destined for classic status.<br /><br />The Synopsis:<br />This latest retelling begins with a tiny piece of sunlight falling to earth and a magical golden flower sprouting where it lands. The flower, and its ability to restore youth, is discovered, used and kept secret by Mother Gothel. When the kingdom's beloved queen falls ill, a search for the flower (apparently its existence wasn't *completely* secret) is successfully undertaken and the healing potion brewed from it restores the queen's health. The flower's magical abilities are also transferred to the hair of the queen's unborn child, Rapunzel. When Mother Gothel discovers this and learns that the magical properties are only retained as long as the hair remains uncut, she kidnaps Rapunzel and raises her as her own child. Claiming that she wants to keep Rapunzel safe from a frightening world full of danger and thugs, Mother Gothel locks her away in a remote tower. While her hair (almost a character in and of itself) grows longer and longer, Rapunzel blossoms into a surprisingly well-adjusted young woman and gifted artist who longs to see the world - particularly the mysterious lights that appear in the night sky each year on her birthday.<br /><br />Enter our amusing narrator, Flynn Rider, a roguish thief who has just stolen a tiara and is on the run from palace guards when he comes across Rapunzel's tower and takes refuge there. The very competent Rapunzel restrains Flynn, hides the tiara and strikes a bargain with him - she will return the tiara to him if he will agree to take her to see those mysterious lights, which he tells her are floating lanterns. Flynn agrees and the two set off on a rollicking adventure. Pursued now, not only by Maximus - a horse from the palace guard who refuses to give up the chase - but also by a pair of thugs Flynn double-crossed AND Mother Gothel, Flynn and Rapunzel learn to trust each other as they make one narrow escape from their pursuers after another.<br /><br />Comments:<br />Tangled is a laugh-out-loud funny family film that will thoroughly entertain both children and adults. The animation is stellar, the story engaging and the pacing excellent, never dragging for a moment. Rapunzel and Flynn are both charming and likeable, making it easy for viewers to root for them. Further, they are surrounded by a terrific supporting cast including tavern thugs with secret dreams and Pascal, Rapunzel's pet chameleon. But it's Maximus who truly steals the show. The expressive horse is brave, determined, sometimes petty, and hilarious. Every scene he's in is solid gold. I would love to see some sort of sequel with Max and Flynn trading quips - particularly since Max doesn't speak at all and the two still seemed to be doing just that through much of Tangled.<br /><br />I did have a couple of quibbles, neither of which significantly impacted my enjoyment of the film. First, the colors often seemed a bit too dark to me, rather grayed out. This impression may well have been exacerbated by the 3D glasses. (ETA: A couple of fellow reviewers have commented that they found the colors bright and vibrant when they viewed the film in 2D. It seems likely that my experience may have had more to do with the theater where I saw the film or with the 3D glasses - or a bit of both. This is especially important since I imagine most Amazon costumers will be purchasing this film in 2D. My thanks to Star Fire and Thomas Plotkin for their input - I really appreciate it!) Second, even though I felt they were well performed, the songs were, IMHO, largely under whelming. With the exception of the lovely \\"I See the Light\\", I felt they had neither the excitement of previous Disney showstoppers \\"Be Our Guest\\", \\"Under the Sea\\" or \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\" nor the memorable melodies of \\"Kiss the Girl\\", \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" or \\"Circle of Life\\".<br /><br />On the plus side, the film is rich in emotional depth and is blessed with a number of wonderful scenes. My favorite sequence begins with Rapunzel and Flynn entering the village and dancing with the villagers and continues on through their scene on the lake among the floating lanterns. Their happiness in the village, Rapunzel's sense of wonder (and ours!) while surrounded by the lanterns, the romantic song they sing as they realize they're attracted to one another and may be falling in love - it's all perfect. The lantern scene is jaw-droppingly gorgeous - well worth the price of admission on its own and the film's most effective use of 3D. Another scene that I loved for its poignancy centers on the silent communication between Rapunzel's parents as they mourn their lost daughter together just before releasing their floating lantern.<br /><br />I do want to alert parents to one element. The relationship between Rapunzel and Mother Gothel is difficult and layered, dealing with emotional abuse masked with concern and declarations of love. (Mother Gothel's frequent put-downs of Rapunzel, followed by a cheery \\"Just kidding!\\" had me clenching my teeth.) Young children who are used to a more black and white portrayal of good and evil may be confused by Rapunzel's oft-declared love for the woman she believes is her mother and by Rapunzel's conflicted feelings when she first leaves the tower with Flynn. This unhealthy relationship doesn't overshadow the film, nor does it steal the humor and fun from it, but parents should be prepared for questions children might ask and concerns they might have. These questions may not come until a second or third viewing, when children have already seen the scenes where Mother Gothel more explicitly reveals her true nature and so have that knowledge when viewing the early mother/daughter scenes.<br /><br />That said, I still loved the film and believe it's a great addition to Disney's animated classics. Lastly, let me just add a big \\"Yeah!\\" to the film's final moments when Flynn, back in narrator mode, reveals that it was several years before he and Rapunzel got married. A much better message for children than the more usual we-saw-each-other-twice-before-tying-the-knot which seems almost de rigueur in so many fairy tales.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Note: Author, editor and fairy tale aficionado Terri Windling has written a wonderful essay about the long history of the \\"Maiden in a Tower\\" story which, it turns out, predates the Brothers Grimm by more than 200 years. I found reading about how a story evolves over time and across cultures absolutely fascinating. (Essay is available at Windling's website.

B0040QYROK|4.0|The Bluray is the third version I've purchased & it's nearly perfect. It seems though that they must have gotten some parts late in their restoration and decided to include them \\"as is\\" instead of delaying the release of this copy. It's very shocking to watch a movie so clear to appear recent & suddenly have the image look all scratched, seeming to come out of a junk storage box. I know these are new scenes since they weren't on my older discs (although most new scenes look perfect).<br /><br />Either way, if you want to see this movie as near what movie goers saw in 1927 (maybe better), buy this Bluray. Beware of other versions:<br />The Hollywood Classics, Exelsior Collector's Edition DVD was horrible; the quality was unwatchable & so many scenes were missing, I didn't know what the plot was.<br />The Kino DVD was visually better & had tiles to describe missing scenes so I knew what was supposed to happen & follow the plot. That would be a good one to buy if you don't have a Bluray player & can find it for a good price. Otherwise I wouldn't buy any other disc than this one, unless you're willing to wait 2-5 years (or more) before they re-release this with one or two more scenes and the completed restoration.

B003UYUQZW|5.0|A mythological tale about a super acrobatic prince with a mouthy princess who sort of likes him.  Kingsley plays his role good but not great but he's so stereotyped these days that few people didn't see you know what coming.  While this movie is more about the special effects the story was done surprisingly well.  There are a couple of memorable supporting characters, too, and some actually witty and funny dialogue.  People who enjoyed THE MUMMY are likely to enjoy this picture as well.  LOVE STORY: B to B plus; STORY/PLOT POINTS: A minus; SPECIAL EFFECTS: A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: 11/23/2010; MY GRADE: B plus to A minus.

0446195529|3.0|Baldacci is one of my favorite authors.  In \\"Hell's Corner\\" I found a few items that felt a little forced with regard to relationships with Stone (would share more, but do not want to give away any details for future readers).      Overall, this book kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next.  A good page turner, but this is not quite one of Baldacci's greatest, and it is certainly not his worse.  The main critique is it feels like each twist had to occur to try to top the last twist.  There was one too many twists for this storyline and it felt forced.    If you enjoy the Camel Club novels, this is an enjoyable read.  I recommend waiting your turn at the library for it to be available rather than rush to purchase the hard-back.

B00005JKCH|3.0|Anxiously awaited by both comic and cartoon fans alike, Sam Raimi brings the extremely popular 'Spider-man' to life on the big screen which is true-to-form and a very rewarding rendition of this much adored action hero. Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast and admirably pulls off the dual role of shy newsboy by day, crime-fighter extraordinaire by night with style and grace. Kirsten Dunst is equally endearing as Spidey's gal pal as there are more than one Kodak moments shared between the two which no doubt will be archived in cinematic annals if romance fans have their vote. Yet it is the title character's battle with the arch-enemy Green Goblin, effectively played by veteran actor Willem Dafoe, which provides the many suspenseful twists and turns evidenced in their high-flying acrobatic dealings courtesy of STA CGI. While the much welcomed side plot involving Spider-man's subdued alter-ego (the mild mannered newsboy Peter Parker) adds additional intrigue as he entangles with envious friend and rival Robert Franco for the affection of sweetheart Dunst, it is the humorous (borderline silly but still funny) antics provided by J.K. Simmons as Peter Parker's Daily Bugle boss that contributes a huge amount of laughs in this enjoyable adventure that certainly sets the standard for first rate comic book to big screen transitions.
1441965904|5.0|I am not a researcher myself, but I do have to give presentations as I work for a company that has many international customers. I found it really useful because it helped me reduce my worries about the English language by showing me that I should:     *       write out what I wanted to say  *       use very short sentences which are easy to say (and also easy for the audience to understand)  *       focus on pronouncing key words correctly (the book suggests using the Adobe 'read aloud' function to help with pronunciation)  *       write a minimal amount of text  *       and much other useful advice.     The book also contains a section on 'useful phrases' i.e. the standard phrases to use in a presentation. For the first time I felt confident about my presentation, and also my boss was really satisfied. I would really recommend this book to anyone who has to make a presentation in English.
B000FVQLQQ|4.0|This is an outstanding motion picture telling the powerful story of the rise & fall, then subsequent triumphant rise again of Dr. John Nash. Russell Crowe is outstanding as the compelling lead. Film is visually stunning throughout as it covers over 40 years of Nash's amazing brilliant and often tragic life; a sincere tribute to a genuinely unique and interesting life struggle. Jennifer Connelly delivers a memorable performance as well giving brave portrayal of Nash's wife, which earned her a well-deserved Oscar in the female lead category. Yet the major credit for this well-crafted motion picture is the inventive collaboration of director Ron Howard's vision with the skilled production talents of Brian Grazer who took home Oscar that same year for Best Director and Best Picture respectively. Through their collective efforts they utilized Akiva Goldsman's Oscar winning screenplay in a clever and imaginative way to transform this sympathetic yet complex story into a delightful, pleasing to the eye treat that will engage all that screen this powerful biography of a brilliant yet flawed professor.

1423101472|5.0|OK so I also listened to this book and now I have to go back and read a couple I missed!  As for my son - I am getting nervous because he is making short work of reading this book as his idea of fun!  I had to run out late one evening just to pick it up because he finished book 4 and wanted book 5 pronto.    I don't know what I will do after he is done!  At this point I only see one new book on the market and after that I don't know if there will be anything comparable to take it's place!    Pure excitement from the beginning, well written, great story line.  A clear beginning, middle and end tied together so creatively.  Anyone who can get kids to lay down their controller and pick up a book is a genius!

I don't like the mood that emanates from it.

B000KJU182|5.0|Masterpiece - I give that to very few movies, but this is clearly one. It starts with Ustinov's scripted interpretation of Melville's posthumous novella. Then there's Ustinov the producer, director and actor. He wears all four hats with dignity and elan. Terrence Stamp's first movie as Billy shows why he became an \\"A\\" list actor, he's simply wonderful. Having said this, the film is stolen by Robert Ryan's portrayal of the brutal, sadistic Master of Arms, Mr. Klaggert. Watch his expressions as admiration turns to hatred. The scene on deck at night is worthy of Shakespeare. I knew the actor, I thought I knew what he was capable of, but I was so wrong. He should have received an Oscar for his performance. In real life, he was a great guy. I used to play softball with him and his two sons. In the film, he becomes the Devil incarnate and no one does a better job. No one.

Give this a try, it quite good.
B003UESJGK|3.0|I've never been a big fan of romantic comedies. They usually try too hard to be cute or are too heavy on romance and too light on comedy. Sitting through a string of romantic comedies when you're single isn't the best idea either as it just seems to remind you of what you currently don't have. But every once in a while a film labeled as a romantic comedy offers a little bit more than it lets on. Love & Other Drugs is such a film.<br /><br />Love & Other Drugs spends an equal amount of time giving a lesson in pharmaceutical sales that it does with the relationship between Jamie and Maggie. In between getting familiar with how easy it is for Jamie to get laid, we're introduced to how competitive it was for Zoloft to get off the ground when Prozac already ruled the world of anti-depressants in a 1996 world. Then a little blue pill came along called Viagra to help anyone with impotence and swept the world by storm. In addition to that, there's also a fair amount of screen time given to parkinson's disease as Maggie struggles with stage one of the disease as a 26-year-old. So Love & Other Drugs is basically a film about pharmaceutical sales while also giving the viewer an idea of what it's like to deal with an incurable disease at a young age first and a romantic comedy second.<br /><br />If the film still doesn't sound like the type of film for you, there's still a little bit of hope. Anne Hathaway is shown topless quite often in the film's 113 minute duration, so guys have something to look forward to if a girlfriend or wife is planning on making you sit through this any time soon. You pretty much see all of Jake Gyllenhaal as well other than a full frontal, so the ladies can oggle something as well. The real chemistry on-screen is obviously between Gyllenhaal and Hathaway, but also Gyllenhaal and Josh Gad who play brothers. Gad seems like a knockoff of Jonah Hill or some weird parallel universe version of him. With that being said, you can probably figure out that it's mostly emotional touchy-feely stuff between Gyllenhaal and Hathaway while the relationship between Gyllenhaal and Gad provides most of the laughs.<br /><br />Love & Other Drugs is probably mostly what you're expecting it to be, but it may contain more about pharmaceutical sales and parkinson's disease than the trailers let on. Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway do a decent job of making you care about the fate of a relationship between two people who try their hardest to pass themselves off as selfish jerks. The film is actually pretty similar to Knocked Up or a Judd Apatow production in general, at least in tone. Love & Other Drugs is still a funny, touching, well-acted romantic comedy that is sure to make a great date movie.al touchy-feely stuff between Gyllenhaal and Hathaway while the relationship between Gyllenhaal and Gad provides most of the laughs.

1400079276|2.0|Japanophilism's a clunky word and potentially pretty broad and judgmental, but it's hard to think of anything else to blame for Murakami's popularity amongst English-speaking readers.  I don't read Japanese so I'm going by the translation, but the prose in Kafka on the Shore is some of the worst I've read outside of teen-lit and airport fiction.  Actually, I've read some airport fiction prose that's better.  It's tempting to assign blame to the language gap but some of the problems here are integral to the structure of the story, such as characters' habits of going off on trite platitude-stuffed monologues (that one suspects are little more than Murakami's own personal musings) and the author's need to carefully explain what each piece of imagery and symbolism means, rather than leaving it to the reader.  Beyond that there's absolutely no style or flair to the writing - it's completely flat - and pages often stop dead to describe mundane details like meals or clothing that serve no aesthetic purpose.  The quirky, magical elements Murakami makes use of seem equally pointless and badly integrated.  This makes him come off as more of a poor man's Neil Gaiman than a writer of serious non-fantasy literature.  Not that that's a bad thing, to be sure, but it doesn't quite stack up with his reputation.    I'm completely lost when it comes to Japanese literature but for those interested there must be better stuff than this, I'm sure it's easy to find.  As far as authors that attempt something similar but are far more successful - and seemingly better able to survive translation - I'd maybe suggest some of the Latin American \\"magical realists\\".  Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Jorges Luis Borges, and Roberto Balano spring to mind.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I read several reviews and people's comments on this headset, most of them were highly negative or extremely positive. I was hesitant to spend sixty-plus dollars on a headset if I wasn't absolutely sure they were what I needed.<br /><br />This headset isn't solid as a rock, but it is NOT as cheap as a lot of reviewers have been saying. They are probably the most sturdy headphones I've ever put on, so forget your worries that they will fall apart as soon as they are out of the box.<br /><br />The next problem I often read about was \\"white noise.\\" I feel that some people may have bad stereo connections on their television or perhaps the headphone jack the headset is plugged into. I am currently using a Samsung 32\\" LCD T.V. with Altec Lansing speakers which I have the Headphones plugged into (to help control bass, treble, and volume- so far it's working amazingly well) I have played a little over 17 hours using the headset and have not heard the faintest crackle of white noise, so don't worry about that.<br /><br />The final problem I've heard so much about is the headphones being \\"loud\\" to other people in the room. I live in an apartment with 2 other room-mates. The three of us each have an entertainment center located in the living room. I was playing a movie so loud it almost hurt my ears and my closest room-mate said he could hear noise: not even make out what it was.<br /><br />Overall I think this product gets a bad rap. Its light, pretty comfy, has good sound, and the mic works great. Everything seems to be tight, in the right place, and works very well. If you have never bought a Headset, you CAN NOT go wrong with this one.<br /><br />::: Also, if you enjoy using the headset after a while you can buy the [[ASIN:B003O0KICS Ear Force DSS 7.1 Channel Dolby Surround Sound Processor]] to experience full 7.1 surround sound without any additional wiring or crazy setup.<br /><br />Do yourself or your gaming loved one a favor and buy this headset.

0316067938|1.0|I decided to read this book to find out what all the 'Twilight' fuss was about. I was fully prepared to make allowances and suspend cynicism for the shamefully expedient plot and characters, the intended audience, and the sequel syndrome. I was not prepared for the shock of such poor writing actually making it past an editor and proofreader in the first place. Had I progressed beyond page 40 of the novel (bearing in mind that it is printed in large font with wide spacing) before discarding it in total disgust, I would probably have completely lost faith in the publishing industry.    While I cannot speak for the other novels in the series, I found this one to be a pathetic indictment of the level of literacy of the author and of the umpteen million people who have read the novel. Adolescent sexual angst may well excuse the subject matter, but the total disregard for anything approaching literary craft or originality left me appalled. Had this text been sent as an unsolicited MS to any self-respecting editor, it would have hit the regret pile very quickly.     Publisher and author obviously on to a good thing financially, and out to exploit a captive market for every penny. But with so many otherwise illiterate people actually reading, why not take the opportunity to expose them to a quality of writing that has at least some merit, rather than the consistency and flavour of cheap bubblegum?

B002GHHHP6|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and decided to buy it for my husband's birthday. He had never seen it before and in the last two weeks he has watched it about ten times! He loves it and it is one of the few movies that he and I both enjoy watching!
B002VECLVO|5.0|Based on Christopher Isherwood's novel about an English professor grieving the loss of his partner of 17 years (a relationship never recognized by the partner's family), this film (set in October 1962...might ring a bell) has beautiful period sets, architecture, wardrobe, and lifestyles -- and makes clever use of color and close-ups to tell the story. Oh, and Jon Hamm (Mr. \\"Mad Men\\" himself) has a voice cameo. (Didn't like the toilet scene or the joke about the dog; other than that, a perfect film.)
B0042KZJR8|5.0|This 'Hollywood Edition' has twenty one great songs on two CD's, and every single one is wonderful to listen to.  From 'Baby You've Got What it Takes' recorded with Sharon Jones, to 'Haven't Met You Yet' sung live, Michael Buble outdoes himself as usual. I'm never disappointed when listening to this man sing, and can imagine him pleasing audiences for generations to come. Try him, you'll like him!
B003RUZKC8|4.0|Well, if you read the synopsis of this movie you would probably assume it was just another action movie.  You would be right.  But, this was also a well done, very enjoyable, action packed movie. As an very avid film watcher I gladly give this flick four stars.
B002ZG999U|4.0|I entered the theater fully aware that I would not witness any character development and would not have the benefit of a brilliant plot to enjoy.  This movie was billed as non-stop action with some of your favorite action stars and it delivered exactly what it promised.  The most interesting part for me was the excellent performance delivered by Dolph Lundgren.  As far as the acting parts go, his was the best performance and showed he actually has depth and emotion for someone seen as only a giant fighting brute.  I was impressed.    I agree that the unstable camera work and quick edits made parts of the action sequences hard to follow and difficult to watch.  I blame this on the \\"Bourne\\" series, which seems to have started a trend in the \\"unstable camera work will hide fight scene mistakes\\" style of cinematography.  Its not as bad as many other films out there, but there was just enough that it irritated my aging eyes.    I saw this movie three times:  Once alone to determine its appropriateness for my teenage sons, once with those same boys, and once with my wife.  We all enjoyed it, and admitting its failures, will watch it again once the DVD arrives.
B0040JHWKS|3.0|I like this collection. I'm excited to have this collection. But I think, after listening to this repeatedly for a few days that this is not all that I hoped it would be. Despite the claims of the Springsteen camp this is not the long lost album between Born To Run and Darkness, not the missing link that will join these 2 masterpieces. Bruce and Stevie and John have been talking about how wonderful these 22 songs are but keep in mind a few things:    These songs were rejected when putting together Darkness.    These songs were rejected when putting together The River (even though the River had multiple songs from the Darkness era and had musical styles all across the spectrum).    These songs were rejected when putting together the Tracks collection (4 discs!)    These songs were rejected when putting together the bonus disc of studio outtakes for The Essential Bruce Springsteen.    It is a tribute to Bruce's talent that his 5th rate songs can still be of pretty solid quality. But to my ears about half of this collection is a little dull; mid tempo rockers with unmemorable lyrics and unremarkable (though somewhat catchy) melodies.     All that being said I can say that there are about 6 or 8 songs that are pretty solid and make this set worth the low price. My general lack of enthusiasm seems to speak to how great Bruce's instincts were when he put together Darkness. In listening to these songs as well as Tracks, etc. I don't think there is a single song on Darkness that I would swap out for another. The original released album is a complete, cohesive whole that works perfectly.    But there is another issue that has been discussed in some of these reviews. Bruce has recorded overdubs and actual vocals onto most of these tracks. The more I think about it the more I think this is quite simply just WRONG. I love Bruce's work throughout all of his career. I will buy the next cd the week it comes out like I have bought all the others. But in my opinion there is no reason for a 2009 Bruce vocal to be on a song from 1977. I don't care if it supposedly makes the song better. I would rather hear an \\"inferior\\" version (or no version at all) than hear something that has been doctored and sweetened to make it more palatable to an unknowing audience. Again this is just my opinion, but it seems deceptive and contradictory to the spirit of this release. I think the reason I am not more excited when I hear most of these songs is that my gut instictively knows that I am not hearing music from Bruce Springsteen in his prime as we were lead to believe.
0446672653|5.0|Even the most hard-pressed skeptics should find this particular case thought-provoking, if not down right evidence of reincarnation.    Instead of simply repeating the praises of those that have written before me, let me just acknowledge that I further appreciate:    * The beginning of each chapter with quotes from some famous people that suggest they may have believed in reincarnation.  People like Tolstoy, Da Vinci, Benjamin Franklin, Plato and others.  * The end of many chapters are closed with some other cases or commentaries on histories that are both introspective and just as thought-provoking.    The case in this book does corroborate with other studies on reincarnation that state soul groups tend to reincarnation together.    -----    Journey of Souls - Dr. Michael Newton  Past Lives, Future Lives - Dr. Bruce Goldberg
B00445JSX2|4.0|This movie immerses you in the crowd, you feel the energy and power of a depeche mode concert, the camera work is clever, and if you want to know what it's like to be inside the energy pulse of a DM concert this is the 'slam-wham thank-you mam' concert DVD for you. Ignore the negative reviews about camera angles, those reviewers missed the point, this is a DM concert for the 21st century, i-phones everywhere, blurred in and out focuses aren't accidents, there a reality in a universe where everyone makes their own movie. The sound isn't as great as it could be but that's forgivable if you crank up the volume and immerse yourself in the show. Martin is on top form throughout, cool and controlled, looking at ease and really at the top of his game. Dave unfortunately looks tired, struggling and at times lacking the iconic status we know him for...even gollum-like on the final song of the show, but it still works and overall this is a great DM live video for the present day!
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|I didn't even know the Killers. Was channel hopping one day, stopped on Palladia and this was on.  I remained glued to the box for the rest of the concert.  Amazing atmosphere (I have been to many concerts in the Royal Albert Hall, but never one where the entire crowd is hopping like this!).  Great fun pop music. Excellent cinematography/ editing.  On a good screen and sound system its almost like being there... Enjoy!
B000WJSCZE|3.0|Making effective slide presentations (I am a Mac guy so I won't use the PP word) is a lofty goal. The central theme of this book is most presentations suck. The idea is that by simplifying you can improve your message. But check out my headline. This book suffers from the same issue as most slide presentations. The message is too cluttered to be truly effective. The authors web-site has the same message and less noise.    I will say if you by the Kindle version, play it on your Mac or iPad. The color slides are very nice and the impact is lost on a Kindle.
0312330537|3.0|First off, the narration on the audio version this book is fabulous and amazing. Brilliant job with the acting and the accents. Considering the sheer number of characters and nationalities involved, it was no mean feat. The one fact that speaks volumes about the professionalism of Mr. Bower, the narrator, is that he was able to keep from laughing over some of the the unbelievably tortured language churned out by Mr. Roberts.<br /><br />Some of the 5-star reviews evoke \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\", or other masterpieces of world literature. Some say he should win the Booker Prize.  Nope, don't get sucked in for one second. I've read \\"One Hundred Years...\\" about eight times and there is no comparison. Roberts spins a good yarn, no question about that, and I spent time wondering how much was true. The novel paints a wonderful picture of India. The book is a love letter for India, but it has some pretty fatal flaws.<br /><br />I stuck it out for all 30+ discs, but the author's only claim to fame has to revolve around his ability to torture the metaphor like  no one else on the planet. The metaphors were so overwrought at times, I couldn't help laughing. Really, overuse of the metaphor is not a substitute for good writing, but that is exactly what happens in this book. IMHO everyone who let this book proceed through the editing process without neutralizing this pathological abuse of the metaphor should be slapped. Take those horrible things away and you would have a simple narrative of an interesting tale. I would have preferred that by a long shot. He tells a good story, but I can't say that makes him a good writer. There is a big difference.
B003U9V6A6|5.0|Excellent CD.  I highly recommend both of The Script's CD's.  The best music I've heard in ages! I saw The Script live recently, and it was an awesome show.  When I heard \\"The Man Who Can't be Moved\\" off their first CD, it reached in and touched my soul, and I knew I had to buy the CD.  When \\"Science and Faith\\" was released, I couldn't wait to hear it.  Although, it sounds a little more 'produced' than the first, I love it just the same.  So many more good soulful songs from these guys (For the First Time, Nothing, If You Ever Come Back, This=Love, Exit Wounds, You Won't Feel a Thing).  Something in Danny's voice makes you feel the emotion behind the lyrics.  That is the surprising gift I have received from this band - stopping in this busy world to remember the feelings of love, heartache, loss, and moving forward.  I know this sounds gushy, but it is what it is.  Buy it now! :)
B00418NX24|5.0|I have the original vinyl offering on this album. This pressing will destroy you on a good system. My system is a little over the top giving me the experience of a lifetime! This offering of this album delivers hidden treasures within the recordings i had not heard in all the times I have listened to it. I played it twice just to be sure of what I heard. Fans of this album that still have a turntable should not wait to get this.
B0001XPZGA|4.0|Norah comes across in beutiful way on this vinyl pressing. Something very comforting and soothing from vinyl and Norah. Try it!
B00260HH3K|2.0|Let's get obvious out of the way: It's a complete failure as an adaptation of the manga/anime. Now I'm not someone that needs a film adaptation to stick to the source material one hundred percent because I know that's impossible (adaptations that try to do that usually come off as lifeless or stale). However, beyond using elements from the manga and anime, the film doesn't really have much ties to the original material at all. The entire backstories of Piccolo and Goku are almost entirely changed as are their personalities and motivations.  Most importantly, the spirit of the show is abandoned in an attempt to fit the film into a more commercial - familiar - package, which leads to this film's second biggest problem: There's not an original idea to be found.     Sure, Star Wars and The Matrix borrowed from other source materials but they used those things to tell their stories in a unique way. Dragonball Evolution, however, uses ideas from other films and vomits them out in the exact same way they went in. Everything from Spider-Man (a geek with super powers wants the hottest girl in school) to B-level Kung Fu films (finding your chi, being one with yourself, etc.) are ripped off without shame, preventing the film from having any sort of identity. This wouldn't bother me so much if this were an original screenplay - Technically, every idea has been done before - but the fact that this film has source material to draw from, yet uses all these worn out cliches in its place, is what ultimately makes this film such a failure. That's not to say the film doesn't have other faults, though, because its lack of originality wouldn't stick out so much without some other serious issues.    The production value screams that this film was shot on the cheap. The sets looked crammed, there's not much various in terms of lighting, the fight scenes lack any type of flair and the special effects don't create any sense of wonder whatsoever. As for the acting, Chatwin is a surprisinglylikable Goku and does the best with what he's given (unfortunately, that isn't very much). The other performances range from being non-existent (James Marsters as Piccolo) to over the top (Emma Rossum's super serious Bulma and Chow Yun Fat's overcooked Roshi). Then there's Ernie Hudson's performance, which is just too hard to define (what the hell made him do this?). Coming back to the plot, the fact that it's never explained exactly how Piccolo got released from his prison clearly proves that not a lot of thought was put into this film's story. I could also go into how no tension or antagonistic relationship is built between Goku and Piccolo to make their fight at the end mean something... but that's another review in and of itself.    Despite everything I just said (or really because of what I just said), the reason I gave the film two stars is because it's pretty harmless on its own merits. It passes the time if you have nothing else to do and since it was a bomb in theaters, it won't create much of a negative perception of the Dragonball franchise as a whole. Hell, Fox could make a reboot of Dragonball right away and people wouldn't notice because nobody saw this film (DB fans and non-fans alike). In its own little way, it's actually entertaining... as a guilty pleasure. Still, avoiding it is the best option because there are far too many genuinely good films to be watched.
B002QKZLZ6|3.0|I had my Plantronics Voyager 510 for 2 years and put it in my shirt pocket. Every time I bend myself the headset slips out. Two month ago I bought a new 510 headset and bought the Plantronics case at the same time. I thought I now have very little chance to loose the headset. I was wrong!  Here is what happened.   It is a good quality case and the 510 headset fit in it nicely. The problem is the belt clip. I wish they made it a loop instead of a clip. I put this case right next to my phone case, which has both clip and a loop,  on my belt. Within 2 month there are few times the case being pushed up on belt due to body movement. Mainly because it was pushed up by hip when I bent myself to the side. Also if I ware a jacket and zip it up the bottom of the jacket will pull the case up a little each time I rise up my arm.   So you guessed it, I lost the case and the new headset after 2 month of the use. Now I am ordering a new headset again and put it back into my front pocket.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I've been following this man since late 2002 and I am a bit biased because my heart is in the charity work he inspires, and that colors my feelings about his music!  That said, this CD is so exciting because he does pour his heart into the music and the lyrics tell all!  Musically, the songs are complex, diverse, and compelling.  Of course he could sing the phone book and I would listen, but would I buy copies of Josh singing the yellow pages for everyone I gift?  Probably not.  Everyone on my list is getting this CD for Christmas because he appeals to such a broad base.  We're not all soccer moms (I'm an engineer).  But this CD is very special because it is very truthful.  He is not singing words that have no meaning for him.  He has gone far beyond being a singer to being a composer, and that is part of what makes this CD so important for him (and for us).
0061537934|4.0|Who knew a dog could write such good a story.  A touching story told by a dog from his viewpoint on his life and the people in it.  If you love dogs, you will like this story.    While not a heavy, intellectual read, it is a very pleasant one.  As you read through it, it makes you wonder just what your dog would say to you if it could.  Without being the spoiler here, the ending is not at all what you would expect.
B003TVMIDO|5.0|Look, if you are a fan and want to get all the CD's in a nicely done presentation and in my opinion great sounding CD's then this is it. If you are going to just complain about Yoko and the release look elsewhere.     The music is timeless and the discs are great! Peace...
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Loved this film.   Of course, the stars are outstanding but so is the story told from a different perspective than one would assume.  The story of Nelson Mandela is compelling enough but this brings out his devotion to making South Africa one nation for both races.  Great treatment.
B003A9SYTW|4.0|Not their best but certainly better than half the junk that comes out these days. Just shy of a five star CD. That having been said, it is a good, solid CD with only two clunkers in my opinion.
193413712X|2.0|I'm half way through and I don't think I can get much further. In my mind, this is what happens when a writer fills himself up with words and phrases and ideas over the years, and they all explode out without much of a story or purpose. Don't get me wrong - I think Harding is an excellent writer - there are plenty of incredible phrases, paragraphs, and pages in this book.  But it's writing for the sake of writing, and the words overwhelm the story.
B0041V1R7O|5.0|I knew nothing about this one before the release other than the last one was good. This effort surpasses that CD. I highly suggest this one as it is one of the year's best. Many disturbing lyrics and music to match!
B004498KPU|3.0|The content of this set is great, but the videos are not even full CRT (old fashioned standard definition TV) size, they are presented in a box about 80% of the screen size with the outer screen border blacked out. The case says the content is formatted for Wide Screen, but I did not see any way to change the display ratio with my DVD player. So I am happy with the content and to be able to see it, but disappointed with the presentation size - I expected it to at least fill a standard screen :-(
B003XIO7ZK|4.0|These guys are different, but that's not a bad thing at all. It's metal in the classic sense. I was amazed to see how many albums these guys have as I'd never heard of them before. I will probably buy another one from them soon. Love the cover and artwork. Apparently the Grim Reaper is not only their mascot, but he also plays keyboards for them! The production on this album is very good and I recommend these guys to any one looking to expand their metal horizon.
0545265355|5.0|This is one of the best series I've read in a while!  I could not put them down!  I was so excited to get the box set. These are books that I will read again and again.  They are fast paced with edge of your seat action and great characters!  Loved them!!!
B002EWD08Q|5.0|bought this CD for my friend and she absolutely loved it. It came in handy when we went to see them live in concert. We were jamming to their music right before the show. Lovely.

0439023521|5.0|This Book pulled me in fast and didn't let up. I didn't want to put it  down! Take my advice, if your interested in this at all, buy all 3 books  because you won't want to wait for them!!!
B002ZG99A4|5.0|Action adventure, carnage and outright great action actor assembled into one movie.  The story is entertaining and enjoyed the fun.
B0000AUHPG|4.0|Wow! This is not your \\"run of the mill\\" western by any means but I will say this, \\"Sergio Leone is a heck of a director!\\"  Some the the scene set ups in this movie are really powerful.  I LOVE how certain scenes were presented to the viewer.  The cinematography is very impressive as well.  You really need to pay attention or this one can get away from you.  Claudia Cardinale is gorgeous, Henry Fonda is the worst of villians, Charles Bronson is at his \\"tough as nails\\" best and  Jason Robards is an understated but powerful character in the mix.  Sprinkle in a little greed, lust and gun play, stir  well and enjoy.  This one is a keeper!
B003PIUC02|5.0|Sparticus is a great story and this interpretation more that does it justice. So much more! Whitfield was an excelent choice for the lead roll and I was plesently suprised by the acting talent shown by John Hanna, after the Mummy. If there is a season two, and I pray that there is, \\"sigh me up Scotty\\". Based on the original story (and the Kirk Douglas movie) and given the pacing of this series, there could be 2, 3 or even 4 more seasons. A thought which I find comforting since there is currently so much boaring crap comming through my cable these days.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|Could not follow this very boring  piece of emptiness. George Clooney is a boring actor at any time but in this film he excels himself.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|This show is great, however, has anyone else noticed that the deleted scenes on this DVD are out of order? The ones at the end of the episode title actually belong to the NEXT episode. Weird. So to any of you who have not already seen the show, don't watch the deleted scenes until you've watched the episode that follows them. Enjoy!

B00122QCBG|5.0|I remember when my music teacher bought this album when it was first released and he said that the class was now going to listen to this whole album, we were all blown away by the sheer emotion and sounds that oozed from this masterpiece. It was like an orchestral ambient piece, continuing as one piece of beautiful music to bless those adolescent welcoming ears. This album will go on forever as one of the greats.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|The first time I heard \\"Hidden Away,\\" I liked it and thought it was OK. As I've heard it many times since, it has really grown on me and I find that I like it better and better all the time. This has been true for several other tracks on this CD including Higher Window and L'Ora Dell'addio. Incidentally, I also found that to be true for several tracks on Awake (the last studio CD) where In Her Eyes and Un Dia Llgara weren't favorites at first but I love them now.But there were other tracks on Illuminations that I adored from the first listen. The Wandering Kind, the piano piece, was definitely one of those....oh my what joyous music to chase any demons away! Love Only Knows is a really wonderful song with haunting lyrics. Voce Existe Em Mim is superb! And War At Home should become an anthem for a country still trying to recover from the Iraq War. This is a terrific CD and I am sure it will remain one of my favorites for many years to come!
1607050072|3.0|I got this book few days ago well the book from layout page looks very creative and have to admit some projects are good but most of them are like for kids level guess even they can do beter.She has used good ideas but not properly projected.I think the writer could have done the projects with more finishing and the book would have been just great.
B00448SE4S|3.0|Before this movie I had tired of Cera's acting but he does well enough to stay out of the way of ruining the fun. Runs a bit long for a tribute to geeks and video games but not a bad movie for a night in.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Movie review: This is how all superhero movies should be like; unbridled aggression and violence with a sprinkle of everything else.  Bluray review: Video is perfect. Audio is awesome.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|There aren't many movies that you can go out to the theater and just enjoy but this is well the asking price. I would agree that this is an action movie disguised as a intellectual exercise yet the blend makes it worth your time. Left the theater still buzzing about it.
B002PEP4SC|1.0|People who rate this highly are generally already fans of the show. If you are considering buying this book, watch the show first and if you are hooked, then you may like this book.    If you are simply looking for a good piece of crime fiction, look elsewhere. The dialog is trite, the 'jokes' are cornball and the characters are one-dimensional. The writing is guaranteed to make your eyes roll. Here are a couple brief examples (no spoilers) of what you can expect:    Example #1: \\"At noon she shouldered her bag, and when Rook stood to go with her she told him to get himself some lunch, she needed to go on this one by herself. He told her she should have some protection. 'I'm a cop. I am the protection.'\\"    Example #2: \\"'Pochenko,' she said. 'Where did you Pochenk-go'\\"    Finally, the author uses \\"impactful\\", which is NOT A WORD.

0307595579|5.0|Authors who are only published posthumously rarely get the attention they deserve', or any attention at all. Fortunately, such is not the case with the late Stieg Larsson's bestselling Millennium trilogy -- it starts off slow, and soon winds itself into a tight knot of tautly-written thriller and mystery elements. It's raw, bleak, intensely disturbing noir.<br /><br />In \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,\\" take-no-prisoners journalist Mikael Blomkvist has just lost his reputation, his savings and his freedom (hello, jail sentence!) after a nasty libel suit from an executive named Wennerstr&ouml;m.<br /><br />Then he's unexpectedly contacted by aged industrialist Henrik Vanger, to discover what happened to the guy's grandniece. He's offering evidence on Wennerstr&ouml;m, so Mikael has no choice but to accept -- and as he investigates the sinister Vanger family, he joins forces with Lisbeth Salander, an eccentric, abused computer hacker. And as Mikael unearths the clues to Harriet's disappearance, he also finds some skeletons long kept buried.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" finds Mikael investigating sex trafficking in his own country, and young girls who are sold into it. Unknown to him, Lisbeth is keeping very close tabs on his work -- especially since she was abused as a child, and now plots revenge on the sex traffickers. But when she's accused of murder and ends up on the run, Mikael must discover what lies at the core of these crimes...<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets' Nest\\" takes place directly after the second book. Lisbeth has been shot in the head, her malevolent dad Zalachenko is in the same hospital, and some nasty government forces want her locked away, as she was as a child. Her only hope lies in Mikael, who must unravel a government conspiracy formed around the young hacker...<br /><br />Finally, \\"On Stieg Larsson\\" is a solid accompaniment to this trilogy -- it's a nonfiction book that compiles four essays about him along with his email exchanges with his editor. Reading his own viewpoints on his characters and books really shines a spotlight on different facets of their stories, and why he wrote them the way he did.<br /><br />Larsson's books are a unique blend of old and new -- he takes the usual mystery/thriller tropes (locked room mystery, government conspiracies) and enfolds it in a ruthless, blistering look at modern Swedish society and sexual aggression. It's a dark, dangerous, unfair world where the truth is quashed, powerful forces conspire against individuals, and women are treated horribly -- usually shown via the eccentric, punky \\"girl with the dragon tattoo.\\"<br /><br />His prose is rather bleak and often quite gritty, and a certain brand of understated passion shines through -- the kind that feels the need to express itself even though it takes place in fiction. And while most of the first book focuses in Mikael, in the second and third Larssen's style splits in half -- one half is the more staid, ordinary perspective of Mikael and others, and the other half is the wild nihilism of Lisbeth (\\"If death was the black emptiness from which she had just woken up, then death was nothing to worry about. She would hardly notice the difference\\").<br /><br />Mikael and Salander make an intriguing odd couple. He starts world-weary and demoralized that he seems to care about nothing, but regains his passion for the truth; the only downside is that he's a bit Marty Stuish, since all women seem to adore him. And Salander is a mass of hurts and quirks -- she's a vibrant, wild genius who lashes out at those who hurt women, and has been constantly tortured by those around her since childhood (even as an adult, she's forced to have a legal guardian).<br /><br />Take your average thriller/mysteries, smother them in disillusioned, morally-bankrupt noir... and you'll have something like the Millennium Trilogy.

Take your average thriller/mysteries, smother them in disillusioned, morally-bankrupt noir... and you'll have something like the Millennium Trilogy. A hard read, but worth the journey.
B0042RUMEQ|3.0|Really Quick Review : If you like the singles \\"Right Thru Me\\" \\"Check it Out\\" and \\"Your Love\\" than you will LOVE Pink Friday.     OK, the rest of it:   Just about every song here is made for Top 40 radio and there a number of well-known stars here whose purpose is to maximize hit potential.  \\"Fly\\" has Rihanna, \\"Moment 4 Life\\" has Drake \\"Last Chance\\" has ...Natasha Bedingfield??     The trouble with this Black-Eyed-Appease-radio-friendly-appeal-to-every-demographic approach is that Nicki has superlative MC skills and a Missy-Gaga-like eccentricity and pairing her up with these poppy, sanitized tracks is akin to watching a former NFL linebacker compete on that Dancing Stars show. It's a round peg into a square hole.   Is Nicki an able MC? Of course she is -- you've heard her on \\"Lil Freak\\", the \\"Hello Good Morning\\" remix and, above all her verse on \\"Monster\\" which, as far I'm concerned, is reminiscent of Busta Rhymes on Tribe Called Quest's \\"Scenario\\" where he slaughtered everyone else on that track and set the foundation for his own solo stardom.     She's obviously influenced by off-kilter MC's like ODB and Missy, but someone (management, the record company?) is keeping her muzzled here with both the accents the \\"freaky\\" persona. And no doubt, you don't want her to get gimmicky, but that *is* a wide part of her appeal.     There's no \\"street\\" on this CD, no New York grit and grime, no real torque just a glossy sheen. And while she may not appreciate comparisons to Lil Kim or Foxy Brown, their first cds were triumphantly New York with rollicking, bouncy riddims and fat soulful beats.     I give this three stars, because even though it's not *my* taste, it is a professionally crafted cd. Hopefully her next cd is a little more freewheeling and lets more of her personality shine through.
1568461828|5.0|\\"A Christmas Carol\\" is not just A Christmas story, but one of THE Christmas stories -- not only is it instantly recognizable by pretty much everybody, but it's relentlessly copied and spoofed in countless Christmas specials. But taken just by itself, Charles Dickens' yuletide novella is a pretty bleak and bittersweet affair, with brilliant imagery and lots of ghostly weirdness.<br /><br />Scrooge is... well, a scrooge -- a professional miser who hates Christmas, goodwill, charity, puppies, kittens, his relatives, his employees, and virtually everything else except money.<br /><br />And on Christmas Eve, his dead partner Jacob Marley comes back, wrapped with supernatural chains, and claims that Scrooge is doomed to the same fate. But he has a chance at redemption: three ghosts representing will visit him that night, taking him on a guided tour of Christmases past, present and yet to come.<br /><br />So Scrooge is transported on a trio of hourlong trips through time. The childlike Ghost of Christmas Past takes him to his bleak childhood, when he was less jaded and hard. The jolly Ghost of Christmas Present takes him to people's homes on the very next morning, specifically of of his nephew and the poor miner Bob Cratchit. And finally a Ringwraith-like spirit gives him a glimpse of Christmas years in the future... a bleak and terrible future, unless he changes his ways.<br /><br />You can read plenty of symbolism into a story like \\"A Christmas Carol\\"; I've heard speculation about Dickens' father, the Industrial Revolution, spiritualism, and all sorts of other stuff. But at its heart, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the most powerful when appreciated for its story alone -- a story about a greedy, miserable man who redeems himself by learning to love all humanity.<br /><br />Dickens' writing is utterly brilliant here. Most of the book is bleak, grimy and painted in shadows, with Dickens only rarely holding back from showing the dark situation of England's poor. A great example is the symbolic children Want and Ignorance (\\"a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds\\"). As for the Grim-Reaperlike third ghost, it's the stuff of nightmares.<br /><br />But all isn't dark here. Occasionally Dickens splashes it with moments of crystalline brilliance (\\"It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and... its dress trimmed with summer flowers\\"). And as dark as the book is, Dickens offers hope for the future.<br /><br />He also does a brilliant job with Scrooge, \\" a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire.\\" Having worked hard to make us hate Scrooge, Dickens then deftly displays his skill at slowly revealing how Scrooge became who and what he is, and slowly redeeming him.<br /><br />This particular edition is graced with Robert Innocenti's artwork, and it is gorgeous: detailed, atmospheric pictures that are alternately full of bright shining colors and dark dreary black-and-white images (such as the third spirit wafting Scrooge over a bleak, lifeless church and graveyard). Really wonderful accompaniment to the text.<br /><br />Charles Dickens created one of the greatest Christmas stories with \\"A Christmas Carol\\" -- bah humbugs, merry Christmases and all.

B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|First time reviewing anything on Amazon.<br /><br />My taste in jazz is mostly \\"Charlie Brown\\" style- yeah, the music from the TV shows and I'm sure there's alot of this style that I would enjoy. Someone once told me this style was called Hard Bop, -not important though.<br /><br />What is important though is this CD/DVD set.  This 50th birthday reissue of the album 'Time Out'(Legacy edition) will ,I'm certain, be one of your top ten.  Along with \\"Take Five\\" and 'Blue Rondo a la Turk\\", other pieces I enjoyed were \\"Pick Up Sticks\\", \\"Three to get Ready\\" and all the others from the original album.  The 2nd CD is a chance to hear the quartet live.  The DVD is a chance to find out the Hows and Whys behind the album that Dave and the quartet created. To my way of thinking this should be done with most jazz music; to provide insight into a music that beginners find daunting and who don't have the technical experience to understand what is being achieved.<br /><br />To my audience of those beginning to listen and enjoy Jazz, (like myself) this would be a great choice to start with.  As one null-A enthusiast said \\"It's got soul and therefore truth.\\"  Certainly one could rationalize this music out, but in my opinion it's best to just feel it.<br /><br />As to my Amazon experience, everything was great along with the price of the new Legacy Edition.
B0041KOVUU|5.0|Ok so on this second of the limited sets they really delivered. I'll forgive Billy for that awful vinyl in the first box. The songs are great of course if you like the Smashing Pumpkins. The box itself is really nice looking and good quality. The Vinyl is simply stunning the images on the front and the back sides are both very cool to look at. It is a heavy vinyl with a nice quality gloss image on it. The cd is in a cardboard sleeve but even it has a nice and interesting image on it. All the little details were addressed this time. If you are a big fan and a collector then you need to buy this. I hope Billy continues to keep the future releases with just as much quality. I will have no problem buying them all.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|Bruce Springsteen is not for everyone. Most people don't get him, or get what it is he does, saying, you know, this guy or that guy can do a solo better, or this guy sings better. That isn't the point of Bruce, nor of his live shows. Even the most talented and able bodied guitar players can't match the energy level and enthusiasm that Bruce brings night after night after night! Finally, after many years of waiting, die hard fans like us, the ones who truly get Bruce, have been treated to Darkness on the Edge of Town, Bruce's most hard rocking, and at times, painful album, like we've never heard or scene it before.    The Notebook    Much has been made about the packaging already, so I won't say much about it, other then that its beautifully made and ingeniously designed. It is sure to be a great read for those who are interested in what was going on in Bruce's mind at the time.    The Remastered cd    Ugh. Alright, lemme just say, as an audiophile, I absolutely detest the way classic albums have been remastered as of late, and this cd is no exception. I had actually had a conversation with Bob Ludwig at one point earlier this year, and he told me the way he's being forced to master albums lately is deplorable, and this one, right here, is no exception. Now, a lot of people say they really like it, but, are they really even listening to it? The original darkness, while not an audiophiles dream, wasn't meant to be, period. It was meant to convey a sort of, down to earth realism. The remaster completely robs it of that. Believe me, I own one of the original vinyl records of this album, and it sounds 10x better. It goes to show you, no matter how much tape hiss you clean up, or how much of the bass you tighten, you ruin the dynamics of an album like this, and it just doesn't sound right. Sure you can hear more, but it doesn't sound natural, and in fact, ruins slow songs like Racing in the Street or Factory. For more info on this, check out the wikipedia article on the LOUDNESS WARS. That should explain everything.    The Promise    This is no doubt the biggest draw in the deck for some people. If you aren't a big fan of the boss yet, I would just pick this set up by itself. It gives great insight to Bruce's creative ability, and the styles he was fumbling around with at the time. The songs are impeccable, even if they suffer from most of the same sound problems as the remastered darkness. Someday we'll be together, gotta get that feeling, aint good enough for you, the breakaway and the bonus track, the way, are all standouts on an album full of standouts. Highly recommended.      The making of DVD      It was very nice seeing this on hbo a month ago. Now that I actually have it, its fun to go back and check out stuff I might have missed. Great insight once again into what was really going on at the time, and the concert footage they shop around is real fun to see.      Thrill hill/Asbury park 2009 dvd    The Asbury Park show was one done exclusively for this release. As a result, no audience to speak of, nor nills, patty, soozie, or any of the backup singers. Just the men who made darkness possible (minus phantom dan federici). Its really nice to hear the album done again, 31 years later, with a glorious sound mix being a highlight. The constant cuts from band member to band member though is annoying and unnecessary in my opinion.    The thrill hill stuff is hit or miss with me. The early stuff doesn't offer much, but the supplied concert footage from Pheonix is amazing. I think they should have released that show instead of the houston one, because the houston one doesn't sound, or look, nearly as good as this does. An excellent 5.1 mix compliments the hi def picture beautifully. Shame only four songs are included...The early stuff isnt bad per se, but it doesnt offer much we didnt already know or hear.      The houston house bootleg    If it weren't for the audio and video problems, this would have been a winner. You've never seen bruce and company like this before. At times he's like a wild animal on stage, and it seems like he plays forever. This is the bruce I always wished I could see, and he plays a set list that can't be matched. Fire, the fever, Quarter to three, just to name a few. I just wish it looked and sounded better.        Overall, this is everything Bruce fanboys could want and more. Despite some minor hiccups, my love for the man has only grown because of this collection. Treasure it...at least till the next one comes out :) (hint hint the river cough cough)    Peace
1579126278|5.0|Some say, if Agatha had never written another book, we'd still be talking about her as one of the greatest mystery writers for this book alone. How true! The story is fast-paced, with the most surprising ending. To be sure, since I have read 20 or so Agatha books, a chapter or two before the revelation I guessed who the murderer is. But this does not take anything away from the book. In fact, I can only imagine what a sensation it must have made when it first came out!<br /><br />Now I want to address one thing: some have accused Agatha of cheating in this book, so did she cheat? My answer is: No. After you have read the book, if you go back and read it again, you will see that she never actually gave you false information (I won't go into the details so as to avoid spoiling the plot). It is like watching the movie \\"Sixth Sense\\", when you watch/read it the second time, then you will hit your head and say \\"Oh, how did I miss that\\". It is your own perception and interpretation that misguide you, not her cheating.<br /><br />If you are starting out reading Agatha books, I highly recommend this book as the one to start with.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|What a touching and heartfelt movie. Clare Danes should have won an academy award for best actress. Very authentic portrayal of the time and excellent work by all the supporting actors. Very cool filmaking interlacing the images temple sees in her mind and real life. Really helps the audience grip how Temples mind worked. Amazing!
0425129616|3.0|I am a big Agatha fan (have read at least 20 of her books), but I am sorry to say this one is not the best. The story is a little too stilted, with some irrelevant elements thrown in just to \\"cloud the situation\\". Not as tightly woven as her later works. Of course, this being one of her early books, one must read with a level of tolerance and understanding; and it being the first one that introduces Poirot, it still is a must-read for the true Agatha/Poirot fans. Her later books, Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile, Death in the Clouds, etc. are more well-constructed and a lot more fun to read.
B000U1ZV3U|5.0|This is a great western movie. This has been one of my favorites for a very long time and still is.
0307594777|5.0|I greatly enjoyed reading each of the three softbound books individually, and just made my daughter extremely happy when I sent her the hardbound trilogy recently!  She had introduced me to the first book last summer,and was equally captured by the unique characters, the cultural settings, the suspense and intracacies of the   evolution of the stories. First class mystery and adventure escape!
B003XKPPOU|3.0|This Toy Story is not like the other two movies. It is dark and not really for children. It does not have the happy endings that the other two have. Not sure why they made this movie they way they did. Think they should have really thought about the movie before releasing it. We are pretty understanding of movies and do not freak out about most movies, but this one we will not buy.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|I highly recommend this toy - my 8 year old has been able to expand his creativity with this wonderful and traditional toy. No bells, whistles or video response. He can use HIS mind to create whatever he wants. The quality is exceptional, and I chose it because I did not want him to be influenced into building anything particular (like in \\"City Blocks\\") but just wanted his creativity to flow in the way that works for him!
B0000DJZ8R|4.0|As a teacher I use this movie in my classes because this is a classic film showing how people from the dust bowl lived, what they were forced to deal with and endure during that era and how families were tied together in a way that many modern counterparts aren't.  I have shown this movie in my economics classes and the students seemed to enjoy it and have empathy for the characters portrayed in the film.  This movie provides a unique experience to the students by visually engaging them and giving them knowledge through the film in historical perspective from a truly timeless movie that todays students may not see anywhere else during thier lives other than my classroom.<br /><br />The only fault i find with the movie....by the way not the actual movie itself, but rather the DVD is that the copy i ordered from amazon from a brand new sealed case gets stuck on two different chapters through the movie, and you can only get passed them is scene selection.  Which just may be this single copy that i ordered wasnt pressed correctly or something, so while i give the movie itself a review score of 4...the dvd itself gets a score of 1.  I'm sure amazon would have remedied the situation, but i didnt open this dvd untill about a year after order, because i already owned another copy.  Again just to be clear, my copy from amazon may have been the only one like this, but from my perspective as a consumer and geting this one  dvd gets a score of 1, however the movie itself is excellent, it is a 4.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|I Love this CD. Not big on Christmas music but I love Annie's take on traditional holiday music - easily one of the best.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Its a Wonderful Life is a movie that i watch every christmas, its a movie that shows good things do happen when things look thier worst.  Its a movie of hope, faith a shows how the events in a persons life and the choices that they make can have consequences years down the road, but we should always concentrate on the positive and enjoy life because everything works out in the end.  When its the darkest is when the single pinpoint of light is the brightest, and nice guys don't always finish last.<br />  This is a classic movie that should not go unwatched by moviegoers that love old classics or those that love christmas movies or by those that just need a good pick me up, its also headed by james stewart, and ive never seen a movie that he was in that was bad.  Make a new family tradition and watch this family classic every christmas, you'll be glad you did.
B003ZDO90G|5.0|Alice Munro is one of my favourite writers and she does not disappoint in this one. It is amazing to consider that nearly all of her stories take place in rural Canada and yet they convey all the dimensions and richness of human existence, feelings, emotions. Alice Munro is so incredibly skilled at creating a mood and making the reader feel very strong emotions just by describing the scene and the story and not really using any big emotionally charged words. She reminds me of Hemingway in that way.  My favourite story from this collection is \\"Dimensions\\" - a very chilling tale of dealing with a tragic personal loss. As a mother myself I found it heartbreaking to read and yet somehow uplifting as well. There is light at the end of every tunnel although maybe the light has a different quality than before entering the tunnel.  I heartily recommend this book.
B002ZG98PA|5.0|I would have to go back to Disney/Pixar's Up to find a movie I liked as much as Tangled.  It's a throwback to Disney's Little Mermaid/Beauty and the Beast/ Aladdin films where characters break into song (all composed -- including Tangled -- by the same composer).  Fantastic animation, character and art design and 3D all gel to make a great movie-going experience.  Highly recommended.
B003NFM3JK|1.0|Every year I look forward to watching  A Christmas Carol and over the years have watched many renditions of Charles Dickson's famous classic but this version is by and far the worst I've ever seen. I eagerly awaited Disney's version and had high expectations since Jim Carey was the voice of Scrooge. As I watched Disney's version I had a hard time staying awake, and my sister who was also watching, or should I say tried to watch, this version fell asleep half way through the movie. I found it difficult to connect with the characters and found the \\"spirit\\" of A Christmas Carol to be lost.
B0011ZWKSS|4.0|The atonal approach with fluctuating volumes and busy motives underlining the orchestral pulsating in some tracks is what i liked most. If only he had spent a bit more score time on tonal action, I think the album could have been better.     Also fat boy slim has great sounds. but something new would be fusing these with some jazz or rock. Just check E.S.T. or Fusio's album Perfect Circumstances for example.     Why not dance to some piano and stings for example?    Check this for example:     http://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Circumstances/dp/B0047XLQE0/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1290798488&sr=301-1
B00402FGDK|2.0|This set is not worth the additional cost of the Season 1 set.  All you really get in addition is a journal.  No extra features.
B0035TMUTM|5.0|Enigma is a unique music genre itself. Irreplaceable for me. Hard to find similar sounds. Maybe one that comes close is title \\"Cilled Out\\" in album \\"Perfect Circumstances\\" from Fusio. Please contact me if you know similar sounds you can recommend.
B002GU5V24|4.0|I bought this for my dad and needless to say it was a HIT!!! He was so excited for the DVD part of the set until we put it on and and all we get a photographic session. So disappointed. The music and sound quality is amazing but the DVD part was nothing like I thought.
B0034G4OVS|2.0|I was very excited to rent this film based on it's concept. The first 30 minutes or so is an excellent and fairly believable setup. I hope the following isnt a spoiler, but as you can guess from the cover of the DVD, three people are stuck on a ski lift hundreds of feet in the air.    The moment the film turns stupid however, is when they start throwing their winter clothes at the bypassing vehicle to get its attention. They could have thrown their skis or trecking polls... but no, they throw their gloves.    After an hour or so of sitting up there one of the guys gets this great idea to jump down. Naturally he breaks his legs and doesnt bleed out... which I found hilarious and medically impossible. The shock alone and normal bloodloss from a break that severe would have you dead before the wolves would come. (never mind the freezing temps, and how blood loss would cause your body temp and blood pressure to drop quickly)    I guess you could say I was bored after that... the constant screaming and crying was best watched with the mute button on.    I figure the movie is good for a date nght or cheap thrill, when you hope to console your scared girly by putting an arm around her. Thats why I suppose I give it two stars... as for the rest of it, it didnt hold my attention.
0143034901|5.0|From the first chapter when the Cemetery of Forgotten Books was mentioned, I knew that this would be an amazing read. Everything that you could want in a novel is here in The Shadow of the Wind--mystery, romance, lost love, humor, war, and hate. It's all in this stunning book, full of eccentric, unique, and entertaining characters, along with a brooding and atmospheric setting. It's phenomenal, and completely unforgettable. You won't regret buying this book.
0061120073|5.0|This was an unexpected discovery: I had seen something about this American teenage classic, but had no idea what it was about. It sounded rosy and childish, but turned out to be an excellent novel on the life -from age 11 to 16- of Francie Nolan, a girl who lives in Brooklyn. The Nolans are very poor. The father, Johny, is a handsome guy, but he suffers from a horrible alcoholism that only leaves him time to find sporadic work as waiter and singer. Katie, the mother, is a young, admirable hard-working woman, who has had a tough life and who finds work as housekeeper in order to sustain her children. Francie has a younger brother, Neely, with whom she generally is in good terms. The portrait includes uncles, aunts, and grandparents, depicting their lives and misadventures. It is a grand realistic fresco of life in Brooklyn during the first decades of the XXth Century, a poor Brooklyn populated by Irish, German, Italian and Jewish people.    But the main, and most interesting, focus is on Francie's inner world. She's an absolutely lovable character, an admirable, brave girl, self-assured and reflective. Francie enjoys going to the library to borrow books which she later reads in the peace of the fire ladder outside their tiny apartment. Although she is kind of a loner, this is compensated by the mental travels and the enrichment of her mind provided by books. The novel recounts the difficult passage from childhood into adolescence, her troubled and hurting love for her father, a pathetic failure who can't find the will to overcome his problems, and who stumbles from fall to fall until his destruction. It also recounts Francie's relationship with her mother: she suffers from believing Neely is her favorite, but she's never reproachful and is always helpful.     The tone is intimate, and even sordid aspects are treated with great beauty of language, depth in psychological description, and empathy with the characters. Feelings, values and situations are universal and allow the reader to really feel the story. Readers of any age beyond early childhood may enjoy it. It is about dignity, courage, effort, and authenticity without ever being corny or preachy.
B000JJCQ68|1.0|This is a great movie, it's on my top ten. However it was very disappointing when I received the DVD in such poor condition. It has so many deep scratches on it that we even can't play it. It was a waste of time and money. Beware of this seller. They say their products are in \\"New Condition\\" which is a flat out lie. It looks like a cat used this disc to sharpen her nails on. I will not use them again, ever!
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|On my 50\\" plasma this blu-ray is stunning to look at.  It was almost like seeing \\"Psycho\\" again for the first time.  It has been years since I've seen it in a theater, but this is one of the few discs I've ever seen that made me feel like a movie couldn't possibly have looked better than it does now. The picture on this blu-ray is state of the art and a pleasure to watch.    I do have one quibble and I realize that a lot of people are not going to agree with me on this.  I highly recommend watching this movie with the original mono soundtrack.  The 5.1 soundtrack is the aural equivalent of colorization.  I am not completely opposed to punched up soundtracks.  I have heard some that are subtle and effective, but not this one.
B003VSVWA0|4.0|Nice companion piece for the 2009 double disk release.  Great performances by LC and outstanding band/supporting vocalists.  If you can only buy one, spend a few extra dollars and get the 2009 set.  This is more for completist, but still great.
B00008G7UJ|2.0|The writer of this film posed as Jesus in a portrait in this film even though he knows that it is blasphemy. I find it shocking that the director agreed to include it. It's not right. The rest of the film is amazing. It is just not OK to pose as Jesus....The three stars is for the love theme, not the portrait that Romeo prayed to (the writer).
B002GY9F9K|5.0|The writers, actors and everyone involved in putting together such a series knew that there was people like myself out here who have a love for these types of shows. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
B002PMV9FG|4.0|As Harry Potter and his friends begin their sixth year at Hogwarts, darkness shadows them everywhere.  It seems that every scene takes place either at night or in some dim and threatening setting.  Even the school itself is no longer the island of safety it once was.  And although Harry and Dumbledore have managed to convince the wizarding world that Lord Voldemort has indeed returned, that fact alone is enough to make life much more perilous for our young hero.  While Dumbledore tries to discover what Voldemort's weakness may be and provides Harry with special tutoring to prepare him for the inevitable confrontation, Harry struggles to deal with the eternal teenage verities of love and the choice of career--but always with his enemy's lurking presence as his major focus.  A mysterious Potions text labelled \\"property of the Half-Blood Prince\\" proves pivotal to the story, and as the film approaches its conclusion, changes and revelations come thick and fast.    Like its two immediate predecessors, and probably inevitably, the sixth Harry movie loses something in translation from print, since the increasingly complex books can't be wholly transferred to film.  Indeed, disappointingly, although we do learn the identity of the Prince in the end, there are no details given as to why he called himself that, so curious viewers will definitely have to crack the book if they haven't done so already.  The soundtrack [[ASIN:B0028EQMW6 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]] is splendidly atmospheric and the effects, of course, are top-drawer, but the youngest kids should wait a few years before watching.
B000J103WK|5.0|I have always like the eagles and I am going purchase the video hell freezes over I have had a good experience with amazon and have no complaints
0974872407|5.0|Realmente impresionante. Muy pocos libros dedican tanto esfuerzo para desarrollar los personajes con tanta precisión. No hay personajes unidimensionales, todos son personas complejas, con sueños, aspiraciones y esperanzas. El telón de fondo, la Barcelona de postguerra, es perfecto para expresar la melancolía de la historia. Altamente recomendado, más que por el final (que es lo que más critica la gente), por el viaje a través de una de las mejores historias de misterio, amor, decepción y vida en general que se ha escrito.
B000001DYY|5.0|I read a review from 1999 where someone said this wasn't as good as a prior release, \\"Seeds of Love.\\"  It's 2010 now and in all of these years this has never ceased to be my favorite CD. It moves me every bit as much now as it did when it was released.  The reviewer also stated that this was Roland Orzabal's attempt to show that although the \\"Band\\" had broken up, everything was still the same.  That's not how I have experienced this recording for nearly twenty years. I think he was saying THIS is who I am.  He didn't throw Curt Smith out.  Curt Smith decided he didn't want to work as hard on the music as Roland did.  That was a personal choice for which Smith cannot be faulted, but it does tell us something about THIS recording.<br /><br />On Elemental the lyrics are woven into the music and with headphones that weren't readily available when this was released, or even cheap earbuds, I swear you hear something like 'power shots' of sound and intricate instrumental composition and overlay now.  I genuinely believe that as technology improves this artist will come to be more appreciated for the studio work that was done at the time of recording.<br /><br />I very much recommend this in any available format.
B003VS0CX8|2.0|I was waiting for years the Blu-ray release. Of course I preordered this item.  But what a disappointment! Sometimes picture is grainy, sometimes picture is out of focus, sometimes picture is not sharp. Ladies and Gentlemen this movie was made in the 60's not in the 20's. This movie deserves the better transfer possible in these days. The sound is pretty good, but I would like (and I hope I not alone) much much better instead DTS MA two channels stereo LPCM 192Khz/24bits to enjoy the full splendor of the music.   I already have 2 DVD releases and this Blu-ray release. For whom may concern I won't buy more.
B0042816YK|2.0|Let me preface this by mentioning I haven't read the book, though I've been meaning to, and after seeing the film first, I can only hope the book form is better. As a travel buff, I've been looking forward to watching this film, and I knew from the get-go that this would be a film about a woman's ennui and unfulfilled life. Yes, I know, first world problems--cue roll of the eyes. But I think many people can relate to the emptiness that pervades life on occasion.    That being said, even as someone sympathetic to this kind of plight, I found the character Liz to be utterly insufferable and a practically impossible woman to relate to. The film has Liz, lying in bed with her husband, looking bored and lonely. She gets out of the bed she shares with her husband to go downstairs to literally kneel down and ask for God's help for the first time, sobbing in the room of her multi-million dollar home. The problem with this entire premise is that her emptiness isn't presented in a way that is relatable to the audience. With film, the exercise is to convey what is inside by external means; the audience cannot magically divine what is going on with the characters. I understand what the INTENT was: her husband doesn't have the travel bug; her husband has ideas but doesn't stick to a single one to make it his passion; her husband doesn't share her curiosity of life, an inclination for what is MORE; she has it all but is still unsatisfied--there's no spark, no excitement. But for me these were not conveyed convincingly. Instead, we have Julia Roberts (playing Julia Roberts) crying, staring at the wall, yelling, acting like an overgrown brat with an alarming sense of entitlement. She purports to look within, but she doesn't. She turns her rage to those around her, and that's a fatal flaw in the film from which it never recovers.     The premise is very promising and intriguing: woman with all the trappings of life searches for more meaning in life by empowering herself--after all,it is often touted that money cannot buy happiness, and there are situations in real life where people who don't have much are happier than those with a lot (more money, more problems). Depression, for example, doesn't skip a person just because he or she is wealthy. Money and material goods are clearly not guaranteed keys to happiness and fulfillment. But instead of taking the opportunity to lay that foundation and build upon this premise, the filmmakers seem to skip it altogether in favor of pretty travel shots, apparently unable to take on the storytelling task. Is it difficult, especially in this economy, to make a film about the dissatisfaction and existential angst of a well-off woman? Yes. But it is not impossible, and if they are going to make a film based on this premise, they better well try to sway the audience. Unfortunately, they seem to just rely on Julia Roberts' \\"America's Sweetheart\\" status to replace effective narrative. The idea itself is interesting; the execution is the problem (most people can relate to the experience of seeing a fantastic trailer for a film or reading a film summary and getting excited, only to be disappointed after seeing the actual film).    In a meeting with the lawyers and her husband, Liz glares at her husband with the fire of a thousand suns, resenting him for being, well, him. Rightfully, her husband frustratingly informs her that she never sat him down to tell him what's wrong, never gave him a chance to try to fix it if she had such a problem in the marriage. The audience really only sees what ANNOYS her (e.g., he wants to do a postgraduate degree, he doesn't want to go to Aruba). Are these \\"flaws\\" big enough for her to just walk out one day? At least this warrants a serious sit-down talk about each of their goals and feelings, right? No. Liz doesn't feel connected to him, and instead of sitting down like adults, she decides to leave, cold turkey, because if you don't get what you want out of life, the lesson is you must drop all your problems and run. It is understandable for someone to want to end a marriage if she is unhappy, but to just cut it off abruptly without a serious discussion (and assuming abuse or infidelity haven't occurred, which, in this film, they haven't) is unreasonable and paints the person as a spoiled brat who never learned how to navigate life in an adult world. This is a bad start to a film...an unsympathetic protagonist. Oh, God, how many more minutes do we have to spend with this woman? Did she really just leave her husband because some medicine man in Bali six months before told her one of her marriages would be short? Really? How gullible are you, Liz? The filmmaker really missed out on capitalizing on one genuine moment in the film -- her husband, in the elevator after the meeting with the lawyers, looking truly broken by his wife's abrupt abandonment. Do we get to explore her need to do this in spite of her husband's deep love for her? No, we get Liz's three-second look at his broken figure before she decides to run abroad an cavort with strangers who are meant to fix all her problems.    Throughout the film, Liz makes no real decisions; rather, she allows others to do the thinking for her, which makes for tiresome viewing. The writing and direction are aimless and sloppy. Far too much of the film is spent on her romance with a struggling actor, David (James Franco), who is more of a caricature than someone along the road who truly enlightens Liz and helps her on her journey. He's young. He's handsome. He follows an Indian guru (shrine adorning his apartment), sounds like a fortune cookie, and is a complete poser. He states he has never been to India, but he wants to one day, and spends his day looking sexily forlorn, a tortured soul, when, in fact, he's just like those wannabe Goths who shop at Hot Topic (except he's the hippie version). One day, he wakes up to find half of his bed empty. Where's Liz? She has moved herself to the floor beside thebed, looking like someone just killed her puppy. Again, she doesn't talk about the problem. She just moved her bed to the floor like a petulant child because, again, as with her husband, she's unfulfilled and wants to break up for no discernible reason. Okay, maybe Prozac is in order?    We are meant to take away from this romance the idea that David inspired Liz's trip to India. After all, she never would have known about that guru if it weren't for this poser. Get it, audience? Each person she meets is like a clue to the next spot on the treasure map. Get it? Except the character of David is so hastily written and lazily portrayed that the impact of his influence is negligible (seriously, James Franco looked like he phoned-in his scenes, and even he admitted that he knows the film is terrible and that he only did this film to have the experience of working with Julia Roberts).    The Italy chapter of the film is the most enjoyable, simply because it plays like a fun travelogue -- food porn, fun people, pretty sights. Here, we get a little break from Liz's overbearing personality. We meet some other characters who welcome Liz with open arms, and there are beautiful shots of quaint cafes and restaurants, plates of delicious food, and beautiful cityscapes. For once, we get to see Liz just ENJOYING herself without lashing out, and for a moment the audience can forget Liz as Liz; she's just an American enjoying Italy like any tourist would, looking at Italy with new eyes.    I expected the film to escalate and become even more profound as we head to India, but the narrative takes a serious and boring dip here. You know all the foodcentric tie-ins in the promotion of this movie? It ends with Italy, and it is understandable, seeing that Italy is the \\"eat\\" of the triumvirate, but since the spirituality aspects of India and Bali are so clumsily portrayed that one cannot help but feel cheated by the rest of the film. Okay, if we can't have genuine spirituality, at least show how decadent the other places are. There's more to India and Bali than ashrams and huts. It's as if the writers and filmmaker didn't know what to do about India. \\"Hm, what's India known for? Gods! And poor people. Okay, this part of the film will be about Gods and poor people. It'll be like a spiritual thang.\\" So we have Liz living in an ashram, cleaning and doing practically nothing, and this is where she meets a Texan named Richard, played by the amazing Richard Jenkins, the highlight of the film. Though his character is paper-thin, Jenkins is so gifted and nuanced in his acting that he's able to flesh out a full character out of practically nothing. He's like your favorite uncle who wise-cracks and kicks you in the seat of your pants once in a while to set you straight. It is too bad that his character disappears rather quickly, which deflates the rest of the film. The writers try to flesh out India by introducing a 17-year-old girl forced into an arranged marriage (a heavy-handed parallel to Liz's own marriage, complete with flashbacks), but by then it is too late. Chapter 2 is already dead in the water. There's no spiritual enlightenment, just a disrespectful fast food approach to prayer and meditation. You just sit quietly, cross your legs, close your eyes, and spread your arms out. That's all, folks.     The film then skips abruptly to Bali, as if it did all it could do in India. Here we have the return of the toothless guru, who, like the Franco character, speaks like a fortune cookie and appears more like a stereotype more than anything else. Liz refers to him as \\"Yoda.\\" He's quirky, speaks with an accent, wears a sarong, and reads your palm...OF COURSE he's enlightened! He's from Bali! He's infused with magic! All the houses have no walls. It's really weird here! When the quirkiness of Bali runs thin, it's time to introduce Felipe (Javier Bardem), an affectionate grizzly bear of a man who kisses his son on the mouth and cries at the drop of a hat. He's not American! He's Brazilian! Passionate! That's what Liz needs! But after his profession of his love, Liz immediately pulls away and starts screaming at him, feeling suffocated. Really, Liz? It's his fault for falling in love and cramping your style? How dare he say it! He's supposed to be passionate -- but to a point, to some invisible marker that Liz draws in the air. Here, Liz comes off as bipolar, running hot and cold at the drop of a hat without rhyme or reason; she is angry at anyone who doesn't read your mind. At this point, the film suffers even more because it is unclear to the audience WHY he's in love with her. He professes to be madly in love with Liz, but it's a head-scratcher why because we do not see her as very lovable at all. She's a screeching banshee of a woman who doesn't seem to be aware of her own motivations, so the relationship itself seems forced, and, by this time in the film, it is too late to build this relationship up as The Relationship in the entire film (yet it is, to the detriment of the narrative; it wasted far too much time with David before introducing Felipe late in the game). She runs away, but one last minute trip to the all-knowing toothless guru, who tells her to open her heart, magically clicks in her head (despite people saying this throughout the film), and she runs back to Felipe and they live happily ever after. Instead of giving any of the foreign characters some real depth, the film paints them in broad stereotypical strokes.     The film never recovers from its biggest malaise: Liz is not sympathetic or relatable. We The Audience watch her cry, look empty, wander, and we can imagine what that's like from drawing on our own lives, but we do not FEEL for her because she isn't even active in her own life. Throughout the film, she is passive (funny, considering all the traveling she decides to do), but in every scene she doesn't seem to help herself, and feels like it is life's duty to provide others who will help her outof her slump. Liz begins the film financially comfortable, with an enviable job, a nice husband, a gorgeous home, and loving friends and family -- it will take some good strong storytelling to convince the audience why she feels unsatisfied. But the director and writers rely too much on the audience just being able to GET IT so the film can skip off to the three countries for the pretty shots. There is no compelling scene that shows Liz and her husband's true unfixable disconnect. We're just supposed to accept there is one from Liz's tears and blank stares at the wall and move on. There's nothing at all that convinces the audience that this gilded cage is suffocating; if anything, we understand Liz as a woman who just needs a good therapist and some volunteer work around the corner (but no, the film seems to say...you can't volunteer at home; you must have a profound experience with poor people abroad). The shot at the end of her ex-husband with a baby and new wife, strolling happily down the street, is meant to show the audience that Liz was right all along, that they were never meant to be, but it feels false and tacked-on instead of true vindication. The problem is, most people in the audience don't have the luxury of taking a year off to vacation in three countries to find themselves, so if you are going to make a film about an unfulfilled woman who CAN do all of this (and a film with merchandise tie-ins that include BUDDHIST prayer beads), it  would be nice for the filmmakers to make the point that happiness doesn't merely lie in stamps in your passport; rather, it's a journey you can take at home. You can meet wonderful people at your corner coffee shop and develop meaningful friendships. You can volunteer at a local shelter and find purpose. If you stopped enjoying food, you can find new recipes or cuisines to try. Unfortunately, the film clearly pushes the idea that for Liz, her existing family and friends aren't enough; she feels an ashram or guru (both stereotyped in the film) is the secret of finding herself; and she even proclaims that the food in her current area doesn't do it for her anymore. The whole film reads like a commercial for the travel industry more than an illuminating lesson of a woman at a crossroads in her life that each audience member can apply to his or her own life. If you want to make a film about a woman who is empowered by dropping it all to find more meaning out of life (and more power to her for doing that), great; it'd just be a lot more effective sans the cultural appropriation (the East is so mystical and weird!) and commercialization. For example,  take the $36 Eat Pray Love Lancome lip glosses, one of the many official merchandise tie-ins). It's kind of incongruent to market a film about materialism not buying happiness by selling lipglosses.     In short, the film is like one of those gimmicky Zen boxes you see by the registers at Borders: watered-down to non-existence and insulting.
B0013816GK|5.0|Definitely the best recording I have heard of this magnificent work. Perhaps the \\"Recordare\\" will convince you, to say nothing of the incredible performance of both the soloists. The performance of the orchestra really sets this recording apart, even from other versions under Guilini's baton.
B0023FFRQW|5.0|This 1964 Heritage Club Edition is a treasure!  The hardcover is appropriately decorated with motiffs of Casterbridge.  The wood engravings by Agnes Miller Parker are wonderful and unique!  Of course, the story reads like a tragedy - Henchard is certainly his own worst enemy.  On the other hand, Thomas Hardy's prose is certainly wonderful reading, unlike many 20th century so-called literary authors.  Hardy's descriptive analyses of places and characters are exquisite, including the historical aspect of the English countryside near Casterbridge. The secondary characters are varied, some solid and some weak in spirit.  Henchard seems to use them all to his detriment and the detriment of others.  Elizabeth-Jane and Farfrae give the story balance and in the end are winners despite Henchard's downward spiral.<br />This review is not in any way a descriptive review of the book's story line.  However, there are hopes that your interest has been peeked and that you will give this book a complete reading.  Also, there are DVD's of this story which can be accessed on Amazon.  This writer watched a DVD initially and then read the book.  After doing so I believe that reading the book first would be a better choice.

B0024RIMBG|5.0|The DVD as a live concert is superb !!!  The location where it's been filmed along with the entire performance, it's direction & production is nothing short of first rate !!  My only issue is the DVD itself, after 2 purchases & returns due to product defect, I do want a new replacement if a new one can be sent in good working order.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I watched this movie as part of a class. I read the book and didn't think this movie was going to be quite good since I've seen the Pride and Prejudice 2005 version. After watching about 30 minutes of it, I found myself drawn to this movie. It was awesome! I would have read the book faster if it had this plot. =D
B001C4Q7LO|3.0|These two albums are great by themselves, no need to contemplate on that. What I do want to point out are two things: First, you won't get a booklet in this package. Which in turn means no lyrics. Maybe not a big deal (you can understand most of the lyrics when you hear them), but it's not implied anywhere and it's certainly not welcome or expected. The second thing is that there in no song #13 on the Rabbit album, but its name is on the back cover. That's outright lying. If you can't bear with this packaging shortcomings, you're probably better off with ordering each album separately, since it's not much of a difference money-wise, and you'll be able to enjoy both albums as intended.
B002IW8V0E|5.0|I thought a movie with all ABBA songs What???  I own this movie and it's the most watched movie in my house. It is the best feel good movie since John Wayne in Mclintock. As a music major, Pierce was pretty good for a novice and trying to \\"show\\" emotion in his singing. Critics don't know crap. They must have had a blast making this movie. As far as the director she was just interested in making a good movie. Oh and did anyone know Tom Hanks helped produce this movie. Great movie!
B002ZG999U|3.0|Almost every action hero who can still deliver blank bullets and bad dialogue comes together in this orgy of insipid mayhem. I'm giving it three stars out of five in hopes that the scenes I slept through were better than the ones that put me to sleep.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|They did a good job with this movie.  Great actors and amazing fight scenes.  I only watched this because Russell Crowe was Robin Hood.  All of his movies are good so I thought this one would be, and it definately is.  If Robin Hood was played by someone I didn't know, I probably wouldn't have watched this, but it's done very well.  I recommend it if you like movies like Troy and stuff like that.  It's pretty similar to that.
0671449028|2.0|We've had this book since my daughter was very young. She was never very into it, but she absolutely loves other books.<br /><br />My husband and I also find it a little weird that they exercise after they put on their pajamas, but whatever....
0743454537|5.0|Anyone who says they didn't like the book either saw the movie first or just has no taste in good literature. You would never expect the ending and you will probably hate it but that is why I loved it. It is my favorite book ever but it is also the saddest. I'm not sure I will ever read another book that will make me cry as much as I did in this book. READ IT!!!!
0805047905|5.0|We've read this to our daughter over and over since she was just a newborn. Now she's over 18 months and she has never lost interest. She picks this book up, flips through the pages, and reads it to herself as she rocks in our reading chair. It is the sweetest thing I've ever seen and because of that this is my ultimate baby book!
B0042816YK|5.0|Couldn't tear my eyes away; this is Julia Roberts' finest hour. The movie stays true to the book; it's only the second film in all my years of reading that I felt stayed true to the book to the point where even the characters looked and sounded exactly as I had pictured them (the other one was Sophie's Choice). This is one I will add to my collection, and watch, again and again. Thank you!!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Always I've been fascinated with history.  This book was so interested and well written I felt like I could not wait for the next chapter. Once I got there I was compelled to read more.  The 6 main people in Barbara Demick's book just became a part of me.  There life stories and struggles.  Not even knowing what the outside world was like and then gradually learning that all they believed in was a lie.  This is very well written and expertly researched.<br /><br />If you enjoy history and knowing what really is going on behind the scenes, especially in light of recent news events out of North Korea, you'll want this one in your library.
B0048LPRCS|5.0|Ive seen a lot of movies, from different countries and different genres. I study film as well. Nothing ive ever seen compares to this. The movie starts off with one of the best intros imaginable. I thought the best intro was Takashi Miikes Dead or Alive in terms of intensity, but this takes the cake. After the insane intro, it brings u into the POV of the main character, Oscar. In these first 20 minutes (enjoy them because its the only time you'll be able to relax while viewing this film) you get to see how it feels like to be high, to make a drug deal, and to die. I want to place emphasis on the death part, because since this movie is in POV, you too feel as if you died. Its insane, and really scary so be prepared. The rest of the film is like one long bad acid trip that you want to be over, but you cant sober up so you just have to sit along for the ride. Thats the only way to describe what you'll experience. When you leave the theatre (or finish watching it at home) you will still feel the message of the film, because it was just that powerful. Its definetly not something you will want to see over and over again, even though its an amazing film. because of its intensity you'll probably only be able to handle it every couple months or even years at that. There were some cons though. For one, i couldve done without some of the long drawn out scenes where you pass through buildings and over walls. Also, i couldve done without the long drawn out 10 minute sex scenes at the end of the movie. Besides these little things that couldve been cut out, it nowhere near ruined the movie for me. Please do yourself a favor and see this movie, if only just once.if possible see it in a movie theatre instead of at home for the full experience.
B003Q6D29Q|5.0|Ever since I read Never Let me Go when it was first published, I've been haunted by the story. Whenever I think of questions about what I value in life, or advances in science (their benefits and potential dangers), or about the future of our world, this story comes to mind.     The director did an amazing job of bringing an emotional and introspective story to the screen, which is no easy task. Because this is my favorite book I was praying for years for it to be made into a movie and then praying that the director wouldn't screw it up! I'm so glad to say that he did an amazing job. I can't recommend the book or the movie highly enough.     P.S. Keira Knightley gives the performance of her career in this film.
B0043URV8M|5.0|I LOVE it!     The days of lightness at Hogwarts have gone. There is so little in Deathly Hallows that is fun and childlike. Our heroes are no longer the children we met so many years ago. They are alone in a world of darkness and evil.  The music expresses this so well. I have seen the film and have listened to the soundtrack everyday since. I loved the tunes that poured through the early films - classic John Williams but so often they are just a few notes short of ET.  \\"Harry in Winter\\", \\"Buckbeak's Flight\\", Neville's Waltz\\" and even Hooper's \\"The Friends\\" are rich and tuneful but they show no indication of the darkness and horrors that Harry, Ron and Hermione face in this latest epic.   There is too much pain, horror and evil in this film, It needs the menace and depth that Desplat has brought to the soundtrack; the rolling tympani, the deep bass notes. The three are pulled and ripped emotionally and physically - this doesn't lend itself to rippling frivolity. I can't imagine how John Williams would have scored \\"Captured and Tortured\\" with the evil and sadistic Bellatrix and Hermione's soul-rendering screams.    Listen to it a few times and appreciate a total change for the movie that has grown up.

B00001NTXN|5.0|Elegant execution of an elegant fundamental concept. Simple rules. Room for very deep strategy, yet fun strategic discoveries are accessible even at beginner levels. Beginners correctly feel they understand enough to make respectable moves and to create problems for the opponent. Surprising turns of advantage can occur.    Both players get 11 pieces: 1 pawn plus 10 fences. Each turn you move your pawn of place a fence. To win, get your pawn from the north edge to the south edge, while your opponent tries to get his pawn from south to north. You are not allowed to create an impenetrable complete chain of fences. Thus sometimes you place a fence to seal all but one remaining opening for your pawn, making it illegal for your opponent to block your pawn's path out -- which sometimes takes you unstoppably to your winning destination!    At times you can make a move that looks terrible for you to the eye yet is a winning move. What is visually happening on the board translates very well to an impression of the strategic effects of the moves, somewhat like Twixt.  Chess players will immediately recognize a loose analog of king opposition in chess endgames, and will feel similar issues surrounding immobility. Unlike chess or Khet, you never suffer a discouraging and probably permanent material deficit.  Playing Quoridor gives me a feeling that is a hybrid of what Twixt and Chess make me feel.    Khet is another great game I have yet encountered with this elegance and the other attributes at the same superb level as Twixt and Quoridor. Quoridor has fewer blunders than Khet (blunders in Khet feel much less forgivable than in chess, yet are more frequent in Khet than in chess). Quoridor is a Wow.    My wife knows nothing about games. Yet as a gift for me, my wife chose Quoridor over Quarto, even tho the games shop owner slightly recommended Quarto over Quoridor. She said Quoridor looked more like a board game with some animation to it.    My wife and daughter both immediatelywanted to play a second game. Excellent durations of approx 15-20 minutes. Pleasant to touch, made of wood, not plastic. Opportunities of clever moves. For 2 or 4 players (not 3, not \\"2-4\\" as the game box misleads).    At www .quoridor .net you can play against a computer in pseudo-3D, for free. Play against its strongest level.

B00005A8MA|4.0|Clapton fans may not be aware that he's on this, recorded during a year that represents one of his most creative periods. It sounds like the guys recorded the album all in one place, jamming. It was disappointing to find out that they weren't, but I suppose that given the time period and the calibre of the players, it was probably going to be impossible to get them all together.<br /><br />It's still an excellent LP. The music is superb, the subject matter of the songs is different to Mayall's usual gear, and the overall sound is set apart from his other LPs. I get his concerns about the 'muddinees' of the original recording but I'm not sure as to whether the rejigged songs are as good as the originals.<br /><br />Sometimes things are better left untouched..
B0002OERI0|5.0|To all you 350+ American Idiot 1 STAR ranters, make well in accepting change, because it's something that happens ALL THE TIME.    When American Idiot came out in 2004 it marked a drastic change in the style of \\"punk\\" rock that Green Day usually played.  Unfortunately \\"Punk\\" rock is a highly controversial style of rock that has led to countless arguments over what is and what is not \\"punk\\" rock.  Well, folks like anything else in this world, things change and things evolve.  It doesn't take a genius to know that The Ramones and The Sex Pistols sound no nothing like say Blink-182 or Green Day.  Green Day and Blink-182 are EVOLVED styles of \\"punk\\" rock. Just like Hard Rock.  Van Halen easily could be labeled a \\"Hard Rock\\" band.  But then again, so could Nickelback.  Does that mean they sound the same? No... Not by a long shot.  But they both fall under the same sub-category.      Green Day over the years has evolved as a band, just as any group does.  Much like an animal in the wild, a band will adapt to the changing times and styles to stay alive as a group.  In the process doing their best to maintain their own creative edge and style, while subjecting to the newly evolved style and sound.  Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do sometimes...  Some people call this \\"selling out\\"  I call it adaptation.      Like many of you hardcore Green Day fans I was less then impressed after hearing American Idiot.  It was a drastic change in style from the Green Day I listened to as a kid, but after long and careful listening I've come to realize it was for the better.  In no way does this sound anything like the Green Day from the era of Dookie or even Warning, but it's still Green Day.  One really has to take a step back and look at the big picture to see what Green Day has produced here.  This is anything but a straight forward rock record.  This album truly is a work of art.  This album is more than just some catchy songs the band hoped would spur a couple singles, this is a rock opera of epic proportions.      So bash all you want haters, this album is incredible.  It is a very rare thing for a band to hit it big, twice.  In 1994 they rocked the world with Dookie.  In 2004 they came back again to bless us with,..American Idiot.
B0040JHWKS|4.0|I'm a hugh Springsteen fan, yet I would differ with his opinion (given in the liner notes) that he should have released four albums instead of two during the span between \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" and \\"Born to Run\\"<br /><br />There MAY be a third album's worth of Bossworthy material here, but no more. For the most part, the songs DO seem like \\"second class citizens.\\"<br /><br />The most interesting songs are those that I've heard before:<br /><br />1) \\"Fire\\" (much better than either Robert Gordon's (too slick) or the Pointer Sisters' version (too \\"pop\\"), and my favorite track here; he gives us his Elvis impersonation, and an economicially funky guitar solo a la Steve Cropper; great bass line by Mr. Tallent, too)<br />2) \\"Talk To Me\\" (I've heard this on a \\"Springsteen Songs\\" collection, performed by Southside Johnny and the Asbury [D,J]ukes)<br />3) \\"Racing in the Street\\" (an alternate version of this great tune)<br />4) \\"Because the Night\\" (as good as Patti Smith's version, or close to it)<br />5) \\"Rendezvous\\" (an alternate version from the one on \\"Tracks\\")<br />6) \\"Come On (Let's Go Tonight)\\" which is the melody used in \\"Factory\\" but with different lyrics. It's very interesting, as the lyrics in \\"Factory\\" fit the mood of the song perfectly, but the lyrics here do not fit at all. It's no wonder he changed them.<br /><br />So there are four songs that could/should have been released way back when (\\"Fire\\", \\"Because the Night\\", \\"Rendezvous\\" and \\"Talk To Me\\") but the rest is primarily for Springsteen diehards.
0553808001|5.0|The Calendar is great!! Great art work of the castles in George R. R. Martin's A Song if Ice and Fire series of books.  The Artist is Ted Nasmith and he has done a fantastic job of painting his version of the beautiful castles in Westeros.<br />I got it at a good price and best of all it came quickly, no problems!<br />Looking forward to the HBO adaptation Game Of Thrones to air in the spring of 2011.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|I'm soooooooo glad I read a James Cameron interview on EW, talking about how in Nov he'd release the Complete 3 BluRay Disc.  With tons of extras! B/C of that article my waiting paid off. Didn't have to buy the same movie twice!
B003XSSR4W|3.0|Very dull and lifeless remastering. That's a tragedy for this great album. Listen for the hi-hat's or any depth of sound. Of course, the earlier CD release was a disaster with the mastering, so thankfully some improvement. This is an almost perfect album by Badfinger without a moment of boredom or anything out-of-place. It's Pete, Tom and Joey - they have a very unique distinctive vocal sound. I've read the easy cop-out by reviewers, \\"influenced by the Beatles,\\" and there a few similar Beatle riffs here and there, but people should be ecstatic that music this good was made, period. Pete Ham's songs are total classics. He is one fo the biggest losses in the music industry. What he could have done, if nurtured, is scary. Check out these new youtube videos of his band The Iveys. I knew he could play guitar, but he was ridiculous in many styles. He could have been in a blues band and made himself a name there, too. Joey Molland and Tom Evans contribute excellent material here, too. 'Suitcase\\" is a gem, and \\"It's Over' is mesmerizing. The bonus tracks are really fun, \\"Baby Please\\" is a hot rocker, but their remastering is particularly heinous. Darn, the sound should have been better. This album deserved it. You can hunt down the 90s DCC Gold disc of the album, or the remastered Perfection CD promo sampler, which has many tracks. Try EBAY. These two CD's show those Abbey Road Studios engineers could have done a much better job here.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|This is the best horror film I have seen since \\"The Shining.\\"    The relationship between Owen and Abby was beautiful and complex, and was masterfully done by the two young actors.  So masterful for their age I was immersed  immediately!   The story was superb and their chemistry was perfection.  The acting  by Richard Jenkins and  Elias Koteas was spot on and authentic, as could be expected and cannot be overlooked.        The cinematography and musical soundtrack were a perfect combination to create atmosphere and feeling.  The orchestral  music furthered the intensity and seriousness of  Abby's need to feed, and protect,  but the classic rock tunes from the era echoed the universal teenage experience of social  rebellion and  awkward sexual curiosity.  I was  personally  further drawn in because of being bullied at that same age, with no real friends to rely on.  The solitude and emotional pain are immense.  I could only dream then of having an mature minded  and loyal friend like Abby to help me through that tough time..     The strength that Abby provides, and ultimately uses to rid this problem for Owen is enormous and addictive. (much like this film!)   Thus it is easy to see why he would leave with her immediately at the end and forgo the average life.   I am addicted to this beautiful work.  Very few things inspire or move me anymore.  But this film captures a powerful moment in the human condition even with it's fictional elements.  Though a realist,  I am currently  in fantasia.  Though cynical,  I am currently inspired by greatness.  In a time when horror films pretty much suck,   It was a privilege to see this masterfully done work of art.

B003XTUZIM|5.0|To poster SYD who posted a one star review based on his total ignorance of DVD~Audio and the fact that ALL the KC 5.1 reissues also come with a Red Book Compact Disc (RBCD), as well. I have not received Islands and Wake, as yet, but the previous three Steve Wilson (of Porcupine Tree Fame) remixed editions (REDS, LIZARD & In THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING) are some of the most vital remixes imaginable.  You will hear sounds that were buried in the mix on regular vinyl and early CD remasters.  Steve Wilson remixed all these albums under Fripp's guidance and even Fripp who was NOT a big fan of Islands upon its initial release has now proclaimed Islands one of his favorites in the new 5.1 DVD~Audio edition!    Buy yourself a Universal Player (The OPPO BDP83 blu~ray is a fantastic choice), Syd, and you will be able to play SACD and DVD~Audio in multi~channel and since I collect both formats, you will be very happy with the amazing sound of DVD~Audio!
B0046IGOIO|2.0|Though I have 33 RPM records of the Doors from my youth, and have The Doors Greatest Hits on CD I anxiously ordered this CD solely because it listed that one of my two all-time favorite electric blues guitarists Albert King played with the Doors on four of the songs. I will now share with you in the actual general chronological order of my disappointments with this CD. First, upon opening the shipping package I was surprised to find a very underwhelming CD package. It was made of flimsy cardboard. The two CD's were simply slid into a section like for an old vinyl record on each side. On the back of the cardboard package where the songs were listed there weren't even any time lengths listed. Unlike most oldie releases (Such as the Jimi Hendrix Blues CD I bought last week.) there was no little booklet with the artists history regarding neither the groups life nor this performance. All that was provided was about three individual paragraphs. One by Densmore, one by Manzarek and one by Krieger.<br /><br />Now, I got to the sound quality. If the rating scale were to be chosen from the following five categories: 1-terrible, 2-mediocre, 3-good, 4-very good, 5-excellent, my rating without a doubt would be *2-mediocre*. Next the track selections. The opening track listed as \\"Start Of Show\\"... is five-minutes-4-seconds... of such an absolute waste of time... I can't believe anyone would even consider including that on a CD. There's silence... there's squeaking-hissing... why would anyone include that is beyond me. There are three other \\"tuning\\" tracks on the first CD, but thank goodness they're nowhere as long... though they're just as senseless. There are also two tracks entitled \\"Applause-Jim Talks\\" that I guarantee you... you won't be inviting over any friends to share these with.<br /><br />Since I take my reviews seriously, and after reading the prior two reviews I decided to do a test-comparison of the sound quality, because I really do rely on other people's reviews when I decide to buy a product I'm not entirely sure of. I have a pretty high quality stereo system which includes a turntable... even though I haven't played a record on it in over five years. I went and got my 1967 Doors 33 RPM record out and played it. The sound quality was better on that than on this CD. Especially the clarity of the voices. The whole reason I bought this CD was because of one of my electric blues idols Albert King. His classic string bending guitar sound was tinny, a mere light-light-shadow of any recording of his I ever heard... let alone have in my electric blues collection.<br /><br />The second CD in this \\"package\\" has six tracks. Two tracks are tuning... one is a short thirty-nine-second and forgettable \\"Petition The Lord With Prayer\\" statement... and one is \\"Thank You & Good Night\\". If they took off all the wasted useless sound checks and gibberish they could have put the two songs \\"Light My Fire\\" and \\"The End\\" on the first disc and possibly utilized the manufacturing costs they would have saved and included something helpful or entertaining instead.buy a product I'm not entirely sure of.

0553384775|1.0|This books fails in every way.  It was the worst book I have read in years.      For starters, the writing is not very good.  Mr. Belfort, like most of us, is not a great writer.  But where was the editor or ghost writer to raise the quality of the writing?    The story focuses much more on Belfort's sex and drugs rather than the business of Stratton Oakmont.  The stories are interesting at first, but hearing the same thing varied slightly multiple times in a book gets old fast.      Mr. Belfort claims to have seen the error of his ways, but in the book, he seems far more interested in bragging about this exploits, at work and as a partier, than expressing any regrets.  It is really disappointing for a guy who stole so much from so many to be bragging about it rather than expressing genuine remorse.  He also speaks about writing this as a form of redemption so his kids will understand him one day, but then presents their mother in an awful way, and gives details about her, that no child (even as an adult) would ever want revealed.      The book providers little insight into how firms like his really worked.  The details that separate the truly insidious nature of a criminal enterprise like Stratton Oakmont from the rest of Wall Street are glossed over.  Or Mr. Belfort attempts to convince his reader that all of Wall Street acts like this.  I am not naive, we all know there are transgressions at the big banks, but nothing like the goings on at Stratton (and to be clear, I am talking about the business side, not just the sex and drugs in the elevator stuff).       There are no business lessons to be learned from this book.  And the moral ones are so obvious you don't need to learn them here - if you steal from lots of people in a well documented way while acting like an obnoxious jerk, you will end up in jail with your family hating you.  So the only reason to read this is if you want to hear the wild stories, and while there are a few great ones, they get old fast.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I really, really liked Band Of Brothers so I bought this set with out hesitation and watched the whole thing in a weekend.  Well, I should of checked out the reviews first.  In my opinion it is pretty lame, nothing like B.O.B and for what I paid for it, it is a flat out rip-off.  Learn from my mistake and rent this one first!!!  You can always buy it later or buy mine for cheap!
0393072231|5.0|If you only have time to read one book on the financial crisis, Michael Lewis' \\"The big short\\" should be THE book. If you want to know how poor Dick Fuld felt when Lehman collapsed, read Andrew Ross Sorkin's book. If you are a policy wonk and want to know exactly which laws need to be changed/passed, read Simon Johnson's \\"13 bankers\\". \\"The big short\\" is as close to a Dan Brown/Robert Ludlum novel as you'll ever get on the financial crisis. You'll find yourself cheering for Steve Eisman and Michael Burry as they make hundreds of millions on the subprime market crash. Of course, you'll also never ever invest a penny in the stock market.
B0044LNR88|5.0|I just saw this epi again and I enjoyed it even more this go around.  I have to say one of the more special scenes was the end with Clark and Jonathan Kent.  It brought tears to my eyes to see how Clark, in his confusion and disappointment, leaned on his father as he had so many years before for guidance.  It was odd because I was transported back 10 years looking at Clark and \\"dad\\"...it was as if the years had not passed the way they slipped comfortably into their roles and Clark, despite knowing that he has matured these past 10 years, seemed to me to be that young man that started this series.  Yes he looks older but the look in his eyes as he looked at Jonathan reminded me of a young Clark.  It was an amazing achievement for Tom Welling to bring back this part of Clark to the screen. This is a special series with specail actors.  I am sad that this is their last year for the series.

0240816250|5.0|I've found \\"Way Beyond Monochrome 2e\\" to be informative, thought provoking, instructive and intimidating all at once. Certainly enough information to keep me busy interpreting, and applying, for some time to come. There's also enough theory, adequately explained, and, with sufficient pictorial example to satisfy and provide a good understanding of the \\"how\\" of monochrome photography. And the book truly does warrant five stars. However, and I'm almost reluctant to admit, I'm less than perfectly satiated. Not by a failure of the authors to provide more than what anyone would reasonably expect of such a quantitative volume, but, by the omission regarding the sense, or \\"feeling\\", that may be obtained and conveyed by virtue of monochrome which color fails to do. But then, isn't that asking too much.

1594489505|5.0|This book has its beauty along with all its tragedy.  It follows the lives of two women, Miriam, born illegimate to a mentally ill mother and a wealthy father.  Her mother was a servant in her fathers' home.  There is the beautiful Leila born long after her two brothers.  Her mother loved her sons, but her father loved his only daughter.

Her mother cursed her, cursed her father, but not when he was visiting, taunted the young girl about being a bastard.  Her father came to see her and really loved his daughter.  She stayed in a small house with her mother in a tiny village.  The city was very close but Miriam had never gone there.  Her father had three wives and many children.  One day she left her mothers' house and walked into the town.  She was fifteen years old.  She presented herself to her father's family, they wanted her very far away.  They managed to arrange a marriage to a man of forty-five, a cruel evil man who lived in far away Kabul.  Though Mariam's father loved her he did nothing to stop it.  Rasheed made a horrible husband.  Mariam became pregnant, miscarried and miscarried many times.  Rasheed became more hateful and beat her constantly because she couldn't give him a son.  She became a recluse and never went out in public.    Laila had a wonderful childhood.   Her father adored her, wanted her to be well educated and in charge of her life.  Be all that you can be he always told her.  Her best friend was Tariq a little boy about a year older.  When they became teenagers they find they feel more for each other.

But a rocket destroys her home, both parents are killed and Leila is left alone, hurt and disoriented.  She is taken in by Rasheed and Miriam who nurse her back to health.  Rasheed has ulterior motives.  Laila is alone and Rasheed wants sons.  He asks her to marry him.  Laila finds out she is pregnant with Tariqs' child so marries this horrible man in order to give her child a name and a roof over her head.  She passes off the baby as Rasheeds.  Rasheed tells Miriam she is to wait on Laila hand and foot, to be the young girls slave.  Leila is only fourteen.  Miriam is resentful of this and dislikes the girl.  But Laila marries him. what a mother must do for her child.  Then Laila has a daughter and puts herself on Rasheed's bad list.  He abuses her and beats her.  Then a son is born.  Rasheed is crazy about his son and the boy loves his father.  The two wives become close friends and the little girl and the two women become slaves to the males of the family.  Childless Mariam loves the little girl.  There are four years between the children.  Both women lose their looks due to starvation and constant beatings.  Both look much older than their actual ages.  And males dominate.      The book ends not longe after the bombing of the twin towers.  The book ends in  redemption and renewal.
055380684X|5.0|The Talent Code is a well-written mix of theory, science, and illustrative examples of how and why we learn.  I stubbled on an excert from this book a year or so ago (Clarissa's clarinet practice) while searching for something else entirely.  Since I've always been intrigued with the learning process, I added The Talent Code to my Amazon Wish List where is lingered for many months.  Now that I have finally bought it, I wish I had never waited!
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|I loved SATC for all the years it was on HBO. This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. From the first scene to the last it is a waste of time. I rarely see a movie that makes me angry while watching it, this one did it. I hope the SATC days are over now. If you want to laugh, watch a rerun, not this.
B00445JSWS|1.0|The shots are far away, blurry, obscured by the hands of the crowd and totally distorted.  Why couldn't the director just film the actual concert?  The close-ups are few and far between and Dave Gahan's typically energized performance isn't given much camera time.  The crowd gets more face time than Dave and Martin.  It's just attrocious.      The sound is not great and it wasn't Dave's best night vocally, but this would have been a great DVD if they had just filmed the band playing.  Simple as that.  Show the concert being performed not a bunch of \\"artistic\\" nonsense.      Don't waste your money on this.

B000YI7MRM|3.0|If you enjoyed the novels, the movie is enjoyable, but somewhat disappointing. By attempting to cover all of the novels in a single movie, there apparently wasn't time or budget to provide sufficient context.  If I hadn't read the novels beforehand, the movie wouldn't have made sense; since I had, it was amusing to determine from what novel each scene was pulled.  It is a shame that by not concentrating on a single novel at a time, it was apparently impossible to provide sufficient screen time to developing a fuller sense of that era.  However, while some events are taken out of sequence compared to the novels and others are combined, the differences between books and movie were not jarring.  The opening scene provided great atmosphere and I did enjoy the movie.  The casting was good - Viggo Mortensen is the ideal Alatriste as were the actors portraying Inigo.

B003Y8YXH6|2.0|John never wanted his voice up front and center. He always asked George and Geoff to mess it up, making it sound not like John Lennon. I remember reading that as soon as he discovered reverberation he sang nothing without the \\"echo in the cans.\\" I have bought and read more Beatles related books then I care to admit to my wife, and my humble opinion is that the voice you hear on the original album is \\"what John wanted\\" in 1980 and that's it.     The whole thing about Paul and Let it Be Naked is that this was what he intended his songs to sound like in 1968-70. He himself made the changes, not his wife after he died (oh, don't start that up. Ha.ha).    I personally have something against all this \\"cleaning up\\" of old work. For crying out loud; the Beatles recorded Sgt. Pepper to be a mono album. At that point they couldn't care less about stereo. :)
0452289963|5.0|This message is for all the negative reviewers of Eckhart's work:  It's easy to write off the concepts of his work on the level of mind, but the fact of the matter is that Eckhart is correct.  However, the ONLY way to understand the depths of his work is not to comprehend what he's teaching at the level of mind, but to BE his teachings.  I don't care if you think you understand how it all works.  If you truly did understand, you would not argue.  Ask yourself where all the hate and anger is coming from.  It's your hate and anger that is stopping you from making a life transformation.    Personally, I used to own Eckhart's \\"The Power of Now,\\" and I tried to read it many times but to no avail.  Something in my mind was blocking me, and I'd never make it past the first chapter.  After owning the book for 2 years, I had an experience commonly known as \\"kensho,\\" and 1 day later, I understood everything in the book.  I wish you all luck on your own journey.

0812550757|4.0|Another great concept, well executed by this master of scifi. I suppose it could be read as a stand-alone, but knowledge of the events that took place in the seminal \\"Ender's Game\\" will greatly enhance one's appreciation of all the layers of meaning in this novel. The character Ender is once again the protagonist, and he definitely brings with him all the baggage he accumulated in his previous role(s). It is hard to write a review of this book without giving too much away, since it is written as a mystery and the reader only finds things out as Ender manages to find them out. The twists and turns of the plot kept me guessing and the characters kept me reading.  A worthy successor to the Ender franchise.

1439102813|5.0|Unforgettable portrayal of living with Alzheimer's Disease. Obviously the author has an all-encompassing, clinical knowledge of Alzheimer's and uses it to delineate the journey of the protagonist and her family as the disease progresses. Yet that alone would not make this a novel I would recommend were it not so wonderfully well written. The entire novel is written from the perspective of the protagonist, the person who has Alzheimer's. When she forgets something or someone, we see the reaction of the people around her only through her eyes. We cringe as she tries to cover up her growing disability in front of work colleagues, but aren't privy to their private conversations about how to handle the inevitable dismissal of this once-brilliant academic from their ranks. We see her children cope with the disease and its implication for their own lives, but only through their interactions with her. We never really know what her husband is thinking as he loses his life's companion to this soul-erasing disease. Of course, we know all too well what this is doing to Alice and everyone around her, but like her, we are impotent to stop it from happening.  Everyone should read \\"Still Alice.\\"

I suspect a presentation such as this would have had a short life had it started on commercial TV. I would expect A&E or perhaps FX to pick this up for broadcast some time in the future.  I look fwd already to Season Three.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|This headset is extremely light, but VERY durable. It may seem flimsy, but in my opinion the light feel is actually a huge bonus because it prevents getting those stupid headaches after a long gaming session. I sometimes forget they're even on. In terms of function, this headset has very, very good sound quality, but note there is a little bit of static in the background. It helps A LOT when playing Call of Duty. I can hear people on the other side of walls etc., allotting me more time to prepare myself for their ambushes and what not.  I only have two complaints. The first is that the cups covering the ears are made of a mesh, which are very breathable and keep the ears from perspiring, but they can chafe just a little bit. This isn't a huge problem but it can take some getting used to (after a few times of using it I didn't even notice it.) The second complaint is that the volume adjustor box's dials are VERY sensitive. I sometimes bump the box and the volume of the game goes from being a nice level to something extremely high or low. It isn't a huge deal if you just place the box on your lap or farther from your body.    Overall I'd give this headset a 9/10. It's great and allows me to play late night games without waking up the rest of my family.   I hope this review helped.
1439163146|5.0|I recently saw 127 hours and was amazed at James Franco's acting range in his Oscar worthy performance. I knew Franco studied creative writing and was out with Palo Alto Stories. I was curious to see how his writing skills compared with his acting. I read the 1 star reviews as well as the rave reviews, so my expectation was cautious excitement. I was blown away by the stories. As with his acting, the stories have incredible range. I would be laughing out loud and then a few pages later I would be overwhelmed with a silent sadness. There's a palpable energy within the words. The adolescent perspective is present full force. As impressive as I am with the Palo Alto Stories, I know that James Franco is someone who is constantly learning & improving on his talent so I think we can expect even better works in the future. I hope he's started working on his next book. I look forward to both his books and movies.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|I LOVE this movie, always have! Used to watch it when I was a kid & now I'm hoping that my 2 year old son will love it as much as I did/do.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Other reviewers have stressed the importance of doing some background homework before seeing this movie.  That's because the film, while making sense to people who've seen the others and read the books, won't to those who haven't.  Even if you are a diehard Harry fan, you'll probably have your own opinions about what ought to have been included, and what wasn't.  You may feel that some characters deserved more screen time and more of a backstory. But you'll probably agree that the second-to-last movie in the \\"Harry\\" series does a more than competent job of adapting the (unwieldy plotwise) book.     If you're going in cold, you may wonder things like, \\"What the heck is Horcrux?\\"  \\"Why aren't the kids still in school?\\"  \\"Who are all these characters that only get a few minutes of screen time and disappear without any real explanation?\\" and so on.  Well, the kids have decided not to return to school after Headmaster Dumbledore's death in the last movie.  A Horcrux is a piece of soul, and Voldemort has figured out a way to split himself into seven different ones. Before the final showdown with Voldy, Harry must recover all these Horcruxes. That's why he goes on that camping trip with just his two pals.  Harry also has a telepathic connection with Voldy (again not explained) which allows him to be suddenly plunged into Voldy's memory.  That accounts for some of the odd flashbacks.    For most of the movie, Harry, Hermione and Ron are on their own, dodging the frequent magic hurled at them by Voldemort's crew, while searching for Horcruxes and trying to decipher why Dumbledore left them each a gift in his will. Most of the major characters from the previous films (who haven't died) pop in for an appearance including Alan Rickman as the nefarious Severus Snape; Imelda Stanton as former Hogwart's Headmistress who now holds a position in the Ministry of Magic; and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Harry's nemesis who has also been forced to grow up rather fast. Ralph Fiennes playsVoldemort capably as usual, but the villian who looks like she's having the most fun is Helena Bonham Carter, as Bellatrix.  (Sadly, there is no Neville, but I expect we'll see him in the next film.)    You could argue that so much of the movie is unrelentingly bleak, spends too much time on the Great Camping Trip, etc., but all these things can also be said of the book it's based on.  I, for one, felt a bit cheated at having to wait for yet another film, but to be fair, I don't see how the book would be better as a single film. So I'd recommend it anyway.
0739384198|4.0|The whole trilogy was great and I can't wait for January when the last movie comes out. So sad that Stieg Larson died too soon!
B002OSUUPQ|5.0|If you are serious about personal development, then this is an absolute must have for your library. The 4 Agreements can seem so basic but re-programming your mind is quite a bit more challenging. This audio cd allows you to form new habits by simply putting it in the cd player, listening, absorbing the information and begin to apply it to your life.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|A Christmas Carol with Jim Carrey is beautifully animated and has a great moral, even though it is not kid-friendly!  I love it!
B0042RUMEQ|2.0|Because I think \\"Did it on 'em\\" and \\"Romans revenge\\" are good, that's really about it. This is hip pop not hip hop. I'm really surprised Young Money approved this. But I'm sure it's really about the money at this point. Get kanye instead.
B004BSIJ9Q|1.0|I just threw up while listening to the first 2 tracks.    I realized the sound I made wretching sounded better than Kanye... and he has autotune!      He just keeps getting more self absorbed and can't sing.  He sounds like garbage.    And that is an insult to garbage.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|As usual the quality of production is outstanding; the audio and video is completely satisfying.<br /><br />The story continues as Andy gets ready to leave for college; the big question for the toys is what will happen to them. The development of this theme provides the story line for the movie.<br /><br />There are many adventures and misadventures as the future for Andy's toys is played out; new characters are introduced along with some seriously threatening situations for the toys. The drama of some of these threats can produce concern for some children; this has a number of sections that place the toys in great peril.<br /><br />The intensity of these threats may be upsetting to some children; it may be well to rent this one before you buy if your main audience is children.<br /><br />From a collectors viewpoint, this is a must have film; this appears to wrap up this phase of the toys lives leaving the toys in a peaceful, happy situation. So the end does bring resolution for the toys but only after some fairly big time adventures.<br /><br />I'm delighted to have it as an addition to my collection!
B001GKJ2DY|1.0|If you loved this play, you will truly be disappointed in the quality of the acting and singing in this movie.  It was laughable at times.  Very Hard to watch and painful to see Pierce Brosnon singing.  It just does not work for a movie.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|The DVDs came in a timely manner and were in great shape, which was perfect because we were so excited to get them!
B003EV6DBM|1.0|Terrible, terrible, terrible.  Matt Smith is a lightweight and his new companion is a joke.  How could you possibly follow the brilliant David Tennant and his amazing sidekicks with Matt Smith and Karen Gillan?  It seems that, by trying to make the show younger and hipper, they have killed it.  All of my Doctor Who-loving friends don't want to watch it anymore.  Bad choice for a new direction.  Steve Moffat had a chance to really keep the series going in a positive direction, but instead he killed it.
B001NLKT60|2.0|This was my first review and my first reading this series. My sister bought it for my birthday and insisted I would be entranced. I have been slogging through endless meanderings about all sorts of strange back stories since. Each time I pick up the read, I tell myself that interest must be just around the corner. Why else all of the hoopla? After all of the time spent reading, she was just attacked, and I didn't care. I am putting this book down and may never pick it back up.<br />The reason for the two stars is that there are some engaging passages. There is just way to much chaff for the wheat reward.
B003WTE886|5.0|Taylor Swift showed her true colors on this album. Every song is unique and is from her heart. I can't get enough Taylor!!!!!!
B0041T7FS6|5.0|If you are or was a fan of the disco genre, then this is a must have, especially for Chic fans. I like the fact that it contains some of Norma Jean Wright's hard to find classics on here. It's worth the buy just for that alone especially since the record labels have yet to release her solo album on cd. Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards produced some heavy funky grooves back in the day. Not only for themselves, but for other great artist. Even though I have pretty much all of Chic's material, I'm still copping this box set. I'm just a fan of these guys.  Period!
0812550757|4.0|Three thousand years ago, Ender Wiggin completely destroyed the alien race known as the Buggers.  Ender disappeared after and was reviled for this xenocide: the total destruction of the only other known race of sentient beings known in the galaxy.  A powerful voice - the Speaker for the Dead - came to be heard: telling the true story of the Bugger War.<br />A new race of beings was discovered on the recently settled planet of Lusitania. This discovery, of a race the humans called the Pequininos, (also known as `the Piggies') was seen as an opportunity to atone for the destruction of the Buggers.  And thus, to avoid any tragic misunderstandings that might lead to war, strict rules have been put in place to prevent the human colonists from influencing the evolution of the piggies.  Only trained xenobiologists are permitted to interact with the Piggies, and contact is limited.<br /><br />`The piggies were not to be disturbed.'<br /><br />Over time, two xenobiolologists are killed by the Piggies in what appears to be a bizarre fashion.  One consequence of each death is that a Speaker for the Dead is called for a different member of the colony.  A Speaker is summoned, and travels to Lusitania.  In order to speak for the dead, he also has to understand the living and this includes both the Piggies and the human colonists.<br /><br />It happens that the Speaker who responds to the request is the original Speaker for the Dead, Ender Wiggin himself, and he has another mission as well.<br /><br />`On his starship, Ender Wiggin had no notion of the freight of other people's dreams he carried with him.'<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel to `Ender's Game', and am looking forward to reading the third novel in this series.  This book could be read and enjoyed on its own, but I'd strongly recommend reading the series in order.  Orson Scott Card has created a fierce, complex world occupied by beings with a mixture of historical, contemporary and likely future problems.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B003WTE886|5.0|Love this CD!  Shipping was fast...I received it at my house on the same day it was released to the public so that was really great.  I would highly recommend purchasing this CD from this company.
B001DJLCPO|5.0|I wasn't sure what to say about Mirrormask until I had seen it a 2nd time, several months after I bought it. But now it is very clearly a work of visionary power. That power is seen thru the limits of a $3 million dollar budget, yet its the non-essentials that get filtered out. Its disconcerting on first viewing because we're used to the non-essentials. This is a rarity in modern times - A truly lean, well-made film.<br /><br />If you've heard the criticisms of the plot or pacing, let me just say plot and pacing come thru as vividly as the visuals. Ditto for the musical score. And I think those criticisms are rooted in the fact this movie is suitable for kids. Think of it as a litmus test: How long can critics stay interested in something that has no violence and no sex? For myself, the characters are marvelous, and its hard to understand why we don't see these actresses and actors in more roles.<br /><br />This is also one of those movies where the Making-Of doubles the value of the movie. Even having worked on the movie, people grasp for words to describe it. Commercialism is easy to describe. Creativity is hard to describe. What do you say when a world springs from someone's mind? Care to step inside?<br /><br />Ultimately, I have to state the measure of Mirrormask's originality: Its like nothing I've ever seen or heard.
B00406UK7S|1.0|In yet another attempt to make a ridiculous, bony, super-model ninja chick convincing, we see yet another attempt crash and burn.  Please do what both history and the fans of this type of film want...either get tougher women(I mean, seriously...Leyla Ali or somebody), or do the realistic thing and have the men fight men, as both history and reality dictate.  The reason the ROME tv series was so great was the realistic treatment of history...it made the action more relevant...thus more interesting.<br /><br />There is a reason this film was ignored, and it wasn't the script or the direction.  To see a group of history's most successful fighting forces decimated by a skinny chick is silly.<br /><br />What a waste.
1603425381|5.0|This is a must-have for every crocheter's collection. It is the sort of compendium of inspiration,  ideas, techniques and information, that one wishes  every and any how-to book would be. I loved the format, finding it clear and  portable. My only unmet desire is an organizational structure that led me from one thing to another: for instance the index has 7 different locations for puff stitch designs. Why aren't all the edgings with puff, popcorn or scallop stitches together? And why not names for these compelling designs as well as numbers?   The feast table is piled high, here.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|Okay, I admit it.  I'm 63, and I barely paid the Eurythmics any interest.  But Annie Lennox has created with A CHRISTMAS CORNUCOPIA exactly what her title states: a bounty of hauntingly beautiful carols many of us too once sang in  church children's choirs but also hopeful melodies for a future which can and should be better than the past. Isn't that the essence of Christmas--memories of a baby born to save us blended with reminders of babies born for us to save? What a melodic tribute to the human condition Annie Lennox has given to those lucky enough to listen.
031603438X|5.0|You start out thinking \\"this should be good\\" and before you know it, you're hooked.  Really engaging read, and made me remember why I loved the Stones growing up and why 70's heroic-chic Keef was my solid crush for years.  I admit, I glossed over a few pages here and there....he drops a lot of names in this book, and I wasn't necessarily interested in those other folks, though clearly, Keith care about his musical associations and is always quick to credit his predecessors and colleagues for their contribution to his music.  But it's the kind of book where you can go back and read sections (a handy index in the back really helps), so I'm sure I'll go back to those odd pages.   It's not a celebrity tell-all, though there's that element, and it's not just drug stories, though they are clearly a part of it.  He discovered music at a young age, picked up a real live guitar (not some wanna-be \\"guitar hero\\" input device) and fell in love.  Thanks for all you've given us, Keith.  Hope you're not going anywhere anytime soon.  Love ya!
B004132I20|5.0|Pitch-perfect performances and brilliant, complex storytelling that requires a second viewing to really appreciate.  I've watched and enjoyed the series online many times, but its cinematic feel calls for the Blu-ray.
B0041T52S6|2.0|Like others, I expected a lot more from this movie.  Based on the previews and description, I believed it would be a great, funny movie.  I was disappointed.  I found it to be childish and, well, stupid.  This is one of the rare purchases that I feel was a true waste of money.  If you want to see this movie, I suggest you rent it, that way you will have only lost maybe $5, rather than $20.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|I recieved this cd on the date it was released as promised and also received kanye west cd, and immediately didnt like it, only track i liked were her singles shes already released,\\"Right thru me\\" \\"your love\\" , after highly  considering sending it back immediatley i gave it to my friend for ten dollars hahahah!!! never again sorry nicki, but the cd was not enough for me...kanye cd get 10 stars out of 5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I was lucky enough to see HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 with three generations of Harry Potter fans:  my mother, my sister, and my 18 year old nephew (who shall remain nameless since he deigned to be seen in public with three older women in his family!).  All four of us really, really enjoyed the film, and we had a great time discussing it afterwards.  All of us agreed that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the best adaptation, truest to the novel, in quite sometime.<br /><br />HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the first part of the final Harry Potter novel of the same name.  The Death Eaters are taking over, and Volemort is back in power.  The wizarding world is still reeling from the death of Dumbledore, and Harry Potter is essentially public enemy number one.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione are on the run and looking the remaining horcruxes.  If Harry can destroy all the remaining horcuxes, he will finally have a chance of destroying Voldemort for good.<br /><br />My nephew stated that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the best screen play adaptation of a Harry Potter novel to date, and the rest of my family agrees.  While none of us believe that you can go into this movie cold, without having read the books or seen the previous 6 films, we all agree that if you are a fan, you will love this movie.  This book was one of my favorites of the series, and the film version is right up there for me, too. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint continue to delight us as Harry, Hermione, Ron.  These actors perfectly portray these three beloved and endearing characters, and I, for one, can't imagine Harry, Hermione, and Ron any other way.  These kids have grown up on the screen, their talent developed and matured, and I have enjoyed their journey.  Rupert Grint is especially notable in his jelous, horcrux-induced rage, and the \\"dream scene\\" between Harry and Hermione is well done, and quite uncomfortable (as it should be).  Some of the scenery is stunning, as well as quite atmospheric.  The long shots of the deep woods and empty plains expertly conveyed a true sense of cold, longing, defeat, and loneliness.  The emotions of this film run high, as friends are injured and some die.  And of course, there is a cliff hanger ending, since this is only the first half of the final book.<br /><br />HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 does exactly what it needs to do:  whets our appetites for the final installments  I know I can't wait until July.  The final movie promises to be the best yet.<br /><br />Side note:  As we were driving to see HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1, it occured to me that my nephew was about 9 years old when the first film openned, and now he is 18 and driving US to this film.  He and a whole generation of kids really have grown up with the Harry Potter books and movies.  It is wonderful to see that even after all this time, Harry Potter still captures the hearts and imaginations of millions of children of ALL ages.of the scenery is stunning, as well as quite atmospheric.

B004498KPU|3.0|This DVD set is really a fantastic collection of some great work by the late and great Michael Jackson. The reason I rate this 3 stars is because, On the box it clearly says \\"ALL 35 SHORT FILMS IN FULL\\".  Lie.  \\"Smooth Criminal\\" Is the 10 minute version. Smooth Criminal in it's full version is more around 30,or 35 minutes.  \\"Ghost\\" Was always my favorite short film! I think it was a wonderful amazing peice of work. However the DVD gives us a edited 4 minute version of the film. Originaly 35 minutes. Ghost was never released on DVD so when I read that this had Ghost in its full I WAS SOO EXCITED, I got home clicked play and it wasnt. Guys and gals, dont be fooled as I was. If you dont care about those 2 wonderful videos then this set is super fantastic. Just to let you no, dont buy it for Ghost like I did.
0312370849|4.0|\\"Sarah's Key\\" is a wonderful novel of fiction.  The problem is just that, a book of fiction.  It was set in the real Holocaust world with real places and events, but disappointedly,a too romantic story to parallel with the horrific facts of the Holocaust.  There are so many nonfictional novels dealing with real stories of heroism and survival.
B0027BJC7M|5.0|The Road Less Traveled on CD changed my life 20 years ago.   I had gone through a divorce and came across this set of Audio Cassettes at the time. From the first word to the last I felt Dr. Peck (who narrates) take me down a road of life that I had not traveled before. I hung on every word and at the end I understood life as I never could have seen it without his guidance. I went back to college and became a Family Counselor, volunteered at crisis centers, and started a National Hotline for Children and Couples going through divorce.   I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Peck at a book signing a couple of years ago and thanked him for changing my life. He was very interested in my National Hotline for Children. He is even more remarkable in person. I bought the tapes again for my daughter who is now going through a divorce herself and asked me what to do. I handed her this 25th Anniversary Edition and told her \\"It's all in here. All you need to do is listen.\\" She has now re-enrolled in college and has ambitions beyond what she ever thought she could have achieved. She is independant, motivated, disciplined and happy again.   FYI- This is the largest selling book in the world: in 26 languages and 92 countries
B003QNXPUK|3.0|The product is very good but not really very easy to place on the phone.<br />The film is very strong.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Though 'The Passion of the Christ' is not an easy film to watch, I would still rate it as one of my top films of all times. This is an eye-opener, one of the most realistic portrayals to the life of Christ. Though very violent, this is what really happened (if not exactly like the actual event, at least close to it), and therefore something we must be aware of, rather than having the facts sugar-coated.<br /><br />Additionally, Gibson put in greater depths to Christ's suffering by having flashbacks to Palm Sunday as well as his childhood, and this just made me weep all the more. If you haven't seen the movie, you must watch it to see how these events fit into the context of the last 12 hours.<br /><br />A haunting and powerful film, it made me weep up to the very end. I recently saw this again at a church viewing, and the entire church hall was filled with sniffing and weeping. Some people were even prepared with a huge box of tissues. It's a movie that has stayed with me for the rest of my life.

0061997811|5.0|This book is an everlasting reminder of how the Harry Potter Franchise evolved and magnified in the eyes of the public especially to Harry Potter Fans and will be fans in the next generation.
160094048X|5.0|I love this book. The recipes are easy. The ingredients are easy to find. The oameal cookies that I made when I first received the book, where great. My 15 year old daughter loved them, and they did not call for a lot of sugar. She said the raisens made them sweet enough. I also added nuts.
0307269752|1.0|I liked this book so much that I threw it away.<br />I thought about taking it back to the store where I had bought it, but that would be allowing a villanous capitolist to profit again from another fool like me who ends up buying it.
0812550706|5.0|great book with a similar appeal as \\"The Hunger Games\\" series, which was also excellent.  made me buy the rest of the series.  hard to believe the book was written 25 years ago, as it is still spot-on futuristic.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|The music to the movie is just as haunting as the film itself. Though all the tracks are good, my favourite is the first one \\"The Olive Garden / Night Sky.\\" There is something so poignant about it; it tugs at my heart strings and brings tears to my eyes. But the vocals and woodwings in the other tracks are also very powerful.<br /><br />'The Passion' apparently has two other CDs, which I also have - songs by contemporary artists - but for me, the soundtrack is still the best to have. It's just beautiful.
B004132I4S|5.0|Definitely my favorite album of 2010 thus far and probably my favorite album of the past few years.    I don't think an album has ever moved from being extremely catchy and danceable even to bringing me to tears like this.  I don't really want to say much more because I don't want to spoil it.  All I can do is tell you to give it a listen.
015206396X|4.0|I loved this book! I truly didn't want it to end. I'd love to write more, but busy, busy, busy. Oh, and I loved the narration. Some of the music in the background was a little too much, but I loved having different voices for the characters.
1593272200|5.0|I don't have much to add to Vladimir Ivanovic's review, except to echo that this is an outstanding book in the style of Stevens' (and Rago's) beloved classic Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment.  I am now recommending it to my friends and colleagues over Stevens.  Covers the same territory as Stevens and more, since it contains the entire Linux system call interface.  The treatment of each system call is very thorough, indicating deviations from the Single UNIX Specification and comparisons with various Unix flavors.    This is not a \\"how to program\\" book, but you will definitely learn a lot about programming from it.  I would recommend it to anyone who is serious about Linux/Unix programming in C, or actually in any language.
0679745203|5.0|Have not read the book yet, it is waiting on a tall stack of still-to-be-read books, but I must compliment the bookstore on the beautiful condition the book arrived in
B004AQR29C|2.0|The main problem was that I saw Rambo with all that gore and carnage.  The use of knives and the auto shotgun was great in this movie but Stallone really mellowed it out.  Both movies involves mercenaries, explosives, foreign dictators with a small army, a daring escape and rescue, a hottie, but Rambo just does it better.    Their individual movies were better.  Dolph Lundgren in the Punisher, Statham in Death Race, Jet Li in Kiss of the Dragon, etc.
0743277457|5.0|I cannot recommend this book enough.  Beautifully written, Josh has achieved a great deal and performed at very high levels yet with much humility he has clearly broken down fundamental principles of his success.    95% of all other advice books, life coaching are simply rags to riches stories with little abstract feel good gimmicks which never detail process or experience fully for you to internalize their techniques.    Josh delivers great examples and metaphors for principles such as Building your Trigger, Beginner's Mind, Investing in Loss and using Recovery Periods.  From reading this book it is clear to see that has experience in teaching and coaching young and old talent alike, how to develop and encourage their natural abilities with sound fundamentals.      He is a true inspiration for hard work, self awareness and clear action.    At age 25, I'm traveling the world after a personal little crisis very Kerouac like, I know... how original.  I've achieved a lot so far physically and intellectually and found much truth in his observations in the differences between the successful and the not so.  In my current moment of introspection I must have read more than 60 or 70 books in philosophy, psychology, self help and modern biographies.  I can proudly say that there are only 1 or 2 genuinely original books which the rest have simply been emulated.  Think and Grow Rich being one. I would place The Art of Learning in the top 5 without a doubt.    One area I would have liked to see included would be 2 or 3 pages discussing how to he worked to manage his ego and how he saw other competitors nurture theirs, I can imagine young chess masters being well acquainted with the dangers of egomaniac self images, such questions on how to maintain a grip of reality ? the balance between ambition and current technical ability ? the difference between self delusion and genius ?
0545123275|4.0|Overall I really enjoyed this book, but I will admit, I'm a little tired of the werewolf/teen love saga.  That's not to say I can't wait to pick up Linger and see how the story continues.
B002ZG99CC|3.0|This is a nice action film. It is well choreographed so as to make the fight scenes believable. However, the story line is one that has permeated kung fu films for decades. And that is, the star starts out at the bottom rung and gets beaten up over and over until one day, he is taken under the wing of an obscure but fantastic trainer.<br /><br />Over a period of time, in this case 'the kid' develops into the best fighter around and eventually has his day at revenge.<br /><br />With that being said, enjoy the scenery of China, and enjoy the action, but the plot is razor thin and has been used more than a dozen times already.
B003PIUBZS|4.0|If you are a typical guy and all you came to expect was blood and breasts, than you certainly have come to the right dvd. But shockingly, there is much more to this series than just a guilty pleasure. When I saw the first episode I was incredibly disappointed. It seemed like 100% exploitation with low budget film sets overkilled CGI blood. I had every right to write this off as a made-for-tv mini series  to cash in on popular high budget films like gladiator. But as the series progressed, it got much better each episode. All of the characters grew and evolved fantastically . The quality of the dialogue and scripts became much more evident. And the season finale is one of the most epic of all time. Do yourself a favor and don't write this series off after one episode.
030726999X|5.0|Much as the tv series \\"Law and Order\\" first centers around the crime and the violence and then moves into the realm of the legal and the strategic, thus has the Larsson series progressed and matured.  I found Hornets' Nest the most intriguing of all of the books; I was captivated from the very beginning.  And there were enough twists and turns to keep the edge up.  And, of course, Karl Faste always remains lurking as a threat throughout the book.
B003YOZNBU|4.0|I'll have to admit that I really enjoyed the movie. It's not something that will appeal to everyone but it is a fun movie to watch. The only real complaint I have is that it was too short. I mean 70 minutes? Come on! That is terrible! It didn't really have time to develop the characters the way they should have been. The movie needed at least another 30 minutes. Other than that the movie was fine to me. Yeah, some of the guns were a little out there (like the gatling guns on the saddle and the dual cross bows that shot dynamite) but that is not enough to say the movie is horrible like some reviews I've read. It doesn't go with the comic at all and I kinda hated that at first but after a while I got over it. I watch movies to be entertained and this movie was entertaining to me.

B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie is anything but your ordinary Friday night movie your typical teenager. Expect....    - Thoughtfully written and witty dialogue rather than overly vulgar and crude language/innuendo.     - No sex scenes (yes, there is an intimate bedroom scene, but you'll see what happens and laugh)    - Coke zero being promoted over alcohol     This is such a great and honest film which is completely devoid of modern hollywood cinema exploitation. High brow audience will certainly give a nod of approval to this film as it really takes teen action/comedy genre to another level. The director did a fantastic job turning the highschool musical fad over it's head. Rather than breaking into song, the movie has 7 sequences that break into amazing and dazzling fighting scenes.     This movie may appear geared toward the geeky/hipster crowd, but it's done with such style and great direction that anyone who doesn't \\"get it\\" can still appreciate it. I myself am a bit too old to pick on all of the nintendo references, but that's not the point of the film. The story of an obsessed 22 year old willing to fight 7 evil ex's in order to continue dating the girl of his dreams is probably the most original concept for a film I have heard of, and pulled off even better.     The beginning half hour of the film focuses on the protagonists unrequited affection for the girl of his dreams. This part of the film feel's much more like a cute and geeky romantic comedy than a fast paced action film. But then the second act really picks up the pace with the blockbuster special effects and fighting sequences which includes great breaks of backstory and dialogue in between each fighting scenes. Many may find the first half a bit of a bore and the comedy may seem too dry for many's taste, but stick with it, this film is always picking itself up and never falls flat! I'd even recommend this as a family  movie for parents with older high school or middle school aged children as typical teen toilet humor takes a backseat to the artistic vision of the film maker.
B00127RAJY|3.0|The video is o.k. If it did not get jammed at certain parts it would be better. That has nothing to do with the content, just the quality of the disk.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|Forbidden Planet is the groundbreaking science fiction film of the '50's. It's not just a \\"bug-eyed\\" monster is trying to get us flick that popularized the drive-ins of the day but a well thought out intelligent story with a poignent theme. Many have compared it to Shakespeare's, The Tempest. It may also have been one of the sources for the iconic Star Trek series. I consider it number one of all sci-fi films of the 1950's, with The Day the Earth Stood Still as number two, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers number three.
B0044LK8J4|5.0|As someone of Ukrainian-heritage, I was intrigued by this CD featuring a famous Ukrainian carol, Schedryk, which tends to always be performed as \\"Carol of the Bells\\" in English. Since it is rare to see it included under its original title, I purchased a dozen of these CDs to give away as gifts. Already a huge Pink Martini fan, I knew it would be terrific. Needless to say, I was thrilled when I heard them mastering Schedryk in Ukrainian (wow!!), but the entire CD is outstanding! You will be hard-pressed to find any other recording ensemble with such a versatile range - singing in a number of different languages and hitting all musical styles. Hats off to this gifted group of artists!! Hand these out instead of the usual chocolates and wine and your friends will be forever grateful. Joy to the World indeed!
0061777250|5.0|A very fine treatise from a respected cardiologist; whom offers insights, anecdotes, critical analysis and opinion on the ubiquitous phenomenon known as the Near Death Experience or \\"NDE\\" for short.  This work has a great deal of breadth and a more than sufficient amount of detail to thoroughly, although not exhaustively, examine this intriguing, if not beguiling, existential conundrum.  Dr. Van Lommel has produced a well written, edited and sagacious book that offers compelling evidence for the near certainty that consciousness is in fact: non-local, ever present and timeless (owing to the implied conditions of non-local space.)  In a very superficial manner, this piece could (and will) be labeled as being somewhat ad hoc.  \\"Superficial\\" is the operative word in the preceding sentence.  As Van Lommel is keen to point out in his book, 97% of the governing body of scientists - i.e., those that oversee the dispersal of research grants, review scientific papers etc. - are of the materialist/reductionist variety.  Therefore, it is a foregone conclusion that much more research needs to be done in this venue of cutting edge science.  In a certain respect \\"ad hoc\\" science is the best science as it is not afraid of posing intricate and delicate questions nor offering what may be considered fanciful answers; \\"ad hoc\\" in my humble opinion, is synonymous with open-minded, unbiased and employs what should be the motto of any good scientist, that being: \\"what if?\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, I highly recommend this book as it is informative, practical and exceptionally well thought-out and presented.  Good stuff!!  5 stars with ease.

0790729628|5.0|When discussing the works of Ripley Scott, it is extremely difficult at best not to use such cerebrally intimidating terms such as \\"eclectic\\", \\"noir\\", and \\"dazzling technology\\". As such, this review will attempt to keep such terms to a minimum.   In 1979 Ridley Scotts second film that he ever made, \\"Alien\\", was a smash hit. (His first film ever was \\"The Duelist\\" in 1977, in case you were wondering). The movie Alien was hailed as a masterpiece in which he mixed visceral horror with science fiction. Its no surprise then, that Scott's third movie, he mixed film noir and science fiction in much the same way to make the technically astonishing movie \\"Blade Runner\\" based on the 1968 classic by Phillip Dick called \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\". Although it did not do well at the box office, is another stroke of genius. As the movie starts off, there is a virtual tour of futuristic Los Angeles. The movie watcher is made to feel as if they have awoken from a cryonic chamber and are observing the changes that have taken place.: The weather and environmental color is drab, there are gigantic animated billboards offering goods and services(something that didn't exist in 1982 but already exists now), and  that Coke is still around. Even though the scenes were constructed using 1982 technology, they are still breathless and when viewed on a flat screen TV are close to three dimensional. Next is the introduction to the melancholic Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) who in contrast of the Replicants that he chases, appears to take life for granted. The philosophical themes in this picture are endless. One popular philosophy is that Deckard himself is a Replicant this theory is doubtful as Replicants appear to be superior in strength and maybe even intelligence to humans. Deckard is only able to bring Replicants down to retirement by relying on the one edge that humans have over Replicants: experience. Since Replicants can only live for four years, they do not have as much experience at anything as their human counterparts.   In addition to the movies in depth philosophy, Blade Runner makes several realistic predictions: (1) Los Angeles/California is predicted as being culturally isolated and diverse to the point of mayhem. This forecast is even more probable today, than it was in 1982. California and especially Los Angeles has already become extremely diverse culturally. Caucasians no longer represent the majority of the population. Additionally, each ethnic group tends to isolate from the other ethnic groups. There is Chinatown, Korea Town, Olvera Street, and Watts. Each neighborhood has its own cultures and languages that are not only spoken, but seen on Billboards and even street signs. Select cultures are even pandered to by the government. Even though it is currently the law to be a US Citizen to vote and to have a driver's license, and even though it is a requirement to read English to become a US citizen, Drivers License exams and ballots are written in Spanish and many of the Asian languages. There is no need or incentive for an immigrant to assimilate into one uniform society. (2) Technology continues to advance at a prolific rate. From 1982 to 2010, technology has grown tremendously. No one in 1982 would have dreamed of DVDs, flat screen TVs, GPS  systems, iPods, or cell phones that do just about everything would be in wide use in 2010. Flying cars may not be far off. It would appear that the only thing that might prevent Replicants from ever being built would be a possible ethical/political dilemma much like the one that surrounds cloning. (3) The weather and environment appears to be drearier. As global warming theories and oil and other toxic spills become more prevalent, this event is quite possible. (4) Big Corporations still exist and exert their influence. From the Coke billboards to the billboards offering a better life on a space colony, consumers are still being told that their life is inadequate but could be madebetter if they purchased certain products or moved to a \\"better\\" location.   Watching the movie leaves one with the feeling of awe. The realism of situations and special effects only serve to enhance this effect. This movie is a much watch for any fan of science fiction, or to anyone who wants to get a look into the future.
B004B4RCDE|1.0|This time around, rihanna has upped the swagger and downplayed the quality of the music.     Rated R was a commercial misfire, despite excessive pushing of the label (inflation of sales and a desperate rush of singles). However, Rated R took a out of the box approach that made it actually memorable for those who listened to it. This album will not share the same fate. It is ordinary, pick of the litter pop fluff that wouldn't sound out of place on a miley cyrus cd. Rated R had grime and dirt all over it. With Loud, she is treading water.    The decision to make a purely superficial record seems calculated due to the previous flop record..the marketing gimmick is to not improve any particular sound, but simply try to regurgitate something that has come before. God forbid a record label would throw caution to the wind and take another gamble.     The opening single actually does the trick. The song is intended to subliminally isolate the listener into accepting Rihanna as the \\"only girl\\" in the world...altering focus of the generic beat and tired lyrics. The second single simply stinks up the room even more effectively than a wet bag of potatoes. And the overcooked drake appearance? Snooze. The Nicky Minaj track? Don't bother. The rather desperate \\"S&M\\"? Madonna did that in the 90's and Janet did that a year ago!    They needed to make R more of a name brand so they infested in the BEST producers, and made a mish mash or what made GGGB work. Make no mistake, Loud will be a success and will have its moment in the sun...but the darkness is just around the corner and it's what I'm eager to see more fully explored.     But the chick herself is fabulous and a total star the entire time. No hate here. Keep proving them wrong, Girl!
B002O1TMI4|5.0|This album was bought on a whim, and I cannot be happier with it! I have loved it. The music and vocals are so well blended, the lyrics are clever and lovely, and the overall effect is wonderful. Undisclosed Desires is currently one of my favorite songs! This has made me want to get more of their music. Highly recommended!
0394721780|4.0|I ordered two of these books, because one of my friend enjoyed the movie, and this will be her Christmas gift; one is for me. Julia Child's recipies are very explicit, she explains what wines go when and with what, what kitchen tools to buy , and alternatives in case you can't buy the ones suggested. Also she tells you the cuts of meat, which is from where and how it should be cooked. I love this book!
0793518326|4.0|Pro's<br />-------<br />1) A robust work - is it complete, is it perfect? Dunno.<br />2) Contains Vocals notation and lyrics, Guitar(s) notation and tab, Bass notation and tab, and drums - makes a great way for your band to get all the beatles songs in one place.<br />3) Price is very reasonable for what you are getting.<br />4) Includes a nice discography of british single, british Albums, American singles, American Albums at the back.<br /><br />Cons<br />------<br />1) Basically the form factor is the con - pages are 10\\" x 7\\", the book is 2\\" thick. Hard bound form factor and 1130+ pages means it won't lay flat on a music stand. More of a \\"desk reference\\" than a song book.<br />2) Font and notation is fairly small -- kind of hard to read! Maybe I'm getting old.<br />3) I saw some notation that looked non-standard, for instance references to string bends and so forth were not \\"typical\\" guitar notation.<br /><br />General comments<br />------------------<br />This is a great idea, and the authors are to be commended for completing this project and for making this available. I only just received it so I can't comment on the accuracy of the transcriptions so please rely on other reviews for that. Its a massive work and if you are a beatles fan, or have a band that wants to play beatles tunes - this seems like a must have.<br /><br />General improvements would be to increase the page size to that of a typical song book, improving the font size and notation size. Spiral bind it and put it in 3-4 volumes so it would lay flat on a music stand.<br /><br />You get a lot for your money here...a good value. Overall, I really like this because I play guitar, bass, and keyboards and it will be fun to work from these transcripts and lay down and combine tracks.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to any beatles fan that wants to take a shot at some of their songs.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Pleased with the time delivery.  DVD does have 3 places where it freezes but starts again for 2 and I have to start the 3rd one.  Love this movie in all ways.

1440503257|5.0|My 11 year old daughter is very much into Harry Potter, she also enjoys to cook. When I gave her this book she got very excited.  That was a few months ago and she's still making recipes from it.  The book hasn't left the kitchen counter yet.  She's constantly trying new things. The book is easy to follow and the stuff she makes is actually pretty good.  Many of the things she does on her own but some of them we help.  All in all a very good purchase, everyone in the house has benefited ;)
B0044KU7KU|5.0|I have been a fan of MCR since 2005 when I stumbled on the music video for Helena. I have never been disappointed with their work since then. I have always enjoyed their music and the boys never fail to amaze me. This album is quite simply an example of a band refusing to compromise their art. You may not like it or it might not be what you expected. But, really? Why would you be satisfied with exactly what you expected? This album isn't perfect but it is passionate. It is art. As soon as it begins, you are transported into the band's imagination. You can't help but wish this album were a movie, a graphic novel, anything to make it bigger and to tell you the whole story. It leaves you wanting more in the greatest way possible. It leaves you wanting to insanely scream the lyrics out of your car window. If you don't buy the album, at least download \\"Sing\\". For best enjoyment, listen to it at max volume. Killjoys, make some noise!
B0041T52S6|2.0|Honestly, I love fantasy and cartoons come to life in a movie.....this unfortunately did not succeed in it's attempt. Maye some 10 year old will like it in their hormone confusion but outside of that.....even pot doesn't make it any better!!!!!
B003ZK58WM|2.0|I have read and thoroughly enjoyed THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH and A DANGEROUS FORTUNE and EYE OF THE NEEDLE by Ken Follett.  These were well written anf flowed nicely and intelligently...like a well educated adult would tell a story.  FALL OF GIANTS is none of this as if the story is being laid out by a much less skilled storeyteller...disappointing for a Follett work :(
B000A88EVE|2.0|What is it with Criterion? Yes, we are grateful for the DVD release of classics, obscurities and under appreciated gems but enough with the bloated prices already!!!  I can believe that the rules of supply and demand dictate higher prices for Criterion's releases as they will not sell like your average Hollywood blockbuster. And I suppose that a great deal of legal wrangling with estates and the like, not to mention actual film restoration and editing rev up their costs but $56.00 for The Man who fell to Earth?! Come on! Maybe a few less bells and whistles with each film. I could do without a commentary from some film critic or interviews with the director from some Belgian TV program in 1976. Just give us the movies at a more reasonable price.
B0042816YK|4.0|Julia Roberts returns to the screen in the much anticipated adaption of Elizabeth Gilbert's memoir \\"Eat, Pray, Love.\\" No doubt this film will bring in many viewers due to the high-grossing memoir and what has been come to be called the Oprah effect. Oprah Winfrey has devoted TV shows to the book (one of her book club's selections) and recently a show was aired featuring Julia Roberts.      Julia, as Elizabeth Gilbert, is thirty-something, married and working in New York as a writer. She comes to the realization that she feels nothing for the life she has created and her marriage ends. After a messy divorce and another failed relationship, Elizabeth embarks on a year round trip to Italy, India and Bali.      In Italy, Elizabeth finds friendship and discovers how to relax and enjoy life. In India, her quest becomes more spiritual and she befriends Richard from Texas, played by Richard Jenkins. By example, Richard helps Elizabeth find forgiveness in herself. In Bali, she continues her spiritual pursuit while trying to find balance in life. Elizabeth becomes smitten with a Brazilian, played by Javier Bardem, and must decide if she can maintain her own individuality while falling in love.      The story line is well written by Ryan Murphy (of Glee Fame) and Jennifer Salt and the acting is top notch as it should be with such a gifted cast. This will become a highly regarded film for Roberts, although not to the degree as her Oscar-winning portrayal of \\"Erin Brockovich.\\" If any actors are noticed during award season, Richard Jenkins and Javier Bardem may have to compete with each other for supporting nods. The movie is beautifully film by Cinematographer Robert Richardson and will be a delight for anyone starved for beautiful scenery.      Yes, this film could be classified as a chick film, but the lessons of a life well lived make the film more than just a nice interlude. It is a thoughtful film with messages that are deeper than any chick flick could ever hope to produce. This film will speak to anyone that has found times when they were in need of nourishment, inspiration and love.    \\"Eat Pray Love\\" is rated PG-13 and has a run time of 2 hrs. and 13 minutes    Enjoy this review?

0451228375|5.0|Ken Follett's \\"World Without End\\" and \\"Pillars of The Earth\\" are the two finest Novels I've read. I might even like World a bit more than Pillars because I found the characters in World to be so interesting. I just recently purchased The Pillars DVD(great entertainment)and would hope World would also make it's way to film. I would love to see Keira Knightley play the wonderful role of Caris. Emma Watson would also be an excellent choice. Both these young ladies are world class actors, and would be wonderful in the role, which in my opinion is the center piece of the book. \\"World Without End\\" is another great read by Ken Follett.
1932100660|5.0|I got this book in record time and it is in excellent condition. I don't buy books any other way except through Amazon now. Always the best deal and so convenient. Love it.

B00005OBSD|5.0|What a magnificent debut album \\"Tons Of Sobs\\" is! Recorded October 1968 - around the same time Led Zeppelin recorded their first album - Free was then one of the most promising acts to have come from the UK. Their music was impressively solid, full of raw energy and great musical taste. In short, the band - Paul Rodgers, Paul Kossoff, Andy Fraser and Simon Kirke - was \\"cooking\\"!  Beginning and ending with the magically acoustic \\"Over The Green Hills pt 1&2\\" was an interesting decision as it sets the mood for things to come perfectly just to calm things down from all the thunder at the end. The moment \\"Worry\\" kicks in with that screaming guitar then followed by the rawest, purest singing Paul Rodgers has ever commited to tape, we know this must be one of those treasures from the late sixties. They then carry on with the heavy, bluesy riffing of \\"Walk In My Shadow\\", get well into the blues with \\"Going Down Slow\\" with Kossoff's great licks followed by \\"I'm A Mover\\", \\"Moonshine\\", \\"Sweet Tooth\\"... They just can't do no wrong here. Impossible. This is one of those rare moments captured for posterity. Quite a shame they would never be this focused and spontaneous as shown by their subsequent releases which seemed to have let Free's raw power dwindle.  I would definitely recommend this remastered edition as it brings forth all the brilliance this once great band emanated! The fact 'Tons of Sobs' is a classic in every way is undeniable.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I received the Blu-Ray set yesterday and have already watched some of all three discs. I saw the movie twice in the theatre in 3D and also bought the early release in late April, so I am familiar with the movie. As for the set, I think that most (not all) of the additions in the 16 minute added version were worthwhile. The main reason I bought the set was for the special features on the other two discs. The documentary on disc two is wonderful. The Scene Deconstruction on disc three reinforced the material in the documentary and was a revelation. I decided to  watch it in the performance capture mode with the actors on the set. It amazed me how accurately all the nuances of an actors performance have been preserved in the final digital rendition. I also loved the 'Message from Pandora' showing James Cameron and the others with the  rain forest natives in Brazil, and working to stop construction of the dams on the Xingu River. For those who love the movie, I highly recommend this set.

031603438X|4.0|obviously the Stones live a life few of us can relate to, but the history of rock n roll portrayed here is first rate.   If you are in your 50-60's this should ring a lot of bells for you.  The Stones were at the forefront of a music revolution and Keith does a great job of portraying what happened to and around him and his part in it.  A great read for that, though there are long passages i could have skipped.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I bought this game along with a batch of other games for the holidays to have for family and friends to play after meals and by far, it was the one that received the most play time over Thanksgiving.  I wanted to have games that had quick rounds (~20-30 minutes) so that everyone could play and rules that were easy to learn and explain.  It's a great little game to have on your shelf as it's easy to jump in and play and easy for players of all ages to enjoy.<br /><br />While the concepts seem simple at first blush, the great thing about Blokus is that there's really no one right way or one right strategy to winning the game and everyone has a chance to win a round because of the dynamic nature of the game.<br /><br />My wife and I bust it out and play two-player rounds by the fire once in a while as well.<br /><br />If you like this type of game, I'd also recommend Rumis which is very similar to this game by plays in 3-dimensions instead of 2.  It's another great game that's easy for players of all ages to jump into and play.
B00004TJKI|3.0|It's way too long.  Jimmy Stewart is very good at playing Jimmy Stewart but there's just too much \\"cute country boy\\" happening here for my taste.  The fellow who plays his adorable alcoholic side-kick is even more annoyingly cute, and isn't it nice that he ends up kicking the habit?!  Ben Gazzara has a compelling presence but his character is so one-dimensional that no one cares.  The lovely, wonderful Lee Remick is either badly cast or terribly directed.  She is far too intelligent to play such a bimbo and her attempts at being a trailer-trash flirt are almost embarassing.      On the plus side, Eve Arden brings her smart, cut-through-the bs presence and the man who played the judge, who I understand was a real judge, was excellent.  Also on the plus side was the presence of a young George C. Scott as the fancy lawyer from the big city of Lansing.  Some have called his performance over-the-top and that may be so, but at least I woke up when he came on screen.  The close-ups of Scott and Remick on the witness stand are quite wonderful.  Another plus is a brief appearance by the always charming Orson Beane.     The worst thing about this film, in my opinion, is the story.  Perhaps the book makes a better case for this defense of irresistable urge or whatever they called it.  But, to me, it held no water at all....And since the whole story depended on it, I just had to roll my eyes and chalk the whole film up to the mentality of another era when that might have had some credibility.    Fans of Jimmy Stewart will love this because he's on the screen for almost the whole three hours. I kept hoping for some views of Michigan's Upper Penninsula, but alas, there's not much of that to redeem the film.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I would just like to say that my daughter and I stood in line for 5 hours prior to this movie coming out into the theater. Personally as a 35 old mother I didn't think that this whole \\"Twilight\\" vampire/werewolf phenomenon would last very long. When I first heard of the Twilight movie I told my daughter I was not going to take her to the movies to see something about vampires. So, when the DVD came out she begged me to buy it for her so I broke down and did I have to say to my surprise I really truly enjoyed the movie I had an instant romance with Jacob Black although they didn't show him as often as they did in New Moon I still officially became a part of Team Jacob. Of course that is my sons name but still have you seen his abs wow LOL anyway I have become a really great fan of the Twilight Saga and I if you think that is great check out Vampire Diaries you want to see some hot vampires they put Edward to shame seriously it come on the CW Thursday nights @ 8pm. I am so addicted to that show, But, back to the topic of Eclipse this movie was amazing from beginning to end personally I think Bella Swan is a tease and that is how they portray her character I feel that she changes her mind too much one minute in the Twilight she is absolutely obsessed with Edward then he bails on her and she turns to Jacob of course at first it is nothing other then a friendship but then Jacob has to go and confess his feelings to her and that is where the story gets complicated first Jacob makes a promise to Bella that he would never leave her then he turns around and does exactly that. I didn't understand that part or why Stephanie Myers chose to have Jacob leave Bella after he promised her he wouldn't because that is what Edward did to her after endangering her life. So, for me New Moon was a little more confusing and the story kind of went in circles for me until the end but of course leaving the world hanging with a proposal I mean come on you know how long we had to wait. Then as I am watching Eclipse I mean come on why make Bella want to initiate the sex it is bad enough personally she is coming off as a tease as it is she is leading two arch enemies along. She is constantly telling Jacob that she loves him but then she tells Edward the same thing it really doesn't make sense then she clobbers Jacob right in the face when he kisses her and then she begs him to kiss her I mean that to me spells TEASE. I enjoyed the movie I just wasn't sure why Stephanie Myers portrays Bella Swan as a tease. I feel that she is torn between two people but they both abandoned her when she needed them the most. Overall I would say I am excited  about the release of the third installment of the Twilight saga. God bless and I hope everyone has a safe and pleasant holiday season.I am watching Eclipse I mean come on why make Bella want to initiate the sex it is bad enough personally she is coming off as a tease as it is she is leading two arch enemies along.

B0047VSW30|2.0|I'm a pretty big fan of movies set in ancient history as well as ones that revolve around politics, science, and religion but I could not, for the life of me, get into this movie. I got so bored I ended up stopping it before it was over. I feel like the acting just wasn't filled with enough emotion.
B0001FYPZU|1.0|What a disappointment!  I was so excited to watch this film, however it is for Region 2 and will not play on my DVD player.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|Great mini tripod with many uses! I use it for my iPhone 4 to record band rehearsals and as an auxilliary camera when recording shows. The grip can unscrew so you can screw it to a tripod plate and mount it on a bigger tripod for prosumer and pro cameras.  Great deal for $20ish.
B0000AUHOH|2.0|Star Trek V has a bad reputation. The criticism of the film has been so harsh that actually watching it might be a pleasant surprise, as long as you're in a charitable mood. Sure, it is definitely the worst of the [[ASIN:B001TH16DI first six]] Star Trek movies. But, for the first two-thirds, it's a reasonably interesting adventure, which at least is more than I can say about [[ASIN:6305181721 Generations]] and [[ASIN:B00005JLRT Nemesis]].    The first act isn't bad. Kirk's assault on Paradise City is a competent action scene, and Chekov has a good scene (that doesn't involve him getting hurt, for once) where he tries to distract Sybok by posing as the captain. Sybok is one of the less interesting villains in the series (again, Generations makes him look pretty good), but he shows some charisma in the opening scene, where he converts some guy in the desert.    Also, I actually don't mind the goofy humour in the script. I could have done without the more slapstick moments (the one where Scotty hits his head on a bulkhead is just kind of mean), but the scenes on El Capitan and around the campfire are actually surprisingly good. Although McCoy is maybe too much of an angry old man and not enough of a good-natured ironist, at least he's finally hanging out with Kirk and Spock, and gets more dialogue than usual. Kirk's thoughts on dying alone are truly affecting (Shatner makes the lines sound like the product of genuine reflection), and underscore the friendship that forms the biggest theme of the original series. The small bits with Chekov and Sulu getting lost, and Uhura bringing Scotty dinner, are also quite nice. Not every Star Trek story has to be serious, sometimes it's okay to have a light-hearted adventure while showing the characters being comfortable in their decades-long interactions.    The second act, where Kirk, Spock and McCoy evade Sybok aboard the Enterprise, is also pretty good. I'm not fond of the big revelation about Sybok's relation to Spock -- it's one of those huge plot twists that have never been so much as suggested in the entire history of Star Trek up to this moment, then are totally forgotten as soon as they serve their purpose in the movie. It would have accomplished the same thing if they had just been childhood friends, or something. But the scene where Sybok uses his method on Spock and McCoy is excellent. DeForest Kelley gives the best performance of all his years of playing McCoy, convincingly showing how his character felt helpless and never forgave himself for not being able to cure his father's illness. Shatner provides the perfect counterpoint to the scene, when Kirk refuses to play by Sybok's rules and snarls that he refuses to reveal his \\"pain.\\" It is very appropriate to Kirk's character.    Unfortunately, the third act is terribly bad. Not only does the movie completely forget about the whole Paradise City subplot, but the resolution of Sybok's mystical quest is unbelievably dumb. Imagine if [[ASIN:B00005JKHP The Motion Picture]] had ended with a gunfight against giant robots, and you have something like the ending of The Final Frontier. Allegedly, Paramount stiffed Shatner on the special effects money, but it's not their fault. Sadly, the blame belongs entirely with [[ASIN:142764229X Shatner]], who couldn't think of a better ending for his own story. And it's not that hard to think of one. For example, it would have been much better to do something like [[ASIN:B000063V8U that one episode]] of Next Generation where Picard discovers a secret message from the earliest humanoids -- that would have conveyed all the stuff about how god exists inside every person, without the lame action sequence. It would also have made more sense than bringing in the Klingons [[ASIN:B00006G8HX yet again]] and making it so that absolutely everyone in the entire crew somehow doesn't notice them decloaking.    The problem with the movie is that it goes through a bunch of reasonably good ideas, uses each one only long enough for one plot point, and then discards it. Like how the Paradise City planet and the diplomats are forgotten after the first act (if you're giving David Warner a supporting role, you really ought to give him something to work with), or how Sybok is unceremoniously shoved out of the picture during the conclusion, or how Spock and McCoy accompany Kirk to the planet only to make comments and get beamed out. None of the supporting characters really feels that important to the plot -- they all feel arbitrary, like Shatner is just making up the story as he goes along. Which he probably did.    It is a very muddled movie. If you don't like Star Trek, it will confirm your views. But, if you're familiar with the characters, it's watchable and occasionally even good. You do have to lower your expectations a bit, though.
B002JVWR4K|5.0|As the title states, this is perhaps the best season yet of Bones.  While it lacks a interconnecting story line(like most shows nowadays) it's strength lies in its all in one type episodes and constantly evolving relationship between Booth and Brennan.  Fans of the show will be both shocked and awed at what is in store for them in this 5 disc set.  One of the best shows on tv just got better and I for one am anxiously awaiting the complete season 6 set!!
B0018QCXGY|5.0|this blu-ray release looks amazing and is a superb update to the standard def disc.  i remember seeing this film with a large group of friends which was amazing on the big screen and we talked about it frequently for several weeks after.  i ended up seeing it twice in the theater and 3 or 4 times so far on disc.  this movie may not be for everyone but imo it's a true classic masterpiece.
0307474712|4.0|I'm amused by the reviewers who didn't like the book because Dexter Mayhew was so unlikeable - 'cause that's kind of the point, isn't it? Nicholls makes him so real; Dexter is deeply flawed but rather charmingly aware of his failings - well, most of them. And we don't get \\"perfect\\" in our search for a life partner, nor do our loved ones. I loved the exploration of relationships in this book. It's a fairly brilliant look at the fine line between friendship and romance and the dance we all do with commitment. Emma Morley's acceptance of Dexter's faults, along with acknowledgement of her own weaknesses, made her more appealing, rather than less.<br /><br />Although I felt the premise was a little contrived and there were a few plot points where I lost interest just a bit (which is why I'm shying away five stars), the witty dialogue made up for the book's minor problems. The sarcasm that defines the tension between the two friends is highly entertaining. And the author's take on growing older is clever and well drawn. \\"It would be inappropriate, undignified, at thirty-eight, to conduct friendships or love affairs with the ardour and intensity of a twenty-two year old. Writing poetry, crying at pop songs? Dragging people into photo-booths . . .?\\"<br /><br />Nicholls captures our \\"everyman\\" awkwardness beautifully, describing Emma's attempts at flirtation as \\"graceless and inept, \\"like normal conversations on roller skates.\\" Ultimately, you find yourself pulling for the Emma and Dex to find whatever it is that makes them happy - together or apart. I don't always care deeply about the characters I read, but I definitely became emotionally invested in the outcome of the story. Emma and Dexter will stay with you long after the book's dramatic ending.
B00005JKHP|4.0|The first Star Trek film is often unfavourably compared to [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001: A Space Odyssey]]. It has a similar slow pace, and relies more on \\"ideas\\" (i.e. grand statements about humanity) and unworldly visuals, rather than on action sequences or the relationships between the Star Trek characters. How could a silly pop culture phenomenon possibly outdo a Kubrick epic?    Well, I may be in the minority, but I'll make that case anyway. The Motion Picture is actually better than 2001. Granted, The Motion Picture doesn't really have any ideas, aside from \\"emotions are an important part of the human experience\\" and \\"wow, actions sure do have unexpected consequences sometimes.\\" But then, 2001 doesn't have any ideas either, aside from \\"humanity has evolved before and will do so again.\\" The Motion Picture has less characterization than some Trek fans might like, but 2001 has no characterization whatsoever. Kubrick had classical music on his side, but Star Trek has a very impressive original score.    Ultimately, both films are mostly just visual spectacles, and in that respect, Star Trek wins hands down. The light show in 2001 is colourful, but looks simplistic and dated. The visuals in Star Trek are much more detailed and amorphous. The interior of V'Ger looks like a fascinatingly moody abstract painting, full of subtle shades of dark blue. The landforms that emerge inside (like the walk toward the end) look enigmatic and mysterious -- strange and dreamlike, but not as jarring as the sterile room at the end of 2001. The long shots of the Enterprise have been criticized, but they too are quite pretty. After all, the ship itself has an extremely memorable visual design. Its bright white exterior looks tremendously appealing, especially when compared to the unnecessarily dark design of some [[ASIN:B00005JLRT later]] Trek films.    Like in 2001, the storyline often takes a backseat to the visuals. In some sense, the use of the Star Trek universe works to the film's advantage. These are well-known, recognizable characters. The film tweaks them a little bit, but mostly you're expected to know them already. In that sense, the movie is like a TV episode, which relies on the viewers' basic knowledge of the characters, and thus can afford to put something else in the spotlight.    It's also much more like science fiction than any other Trek film, or even most Trek shows. It's no surprise that [[ASIN:B000RZIGVS The Next Generation]] borrowed some ideas from The Motion Picture (Riker and Troi started as copies of Decker and Ilia), since The Next Generation itself had the best science fiction, the most \\"strange new worlds,\\" of all the different series. Later Trek films are [[ASIN:B0000683DH revenge dramas]], [[ASIN:B0000UJL96 political allegories]], and [[ASIN:6305127638 action-adventures]]. Those things are all great, but there is nothing inherently \\"science fiction\\" about them, you can tell those kinds of stories in any setting. The Motion Picture, however, attempts to depict a genuinely unearthly, inexplicable phenomenon, the likes of which no one has ever seen. At its best, the movie really conveys that feeling of discovering something unknowable and mysterious.    Not to say that it's perfect. For instance, the wormhole scene is inane. It pops out of nowhere, involves pointless slow-motion effects, has an arbitrary resolution (why would torpedoes work on it, but not phasers?), and plays no real role in the plot aside from providing a flimsy excuse for Kirk to get angry at Decker. The romance between Decker and Ilia was under-developed, also. Apparently Ilia was supposed to come from some kind of oversexed, ultra-seductive culture (she has to take an \\"oath of celibacy\\" to be allowed to serve on the Enterprise), but this is never really explored. In fact, the director's cut removes those lines from the script altogether, probably for the better.    On the other hand, Decker's anguish after Ilia's transformation is quite compelling. Also, Spock's acceptance of his human side is surprisingly effective, for such an obvious plot device. The scene where he grasps Kirk's hand in sickbay, and uses V'Ger's lack of emotions as an analogy for his own aloofness, is touching. The other characters get very little screen time (but Chekov somehow finds the time to get hurt, oh ho ho). This is fine for the original series, where they were always in the background, serving as loyal merry men for Kirk's epic hero. It would have been nice to give McCoy something to do, though -- he gets the short end of the stick in almost all of the movies.    However, the finale is quite stunning, if you see this film for the first time without spoiling it for yourself. It isn't deep, but it is certainly a creative twist. Not only that, but it somehow perfectly encapsulates the optimism that made the original series appealing -- it temporarily causes one to believe that maybe humans will really be able to explore such strange mysteries in the far reaches of space one day. It's a very uplifting ending.    Perhaps the best way to think about The Motion Picture is to view it as a very good two-part episode of the original series. It uses the character types without really going deep into them, but it uses them effectively. Once you get to the visuals, you can be assured of seeing Star Trek at its grandest.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I only recently discovered Brandi Carlile. They play her some on the the Coffee House on XM. This is the type of cd you put in and listen to every song. I'm actually surprised she's not a bigger name at this point.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|The movie starts out slow, but with a bleak reality that clearly puts the viewer in the backwoods of the Missouri Ozarks, and not in Hollywood. I like how the actors seem so much like real people, from their non-glamorous looks to their gritty toughness. Jennifer Lawrence plays the part of 17-year old Ree Dolly who is faced with the care of her two younger siblings as well as their practically catatonic mother. Besides this, she also splits wood, looks after the animals and attends high school. The father of the family is missing. Like many others of this clan, he is embroiled in cooking meth.  Most of the cast of characters are quite gaunt and disheveled in appearance, and this, along with their grim and paranoid behavior adds to the believability of the situation. It seems that Ree's dad, Jessop, has gotten himself in deep trouble both with the law and with the clan, and Ree takes on tortuous task of finding him so that she can redeem their house and property which Jessop has ransomed to make bail before he disappeared. The obstacles she must surmount on the way, from the tight-lipped backwoods people to violence and risk of more serious injury would turn a lesser person away. But Ree is relentless in her determination, and also never asks for pity. Things got pretty chilling at toward the end, but there is some hope redeemed also. A memorable and haunting film. Recommend.
B00006G8HX|3.0|This movie is much weaker than either of the [[ASIN:B00005JKHP first]] [[ASIN:B0000683DH two]]. But then, it has to be. From the start, it is based on an inherently hokey premise: after The Wrath Of Khan, another Star Trek movie could only exist if it found a way to bring Spock back from the dead. Of course, there's no way to do that believably.    So, the writers use the crutch of Vulcan mysticism, and invent a ritual whereby Spock can be resurrected. The Vulcans have so many super powers that, by all rights, they really ought to be running the entire Federation. They're already super-smart, super-strong, and live for hundreds of years, and now they also have immortal souls that can be transferred between bodies. Even less believable is the idea that Kirk would know nothing about these aspects of Vulcan culture, despite being best friends with a Vulcan for years. Don't they have liberal arts requirements at Starfleet Academy?    But, miraculously, all this is almost palatable, because they bring back [[ASIN:B000059XU0 Mark Lenard]] as Spock's somber father. For me, much of the appeal of the entire Star Trek franchise comes from its remarkable luck in finding actors with precisely this kind of old-fashioned acting style. Mark Lenard, David Warner, Ricardo Montalban, and even the much-ridiculed William Shatner all have a mannered, theatrical diction and bearing, a style that is unsuitable for realistic, \\"modern\\" stories, but perfect for depicting epic archetypes. In fact, by the time this movie was made, Star Trek might have been the only place to find this style of acting -- outside this franchise, you'd have to go all the way back to old black-and-white Hollywood films. But there is always a place for this old style. For instance, I admire the acting of [[ASIN:B0006GAOJA Robert De Niro]], but he'd never have been able to play [[ASIN:0140447946 Agamemnon]], or [[ASIN:0374525749 Odysseus]], or, dare I say, Captain Kirk.    So Mark Lenard arrives to deliver the idiotic plot device concocted by the writers, but he is so grave and dignified while doing so that it almost sort of makes sense. Kirk's show of respect for the stern old Vulcan is also quite affecting. The ensuing scenes draw on another one of Star Trek's great strengths, the theme of friendship and loyalty between Kirk and his crew. The entire first half of the movie, up until the first space battle, is excellent, because Kirk's love of his captaincy and his ship was always key to his character, and it is genuinely moving to watch him push himself to sacrifice those things for the sake of friendship. The ending of the first space battle is completely awe-inspiring -- not only because of the sacrifice involved, but because it is a brilliant piece of strategy on Kirk's part. Unlike many Star Trek victories, it is not a deus ex machina (\\"we suddenly discovered a new type of beam that makes the bad guys spontaneously combust\\"), but rather, the product of audacious thinking and cunning.    The resolution is less clever, though. Christopher Lloyd, as the Klingon warrior Kruge, is a competent villain (not as good as Ricardo Montalban, but maybe that's an unfair comparison), with an imperious bearing that fits his status as \\"lord.\\" But with him, the franchise began to invent a goofy medievalist warrior culture for the Klingons. In my opinion, this makes it much more difficult to take them seriously as modern, Cold-War-style adversaries. They are much more interesting in [[ASIN:B0000UJL96 The Undiscovered Country]].    And I dislike the way the movie cavalierly dispenses with the entire Genesis story from The Wrath Of Khan. In the second movie, Genesis made a good symbol, one that gave additional meaning to Spock's sacrifice. Furthermore, even though Kirk, due to his adventurous character, can't ever possibly settle down with a wife and son, it was a good touch to show that he still had a family out there somewhere. The way this movie does away with that is pointlessly callous.At least Robin Curtis is a better Saavik than Kirstie Alley, and gets a great, sympathetic scene with the young Spock (too bad they didn't have the guts to show Kirk's reference to her \\"condition\\" during their goodbye in The Voyage Home).    The conflict ends with a fist-fight in the middle of exploding special effects, which is quite dumb. In the sixties, Shatner had enough youthful machismo to pull that off on the TV series, but here, he's not a very credible contender in hand-to-hand combat. He is a much more convincing leader during the space battles, where he can be daring in his schemes instead of his physical strength.    Perhaps this was the first Star Trek movie where the plot development was visibly influenced by marketing concerns, from the premise to the resolution. A lot of it is quite engrossing, and uses the characters very well. But it's not the one to go to if you want Star Trek at its best.
1607882302|5.0|I love Tony Hsieh's story.  He is not only very smart, but wise beyond his years.  I would recommend this book and audio program to anyone who wants to know how to succeed in life!
B003EYVY0E|1.0|Unlike the first two \\"Ultimate Editions\\" they didn't bother to include the deleted scenes back into the movie. You are only paying extra for some cards and special features which doesn't make it worth it. I only bought these because I assumed they would continue on like the first two movies and include the full movie with the deleted scenes. I will not bother wasting anymore money on these.
B00000ILBK|4.0|Insurrection is hugely under-rated. It is by far the best of the [[ASIN:6305609659 four TNG films]], the only one to really capture the spirit of the show. This is important, because TNG was in turn the only Trek show to really capture the humanist idealism that allegedly inspired creator Gene Roddenberry.    The [[ASIN:B001DHXT6G original series]] had an optimistic tone, and contained many interesting and thought-provoking episodes, but it was really more about Captain Kirk's epic, larger-than-life personality than anything else. But Captain Picard was a highly educated intellectual, the type of person who really does believe in all that stuff about peace, truth, and non-interference in alien cultures. Compared to the original series, TNG had more complex and morally ambiguous storylines, and Picard would often struggle with moral issues. Yet, he would eventually firmly insist on doing the right, principled thing, even if it went against the more \\"realist,\\" realpolitik view of his superiors.     Sadly, the TNG movies largely ignored this aspect of the show. Instead, they tried to make Picard into an action hero just like Kirk. For instance, the abysmal [[ASIN:6305181721 Generations]] contains a goofy geriatric fist-fight involving Kirk, Picard and [[ASIN:B000UJ48T0 Caligula]].    Insurrection is the only TNG movie to get it right. It's about a moral problem. In a remote area of the Federation, there's a planet with some kind of energy field that makes it so that all the inhabitants live forever, without aging. The planet is technically inside Federation borders, but it was never really explored. So, Federation authorities never made official contact with the indigenous population. For their part, the locals prefer to live in idyllic isolation, without outside visitors.    Clearly, the secret of eternal youth is valuable to the Federation, but Federation scientists don't know how to collect the magical planet energy. Along comes a band of ugly space thugs, led by [[ASIN:B00006DEFA F. Murray Abraham]], with the necessary technology to do this (and destroy the planet in the process). So, Starfleet decides to secretly join forces with the space thugs, and use them to do the dirty work of forcibly relocating the inhabitants of the planet. By chance, Picard and his gallant crew stumble upon this conspiracy, and hijinks ensue. Is it moral for the Federation to force the people off their planet, when they're not even Federation subjects? What about the involvement of the space thugs? Will Picard allow the corrupt Starfleet admiral to flout the declared ideals of the Federation? Ah, now there's a classic TNG setup.    Naturally, Picard stands up for principle, and opposes the conspiracy. But the focus is on the problem, not the individual villains. The leader of the space thugs is not very prominent. F. Murray Abraham gives a clipped, terse performance that is very understated, compared to the epic grandstanding of [[ASIN:B0000683DH Ricardo Montalban]] or [[ASIN:B0000UJL96 Christopher Plummer]]. While the guy is much less exciting than Khan or Chang, that's the point. There's no Shakespearean greatness in his evil, he's basically just a run-of-the-mill hoodlum. The corrupt Starfleet admiral is a weak bureaucrat, opportunistic but not hugely evil, who never expected the scheme to turn deadly. The issue, that a Starfleet admiral would ever stoop so low, is more important than the individuals involved.    Perhaps this firm insistence on principle was what made the movie unpopular. For instance, [[ASIN:0767910389 Roger Ebert]] didn't see why it was so wrong to relocate the planet people. Granted, they seem a bit selfish, but they have a pretty sound argument. From a \\"liberal\\" viewpoint, forced relocation is cruel and inhumane, and from a \\"conservative\\" viewpoint, the planet is their property, which they never agreed to share with any big-government Federation. But, the honest message of Insurrection clashes with the recent trend in moviesand TV to excuse the nominal \\"good guys\\" from any moral responsibility for their actions.    Among the crew, the movie mostly focuses on Picard and Data, as usual. But, Riker and Troi get a couple of great scenes, reminding us that their relationship was actually pretty important in the show. Geordi and Worf get a couple of good moments as well. Really, only Dr. Crusher gets stiffed; they can't seem to find anything for her to do in the TNG films. As for Data, the writers are miraculously able to put a new spin on his quest to be human, which had become a trainwreck after Generations gave him emotions. Now, despite having emotions, he suddenly realizes that he was never a child, and can never grow old, allowing us to see a bit of the calm yet puzzled Data of the good old days.    There are action scenes, but Picard's involvement in them is toned down compared to the other TNG films. The obligatory space battle is handled by Riker, while Picard shames the corrupt admiral with his stoic, principled defiance. That's the way it should be: Riker does the fighting, Picard does the thinking. Picard also gets a romance, which was probably unnecessary (if he really needed a hot older girlfriend, Dr. Crusher is right there), but is still much sweeter and more convincing than his bizarre interactions with Lily in [[ASIN:6305127638 First Contact]].    The movie also has a light tone in many scenes. I could have gone without the part with the goofy singing, but other than that, the humour is cute without being irritating. Certainly it is miles above the horrible one-liners of Generations. It gives the movie a comforting feeling -- finally, the TNG crew does things that reflect their personalities as developed in the show, as well as their friendships. Bottom line: definitely the best TNG film, and the moral aspect puts it on par with some of the classic Trek films, as well.
B003ZFVIDA|5.0|Another 180 gram re-release and this time its complete with bonus songs. I am a vinyl collector and my opinion goes both ways when it comes to all the re-releases that the record companies are putting out on vinyl. If you do not have a good copy of Bona Drag, this is the one that you would want to purchase. It comes with six extra tracks that Morrissey has never released on an official release. Four of the tracks were never heard unless you were in the Moz family of friends because unreleased tracks were never kept secret. A few of these tracks may have showed up in inferior quality on one or two bootleg releases. There is also a long mix of the Moz B-side, \\"Let The Right One Slip In\\" and a demo version of \\"Please Help The Cause Against The Loneliness\\". These extra songs are so good that I wondered why he never wanted to release them before? I should state that I am a longtime fan of The Smiths and I used to be a devout Moz fan but now a casual listener. My taste in his music went by the wayside right around the time that in my opinion his last somewhat good album was released entitled You Are The Quarry. If someone said a bad word about him to me during the nineties I would have defended his name to the death. But he last eight to ten years his albums have been about half entertaining compared to his earlier catalog. I am a fan of the band he had working with him through the nineties. They were solid and Morrissey's brilliant writing was always sounded top notch with that band. This release of Bona Drag sounds fantastic. If you are familiar with Drag you probably know that all 14 songs are superb top notch tracks. Its sort a greatest hits/single release. The original Bona was his second studio release and this new one is the twentieth anniversary issue. This was released on Major Minor records and they did an awesome job with the double LP packaging including the new photos and color that they used compared to the ones they used on the original Bona Drag. Hope this helps Morrissey fans. If you are new to Morrissey and you are wondering which album to buy, start off with this one. You will be happy that you bought it after you experience it.<br />~Note: To All Moz Die-Hards: Editing has been done on \\"Ouija Board\\" {middle cut out}.

B000083C49|4.0|One thing that makes The Voyage Home so watchable is the movie's use of great supporting actors in small roles that add just that extra bit of detail to the Star Trek world. Spock's dignified father has nothing to do with the time-travel storyline, but it's great to see him in the beginning and end of the movie. His aristocratic bearing really adds flair to the early scenes on 23rd century Earth, and his brief reconciliation with Spock in the end is movingly understated. Spock's deferential attitude toward his parents recalls a bygone era, and calls to mind images of strict, lordly military families from the 19th and early 20th centuries.    Saavik also makes a short appearance. Such a shame that the cowards excised Kirk's reference to her \\"condition\\" -- that would have given a more tender and optimistic cast to her farewell. But even as it is, the scene is very affectionate, a good send-off to a unique character in Star Trek (to date, she's the only supporting character that was introduced in the movies, mattered enough to appear in three of them, and still didn't get killed). Spock also gets a warm exchange with his mother -- it's another great touch that she's played by the same actress as in \\"[[ASIN:B000059XU0 Journey To Babel]].\\"    Perhaps the only problem is that these great supporting scenes leave a bit less time for the main plot-line, making the part of the movie set on 20th century Earth feel somewhat rushed. At best, it's very, um, efficient. There are energetic action sequences and comic moments, but it still feels like they don't spend all that much time in San Francisco. Consequently, the feisty marine biologist Gillian Taylor always feels like a bit of a caricature, always childishly over-emotional and \\"in-your-face.\\" The dinner scene would have been a great chance to let her relax and be taken in by Kirk's charisma, but the scene is cut short before their order even arrives.    On the plus side, Kirk's crew gets a chance to shine. Scotty's turn on the computer, in what would have otherwise been a throwaway plot-advancement scene, is hilarious; Doohan easily steals the spotlight, and proves that, even if his character is a goofy stereotype, at least he's an immensely charming stereotype. Chekov gets hurt (yet again, good grief), but the way he plays dumb with his interrogators is funny, and finally inspires viewers to root for him rather than laugh at him. Kirk's single-minded determination to rescue Chekov is very admirable. We all know that the crew loves the captain, but this, finally, demonstrates that the captain is just as unwaveringly loyal to the crew -- not just to Spock, but even to a guy who started out as a one-dimensional comic relief character on the TV show. It also makes one take Chekov a bit more seriously than before.    Unfortunately, McCoy gets left out once more. It is very odd. He was a key character in the TV show, but the movies could never find anything for him to do (even [[ASIN:B00006G8HX Star Trek III]], where he was supposed to be central to the plot). Here, he tags along with Scotty for some reason, and gets the thankless task of playing straight man to Scotty's genial smooth-talker. Finally, in the hospital scene, he gets a chance to make grumpy comments about 20th century medicine, but that's a bit light for a character that ought to be as important as Spock. Kirk and Spock get long scenes in which they wander around San Francisco together, and McCoy should really have been included in those.    The rest of the movie consists of a simplistic, but unobtrusive save-the-whales message. This is really more of a fanciful plot device than anything else, but from a science-fiction viewpoint, the idea of a strange space entity that uses whale-song to communicate deserves points for creativity. The special effects used when the crew travels back in time are kind of pointless, but not bad. The way Kirk looks up at the end, as if waking up from a strange dream, is an effective way of suggesting an out-of-body experience. Shatner is a much better actor than anyone has ever admitted -- he does moments like that quite convincingly.    There's not much else to say. It is a really fun, feel-good movie. The actors are all comfortable in their roles, and that's how the movie feels, comfortable. At this point, the characters aren't really being \\"developed\\" so much as they are becoming the viewers' friends, recognizable icons, cultural archetypes. It helps that every one of those archetypes seems like a very decent human being. In some sense, it kind of inspires one to want to be a better person.
B002ZG98PA|5.0|If you are looking for your fix of a movie to make you smile and feel joyful inside, then this is your movie.  I say this because the movie centers around a beautiful woman named Rapunzel with very long hair, who longs for the day to enjoy the world outside. Her \\"guardian\\" warns her about the risks that abound for her if she goes free, but this only entices her to want to explore the world outside even more. Little does Rapunzel know at first that her \\"guardian\\" actually kidnapped her as a child and is only keeping her in the tower for herself. Rapunzel's life ends up unexpectedly getting changed for the happier when a charming but sensitive inside man comes to hide in her house. He ends up crossing her path after being caught in her house with an important item taken from the palace. They end up going on magical and happy adventures that change both of their lives for the better. Both Rapunzel and her newfound friend end up meeting many other interesting people along the way, and encountering some exciting adventures. This movie is going to make you laugh because I noticed that many other people were laughing at many of the humorous scenes in the movie. As mentioned at the beginning of this review, this movie is a must see if you know that you enjoy happy and uplifting films.
B0000683DH|5.0|There are only two space battles in this film: the brief, vicious exchange of fire when the Enterprise first engages the Reliant, and the more drawn-out sequence in the nebula at the end. Only a few shots are fired in each battle. Most of the time is spent explaining the strategy of the opponents. The pacing in The Wrath Of Khan is masterful. Especially when compared to the horrible [[ASIN:B002HWRYJE new]] Trek film, which contains so many cuts that it is impossible to process what is going on in each shot.    When the starships do fire on each other, a single shot inflicts a lot of damage. This is the only Star Trek film where starships look convincingly dangerous. Later films have a video-game quality in which ships can take many direct hits and still remain more or less fully operational. However, in the short first skirmish of The Wrath Of Khan, both ships are nearly crippled. Because of this, they have to spend the rest of the film warily circling around each other. There is a sense that their captains are thinking hard. Cunning replaces firepower. Of course, this adds to the suspense.    There are also no fist-fights. Kirk and Khan never meet face-to-face. This is perfect. Shatner was already too old here to punch people in the face convincingly anymore. But as a starship captain, he's terrific. During the first encounter with Khan, you can feel that Kirk's mind is racing to try to get ahead of Khan, as Kirk charmingly stalls for time.    Khan himself is the best of all Star Trek villains, and that's a list that includes [[ASIN:B000UJ48T0 Malcolm McDowell]], David Warner, [[ASIN:B00006DEFA F. Murray Abraham]] and Marc Alaimo. Ricardo Montalban adopts an old-fashioned style of acting, with obviously theatrical diction and intonation, as well as aristocratic mannerisms. But, fake though this style may be, it is riveting -- it is the style of [[ASIN:1580495931 Greek tragedy]]. Around the time this film was made, the Star Trek franchise became the only remaining popular outlet for this old-fashioned style, and so Star Trek attracted the style's best actors. In my opinion, that's the best thing about the first six Trek films.    Even aside from Khan's performance, there is a certain old-fashioned strain running through the film -- it is clear that it was written by people who at least knew how to steal from the best. The first half boasts elegant, distinctive writing reminiscent of an older generation of Hollywood films (\\"Prayer, Mr. Saavik -- Klingons don't take prisoners,\\" \\"except, of course, happy birthday, surely the best of times,\\" \\"do you remember the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?\\" and so on). Even the uniforms are sly throwbacks, designed to give just a hint of historical romance, a subliminal association with adventure stories about life on the high seas. No wonder this proved to be Trek's most enduring and popular uniform design.    The subplot with Kirk's midlife crisis is well-drawn. They say that Shatner is a bad actor, but in fact, he is an excellent actor, it's just that he's only capable of playing a single role. But in that one role, he is perfect. Here he poignantly shows his character's feelings of loneliness and regret over the fact that his heroic career caused him to pass up a chance for a normal family life. The film ends on a note of touching optimism; it is shown that, although Kirk will probably never settle down, at least he has a family waiting for him somewhere, similar to Odysseus. (Too bad [[ASIN:B00006G8HX Star Trek III]] trampled all over that message.) Kirk is also given a jolt when his willful negligence of regulations leads to a severe miscalculation that claims the lives of many crew members. His ensuing regret is palpable.    Meanwhile, Spock completes his transformation into a very human, if very reserved figure. His tone in the conversation when he surrenders his command to Kirk -- not what he says, but his voice itself -- reveals how well theyknow each other and how comfortable they are talking together. As for McCoy, he usually doesn't get much to do in Trek films, but he is fairly prominent here. He gets a few good moments with Kirk in the beginning, showing that his friendship with Kirk is just as deep, and maybe closer, than Kirk's friendship with Spock. The conflict gives him a few opportunities (especially on the station) to show his selfless nature and willingness to risk his life to save somebody else.    The minor characters pretty much just do their usual duties (and Chekov gets hurt, yet again), but the original series was never an ensemble show. It's all about the friendship between Kirk, Spock and McCoy. That theme comes through here, although McCoy is a bit too harsh when he snaps at Spock. It would have been fine if they had other scenes together, but they don't. The new character, Saavik, has a small but memorable role, though it becomes more memorable once you've seen her whole character arc through Star Trek IV.    There are other great Star Trek films -- personally, I'd even give a slight edge to [[ASIN:B0000UJL96 Star Trek VI]]. But in terms of pure storytelling, The Wrath Of Khan is brilliant. The phaser beams might look a bit simplistic now, but the film's taut, gripping tension still makes it vastly superior to any present-day special effects extravaganza. And it has some of the most archetypal characters of American culture. It is a film that everyone should see.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I have not read any of the Harry Potter books and so look at each of the films without knowing how they were adapted from page to screen.  As with any adaptation, there will be parts of the story that are changed or removed.  Part one of the final film is quite dark as Voldemort's power dominates the wizarding world. Harry, Ron and Hermione vow to find and destroy all of the Horcruxes in order to kill Voldemort but they have little idea how to accomplish this.     The film follows the battle between the forces of good and evil with evil winning. There are systematic efforts to get rid of wizards that do not agree with Voldemort's notions of pure blood.  Dumbledoor's supports are hunted down.  There are broadcasts where the names of captured or killed wizards are announced. The lack of hope pervades the film as Harry, Ron and Hermione are forced to hide in remote places. The locations chosen for their hiding places were visually stunning.     Daniel Radcliffe turns in a good performance as does Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, who shows a broader range of emotions in this film.  This film centers more on the characters of the three central wizards and they carry off the film very well.  They are supported by a host of British actors that mostly make very brief appearances. Bill Nighly has a brief part as Rufus Scrimgeour, but it is a pivotal one as he provides Harry, Ron and Hermione with items that can help them find the Horcruxes.  Imelda Staunton briefly reprises her role as Dolores Umbridge.  Helena Bonham Carter and Jason Isaacs were, as always, very good being evil.  In addition, Dobby makes a substantial appearance again appearing to help Harry in his time of need. The animation of Dobby (and the elf Kreecher) was much more life like than I recall from previous films.         I did find that the film was a bit slow as Harry, Hermione and Ron hide out trying to discover what to do next.  These scenes added to the tense atmosphere of the film but were too long.  The suggestion was made by one reviewer that the movie is following the book on this point but on screen, it didn't quite work for me.  On the other hand, the scene where polyjuice is used to create multiple Potters is one of the delights of the film and adds a bit of humor to the serious trouble Harry is in.  I thought the animation that told the story of the Deathly Hallows was well done. The music by Alexander Desplait very much added to the mood of the film.
6305127638|3.0|At the very least, First Contact is more watchable than [[ASIN:6305181721 Generations]]. It's also less ambitious. Instead of trying to combine [[ASIN:B001DHXT6G the original series]] with [[ASIN:B000RZIGVS TNG]] while flying through many tear-jerking subplots, First Contact just wants to be an action movie. The action is quite engrossing, with the proper energetic and suspenseful mood.    Sadly, the dialogue leaves much to be desired. Once again, [[ASIN:B0036EH3UC Ronald D. Moore]] heavily relies on vacuous one-liners. Examples: \\"I think it's time we took a little stroll,\\" \\"I believe I speak for everyone when I say, to hell with our orders,\\" \\"Reports of my assimilation have been greatly exaggerated,\\" \\"Assimilate this,\\" \\"Now if you'll excuse me, I have work to do,\\" \\"I will make them pay for what they've done.\\" You can always tell when Moore is writing the script, because whenever someone needs to act gruff, they always start their speech with \\"I want an explanation and I want it now,\\" and end it with \\"Now if you'll excuse me.\\"    The time travel idea was unoriginal by this point, but the bigger problem is that the movie never really shows you 21st century Earth the way that [[ASIN:B000083C49 The Voyage Home]] showed 20th century Earth. All you ever see on the planet surface is that one grimy camp in the woods. The Earth dwellers listen to 1950s rock and roll, which is really lazy characterization, because no one does that even now. On the other hand, I liked James Cromwell as Zefram Cochrane. The movie does a pretty good job of showing his reluctance to be a hero, without taking the focus off the action. Cochrane contributes most of the light-hearted moments, and really redeems the parts of the movie set on Earth.    Alfre Woodard's character, however, is out of place. She's supposed to form some kind of bond with Picard. This is an action movie, meaning they can't have a romance, so I guess they're supposed to become good friends or something. But they are really badly matched. Picard is an educated, brooding intellectual, and Woodard plays a hard, scrappy, inarticulate fighter. They have no chemistry, it makes no sense that Picard would listen to this person that he just met and not to his senior staff. Plus, I always have trouble believing that people could start by pointing guns at each other and making death threats, and then quickly go on to form a deep friendship. I think it's a cheap exaggeration (and, in Moore's Battlestar Galactica, it happens in every single episode).    The movie is centered around Picard and his memories of his horrific [[ASIN:B000CCBCIA experience]] with the Borg. Well, give them credit for using a plot detail that is actually related to the show. Patrick Stewart shows Picard's anguish very well, you can really believe that this experience left him deeply wounded.    As for Data...well, at least he doesn't embarrass himself like in Generations. Clearly, Moore realized that giving Data emotions in Generations was a really dumb idea, because Data now has the ability to deactivate his emotions at will, meaning that you never hear about them throughout most of the film. But, since he still has access to them, the movie now needs to come up with a completely new way to make him yearn to be human. This time, it has to do with Data's lack of skin and tactile sensation. It's clever, but doesn't tug at the ol' heartstrings in the same way. Oh well.    The rest of the crew gets short shrift. Riker and Geordi spend most of their time hanging out with Cochrane down on the planet, where Cochrane has most of the spotlight. Troi and Dr. Crusher do absolutely nothing. Worf is at least tough, so he gets to come along on a dangerous mission and shoot some enemies. Also, because he's an impulsive Klingon, there just has to be one scene where he flies into a passion and threatens to kill Picard, the man he respects more than anyone else. Why, why must Ronald D. Moore always turn all the emotions up to eleven?    Asvillains, the Borg are scary but faceless (well, that's the point). The movie has a few great \\"gotcha\\" moments when the Borg are starting to infest the Enterprise, and later as the crew tries to fight their relentless advance. But the producers wanted someone with more personality, who could hold an audience the way villains like Khan did, so now the Borg turn out to have a sultry Borg Queen who is capable of individuality. This makes the Borg less interesting as an idea -- the reason why they were so shocking in the show was because they were so different from humans as to be incomprehensible. But, I have to say that Alice Krige, as the Queen, is not bad. In her own way, she does hold the audience.    TNG doesn't translate to film as well as the original series, because it's more of an ensemble show, it's not meant to focus on the captain this much. First Contact, unfortunately, doesn't know what to do with most of the crew, and interprets TNG as the Picard and Data show. But it also introduces some pointless new characters, who use up screen time that could have been used for somebody who had more character development from the series. Still, it works as a Picard story as well as an action flick. And, of course, it's a million times better than [[ASIN:B00005JLRT Nemesis]].
B0000399WC|5.0|this purchase was a gift for a friend -- it was shipped directly to him.  he enjoyed the dvd and commented on how quickly it arrived after i told him to watch for it in the mail.  i have made purchases from this seller in the past and will do so again if the items i want are in their stock.  overall, we were both very happy with this purchase.
B00005JLRT|1.0|What I really dislike about Nemesis is the way it bungles the Romulans. You see, by the time this movie came out, the Romulans were the last credible villains left in the entire Star Trek universe. The Klingons, for example, haven't been interesting since [[ASIN:B0000UJL96 Star Trek VI]]. After that, they were reduced to medievalist caricatures. There was no way anyone could take their archaic capering as a serious alternative to a modern society -- and, in fact, their society and technology came to be constantly depicted as falling apart at the seams, until it was no longer even plausible that they were somehow still a major power. Even a patriot like Worf had to eventually admit his people's total ineptitude.    Who else was there? The Borg already appeared in [[ASIN:6305127638 First Contact]], and besides, they've been played out. They're one-dimensional zombies who attack people in the dark, not exactly a cerebral challenge. Same for the [[ASIN:B00062RCC6 Dominion]], who never amounted to more than a bunch of comic-book supervillains. Nobody would ever willingly support them, their own soldiers and diplomats only did it because they were genetically engineered.    The Cardassians were a worthy enemy: ruthless, but also intelligent and charismatic, in a modern way. Their cruelty was a conscious, informed choice, which they could eloquently defend. They were fierce nationalists, but they loved their families as much as their ideology. But, of course, because [[ASIN:B0036EH3UC Ronald D. Moore]] had to prove that the Federation is the only true way, they ended up being almost totally annihilated and occupied at the end of Deep Space Nine. So they're out.    That leaves the Romulans as the only antagonists with a credible, modern alternative to the Federation. They were always in the shadows, but it seemed that they had a kind of authoritarian republic, ruled by a Senate. Their militarism had an egalitarian streak, with women holding high positions. The Federation was sufficiently intimidated by them to put an embargo on their consumer goods. They had potential.    But here, it turns out that their economy is based on slavery, another dull medievalist throwback. Disappointing, for a race that was always more about subterfuge than brute force. The slaves revolt and assassinate the entire Senate, which ends up being about ten guys in a small room. Come on, the Roman Senate in \\"[[ASIN:B000BZISSU Cleopatra]]\\" looked more impressive than that.    Then, bizarrely, the rest of the movie is about how the slaves are worse than the masters. The Remans are these hideous, ghoulish bat-demon guys with sepulchral voices, as opposed to the prim, efficient Romulans. They can't organize themselves, so their leader is a non-Reman. This leader turns out to be a megalomaniac who wants to...destroy planet Earth. Oh man.    Obviously, the movie is copying [[ASIN:B0000683DH The Wrath Of Khan]] with the personal vendetta thing. But Khan's hatred of Kirk was actually derived from the series, not incompetently invented on the spot. Furthermore, the original series was better suited to that kind of story, because it revolved around Kirk's epic personality more than anything else. But Picard is an intellectual, meant for modern, complex political interaction. A story that really focused on sneaky Romulans would have been perfect. They could have brought back Sela, who could have taken on Picard in a more plausible battle of wits instead of trying to blow up Earth.    Anyway, when Picard defeats a Reman ship, he tells the Romulans that the Federation won't interfere in their internal affairs. Hilariously, the movie first makes the Romulans into grotesque slave-owners, and then ends up defending this practice! I would compliment the writers on their admirably principled non-interventionist stance, but I doubt they understood their own message, if they had one.    The long scene on the desert planet is totally unnecessary. The part about B4 could have been wrapped up with a simple away team mission, or better yet, written out of the plot entirely because of its inanity. But no, we get a car chase involving space trucks. Apparently the director is so fond of truck racing that he was intent on putting it in at any cost -- no matter that the scene makes no sense, shows Picard blatantly violating Federation law for absolutely no reason, and looks really dumb.    And a lot of the action is limp. The Enterprise is fighting a super-intense space battle against the Remans, a Reman assault team has boarded the ship, but during this crisis the first officer of the Enterprise is off crawling through ducts chasing one guy (apparently the security system is incapable of trapping him). The sole reason for this is so he can be shown kicking the guy into oblivion, exactly like Kirk in [[ASIN:B00006G8HX Star Trek III]], not the high point of that film to begin with.    Basically, Nemesis is a complete waste of time. It was the worst of all the Star Trek movies, until they made [[ASIN:B002HWRYJE another one]] that's even worse. Sorry, Gene -- it was good while it lasted.
B0000DD79B|5.0|Greatest songwriter of all time.  Could listen to this CD everyday the rest of my life.  Wish they were still making music but nothing great lasts forever.
B0000UJL96|5.0|The Klingons were always the number-one villains of Star Trek, but this movie is the only time they were really interesting. From [[ASIN:B000RZIGVS TNG]] onward, they turned into caricatures of medieval Vikings or Mongols, with a stereotypical warrior culture, and it became impossible to take them seriously as a galactic superpower. They fought with swords in the 24th century, for crying out loud.    But in The Undiscovered Country, they are modern and formidable. They are radically different from humans, but their society is a functional alternative to the Federation. Maybe not a good alternative, but an alternative, not a cartoon. This is best exemplified by the character of General Chang, the main villain of the film and arguably the best of all Star Trek villains (and there's a lot of competition there).    Chang is a highly educated man. He is well-acquainted with the works of [[ASIN:B000WCWVDA Shakespeare]], and actually appreciates them, whereas no human in this film knows anything about Klingon culture (not even their language, as we see in one scene). In other words, he carefully studies and respects his enemies. As befits an imperial officer, he has an aristocratic bearing. He often uses medievalist words like \\"warrior,\\" but that is clearly a show. His voice reveals his ironic enjoyment of theatrics; he's a refined man self-consciously playing up a barbarian image. His villainy is the product of a conscious decision that makes sense from his point of view; he's not just some unreasoning maniac, he's a lot more dangerous.    The Klingon leader, Gorkon, is the typical \\"pro-reform candidate\\" you see on TV, the Good Foreigner: idealistic, going against the opinions of his advisors and probably the general Klingon public as well. But he is assassinated early in the film, and succeeded by his daughter, a very different person. She is much more cautious and distrustful than her father, full of nationalist pride and keenly aware of national interests. She also believes in the necessity of reforms, and also goes against the hard-liners, but she will make sure that any eventual agreement is fair to her side.    At the same time, it also turns out that the conspiracy to disrupt the peace agreement involves Federation officers as well. The Federation has its own paranoid nationalists, who only want to humiliate and conquer the other side (which they view as \\"the alien trash of the galaxy\\"). If [[ASIN:B0036EH3UC Ronald D. Moore]] had written the script, he would have tried to justify them. Fortunately, he did not write it, and the Enterprise crew takes a firmer moral stand; all the conspirators, human and Klingon, are unequivocally treated as villains. The writers deserve great credit -- they first create a morally ambiguous setting, and then still argue in favour of doing the right thing, instead of making ends-justify-the-means excuses. Gene Roddenberry allegedly disliked the film (he saw it shortly before his death), but I think it upholds the spirit of his vision better than any other Star Trek film.    There is a wealth of fine actors in the film. Mark Lenard isn't strictly necessary to the plot, but it's great to see Sarek in his diplomatic role, it makes the film just that little bit better. The other ambassadors, the Federation people (Brock Peters and [[ASIN:B00062RCC6 Rene Auberjonois]]), and [[ASIN:6305350205 David Warner]] as Gorkon are all great, as well. Kim Cattrall is excellent as the icy, reserved Valeris.    The regular crew also performs very well. The scenes aboard the Enterprise in the middle of the film make up a splendidly suspenseful detective story, as the crew urgently tries to piece together what happened, while Spock's unshakable composure holds them together. Shatner gives a great performance; when Kirk slowly comes to realize his prejudice against Klingons, you can see that it doesn't come easy, it requires a lot of gradual thought and effort from him. George Takei has a small part, but it is touching to see how Sulu risks the displeasure of his superiors just to help his old captain -- the theme of friendship was always the best aspect of the original series. Spock is at his all-time most human here; he's still impassive and collected, but he's moved far beyond his self-parodic obsession with logic. Here, he's kind of like Athos from [[ASIN:B003WE9ZRU The Three Musketeers]], compared to Kirk's cunning d'Artagnan.    If the film has a weakness, it's that McCoy doesn't get a lot to do. Somehow, the movies were never really able to fit him in well. Here, he gets a couple of great scenes when he desperately tries to save Gorkon, and then later at the trial. But after that, he's pretty much just there for the ride. Kirk does all the work of coming up with the escape plan. I think the writers made him go to the torpedo bay with Spock just to give him something to do. But, you know, he's a doctor, not an engineer. It feels awkward.    This is easily the most complex of all the Star Trek films, with the best portrayal of an alien culture. It is thought-provoking and brooding -- even the soundtrack helps to set the paranoid feel of the conspiracy. It should have been the last outing of the original crew. Unfortunately, commercial considerations prevailed, and Kirk was ignobly dealt with in the awful [[ASIN:6305181721 Generations]]. But in The Undiscovered Country, the crew goes out on the high point of the entire franchise.
B004132HZS|5.0|I was expecting to see just another jab at the Sherlock Holmes tale but this is a totally new imagining of Sherlock in modern day setting.  The actors are first rate and fun to watch.  Sherlock has always been played as being eccentric but this show has him pretty much one step ahead of an institution. Sherlock is a maddening genius. I love the way they changed the 7% solution into nicotine patches--brilliant.  The Dr. Watson character is more complex than before and is really interesting.  This new approach to a well-loved story is satisfying and delicious.  The only thing I can complain about is how all shows shot in Britain are so dark--sometimes it is hard to make out the action.  Perhaps it adds to the mood but I would love to send them at least another 100 watt bulb to illuminate the set.  Try it.  You'll love it.

B0044KU7KU|5.0|Once again My Chemical Romance release a beautiful work of art. It's original it's catchy, and most of all it makes you want to rock out and dance. I have been a fan of everything My Chemical Romance has ever released. Never once have I been dissapointed by them. Up until now I had thought that Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge was the best, followed by I Brought You My Bullets You Brought Me Your Love, and then The Black Parade. However, my opinion drastically changed after the first listen to Danger Days. This album is their greatest and most inspiring work of art they have dished out. I realise some people will try to put the album down with crap excuses such as \\"MCR are sell outs now\\" But honestly face the fact, My Chemical Romance have never been sell outs, they aren't doing it for the money, it's all for the sake of rock and expression. I have long admired the band members and their ways of thinking. But anyways, This album is nothing like their previous records. But then again, none of their albums are the same. This album takes a new approach to rock for the band, and they not only grasps the elements infused with the record but they run with them and make it their own. The concept is beautiful and creative, leaving fans in a world created by music; a world that is believable and so close that you can close your eyes and fall into it. The lyrics are amazing and while following the same signature style of the band, they stick out from previous songs. Each song is an adventure for listeners. Not one song is the same as the next and yet they all seem to fit into the concept and album very well. Synths and electronic elements add to the beauty of the guitar and bass blend. Ray Toro's voice almost feels like it is part of Gerard's and the harmony created between the two voices sends shivers down your spine during many songs. Unforgettable tunes are heard through the entire album and there are many beautiful guitar solos that will shock and awe you. Words can't really accurately describe the beauty of this album. Great job MCR. Every single  one of you just keep on amazing me.

Die Fallen sind besser und die 3d effekte sind AUCH SUPER. Dr.Gorden ist jetzt der Nachfolger. Das verspricht viel Spannung und Vorfreude auf weitere Teile! Ich kenne keinen vergleichbaren Horrorfilm mit einer so extrem guten Story und Qualität. ES ist der beste Kino-Film, den ich das ganze Jahr 2010 gesehen habe. kann ich nur weiterempfehlen( aber nichts für schwache Nerven!)  LG
B003YFIUW8|1.0|\\"ME NOT LIKE BOOK\\".  maybe thats how a 5 year old would say it....please.  I couldnt wait to get this book over with and i'm so sorry i wasted my money on it.  The book was so \\"on the surface\\".  The only thing i liked about this book was the last page...because that meant THAT I WAS DONE.  uggghhhh.
0385504225|2.0|Someone recommended this book to me because I live in DC, thinking I would enjoy the way the setting was worked into the story. Instead, I found myself growing progressively more irritated by the sloppy references to local geography that began in the first chapter and kept popping up throughout the book. (The Masonic Temple on 16th & S is \\"just blocks\\" from the Capitol, but walking there from 1st Street is apparently a very long distance... um, what?) Suffice it to say, Langdon's little comment in the story about how most Americans never visit their capital city sounds like Brown hoping it's true so people won't notice how badly he's mangled the descriptions of this region and its citizens.<br /><br />Aside from that, this book reads like it's written by a teenager who keeps waiting for someone to applaud him for being clever every time a plot twist arises. The characters are flat. The setting is almost irrelevant to the plot--other reviewers have already pointed out the formulaic way this story reads when compared against Brown's earlier works. The story also reads like it's waiting to be turned into a movie. And it jerks you around only to lead to an utterly unsatisfying conclusion that, in more skilled hands, could have been much more thought-provoking, and *should* have been the heart of the story.<br /><br />Aside from that, it's a quick read and will keep you busy if you have time to kill, but it's ultimately nothing special.
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|The best so far of all the Twilight Saga movies.  Twilight was great, New Moon was terrible, and Eclipse was amazing!! Congrats to David Slade for being so good at his craft!  Okay Bill Condon.... Please don't disappoint us!
B000VLOKQI|5.0|As expected, this is a wonderful DVD box set that captures The Who over the years by examining their music, personalities, interaction with each other, and the recollections from people who knew them from the 1960s to the present.  Well done.<br /><br />Randall Ponder, Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
0061537969|5.0|Whatever possessed me to buy The Art of Racing in the Rain, I don't know.  I'm not particularly a fan of dogs and I had never even heard of the book, but something told me to get it, and am I glad that I did.  This is a very entertaining book that I could hardly put down once I started it.  I love reading purely for pleasure and then having the added benefit of learning about something that I might never have encountered otherwise, and this book provided that with its factual, but not overbearing, information regarding car racing.  Written in the voice of the dog, Enzo, there is a certain innocense and simplicity in his thoughts, yet there is humor, drama, and deep emotion.  I began to mentally compare Enzo to Old Yeller.  It's one book that I might read a second time.
0316017922|5.0|Mr. Gladwell hits a home run with this book, as well-described by other reviewers.  Its nine chapters cover a lot of areas, though in sum, it all leads back to his insightful thoughts on explaining what makes individuals successful.  This is an outstanding book.      Randall Ponder, Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
1416583432|1.0|She tries to sell this idea that we are totally misinterpreting dogs (kind of \\"after this book you will really know your dog and he will really love you\\".     For example, if you put a sweater on a dog the dogs feels to have something on top of him. Since he only has something on top of him is when another dog is making him be submissive, then the sweater makes the dog feel submissive. No scientific evidence of this, just a few things that popped into her head and which, she wants to informs us , considers the NEW TRUTH about dogs.    This lady talks  about her dog all along the book (well, as far as I got). That makes a lot of the book inductive and not deductive and when you analize behavior you have to be deductive. She writes in this superficial style where she wiggles around an idea that could be presented in one page, but then she would't have a book. This is the style that also repeats things over and over and over.    If you are used to scientific reading and straight to the point and rich ideas, you'll be jumpingnervouslyy n your chair after the first 50 pages.     Look at some examples of those ideas that just pop out of her head to iluminate us all:     \\"Dogs hate dog beds because to them every flat place in the house is the same\\". Just her thoughts. No scientific evidencee whatsoever.     \\"Dogs are not pack animals,  only wolves are; dogs don't care nor pay attention to hierarchies\\". Yeah right!    \\"The tactic of showing a  dog his feces and punishing him when he has made them inside the house is veryi neffectivee. Food as a reward is better than punishment which only creates resentment\\". Sure, try watching a dog for four hours to give him a cookie when he defecates outside!  Try restraining the food from the guilty dog for two hours after the crime and see how he will never associate the two things! People have been using the show and punish technique since theEgyptianss because it works. I've been around animals all my life and this book defies commonsense!    I wish I had read my own review before buying several of these books as Xmas presents. Now I'll have to find the time to take them back.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|If you want the music makers that made 40-50 years of history in music, and wrote memorable  music for other artists, you must own this ONE* and another titled \\"This is where I came in*\\". I looked all over for their (beegees)\\"collectors edition\\", could not find it at a decent price, so decided to purchase the same music & message through these* two different packages. Bought another set as a gift.  Great sound through our BruRay & surround sound system. Excellent quality all around.
B001ECQ4AS|5.0|Supernatural season 1 builds up all the back story you need to fully enjoy the later seasons.<br /><br />While some of the episodes are hit or miss, the season is still very suspenseful, mysterious, and full of horror-iffic goodness. The characters are the real draw to keep watching; Jensen Ackles as Dean, Jared Padalecki as Sam, occasional guest appearances by Jeffrey Dean Morgan as their father John, and of course, a '67 Chevy Impala as the lovely Metallicar.<br /><br />As for the technical side of the product, the blu-ray disk set contains the same extras that the regular DVD set does. It's just prettier.<br /><br />Start watching immediately and get hooked on the best horror/drama being produced today!
B000MNP2K8|1.0|Very odd, this is in a lightning deal (after Thanksgiving) and MORE people are picking the Full-Screen over the Widescreen.    This means the picture is getting CROPPED and your not seeing the whole picture. People your tube Tvs are going to die soon and you will have no choice but to upgrade to a new widescreen TV, I advise you to buy the WIDESCREEN edition (you can always zoom in IF there are any black). bars.
6304602944|5.0|A nice buddy-cop movie about two officers who are falsely accused of murdering an undercover agent. As the pieces fall together they catch the real guys who committed the murder.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|It would be great if CBS video would allow downloads of individual episodes on iTunes or on their website. On the ABC TV network you can watch TV shows for free on their website.
B001RL4K1Q|4.0|Really good movie, but this bluray edition lacked features and menus.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I would strongly recommend Josh Groban's new CD Illuminations.    Be warned it has some new sounds and instrumentation that is more unique than some of his other repertoire, but it has been a great experiment. If you want a sample of one of the new songs, check out \\"Bells of New York City.\\"    Overall, the CD is amazing, and I have had it play multiple times during studying and relaxing.
0671646788|5.0|If there is one book I would recommend for self help it would be this one.  I say this after reading a lot of self help literature. Its no airy fairy stuff but full of practical ideas. And as generally happens in reading self help you feel good after reading.  If you want to feel good and there are many books to choose from pick this one up and it works magic.Whenever there is self doubt, fear of failure or anxiety about future I turn to this book.Make sure to make notes or mark down important ideas or just read the summary at the end of each chapter.
1607050072|5.0|This book is a MUST have in your book shelves.  There are 21 great projects which are totally do-able for beginners and more experienced sewists alike.  Some of the projects look simple but it is all the little details that make them so unique.  This book teaches you all sorts of things.  How to mix and match fabrics, how to have fun with your freehand quilting, what projects to make while you practice....  And the photos are just gorgeous. But I think what I love most is how Kajsa teaches you to take snippets of your life as inspiration for your craft.
B000001FDQ|5.0|If I were LOST on a Desert Island, this CD would be one of my 3 that I'd have to have with me.  I bought this album (yes, those black plastic circular platters with the small hole in the middle) back in about 1985.  The release was also one of the first CD's I bought when they started becoming available. I've got to tell you from the first play, I knew I had something special.  I can (& do) listen to this release regularly (even after 25ish years) and still enjoy it immensely.  I'm glad that more than one review mentions Jeff Scott Soto--he's an animal when it comes to vocals--though he doesn't really get to show off on this release.  BUY THIS!  OWN THIS!  LOVE THIS!!
044656740X|5.0|I was extremely satisfied with this book.  If I had been taught these concepts as a child I would probably be rich now.  But, hey, there's still time.  This is a book I plan to reread many times on my journey to financial freedom.  I wholeheartedly recommend \\"Rick Dad, Poor Dad\\" for anyone wanting to change their financial lot in life.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Performance of this little flash amazes me. I paired this flash with my D7000 to shoot events and parties the results are great not any different then my SB600/800.
0060763280|4.0|Excellent information on how the money game is more mental than anything.  It's helped me realize that being rich is more of a mental process than anything else, and it's helping me get on the right path mentally.  However, it is totally off-base when it comes to its statements on spiritual matters (I know it's not a spiritual book, per se, but it gets into some spiritual matters).      First, the author is very new age and even advocates praying to the universe (which they do in the seminar).  The universe is just a collection of inanimate objects.  It does not have a will.  it will not send you money (or anything else, for that matter, to you).  It cannot hear you.  And it cannot answer your prayers.  If you want to pray, pray to God Almighty, in the name of his son Jesus Christ.  He can hear you.  Second, he states that \\"It's better to give than to receive\\" is \\"a crock!\\" and \\"total hotgwash\\", and that \\"Whoever decided that it is better to give than to receive was simply bad at math.\\"  Well, that \\"Whoever\\" is Jesus Christ.  And even if you don't believe in Him as the Son of God (as I do), most people realize that he was a very wise man (I beleive that to be the ultimate understatement).  The author states that giving and receiving are basically equal because they are just two sides of the same, and that one cannot give if their is no one to receive, so they are equally important.  However, the whole process of giving and receiving can only be started by giving, not by receiving (Trying to receive without being given is called stealing), thereby making giving better than receiving.    In summary, The author makes some very good points on the importance of having the right mindset in order to create and retain wealth, but he also makes spiritual statements which do not concur with the Bible, the ultimate instruction book.  So I suggest you retain the good information and reject the bad.
B003PIUC02|5.0|This was a different type of series than I'm use to watching, it's a mix of 300 and gladiator.  The special effects aren't of the greatest quality, but the story line is amazing.  This show is definitely not for kids.  Lots of blood and nudity scenes.  You won't be disappointed with this show, especially if you watch it on Blu-Ray.
B001G8XON0|5.0|Great movie and great Blu-Ray. Just to let you know if you are a international customer like me, this release works in Region B and it has subtitles in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish.
0061537969|5.0|Baqgar Vance, known for his approach to golf and life skills, created a philosophy where the game of golf can teach one about life. Now there is a new philosopher in town and it is Enzo, a mixed breed dog, who lives with a race car driver and knows that when he is re-incarnated next, he will come back as a human.<br /><br />A vital member of his family unit, composed of Denny, the driver, Eve, the wife, and Zoe, the daughter, Enzo leads the reader in a story from his perspective mixing in a philosophy of life explained in racing terms akin to the method employed by Baggar Vance.<br /><br />Enzo's role and approach is gentler than Baggar's as he relates the ups and down, the triumphs and tragedy, of the family unit.<br /><br />Once you start this book, it going to be hard to put it down.
0316098337|5.0|I just stumbled across Room on a book of the month list and thankfully looked it up.  This book was amazing.  Once you get used to the 5 year old narrative, it just draws you in and doesn't let you go until the end.  I read the first chapter for free on a site and then hurriedly bought the ebook.  My co worker probably thought me to be insane at times, pulling my laptop screen closer and gripping its sides during some parts of the book.  The book was so powerful I cried at the end.<br />Emma Donoghue does a fantastic job of pulling you into the book and weaving these characters to life for you.  I fell in love with them both and couldn't put this book away until it was done. Thank you for some of the best 3 hour stretches of my life. There were highs and lows and suspense and love.  Not your typical read but well worth it.  I enjoyed it so much I'm heading straight to her other books.<br />Try Room- you won't be disappointed.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I am brand new to Halo, and don`t play video games, so i was not sure about this book. I had a long trip ahead of me and wanted to stay awake. The 6 hour drive flew by I am addicted. WhileI still won't play the game I will get the rest in th series.If you like fast action, hard science fiction, and charactors you care about get this book. I got the audiobook and the narrator does a great job and really draws you into the action.
0439023513|5.0|This last book is an amazing end to the Hunger Games trilogy. I absolutely couldn't put it down. I can definitely see the anti-war propaganda in it, showing human's capacity for violence and destruction. But it also is a great story of humans' capacity to move on, to live with the terror that dogs our every step. For Katniss and Peeta, while it may not be a happy ending, they find a way to move beyond their nightmares and live their lives as much as possible after everything that has happened. And I think that's the most important point.
B004BSAEQC|1.0|After all the hype and virtual beef I just knew she was going to spit fire.  Sadly, it was all smoke and mirrors because this was the worse $11 I spent.  The best part of the album is when someone else is on the track, possibly the hook, and when she's quiet.  I don't like how she repeatedly goes over the same rhymes and makes noises.  I also don't like how it appears she chose random words that rhymed but had no substance behind it.  If THIS is what we have to look forward to hip hop is really dead and I hope someone -beside Nicki- can breathe life back into the genre.<br />She adorable, her brand is dope, but lyrically she's a tragedy.  What happen to the rap game?
B004BC7MRM|3.0|Kid Rock has talent. Kid Rock needs to pick a genre and stick with it. He is so torn between being a wanna be Lynyrd Skynyrd type band (not a bad choice if its the original Skynyrd lineup you are trying to emulate), a Hank Williams Jr. wanna be, or a Detroit rock/rapper. Pick a genre and stick with it! Its an ok album, but nothing I wanna crank up in the car, ya know?
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Legend of the Seeker<br />Season One<br /><br />This is the TV version of the wildly popular fantasy series \\"Sword of Truth\\" from Terry Goodkind.<br /><br />Though the TV series does actually bring many of the elements from the books into the limelight, one familiar with the book series will still be able to watch the series without having the general feel of \\"been there, done that\\" that many Book-to-TV series or movies tend to inspire.<br /><br />Filmed in some of the most beautiful locations on Earth (very similar and sometimes the same locations used in the Lord of the Rings movies) it is easy to become entranced with the classic good-vs-evil struggle the main characters engage in on a day to day basis.  However, unlike many other fantasy dramas, each episode isn't only about the single minded goal of beating the bad guy or winning the day, in each episode the main characters will take the time out of their main quest to engage in assistance with common every day people and their problems while moving forward to build the reputation and support for the main character, the Seeker or Richard Cypher.<br /><br />The casting in Legend of the Seeker follows through with the choice of locations, perfect for the series.  Craig Horner's version of Richard Cypher had me thinking back to the book series each time I saw him realizing just how close to the image I had in my own mind he was.  Bridget Regan's casting as Kahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor, was probably the one area where I was the most concerned before watching the series.  Someone I had little to no experience with, Bridget came out and truly became the Mother Confessor in the first season.  Moving her from the hardened, single minded person that she was before meeting the Seeker to a caring, amazing, loving character by the end of the first season WITHOUT becoming the 'love struck schoolgirl' that directors tend to make heroines over time.<br /><br />Over all, any fantasy or sci-fi lover can not go wrong with Legend of the Seeker, the First Season helps set up the location and the characters in a way rarely done in TV...well.  Taking the time to establish characters we know, love, and can relate to combined with good plot writing and amazing visuals make this a wonderful experience for the entire family.Legend of the Seeker, the First Season helps set up the location and the characters in a way rarely done in TV...well.

0307474712|1.0|One Day has been super hyped for months and is going to be a film I hear. After slogging through this book for the past few months, I can say that I will not be wasting time on the movie version. Sorry, but I can't stand plots that are so contrived: two people spend twenty years realizing they need each other. The only person Dexter needed was Dexter. The female protagonist, Emma, is no better spending two decades moping about Dexter. Neither is realistic and both need to seriously grow up and move on.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|I have always enjoyed the 80's style action flick - realistic fight scenes (no \\"wire-fu\\"), car chases, explositions, etc.  This movie delivers all of that along with the stars of the time and some new ones too!
B003OCWF6I|3.0|********SPOILER ALERT***********    --This review may contain Spoilers pertaining to the Losers, The A-Team and The Secret Window.--        I enjoyed this movie, it's comedic level did make me laugh or chuckle at times. It was entertaining, definitely watchable. Most of the characters were good, if half fleshed- which I think is ok for an action comedy like this.      However, there are some really huge problems I had with it.     1. The plot is extraordinarily predictable. I suck at predicting movie plots. I didn't get that Mort was a schizophrenic in The Secret Window until the last scene where he starts talking to himself.      So when I predicted the entire plot of The Losers within the first 6 minutes, you know its predictable.      2. The bad guy totally walked away unscathed in the end. How badass can this team really be if they don't even get the bad guy?    3. Unoriginal.     It's a very similar plot as the A-Team, which was and AMAZING movie in my opinion. The Losers was almost like a severely more predictable, not-as-good ripoff of The A-Team. So, If you find yourself in front of your local Redbox, I would suggest picking The A-Team over The Losers, but if your just looking for a flick, the Losers will do the trick.     :)
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|Excellent follow up album to Demon Days. I thought it was amazing after only listening through it the once but now after dozens of times playing the album I can only say that in my view, its fantastic. A must buy album!
B004B4J7H8|5.0|The fact that this film is divided into two is a huge challenge for all who worked on the film, I'm sure. But I greatly believe that Part 1 was handled extremely well; what many people don't realize is that, despite this fact that this film is being shown in two parts, it truly is one film. No one goes out of the way to set up the next film of finish the first because that's how it is in the books. As such, creating music for only one part of a film, nevertheless the first part where there is no major conflict resolution, must have been a great challenge. I for one am glad that John Williams didn't work on the fifth, sixth, and seventh films - I would have ruined the dark tone that was slowly beginning in the third, John Williams last.     Another challenge that I think Desplat overcomes greatly is the fact that much of this film is psychological and introspective: Harry thinking about Hallows/Horcruxes, Hermione keeping a straight face after losing the support of her parents, and Ron just trying to stick it out, hoping for the best. Desplat's music successfully creates music that accompanies the spontaneous nature of thought with melodies that are never fully resolved while some just keep repeating, wondering.     Overall, moments of this films are highlighted with Desplat's work while other moments remain somewhat purposefully opaque. I always enjoy every HP soundtrack just because it is HP, but the music in the fifth, sixth, and especially the seventh adaptations have made the movie experience all the more cathartic.

B0043A0PXU|2.0|Time has not been kind to Annie Lennox's voice.  What was once considered a great strength, is now the problem with this CD -- her voice is so grating it makes every song painful to hear.  You would think they could have done something with the production to make it more palatable, but for whatever reason they did not.  And too bad, because the it's a nice collection of songs with interesting arrangements (plus she writes a nice intro about the meaning of religion), but her voice makes it all unlistenable to me.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|After stumbling upon \\"The Corrections\\" a few years ago, I was pleased to see Franzen back at working mining the American gestalt.  While not as rich as Corrections, \\"Freedom\\" is a fine read.  Odd to see the polarized reviews here, but I guess you either love Franzen or hate him.<br /><br />Supposedly, the author took years to write this, and locked himself in his office, purposely disconnected from the internet (hard to believe, considering all the details he gets into).  Franzen does a great job of richly documenting the three past decades of Americana through the lives of his complex characters.  He touches on everything -- 80's new wave music, the recent Iraq War, you name it, and he writes about it.  A fine book!

B002ZG98Z0|5.0|My wife and recently watched the whole series recently and feel that this movie was a great finale to it all. It wasn't too serious but it gave good closure to the story. It was very fun to watch as well.
B001E45XT4|4.0|One of the first things I noticed after these arrived the other day: They're HUGE! This is something I do very much enjoy about them because they fit very nicely and easily around your ears. Perhaps my two most favorite things about them: The pads on these cans are plush instead of PVC. SO much better both for comfort and for the fact that I can wear them for hours without them making my ears sweat (you know you hate ear sweat). Also, the boom mic which folds into the headband. EVERYONE should make them this way. I love that if I wanted to take them around hooked up to my Cowon I can do so without having them look like a computer headset.  The construction seems pretty solid and the plastics are of good quality. Almost like a \\"rubbermaid\\" sort of plastic; flexible and firm, but not rigid. The fit is very nice and snug, don't listen to the others who said these were painful to wear, it's a load of rubbish and they must either have watermelon sized heads or are wearing them wrong somehow.  They are closed ear but open air, also, meaning they're not meant to block outside noise. This I actually prefer since I can easily turn down the volume to hear someone talking to me without having to take them off and put them on again.  Sound is perfectly acceptable. The lows do in fact sound nice and low (though I've heard better, admittedly), and it has excellent and crisp highs. I haven't actually gotten much gaming done with them, but they seem clear enough to easily make out directional sounds without an issue. The Mic also sounds great, nice and clear from what I could tell through Skype's call testing service.  The cord is also nice and thick, hopefully that's more wire and less insulation, to help alleviate shorts in it.  All in all as long as these last for a good long time (as plantronics is known for) I'll be very satisfied. Definitely would buy again if they stay at $25.

0975991477|5.0|Dr Lipton is a very credible \\"scientist\\" who explains how are cells are like little individuals (like we are small individuals on a planet that is  small individual that helps make up a galaxy, etc. etc,) and think and function (there are 50-75 trillion cells making up our bodies) and somehow not only consciously work but mostly choose to do it cooperatively.  I studied cell biology in dental school back in the 1900s and never had presented the concepts of cell biology as Dr Lipton does, let alone the effects  of consciousness on the way cells perceive the world and either work well or act dysfunctionally.  This is VERY  IMPORTANT BOOK!!
1934030554|4.0|\\"You can only change what you can measure\\" is one of the basic principles in the CycleOps indoor power cycling instructor course. I read \\"Training and racing with a power meter\\" in preparation for my course. It clearly describes how to measure what you do, how to analyse the data assesing you current fitness, and how to plan and perform the right training at the right time. Using a powermeter and reading this book lifted my own training and the classes I lead as an instructor and coach to a next level.

B0021L8V0M|4.0|Angelina Jolie has become a female version of Jason Bourne.  She keeps my adrenaline levels at their peak and made me constantly guessing which side she was on.  This whole movie is like the Bourne Supremacy meets Mission Impossible.  A great combination between presidential assassination, secret agents, and the verge of World War III.  With a combination that intense, this movie is expected to be an instant classic.

B002ZG99N6|3.0|This was without a doubt the best action film Ben Affleck has done since Pearl Harbor.  However, there was too much shooting and the script had somewhat poor editing, resulting in some irregularities in the plot.  Pearl Harbor was much the same way.  Both films had too much action and not enough plot to make them a sensible story.  Ben Affleck was a great actor in this film and I liked the complex relationship his character had with his brother.  Also, when they planned their biggest heist, I was nervous that they might get caught.  Still, of all the masks they could have worn to rob a bank, why did they choose to wear nun masks?  I mean those masks make them look too creepy.  Overall, despite the apparent flaws this movie has, it is a very enjoyable film for anyone who enjoys good old-fashioned drama.

B002ZG99TA|5.0|Chris Pine has really become quite the actor. I saw him first as Captain Kirk in Star Trek, and since then, I have gone back to watch a couple of his earlier movies along with the lower-budget Sci-Fi flick, \\"Carriers.\\" In \\"Unstoppable,\\" he really turns on the heat, and side-by-side with good ol' Denzel, he shines.<br /><br />Here was a movie that, while viewing the trailers, I was thinking, \\"Really? An entire movie about a runaway train?\\" Well, the resounding answer is, \\"YES!\\" An excellent back-story, along with a perfect amount of character-building to get us to really like these people, made for a foundation on which to build one heck of an over-the-top mountain of suspense! In addition to Chris, Denzel Washington was excellent, as always, and the rest of the acting crew, especially Rosario Dawson, were perfectly cast and on top of their game as well. The main character was more than just a menace, though, it was downright deadly...THE TRAIN!<br /><br />A review I read on another site said that this movie started slow, but by the time Chris and Denzel's characters got in on the action it was non-stop fun. Well, I'm here to tell you that this movie gets rolling within the first five minutes...literally...rolling. The action and suspense builds by leaps and bounds, second-by-second. On more than one occasion, \\"Unstoppable\\" gets you to hold your breath in anticipation of the next scene, or simply steals it altogether. This one comes highly recommended.<br /><br />This is now one of Tony Scott's masterpieces. Great work to all! Five stars! *****
B002ZG980U|4.0|When I first watched this film, it kept me constantly guessing what was real and what was a dream.  It kept me at the edge of my seat when they were executing the operation in their victim's mind.  Leonardo DiCaprio was just as good and actor in this film as he was in The Departed.  In many ways this movie reminded me of the Matrix because they left reality and entered a world that exists in the mind.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|Great value for the price ... I can't begin to tell how much fun our family has had with this chip reader, iPad and digital camera while on vacations. Talk about immediate gratification, after a fun day we would relive all the experiences of the day over dinner on the iPad's great screen. Transferring images and video directly from our Coolpix camera couldn't be easier - no laptop or iTunes needed!    The SD chip reader is great most digital cameras since there is no cable required. For larger cameras, using CF cards, you will need to carry a short USB cable and use the USB adapter included in the pair.    NOTE: these readers ONLY allow you to \\"read\\" FROM the chips or cameras - you cannot transfer anything TO a chip or camera. Nor can you use the USB adapter to read from a USB Thumbdrive. The USB device must be a camera or smart device, not a storage device ( cannot read from a portable USB hard drive). This fact is most unfortunate, but for what the reader does do, it's a great value. I suspect the limitations of this device have more to do with digital rights management enforcement than technical limitations.    Interestingly enough, you can use the USB adapter with your iPhone USB cable and transfer photos from your iPhone to the iPad.
0891419063|5.0|E.B. Sledge's \\"With the Old Breed\\" is an outstanding and unforgettable book. Sledge writes in such a unique style that is so easy to read and keeps you turning the pages. The descriptions of his experiences are utterly vivid and give the reader a glimpse into the horror, fear and confusion that war actually is. The dedication and bravery of these many veterans is truly unbelievable. These guys are genuine heroes. Any reader who has never endured combat will develop a different opinion of what war is really like and will discover in themselves a new found honor and respect for those that served this country in such an unselfish way. \\"With the Old Breed\\" made it clear to me that there is no way to ever fairly repay these veterans for the sacrifices that they personally made in maintaining the liberties and freedoms we so casually enjoy in the United States.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough!! Read it and you will understand.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|Hi  Firstly many thanks to Amazon for their speedy delivery and stress free service for me to then sit and watch hours of one of my favourite programmes.  This season seemed darker than the last..  I still can not get use to Jim being Jim again not even a snippet of the actual body he is in.  The skip to their lovely baby to a boy was probably expected it could have taken a lot of drawn out episodes to get Aiden to school.  I enjoyed all of the episodes and it kept me entertained as usual and of course in tears in some.  The turn around of Aiden saving his mum was good.  Oh Melissa's fashion are always an interest to me, but why you would wear some of the things she does on a normal day is definately questionable.  I certainly hope there is another season to come can anyone tell me???  Enjoy everyone  Blondieoz
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Hearing about the (implied) problems the director had with the people from Marvel, who own the rights to the character, one realises we were lucky this film is as good as it is. It is a shame when a film (Iron Man) whose success was uncertain and which was a gamble, but which turned out to be very profitable can be a curse. Everyone involved wants to repeat the success, especially the financial return, but at what cost?    I will always be glad we got the first film, which I feel is a classic. I just hope things don't get worse with Iron Man 3 - a lot of us know how sequel quality seems to go downhill, yet we still support them and make up the audience for them - strange, isn't it?

B001U3Y5XE|4.0|I got this on a whim recently, and my husband, my mother, and I played it for hours. Beware, it is incredibly difficult because they don't give you the amount of bricks you really need to pull off your ideas. It requires you to get VERY creative to succeed. On one of the level 3 cards for instance, they have the sydney opera house... WHAT!? BUt regardless, this was a full evening of amusement. My niece (8) and Nephew (12)came over recently, and while they had some difficulty with specifics, they still enjoyed it. For instance there might be a car, but they want you to say formula 1, because otherwise \\"car\\" is too simple, but you have to adjust the difficulty as needed. I had an earthmover, and the kids said bulldozer. Close enough, but not at the same time. I would strongly suggest buying a cheap bucket to expand the game with so that the kids have more fun, and the game doesn't drive you insane.    SO much fun though...
0307387178|3.0|Into the Wild is a narrative biography of a young man who, after drifting around America for a few years, decides to go into the Alaskan wilderness for an adventure. There, he dies out of utter stupidity and conceit. Granted, Krakauer does not think the guy's stupid or conceited, that's my personal opinion. The reason I liked the book so much is because of Krakauer's engaging narrative. Interspersed within the story of the main character, Krakauer inserted interesting little snippits about other conceited idiots who've died in the wilderness. It's sad, yet somehow fascinating. Like checking out the aftermath of a natural disaster. Can people really be so pig-headed and naïve? On the other hand, I agree with several of the other reviewers. Why should we care about this one guy? He's not the only idiot who walked into the Alaskan wilderness with nothing but a bottle of water and a copy of Walden--my exaggeration--never to be seen again. But, whatev. I still found the book interesting.
B003N3DU1W|5.0|I am a Japanese.   In Japan, the funeral expressed in this movie is not general.   The dead bodies clean and change clothes to a special one by employees of a company is not such custom.   Therefore, this movie is a strange sense even if it sees from Japanese.   Because the process seems in the region is very limited.   I think that you should not think it's normal manners of Japan.   But actually,the dead bodies are burned at the end of funeral is generally accurate.   Though,I was moved and cried.  A lot of Japanese have that emotion as same as me.  I'm sorry for my poor English.   Thank you for reading.
B002ZG999U|4.0|It is rare I do a review on a movie this soon after being on DVD but,alas,miracles do happen and here I am.The Expendables released in August/10 stars many major and minor action stars of the present and past including Bruce Willis,Arnold Schwarzenegger,Sylvester Stallone,Jet Li,Dolph Lundgren,Steve Austin,Mickey Rourke,Eric Roberts,Jason Statham,Terry Crews and Randy Couture.I was  disappointed in this film because with all these actors I had very high expectations;maybe too high. Stallone's direction I thought was acceptable,as was the plot.<br />The story which is as see through as silk stockings,starts with a hostage taking on a ship off of Africa(some might argue Mr Stallone is keeped it direct,but simple).Stallone leads a mercenary team to the rescue and does it with quick dispatch.However team member Gunner played by Lundgren(doing his fave psycho-soldier routine from Universal Soldier)goes a little over the top when he wants to hang one of the pirate hostage takers.He's stopped and is summarily kicked off the team for being untrustworthy.<br />Back home team leader Barney(Stallone) is summoned to a meeting with a Mr.Church(Willis)in a....where else?..church.At the same time he has invited an old rival of Barney's called Trent(Schwarzenegger)to outbid Barney,if he's so inclined,for the job.The job is to go to an imaginary island called Vilena in the Gulf of Mexico to overthrow the dictator there.Trent tells Church to give the job to Barney as he \\"likes to play in the jungle\\"(referencing his Rambo days)and walks out.Church asks Barney what Trent's problem is and he replies\\"He wants to be President\\"(referencing his current political life).<br />Barney and a small reconnaissance team suss out the island and barely escape with their lives.It seems the man pulling the dictators strings is an ex CIA agent gone rogue called Munroe.Barney now knows that the real target is Munroe not the dictator.However he had a brief encounter with the dictators daughter on the island who is vehemently opposed to her fathers rule but elected to stay behind when given the chance to leave.He can't get her out of his mind and decides to return to rescue her,without his team.But the team elects to follow their leader and a long and bitter struggle ensues with Stallone killing Munroe and ending the reign of terror on Vilena.<br />This film is not much more than the window dressing that covers it,or a book with a lovely dust jacket with nothing inside,if you will.We have all these well known actors,buffed up,with testosterone oozing everywhere and nothing much at all to do or say;and what they do say and do is predictable and sometimes unappealing.But what,in the end,Stallone brought these guys together to do,he succeeds in tremendously.This group of guys is not here to do Shakespeare or to win Academy Awards.Stallone knows the appeal of the action film genre,as he has been part of it for most of his career,along with all the others on board.No,action and only action,INTENSE action,action BEYOND action,is what is served up in large dollops here.And I think most guys would agree,it went down mighty good.The action is not for the feint of heart,with over the top explosions,kills and lots and lots of blood and gore.Also,think about this aspect of Stallone's train of thought re making this movie in the first place.Not only will the film attract HIS fans,but also those of each and every other action man on board this film.This is a film that could not help but be a win,win at the box office.Mr Stallone is NO dummy folks.<br />The film is about 103 minutes long and comes in its 2:35:1 widescreen format.The transfer has been well done and the Dolby 5.1 sound is very good.Extras include an audio commentary by Stallone,a making-of featurette,deleted scenes,a gag reel & trailers,on the Blu-Ray copy only.The DVD copy has just the trailer as an extra,and there is the digital copy for your computer.<br />In conclusion what should have been a great send up of past action movies with a heavy hitting cast,the likes of which you rarely see,was a little disappointing.However Stallone and company did deliver the INTENSE action they set out to,just not at the level I thought they could and should have.This combo pack is certainly a good buy.3 1/2 stars.t action movies with a heavy hitting cast,the likes of which you rarely see,was a little disappointing.However Stallone and company did deliver the INTENSE action they set out to,just not at the level I thought they could and should have.This combo pack is certainly a good buy.3 1/2 stars.

0316069485|5.0|I wasn't sure if Michael Connelly could tie the two men, Haller and Bosch together after revealing their family ties. After the numerous Harry Bosch books and the Lincoln Lawyer - the connection seemed contrived. But in The Reversal it works but is not what drives the story. Connelly's use of the first and third person from chapter to chapter seemed forced in the beginning but maybe it was the surprise of it. Hard to handle this contrivance and many have failed but Connelly shows he can do it and tell a great and engaging story.<br /><br />I still can't see Haller as a prosecutor, but good to see Bosch at his best. The pier scene is like his tunnel days in Vietnam.<br /><br />Keep it up Michael, and the Water Grill is my favorite restaurant in LA. I wonder if he gets a little better service there than most.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Retirement sucks, as anyone can tell you.  For former black-ops CIA agents, the inactivity would drive a person insane.  Bruce Willis (Frank Moses) is suffering from that insanity.  He's a loner, his house lacking all the essential necessities to make it a home, and he's bored out of his mind.  He doesn't know how to blend into the neighborhood, pitifully viewing the landscape for what is expected. His desperation, his loneliness, and the inactivity of retirement leads him to tear up his retirement check and call an ever patient, equally lonely customer service agent in Kansas City.  The conversations with Sarah (Parker) are the highlight of his month and, through these conversations, he attempts to become more 'normal'.  Someone should tell Frank that a man reading a romance novel is not considered 'normal'.<br />This retirement that eats at Frank's nerves is shattered when a hit squad attacks his house in the middle of the night.  Frank, as skilled as ever, kills the assassins.  Decades of training leads him to believe they have tapped his phone lines, and he's off to Kansas to save his phone buddy Sarah. Her reluctance to be saved (imagine someone you've only ever spoken to being in your home when you come back from an excrutiatingly boring date!) causes Frank to kidnap her.<br /><br />Sarah goes on a wild ride with Frank while he attempts to discover who is trying to kill him and why.  He travels cross country to find the members of his old black ops team, who are all equally retired and bored to death. Meanwhile, the viewer discovers the CIA is the machine behind the attempt on Frank's life.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman (Joe Black) is at his suave self, living in a retirement community and suffering from stage 4 cancer.  John Malkovich (LSD paranoid Marvin) hides in tunnels and carries a stuffed pig under his arm.  Helen Mirren proves that mature women can be sexy carrying a high powered rifle,and arranging flowers in a Better Homes and Garden style home. Her comment about taking an 'odd job on the side' still makes me laugh.<br /><br />This is an all-star cast of superb actors that deliver an action-packed, fast paced, comedic, and highly entertaining film.  The twists and turns are thrilling. I loved every moment of it and it proves that even the retirees have a magnetic bit of life still left in them.'odd job on the side' still makes me laugh.

B003PIUBZS|1.0|if you are looking for things like good writing, good acting, respectable production value, and believable action sequences, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.     what you will find here is nothing but terrible dialogue, pretty actors delivering some of the most stilted and awkward performances outside of a kindergartner's christmas pageant, bullet-time overloaded sword and sandals fight scenes, and softcore pornography.    usually i'd tout the pornographic aspect of the series as a redeeming quality, but in this case, it isn't enough to make up for the deficiencies. in all, this is an even less intelligent distant relative of xena: warrior princess that takes itself far too seriously for its own good.
0345444051|4.0|Arthur C. Clarke's book is short, poignant and perfectly executed.  He starts with a simple premise of alien's becoming caretakers or overlords for humanity.  Far from destroying humanity or contrastingly, ensuring the happiness of humanity the overlords goal is quite more complex.  The overlords do work to make the lives of humans better but they also act as protectors for the solar system when humans make the next leap in evolution, beyond their planet.  This is a short science fiction book that spends little time on character development or setting the scene.  This book is all about imagination, creativity and forcing the reader to think about our place in the universe.  In that sense, this book is perfectly executed as the author provides an all encompassing view of 'universal evolution'.  There are so many ideas in this book that inspired other movies, books etc that were incubated in the mind of this man.
B003ZVJFFM|2.0|This film was a disappointment, especially given that it was helmed by one of Hollywood's best directors, Robert Zemeckis.<br /><br />Most people are probably aware of Charles Dickens classic story about an embittered old man being visited by three ghosts on Christmas Eve in a final attempt to salvage his humanity. Most of us eagerly anticipate the latest revisioning of this beloved tale, but its success or failure depends on if we emotionally connect to the characters enough to share in Scrooge's warm and fuzzy transformation at the end of the tale.<br /><br />There were some interesting riffs off old ideas, but unfortunately this version simply didn't work for me.  The style of animation was weirdly cold and artificial - it felt like watching someone play a \\"Christmas Carol\\" game on Xbox or PS3. Too bad Disney didn't tap Pixar for this.<br /><br />The end of the visitation by the ghost of Christmas Present added to the overall macabre vibe.<br /><br />This story has many superior previous versions, including the classic [[ASIN:B002EXW7DY A Christmas Carol [Blu-ray]]] and the often maligned [[ASIN:B0000AQS5D Scrooge]]
0307454541|2.0|This book took too long to get to the meat of the plot, and by then I had pretty much lost interest. I was also uncomfortable with our hero screwing around with all three of main female characters in the story, especially since the crimes he was investigating were obviously sexual in nature. I didn't find this aspect of the story to be interesting, titillating or amusing - just kind of creepy. The casual sex against the backdrop of sexual violence didn't mix well.

B000IAXVGW|5.0|Captain Kirk says, \\"It is the ship masters privilege of uniting couples\\", and red alert sounds.  Outpost 4 is under attack by an unidentifiable enemy.  The implied and suspected enemy is the Romulans. No human has seen a Romulan.  The enterprise approaches the neutral zone.  Outpost 4 is one of many outputs built on asteroids to monitor the neutral zone.  Captain Kirk warns his officers that the federation can not afford to have a war with the Romulans.  Stiles wants revenge for the death of his ancestors lost in the original Romulan war. Battle stations, commander Hansen describes an unknown plasma weapon making deflector shields ineffective and disintegrates space vessels.  The station headquarters was a mile deep and the asteroid composition was iron.  The Romulan ship appears, discharges their plasma charge, and destroys output post 4. The Romulans are unaware of the enterprise having departed back to the neutral zone.  Stiles believes there is a Romulan spy onboard the enterprise because the coincidence of events seem improbable.  Stiles is biased towards Spock. Romulans and Vulcans share a common history.  The Romulans seek to prove the humans are weak.  Kirk must prevent the Romulans from returning to the empire to prevent a war, death and more death, \\"millions upon millions of lives\\", \\"can we engage them?\\"  The Romulan cloaking device uses enormous amounts of power and makes tracking the enterprise challenging.  Stiles wants to attack, but Kirk was to watch his opponent. Stile wants to know \\"why Spock left out certain historical facts about the Romulans\\". Spock admits to the Vulcan and Romulan shared ancestry.  Spock seems embarrassed by his history of warlike ancestry. \\"Do you want a Galactic war on your conscience?\\"  Kirk initiates a plan to attack the Romulans.  Using the frozen ions from comet magnitude 7, he hopes to discover the Romulan ship and destroy it, \\"a big gamble\\".  The Romulan commander realizes the tactic and order full evasions orders.  Stiles thinks that a Romulan spy has reveal the commanders tactic and eyes Spock suspiciously. Kirk orders blanket phaser fire which damages the Romulan ship and kills a centurion. The Romulans shoot their plasma weapon, but the enterprise retreats and escapes because the weapon has a limited range. The Romulans return on course to the neutral zone, \\"once inside they can claim we violated the neutral zone\\", says Kirk.  Captain Kirk needs permission to enter the neutral zone, but proceeds without it.  The Romulan captain tells his officers, that Kirk wants them to waste their energy and it \\"will take all his experience to get home\\". \\"We have lost them\\". \\"Don't destroy the one named Kirk\\".  Spock accidently touches a control which gives the Romulans their position.  Kirk responds with fire phaser bursts. \\"We are beaten\\".  The Romulan ejects debrie into space and his centurion friend. \\"Glorious\\" \\"Now we go home\\" \\"They are at your mercy\\".  This is the fatal mistake for the Romulans.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  My only complaint is that it goes by a little too fast and is a little confusing in some parts because a lot is cut out.  Course that is what happens when movies based on books are made.  All in all it's very well done and I like that it's not the conventional vampire story.  Can't wait till the American adaption comes out on video.

B002ZG98PA|4.0|I originally had no interest in seeing \\"Tangled\\" based on the theatrical trailer, but good reviews convinced my family to go after dinner on Thanksgiving Day.  We had a great time among three generations: grandparents, parents, and 11-year old.  The audience was mostly families with younger kids, which was a mistake for some.  At least one family with two kids under 6 left a half hour into the movie and didn't come back.  Many parents might hear \\"Disney\\" and  not notice that the film is rated PG.  It gets that rating for a good reason, with some creepiness that may resonate more on an adult level (Mother Gothel kidnapping Rapunzel and their weird faux-mother-innocent-daughter interactions) but also some cartoon violence that comes across as scary on a little kid level.  When Flynn and Rapunzel venture into the tavern \\"The Snuggly Duckling\\" they meet a cast of scary-funny rogues like you haven't seen since \\"The Poison Apple\\" in \\"Shrek.\\"    For ages ten and up (or a little younger if the idea of \\"intense\\" doesn't worry you), it's raucous fun with an almost Monty-Python-esque twist at some times; Indiana Jones action at others;  and romance reminiscent of the \\"Kiss the Girl\\" scene in \\"The Little Mermaid.\\"    Rapunzel and Flynn were winning characters, and you'll be treated to the funniest horse I've ever seen on film.  The backstory of the King and Queen losing their baby princess stayed mainly in the background, but added a lot of emotional weight threaded through the story.    You see the Pixar storytelling fingerprints all over this Disney film, with animation legend John Lasseter producing, and that's a GREAT thing.  Lasseter added humor and action to a classic fairy tale, and kept the emotional heart intact to come up with a winning family film.

0618918248|1.0|Not just another book that makes one hope in vain that proselytizing atheists would just learn to enjoy their belief system peacefully and grant others the same privilege. This one is worse than usual. It displays an almost ridiculous absence of any understanding of what religious faith is, why it is, and why it is certainly not going to go away because someone who should know better claims science has disproved it. There are many atheists who know better; Dawkins should learn from them (he will not suffer to learn anything from a believer, obviously; his contempt is impervious to the notion that the better part of humanity might have some reasons for their beliefs that he is missing by dismissing them as nonsense without, apparently, the most basic familiarity with them that most of us get from living in a pluralistic world and not knowing in so ironclad a fashion as Dawkins, without need for inquiry, that he and those who share his minority opinion are right and all others wrong--including the roughly half of American research scientists who believe in a personal God, and understand that science permits that perfectly well). For the scientific community has made no such claim as Dawkins implies; it is very hard to imagine how one might suppose it had, in the absence of any evidence to that effect and the unquestionability of the fact that it has not. Better scientists than dawkins, or more likely ones who do not let their personal beliefs blind them to what they know of their great profession, know what questions science is well designed to answer; the greatness of science, why and how it gets closer to the kinds of truth it can than any other approach, is precisely knowing why and how it gets closer to what kinds of truth than any other approach, and what may be true or not but is not in the realm of science, and no respectable scientist should claim is. Not when he could never get that statement past peer review. Dawkins knows he is not writing science and thatthat is why he could not publish \\"The God Delusion\\" in the scientific literature and had no venue that would take it but the pop press, which has no such standards as peer-reviewed journals. And that he would have been laughed at by his peers for the very attempt. If he does not know that, he is more self-deluded than any believer in a transnatural, which is an open question as the failure of \\"The God Delusion\\" to meet the standards of science is not. Shame on him for being either a fool, or a liar by omission of that most relevant and indisputable fact.

B003VR5PPY|5.0|9 Hours to escape  9 People caught in this mad game of numbers  9 Doors that will determine their very fates within a ship    These people are put into a game known as the \\"Nonary Game\\" where they must escape within 9 hours from a crazed person only known as \\"Zero\\" and make it out alive.    This game is very. very interesting.  The moment I put this game into my DSi and played for the first 10 minutes, I was sucked into these people's lives that hang in the balance.  The first few minutes put you in a room with the main character, Junpei, where he must escape from a room being filled with water, and FAST!!  This game uses the whole point and click system where you look around a room and use your stylus to tap on objects to find clues and items that will help you escape from different situations in the ship.    **Some spoilers**    My favorite part in this game is not only the puzzles, but the dialog.  The narration isn't bland like some other games.  But, is literally made like you're reading a book.  When you're stuck in the water-filling room with Junpei, the narration is very, very thorough and very detailed.  Some parts will tell you about the description of the room to the restlessness of the characters to (I'm not kidding you) the full description of a body after it was blown up.  It's not, \\"the body was blown up into a million pieces\\", but rather tells you something like, \\"the blood splatter was all around the room and chunks of the flesh where strewn around the room\\" blah blah blah.  I'm not kidding, this is how detailed the narration is.    **End spoilers**    If there's anything else I like about the game, it's the 9 characters you encounter and must escape with.    Ace, Snake, Santa, Lotus, Junpei (the main character who doesn't have a codename), June, Seven, Clover, and the 9th Man.  Each have a past that connects them all together and Junpei must find out why they are all connected so that they can escape from the ship.    If I were to say whether to buy this game or not, I would say, \\"buy the damn game already\\".  This game might be a sleeper title, and is already one of my favorite games for the DS.  The story is good, the characters are all intriguing, the puzzles are all there to make you think, and the short amount of time that you have makes it so that you have to rush the puzzles.    So, 5 stars to this game, story, gameplay, and all others.    Just to note: this game has a long of history in it, from the Titanic, to real people that changed the very world to chemistry.  So, if you're not into reading a lot, don't buy it, but you are missing out on a great game!!!!

BUT.... what makes these guys think they need to re-invent the packaging to make it \\"extra-special\\" ???  The discs rest with the playing surface flat against cardboard drawers and have to be slid out.  The first disc I pulled out is already scratched from the friggin' stupid cardboard.        BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY...  and this is the most stupid and unforgivable.... There are three different versions of the movie.  Theatrical release ( which nobody on the face of the Earth or Pandora will EVER watch )  The 8-min extended and the 16-min extended.  All three versions of the film are CUT IN HALF between the first two discs!!!!   That's right, you have to get up in the middle and change discs!  Yes, of course they could have put one of the WHOLE films on each of the 3-disc set but Nyoooooo!  That must have been too common for Avatar.... you should have to WORK to enjoy such an epic as \\"Dances With Wolves In Space\\".... Agh-hem, sorry I mean Avatar.
030726999X|1.0|I rarely write reviews of books I've recently read but was moved to do so in this case as rarely have I waded through a book that I disliked so much.  I enjoyed the first, wasn't so keen on the second and detested the third.  Following on from the theme of the first two books the protaganists seemingly could do no wrong while the police and the bad guys could do nothing right.  The author appeared so in love with Salander and Blomkvist that he's unable to portray any good deeds on behalf of the other characters.  It was all so one dimensional.<br /><br />It started off by irritating me with 3 or 4 references in the first chapters to Blomkvist's makeshift duct-tape bandage.  These were referred to as genius and a revolutionary new bandage by doctors and ambulence men alike as if you may have missed it but this Blomkvist guy, he's amazing!  Then the comments towards the end about so and so's story being voted \\"News Story of the Year\\" and Christer Malm's photo \\"which would go on to win Photograph of the Year\\" became so regular that it honestly made me laugh out loud!  The amount of women that fall hopelessly in love with Blomkvist too had me raising my eyes to the heavens.  The repetition continued through the whole book as though the author was worried he hadn't quite got his point across.<br /><br />I do like the prose style and the first two books did enough to keep me reading to the end; their was a good story in there that I wanted to read.  However Larsson's inability to give any main character any flaw other than having a mind of their own added to the bad guy's helplessness at Blokvist and Salander's hands just served to make the book dull.  You were never in doubt as to what the outcome would be.

B002ZG981E|1.0|For months, just like everyone else on Earth, I've been hearing and seeing the buzz surrounding Christopher Nolan's newest film, Inception. However, due to time constraints caused by college and other personal matters, seeing the movie wasn't high on my list of priorities. Since I just got a mini vacation from college this week, I found some time to finally watch it, and I must tell you, the movie left me scratching my head. Now don't let that past sentence fool you. I wasn't scratching my head over how \\"complex\\" the movie was, but rather over why so many people are hailing this as one of the greatest movies ever made. Sure, this movie is a deep and complex brain twister if you're only familiar with the cookie-cutter Hollywood swill like Smokin' Aces or the Twilight franchise, but go read a Philip K. Dick book or watch a film by Satoshi Kon or Andrei Tarkovski, then come back and tell me how \\"genius\\" Inception is.<br /><br />STORY<br /><br />\\"Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the best there is at extraction: stealing valuable secrets inside the subconscious during the mind's vulnerable dream state. His skill has made him a coveted player in industrial espionage but also has made him a fugitive and cost him dearly. Now he may get a second chance if he can do the impossible: inception, planting an idea rather than stealing one. If they succeed, Cobb and his team could pull off the perfect crime. But no planning or expertise can prepare them for a dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy only Cobb could have seen coming.\\"<br /><br />-Taken from product description (too lazy to summarize plot myself).<br /><br />CHARACTERS<br /><br />What's a movie, regardless of how thought-out the plotting is without any interesting or properly fleshed-out characters? Unfortunately, Nolan overlooked properly developing characters or even giving them anything interesting or charming to their personalities so that we could latch on to them as the movie went along. With the exception of Cobb, the characters are either mere plot devices or exposition magnets. The biggest exposition magnet by far is Ariadne played by the miscast Ellen Page. She spoon feeds every little detail to the audience, not letting us think for ourselves. Some of the worst offenses are with the scenes with Ariadne telling Cobb after a flashback or dream \\"You have some dark stuff buried in you.\\" You really think so? Whatever happened to \\"show, don't tell?\\" Cobb's inner demons revolving around his dead wife, Mal, had some potential, but I wasn't emotionally moved at any point in the film since Nolan was too focused on the architecture of the dreamworld and the little \\"ticks\\" going on with it rather than actual character development. Supporting characters like Saito and Arthur were very dull since like everyone else, were just plot devices.<br /><br />EXPOSITION, EXPOSITION! RUSH IT OUT A-S-A-P!<br /><br />For a movie acting like it's intelligent, it sure talks down to the audience. As stated before, nothing is left to the imagination. Much superior dream-related films like Total Recall (1990) and Paprika (2006) establish their own rules about dreams and create dreamworlds that require one or two little bits of exposition and after that, you fully understand their workings and can enjoy the rest of the films without further explanation. However, the dreamworld in Inception was way over-developed since there's too much to the structure as to where it requires constant explanation. This is a clear case of too much complexity killing a potentially good idea. Some might defend the heavy dialogue, stating that the explanations give people a full understanding of the universe Nolan created. However, it doesn't work with me because when I watch a movie, I care about character development and exploration of certain ideas, I could care less about every tiny detail in a certain universe since I only want enough information as to where I can follow it.<br /><br />LACK OF ORIGINALITY<br /><br />Lots of people are hailing this as very creative and original. I can't disagree more with this notion because this feels like a stale copy of Paprika. Paprika focused on psychotherapists diving into the dreams of their patients to understand the subconscious better and to get information important to them (such as the theft of their technological breakthrough, the DC Mini). Inception focuses on people diving into peoples' dreams so they can steal or plant ideas. While Paprika had better visuals and characters to go with its dreamworlds, Inception opts for very conventional imagery and bland characters, thinking that the \\"amazing\\" multi-layered dreamworld is enough to hold the movie together.<br /><br />TOO MUCH CONVENTIONALITY<br /><br />For a movie focusing on dreams, Nolan's take on dreams was terribly vanilla. I don't know about the rest of you, but while my dreams can relate to parts of me that are entirely personal, they're largely nonsensical, unpredictable, and depending on who you talk to, disturbing. The lack of predictability in someone's mind renders the idea of a \\"dream architect\\" successfully creating a dreamworld in someone's head as a pretty silly one. Having Paris fold in on itself and having rotating mirrors on the streets wasn't too imaginative, and that's the only \\"surreal\\" imagery you get in this dream-themed film, everything else looks very conventional.<br /><br />PRETENDING TO BE \\"SMART\\"<br /><br />It looks like Nolan made some quick searches on Wikipedia to shoe-horn in some \\"smart\\" ideas into the film. The best example of this would be when Arthur explains to Ariadne the concept of the Penrose Stairs and explains how it's an infinite loop, and how it's that concept that's used to confuse inception victims, then the camera moves down to show that it's a regular staircase. Wow, wasn't that genius?!! The other part that pretends to be \\"smart\\" is the plotting. Again, Total Recall and Paprika successfully merged fantasy and reality and really twisted the audience's minds questioning what's happening is real or not. With Inception, however, it's quite easy to follow the dreams within dreams within dreams within dreams because they're neatly separated from each other, you just have to keep track of them (I guess Nolan thinks we're too stupid to do that). The last quarter or so of the movie gets extra convoluted with quick cuts between the multi-layered dreams and Cobb facing Mal in others. I guess this was supposed to make the movie puzzle-like and give the audience something to solve.<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK<br /><br />Nolan depends on Hans Zimmer to deliver an overblown score for an overblown movie. Since Nolan forgot to properly develop characters and give them any legitimate tension, he depends on Zimmer to fill nearly ever second of the movie with music to drive home how we're supposed to feel in certain scenes. Look, music can be a great element in enhancing the emotion in certain scenes, but when you're depending entirely on it to drive home certain scenes, that's just unprofessional.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />At the end of the day, Inception is just another \\"style over substance\\" over-priced summer cash-in (much like Nolan's previous movie, The Dark Knight), but unlike most others of its ilk, it really hurts itself by pretending to look like a thinking-man's film. At least the recent Transformers movies are honest with being loud special effects vehicles and the fans will agree with that notion. I'll give Inception some more points than that blue abomination Avatar since it felt a little more ambitious than that blue liberal propaganda piece, but it's still quite a wretched picture. If you want some great and truly thought-provoking sci-fi, go read the Selected Stories of Philip K. Dick and go watch Paprika (2006), Total Recall (1990), Solaris (1972), and Stalker (1979).<br /><br />The day that people stop looking at Nolan's movies through rose-colored glasses can't comesooner.not.

B002ZG976U|3.0|With its title, I hoped to see a movie with some toughness, sleaze, grit.  Sex and violence are appropriate ingredients for the movies, especially those set in bump-and-grind clubs with available, young, and provocative women. You won't find it here.  \\"Burlesque\\" is a glitzy pop musical starring the rising young singer Christina Aguilera and the aging pop diva, Cher. The movie may be a little naughty in parts and a bit of a tease  -- but so was burlesque after all -- but it is mostly antiseptic and bland.<br /><br />The story is set on Sunset Boulevard as Ali, a 20-something waitress from rural Iowa with a hardscrabble background but an unlikely aura of innocence relocates to Los Angeles in search of excitement and a better life. Ali chances upon a struggling, aging and anachronistic burlesque club jointly owned by a jaded old dancer, Tess, and her former husband. Ali has a drive to succeed and a gravelly belting voice like that of Etta James.  Ali spends some of her evenings alone, reading books about the history of burlesque and preparing for her chance. But in spite of some good moments, the story line is predictable. Ali works herself up to a lead role in the club under what becomes the mentoring of the seemingly hard-minded Tess. The movie is a coming-of-age story as well as Ali and a club bartender, an aspiring pop composer, begin what is for the most part a surprisingly sexless romance.<br /><br />I thought Cher's acting was mostly wooden in her scenes with Tess.  She is better in her own vocal numbers, especially in a soliloquy of a song, \\"You haven't seen the last of me\\" late in the movie. She also is effective in her scenes with her wisecracking gay assistant (and former lover from long ago) Sean, played by Stanley Tucci. Some of the dance numbers and Aguilar's singing are effective in their way, but they are not sexual and they are little of burlesque. The brief scenes offering cameos of Los Angeles streets and cheap apartments help create an atmosphere. The movie could have used more of them.<br /><br />The movie is an old-fashioned musical. Although modestly entertaining, it is bland and almost utterly wholesome and toothless.  Something more could be made of the subject.<br /><br />3.5 stars.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanhave used more of them.    The movie is an old-fashioned musical.

0316077054|3.0|3.5 stars  Like Beautiful Creatures, this sequel drew me in with the lush, vivid descriptions and fascinating characters.  However, Beautiful Darkness suffers from the same problems that plagued its predecessor: uneven pacing and a confusing ending that solves few of the problems that have been building up for 500 pages.  And who am I kidding--I'm knocking off a star for my favorite character, Liv, who really gets shafted in this book.  The delightful supporting cast is my favorite part of this series.  These two authors can be masters of characterization.  From Amma, Marian, and Macon to Link, Ridley, and Liv, this series contains an impressive supporting cast of witty, brave, and loyal characters.  These characters come alive for me, and I look forward to any scenes with them.  Where the book struggles is with the leads.  Ethan is a sweet voice for the story but perhaps not particularly realistic for a 16 year-old-boy.  And I admit--I've never been crazy about Lena.  The authors did such a good job having Lena push Ethan away that I didn't WANT Ethan to go back to Lena.  I understood he needed to help her and would always be there for her, but I thought a teen paranormal novel would finally break from the predicable relationship pattern and provide a fresh twist...and that brings me to Liv.  I adore Liv.  She's brilliant, loyal, and caring, and she could have been the sunshine Ethan needed after so much darkness. By half way through the book, I was completely cheering for Ethan and Liv. I thought, \\"Finally! We get a unique story where the guy and the girl (Ethan and Lena) DON'T end up together but everyone's still happy and the choices feel real.\\" Nope. I thought for sure the book was establishing that you can find love again after loving someone you can't be with. Yeah, he'd always love Lena (like his Mom loved Macon) but he could find sunshine, warmth, love, and acceptance with someone else.  I just loved how Ethan described Liv...how he said it felt like he'd known her forever, how easy and natural it was to be with her, how warm and caring she was. How could he throw that away to jump right back to Lena's cold, dark arms?  I was beyond disappointed when in the wrap-up at the end, Liv was relegated to a few quick sentences after she sacrificed so much and had such a natural, healthy connection with Ethan.      Was it just me, or did this book feel like it could have been about 100 pages shorter?  I remember feeling that way when I read Beautiful Creatures, too.  The world created by Garcia and Stohl is rich, captivating, and original; however, the pacing is uneven with huge chunks of the book that slow to a crawl and delve into talking about the same problems again and again and again (you get the point).  And after reading SO MUCH about the problems and conflicts, you expect a little resolution at the end.  Nope.  Just more confusing, vague endings that aren't really endings at all and more \\"choices\\" that aren't really choices.  At the end, didn't you feel like you were back where you were at the end of Beautiful Creatures?  After 1000+ pages, I really need a little resolution, here, instead of dragging out the same problem for two books.  Will I read the next installment?  Yes, but I hope the authors provide a real ending at some point.  There's a way to end a book (that's part of a series) where the reader feels satisfied and it feels like an ending, and yet the door is open for sequels.  I hope at some point the books in this series can give readers this kind of a satisfying ending.  And here's to hoping Liv gets an ending she deserves.)
068484267X|5.0|My heart was indeed heavy learning of our loss in the person of Frank McCourt as he supplanted my previous favorite author, John Steinbeck which I thought would never happen.  If you've a soul or ever truly loved I doubt we'll ever again have anyone so special or reading material so memorable.  Read, laugh, weep and rejoice all in the space of so few lines and throughout all his works.  I can't shake the feeling of being so alone now without his breathing personage.  Read on and delight in truly remarkable/memorable reading.
B001NFRA90|4.0|This is a great CD to have if you are an Emerson fan. The music is great and the recording pretty good. I like Hughes as a singer, but I really did not like his interpretation of Tarkus. Way too many inflections and sylizations. He sounded like he was going for a pop sound to music which couldn't be further from pop. I'm a huge Keith Emerson fan, so anything he does, I have. It's worth having for a sample of an era for Keith that is little known.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This is the first Sherlock Holmes book I have ever read, because I am only 11. It is an unpredictable onoing mystery that I do NOT want to ever put down. I do not read often but i would read this a million times if I could.

031603438X|5.0|It may not be pretty but Keith Richards does give a truthful account of his life.  It shows how much sacrifice (in all ways) the Rich and Famous pay for notoriety.  It also provides keen insight into Keith's views on music and other musicians (especially those he admires). He also gives a glimpse into the toll of being a heroin addict and his understanding of his motivation for using the drug and more importantly why he survived while many others didn't.    Do you need to be a Rolling Stones fan to enjoy this book? Probably not, although knowing something about the music and songs he describes adds immensely to a readers understanding of the times and culture during these different periods Keith writes about.    Although, I'm not sure I would call this book an enjoyable read - I will say that it's insightful.
B00461MY30|5.0|I agree with the reviewer above re: the packaging.  It's not what it could be.  That said, the reason I bought it was for the sound, and in all honesty, it was like listening to the albums for the first time.  I heard things I hadn't realized were there.  The vinyl is so quiet, it's really stunning.  If you're on the fence about making the purchase, I can honestly say that it far exceeded my expectations.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|After re-reading the classic book, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, I realized just how accurate this movie was in terms of characterization. This movie paints Holmes to be an irresponsible, chaotic, violent, and immature genius with a knack for saying the opposite of what people wish to hear. But a lot of people don't actually realize this is exactly how he is pictured in the book. They even perfectly mimicked the fast-paced, back-and-forth conversation style between Holmes and Watson that is seen in the original fiction. Holmes was also indeed a drug-addict, something they only hinted at in the movie. This movie was also incredibly exciting to watch, and to pull this off while perfectly holding the true image of Sherlock Holmes is something I don't expect, but am glad to see with a modern film. If you love the classic tales of Sherlock Holmes, then you will love this movie. I personally can't stop watching it.

B00275EGWY|5.0|I wasn't in Iraq, so I have no clue what it's really like over there, but I do have PTSD from severe childhood abuse--and I relate to the main character. The mentality of needing to be at war, and needing a constant rush of adrenaline is something I live with, and its why I love this movie...it gives a good idea of what it's like to be inside that mind.  Some veterans don't like the inaccuracies, and I respect their feelings...I just feel that it is movie, and things are changed for dramatic purposes.  I was a boxer, and I love Rocky, even though it has very little to do with real boxing...but it shows the heart of a certain kind of boxer. And I don't think most movie scenes of rape or child abuse are accurate in showing what happened to me, but I don't think movies in general can realistically represent real life situations--but they can capture a certain mentality or a feeling.  Just like Picasso or Van Gogh's paintings don't look like the people they paint, they are an artistic interpretation...
0439023521|5.0|Hunger Games shows with chilling reality a world in which a leftist government makes use of Darwinian evolution--drawn out to its logical conclusion--to help control the people. (For younger folks, the more left you go in politics, the more control the government has; the more right you go, the less control the government has. Hitler, for example, was a leftist. Kings, dictators, Communists, etc., are all leftists. On the far right is anarchy--no rule at all.) It's Orwell's 1984--only worse. Should be reading in high school English, and analyzed to warn the students of the dangers of giving government too much control.

B004BSIJ9Q|4.0|Kanye's newest album has an odd sound from his previous releases.  The beats on this album sound like a cross between opera music and trendy fashion show music creating more of a matured sound.  You're not going to hear any high pitched singing on this one.  This production on this album is very professional sounding. The sound is that of professional musicians rather than synthesized beats. There are quite a few great features from other artists; such as Jay-Z.  The rhymes on this one are standard Yeezy.  If you enjoy Kanye West's music then is definitely a must buy!<br /><br />In my personal opinion this is not a 5 star classic like his first 2 albums but it was worth my money.

If you're a fan of Science FICTION and Fantasy (not to mention Action and Adventure), then you'll love Avatar.  If you're not a big fan of science FICTION and fantasy, then you'll probably want to give this movie a miss.  I just don't understand why the naysayers didn't give this a miss to begin with if all they wanted to do is pick it apart for flaws that they chose to see in FICTION.  -kd5-

B002ZG98LO|5.0|Unlike [[ASIN:B00011V8IQ Alien (The Director's Cut)]], which had a great sequel in Cameron's [[ASIN:B00012FXAE Aliens (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B001VFM0YW Predator 2]] was a flop and an insult to Schwarzenegger's [[ASIN:B003L16FAE Predator]]. The more recent predator movies, like [[ASIN:B001451HX4 Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem]], were total garbage.     Thus, it was nice to see [[ASIN:B002ZG98LO Predators]] captured some of the magic of the original. Sure, it doesn't take many risks and pretty much copies the same recipe as the original, from who dies when and the finale. However, that's certainly better than taking bad risks. Fortunately, there are a few cool new twists.     The acting is generally pretty decent. Laurence Fishburne was the only one who seemed really out of place - his psychophrenia just wasn't believable.  But Adrien Brody, despite not being nearly as buff as Arnold, really fit the role of the tough super commando.    [[ASIN:B002ZG98LO Predators]] doesn't quite exceed the original, but it is certainly a worthy sequel.

B000002JPA|5.0|This was the first DT album I ever bought and I was impressed. \\"Pull Me Under\\" was the first DT song that I ever learned. I have to say that I don't understand the criticisms here. It's always the same thing - \\"80's, hairbands, and the word 'cheesy'\\". What was so terrible about the 80's anyway (don't shoot)? I thought the 80's provided us with some truly great music. Words like \\"cheesy\\" sound like they belong along side of other worn out slogans and buzz words. This album came out in the 90's and I as far as I was concerned this was an alternative to \\"alternative\\" (another buzz word). When a band comes along that actually can play their instruments I shut up and listen.<br />DT combines all of the best elements of my favorite bands - most of which weren't around in the 90's. I can hear Yes, ELP, Led Zeppelin, Journey, Queen, as well some Metallica influence. I appreciate them greatly for what they are. It's apleasure to hear a band try new things without being concerned about what category or era or decade someone tries to put them in.<br />I don't have all of their albums (not yet anyway) so I'm giving you a point of view here that's just based on the 5-6 albums I own by DT. I haven't been disappointed by them yet and I hope that they don't try to be trendy or whatever it's called these days. No rap music and no MTV BS and I'll be happy.
B0042816YK|1.0|There's nothing like spending two hours watching a self-centered woman trying to fulfill herself at the expense of others.  I was deeply disappointed and felt myself being increasingly annoyed by the main character as the film dragged on.  I was glad when my daughter interrupted me just short of the ending so I had an excuse to turn the thing off.  I don't feel compelled to find out how it ends.

I'm a horrible reviewer, so I'll just leave that to others with far better writing skills. I have listened to this album 5 times now and it's just so good, I can't seem to listen to anything else at this point. \\"Hell of a Life\\" is my favorite song on the album right now, but I'm sure that will change weekly.

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|Are you looking for a smart, gripping drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end?  My friends you have found it.  In the spirit of Band of Brothers, comes this genius of cinematography documenting the Pacific theater of WWII.  While fans of Band of Brothers will definitely appreciate this miniseries, take care not to file away \\"The Pacific\\" as merely a Band of Brothers part 2.  This miniseries is its own animal and Both Tom Hanks and Steven Speilberg deserve all the praise they receive for this series.

0553275976|2.0|As my title states, a smart person doesn't make a great writer of fiction. Through reading this novel I saw that Wolfe a lot of interesting ideas and is a rather well-studied individual, but his execution in this novel his terrible. He repeatedly destroys the momentum of the story with excessive detail. I found that I could often times skip fifteen pages and not miss anything but more pointless rambling about things that add nothing to the story. For example, Wolfe would often give us the salary of a character, then list how much he spends a month for food, clothes, cars, etc. There is another point where he goes into a irrelevant discussion about Christopher Marlowe. I could picture Wolfe jumping up and down, shouting, \\"HEY, LOOK WHAT I KNOW! I CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT EARLY MODERN ENGLISH DRAMATISTS!!\\" Also, while I understand that this is a satire, the character development is poor and there is not a single individual that the reader can bring themselves to feel sorry for except for Henry Lamb and his mother. The rest of the time you feel like you are just reading about a bunch of selfish bigots. This could have been an engaging novel about the socio-political situation in New York City in the late 1980s. But instead it turned into a self-indulgent monstrosity.    However, I would love to attend a lecture given by Wolfe. He seems like he would be an interesting person to listen to. But as a writer of fiction, he just doesn't cut it for me.
0143118420|5.0|I watched the movie twice, and was so atracted by the \\"in-between-line messages\\" I could detect that I decided to buy the book. Believe me: Its content will make you feel some kind of  a 'secret friend', a 'private counselor', a 'global history teacher' a 'jet to your childish/youth age'. And the style is so casual, confidential and fluid that you will be able to 'hear the voice of the author close to your ears'.     My advice: Buy and enjoy it. Give it as a Christmas present...!

B00275EGX8|5.0|I sympathize with all the details noted by troops who are IAV's; as a physician there has never been a medical show that doesn't seem ridiculous to me, and to every MD I've ever met.  But as a non-combatant who cares deeply about those who wear the uniform, the visceral power of this monumental film greatly overwhelms any flaws and makes it one of the best war films, period, about any war, ever.  Even for me, the foray into Baghdad and especially the pointless sequence in the desert were annoying detours: OK, they might use Barretts to detonate IEDs but surely they're not trained to sniper level; more ridiculously, however, the mercs, presumably ex-SAS, that they fought beside in that encounter would almost certainly HAVE been well trained on the Barrett and would never have been victimized by a distant insurgent who was clearly using an AK--which, at those ranges, would have been about as accurate as a smoothbore musket, not to mention the low training level of its shooter.  And of course, what about calling for air or other support?    But subtract those details and you have a magnificent, raw film.  Perhaps its most alluring aspect is the very narrow, yet compelling laser-sighted focus: what makes guys volunteer for a job like that?  And what on earth makes guys go back for another tour at EOD, or any extremely high risk duty?  This film provides the best exploration of that age old puzzle that I've seen so far.    (And everyone should really check out Bigelow's previous masterpiece, [[ASIN:B002DMJM5C K-19: The Widowmaker [Blu-ray]]], arguably the best submarine film ever made.  With Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson, how did that brilliant 2002 movie, the true story about a few sailors who probably saved a large part of the I-95 corridor from a Chernobyl cloud, get so overlooked?  Were people just not ready to view Soviet sailors as heroes, over a decade after the end of the Cold War?)    On the other hand, I can't argue with the recommendation for [[ASIN:B001MKLMJUDanger UXB]], a 30 year old British import about EOD in World War 2 London, shown originally on PBS in the U.S., a multi-part miniseries that is cerebral, romantic (the delicious Judy Geeson with Anthony Andrews) and as far as I can tell, accurate even down to scientific and mechanical details of bomb disposal in that era, when British Army--and, if the explosive  was an aerial torpedo, Royal Navy--officers faced the best devices German science could devise, specifically to kill the UXB (unexploded bomb) disposal officers.
B0044WUQ3G|4.0|If like me you enjoyed the gritty realistic feel of [[ASIN:B00064AE0G Open Water (Widescreen Edition)]], you will probably enjoy this tragic drama for its' \\"what would you do?\\" value.

B0010ZR160|5.0|I'll admit after seeing this film in theaters I was at once entertained but unsatisfied with the ending. I'm sure a lot of people felt the same way, but after thinking about it I became more and more convinced that it's the only way this film could end. I think that's why I like Gone Baby Gone so much, it makes you think about it's message and allows you to draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />Gone Baby Gone is an adaption of Dennis Lehanne's novel about a missing girl in Boston, MA and the effects this has on everyone involved with the case, most notably Patrick Mckenzie a young private detective who's been hired by the girl's aunt. Patrick meets the mother who comes off as a dead beat and almost seems oblivious to the tragedy around her. Patrick and his girlfriend/partner Angie team up with two police detectives and through most of the film we follow their investigation through the streets of Boston finding out not only about the little girl and her mother, but the influence this city has had on all of the characters. While a lot of the movie plays out in a usual crime/detective fashion (with, I'll admit some obscure revelations and red-herrings) it's when all of these points come together at the end and Patrick is forced to make a very hard but important decision that gives the film it's impact. You don't have to agree with his decision but very rarely has a movie actually made me think about an ending and what I want to take away from it.<br /><br />The cast of Gone Baby Gone is pitch-perfect. Amy Ryan got a lot of well deserved recognition for her role as the missing girl's mother, but it's Casey Affleck as Patrick who holds the most attention and creates an unforgettable character.<br /><br />Gone Baby Gone was Ben Affleck's first film as director and co-writer and he uses terrific Boston settings for his locations that give Gone Baby Gone an authentic air. His action scenes, while sparse are very exciting and very engagingly filmed.<br /><br />Gone Baby Gone is easily one of my favorite movies and one of the rare films that actually makes you THINK about what it's trying to say. As I said you might not agree with it's message but you'll be hooked through the entire film. This is must-see viewing!ovies and one of the rare films that actually makes you THINK about what it's trying to say.

B0034G4P7G|4.0|'The Social Network' is an entertaining (and fictional) account of the founding of Facebook and the lawsuits that came after. While the hype surrounding this film is a little overbearing the praise for the most part is well deserved.<br /><br />'The Social Network' starts out with soon-to-be Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg being dumped by his girlfriend causing him to drunkenly blog her and then with the help of his best friend Eduardo Saverin hacks into the Harvard network and starts his own program comparing the attractiveness of female students. After getting in trouble this draws the attention of the Winklevoss twins and starts Mark down a path to creating Facebook (eventually meeting up with Napster co-founder Sean Parker) and turning it into the multi-billion dollar phenomenon it is today. The film cuts between the depositions of the two lawsuits against Zuckerberg and the events that led to Facebook's founding while we get everyone's different views on events.<br /><br />It's the creative writing by Aaron Sorkin's screenplay that makes 'The Social Network' such an entertaining and energetic film from beginning to end. If I had one complaint it's that despite an open-minded approach I had a hard time liking any of the characters (even with the film's ending laying it's sympathies with Zuckerberg himself). That probably doesn't seem like a big deal and it certainly didn't ruin any of the movie's entertainment value, but with no one to root for or relate to I wasn't sure what to take away from the ending. Also, despite an ensemble cast there are no female main-characters and the women that are portrayed in this film are 1-dimensional at best (with the possible exception of Zuckerberg's girlfriend, at least at the beginning of the film).<br /><br />While you probably won't be adding any of the people in this film to your friend's list they are all acted to perfection!

141690977X|5.0|I bought six books when I was heart broken in a past relationship and this book advice is really amazing. Sometimes we want to hear nice things when we are heart broken, but this book tells you reality, it tells you the way we should think, and trust me, I got over the past relationship I had and now I am very happy in a new relationship exactly as the book says: It is not that hard when a man really loves you, it just comes naturally. I would recommend it 100% for women that are broken hearted. The author really understands women feelings. Congratulations for this work of art.
B00005NWLO|5.0|I bought this for my hubby for Christmas but that didn't last, he got his paws on it and into the cd player it went. We both owned this when it was a record and the turntable was a big thing. I actually think... no I know it sounds better than back in the day when it had all the snap,crackles and static. Love the cd bunches! I am happy to own this again!
0517053616|5.0|If you are a fan of William you need to add this book to your collection. It is a beautiful book that overflows with his wonders from the pen. The cover is embossed in gold and the pages are set up in double column for easy reading. There is a silk ribbon for holding your place. There are nice \\"wood block\\" type illustrations at the start of each of his plays and it is very nice. The paper is thick and woody. I enjoy this book very much and if you enjoy the poet of poets, you too will have hours of pleasure with this book.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I am very satisfied with my purchase of the Lion King DVD. It is one of my most favorite disney movies of all time. I have watched it 3 times since my receiving it. Thank you for your time and hope all goes well with your sales.    Thanks,   Jeremy
0786860707|5.0|The art of Disney is incredible. Inside this book you will find vibrant color cells, story board art, sketches and so much more. It walks you through the animations of Disney from the beginning of Mickey and Snow White and shares the stories of the artists, the triumphs and the pains of hand animation. It is now becoming such a lost art, and you can truly appreciate every pen stroke in this book. If you love Disney or Animation, this is a must have in your collection.
B003ES5ZPK|5.0|There really isn't much to say about this.  It makes it possible to plug HDMI cables in at an angle so that if you have a tight space, you don't bend or stress anything that would be kind of expensive to replace or fix.  This works well for that - it bends in all the ways it's supposed to.  If you've got an inconveniently placed port, this puts it at a more convenient angle.
1400052173|5.0|At points the details of Henrietta Lack's life, her family, and their mistreatment by the medical and scientific communities are so chilling you want to think them unbelievable -- but, given our nation's history of medical abuse of African-AMericans, it's painfully real. Horrific at times. The author succeeds at keeping Lack and her family in the foreground, rather than co-op their lives or act as the heroic white saviour.Incredible. I only wish Lack's daughter Deborah had lived to read it. A must read!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This novel greatly surprised me. Normally the extremely popular novels are catered to the masses and rarely combine a great story with great (or even competant) writing. This book does not fit into that mold, nor many others. With a very detailed and gripping plot, this novel is bound to keep you interested; the humanity and uniqueness of each character will keep you emotionally invested. Suzanne Collins has done what has been unachievable for many of the hugely popular authors before her: write a book that appeals to casual readers and serious readers alike. Well played, Suzanne.
1423134206|5.0|The Walt Disney Archive Series has already set the bar quite high with the first two entries in this series - Story and Animation.  However, the release of Design sets new levels when it comes to quality, content and presentation.  This book is packed with beautiful preproduction and design art that includes watercolors, drawings, sketches, color studies, and digital paintings.  Some of Eyvind Earle's paintings for Sleeping Beauty are included as well as Chris Sander's storybook inspirational art for Lilo and Stitch.  There are character design sketches for the Beast and Gaston by Glen Keane and Andreas Deja.  There's several pages covering the Black Cauldron which features two inspirational paintings by James Coleman as well as character sketches by Tim Burton, and there's much, much more.  Though I've collected most of the \\"art of\\" books from Disney, I haven't seen many of the works displayed in this book.<br /><br />While the first two books were amazing, what's great about Design is that in most of the artwork, all of the elements of character, color, design and background are coming together.  It's almost like flipping through a lavishly illustrated children's book of many different styles and viewpoints.  One could frame much of the work shown in this book and be quite pleased with them hanging on your wall. It really is a terrific book.
B002RKSCA6|5.0|This novel is a classic for many reasons. The writting is masterful, the plot is fanciful yet can be applied to everyone, and the characters are so well portrayed that you fear for them as the story progresses. Overall, Robert Louis Stevenson deserves his place among some of the greatest writers among his, or any, era.
B004B2RUX8|5.0|I agree with all the other reviews that the remastered songs are awesome, but I have one problem (at least with the digital download). All songwriting credit is given to Rick Davies', none for Roger Hodgson. Anyone familiar with the dynamics of Supertramp knows that if Rick is doing the main vocals, it's most likely his song, & vice-versa for Roger. I guess what bothers me most is that Roger wrote most of the bigger hits (especially on this album) & he's not being given credit at all. Also the former members of the band are touring Europe next year & Roger wanted to be involved & was basically \\"shut out\\" (They scheduled their dates to coincide with the same dates as his solo performances - after he scheduled his). Wouldn't a reunion be spectacular? This band has always been one of my favorites (& always will be). I hope they do the same thing with their other albums as well in the future. Again, an excellent re-master & if you're a fan - a MUST HAVE for your collection! The new live material is worth the price by itself (and they aren't just re-hashes of studio versions either). But give Roger his due credit, the other members are even using his songs in the ads for their shows, not cool (IMHO)... Check out Roger's \\"Eye Of The Storm\\" or the newly released \\"Classics Live\\" if you haven't already, they're both like having another Supertramp album for sure. Sorry if it sounds like I'm being petty...
B0015DROBO|4.0|While this book will not keep you on the edge of your seat throughout, it will keep you wondering what will happen next. At some points I was unable to put this book down, and at others I could not keep myself interested for long periods. Overall, the story is well designed, well written (and in this case well translated), and well worth struggling through some of the less interesting parts.
B00003CXAT|4.0|Spielberg's Jurassic Park was for the most part a revolutionary film, mixing the then-new CGI with traditional model effects to bring us dinosaurs.  The nitpickers might complain that the dinosaurs were all from the Cretaceous period.  Still, it won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction film for a reason.<br /><br />You know the plot:  a rich philanthropist, John Hammond, has found that cloning dinosaurs is a reality and decides to introduce the world to this phenomena by making a park that will entertain the rich masses to his little island.<br /><br />Everything is fine until we find the fat computer programmer is actually trying to sell dinosaur embryos to the highest bidder (Dennis Nedry, played by Wayne Knight, from Seinfeld).  In trying to escape and get his goods off the island and get his money (in the middle of a hurricane, no less) he shuts down the park's security system.<br /><br />This shut down then leads to massive failure of the electric fence system and many of the dinosaurs get out -- and begin their mass destruction of the human's activities!<br /><br />The movie's main draw for me was the actual dinosaurs live on screen.  You knew that one of the characters was correct -- this was nature's power and she decided to have the dinosaurs up for extinction and yet Man brought them back is looking for trouble -- but to see them grazing, running, herding and killing each other was really thrilling!<br /><br />Much of the book's charm and character development was cut out of the script, written fairly well by Michael Crichton (who also wrote the novel) and David Koepp.<br /><br />The DVD also had some great features, including a fascinating \\"making of\\" and the decisions to use computer-animation techniques and meld them with traditional model techniques was fascinating, as well as an interview with Spielberg and what was going through is mind in shooting this film.  His excitement and interest over the project was fascinating.  A director's enthusiasm often translates to the crew and cast and this was evident in the film.<br /><br />The film achieves the \\"awe and wonder\\" that other reviewers have stated, but is missing the development of character that is very evident in Crichton's original novel.  Still, well worth watching<br /><br />Other Spielberg Films of Interest:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00012QM8G Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005QCYC Jurassic Park Trilogy]]<br />[[ASIN:B00003CX9Q E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial (2-Disc Widescreen Limited Collector's Edition)]]<br /><br />And of course books of interest:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0345370775 Jurassic Park]]<br />[[ASIN:034538122X The Making of Jurassic Park]]<br />[[ASIN:1600107605 Jurassic Park]]nd this was evident in the film.

B001DJLCPE|5.0|With all this debate on aspect ratio aside,  what knowledge I have of it is only from what I read throughout these reviews,  my opinion of the film is based on 1) the content of the movie itself and 2) how this BD version actually looked to me as I viewed it on my 50\\" Samsung Plasma HT system.<br />First I must say I did actually see this in the theater at the age of 11 with my parents when it was released. I was awe struck then and have always felt the same each time I've view it over the years. There is really nothing more I can add about the brilliance of Kubrick, the cast and crew in making what I consider one of the best movies made that hasn't already been said in the many reviews posted here.<br />My wife had never watched Dr. Strangelove and a few years ago I rented it for her...Well she was totally amazed at what this film brought to the table in terms of content and character.<br />So after I put together my home theater system earlier this year, Dr. Strangelove was one of the first titles I wanted to pick-up in Blue-Ray. After reading a lot of the debate going on in the reviews about the aspect ratio I was becoming greatly confused on which version would actually be the best one to buy...I finally gave in to the BD release with many of the special extras included (the had cover book with many of the movies photos was very nice, though I wished they had provided some sort of protective cover to slip over it).<br />I am so glad I did go with the BD version, even after all the talk back and forth about the different aspect ratio thing. The contrast level and deep blacks are exceptional. The film still has that bit of grainy quality to it, but I believe it was intended to be that way, it was still very sharp and clear and I didn;t really see anything cut off from the screen. The sound quality is quite good and comes out wounedful on my 5.1 surround sound. If you play Blue-Ray one will not be disappionted with this version. For anyone on the fence thinking about purchasing this, now is a great time to buy. The price is much lower now than when I bought it a few weeks ago and it's a terrific deal for what you get. I highly recommend it !this, now is a great time to buy. The price is much lower now than when I bought it a few weeks ago and it's a terrific deal for what you get. I highly recommend it !
B004DC2WF2|4.0|I can't give this 5 stars because I think some of the acting is a little sketchy, but I like the series a lot so far.  It has an appropriately charged atmosphere for the genre and the pacing is just right. Some reviewers complain  that there's not enough zombie-killing. The gaming audience is hard to please, but the paucity of graphic violence adds to the  shocking brutality of the action scenes when they do turn violent and it would be a short-lived series if the focus was  on mere gore instead of the interpersonal experiences of the survivors. The makeup and special effects are great and  the series seems to be pretty well written so far. These are hard characters for the actors because they have to project  the serious tension of the situation believably without appearing stiff or maudlin. The director is letting the actors be  a bit lazy in places but this is a really fun show even if you don't like zombies.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|Nutini's voice is haunting and soulful. These songs stay with me long after I've listened to the CD. His sound is refreshing and inspiring. His music makes me smile!
B003VPWXRO|5.0|I've always like Portia de Rossi but this book made me love her. Her writing feels like sitting with a friend whoes spilling her life to you. Its honest and open, candid and captivating. I was so engrossed I flew through the book and was only sad there weren't more pages. Not only does Portia de Rossi slip into the role of author seamlessly, the heartfelt nature makes you hang onto every paragraph. Its definitely a must read for anyone whose had food issues.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Ok, I am very biased, but if you are a fan of either of these two gals, go see the show.  \\"Haven't seen the last of me\\" made me cry.  But I am a big ol dork.  I can't wait for this CD to get here.

B0041X90ZS|5.0|After recording their first album in almost a decade, Transatlantic filmed a DVD on the ensuing tour. While several of the songs are the same as on their earlier \\"Live in Europe\\" DVD, the addition of the 70+ minute epic \\"The Whirlwind\\" and \\"Bridge Across Forever,\\" as well as a cover of \\"Return of the Giant Hogweed\\" (featuring ex-Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett) as an extra, results in a significant amount of new material. Furthermore, I think their performance is noticeably better on this DVD, making it a worthwhile purchase even for those with the earlier DVD.

B000A0GYD2|2.0|I watched the TV series back in 1998 on HBO and I liked it. I found it to be quite entertaining. At the time I wasn't quite informed about the Apollo and Gemini space programs and the show provided me with good information about them.  Skip to 2010. I bought the excellent book &#34;A Man on the Moon&#34; by Andrew Chaikin with a foreword by Tom Hanks. In it, Hanks claims to have used the book as the main source for the TV series. This book is very informative and covers a lot of details of the trips to the moon.  I watched the TV show once again to see how detailed it was about the whole Apollo program. I now realize that it leaves many, many things aside and it includes made-for-TV fictional drama. Consider the Apollo 14 mission, possibly the most challenging trip to the Moon, one that encountered never-ending problems from start to end. In the TV show, this mission is summarized basically  as a trip so that Alan Shepard can play golf on the Moon. This is simply bastardizing an epic mission.  Another episode is all about the wives of the astronauts and their hard, sometimes petty, troubles. This episode is almost nothing but fictional drama. Was it really necessary? The answer is no.  I could go on and on about other material left aside in favor of Hollywood-type fiction but you get the idea.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|My parents have now watched two great shows that I didn't get into until later, the first being The Big Bang Theory which is amazing, and just recently, Modern Family. I've seen three episodes from the Second Season and now I'm planning on buying the First Season. The characters are great and the show practicaly writes itself, it'll be hard for this show to end up bad. I figure most of these reviews are from big fans of the show, I'm giving this review as someone who has only seen three episodes, for your own sake, please watch this show, you've earned it.
B00008OP0H|5.0|I won't repeat what's been already said. THis is a great TV series and the DVD's material is great. I love the interface. I wish other DVDs came with original menus like this one.    I'll just add one thing: I just wish Tom Hanks had given the same respect to the V-J (victory in Japan) veterans than he did to V-E veterans instead of portraying as racist rednecks.    After watching The Pacific and Munich, it is clear now that Tom Hanks and Steven Speilberg have joined the ranks of the \\"blame evil America first\\" haters club so obnoxiously present at the UN.
B000OCZ0ZO|5.0|I don't consider myself any kind of a music reviewer, but I like Linkin Park and I really like this album.  It suffers from a few over-the-top politically-motivated tracks (\\"The Little Things Give You Away,\\" \\"No More Sorrow\\") but it's still a fresh and enjoyable departure from the nu-metal gospel of their first two records.  I loved the energy from the first track and this is still a regular in my rotation, although I am really starting to let their newest album \\"A Thousand Suns\\" grow on me.
B003NFM3JK|3.0|The presentation follows the formula and the dialog follows the formula. There is nothing wrong with different interpret ions of this Charles dickens classic. Yet there is nothing unique enough to justify this version. It is just a hum-bug. You may be better off reading the book. This story was made as much for children as \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\"<br /><br />Now if they could have hired the actors to act instead of just twisted versions of their voices, we may have a good movie. If you think that the cheap flashy animation will make it more palatable for children, you may want to rethink. The presentation would have to be morphed in to one of those watered down cutesy things that Disney is noted for. This Marley looks like it was designed by John Carpenter.<br /><br />Anyway it passes time and if it was the only version you own then it will do.<br /><br />Scrooge, and ill tempered spend thrift is awaked to his social duty by three ghosts that visit him on Christmas Eve. Who will get the spirit of Christmas, and who will get the goose? (O.K. turkey)<br /><br />I only saw the Blu-ray version so I cannot compare. There were the standard coming attractions trouncing 3D. The DVD extras include behind the scenes where they took the time to put dots on actors (motion capture) yet could have just made it as well with CGI.  There is a tutorial on Disney digital 3D.
B000LAZDQA|4.0|This movie is truly softcore pornography. Do not pop this into the player and expect some lightweight romantic comedy in which the scene fades when the stars get naked. They get naked and get busy in extreme closeups, no holds barred, both genders playing with both genders all the time. The language means those who are looking for something for their church friends to share at the ice cream social can't even turn off the picture and listen. It is life in the socially raw climes.    Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. But, as a formerly practicing bisexual and currently gay man, I would, wouldn't I? You might not.    It is a few days in the life of a sex therapist and several other characters in various colorations of repression from emotionally locked up to out there around Jupiter in matters of sexual expression.    I loved it. I didn't even know there was a movie out there that dealt with the 'joys' of living in a big city and all that can mean to individuals brave enough to dip their toes (and other body parts) into the pool.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|This is a great album! Most of the people that are complainting about this not being hiphop are the same people stealing music. Nicki minaj album is for all and it will be a wordwide liked album not a small group that dont even supports the music they like.     Stars that stay true to hip-hop/rb dont last lack of support  Monica vs Beyonce
0385737424|5.0|This book is absolutely remarkable.      I am a school librarian and after (tearfully!) finishing this book, I made an email to the entire English department to read it as soon as they could and recommended it as required reading for their curriculum.    The book begins with a punch, literally.  A punch from a stranger which separates two best friends. A secret note which tells the future.  The stories of children aching to belong. And ultimately, a redemption which will amaze you.    I, like many, put high value on books which win the Newbery Award.  They are the books which are timeless and the books which can shape the person you will become.  I was not surprised at all to learn \\"When You Reach Me\\" had received it, merely happy for a prize which is so well deserved.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Flawless Main Character  Great Group of Actors  Well Paced Humor  Enjoyable Plot    Highly entertaining movie to watch, I almost didn't watch it, glad I chose otherwise. Going into my collection.....now
B003NFM3JK|2.0|I just finished watching this for the first time and I was rather dissapointed in it. I think Disney could have done a better job and it was hard for me to sit all the way through. Unlike most of Disney's movies I wasn't able to really get into this classic tale and I found it rather dull and for my tastes to dark in some parts of the movie.
B002ZG997M|5.0|I give this movie 4.5 stars for being so well executed,Its Mad Max with Max replaced by a Samurai type character,lots of \\"the assassination of Jesse James\\" type Bleach By-pass effect and beautiful camera work.the music is excellent and the while the story is not really 5 star's,the movie works well as a whole,and your draws you into the post apocalyptic world of the Hughes brothers,the ending is a surprising too!!Overall a very interesting film.. I give it 4.5 stars!!
B003O85W3A|5.0|Here's pretty much how I went about this album.  1) What Arcade Fire? You changed? But I liked you the way you were!   2) Hmm.. actually, this' not half bad.  3) Wow, this is pretty great.  4) I love this album!    Any album that can keep me this happy during endless rain season has earned its 5 stars.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|This CD was released after significant press-releases, interviews, and implied \\"promises\\" (no pun intended, really) of its greatness.  Extensive accounts were released online of Springsteen's anguish and \\"dark night of soul\\" as he wrote and produced these songs while in the midst of a bitter legal contest with his manager at the time, and a recording company.  (I may not have all of that information down perfectly, but that's the idea...)  In short, my expectations were a bit dampened by the pre-hype for the product.  I heard Springsteen for the first time in 1976, and saw him in concert a couple of times in the years that followed (\\"Darkness\\" and \\"River\\" tours)  While there is not doubt as to the power of those shows in those years, and of the musical releases that followed, my hopes were not very high that The Promise would come close to capturing the flavor of Springsteen's music when I first heard it as a teenager. I reasoned, \\"if he needs this much build-up, TV appearances, interviews, FB \\"updates,\\" etc., is the product really going to be that great?  What are they compensating for here?\\"<br />I was wrong.<br />The Promise captures more of the passion, angst, and creative boil during that particular era of Springsteen's career than any preparatory media could have fully described.  It's not that listening to The Promise really takes me back to 1978; instead, it reintroduces me to that year, that time...explains why my life was so deeply changed and marked by the music of Bruce Springsteen, and why the honesty and raw vulnerability of a Springsteen song, let alone a 4-hour Springsteen concert, could truly be a life-changing, unforgettable experience.<br />If you've got a PhD in Springsteen-ology, you could probably find a number of deficiencies in The Promise, but if you're simply a grateful fan over the years, you won't be disappointed in this work.  You'll be grateful, and you'll remember...
B004BSIJ9Q|1.0|The Mastering On This Album Is Absolutely Horrible!! I Couldn't Even Listen To It! This Isn't Music Its Distorted Noise! Sounds Worst Than Jay-Z's Blueprint 3 I Hope This Trend Of Over Mastering And Clipping Music Ends Soon Or I'm Never Buying A CD From The Roc-A-Fella Label Again!! I Would Gladly Have Auto Tune On Every Album I Listen To Till The Day I DIE Then Have This Horrible Sound Quality!
0307346617|5.0|This was a great book. I really enjoyed the detail of how things unfold. Especially the way the people in the books' personalities jump off the page. For those who feel that it's interview style doesn't work really need to keep an open mind. A great way to cap off the zombie series. Max Brooks give great detail in this book. I hope he does more. The seriousness of this makes it seem almost real. There were times that I felt that this actually happened.

B0038BBA4I|5.0|This is the best new band to burst into the music scene in 20 years. They have a new, grassroots sound, play their own instruments, write their own songs, and don't rely on overproduced/remixing but rather on pure talent and music from the heart. The English country sounds, and the use of a banjo and a single bass drum on many songs is extremely refreshing. Songs like \\"The Cave\\" and \\"Little Lion Man\\" are obvious, instant hits (for good reason, they are killer songs) and are a great taste of more great things to come from this newcomer on the music circuits. Hopefully bands like Mumford will convince the world to play more than one-hit-wonder hip hop songs from artists who are only on stage because some producer from Def Jam saw him/her look good in a mall. I recommend this album to any music fan of any age, it gives the struggling music industry (and fans) hope for the future.

1595825045|5.0|This art book is by far one of the most amazing ones in my collection. It is packed full of art and information. It is beautifully done and should be in everyone's collection. I highly recommend this book. This is how art books should be.
1439181780|5.0|I took a basic psychology class a few months ago and the professor required us to watch The Secret video and then write what we thought about it.  This was towards the end of the semester.  I learned over the course of this class that several of my fellow students had been seriously abused or had other traumatic experiences in their life times.  I was a little reluctant to watch the video since I had gone through all the excitement and subsequent loss of interest when the book came out several years ago.  But I found that the movie sparked my interest a bit and I decided to get another copy of the book.  While searching I discovered The Power had just been released and I was so very intrigued what \\"the power\\" could be.  I quickly obtained a copy from the library and scoured the first pages to get to the mystery.  To my astonishment I found it easily, it wasn't hidden and it was plain and simply - love!  I felt really good about that because I have some beliefs about love and thought nothing but good could come from this book.  I was even more astonished to discover that the book teaches about being a more loving and positive person in a very plain and simple way.  It was one of those rare books that changes a person fundamentally and I was changed.  How much good could come from being a more loving person?  How much good could come from being more positive?  How great would it be if lots and lots of people read this book and embraced its teachings?  There is one drawback for me though.  I am a Christian and I know where all the good in my life comes from.  I acknowledge my God in the good things that come to me.  The book removes that from the big picture.  But there's nothing bad about loving one's self and being loving, kind and grateful more in our lives.  For me this book is a constant reference that I will use throughout my life.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I wanted to write a review of encouragement for those nervous about this book.  I was very hesitant to read it because I did not want to hear graphic details about rape.  Thankfully this author showed great talent in weaving a realistic story that doesn't &#34;haunt&#34; the reader.  The character Ma was so intriguing.  This book was well worth my time.
0684853523|5.0|My introduction to this book was when I was enjoying an afternoon at Barnes & Noble.  Someone was holding a class for aspiring writers right there in the cookbook section where all the comfy chairs are.  I was a little jealous as I was completely unaware that anyone could take a class that met at B&N.  I found out from one of the students as class broke up what the book and class were about.  I have never read a Stephen King book and I don't have any plans to read one in the near future.  I do, however, believe him to be an effective writer and someone who knows how to teach.  I have always been amazed at this book for its clarity.  If you want to know something you should be able to look it up and be able to understand it relatively easily.  That is how this book is.  There are concrete tools one can learn and use to become a better writer.  Stephen King lays it out straight.  The copy that I recently purchased is the fourth copy I've owned.  I can't seem to keep one on my shelf.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Hi there!  This edition has the superior sound quality, compared to all the others. It can be difficult to play the songs right away in your computer since it is an enhanced CD, and first you probably need to extract the audio files to a separate folder and if you wish, then burn it on a CD-R. All that can be easily done with a software like Roxio etc. However, if you intend to play it on your regular CD-player in your stereo set, no problems! So don't hesitate, there are absolutely no better sounding \\"Abbey Road\\"-edition than this one! Buy it!!!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This dvd is the best out there if your interested in global warming. Al Gore lays out the facts and photos for you to decide for yourself. Great DVD that everyone should see regardless if you believe global warming is real and human caused. My question to all non believers is why not fix our part even if you think it is small? If you think co2 is not bad then turn your car on and let it run with the garage closed (don't try). I think you will find co2 and other global warming gases are not the healthiest things to breathe. Imagine letting a cigarette slowly burn in a closed fishbowl while trying to breathe. The bowl is Earth and our smoking is slowly filling the bowl with terrible gases that will kill the life inside. Watch the dvd with an open mind and decide for yourself.
B002ZG99TK|3.0|Okay, let me describe Unstoppable. The plot is basic, the acting is secondary, and the whole semi-boring idea of a train on the loose kept me away from seeing Unstoppable in theaters until two weeks after its release. I watched it with a few of my relatives in town for Thanksgiving and everyone said that they enjoyed it, but it's one of those you can easily forget as soon as you make your way from the theater to your car. There will be little to no discussions afterwards, other than saying it was entertaining. I've seen plenty of movies where that alone is not a bad thing, though most don't have Denzel Washington in the lead role and cost over 100 million dollars. Denzel and Chris \\"Captain Kirk\\" Pine do share a couple of moments of good chemistry, on top of likeable performances. There are also some nice realistic action sequences mixed in with genuine moments of suspense. I'm going back and forth on a three or four star rating, but I think I'll have to take off a star for the sheer lack of depth. Still a fun ride worth catching.
0811876373|5.0|Beautifully photographed, easy to follow instructions on basics, and the cutest suggestions - even a normal person with a love for detail and fun can make these! wow - very smart author with heaps of creativity. love it!
0756405890|5.0|I've only recently been getting back into epic fantasy, having taken a long break from the genre. Over the past year, my results have been mixed. I've read some new stuff I liked, and some mediocre Extruded Fantasy Product. Some of the latter came highly recommended, so... I've started taking reviews with a grain of salt. Everywhere I read, people were praising Patrick Rothfuss's debut novel, The Name of the Wind. Nobody had a bad word to say about it. So, what the hell, I gave it a try.<br /><br />This was a GREAT story. I loved it.<br /><br />That said, I'd kind of call this \\"comfort fantasy.\\" Which is to say, it's not groundbreaking or even terribly original, and it's not edgy, gritty, or particularly dark, as is trendy in epic fantasy nowadays. The setting is your basic low-magic AD&Dish medieval kingdom, and the main characters literally meet in a tavern. Then the hero of the story, Kvothe, proceeds to narrate his life story, the story of a man who's climbed his way up from street scrub to bonafide Legendary Hero. Doesn't sound all that interesting? Well, even though it's long and sometimes the details are downright prosaic, it held my attention all the way through. It's like listening to a master storyteller (and Rothfuss is a master storyteller) tell a story you've already heard but which nonetheless keeps you waiting breathlessly for the next part. There are so many characters and events, all coming one after another, always something new happening. It's just a damn good read.<br /><br />However, this is the first part of a trilogy. By the end of the book, Kvothe has only gotten up to his University years; he's not even out of adolescence yet. So you have to wait for the next two books to find out how he really becomes a legend.<br /><br />All the recommendations didn't steer me wrong this time. I'll be looking forward to book two in the Kingkiller Chronicles.
B003O2RQKS|5.0|What a treat! An amazing performance. A lot has been written about Lang Lang unconventional performances and techniques. This performance is just a delight to listen to and to watch it. The camera shots are very creative and the sound beautifully reproduced. For less than $20 you can be in Vienna on the first raw. You can't go wrong with that. As Lang Lang matures, I hope to see him perform at additional concerts with more daring repertoire.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|All the elements of a WACK release. With all the guest appearances, and all the hype, Nicki has dropped her pink terd on the whole industry. The joke is on all of those that bought the album due to this is a drink coaster at best. The tracks are weak commercial pop beats, NO subject matter in the lyrics, AUTOTUNE, WEAK HOOKS, and most of the tracks are down right annoying. It was hard for me to make it through this album without grinding my teeth. Kanye's verse was probably the most enjoyable out of the whole album along with Eminem's verse. NIcki would have a more promising career in adult movies than rapping. I would avoid this album at all costs!!!
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I had waited so long for this to come out, I had forgotten much of the first 5 years content. It was not a dissapointment however. I watched it intently from start to finish. The series ended with great explination and full resolution. Very satisfying end, which I will not reveal or it would definitly ruin the surprise for avid followers of the series. This is something many of the TV series have not mastered, dropping a series mid plot without a good ending at all. Kudos for the writers, and for the TV networks on this one.
B003X2O6KW|4.0|This is a very creative, entertaining, lyrical album. From beginning to end the album bangs with dope beats and very good production. I almost want to say this release is better than his first album due to it doesn't have 1 million dumb skits as a filler like the first album does. What keeps this album from being a 5 is there a few corny lines that kanye threw in a couple of songs and there could have been a better choice in guest appearances (Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross). While the verses from Minaj and Ross weren't horrible, I still feel Kanye could have chosen some stronger, REAL emcees to replace them. Despite that this is a strong release and I recommend it for purchase!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've been whipping through these books, I can't put them down. So far, the first book is definitely the best. When I read the descriptive blurb on the show, I didn't think I wanted to read it, but enough people I know have enjoyed the books, so I decided to give them a try and am so glad I did.<br /><br />Don't let the blurb turn you off. Give the book a try.
B002VPE1X4|4.0|For 6.99$ how can you complain?! The case does exactly what it is designed to do. And that is protect your camera. It will fit any standard digital camera and will keep it safe while you are on the go. Its not the best looking case out but for the price how can you complain?!
B004B8RXQQ|3.0|Unlike some reviewers here, I loved this contemporary adaptation of Sherlock Holmes and hope we'll be seeing more in the future. And \\"The Great Game,\\" the third and final episode of the first season was the best of the lot.<br /><br />That being said, the downloaded version I purchased had absolutely terrible sound. The bass had been stripped away, giving even explosions a thin and tinny sound. And the midrange (where voices are) was so muddy that much of the dialogue was unintelligible.<br /><br />Note that I saw this episode on PBS and the sound was fine. And since getting my unsatisfactory download, I've found another copy which - again - had perfectly good sound.<br /><br />There are apparently no refunds for download purchases like this, so I highly recommend that you DO find and enjoy \\"The Great Game\\" (and the rest of the series)...but not the Amazon download. My 3 star rating is 5 stars for the program...and 1 star for the audio quality.
0743554450|5.0|I will not give you a synopsis of the book as there are so many here. I want to refute the Publisher Weekly's review of Ms. Leoni. I happened upon this audio book when browsing through a sale and thought it interesting. Listening to it on my way back and forth to work truly affected me. I think a big part of my reaction was Ms. Leoni's reading. Because she is of Afghan descent, her voice and intonations made the book/characters seem so real I felt a very strong connection to them and was totally engrossed in their story, hurting for their pain and rejoicing for their accomplishments. We forget how blessed we are but listening to this book will definitely remind you. I strongly recommend listening to it!
B002ZG976U|5.0|What a pleasant holiday weekend movie! The just released \\" Burlesque\\" written and directed by Steve Antin is just as predictable and traditional as a Thanksgiving dinner and just as good. You know how the story will end but that doesn't matter. Small-town girl leaves a nothing-job and goes to Los Angeles to make it big. And does she ever. Aging but ageless nightclub owner fights to keep her club open. Replaced entertainer gets vicious. Roommate becomes love object. Good triumphs over good business.<br /><br />Where the boys are first: It's easy to believe that Jack, bartender/musician/hump (Cam Gigandet) is someone a girl can fall for, assuming he's straight. Then there's Stanley Tucci who plays Sean, a similar character to what he did so well in \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\" But the women are the big winners here. Tess, the burlesque club owner is played by-- thanks to the miracle of plastic surgery, along with good living-- the ageless Cher who proves once again that though she is no Meryl Streep, she does certain parts very well indeed. And although in her mid-sixties, she can still sing a very soulful \\"You Haven't Seen the Last of Me,\\" which, by the way, could be the theme of her many goodbye tours. The movie belongs, however, to Christina Aguilera, brilliantly cast as Ali Rose, the girl from the cornfields who sets L. A. and the men in the club back on their heels. Can she ever both sing and dance as she does one great song after another. She will remind you at times of Marilyn Monroe. The film itself with all its precision dance routines is reminiscent of \\"Chicago\\" with a little bit of \\"The Birdcage\\" thrown in for the sake of diversity.<br /><br />Good acting, good one-liners, wild costumes, fantastic acting and singing, old-fashioned love story. Who could ask for more? The soundtrack ought to be a keeper as well.
B002GJT4XM|5.0|I love the Harry Potter DVD's and all the books. These have alot of information not on the regular DVD\\"s. Plus two versions, one has added sences. I really like the deal I recieved.
B00139W3NE|4.0|This movie surprised me.  Mixed reviews from co-workers and friends had me thinking this was going to be very mediocre.  Not at all.  The scenes and CGI were amazing!  I liked the story, but I did get a bit confused.  I think I will need to read the books.  But regardless, I was really looking forward to watching the rest of the series.  I figured I was late in watching this movie, but I'm sure I was on time for the next ones.  Boy was I surprised to find out that there were not going to be any sequels!  Way worse movies have had sequels made!  And in my opinion I did not think the first movie in \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" was better.  So it must be those religious zealots thinking they know what is right for the world.  Ironically in doing so, these Christians proved the author Pullman's point.  By the way, a lot of 1-star reviews I read on Amazon are due to the atheistic stance of the author.  Seems like a lot of them have not even seen the movie, which I thought protrayed evil much the same way Harry Potter movies do.  Another point for Pullman...  I'll just have to read the books then!
B002ZG99A4|5.0|Sly hits another homerun!!! The action in the expendables was over the top, dialog was bearable, and the cast far from EXPENDABLE!!! The best action movie ive seen in a while.  It certaintly wont win any oscars, but it was enjoyable and mindless fun. Besides most movies that win are pretty boring and dumb.  I found the extras on the blu-ray very interesting and it helped add a whole new appreciation for how they make a \\"real\\" action movie. They showed the toll shooting a action movie with real people can do to the body, Not like some movies with computerized action, ummmm Avatar, or Transformers ring a bell. The extras really made this a must have. Definitley my favorite movie in a long time, love the cast as always and cant wait for the sequel!!!
0061150142|3.0|Someone recommended this book and I decided to give it a shot, although I did not know anything about the book.  I was under the impression (maybe wrongfully so) that she wrote chick-lit.  A couple pages into the book and I realized this was no chick-lit!!  This is some serious stuff!  But it really reeled me in - I did not want to put the book down.  I enjoyed the different viewpoints and even the non-chronological order the story was told.  I felt the reactions of the parents in this awful circumstance was realistic.  However, about 50% into the book, I felt the story dragging.  I wanted more depth of Emily's character and her depression and her decision to commit suicide, but never got any of this.  SPOILER START - As Chris's story unfolded, I got even more confused.  He did not tell anyone about Emily?  He brought the gun even though he wanted to stop her?  He ultimately assisted, or actually killed, her??  The trial was a bit too dramatic and ultimately destroyed any sense of reality Picoult had created so well in the first half of the book.  The verdict was outrageous - Chris changes story three times and confesses to at least assisting in shooting Emily (all this without the defense of \\"mental illness\\") but he is still found 100% not guilty.  - SPOILER END  Because Picoult did such a great job with the first half of the book, I will try another book of hers.  I just hope the next one I try will go more in depth for the main character and not have ridiculous endings.  If so, then I prefer to read a true chick-lit - at least those stories are suppose to be silly!
0596806027|5.0|This book has'nt one bad chapter or even sheet or word. All the book worths the reading.<br />I learned from this 200 pages book more than with others with twice number of pages.<br />I hope other authors read this to learn to write better books.
B0043JDUNS|3.0|This movie is suprisingly more graphic than the first one, so I would think twice before letting your 10 year old watch this one.  Of course though, the first one is better I think, but this one definately has some cool things.  The ending was super cool in this one.  The thing that returns is Stark's home.  The gadgets and holograms just take my breath away.  That is how I wish technology was nowadays with touch screen holographic monitors and holographic touch fields of stuff.  But anyways, back to the movie.  I rate it 3 stars because it was more graphic than the first one, and most of the stuff is just a re-run.  Also, in the end (I don't want to give anything away), but it has him doing something to his life source and they never tell you really what it is good for, besides the effect you will see at the end).  I thought it was going to save the world, so we might be seeing an Iron Man 3, most likely we will since Spiderman saw a 3, and people really enjoy these comic book movies, so keep your eyes peeled for that one.
0198326769|5.0|I bought this book for my son to read in 8th grade. The condition was excellent. Delivery was prompt and he enjoyed the book.
0756656230|2.0|Very interesting, a book on lego history. Ok, let's get it. Seriously, I played with legos all throughout my childhood and even some today w/ my daugher. I got the books just so I could learn more about Lego history and look back on what themes I had growing up. Good for me to share with my daughter too, she can look at it and pass it on to her kids etc. Well there,s alot of incorrect info especially in the minifig book. I won't go into too many details but I think it was a waste considering I couldve got an actual lego set from when I was a kid, a good one like brand new never opened. I like the pictures though, thats pretty much it. At least my daughter don't care, she sees the pretty pictures. So if you're looking for good info on lego history, I wouldnt recommend this. Info in these books are from wikipedia or something.
0765326353|5.0|I think its funny how so many of you reviewers who scored this book negatively write that he has weak pros. While other actual WRITERS who have commented on this book have added nothing but praise. I prefer Sandersons writing style far more than other writers such as Jordan, who people have said is the superior writer. Say what you will about pros, Brandon Sanderson is head and shoulders above everyone else in the fantasy genre when it comes to the gift of story telling. No contest
B003UESJJC|5.0|I give this edition 5 stars for the time and effort FF Coppola invested in restoring the original Full Disclosure edition of these 3 films. This package is essential for its HD transfers, and the re-mastered audio. One segment that individuals who purchase this package, and who own a 5.1 or a 7.1 surround system must watch is a conversation with a Dolby Labs representative, explaining how home theater systems are misused- very interesting.<br />What stands out is how Apocalypse Now is Francis Ford Coppola's labor of love. With all of the delays in filming (detailed from issues involving Ferdinand Marcos, to Marlon Brando) the evolution of the film was a mirror of our governments involvement in Vietnam (sans the 50,000 + causalities).<br />If you are a fan of cinema, and you own a Blu-Ray player,  this needs to be on your shelf.
0545265355|5.0|I was fascinated by the concepts presented in the book.  It was good reading and made a person think. So, I would recommend them to readers who like \\"what if\\" kind of books.    I passed them on to two sisters who both enjoyed them.  Now they are in a library.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is the story of Dr. Horrible - a sympathetic aspiring supervillain vowing to save the world by conquering it - who records his persuit of global domination, his battles with his arch-nemesis, and his attempts to talk to the girl of his dreams at the laundremat on his video blog... while singing. What else do you need to know? This low-budget but very clever spoof on the classic comic book adventure is full of laughs and catchy tunes, espcially for fans of comic books, superheroes, and Joss Whedon (the lead writer). The beginning is a little slow, but it picks up right away with a sweet serenade to the girl he loves but can't talk to, and it keeps getting better from there. The characters are unusual but engaging, and have a great time turning the conventions of the superhero story on its ear. Short, sweet, and unpredictable - this is not a movie you see everyday.    P.S. Love this movie! Love the music! I listen to it everyday.    - Christopher Blieka 11/27/10
0465092764|3.0|I bought Peter Woit's book about two years ago.  In fact I bought it together with Lee Smolin's book on a similar subject, and read them both at the same time.  I loved this book, and I was at best lukewarm about Smolin's book.  Then I waited two years to write a review, because I wanted to wait until two of my sons learned enough physics to read these books too.  You see, I am a Ph.D. in physics, and these books are not written for me first and foremost, they are supposed to be for laymen.  I was sure that neither book was close to being understandable by someone who does not know any physics.  But I had high hopes that they would be somewhat understandable, and even entertaining to someone with an elementary introduction to physics.  In that I was not disappointed, and I learned a lot from my sons' points of view of what they though of these two books and particularly the ideas in them.     Based on what my sons thought, I suggest that you read chapter-1 of \\"Not Even Wrong\\", and then skip the next 9 chapters, and start reading again on Chapter 11, unless of course you have an undergraduate degree in physics.   In doing so, you skipped roughly half the book, but the stuff you skipped is not at all essential to understanding what was discussed in the second half of the book.  I think Peter Woit made a serious mistake in organizing the book.  He should reduce chapters 2-10 to appendices, and he should refer to them when relevant.     The material presented in Chapters 11 through 19 are extremely well written, and it was well understood by my sons (ages 16 and 18).  They found it very intriguing, amusing, and even sad and scary at times.  After reading the book, they had a million questions for me to answer about the physics content as well the human content.   Before they read the book, I had some (perhaps not very much) worries that they may be turned off from science (at least from physics.)  Quite the contrary, their scientific curiosity was much increased.  (Theolder son is now a college freshman studying physics of all things.)    I highly recommend Woit's book to all bright and scientifically minded high school and college students.  If you know nothing about physics however, don't waste your time.  Woit tries to teach you some physics on the fly, but most of it will fly over your head.  Similarly, I also recommend the book to all scientists if you have not already read it.  In this case, the chapters 2-10 might even be useful.    And Smolin's book?  Well, that's another story.  If you don't have a Ph.D. in physics and a keen interest in politics, I don't recommend it.  Maybe I will write a review about it some other day.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I work in 8th grade and i do a lot of young adult reading to keep up with what is new for the kids.  I decided to read this after all the talk i heard at work.<br /><br />I was blown away with the story.. after so many YA books this was like eating Filet Mignon after eating nothing but hamburg for a year.
B003YOMNCM|4.0|I'm a big fan of Jennifer Higdon's music. Hilary Hahn's performance of these pieces is hard to fault, and if you need to hear the Tchaik. one more time, this won't disappoint. Back to Higdon for a moment - I have not heard all she's done, but if you haven't heard Blue Cathedral, you really should (there's a TelDarc recording of the Atlanta Symphony playing this, with a number of other outstanding composers represented as well). The Higdon vln. concerto on this disc won the Pulitzer this past year. Higdon deserves it - she's a great example of how contemporary music can be saved from its own worst excesses. That's to say she's not afraid of a tune, of being tonal, of repeating a good idea. With all that said, her Concerto is not, for me, an entirely convincing work. The opening is absolutely magical, but the episodes that unfold thereafter don't add up to a satisfying whole. It's interesting, with this concern in mind, to hear the Tchaikovsky that follows. Even making allowances for the different vocabulary of his era and ours, there's just no getting around the memorability of the earlier work, and perhaps that's what I find wanting in Ms. Higdon's work, as represented here. If you're deciding whether to buy, however, I say go. Just pick up a copy of Blue Cathedral at the same time. Next time someone says they don't care for modern music, you'll be able to refer them to a masterpiece.
B004CA8YK2|5.0|Yes the album work is censored but this album is so amazing, it is so ridiculous. There is just no bad song on it!!!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I really enjoy this movie.  I don't think of Christmas without wanting to watch this movie.  funny, moving and great music.  song you can't get out of your head and I love hearing the song on the radio at Christmas time.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|A beautiful movie of a friendship between a man and his dog. The way they find together, the way they become friends and their loyalty to each other. Allbeit, I was a bit surprised to find out so little happened in this movie. At first, I expected some adventure to come, or something tragical, but the story is just a very common story with a very basic line. This doesn't make the movie any less though.<br /><br />Something I especially liked was the way this movie was made. The shots with the dog and the main actors are very clear, the music is just perfect, and the dog deserves an acting price. Richard was also well chosen for his role. The scenes with the dog following him to his work were very touching. Also the dog returning to his waiting place, I can't really describe the feeling it gave me. Such a deep friendship between the two.<br /><br />I hope you will enjoy this movie as much as I did. It's pretty simple in its story, not complicated at all, but yet it was so real. Certainly recommended.
B00003CXAE|5.0|This is an awesome dvd. In the condition I expected..played wonderfuly. and came faster than I thought it would. Thank You!!! I would buy from this seller again!!
B00275EHJG|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my son's B'day. I preordered and it arrived within a couple of days of the release.    The movie (as all of the Toy Story movies) is great. The big question is will there be further Toy Story movies?
B00428ZRFY|3.0|When it comes to pop stars, it's all about staying relevant. They all want the have the same career longevity as Madonna or Cher, as it's almost been proved impossible. Rihanna is right up there with them, releasing her fifth studio album in just five years of her career and less than a year after her previous studio effort. Now, I enjoy Rihanna's music, especially what I consider her best effort, 2007's \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\", but this time around, her new album feels rushed and emotionless.    Last year's \\"Rated R\\", failed to produce many major hits, with the major exception of \\"Rude Boy\\" (other singles fared well, but failed to make a huge impact), however it was a solid album that felt as if Rihanna only picked songs the she truly related to, and could make her own. You can tell with \\"Loud\\" that it's a different story, and it's pretty evident that this album is much more marketed towards having a few #1's and sell as many singles as possible. (The first two singles \\"Only Girl\\" and \\"What's My Name\\" have since charted at #2 and #1 on the Billboard Charts). Maybe this was a smart move money wise, considering money IS in the singles department nowadays *tear*, but it's sort of a tease to fans who have come to know Rihanna's solid pop albums in the past few years.    I remember hearing \\"Only Girl\\" for the first time in early September. I don't like to buy digital singles, but I was so attracted to the heavy synths and big dance beat that I could resist but download it. However, the rest of the album sounds nothing like it, which is possibly the biggest disappointment for me, although those who haven't been digging this whole dance music phase can rejoice. It's a further tease that the only song that sounds remotely similar is the opening one.     Onto the songs themselves, there's not much here to chose from. There is a range of styles in the mix, but they don't blend very well especially considering most of the songs themselves are quite weak. \\"S&M\\" is a great dance number in the vein of \\"Only Girl\\" but the overtly sexual lyrics will most likely turn many off. \\"Cheers\\" includes an Avril Lavigne sample, which could have worked if the song was better. \\"California King Bed\\" is a good ballad with a great chorus, but I seem to be in the minority in thinking this. \\"Man Down\\" is one of Rihanna's many songs about murder (is she trying to tell us something?) but it doesn't have the heartbreak of \\"Unfaithful\\", the anger of \\"Breakin' Dishes\\", the fear of \\"Russian Roulette\\", or the intimidation of \\"G4L\\". \\"Complicated\\" is a cute electro-pop song that would do well as a single. Finally, there is a version of \\"Love the Way You Lie\\" that tells the girls side of the story. Nice ending, but aren't we all a bit tired of that chorus?    The DVD included on the deluxe edition features her recording \\"Man Down\\" and \\"Raining Men\\", plus shows behind-the-scenes of her album photo shoot and the \\"Only Girl\\" video, and backstage at her Madison Square Garden show. The deluxe edition comes in an eco-wallet -a digipak without a tray- (like the original \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" album did) and the standard album just comes in a regular jewel case.     Highlights: S&M, Only Girl, California King Bed, Complicated
B004132I4S|2.0|I'm a fan, but on an initial listen, found it to be unpleasantly gimmicky in its use of electronica.  Nothing catchy or melodic enough to hold my interest.  Maybe it will grow on me.
B000002P5W|4.0|Hendrix' second release is in some ways a step beneath Are You Experienced; a mere stepping stone to his masterpiece Electric Ladyland, in my opinion, because of his inclusion of some filler tracks, and his yet to be perfected experimentation with crafting distortion and feedback into a musical idea. However, there are some tracks that show Hendrix' intricate command of the guitar, his artistic use of the studio, and his emotion-drenched passion in all of its love and glory.    For me, Spanish Castle Magic, Little Wing, Castles Made of Sand, One Rainy Wish, and Bold As Love are his best tracks of the set.  Spanish... rocks with Mitch Mitchell's tight drumming and Noel Redding's dead on bass. Little Wing, the achingly tender/sweet love song with a guitar accompaniment that guides you surely along with its enchantingly bold & beautiful melodic lead, yet carresses with delicate supplemental chords and notes dancing intricately into and around the lead, gives the feeling that lyrics are almost unnecessary. Castles... is another example of how Hendrix uses his guitar to dress his vocals in an intertwinement of melodic chords and riffs that emphasize the song's theme. One Rainy Wish's dreamy, idealic theme is interupted in the middle by a potent injection of a tunefully rockin' mix of a maxed-out guitar vertuoso and explosive lyrics, before it settles back into its dream-like reverie. Bold As Love- Forget it!  This piece bespeaks Hendrix' ambitious attempt to encapsulate the human dilemma in the raging drama and passion that captures Hendrix, the genius, at his artistic best.  There's no way to describe the band's onslaught into the song's final crescendo; the pagentry, the majestic expanse, the ever straining spiraling ascension to new heights...  You've got to hear it to believe it!    The album flips the bird to establishment in the typical 60's fashion (If 6 Was 9), and pokes jazzy fun at humanity (Up From the Skies). In conclusion, Axis paved the way for his stunningmasterpiece, Electric Ladyland, and gives glimpses into his later work on the album entitled Cry Of Love. Definitely worth the investment for those who wish to understand The Jimi Hendrix Experience.
B004D7LUWI|5.0|I almost don't know what to say about this episode.  It was freakin wicked good.  I didn't really think they could make an episode that would actually make me tense...but they did with this one.  The Darkside character is probably the best villain they could have come up with to end this series. Just alluding to this character made me tense.  Look...if you haven't seen a single episode of Smallville..you are missing a lot.  You need to start from season 1 epi 1 and work you way to here.  This is the best series on TV for pure storytelling.  If you don't like this series...then I don't know what entertainment means to you cuz this is entertaining.  Oh, and did I mention that the talented Tom Welling directed this episode!!!
4770031246|5.0|This is the best and most accessible bento box I've ever seen.<br /><br />Its for grown ups. Chucking out most of the cute bits and hard-to-find ingredients, this book is perfect for someone who wants to have a fun lunch but not make a scene in the breakroom because of a smiley face on a sandwich (not that there is anything wrong with that!).<br /><br />Most ingredients in the book are easy to find (cherry tomatoes, egg, chicken, etc), and some of the more specialized ingredients (mirin, dashi stock, etc) are available any almost any asian grocery store or online. There are tons of recipes, with pages followed by variations on those recipes, cooking time charts and timelines, and even a glossary of Japanese food terms. Fantastic.

B0002ZDVEU|5.0|In The Bourne Supremacy, Bourne's story that began in The Bourne Identity is continued, but it's more gritty. For one thing, there's a new director. Greegrass's style is a little more in your face than Liman's is. The Bourne Identity seems to have a detached feel, whereas Supremacy seems more in the here and now. Matt Damon, again, does an honest, direct portrayal of Jason Bourne.    What I like about the Bourne series is there is no Hollywood foolishness here. Unlike Bond, which is overflowing with coolness and charm, Bourne presents the world as it really is and has more soul. In Bourne Supremacy, the world is a dark and dangerous place, and there are bad people out there who are trying to kill you. But there are also good people who want to help you and you have to depend on those people to survive. For example, in The Bourne Supremacy, the whole CIA isn't bad. There are good and bad people in it. The characters are treated as individuals. Each character has depth and is explored, the good and the bad. Another good thing is that instead of killing off people like they are nothing, Jason Bourne tries to save as many lives as possible. He actually maintains a solid relationship with a girl instead of using her for sex. Overall, the movie is very mature and serious, but it also isn't overly depressing. Much of the movie is filmed in the overcast city of Moscow.     I want to stress that The Bourne Supremacy is not just an action thriller, but it is also a drama. In terms of character development, Bourne's relationships with people and their relationships with each other, The Bourne Supremacy is much more involved and complex than almost any action movie I've seen. Not only is the Bourne Supremacy a stylish thriller, but is also very philosophical, which is something you wouldn't expect from an action movie. It goes into questions of remorse and forgiveness, like when Bourne travels all the way to Moscow to apologize to a young Russian girl for killing her parents. Iwas very impressed with this movie. It deserves a lot of credit.
0374158460|5.0|This is Franzen's best book.  I see all the 1-star reviews as a sign he struck a nerve.  Read read read.
B000ERU5EK|5.0|I never write reviews, but I just have to say, get this album! You won't regret it. No matter what taste in music you have, this CD has a song for every mood you're in. I keep trying to decide what my favorite track is, but I can't. It's all based on my mood. Sometimes I like listening to the fast-paced beat of \\"World on Fire\\" or the soothing, relaxing \\"Home\\" or the dreamy \\"Alone Tonight\\" or the haunting \\"Liquid Love.\\" The only song that I don't like is \\"For All I Care,\\" but other than that, this album is perfect! The best music for driving your car as well. All I can say is, get it!
B001TOD92C|2.0|This movie was simply boring to me. I don't even understand what people mean by depressing, I didn't care about any of the characters to be that depressed, just bored and tedious by the same formulas used over and over again on every single drama that is of this type. Its simply teeth grindingly annoying. I fail to remotely see the appeal or what is even all that great about it.
B00000IZOR|1.0|I thought this was a great toy until I seen my almost 2yr old wrap the entire string around her little neck. I was worried about her harming herself and took it away. She can play with when she is old enough to understand the phone goes to your ear and not around your neck.
0553805371|4.0|The discussions about God in this book are a bit tedious.  They say, in effect, \\"Physics does not need God.\\"   One can't argue with this.  Any student of physics knows that a physics theory, or a physics explanation of any phenomenon, that invokes a deity, is not physics, and indeed, is not science.   So just ignore all the references or arguments given about God.    Anyone who wants a sane discussion of the relation between science and religion/theology by an eminent scientist should read Stephen Jay Gould's book \\"Rocks of Ages.\\"       Most of the rest of \\"The Grand Design\\" is to skim over, or ignore if, as is probable, you've seen it all before.  The illustrations are really lovely and, perhaps, instructive to look at.     However it appeared to me that the last two pages (180-181) may contain some real meat to chew on.  If I may be so bold as to paraphrase the argument made there the authors are suggesting that the creation of the universe needs only two postulates: 1) the universe was created out of nothing, i.e must have zero total energy and 2) the total energy of the universe must be conserved.  The universe thus created, the one we see, must, therefore, have a law of gravity.  For a theory of gravity to predict finite quantities the theory must have super-symmetry between the forces of nature and the matter on which they act.  M-theory is the most general super-symmetric theory of gravity and thus the only candidate for the theory of the universe - and so forth.  Remembering that Einstein's theory of special relativity required only two postulates I thought, maybe the old-boy has something up his sleeve here!
B004BSAEQC|1.0|This by far is the worst album I have heard in a long time. This album makes Lil Mama's album sound good. I just can't believe how bad it is I admit I am not a fan of hers but I figured I would check it out. I listened twice from start to finish and it was as bad the second as the first listen. I did not expect to be blown away but I expected way more than this. If you promote yourself as a rapper then make a rap album not a bad pop album. She has proved all her hater correct by dropping this album. I would save my money and buy Kanye West's album instead.

B000JQUKKU|5.0|Dickens is an expert storyteller, gripping both the imagination and emotions in a short story worthy of the title &#34;classic.&#34;  Early in the story the reader is introduced to Scrooge, a greedy and crude man who embraces money over people.  Dickens makes it easy to hate Scrooge while invoking some compassion on this horrible soul.  The mixture of both hatred and pity shows the genius of the author.  With the visit of the long deceased partner of Scrooge, Scrooge sees the tormented ghost and faces what he may become if he does not change his ways.  With the horror of the moment, Scrooge is informed of three ghosts who will visit Scrooge, in order that Scrooge may not suffer the same fait of his former business partner.  The three ghosts visit showing Scrooge the joy of Christmas had been, the happiness and good some enjoy in the current Christmas despite their humble and afflicted estate and the terror of his future.  Each ghost offers their own terror but all the while offering hope that a changed Scrooge could change an even scarier future.  The story will grip you if you can overlook some of the tangents by Dickens and some of the old customs included in the book.  If you have a tendency towards emotional reactions to a good book, you may want to prepare yourself before reading this book.  Every reader should read this book at least once and then you will understand what is meant by a Dickens Christmas.
006145205X|3.0|Matt Ridley is a very erudite person whose intelligence can be found on every page of his book, The Rational Optimist. Unfortunately, however, he is biased, particularly against government, religion and environmentalists. This bias shows in his stating opinions as facts. For example on page 192 he writes, \\"Since human beings are just another kind of animal...\\" Well there are a lot of people in the world who would disagree.  His view of governments is that they might be necessary in the beginning, but they become oppressive over time. When Ridley sticks to his main argument, that specialization and trade have led to a steady improvement in the human condition, he is on firm ground. He displays a vast knowledge of history and makes a number of thought-provoking points. His arguments against biofuels and the increasing reliance on renewal sources of energy are good examples. He also uses a rich vocabulary--probity, apotheosis, eutropic, dirigiste, mortise, etc.<br /><br />The book is well worth reading, but cannot be viewed as objective.
0971407614|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I like the thought of being able to exercise any time, any place, without requiring special equipment. I liked the wide variety of exercises that were available. I thought the categories that he broke the exercises into were quite good. The exercises are good, all-round workouts, and I was amazed how much of my body I was able to exercise at one time using the routines recommended. I thought the nutrition guidelines were good, if a little simplistic.    That said, I do have a few quibbles with the book. The first is that while he claims all of these exercises can be adjusted downward for beginners, he did not do this. A few of them had suggestions that would allow beginners to do them, but most of the suggestions to make them easier still left them as fairly tough exercises. The beginner routine was exhausting, and there is no way the majority of middle-aged adults I know could possibly do this. I was left wondering if Mr. Lauren simply never interacts with anyone but special ops forces. I would encourage him to go down to the local Walmart and look at the people there and come up with exercises that they could do.    The second is that while the title says this is a book for men and women, the exercises were clearly geared toward men. There was a huge emphasis on upper body exercises that most women I know would not be able to do.    I was also a little frustrated that he completely dismissed cardiovascular exercise. Most fitness experts I know disagree with this, and he offered no evidence for what is a fairly controversial position.    That said, if you are already in reasonably good shape, this is a great book to help you take it to the next level.

B004498KPU|5.0|I just got my Vision DVD and I am very very happy.  This is watching the master at work!   Just beautiful.  All his great short films all in one package with bonus never before released videos.  What else can I ask for?  All the videos are high quality, very clean and bright and the sound is great also.  You will enjoy all the long version short films as BAD, Smooth Criminal, TWYMMF, Black or White, The Prison version of TDCAU is included and the lyrics are unedited with a disclaimer, but I love that I get to hear it as it was intended.  One More Chance is very cinematic and has a cool concept- I'm sure it wasn't quite finished, but it still looks great!  The graphic intro to every song is first rate!   I am so grateful to have this treasure to keep forever.  Michael is gone but he left us these amazing pieces of work to enjoy for the rest of our lifes.  Thank you Michael, I love you more!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I have always found movies and tv shows to be loyal friends. I have grown up with many of them, cried over them, laughed at them, and, more than anything, have wanted to belong to them. It is clear from the beginning that the writers and creators of Community know exactly how I feel. In one of Jeff Winger's first lines (the pitch perfect Joel McHale) he mentions that he was raised by tv and Abed, a young guy with a passion for film and television that borders on obsession (who shows some traits common in Asperger's patients) often calls to attention the clich&eacute;s that movies say would happen in whichever situation they are. The whole show is filled with inside jokes for us, like complaining about how characters on tv shows break the suspension of disbelief by remarking how much their lives resemble tv shows, or openly discussing shows which feature actors on Community. They use the TV formulas, like the will they - won't they sexual tensions, or the group of misfits who become a family, and mock them, while at the same time putting them into play. For all its references and parodies, Community never stops being entertaining. No matter how hard they try to remind us that it's just a show, it still makes you wish it were real.

0451196716|1.0|I consider myself one of King's Constant Readers, but, I had no time for the likes of The Long Walk.  The premise alone was ridiculous so maybe that is why this whole story did not appeal to me.  This story is not worthy of King's name. ( He wrote this novel under the pseudonym Richard Bachman.)  I read about one half of the book then simply skipped pages to the end.  This is what I do when one of my favorite authors writes what I consider a \\"dud\\".  Of course it will remain as part of my collection but he has written many, many better novels.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Rhetorical question. I know what happened. The studio's weenies got cheap. They gambled that they didn't need to pay him his fair share. They were wrong. I, & many others, didn't go to the theater to see this. We didn't buy the DVD, either. I only rented this for 99 cents. How much of that are they going to get? Not going far on that, weasels. What did they do? They retained most of their stolen money, & went w/Skellboy... What's his name, Rooney? The guy is a skell. I'm sorry. He did an OK job w/The Wrestler. He's not a real actor, though. He's a skell. That hardly makes up for it. Back to Terence's end. I like Don. This was Terence's role, though. His absence showed.     Some people bashed this film. @the end of the day? It aint rocket science. It's Iron Man. It was a good, entertaining plot. The Hughes' hearings were a nice touch. Skydiving is always cool. The Monaco GP, & final fight was kick_A*s. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Would I let the studio make money off it? No. They got what, fifty cents off my rental? That's a bit less than $20+ @the theater, or $18 for a DVD. Most of what they slap together nowadays is Caca, anyway. I rarely go to the theaters anymore. Oh Yeah, last thing. I watched the trailer. It shows Pepper kissing Tony's (removed) helmet, & then pitching it out the open jump door. That scene was deleted during the editing process. You think maybe you want to only use finished footage in your trailer??? I guess they saved some money on the trailer, too. Good. The money is drying up, fatties. Most of what you make is garbage. It gets boot-legged almost immediately. It then gets pirated all over the Net :-). You lard as*es might have to actually work for a living one day.

B0042RUMG4|2.0|As with many I was very very curious as to what this album would end up being. Of course it's hard to evaluate this without understanding it's his first album since his whole bit with the Beyonce/Taylor Swift debacle and would doubtless exist in the shadow of that controversy. Kayne has promised a lot for this,a musically and conceptually lofty album that would explore his psyce and observations of what was happening around him during the time he was making it. Of course it also happened to coinside with the release of a 33 minute short film based on the song \\"Runaway\\" which not only signaled the comeback but also his intent to move forward in this respect. As for the music itself I have a number of questions. Musically this album is not so much a collection of seperate songs but a return to the idea of full lengh hip-hop albums connected by an orchestral theme that resembles nothing so much as Marvin Gaye,Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield's early 70's conceptual cinematic soul releases. On some of the songs the vocorder-like vocal enhancement is laid on thickly and when Kayne sings rather than raps.....well he's still weak in that area. But that is not the key to this albums flaw. Lyrically this album represents Kayne breaking down himself and his thought processess in terms of dealing with his sexuality and viewpoint on how he's been dealt with in the public the last several years. Apparently he's very angry and bitter because the amount of obsenity in language and shallow \\"locker room talk\\" detracts from the power of the album message. That plus the level of vitreol and negativity with which his delivers this \\"private sermon\\" as it were tends to make for a rather offputting listen. Over the years it's been hard for me personally to relate to the majority of hip-hop because even when there's a conceptually and musically rich a project such as this that comes out of it,and there have been many even that I haven't heard the harshness with which it's delivered confuses me. Of course I picked up the deluxe edition of this album for the basic reason it included a DVD featuring the \\"Runaway\\" mini movie,in which the albums musical concept comes to a far better fruitation because,for one the language is SIGNIFICANTLY toned down to focus on the concept. In this film Kayne is depicted rescuing a Phoenix-like woman during a comet collision and through a series of images included a feast,a ballet and others the story of how we often try to change what we see that's different around us. For that alone it's a five star set: the two stars I give this review has nothing to do with the music which is very deep and powerful but rather for the somewhat adolescent lyrical focus which,to my ears sucks all the life from the album and makes most of it a session of often hostile posturing. I know not everyone will share this opinion but considering what it promises the lyrical focus just sells the whole project a bit short.h it's delivered confuses me.

B003X2O6KW|5.0|this album is the essence of progressive hip-hop. The reinvention of a lost art, which is making good music without contradicting who you are. Kanye is who he is, plain and simple. We might not like him at times, but he none the less comes out with great music production wise and lyrically. Simply brilliant
B001UV4XFG|5.0|As an older reader, I was surprised by my intrigue with the Twilight book series, but it is really phenomenal.  The Eclipse movie is by far the best of the three in keeping in sync with the book.  I was very disappointed with the first Twilight, but my opinion raised with the second one.  NOW...I was really excited to see the detail and cinematography with the Eclipse movie.  I saw it several times at the theater (going with different friends who wanted to see it) and I never got bored. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in this series.  You will not be sorry.
1595141715|5.0|To start, I will admit - I've only read the bad reviews on this book.  I chose not to read the good reviews yet, fearful that my own views would be tainted and thus, I would not be able to review this book properly.      ***Please be warned, there are some spoilers***    When I began to read the book, the more I read, the angrier I became at Hannah for being so selfish and blaming everyone else for her suicide by the use of the cassette tapes.  By the end of the book however, I realized something - and I'm not sure if many others have already stated what I'm about to state - but my hope is that I do bring in a somewhat new perspective.      By the end of the book, I finally realized that Hannah did not specifically leave the tapes to be cruel and torture those, who critics have said, she blamed on for ending her life - in fact, she blames no one but herself, and she knew what she was doing was a selfish act.  She only uses the excuse of telling each individual that they had a part in her suicide purely to have them do exactly what she needed them to do - listen.  Because her final act was not purely to hurt those she talked about on the tapes (although I'm sure it was a small part) but to (I apologize for the cliche)set the truth free and have them face the reality that we are capable of murder in any form:  physically, emotionally, mentally, and/or spiritually.  And some of us are just not strong enough to withstand that kind of pain without help.  And some of us are just not strong enough to ask for that kind of help.     First, I believe that Hannah used the tapes to reveal certain truths that could have been prevented had she or someone else done something about it.  Truths that couldn't stay hidden or else more people could get hurt.  Even though Hannah admits to being a coward and not doing anything, at least by leaving the truth behind, she gives the opportunity to those who are listening to be a better person, and thus in her own way, attempt to rectify somefuture wrongs.      Second, I believe that Hannah needed to show the people she talked about on the tapes, how much of an impact a careless word or act could be.  And we've all experienced it as well as committed it - How many have ever had someone say to them: \\"Your breath smells\\" or \\"You talk funny\\" or \\"Your laugh is so weird\\", random phrases like that, and it changed you?  Many can laugh it off or not care - but for those who do care?  Suddenly you start to carry breath mints, or stop talking, or muffle your laughter.  And you become self-conscious of yourself of which you had never noticed before - until someone, generally someone whose opinion matters to you - points it out.  This is exactly what happened to Hannah Baker - but it was not a simple physical defect that other teens were pointing out to her - it was her entire being they had made defective - and eventually, an object unworthy to even think about.  How does one survive when being new to a town and starting off with a reputation that has everyone stare with judgment?  No established friends and no established support for a still maturing mind - when faced with such negativity for 3 straight years, are we truly surprised at the negative outcome?  Don't we all have a breaking point?    I believe, all in all, the true meaning of this book is to show how much power we have.  The power to heal as much as the power to tear down.  And the power to really listen and really look at others and find the signs in time to fix what could have spiraled into \\"too late.\\"
B000UO7IM4|5.0|When he signed with Columbia and began recording on Halloween of 1962, 46-year-old Thelonious Monk already had a successful musical career behind him (including well-documented stints with Blue Note and Riverside).  Because the Columbia albums mostly popularized Monk's older tunes, they were dismissed by some hardcore jazz fans as safe and predictable -- but that criticism should not scare off anyone curious about this much-praised musician who is thinking of giving the Original Album Classics boxed set a try.  Monk did not sell out to go mainstream with Columbia.  He just took advantage of the fact he'd lived long enough and shaped music to such a degree that his art had become commercially viable.    I think these recordings are the best entry point to Monk's music.  First, the sound quality is much better than what you'll encounter on Monk's ground-breaking albums from the 1940s and 1950s.  Second, Monk's genius did not rely on physical tricks, so age did not undermine his performing ability the way it does for many musicians.  Third, Monk made these recordings with his working band, so the interplay is tight and sympathetic.  Finally, both fans and critics of tenor saxophonist Charlie Rouse seem to agree that he was able to craft nicely rounded and technically proficient solos fully consistent with the overall Monk sound -- which is especially useful if you're first coming to understand what Monk was all about.    The boxed set includes the following:    1) Monk's Dream - Monk's 1st Columbia studio album, and reportedly his best seller -- recorded 31 Oct thru 6 Nov 1962 -- leaving aside alternate takes, the album includes 5 Monk compositions by quartet, 1 standard by quartet, and 2 standards with Monk on solo piano.    2) Criss Cross - Monk's 2nd Columbia studio album -- recorded 6 Nov 1962 thru 29 March 1963 -- leaving aside alternate takes, the album includes 8 Monk compositions by quartet, 1 standard by piano trio, and 1 standard with Monk on solo piano.    ...skips \\"It's Monk's Time\\" (3rd Columbia studio album, recorded 29 Jan thru 9 March 1964) and \\"Monk.\\" (4th Columbia studio album, recorded 9 March thru 8 Oct 1964)...    3) Solo Monk -- recorded 31 Oct thru 2 Nov 1964 -- as the title suggests, it's Monk on solo piano, mostly playing other people's songs (some popular and some obscure) but with a few original compositions.    4) Straight, No Chaser -- recorded 14 Nov 1966 thru 10 Jan 1967 -- leaving aside an alternate take, includes 4 Monk compositions by quartet, 2 other numbers by quartet, and two tunes on solo piano.  Includes an uptempo, bluesy version of the title track that clocks around 11:30 ... great fun.    5) Underground -- Monk's final small-group session for Columbia -- recorded 14 Dec 1967 thru 14 Feb 1968 -- notable for introducing four new Monk compositions, more than any of the other Columbia albums -- At time of release, the music received less attention than the cool album cover showing Monk surrounded by weapons and revolutionary symbols.  By this point, traditional jazz was growing stale, but Monk resisted all the gimmicks that other musicians used to attempt to breathe life into their music.  He just released another great album following his usual formula (with the exception of bringing in vocalist Jon Hendricks for the rerecording of \\"In Walked Bud\\").  He ended where he began: Stuck in the musical underground because he insisted on doing his own thing.
0553385461|5.0|a good introduction into the realm of modern physics, including me! It's really a good book, and if you find reading \\"a brief history of time\\" or any other book concerning the subject (i'm talking about the physics stuff) difficult to understand, this might serve as an introductory or reference on the underlying principle (the basics),all in all, a really good book!
B003NWS5AO|3.0|In typical fashion I went back to the beginning, Led Zeppelin's 1969 debut, and listened to every album in sequential order leading up to \\"Band Of Joy\\". I did this to put \\"Band Of Joy\\" in perspective, and to also hear how Plant has changed over the years.<br /><br />\\"Band Of Joy\\" is a close cousin to 2007's \\"Raising Sand\\" in approach, production and overall sound. It is not a major departure from \\"Raising Sand\\" and it is not quite as good as that album. Plant draws inspiration here from many different sources, but mainly keeps with country/folk, blues and some alternative rock. There appears to be only one original track written by Plant and co-producer Buddy Miller, and that is \\"Central Two-O-Nine\\", which I'd swear is not an original song, and reminds me somewhat of Johnny Cash's \\"Like The 309\\" from his 2006 album \\"American V: A Hundred Highways\\".<br /><br />\\"Band Of Joy\\" opens in unusual style with a cover of Los Lobos' \\"Angel Dance\\" from their 1990 album \\"The Neighborhood\\". Good, not great. It grew on me with repeated listens. Richard and Linda Thompson's \\"House Of Cards\\" from their 1978 album \\"First Light\\" is also good, but nothing fantastic. \\"Central Two-O-Nine\\" is catchy, but not completely memorable. It is alternative rock band Low's \\"Silver Rider\\" from their 2005 album \\"The Great Destroyer\\" that finally finds Plant in his element--melancholic, meditative and melodically memorable all in one. Billy and Bobby Bobineaux's \\"You Can't Buy Me Love\\" as originally performed by Barbara Lynn Ozen, a female African American guitarist, in 1965, is one of the most obscure tracks here, and it's just okay. Equally obscure is gospel singer Dillard Crume's \\"Falling In Love Again\\" which I could not locate at all. Good, not great.<br /><br />The second half of \\"Band Of Joy\\" opens with the excellent \\"The Only Sound That Matters\\" written by Milton Mapes, from his 2003 album \\"Westernaire\\". Again, Plant in his element here with a lilting, longing song of yearning for something more. Low's \\"Monkey\\", also from \\"The Great Destroyer\\" is just as moving as \\"Silver Rider\\", and another song that highlights Plant's strengths as an interpreter. The traditional song \\"Cindy I'll Marry You Someday\\" is a paint-by-numbers folk tune that barely registers. Townes Van Zandt's apparently unpublished poem \\"Harm's Swift Way\\" is another strong track, with Plant turning in another fine performance. The other traditional track, \\"Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down\\" is okay. Poet Theodore Tilton's \\"Even This Shall Pass Away\\" is a great track to end \\"Band Of Joy\\"<br /><br />So, six out of twelve tracks are great, and the other six are just fine. There's nothing offensive here, and there are a few tracks that strike a chord, but overall the album is just pleasant, just like \\"Raising Sand\\". I respect Robert Plant for not re-hashing Led Zeppelin every album, and for being adventurous musically throughout the course of his career, and for not pandering to a younger crowd just to get sales. It's just that \\"Band Of Joy\\" isn't very adventurous musically, but what it does have is a quality of intimacy and maturity with some bleak subject matter.<br /><br />Here is how \\"Band Of Joy\\" compares to Plant's previous works:<br /><br />1969 Led Zeppelin: Three and a Half Stars<br />1969 Led Zeppelin II: Five Stars<br />1970 Led Zeppelin III: Three and a Half Stars<br />1971 Led Zeppelin IV: Five Stars<br />1973 Houses Of The Holy: Five Stars<br />1975 Physical Graffiti: Five Stars<br />1976 Presence: Four Stars<br />1979 In Through The Out Door: Five Stars<br /><br />1982 Pictures At Eleven: Four Stars<br />1983 Principle Of Moments: Three and a Half Stars<br />1984 The Honeydrippers: Three and a Half Stars<br />1985 Shaken 'N Stirred: Four Stars<br />1988 Now And Zen: Five Stars<br />1990 Manic Nirvana: Four Stars<br />1993 Fate Of Nations: Five Stars<br />1998 Walking Into Clarksdale: Three Stars<br />2002 Dreamland: Three and a Half Stars<br />2005 Mighty Rearranger: Four Stars<br/>2007 Raising Sand: Three and a Half Stars<br />2010 Band Of Joy: Three and a Half Stars
B003L77TZI|4.0|Katy Perry - Teenage Dream<br />7/10 AKA 3.5/5<br /><br />Great overall vibe to the album. Really cool how her and the production/songwriting team pull off a retro feel yet with modern stylings. Also good at being the processed pop album that it is.<br /><br />Teenage Dream and The One That Got Away both emphasize that retro feel.<br />Other song-by-song comments: California Gurls, Last Friday Night (one of my new favorite drinking songs), Firework (inspirational. the singing's a bit labored, but not as bad as live performances of it), Peacock (cheeky humor), Circle The Drain, ET, Pearl (maybe). The rest aren't _bad_ though.<br />Yeah, the title track gets the better of the two included remixing jobs.
B0045DO8NI|4.0|My only grief is the absence of \\"God is a DJ\\"...    Other than that, I think they weight too much on the album Funhouse; even though all the Funhouse songs here are great (except I personally don't like \\"So What\\"), \\"I Don't Believe You\\" is somewhat weak, so as the new song \\"[...] Perfect.\\"  \\"Glitter in the Air\\" is an amazing song by the way, I don't know what the fuzz is about..
B0013ND30W|5.0|I'm honored to have this film on blu-ray. It is the most elaborate animated movie ever made, almost ten years in the making, and it shows. The remastered sound makes it feel like you're actually in the woods or at the castle with the characters. Every frame is artwork (Many thanks to Eyvind Earle and the rest). I can never get enough of it. If you have a blu-ray player, I strongly recommend you give Sleeping Beauty a try. It is the definitive Disney viewing experience.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|If you purchased this album, most likely you are already a Kanye fan and don't need a review, but for anyone who hasn't heard Kanye's music, here is a chance to hear his original sound at a time when it seems that he may make an album with low impact.  Surprise, Kanye does it again and brings his samples, cognitive lyrics and fresh beats.  I don't know how anybody can't enjoy this music.  Say what you want about the man, but the music can't be beat. five stars doesn't do this album justice.
B0043KK4N6|4.0|the only reason i don't give this cd a 5 star is, i wish cher had a few more songs on it!! christina aguilera sounds great! singing+belting out the songs high+mighty!! like you know she can! cher sounds great on the 2 songs she gets to sing too!!! if your a fan of theirs. you'll like this cd!! no uro-dance crap on this soundtrack just great belt it out singing!!!! from 1 of the  great movie musicals since \\"chicago\\"
B000W1U75U|5.0|Without question, the $4,99 I spent for Bryter Layter is the absolute best 5 dollars I have ever invested!  I stumbled onto Nick Drake while listening to the haunting melody and lyrics at the end of the movie \\"Serendipity\\".  As \\"Northern Sky\\" played, I searched the movie soundtrack list to identify the song and Artist.  The joy that I experienced in identifing the artist of that great song was almost immediately destroyed by the realization that Nick Drake had died over 35 years ago. What a loss.  Luckily, Nick Drake left this and a handful of other albums for us to enjoy. I have already identified the Nick Drake Boxed Set as my next purchase.
0920668372|5.0|This book was written and illustrated beautifully!  I first read it at my daughter's open house at high school.  Her English teacher handed it to me while we were waiting for the other parents to get there.  At first I was confused and didn't understand but by the time I was at the end of the book I was like the other person who reviewed it and had a lump in my throat and was holding back the tears (because of all the other parents in the room)!  I told my daughter afterwards to tell the English teacher to never do that to a mother again!!  The person with the review of \\"Disturbing Book\\"; number 1) is not a mother, number 2) forgot what it was like to think like a child (this is a children's book, after all) and number 3) may not have had the best relationship with his mom.  Although it is a sad book, it really can be how things turn out in real life (although far fetched for the childs point of view).  I am a nurse and work in a nursing home.  To Disturbed; this book happens all of the time!  I see so many sons (as well as daughters) who stick by their mothers even when their mothers no longer remember them because of dementia or Alzheimer's Disease.  Although mother-daughter relationships are wonderful, there is something about a sons' love for his mother that is truly special and unique.  I hope my son feels the way the book portrays for me someday, because I certainly feel that way for him today!
B004AQR29C|4.0|I just watched it and to be honest, there was so little story that I couldn't tell you what it was about other than there was an island  with a girl to be saved by a group of American Mercenaries.  I enjoyed it though - it was a totally violent action movie.  There was a lot of gunfire, explosions, and knife throwing.  There was a lot of graphic violence and tough guys.  The action and fighting were well choreographed and executed, with some nice martial arts sequences.  It was fun to watch.
0446343129|2.0|If you want a complete history of \\"sugar,\\" then buy this book (I should have rated it 5 stars for historical background).  If you are looking for a practical way to cut sugar from your diet, look elsewhere.
1557048630|5.0|My boyfriend aspires to work for PIXAR within the next few years, so I always get these Art of books for him so that he can study the illustrations and processes of his favorite animated films.  He insists that these are the best resources for people outside of the animation industry to get to learn about how these films are made.  We particularly enjoyed \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\" more than we usually do with Dreamworks films.  We definitely agree that this is their best of their animated movies.  PIXAR still dominates, though.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|I bought this for my nephew who is 4 months old and is really starting to like grabbing and playing with toys.  Covered in bright, captivating colors and a variety of fun textures, it is about 8 inches across, so it's not too large or overwhelming for the baby to maneuver around.<br /><br />Sir Prance A Lot (the knight) has a squeaker inside his head and is covered in a soft, fuzzy blue and green polyester fabric.  There is also a clip on top of his head so that the toy can be attached to a stroller or car seat.  The horse is mostly covered in a shinier, more satin-like fabric.  There are also ribbon \\"tags\\" for his mane and lining the edge of the \\"blanket\\" underneath his saddle.  The crinkle material that my nephew loves so much is located in the hooves and under the saddle blanket, and there is a bell inside the horse's head.  Two plastic rings make up the tail of Sir Prance A Lot's horse.<br /><br />It arrived in a sealed plastic bag, so it was well protected from the rain and snow.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|Ben Affleck followed up the grossly underrated \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" with \\"The Town,\\" which is a fantastic movie.      I have no idea how the audio / video will be on BluRay, as my only viewing was in theaters.  Without a doubt, this is a great movie, if you love gangster genre films.  The love story aspect was decent.  The car chases, plot, and armed robberies are what really made this great.       Highly recommend this movie!!!
0718154770|5.0|Great book - really condenses his simple form of cooking into practical quick meals (though most of his meals are easy and quick to make).  Still the best chef around!
B000SXOI66|5.0|Grants choice:Best Album release EVER!Always been my favorite from first time I heard it.I understand some people dont even like it.cant speak to the quality on this particular release but Ive had it in about 10 formats...gotta be better than the eight track with a little matchbook folded up and tucked under 1 corner.Its Dark Side Of The Moon
0316098337|2.0|Hey there. Are you the person who throws out the 1 and 5 star reviews and reads the 4's - 2's? Me too. So this review is for you.<br /><br />Let's begin with one question: what is a story?<br />A story (loosely described) is a series of escalating conflicts that result in a climax and ultimately a resolution of some nature.<br /><br />I knew I was not in good hands about 30% into the story.<br /><br />While her prose is decent, and the quirk of writing from the POV of the 5 year old boy not quite as gimmicky as it sounds, the story is a short story, not novel length. I was initially intrigued by the writer's story and wondered just what the hell was going on...but then after going through the boy's days about 20 times...it was clear the writer was simply thinking of \\"what different things could I do, if I were trapped in a room?\\" and not TELLING A STORY.  It get's monotonous, fast.<br /><br />Many people complained about the escape scene, I thought it was okay. I can stretch my disbelief in that area, just fine.  Where I can't is that Jack, the young boy in the book, seems so maladjusted.<br /><br />And he has a TV.<br /><br />That's the biggest problem.  The writer should have never put a television in the room. You see, TVs are what train most people's kids whether they like it or not. Kids learn life lessons, they learn how to treat others, they learn how to talk to other people, etc.  But the writer seemed to forget this and made Jack into some kid who couldn't determine if someone was speaking directly to him or someone else...unbelievable. To the extreme.<br /><br />Also, once the escape is over....THE STORY IS BASICALLY OVER...if you are looking for some excitement, or some interesting twist later in the book, there is none. The writer just starts following Jack on very boring days of him experiencing things over and over and over and over and over again. Look, I've had three kids, I know the routine, it's really not that interesting to see this kid learn new things. Sorry.<br /><br />The problem is, the writer put the climax in the middle of the book. The last half is just resolution...there is no more story, there is no more conflict to drive the story forward.limax in the middle of the book. The last half is just resolution...there is no more story, there is no more conflict to drive the story forward.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this converter. I'd read personal reviews from so many people either loving or dissing the product. I'm a longtime FragFX user but after repeated purchases due to contollers breaking or failing for one reason or another I was willing to try something different. Thanks to Prime I had the Eagle Eye in two days and started working with it. It was clear from the begining this thing was worth the money.     The good:  it just works and works well.  Simple to get setup and nice long USB cord.     The not so good:  programming takes work and patience. For most the default key mapping would work fine, but people looking for customization need patience in the beginning.     Other thoughts:  I would have liked better communication between the controller and the software. The prompts don't really instill confidence that the device took your changes. Also, they released an updated firmware and I updateded to device. Took a while but completed successfully.  With the new update comes new software for button configuration as well. It looks good but I prefer the original software as it seems more reliable.
B003K07DUC|4.0|Great acting and story.  Sound effects and loads of action.  Fast pace with lots of aerial footage.  Really takes you to Iraq.
B0041T52S6|5.0|Well I'm sure some people are going to think this is a cheesy movie and it is, but it was a lot of fun.  I really enjoyed the movie.
1569242739|5.0|I've dabbled and struggled in veganism over the years. My family has been resistant, to say the least but with this little cupcake book under my belt I think the journey will be much easier and more enjoyable for everyone. The ingredients, for the most part, are ones you can find in any regular grocery store and the finished products fooled my toughest and most anti-vegan critic...my husband. The rosewater pistachio cupcake is amazing!
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I was so excited when I saw that this new Ken Follett novel eas coming out. I was looking into buying an e-reader at that time. Glad that I bought a Nook instead of a Kindle I was able to check this out through my local library. If i bought a Kindle I would not have been able to do this. I really did not want to spend the ridiculous $19.99 for the Kindle edition of this.  Boring charachters  Repeatative  Do not waste your time or money.  Never even finished it was so bad.
1439163146|5.0|I loved this book but I expect that it is not for everyone.  Franco seems to be relying on the ghosts of Hemingway and Salinger, and at first I found that technique off-putting, but the more I read, it began to come together and I realized that this little book is a masterpiece.  It may seem that Franco is writing about nothing and that his narrative voices are devoid of emotion, but the emotion that seems to be absent is actually teeming under the surface.  These stories are ultimately about cruelty, about happenstance and accidents, the beauty and stupidity of youth.  I can't wait to read more.
B003OF3R0S|4.0|Good album following the loss of Rev. This is definitely an album any Avenged 7 fold fan should have. There is no drop off in musicianship or creativity.
B000002U82|5.0|I'm afraid I can't express my absolute love, appreciation and adoration for this album though Amazon reviews. But thankfully, others ARE able to do so.    While I am here though, I'd like to point out that the majority of users giving this album 1 pathetic star, are simply doing so, for the sake of giving it one star. Users, that've probably never listened to music with artists playing their own instruments, or writing their own lyrics, users that hate to see something they cannot understand become so loved and admired by others, users, that simply want to be irritating, and contribute to the scar and puss that is bad Amazon reviews.     Not that I want to generalise or anything..
0756665949|2.0|First off, let me explain that this is a coffee table book, plain and simple. It is hardly encyclopedic and exhaustive like I had expected. Every page is crammed full of large photos and the text is squeezed in the left over space as an afterthought. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with pictures, but why do they have to dominate the entire thing? I wanted an encyclopedia with lots of information and painfully detailed entries. Instead, they delivered an excersize in photoshop. When I actually saw this thing, I was really surprised how tall and thin it was. I was expecting something squat and fat, more along the lines of a dictionary. The proportions further emphasize the coffe-table-bookedness of this thing.     If you already own this book and enjoy it, then I do not mean to take away from your enjoyment. I simply would like to warn those who haven't purchased this and who are on the edge to NOT buy it. At the very least, go to Barnes and Noble (like I did) and check it out first. If it's what you want and you are pleased, then I am happy for you. But I will be sticking with my guides by Nikki Stafford, which I can't say enough about. I really hope some day someone will come along and give us the thousand-page treatment this material deserves.
0786955570|3.0|It is important to understand that this game is intended for people with at least a passing understanding of tabletop gaming. The rulebook can seem both over complicated and lacking sufficient instruction depending on the stage of the game.  The only way to learn and enjoy the game is to play, (and most likely screw it up the first time), while correcting errors as you go and remembering it for the next time.  Once you actually undersand the game, however, it can be great fun. If you play tabletop, this is a great way to get your fix in an hour, And it can even be played solo. I can totally recommend this game to any adult with tabletop experience, who has similarly inclined friends, and a good-sized table.  To others, though, the rules may be a headache, and it doesn't have the traditional competitive vibe associated with board games.  You either succeed as a team or fail together, so competitive board-gamers will be denied their fun.  At $65 msrp, I don't think I could recommend it as a casual purchase for the un-initiated, but if you're interested in a quick d&d experience, you have the money, and you know how to roll a d20, the game can be totally worth the cost.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|After coming home this weekend from seeing the latest romantic comedy at the box office (which will remain unnamed), I must say this made up for the $6 I blew at the show yesterday.  I thoroughly enjoyed this lighthearted movie of four people struggling with love coming into their own realizations that finally lead them to those kind of individuals that bring out the best in them as human beings.<br /><br />I'm not much of a Cameron Diaz fan, but I thought she was great.  Kate Winslet was wonderful as well, totally unpretentious in character, which I found surprising.  Jude Law is to die for, as usual.  Jack Black was finally in a serious role.  Good flick, not filled with cursing and the usual nudity that Hollywood thinks makes a good movie, which in fact, it takes away from the emotion, struggles, and ultimate outcomes that are more important.  I found it enjoyable indeed, probably because I relate to the struggles of women who stick with men that are frankly a waste of time.
B000VD5I94|5.0|Robocop is back in 1080p, it is a dream come true for me, this was the first real ACTION movie I saw when I was little, sound 10/10, picture 9.5/10. Plus lots of extras, and all kinds of other Robocop onfo, if your a huge fan like me, but it NOW, but get the Blue Ray for more action and killing.
0316077054|5.0|First off, I'd like to say that I've been waiting forever and a day for this book to be released. I was among the many that loved Beautiful Creatures. It's funny because I remember going to the Barnes & Noble and looking for the longest book I could find in the YA section. I guess it's funny because that was a lot of people's complaint about the book - it was too long. And although I can admit to it dragging a bit, I have an affection for long books.    Anyhoo, back to the actual book I'm reviewing *clears throat* Beautiful Darkness. This book was just so amazing. I actually liked it just as much as the first book in the Caster Chronicles and to top it off, I think the writing was even better. The storyline was so crazy twisted and I never knew quite where it was going. It was a roller coaster of fun and saved me on a \\"vacation\\" gone awry.    I really really try to make my reviews as spoiler free as possible, so as far as plot details go, I'm going to say that what happens at the very end of the book is totally crazy and Saraphine is an evil witch with a capital \\"B\\".    Which I guess brings me to my character portion of the review.    As always we have our adoringly wonderful Ethan. It's always nice to have a change of pace and have a book narrated by a male character. Not that I object to a female narrator, being that I am....female....but it's nice to have things all changed up. I really do like the love story between Ethan and Lena, but in this book I felt like Ethan should have been mad at Lena more than he was. Maybe it's because I'm an angry person by nature (uuuuhhh *stammers* that sounded bad), but I think the Ethan let too much go. But, I guess it's a book and mushy must come first....*big grin*.    Next we have Lena, our lovely green eye/gold eye brunette beauty who can also cast all sorts of craziness your way. She was a bit twisted in her own right, which I adored. And although many of her decisions, in my opinion, sucked, I do feel for her, even throughher stupidity. After what happens at the end of BC, you can't help but think Lena is in for some bad stuff up ahead.    Moving on, we have Amma, Ethan's stand in mother and caretaker, who we find out so many new things about, plus, she has always been a character I love. Mostly for her superstitious ways and for the complete South that is in her. It's one of the things I love so much about this series, the deep South implanted within. Link, Ethan's best friend, is really an awesome friend and I would love one just like him. Ridley is totally nuts and maybe a bit homicidal, which I suppose is why I love her. Well, that and her fabulous wardrobe.    I do think my favorite character of all time though is Macon, Lena's uncle. I know he isn't in the book much, and mostly in flashbacks, but his character to me has always been fascinating.    Overall, the characters were wonderful and the plot was so surprising that I think the year wait was definitely worth it. And seriously, with prison balls, siren's who lick lollipops, a crazy pack of incubus', a secret love that spans decades, a Siamese cat that RoCkS and the Order of Things you couldn't ask for more.    Summary review: This book was awesome. Better writing than the first and shorter descriptions, but still leaving the vividness in the writing. The characters were lovable and the plot surprising.
0471267554|5.0|Purchased just before the holidays.....not the time to start a new diet; however, time to review content and start the new year right!!  What I've read to date is excellent and very easy to understand!
B00428ZRFY|4.0|I'm not buying that the people giving this album one star seriously bought the album. 1st of all if you are a big enough fan to even buy the album there should be at least 2-3 songs that you liked. The problem with this is that Rihanna already said the album title reflects her ATTITUDE and STYLE not the actual music. Had she really put a bunch of dance tracks on the song people would complain about that too. The people that genuinely bought it because they thought the title would reflect the actual songs, I understand where you are coming from.    S&M- Not the strongest song on the album and definitely goes back to the cliche style Rihanna is known for but it's still a decent song even though lyrics are extremely lacking. The dance fanatics will eat this one up.     What's My Name (Feat. Drake) - An instant favorite when it premiered as a new single. This song is one of Rihanna's best songs in my opinion. The \\"oh nana\\" is very hypnotizing and one of her best verses of all time is the bridge in this song.     Cheers (Drink To That) - The description from blogs made it seem like this song was an uptempo so when I first heard how slow it was I was shocked but not surprised. Most Rihanna songs are just not what you expect them to be.     Fading- Definitely one of the worst songs on the album. It does absolutely nothing for me at all. Out of all the hot songs to choose I can't believe she would pick one so boring. It sounds like your typical rnb song which I hate. Not catchy at all. Rihanna had previously stated that she didn't want to do generic pop songs but she was all for generic rnb songs? Where's the logic in that Rihanna? This song is terrible and I cannot believe you thought this was hot enough to put on the album.    Only Girl- Ok I'll admit when I fist heard this song I wasn't to fond of it. But after really giving it 2-3 listens its actually one of the best dance songs of the year. Very well produced and the lyrics are perfect.    California King Bed- Unlike Fading this song is one of the best songs on the album hands down. Lyrically one of the strongest songs and shows off her versatile voice sounding almost like a country singer with pop & rnb flavor. My favorite line \\"So how come when I reach out my fingers, It seems like more than distance between us.\\" If you don't want to buy the whole album definitely purchase this song.    Man Down - Only TRUE Rihanna fans will love this one and unfortunately not a lot will seeing as this song goes back to her roots and that was when nobody really paid much attention to her. I enjoy the speaking part at the end \\"Why did I pull de trigger, pull de trigger, pull de trigger BOOM. And end a n*gga, end a n*gga life so soon. The rum pa pa pum's are EPIC!    Raining Men- When I first heard that Rihanna was doing a song with Nicki I thought they would come up with something so different and crazy. Well turns out all they could come up with was a Beyonce reject song which is not good at all. (even when Beyonce does it) This is just like a song I could see Beyonce doing. Lyrically its horrible. The beat is very ghetto especially with the unnecessary \\"Hey's\\" being shouted during the hook and Nicki could have written a better verse. To me this song is the worst in Rihanna's whole discography.     Complicated - This is not my favorite song on the album at all but I love the fact Rihanna challenges her vocal chops in this song. This is a \\"Fading\\" type song but it is not as generic production wise. I would love Rihanna to consider better producers because if this is all they can come up with these days, she is in trouble.    Skin - One of the best songs on the album! Its a very sexy song and it's a very mature take at a sexy song. I always thought Rude Boy was a bit trashy and too much.    Love the Way You Lie part 2 - This song was just not needed! I don't understand why she felt the need to rehash one of the most successful songs of the year. This song is a true waste of space. However, I do love the lyrics and Eminem's verse. But they could have kept this song along with Fading and Raining men OFF of the album.    Overall I give this album 4 stars.     My reason: The bad songs are REALLY bad. The good songs are good but there could have been a variety of style. I can see with some people the mid tempo vibe really throws off people that think the title reflects the album. I'd hate to buy an album from an artist I wasn't a huge fan of just to warm up to most of the songs. If you're not a huge fan but wanted to give this album a try, I can see why you would feel cheated from the title. You still shouldn't be giving it a 1 star though. This is not the Black Eyed Peas so go look for their album to find 100% dance tracks. It still gets a nice vote from me.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This is a good condenser microphone. The sound pickup is excellent and the accessories that come with the unit are very helpful.
B003OAHE3O|5.0|I have been a Chemical Brothers fan for a long time. For me Surrender was their best album, it was just perfect electronic music, just perfect. \\"Come with Us\\" was not a bad album but i was a little disappointed with \\"Push the Button\\" and \\"We are the Night\\" but NOW.....they are absolutely BACK!!!  \\"Further\\" returns to the roots which made chemical brothers so big.......It those beat changes, those sharp noises, the melodic synths which elevate the song, they enhance the feeling of the electronica and I can just picture Tom and Ed banging those machines in a concert, jumping and making me feel like i am escaping the gravity of planet earth!!!    My favorite song by far from this album is Escape Velocity.....and the video is just amazing!! you must check this out definitely!!  My next favorite track is Another World....the beat to this song combined with the lyrics and the sharp bouncy noises are the Chemical Brothers' trademark.  The album opens and ends very well, the first and last song glue the album together to make it a unique musical experience you cannot miss!  If you like electronic music this might be the best Chemical Brothers album of the decade.
B004132HZS|5.0|I saw the new Sherlock Holmes advertised on my local PBS station via Masterpeice Theatre and was excited to check it out.  While I am not a huge Sherlock Holmes fan, Sir Arthur Conan Doyles' books were required reading in highschool and my mother introduced me to the old 1930's and 1940's television shows with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.  I thought they were pretty good.  I was also eager to see the newest Sherlock Holmes movie with Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law.  I thought the movie was decent (gave it 4 stars out of 5) and enjoyed the chemistry between Downey Jr. and Law.  That said... nothing prepared me for this present day version.  I absolutely loved it and waited on baited breath for every episode!  Cumberbatch and his sidekick Freeman are just too perfect for their fictional counterparts.  I'm hoping that Masterpeice Theatre receives such an overwhelmingly positive response that they create more episodes.<br /><br />Hands down, one of the best new televison shows that have come out in a very long time!
0316069485|3.0|Master crime novelist Michael Connelly's new novel is titled The Reversal, and reprises criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller and detective Harry Bosch, his half-brother. These quirky and competent characters could bear the full burden of the novel, but Connelly supports them with a well-constructed plot that kept me engaged from beginning to end, with enough surprises to add to the overall entertainment. Haller agrees to an unusual proposal from the D.A. that he sign up as a special prosecutor for the retrial of an old case. Haller reluctantly agrees, and enlists his ex-wife as co-counsel and Bosch as investigator. All the family and relationship issues provide added enjoyment for Connelly fans, and the teenagers provide enough background to draw out more balanced dimensions from the hardworking main characters. Readers who like crime fiction are likely to find reading pleasure from this novel.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B002VECM6S|5.0|Modern entertainment as a whole acts like dysfunctional are the only kind with \\"fun\\" in them. This movie shows the value of a functional family as well.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock earned her Oscar award in this movie, but in reality it's about Michael Oher (played by Quinton Aaron) -- every scene either contains him or he's part of the discussion.<br /><br />Even though this movie is about sports, it isn't a sports movie. The focus is on the development of Oher. Leigh Anne Touhy may have taken the lead but the rest of the family all took an active role in accepting him.<br /><br />There are several things I like about this movie. First, you've finally got a movie where the main characters are Republican Christians and they're still good people! Second, it recognizes the reality of racism but it also shows that there are many whites who are not racist (including Republican Christians).<br /><br />While this movie is about a family, is it a family movie? I have for years believed that a PG-13 movie disqualifies itself from being a family movie, but this is one that can make me reconsider. In reality, I consider this a PG movie with a few PG-13 scenes as opposed to a true PG-13 movie. As with any movie (even G-rated ones), I encourage parents to watch it with their kids.<br /><br />This movie is a great blend of humor and drama. It has moments of humor, such as Katherine Bates' character describing Tennessee's football field or when Leigh Anne takes Mike shopping.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie. I'd also suggest showing it as a double feature with either \\"Facing The Giants\\" or \\"The Second Chance\\" -- \\"The Blind Side\\" has elements that fit with either of those movies.
B004BSAPRK|4.0|If you are a huge Rihanna fan that loves whatever she does this album is for you! I am a huge Rihanna fan and I seriously love whatever music she releases. She can never do wrong in my eyes but I can admit faults with this album and why some people may not like it.    Rihanna is probably the most inconsistent artist when it comes to music style. She does practically everything reggae, pop, dance, rnb, and everything else in between. For some this is a great thing, especially people who love variety. The bad thing about this is that ultimately her fan base is dangerously split. We have pop and dance Rihanna fans who will enjoy songs like Only Girl, S&M, Cheers, California King Bed. We also have urban Rihanna fans that will love What's My Name, Fading, Skin, and Raining Men. Unfortunately its not very well balanced so that all of her fan bases can enjoy it. This can lead them to buy the songs separately or simply download the album for free. Not settling with a specific music style or evenly covering all sides of her most popular music styles with each album hinders her from having a strong solid fan base (which she definitely could have). With Rated R being so different she developed a darker fan base as well who won't find Loud impressive at all.    The highlights of the album are Only Girl, California King Bed, Skin, What's My Name, and Man Down. I'd recommend this for people looking for a variety of genres in one album and also fans of Rihanna that like more than one specific style when it comes to her music. If you like What's My Name buy this album because the album tends to lean more towards that kind of laid back vibe. If you liked her previous album from 2006 A Girl Like Me buy this album because it is a nicely revamped version of it. If you are looking for an album full of dance tracks this album is not for you.
0312944098|4.0|My first Archer. I know he went to jail, even though he's a peer of the realm. That's what democracy is all about. His detailed account of the prison life has the authentic touch. Some of the reviewers have mentioned the plot twists as predictable. Sure, once you read it, you think, of course! But before that, you are turning pages like an addict.   It is already blazoned across the book cover and inside, it is a modern reworking of The Count of Monte Cristo. Actually there is a good measure of the Three Musketeers: One for All; All for one, which actually is the main theme of the first part of the plot, leading to the Dantes revenge.   Characters are nice handled. But it is an action story and thank god, he spares us the usual fillers which go by the name of fleshing out the characters. Good old fashioned villains and virtuous protagonists. Danny, Moncreif and Big Al are another three musketeers. It's a pity . . . but no I will not spoil the pleasure of your reading through it. Old fasioned and greatly entertaining. Perfect to curl up with, either inside the bed during winter or on the beach during summer.

B000002LTU|5.0|I've been a Miles Davis listener for over 30 years and I just received a copy of \\"Doo-Bop\\".  Technically an old guy (55) and I'M giving this 5 stars, i.e., enjoyment of this music has NOTHING to do with age as previous reviewer \\"Duncan Page\\" asserts.  There is no way this is a 3 star release as shown here on Amazon.  I instantly \\"took\\" to \\"Doo-Bop\\", in fact, I like it so much that I'm going to play it yet again and then probably again.  The ONLY downside to \\"Doo-Bop\\" is that by CD standards, this is really an EP (39 minutes).<br /><br />I own a large collection of Miles Davis recordings starting with the Charlie Parker sides on Savoy/Dial all the way through to the acid-funk of Agharta/Pangea and on to his melodic/rhythmic focus of \\"Amandla\\".  I've also read four biographies and his autobiography (I'm a musician and want to learn as much as I can about the musicians I listen to, especially their thinking and their process).<br /><br />Miles is about change.  He has a personal sound that is instantly recognizable but that sound is always combined with something new that, more often than not, signals a change that takes many years for others to get their head around.  Appreciating this release is all about how well you understand Miles' pursuit of his art and the ability to listen to something that has a little joy in it.  It also helps if you like funky grooves that just won't quit.<br /><br />I resisted this CD for years and years (almost 2 decades) as I built my collection.  In fact I resisted all over the Warner Bros releases; however, every time I saw this I would just shake my head in disgust as I'd heard he conspired with \\"rap\\" artists to put this one together.  I was just like those who shook their heads in disgust at Miles when he went electric back in 1969.<br /><br />Recently I have been filling in the missing pieces of my collection - some of the more obscure Prestige sides (\\"Miles Davis & Horns\\") and the Warner Bros catalog.  I have almost every release that Miles was actively involved in (not the bootlegs) between 1948 and 1991 and I have to write that Doo-Bop is as fresh and exciting as anything else Miles did in his lifetime.  I LOVE this music and those who belittle it really do not \\"get\\" Miles Davis and his aesthetic.  This music is unlike anything else Miles did in his lifetime (I do realize Doo-Bop was completed after his death).  It isn't \\"fragile\\" or \\"dark\\" or \\"brooding\\" like much of Miles' work, there is a lot of \\"joy\\" in this music and perhaps this is why some feel it isn't up to scratch? Clearly Miles was having a lot of fun here.  There is not one bad track on this CD.  It's just great music and, from a self-avowed Miles expert, it's fun and has as much artistic integrity as anything else he released in his lifetime. No, that doesn't mean it is as complex or that there's a lot of virtuosity demonstrated.  This is all about feeling, it isn't meant to be Bitches Brew or Kind of Blue.  I do wish I hadn't resisted Doo-Bop for so many years and, if you really do understand this man's art, you need this in YOUR collection.d in (not the bootlegs) between 1948 and 1991 and I have to write that Doo-Bop is as fresh and exciting as anything else Miles did in his lifetime.

B003UTUQ3E|4.0|\\"Station to Station\\" remains one of Bowie's seminal albums. This three CD set includes a digital copy of the original RCA issue of the 1985 CD which is highly regarded among Bowie fans. The other two CDs are Bowie's Nassau concert from 1976 to support \\"Station to Station\\". Unlike the deluxe set which includes five discs (everything here plus DVD 5.1 mix disc), a vinyl copy of \\"Station to Station\\" and a 2 record set of the Nassau concert plus a replica of an original ticket with the limited edition # on it as well as photos and a booklet), this set doesn't have the vinyl nor does it have the DVD-A discs and it is missing the CD that has the previously unreleased version of \\"Station to Station\\" and single mixes.<br /><br /> The concert is outstanding although the mastering on it leaves something to be desire--it's brickwalled meaning there's virtually no dynamic range and it's compressed which can be fatiguing. It's too bad because this is a TERRIFIC performance. The packaging looks nice but it would be better to have some protective inserts for the CDs or I would prefer a jewel box to put it in. Be aware that \\"Life on Mars\\" and \\"Five Years\\" feature a drop in sound quality as they had to use a different source tape for both songs than the rest of the concert.<br /><br />Certainly \\"Station to Station\\" (the original album)deserves five stars and the reissue of the previous RCA edition sounds extremely good.The sound quality for the \\"Station to Station\\" album is identical to the original Japan for Japan edition (from what I can tell)of the album. If you liked the original CD pressing you'll like this edition of the album as well but be aware it sounds different than both the Ryko edition of the album AND the EMI remaster that was done by Peter Mew.<br /><br />Aside from the three CDs we also get a booklet and three photos of Bowie on heavy cardboard stock. The \\"Station to Station\\" CD is housed in a cardboard sleeve that resembles a miniature version of the vinyl packaging while the other two CDs from the Nassau show are also housed in a double cardboard sleeve. Everything is housed in a CD sized cardboard box.CDs from the Nassau show are also housed in a double cardboard sleeve. Everything is housed in a CD sized cardboard box.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|...you will love this movie. It's a little far fetched but every bit as entertaining as the series and the first movie.
B000P0J09M|1.0|This DVD version was made many, many years ago and is set in matted version, so the size of the screen is about half of your tv size.  Also, it's so old that you have to flip the DVD over to see the second half of the movie.  It is very grainy, awful.  They should really say this in the description.  Splurge and buy the 20th anniversary or Blu-ray version.
044654759X|5.0|I love Sparks' books (and movies) so I can't wait to get his books.  I just read Safe Haven and have not been able to stop thinking about this book. I loved all his characters, there was even some love for bad boy Kevin.  Like others, I got the 'Sleeping with Enemy' vibe, which was a tough movie to watch but still a favorite of mine.  I kept thinking through this book 'hope they make a movie from this one, too' which it turns out they are.  Sparks has a gift, that is for sure.      Thank you, Mr. Sparks, for captivating us with stories that become part of us forever.  Looking forward to your next work.    (If you want another author that is similiar to Sparks, try Charles Martin.  LOVE his books, too!  Start with the Dead Don't Dance.)

The icing on the cake: I have a niece who does DNA research with HELA cells, so it kind of personalizes the whole story.    Even though it's nonfiction, this story is a novel and a mystery that is both exciting and absorbing.  Don't miss it.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is one of the best, if not THE best mini-series I've ever watched. I watched all four episodes without a break. The cast was perfect. The whole thing was perfection.

I am a huge trek fan and was very excited when i hurd that it was om blu ray. lots of people are complaining about the remastered version. But on the blu ray set you get both the original and the remastered versions. not only this but they are both in full HD. so whats the point in complaining about the remastered when you dont have to watch it anyways.    This is a great set it has 20 discs total.   season 1: 7 discs  season 2: 7 discs  season 3: 6 discs  It has all 79 episodes in the original and remastered editions fully restored in HD.

0470876417|5.0|I bought \\"Business Model Generation\\" after thumbing through it at a local bookstore. The design is absolutely captivating and engaging.<br />But greater than that, the way business modeling is broken down so you can build your own back up...is a revelation.<br /><br />I've worked online since 1997 and gone through a number of business models over the last almost 14 years. I'm currently looking at a totally new business model, this time that is scalable beyond anything I've ever done.<br /><br />Business Model Generation provides a blueprint (and the book design very much has an architectural plan element) to building something greater than I could conceive on my own -- and that will work.<br /><br />If you do one thing with this book: GET A BIG WHITEBOARD and POST-IT NOTES.<br /><br />The concepts and graphics are excellent to use in a team setting (even with only 2 people). I saw an immediate application for the \\"The Empathy Map\\" (adapted from Xplane) that maps a what a customers \\"thinks, hears, feels, says\\" in a usable format.<br /><br />While the concepts are sketched out, it's really up the to reader to decide what areas they need more information on, for example \\"brainstorming rules.\\" Do you know what they are? This books covers an outline of useful rules, but without detail.<br /><br />If there's a downside, I agree that the type is small. I am surprised with so many co-authors that this issue wasn't addressed.

B0001Z53F6|1.0|I was never a big Who fan and recently saw an old (late '60's?) Stones concert tape on which they performed, poorly by comparison.  But I had fond memories of this album and was looking for hard-to-find surround sound dvd's to play in my car, which comes equipped with it.  I've only played it once, and there's the possibility of incompatibility with my system, but it was a big disappointment - poor quality sound which may have taken the heart out of the \\"opera\\", which now seems extremely dated.  One man's opinion: don't bother.
0634014331|4.0|This book is really well done, in that it explains in detail all the controls and idiosyncracies of the Hammond organs and then presents a series of musical exercises to illustrate.  The musical exercises though aren't for begginers... they are more for intermediate to advanced players I would say... so for experienced players looking to get into the \\"tone-wheel\\" sound it is perfect... absolute beginners though will need to work up to this.

B0046IGOIO|4.0|There seems to be two camps of people regarding this release. Some say it is a boring concert, and the sound quality is not very good. Others find it a great example of The Doors talent and improvisational skills.     I'm in the later camp. Sure there are some weak moments in this recording. But the individual parts are larger than the sum... if that makes sense.    There are a number of great performances in Vancouver:    - When the Music's Over  - Who Do You Love (w/ Albert King)  - Light My Fire    Regarding the sound quality. As mentioned in an earlier post this is not a soundboard recording.  It was recorded with 2 microphones on the stage.  An earlier post said the stereo separation is poor. I disagree, there is plenty of separation. Robby's guitar is very clean, clear and resolved on the right side (stereo channel), Ray's keyboards are distinct, but can sound a bit distorted when they get loud. Densmore's drums can be soft in the mix, though still clear.  Jim's vocals are not center stage, a bit biased to the left (stereo channel)    Is this the best album for a Door's neophyte? No.     However if you like any of The Doors live albums...  Absolutely Live, In Concert, or many of the BMA releases. You probably will appreciate this album.     A recommendation for those who would like to hear some of the best Doors live recordings.  1) In Concert. This is a \\"best of\\" creation by The Doors producer Paul Rothchild. It is an amalgamation of different concerts. Well recorded, with great performances, it is the gateway live album.  2) Live in Detroit. This was one of the cities that Bruce Botnick recorded using 8 track equipment. Sound quality is absolutely stunning. It sounds like it was recorded today. It is a long concert with great performances.    Hope this helps.
B002WY65VU|2.0|Well, first off, the trailer made this out to be a completely different movie than what we actually got. The trailer promised rather comical zombie-on-human gore action. I was hoping for something along the lines of &#34;Shaun of the Dead&#34; or &#34;Evil Dead&#34; in combo of gore & laughs. In the end, there was very little focus on Zombies. I can't think of another zombie film where the zombies take a back seat to teen romance & end up being little more than a plot device with cameo appearences instead of the being the main attraction.  I would have to say the most entertaining parts of the movie were the protagonist falling for the same dumb trick over & over again & the Bill Murray cameo that demands the younger generation watch Ghostbusters, but as many professional reviewers will tell you, it's unwise to show a superior film in the background of your own movie. Except for a few scattered instances, the movie is pretty forgettable & the plot is as thin & transparent as wrapping tissue.  Spoiler alert; none of the annoying main characters die like you expect them to, & they are ALL annoying This movie came out at a time where slasher movies had degraded to little more than a visible unstoppable entity slaughtering unlikable characters you can't wait to see get bumped off. Did anyone die in this movie? Does this even qualify as horror? I would rather sit through Uwe Boll's &#34;House of the Dead:Phunny Version&#34; than watch this again.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|For many of us the name Leonard Cohen is as familiar as a best old friend, or a member of our family. This is, of course, a wonderful thing!<br /><br />But, fortunately, time and history go on, and every year brings this super-talented poet, songwriter, and artist more and more dedicated fans. Again, a wonderful thing!<br /><br />The past year-and-a-half has seen the release of \\"The Isle of Wight Concert\\", \\"Live in London\\", and, now, \\"Songs From the Road\\". All three sets are fantastic must-have \\"moments\\" from this great man's performance history. Simply put, there is perhaps no other artist with a more lengthy, consistently first-rate in output (both as a writer and also as a singer)during a career except perhaps for Bob Dylan. When one stops and thinks about it, this is astonishing, considering how many \\"greats\\" turn out to be meteoric in nature once \\"time\\" is factored in. Also consistency of quality material and delivery, with sheer ability to withstand these many years of living in the surely draining and wearisome, hectic world of touring, worldwide, and keeping up with creating, recording, etc. Most simply cannot, and do not, last. Those who do of course, become \\"Saints\\" if you will, and certainly Leonard Cohen is at the pinnacle of this rare group.<br /><br />With age the \\"Grand Old Man\\" becomes even better, more endearing to our ears. How many artists can sing the same songs to us, over and over, all these years and they just get \\"better and better\\" and \\"more meaningful\\" both \\"to us\\", and in Cohen's delivery of them \\"for us\\"? Not many.<br /><br />With the release of the \\"Isle of Wight Concert\\", Cohen's longtime fans were given a great gift from the past...a 30 year old document of this great artist performing live all those many years ago, and we welcomed it eagerly!<br /><br />Then, at the beginning of the year, \\"Live in London\\" was presented on television, and released for our pleasure. Surely the \\"highlight\\", for a great many, of entertainment recordings (aural and also visual) for the year...and the release deserves the great acclaim it has received.<br /><br />And, now, \\"Songs From the Road\\" adds further to this sequence, by presenting many additional performances from his \\"stopping places\\" around the world on his tour that \\"Live in London\\" was a part of.<br /><br />There are a few songs repeated here from the \\"London\\" set, but they are so wonderful you will not mind (if you already have the \\"London\\" set--as well you should). Some have griped here about this, but it is nit-picking on their part. Others have complained that \\"it doesn't hold together\\"...well, one must consider and remember that these recordings are taken from concerts from all over the globe. Neither Cohen nor Sony have hidden or denied this. Simply put, they individually are outstanding performances, certainly worthy of documentation and preservation for our pleasure (so get over it, complainers)!<br /><br />The delivery of \\"Bird on a Wire\\" from Glasgow, will surely amaze you with the level of heartfelt intensity that Cohen retains for this great song...I'm betting it becomes your favorite recording of it...after all these years and years, still fresh and new, yet lived with; habited with. \\"Lover Lover Lover\\" will also find its way into your heart. \\"Heart With No Companion\\", \\"Waiting For the Miracle\\", \\"Avalanche\\", \\"Suzanne\\", \\"The Partisan\\", \\"Hallelujah\\", and \\"Closing Time\\" are all just as wonderful as they ever were, certainly, and perhaps even \\"better\\" than you remembered, especially with Cohen's current delivery.<br /><br />\\"Returning\\" from the previous release, are: \\"Chelsea Hotel\\", \\"That Don't Make it Junk\\", and \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\", surely not too much of a repeat for any Cohen fan!<br /><br />So, in retrospect, what we have here is sort of like a \\"postscript\\", if you will, to Cohen's fabulously successful World Tour, and, indeed, another testament to this Grand Old Man's great talent, and his relevance to us in this world, touching us as hedoes where we desperately do need to be touched.<br /><br />A fitting companion to the two previous CD/DVD releases, surely!<br /><br />In addition, presented on the cover of this release is perhaps one of the finest and certainly most intriguing photos of this great artist.

B002ZG9968|1.0|I mostly really like Jennifer Lopez movies.  She's just cute as the dickens, and her hair is so pretty.  I saw The Backup Plan a couple of weekends ago and it just wasn't up to her fun, playful standards.  The writing was terrible. It made her and her co-star seem like robots out of the fourth grade (but with adult bodies, including reproductive capabilities and really, really fast-growing, relentless stubble).  Their courtship was not credible, waaaay less so than any other JLo movie.  I'm willing to sit through goofy entertainment, but this one was really a waste of my time.  I should have used my time to floss my teeth instead.

B000063DHL|3.0|There are many great reviews for this record (Disc), but I never saw this as a good Maiden release, even all these years later. The Introduction of Synths aside, most of this is forgettable and standard Maiden. Hardly their shining moment. A bit uninspired lyrically and scattered musically. There is more melody on this, just not much real fire. A major bit of a letdown after such greats as 'Number', 'Piece of Mind' and 'Powerslave'.<br /><br />Good tracks are - 'Wasted Years', 'Sea of Madness', 'Heaven Can Wait' and 'Stranger in a Strange Land'.<br /><br />'Alexander the Great' is a really good piece that has many time changes, cool offbeats and excellent, melodic Guitar parts in its 8 minutes. Better than I remembered it from years ago. That is a major plus and why I am glad I went back to this disc. Actually brought my 2.5 rating to a 3. Good, Progressive Maiden.<br /><br />But, other than these notes, there are no GREAT tracks at all. Its highly polished and the keyboards/synths just sound dumb and forced in the choruses. Trying to add more melody for a more radio-friendly Maiden at that time. I was never a big fan of this and still am not to this day, but wont say it totally blows. It was a major letdown after their other releases, we will leave it at that.<br /><br />I see many disagree in terms of opinion, so maybe its just me. But clearly this is/was for fans of the 'slicker', commercial Maiden sound. But It would be the first of many seemingly directionless efforts by the band before Dickinson left for a while. It was the end of the 'perfection'-era Maiden for sure.
B0042JTDXK|2.0|This CD just isn't up to my expectations.   Rather disappointed in this purchase.  Gave it away to a die hard fan.   I don't care for some of the musical cuts and selections.  Josh has such a lovely voice, but this CD doesn't show it off as incomparison to his former releases.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|This product provides very compact packaging for the complete Next Generation series.  If you're short on space, this is a good idea.  However, there is unfortunately no guide list for what episodes can be found on each disc.  This was an anniversary gift for my parents, who have always been big Star Trek fans.  This was to replace the dozens of taped episodes they have been holding onto.  They have really been enjoying the episodes.  Great gift idea!
B003X2O6KW|4.0|This cd is way overrated by the elite media types who have jumped onto kanye's jock because they know that 'intellectuals' listen to his music and therefore will read the reviews. They're just trying to get attention by writing these reviews that took them weeks to write and 2 minutes for me to read and click \\"next\\".  While this is a really good cd, it's nowhere near a classic or even top 5 this year. These people are acting as if they've been hit with some double rainbow and if Kanye reads their review that he'll invite them to his house to be one of the 500 guests on his next track. hey if rick ross can come across as some legit mobster and hardcore rapper, then i'm sure any of these guys can do it?    I'm a big Kanye fan, love all of his cd's (including this one). I really like when artists grow and instead of trying to do the same things over and over, they realize that they have to keep moving on. This is what most of the great ones do and Kanye's doing it with every release.     But for real this CD is probably his weakest of them all. I rank them:    1. Late Registration  2. Graduation  3. College Dropout  4. 808s  5. MBDTF    I give it to 'ye for the production aspect. He goes nuts with the collabs and considering how many people who worked on this joint, it really sounds like one cohesive piece of work. So that's a real good thing.    Not so sure about some of the \\"artists\\" he collabs with though on the vocals like Fergie (wtf) or Rick Ross who is more industry-made than Bieber or Britney. Seriously this dude is whack.  One of my peeves with Kanye is that he often chooses really whack rappers to collab with (ross, The Game, Lil Wayne, cam'ron, etc).  I remember back in the day when you had a collab on your cd, it was one or two tracks and it was either with your boys that you grew up with or someone really DOPE.    Nowadays I realize it's a little different, the mid 90's sorta changed that and now every rap cd has to have a few collabs.  And i'm not exactlyknocking the collabs because while there are like 40 artists on \\"all of the lights\\", i think for the most part the song works well. But why put a verse at the end of the song like Rick Ross on \\"Devil\\" when the verse really adds nothing.  Kanye had that song out a while ago on the Good Friday release without Ross on there. It's like he just got a call from Rick Ross's agent and was like hey man i'll give you a mil if you put ross on the track and Kanye said yeah whatever. The verse doesn't go well with the song.      I love Kanye's concept songs like hey mama, roses, etc. He's good like that. But can you imagine Rick Ross just throwing a verse at the end of hey mama?  \\"Devil\\" was a dope track on its own, what was the point of that?     And I don't know why everyone needs to point out that there's 3 minutes of junk at the end of 'runaway' and claim that it's brilliant?  I like the song itself, think it's catchy and funny but the \\"extended\\" beginning of just one piano key over and over is really lame and the end of it is boring.  I don't see the point of breaking up tracks 12 and 13. All it does is cause my mp3 player to skip a slight pause at that point when i'm playing it through. It's one song so it should be one track.     For what i liked on this cd, first of all it seems that Kanye is sorta trying to get back into \\"RAPPING\\" which is why most of us were fans of his from the get go.  He has a unique flow and is clever most of the time.  Unlike a lot of Rap cd's, most Kanye fans don't buy for the collabos, we buy it to hear 'ye spit something clever over that kanye beat.  Monster is a great RAP song, So appalled is a great RAP song. So yeah it's nice to hear some Rap.     I love the production, everything's tight, well put together and catchy. I like the different microphone effects he uses, from auto tune to distortion, echo, whatever. It's all good. I do like most of the cameos. I like hearing random mc's throw some bars in the middle of a song on a song where it's appropriate like appalled, monster, even gorgeous.     One piece of advice to give to Kanye is that when having collaborations on your cd, it's best to make it sound like everyone's in the room doing their verses one after another, and that they're in the room all at once. On some of the tracks you can tell that some of the guests either e-mailed their verses in or just came into the studio for like 5 minutes, punched it in, and left.  But like i said before, most of the collabs work. Just some get to me and ruin songs depending on my mood.    Anyway, I put this as his worst work not cause i hate it, but simply because his previous cd's are better. Also, I don't know if this is a good reason or not to rank it the lowest, but there were some DOOOPPPE tracks on this good friday releases that should have made it to this cd. I hate hearing someone's dope mixtape and then hear their cd which isn't as good as the free stuff (yeah i'm talking to you g-unit).    So yeah guys, this is a real good cd but this isn't a classic by any means. A classic is one where a year, 2 years, 10 years from now, you still are gonna bump this.  Artists typically only have one or two classics because years from now when you want to listen to a kanye cd, this one isn't gonna be the one you reach for. You're gonna pick up Late Registration or College Dropout probably.  Or if you're in that singing mood you'll pick up 808s.  This will be stored way in the back of your home cd rack or lost under the car seat somewhere. Enjoy it now before the next Kanye cd comes out and makes you forget about this one.

0061900664|5.0|Tener una hermanita o hermanito es MUY difícil para los chiquitillos, este libro le encantó a mi hijo, tuvimos que leerlo más de 100 veces en una semana, le dio una idea a que esperar cuando llegara su hermana, cómo son los bebés y que iba a ocurrir, fue un acercamiento importante para él.     EL libro efectivamente hace referencia al uso de un biberón, pero es algo que se le puede explicar al niño fácilmente, en nuestro caso el entendió que su hermanita no toma biberón y a veces entonces dice que la va a sostener mientras ella toma de la teta.    Junto con otras estrategias y SUPER recurso de preparación!!!
B003SWNRU2|5.0|This is by far for me the album of the year!Great production from Andy Sneap & co. brings out the metal sound.There isn't one weak song on this CD!Mark Tornillo has some pipes in his vocals which fits perfectly,The boys still got it,hopefully the next release will top off this one!This is the best of the best in metal today! Buy it,you won't be disappointed & if you are then you don't know what metal is!
1439133948|5.0|Once again, Lois McMaster Bujold has written a fast-paced, funny thriller featuring Miles Vorkosigan. As she has demonstrated throughout the series, Miles proves to be not only witty and quick, overcoming his physical difficulties with his gifted perspective on problems, but he also grows as he moves through life. We are no longer watching the madcap adventures of a lunatic youth, but now viewing the no-less-exciting times of Miles, the parent.    This book would be all that you would expect from a Vorkosigan story, except for the fact that, as usual, what you expect to happen doesn't. It makes for another excellent read.
B003KUSUG8|2.0|I don't understand why everyone likes this cd so much. There are only a few tracks that I can seriously get into. If you would have told Eminem 10 years ago that he'd be working with PINK on a track he'd tell you to go ____ yourself.  10 years ago he'd make a song ABOUT Pink, not work with her. He's completely sold out and unfortunately it feels like he lost his motivation and inspiration when he lost his best friend Proof.  The guy has had a bad case of writers block over the past 5 years and his best songs are actually unreleased ones like 'the warning' about mariah and other freestyles that i've heard of his.      I still bump marshal mather's LP and Slim Shady LP every once in a while and then i turn this on and it's like \\"are you serious?\\"     He needs to   1) stop singing, especially in that high pitch voice on 'not afraid', you sound stupid.  2) stop yelling, you are yelling on all the tracks and it hurts my head.  even yelling on a track like 'so bad' which could have been awesome if it wasn't for the constant screaming.  3) get back to making funny tracks and telling hilarious stories. nobody cares about your personal life.     One thing i noticed in a lot of these reviews is that i hear \\"eminem is BACK\\"... really? where is he back from?  To me this CD sounds like nothing he's ever done. Are they saying that this is a lot like his first few cd's? Cause it's totally different. this is a lot more pop and much more personal than his first few cd's.  I don't understand. So many people are like \\"this is the eminem i used to love\\".  I don't know what you're talking about.    This cd is so overrated when it comes to those kinds of reviews. He's back? He just released a CD last year and honestly Relapse was a lot better than recovery.  At least it was full of Dre beats.     I'm really looking forward to more collabos of Eminem with Slaughterhouse and whatever he's gonna give Dre for the Detox cd.  This isn't a personal attack on Em. He's one of the greatest rappersever and the reason I give this two stars is because I recognize how he's switched his style up and is still one of the best at it.  But I can't give any more stars because the content about his personal life is whack, the screaming hurts my head, and the singing and pop feel is just so weird for an eminem cd.     Also, yeah i realize eminem is making bank off of \\"not afraid\\" but for x's sake, how did this guy go from his first few cd's to all of a sudden making a song that he closes concerts out with with a hook like \\"i'm not afraid to take a stand everybody take my hand\\"  I mean for real this is not anything you'd listen to and say \\"OMG EMINEM IS BACK, THIS IS THE EM THAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR???\\" lol really?
B002ZG99G8|2.0|They shoulda had more of the bad guy.    Really tryign to be way too cool and the main guy who is ancient goon gets with who?    wtf!!!    as realistic as transformers!
B003UERZ88|4.0|Great CD from Rob & the boys,has a hint of Priest in some of the songs but they do set their sound apart.Metal Mike & Roy Z do put on some great shredding and it really accents the songs.I would recommend this to any metal fan,they won't be disappointed! 4 1/2 stars!
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Great TRE O for a brother sister band. Some of the other songs on the album I am shure will be hits.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Excellent series done in the 70s I believe and the series includes interviews with everyone from soldiers to generals from all countries.  Very well done, great footage and very easy to watch--not boring or dry.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|People are so quick to judge. This album is lyrically empowering for girls, and they're the same ones 's music. Of course it's nothing like Lil Kim's music.. Nicki Minai isn't Lil Kim, she's Nicki Minaj. Kim is not messin with Nicki lyrically.  She's bringing back pride into female rap that has nothing to do with sex. That in itself is groundbreaking.  This album will go down in history by default, because it's ending the drought of female voices in rap.  Be a part of history & get this.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I love this book.  Bourdain is very captivating and creates a page turner with this book.  However, I can't believe how many typos there are in the kindle edition.  This is an embarrassing flaw for this privately educated chef.
044024367X|2.0|This is the first of the Jack Reacher series that I was really disappointed by. I finished it, but I'm still not sure what all was going on. I hope this is not a new trend for this series.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|So i heard this movie was good and indeed it was, it is very original. Its an alien movie that doesnt conform to the typical alien hollywood sci fi movies, you will know what i mean when you watch it. The storyline/plot i couldnt predict and when i thought this or that was gonna happen i was pleasantly surprised. Overall it is a great movie.. Beautiful ending scene kept me wanting to see more. An original thrillride loved every minute of it
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is a great purchase for photographers, it can hold a lot of stuff, the velcros can adjust to the way you need it, and the inner bags are well sized, furthermore the price is really nice, compared to others backpacks that offer almost the same. About durability, I couldn't tell, I have used this just for a month, but it is comfortable, i think it has a good size, and seems well constructed. Maybe the front bag could use a little bit more of space, but it's not a big problem.
B002QEXN2K|3.0|This CD is not nearly as catchy as some of JM's earlier stuff.  There are a couple good songs, but the rest is overrated.  I still like John Mayer, but definitely not this album.
B003WTE886|4.0|I do love this album. However, as good as the music is, she's got a lot more sad songs full of regret than happy ones. I don't listen to this album straight through much anymore, like I do her first two. I skip a lot of songs. Each of them are excellent standing alone. Put all together, they make me sad. I'd prefer a better balance.    All that said, I think Taylor Swift is a superb wordsmith. In every song, she does an excellent job of telling a story. I love the album, I just take it a few songs at a time.
B0043URV8M|5.0|I like this Cd i'm a huge Harry Potter fan so i get the soundtracks for the music and artwork.This cd has a bunch of lil photos of the movie in the booklet and you can put it in the computer and download 5.1 Surround Sound version of the cd which is cool i wish i had surround sound now lol
B002N5N5LG|5.0|This show is awesome. I have not laughed out loud at a new TV show in quite some time, and I did with \\"Community\\". I started watching it because I love \\"The Soup\\", and Chevy Chase is always funny. But it's the strong ensemble as a whole that keep me hooked each episode. The special features are great; they really add to the depth of the characters. Buy it-you will love it!
1416950176|5.0|i love this book cause it looks alot like my family with this fighting and the two people who made this book...THEY ROCK!!!!!!i read this book 30 times now so yeah.that's my rewveiw.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite Eminem albums but I ended up having to buy it twice since I've never purchased an explict album from Amazon before and didn't realize that they don't clearly mark their edited versions. In my opinion they should mark both albums, one \\"Explicit\\" and one \\"Censored\\" so it's clear to the buyer which album they are purchasing. It is only because I loved this album that I was willing to buy it twice and because the censored version was on sale when I originally bought it that I took it in stride.<br /><br />I'm posting this review to warn any other idiots out there like me that might not realize this and perhaps may read the reviews first. LOL Buyer beware you're buying a CENSORED VERSION! :-)<br /><br />Happy trails!
1569242739|5.0|The pictures are great. The ingredients are easy and inexpensive. The instructions are easy to follow. This book is great for vegans and non vegans. Can't wait until I go to my next vegan potluck.
B00003CX95|5.0|One of my favorite movies! Fantastic battle scenes and cinematography even 15 years later, but more importantly just a really great story. I've watched it over 10 times and it is always entertaining. Love it!
B004498KPU|1.0|I'm not sure if I was sent a defective set or if this was just another money grab. But, it's raping Michael Jackson's legacy and exploit his fans. I expected a much better quality picture and sound coming from Sony. This is not remastered, in any way shape or form. It doesn't matter if you're viewing on wide-screen or a regular 4:3 ratio format, this is crap. Sony should be ashamed of themselves. This here, is the equivalent of those bootleg video's some guy sales out of the trunk of their car. The only thing missing is the audience sounds and the bouncing heads of people moving around in the theater.<br /><br />I'm just really disappointed. In addition to the slightly jittery frame rate, the picture quality is poor and the video size is ridiculous. To add insult to injury, I can't play the set on my surround sound because there are no  sound options. This is a product of, pure corporate laziness. Sony where is your pride?<br /><br />If this is what we loyal fans can expect from Sony's suits (a total disregard to quality assurance), then I will hold off buying anything else in advance from them.  I'm watching this, feeling totally PUNK'D...Anyone defending this is setting a precedent that says to SONY, \\"just slap Michael Jackson's name on anything and I'll blindly buy it.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|Agora was a Cinema Masterpiece, no less.  It showed the evils of religion in whatever form it takes.  The film focuses on the Christians but it shows the Hubris and self importance of all religions, \\"Pagan\\", Jew, and Christian.  They all felt that they were the chosen ones, that the others were misguided children who did not really understand the true word of God or the Gods and in this sanctimonious self righteosness they brought about a long slow slide into a Dark Age that lasted for a Millenium and destroyed almost all of the light and knowledge that man had created.  The ironic thing was that some of the \\"Pagan\\" writings were saved by the Christian Church not because they valued the widom and knowledge but because they used them to show how much more enlightened they were and how ignorant and un-enlightend the \\"Pagans\\" were.  Well at least they saved those great works for a more enlightend time.    The most dire and horrifying effect this film has is to show the shadows of our world today.  Once again our world is sliding into the darkness of religous extremism and ignorance.....this time Islam.  Once again anything that does not fit into what they feel is the \\"True Way\\" must be destroyed and once again our leadership and our societs are a bunch of spineless cowards giving in to the ignorance and darkness and masking it as \\"compassion\\", \\"tolerance\\", and that it is \\"inevevitable\\".    I hope that the world will wake up and all religions will be abolished so that God and Man can really live in peace.
0312600844|3.0|Buried within this 562 page book is a far more powerful 350 page book. I blame the editors for the extraneous material, the often lackadaisical prose, the dangling participle (didn't note the page).     To me \\"The Corrections\\" (and to a lesser extent \\"How to be Alone\\") showed what an excellent writer Franzen is , but \\"Freedom,\\" in aiming for \\"masterpiece,\\" meanders and drifts and dawdles. Was the 160+ page Patty autobiography really necessary? The rather implausible teenage Joey as mid-east truck parts supplier? Lalitha's gratuitous death?     The Patty-Walter-Richard triangle, an effective \\"engine\\" of the novel, I thought worked, but in apparently trying to encompass all of recent society, Franzen wandered too far from the the source of energy. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't not find the dialogue implausible. I think, for the most part, he writes terrific dialogue. Freedom is certainly not a bad book; I'll continue reading what he writes. One star seems harsh, except the leading one star review is very helpful and well thought out.
B003ZEQMIC|1.0|Buyers Beware!! I purchased this DVD and discovered much to my disappointment that I did not receive the movie, I got some bootleg movie about the making of this movie. It was supposed to have been a 2 disc set but I only received the one disc. Hopefully, they will do the right thing and refund my money!
B0042RUMEQ|2.0|I hate to discredit anyone's success, particularly a female rapper's ascension into the rap game. However, Minaj's talent is built upon a gimmick rhyme-flow and Barbi Doll costume. Although Lil Kim built a career around sex appeal, Minaj doesn't project a foundational style that will last very long. Her animated rhyme pattern is average at best. In short, this CD is just not that good. There are only a couple of good songs - Right Thru Me, Moment 4 Life, Your Love. But I will say this, the release of the album coincides with the height of her popularity which should produce decent sales.
0240816250|5.0|Photography is how I earn my living.  Digital while having advantages in turn around time has almost cost me the hoby aspect of photography.  To try to find the enjoyment factor again I turned back to film and have to say I am having a great time with it, due to in part the craftsmanship and difficulty of the medium.  I had printed wet prints before for about 8 years, twenty years ago but in a rudimentary way.  Way beyond Monochrome has opened the world of black and white crafsmanhip and has given me the enjoyment of photography back again!  This book is far beyond expectations!!!  The detail in each section and the breath and scope of the topics covered are exactly what I needed to transcend from \\"ordinary\\" black and whites and a level of frustration to what I have been wanting to be able to achieve as a fine arts printer.  I am still far back of where I want to be  but this book is my guide and inspiration to where I want to go. I already, have gotten prints that encourage me, whereas before I was getting mediocre prints due to lack of guidance, which made the darkroom experience somewhat frustrating.  Thank you for publishing this guide.  I really appreciate the effort that must have gone into it.  I also appreciate the fact that one can use it as a step by step towards better prints immediately but also that the big picture is also there with the theories behind the concepts.    This book has made an instant impact on the quality of my prints while also giving me the understanding of some of the concepts which will later heilp me achieve an even higher calibre of work.  I've read all the Adam Ansel books.  They are good, but nothing has opened my eyes and mind to techniques like this book  It is written sooo well!    Thanks you. This has been the best investment I've ever made in my photographic journey. It has made photography fun again because I have made prints that I otherwise would have had to be lucky to make without the book and it has given me the knowledge and confidence that with more practice putting in use some of the many, many tips and techniquies - that I will become skilled enough to keep myself moving forward.  The best investment in my passion - ever!
B00129H7VS|5.0|This movie was very close to the book. It was very well made. There was only one part near the end of this movie that could have been taken out. Other than that, it was amazing. Of course, the book is a lot better.
B003AO1SVS|4.0|Long-time Black Keys' fan here. I've been mesmorized by the band's growth by leaps and bounds over the years. What a long, strange journey it has been for the Ohio duo.<br /><br />\\"Brothers\\" (15 tracks; 56 min.) brings the band it its most accessible sound yet, sounding far more than just the garage duo of just electric guitar and drums from the early days (more on that later). The album reminded me of many earlier musical influences, including glamorous T-Rex of all bands o one track, but also of many blues bands. The album sounds great, even if it is overly long, cut the weakest 3 or 4 weakest tracks and we're talking a 4.5 or 5 stars album. But that's just me perhaps, I like albums tight and reasonably short (in the 40-45 min. range). But that's not to take away from the many sublime moments on here. A great album for sure.<br /><br />The real revelation for me came when I saw the Black Keys in concert again in September (opening for Kings of Leon here in Cincinnati), my first time seeing then again in a couple of years. Most telling was that the band, after opening just the 2 of them, played the majority of their set as a full band, with 2 additional musicians (mostly electric guitar and bass, a few times also on keyboards), and the band finally sounded fully fleshed out, and glorious. I hope that is the future of the Black Keys, they never sounded better. Meanwhile, \\"Bothers\\" is a great allbum.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|So first and foremost a lot of older movies (read 80's and 90's) have had horrendous digital transfersto hi-def or HD. I was disappointed with the Terminator transfers to blu-ray (T1 and T2). But I digress. While the price for this boxed set may seem outrageous, fans of the first 2 films will be amazed with how clear the pictures are. Considering these movies are from 1979 (Alien) and 1986 (Aliens) the transfer is almost as if they were done more recently. That said the 2 movies are great and the picture quality of the latter 2 movies are also stellar. While I am not a fan of the latter 2 you are forced to buy them as a set if you want the HD experience.    Pros  *Awesome Picture  *Awesome Sound  *Alien  *Aliens    Cons  *Price  *Forced to buy the bundle  *Not all bonus features are in HD    If it weren't for the list price $140 this would be a 5 star review. As such, I was able to pick this up for $70 - while even though I felt that price was still high it was definitely worth it. The standard and extended versions of the films were included as well as bonus content and the making of featurette. This is a must-have for Alien franchise fans. I only wish these were sold separately, as I would have probably only picked up the first 2 in the franchise. 3.5+ stars for awesome picture quality and sound. Took some off for the bundling and price.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I bought this after reading some negative reviews, but saw some positive footage on YouTube. This mic is useless. Even if you take the windscreen off and put the mic right next to your mouth, the audio is incredibly soft. If you manually raise the volume in post-editing, you then get static and hiss. Unusable. Stay away.
0439023521|5.0|For all the people complaining about it being too disturbing...congratulations on reading a book that's not sugarcoated sunshine.  If a book makes you think, it's done it's job well.  As for being too graphic for YA, I have to disagree there as well...none of the deaths cash on in \\"gore factor\\" but at the same time capture the sheer brutality of the Games the characters find themselves in.  I felt like this book worked perfectly to set up the setting for the post-apocalyptic world and for the sequels to follow.  I'm eager to find out what happens on a larger politic scale, and follow the characters I'm now invested in as the plots thickens, as it were.  Highly recommend, to YA and adult audiences.
0385533829|5.0|I love Dan Brown's work, especially when you have the pictures of symbols, buildings, and documents included to support the story.  The illustrated version always helps to clarify what is being explained in the story, like when Robert Langdon is explaining his knowledge of symbology.  I highly recommend this book!
B00275EHJG|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults...we have been Toy Story fans since my daughter was small  She is now 16 and we watched this movie together, and all we did was laugh.  A must see for everyone
B0044WUQ3G|3.0|This is another installment in the latest brand of horror movies that started with Open Water. I didn't have really high hopes when I rented it. I basically thought \\"Oh, it's Open Water, but really, really frickin' cold\\". But I'll admit, I kind of liked Open Water, so I decided to give this a shot.     I was pretty impressed overall. The production values were impressive. I had expected low-budget type effects, sets, etc. and it was much better. The acting performances were convincing and I can't say anything negative about them at all.     The story line overall actually does hold up to reasonable scientific scrutiny, save for a couple of minor elements that with a little tweaking would be almost flawless. It's a fairly realistic hypothetical plot and clearly someone thought out possible criticisms before they finished writing it.     Overall, I'd say it's a pretty good film. I'll probably buy this one. It was worth the rental and kept my attention. That said, this is probably not the movie for everyone. It's a little gory and will make you cringe a few times. Not everyone enjoys the suspenseful style of being stranded and waiting to die of the elements either. For some, it might be lacking in more substance to the plot, which admittedly can be a little sluggish here and there, but not for long. And there will always be the nay-sayers that are determined to believe it's impossible or they would have a perfect, fool-proof way out. Ironically, not unlike one of the characters in the movie.
B00008RH1H|5.0|Lots of mixed reviews here, most positive.  If you haven't read MacBeth, then you may not 'get' a lot of the references.  The other is to know a little about Japanese lore and mythology.  Even if you don't, this is still enjoyable.<br /><br />***Look up > Yurei &lt; on wikipedia or something.  This helps to identify and understand the spirit that Mifune comes across in the forest.<br /><br />Now, this is not a film for everyone and I would not recommend this be the first Kurosawa film one should watch (because it is rather quirky even for Kurosawa).  Mifune gives a riveting and over the top performance.<br /><br />Criterion did well in the localizing and digitizing, keeping the film true to original format but cleaning up some of the visual and audio.  The translation and subtitles are up to the usual rigorous Criterion standards.<br /><br />Also note:  this is considered one of the best Shakespeare film adaptations by most critics.  It bears a resemblance to MacBeth, but it still contains a lot of originality.  Not to mention that every year at the Ashland Shakespeare Festival (here in Oregon) they actually have a stage production of Throne of Blood.  So yes, they have a play based on a movie based on the play.  Pretty high praise from internationally renowned professional Shakespeare theater companies and actors in my opinion!
0061438294|5.0|I'm a Rookie cop and I thought I'd start studying more about reading body language to help me in my job.  I was recommended this book, and when I read the information about it being written by an ex FBI Agent, I thought perfect.  This book is great, it has lots of great information on basic and advanced body language \\"tells\\" that I would have never picked up had I not read this book.  It will prove to help me in my career, as well as my personal life.  The body language tells in this book can help in different ways such as telling if someone is lying, if someone is excited, anxious or uncomfortable.  After reading this book and taking notes on it, I feel powerful, like I can read people's minds.  Highly recommend.
B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|At one point I heard that the band perry was just not  going to \\"make it\\" since they just could not seem to pull  together an album. This was a bit after their song \\"Hip to my Heart\\"  made it into the top 40. But I am happy to see that they have proved  their critics wrong. The album is quite good... its not full of \\"number 1\\"  hits but I think there is the potential for at least 2-3 more to chart into  the top 40.     \\"You Lie\\" and \\"Walk me down the middle\\" seem obvious choices to make  the country charts, a couple of my favorites at least ;-)    \\"Double heart\\" and \\"Postcards from paris\\" may well also chart... Independence  is also another song that will probably show up in the top 40. Well  worth the purchase ... a good album and I do like supporting a new band.

B002T45VX6|4.0|Fans of early Shakira albums have heavily criticized her latest offering as a weak attempt to capitalize on the current dancehall trend. For them, the uptempo nature of the tracks presented here appear as if Shakira has stopped being true to herself for the sake of commerciality. However, a closer look at the lyrics reveals the signature style fans have come to know and love. It seems as though Shakira took her signature writing style and backed it with more electronic beats instead of her typical rock. While few tracks here are as instantly powerful as some of her earlier material, her third offering is just as enjoyable as her earlier English works.    Lead single \\"She Wolf\\" starts the album off firmly in electropop territory, setting the stage for a dancehall-heavy album. Luckily, Shakira proves herself more than capable of pulling it off. The track features her signature lyrical style, even impressively managing to incorporate \\"lycanthropy\\" the track. Aside from some fans complaining that the howls can get annoying, it is a very addictive track and a wise choice for lead single. \\"Did It Again\\" is inexplicably considered one of the weaker tracks on the album, despite being a personal favourite. Here, Shakira sings about repeatedly having the wrong taste in men, even including a married man (\\"How blind a girl can be/to miss you hide your ring\\"). Lyrically, this is one of the songs with the most substance and is almost reminiscent of material off her Laundry Service album. \\"Long Time\\" is a track that seems to have incredible potential that it never quite lives up to. It passes by as an enjoyable listen and a solid track overall, but doesn't capture much attention either. There is nothing wrong with the track per se, it just fails to stand out.    \\"Why Wait\\", on the other hand, quickly asserts itself as one of the stronger offerings. The production, one of many tracks handled by Pharrell Williams, is some of the most interesting that the album has to offer. This isone of the tracks that seem most like what one would expect of a Shakira album, with its Middle Eastern influences. Shakira's vocal delivery is confident and works to really sell the song. \\"Good Stuff\\" carries on in similar vein with the exotic influences, and the chorus is particularly strong. Like \\"Long Time\\", it fails to really establish itself as one of the most memorable available tracks but it provides solid album filler. \\"Men In This Town\\" starts out strong and remains that way through the verses, with Shakira on a search for a good man. It struggles, however, on the chorus when her vocals come across oddly strained, almost sound off-key in places. It degrades even further with parts such as \\"it's a suicide...\\" and the whole \\"fresh, I'm so fresh and so clean...\\" just sounding completely unrelated to the rest of the song. It's really a shame, because had it been more cohesive, it easily could have been one of the strongest tracks. Luckily, the verses are strong enough on their own to keep it enjoyable.    \\"Gypsy\\" is a fan favourite, although it comes across a little odd as one of the only mellow tracks in an otherwise dance-heavy album. It does make a nice change of pace, and is another track reminiscent of Shakira's earlier material. She here proves that she can pull off more folk-y music just as well as uptempos, although this is far from her best work. \\"Spy\\", on the other hand, proves once more why Shakira and Wyclef Jean need to keep up their chemistry. After the excellent \\"Hips Don't Lie\\", the two pair up again here to craft easily the strongest track this album has to offer. It's a creative track, everything from its lyricism to Shakira's trumpet-imitating vocals (listen to the track to understand). Her vocals on the rest of the track are some of the strongest on the album, and the slick production accentuates them beautifully. \\"Mon Amour\\" is another personal favourite, and is definitely comparable to \\"Don't Bother\\" and \\"Objection\\". Shakira is generallyat her best when playing the scorned lover, as this is when we tend to get some of her strongest, and most sarcastic, lyrics. Here Shakira sings about hoping her ex and his new girlfriend have a miserable time in France as revenge for breaking her heart. It doesn't sound like much on paper, but the delivery works impeccably.      Fans of Shakira's Spanish material will also enjoy the second half of her album, where she offers Spanish versions of several of the album tracks. \\"Loba\\" (\\"She Wolf\\"), \\"Lo Hecho Esta Hecho\\" (\\"Did It Again\\"), and \\"Anos Luz\\" (\\"Why Wait\\") are all just as strong as their English versions, perhaps even more so because Shakira still seems most comfortable singing in her native language. For the casual and English-speaking fan, these tracks may come across as unnecessarily repetitive, however some may enjoy the opportunity to hear familiar tracks sung a different way. One of the most unexpected gems is the Timbaland-assisted \\"Give it Up to Me\\", another track which many fans were quick to dismiss since it is different from what most would expect from Shakira. However, this song only goes on to show her talent at taking diverse styles of material and making it her own. While this track is clearly more urban than anything else the album offers, it never sounds out of place alongside the others. The remix of \\"Did It Again\\" with Kid Cudi is another decent version, but it was not really strong enough to merit inclusion. The original incarnation was fine on it's own. Shakira then ends things off with live versions of \\"Gypsy\\" and \\"She wolf\\", neither of which are terribly different from their original forms, rendering the end of the album quite repetitive.    Overall Mark: 4/5     It seems as though fans object most strongly to the production that Shakira's latest offering uses to back its tracks. Many quickly wrote this album off as another artist to fall to the dance music trend, ignoring the fact that her signature style was stamped all over the tracks.The biggest problems here actually lie in the limited amount of English material, with only a sparse 10 distinct English tracks. This leads to Shakira attempting to supplement and pad out the album by including Spanish versions, live versions, and a remix. While these tracks are all good versions, and the Spanish versions are certainly welcome for most fans, it makes the album seem awkwardly repetitive and only serves to emphasize how short it is rather than masking the fact. It's especially puzzling since Shakira's other two English albums were quite short as well, 13 (11, if you only include English tracks) and 12 songs each. It would thus appear that adding extras were to give the illusion of giving more value for the money, but the average fan will probably not be fooled. Nonetheless, the album does stand together as a cohesive offering and an enjoyable listen, repetition and all.

6300270424|5.0|The Song Remains the Same film is one of the most entertaining rock videos of all time. Despite the band's own criticism of the project, this film nonetheless captures a lot more than just playing in concert at Madison Square Garden in July, 1973. The film starts out with some violent scenes (shooting) which is a subliminal message of sorts to the band's critics, followed by some cherished footage of each band members' activities before embarking on their long tour. Sprinkled into the video are each member's fantasies that are presented in song format. John Paul Jones' fantasy is during NO QUARTER, while Page's fantasy is during DAZED AND CONFUSED, Plant's during THE RAIN SONG, and Bonham's during MOBY DICK. As one continues to watch this film, it becomes more and more obvious that the rules were loose at the Garden during the concert, as police and security guards were very accomodating to those who wanted to sneak in without paying. Also, illegal concessionaires got away with selling poses of the band members for quite some time, and it was Zep's manager, Peter Grant, who discovered them--NOT Madison Square Garden personnel, much to the displeasure of Grant. Grant goes on a tirade, accusing the MSG personnel of getting \\"kickbacks.\\" I'm emphasizing this scene because it adds to the entertainment value of the film, as this scene has humor in it. Grant leaves nothing in the bag when addressing the MSG people. He very well may have been the star of the film!!! Finally, Zeppelin winds up losing over $200,000 from a safe deposit box at their hotel. So, this film has a little bit of everything, including a very undersized shirt that Robert Plant is wearing!!! The Song Remains the Same is a very cool film that depicts an early 70's hard rock band's lifestyle, and life in general for fans, as well. This is nostalgic Led Zeppelin.......a time when they were at their creative peak. 10/10
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|...what people say.  I don't care if Dan Brown isn't a great writer. Don't care if his grammar stinks.  What I do care about is that he is an outstanding story teller and no other author before or since has made me think and seek answers like Mr. Brown has.  Every one of his novels have sent me to researching; learning more about the world and it's secrets. I highly recommend this installment of the series.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|This is by far the worst solo artist CD release. If this CD is supposed to be a crossover appeal to mainstream, than maybe she has succeeded because it definitely does not appeal to true hip hop fans.

1595141979|5.0|From my blog: [...]    May have spoilers.     As much as I love all the books in the Vampire Academy series, I have to say Shadow Kiss is my absolute favorite. Not only is it my favorite Vampire Academy novel, it is also just one of my favorite novels in general. Richelle Mead completely outdid herself in this novel. It makes me laugh, cry, be happy, get mad, everything a great book is supposed to do.    While mourning the loss of her friend and classmate, Mason Ashford, Rosemarie Hathaway expects life to just go on hold for a while, but everything keeps continously moving around her. So when she learns that Victor Dashkov, who kidnapped abd tortured her best friend Lissa in the attempt to save himself from Sarcovskys disease, has yet to have had a trial, it's obvious that she and Lissa should go, right? But that's not what everyone thinks. Along with Victor Dashkov, she has yet another problem. The effect of being shadow kissed - and they are not pretty.    Shadow Kiss is such an amazing novel. It has a shocking ending that will bring you to tears. One of your favorite characters may not make it out of this book alive.

Mere words cannot convey the enjoyment the reader will receive from this book. A new discovery reveals itself with each new reading. It leaves one wanting more. I like it so much that I bought two of them.
B0025KVLSI|5.0|This is my favourite beatle album.  I had the American version of these songs when they first came out, and loved them, and then discovered they were originally together on one album in Britain.  Does it get any better than that? This is the Beatles B side album (they famously loved to consider B sides) and their real homage to the C&W world (others were devoted to the girl groups, etc.).  This should be listened to with the Beatles on the BBC album.  It is totally quirky,  and full of songs that are not originally great (Mr. Moonlight?) but who had ever heard them until the Beatles went after them?

B002PMV9FG|5.0|Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince opens with several Death Eaters, flying through the air while enveloped in plumes of dark mist (like the children of Lost's smoke monster), wreaking havoc in the world of muggles.  Not only do they bust up a magic shop, but they also down a bridge in London, killing untold numbers of pedestrians.  If you had any doubts that The Half Blood Prince would continue the sinister atmosphere of the previous installments, then the first few moments of the film should put those doubts to rest with a swift knock to the head.  This time out Voldemort is at full power and his minions have free reign over their world and ours.       Each Harry Potter film contributes one piece to the overall puzzle regarding Voldemort's past and Harry's role as his Achilles heel (or would he be the arrow that can pierce the Achilles heel).  In The Half Blood Prince the new Potions professor, Horace Slughorn, holds that next piece.  Dumbledore recruits Slughorn for the upcoming school year in hopes that he will divulge a conversation he once had with Voldemort, known at the time as Tom Riddle, before his transformation into pure evil.  Slughorn views his job as more than just a teacher in a classroom.  He also establishes a coterie of young wizards and wishes who he believes it is his duty to fashion into adults.  Harkening back to an earlier time, Slughron is the type of professor who would call the special something he recognizes in these students as \\"character.\\"  In a bit of espionage, Harry must creep his way underneath Slughorn's wing in hopes to uncover the secret conversation.        This time around, the melodrama of high school dating is pushed to the forefront, but unlike in previous films these aren't moments the viewer must endure to get to the world of magic but rather enjoyable in their own right.  The appeal of the Harry Potter series has always been its marriage of fantastical adventure with the everyday drama of grade school.  But until The Half Blood Prince the quotidian half of that equation has always paled in comparison to the otherworldly.  One of the joys of this lengthy series of films has been the evolution of the three main actors from passable children stars to the ideal embodiment of their characters.  The Half Blood Prince also provides all three actors some great ensemble and individual moments to work with.  Much of the high school plotline stems from a love triangle between Hermione, Ron and Ron's new squeeze Lavender.  Just as Hermione has come to realize her feelings for Ron, he has found someone new.  (Although, I just can't picture those two getting old together.  I imagine Ron wearing a wife beater in front of the television while Hermione fetches him another Natty Light from the fridge).  Harry, likewise, reaches the age where he's ready to start dating, but has yet to recognize Ginny Weasley's longtime crush on him.      Perhaps the most ingenious aspect of The Half Blood Prince is how the minutia of high school life becomes a major plot point.  We all remember the used textbooks that were seemingly passed down from time immemorial and filled with scribbling, often obscene, of different penmanship.  Well, Harry discovers one such used textbook for his Potions class that contains perfections on even the textbook's recipes as well as some other magical tips.  As a reader, I absolutely love the central place books take in the world of Harry Potter, from Tom Riddle's diary to the importance of the library (Hogwarts just wouldn't be Hogwarts if they had the internet).  As a blockbuster children's author, J.K. Rowlings appears to be establishing physical books as objects of value that are just as magical as any spell or potion.    The Half Blood Prince is the film where all of the elements of a Harry Potter film--the ingenious magic spells, the battle between forces of good and evil, the childhood romance--all finally come together, like a supernatural potion, into a perfect brew.  The genius of J.K. Rowling is that, instead of writing sequels for a new wave of eight year olds every other year, she let her books mature with her audience, allowing her characters, plot and prose all grow along with the children who may have read the first book when they were even younger than Harry in his first adventure.  In The Half Blood Prince, for example, the character of Draco Malfoy, who had always been a nasty little pipsqueak, must decide whether he is more loyal to Hogwarts or to the Death Eaters.  In earlier installments it was always clear that Draco served as one of the villains, but as the stakes have risen, even the more wicked characters have trouble contending with the consequences or their actions.    Likewise, with each installment the films have displayed stunning visual complexity to match the emotional density.  And the visuals for The Half Blood Prince are perhaps some of the best of the series.  The director, David Yates, utilizes the byzantine angles of Hogwarts castle to cut and dissect the space between multiple characters, illustrating the levels of intrigue that are simultaneously occurring at the expansive Hogwarts compound.  The framing owes much to Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth, another film that takes place within the cold confines of a castle.  The color palate of the film mimics a daguerreotype tan, giving the movie an atemoporal timelessness.  The world of Hogwarts has always been a bricolage of differing time periods, combining medieval signifiers, like wizards and castles, with memorabilia from the 1940s.  To move from the world of the muggles to the world of magic is as much a movement in time as it is a movement in space.      It is often cited as a critical truism that The Prisoner of Azkaban is the best of the series (although, this is not necessarily the case for fans of the book).  I can understand why so many critics make this assertion, and The Prisoner of Azkaban is indeed one of the top films of the series, but I truly believe that The Half Blood Prince takes the prize for the best film in the franchise.  Azkaban is a success for two reasons: 1) it was the first instance of a textual and emotional maturation of the series and 2) the film stripped away much of the grade school drama that had gummed up the works in past installments, making the first Harry Potter film that felt like a large scale blockbuster, even if its running time was slightly shorter.  The reason why The Half Blood Prince is an even better film than The Prisoner of Azkaban is because instead of hiding from some of the soap opera elements of past installments, the film chose to strengthen those aspects of the story, making the viewer just as concerned with who Harry might end up dating as they are with whether or not Harry and Dumbledore will find the correct enchanted object to stop Voldemort.  With the sixth film in the series, director David Yates has finally positioned Harry Potter as a fantasy world of cinema to be considered alongside the likes of The Wizard of Oz, The Lord of the Rings, and The Princess Bride.  You might disagree with whether or not these films deserve a place next to these esteemed films, but as the series draws to a close it is impossible to ignore their place within the genre of fantasy.
B004498KPU|4.0|The top reviewer said it all best and others have talked about the aspect ratio, so I won't delve into that, even tho they are major complaints and do ruin the enjoyment. But I feel compelled to comment because as a long time Michael Jackson fan it was and has been extremely difficult to deal with his loss. He was a true work of art to the world and was never appreciated the way he should have been. People hated him for such horrid reasons--they hated the way he looked, he loved being child like, he loved kids because he never got to be one, he was black (yes, that is a reason) and he had incredible influence and power.     That said, Sony *cough* money mongrel murderers *cough* had a chance to really give their fans a true testament to the genius of Michael Jackson. This set is very pretty, I love the cover and such, but sadly you do feel a little bit of the disinterest that Sony has in giving us a real 'Vision' of his talent. Michael is gone now, so for them to come out and boast another box set we should get the most ultimate that we can get.     There is no excuse for 'Ghosts' being in its short form. None at all. Not only is that a very overlooked and mostly unknown piece of genius, it spoke a lot of what Michael was going through being mocked and humiliated, and now more than ever we need something in his OWN words. Even with the obvious undertones in the short film, That short film is brilliant, I only saw it once and it deserves to be seen again.     Somehow, some making of videos should have been included, where is the making of Thriller?! and I'm sure there is something on 'Scream' lurking around. Oh sorry, that's coming later to get more money.     Anyway, all versions of BOTDF should have been included as well. And the true cut of 'Black or White' should have been in there--with racial slurs and all. That was Michael's 'Vision' in the beginning and we all know the back lash he suffered from that fall out.       THINGS I'M GRATEFUL FOR:    I'm happy to see the prison version of They don't really care about us. That is a great video and it was pretty much banned and forgotten.     Love seeing 'Say, Say, Say' I know a lot don't care for it, but I love the song and Michael is a cutie in the video. It is hard to find elsewhere.     'Can you feel it' is another gem. I know some may think why pull this one song out of nowhere to be included, but it is another hard to find video with him and the brothers. Not to mention a really great song. Happy to have it.     \\"Who is it\\" The vision of David Fincher still has us scratching our heads. I don't think people cared for the abstract expression this video left us with. Nor did they care for a Michael Jackson video where he half appeared and did no dancing whatsoever. This video is confusing, but Michael looks luscious and it is a rare one indeed.       Also, as someone mentioned, some video quality is not as good as others, yes, this refers to 'Billie Jean' and 'Don't stop till you get enough' Sad but true. I'm not 100% sure why, they couldn't transfer it properly, not sure, but it's not as sharp. Sound is great however.     While most already have #1s and the 'History' DVD's one might say 'why do I need to rebuy all his videos again?\\" Well, you don't. Which is why this set is a hit and a miss. I have one History DVD and that gave me a handful of videos I have already. There are some goodies, which includes the lovely thick booklet with delightful photos to go along with every video including the names of the directors and production date which (for me anyway) I found useful.  This still does not make me feel like I am holding a 'lost treasure.' Even with 'One more Chance' which was hard for me to finish.     That video felt rushed and incomplete and it is just difficult for me to enjoy it, even if he does look happy.  Michael was well on his way to giving us so much more of himself and this is proof of that, he was working on new music and it was coming, so I'm sorry but I can't go into that video, it's hard for me to watch it more than once to give more of a review.     The biggest selling point is really just having all his videos together for safe keeping. I will say that--for now--this is a really good video collection for him and pretty much the only true one out there. If you want all his vids in a one stop and shop get this, it's not too pricey either. If you have all his vids spread out over other DVD's don't bother unless you really do just want them all in one place. I just can't say that the extras warrant you picking it up. Beautiful set but leaves a lot to be desired if you already have all of his videos already.    Overall, it makes me sad that Sony screwed him and his fans--AGAIN. But at the same time is wonderfully packaged and pretty to look at. Very convenient to own. I'm not trying to deter anyone from buying, but I think we have all done enough re-buying of his music already. Just think about what you already own and what you really want.     And as always, keep loving Michael!

1594488843|3.0|Daniel Pink's book, \\"Drive - A surprising truth of what motivates us.\\" is not as original as it sounds.<br />Most managers or psychologists will have read about Maslow's theory by now, and this is just another book describing this same theory.<br /><br />Basically, you need to go through several stages before it is possible to achieve your maximal potential. After the basic needs, an adequate salary, an organization needs to provide three opportunities for employees to maximize their potential:<br /><br />1) Autonomy, self determination; people have need for self determination and control of their own work<br />2) Training, mastery; employees want to excel at what they do<br />3) Goal, purpose; greater satisfaction is derived from greater goals beyond the scope of your own work<br /><br />At the end of his book he provides some suggestions are tools, of which many we have heard of before. Here are a few examples:<br /><br />1) Provide a day or some time for people to work on whatever they want<br />2) Set stretch goals, not too easy to attain, not too difficult, so they are achievable<br />3) Hire people who thrive in open organization<br /><br />Overall this book was not bad, and definitely a read if you are new to the topic, but it did not surprise, nor did not address or resolve how to motivate people within the problems large projects run into.<br /><br />Often project scope is determined by market needs, not intrinsic interests. Experience is available and ready, or it is hired in from outside. Projects timelines shift, and more needs to be achieved in less time.<br /><br />This read left me without solutions to the practical problems we are all facing in the workplace when trying to motivate people.
B003L77TZI|4.0|My only dissapointment in this album is that the song 'California Dreams' is not repeated twice. I've heard her sing the song without the 'feat Snoop Dogg' and it is better in my opinion... [not a Snoop Dogg] fan. I would have given it 5 not 4 stars with the inclusion of a 'non Snoop Dogg' version. Even still it is an excellent album.

B003X2O6KW|2.0|Kayne West is the type of Artist that already going in that his musical Opinion of his talents and the actuality are night and day. on one hand he has some cleaver Arrangements that lend themsselves to his word play and Swagger play on words, on the other hand he comes up empty at times trying to get a particular point across and he will either sink or Swim depending on how stretched out said track is.  unlike previous albums there isn't a lead single or a standout hit song here and that for better or for worse keeps this journey of this album going.<br /><br />his biggest problem as a artist is thinking he has topped what he has already done,when in fact he is a strickly by the singles type of act. he has been able to blend styles and have moments and yet never quite finish what e starts. this album is a continue true to form formula he has used as his blue print.musically as a artist he wants to be vulnerable and yet maintain that swagger which while has it's place, simply isn't enough to a compelling album.  he migh have a legit greatest hits package but as far as  a studio album he continues to step over his own creations.
B003WTE886|5.0|Wow! What a great bunch of songs. Over an hour worth of great music. I liked Fearless okay but this one is definitely a step up. More personal and emotive. Its great. Get it!
B004498KPU|5.0|the man his music and vision and nobody ever put it down quite Like Michael Joe Jackson. the trip out thing, is here was a Artist nearly 15 years into his career by the time Music video took off. I mean the Man had already changed the course of Music as a Kid artist and then as a Adult artist with both Off the Wall and Thriller albums.  thing is he took the mini film of Music video to a whole different level. His vision took a cool song and gave it a whole new life.  his dance moves and creativity came together as one.  there was nothing with Creativity that the Man could not do. he truly had that Once in a Lifetime \\"IT\\" that combines and connects.  bottom line and I might add the songs stand up well regardless of a video or not because Don't Stop til you get enough is a Jam period. that video looked like it was shot at the local carnival, however MJ made it cool rocking the tux. same with ROck with you where MJ was doing the dance the Rock.<br /><br />Beat It good combination of modern and West Side Story. THriller was cool and on point.the Break down of dancing and the instrumental are cold. the Billie Jean Video was cold and it worked with the Mystery and Aura. to me the Bad era was where the MJ Video Pioneer era truly took off,he really stepped up the game from there. He Brought the Streets and everything else in between to the stage.<br /><br />he influenced all acts that came after him with the music and the visual concepts and images. remember the time  was a great concept and the laid back feel of Stranger in Moscow.  so much irony for the video for \\"One More Chance\\".<br /><br />i Miss the Brother and he made me a Music fan and not a day don't go by when I don't think about him,because he was that Dude. Trendsetter, Ground-Breaker, Creative Knight and the Jackie Robinson of Modern Music he truly paved the way and opened a whole lot of doors for so much.<br /><br />He was a Creative very gifted Muiscal Genius.
044022425X|5.0|I do not agree with those reviewers who say this is a \\"weak link\\" in the series or not as good as the first ones. I found this 4th book (another \\"all day sucker\\" at over 1000 pages), to be a richly woven tale with great depth and lots of twists and turns as the story moves to 18th century America several years before the Revolutionary War.<br /><br />And this one not only continues the great love between Jamie and Claire, but adds the story of their daughter Brianna and her love Roger. I did find the latter two to be a bit hard to grasp, but I did not think Roger to be too much like Jamie, which some readers did. Perhaps it is just that we haven't yet seen enough of Brianna and Roger to feel like we truly understand them.<br /><br />Gabaldon does an extraordinary job of depicting life among the Indians and the slaves and the hardships the white settlers faced, particularly in the back country where the Frasers live.<br /><br />There are wonderful secondary characters that I came to love and expect to see in the remaining volumes. The story of Jamie's nephew, Ian, becomes one of heart rending interest and likely reflects what may have happened to some in that time. Lord John Grey is still in the picture as the friendship with Jamie continues.<br /><br />Once again, Gabaldon uses the \\"time travel\\" aspect of Claire's and Brianna's (and Roger's) being 20th century people to show what a change in lifestyle it would be for us to go back and live in that time. Finally, to see all the Scots in America after losing their homeland to England's abuses after Culloden was encouraging even though the reminder they had lost family and clan roots at the hands of the cruel English tugged at my heart.  Still, as this story drives home, England's loss was America's gain.
B003WTE886|2.0|got a chance to sit down and listen to this album and hear where Taylor Swift was going.the things she has  going for her is that she has a catchy sound and it compliments her vocal range and her subject matter. a Marginal songwriter thus far at best. i do wonder if she will ever expand as a Artist or will she be getting by with material that while catchy and works never expands her artistic range.  vocally she is alright as with songwriting.production is slick and it works.<br /><br />right now if i took her 3 albums and picked out the best stuff I might have One decent album and the interesting thing will be where she goes from here in the years to come. she is a interesting artist for the times and has that Commerical sound down. however is there anything else to match the overall hype? time will tell.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|This CD is amazing. Has sounds for all type of music lovers, heavy stuff, ballads, pianos, double bass, dueling guitars, screams, growls, soul singing. What more can you ask for. Definitely one of there best efforts. No filler songs whatsover. Amazing.
1401324029|4.0|\\"Naked Heat,\\" the sequel to \\"Heat Wave,\\" gives fans of ABC's \\"Castle\\" TV series a chance to dig deeper into the characters supposedly based on the show's cast. The writing is everything you'd hope it would be, the plot has plenty of twists -- including one or two that must've been suggested by Richard Castle's ride-alongs with the NYPD's most glamorous homicide detective, Kate Beckett -- and the grisly bits are well offset with humor. I've enjoyed both books so much that I'm planning on buying [[ASIN:B001G7RDAQ The Trigger Episode: A Novel]], a mystery that Tom Straw (the 'Castle' books' actual author) wrote under his own name. My one quibble is that I disagree with the decision by \\"Castle\\" to let Nikki Heat and Castle's alter ego, Jameson Rook, get so intimate so soon. I think a few hundred pages of anticipation would've been a better idea.
B002ZG98PA|5.0|I went with my seven year old daughter, mother and aunt to see this yesterday and we all loved it.  Disney/Pixar, as usual, did a fantastic job on the computer animation, 3D, characterization and appealing to all ages in this film.  The adults laughed several times and my daughter was on the edge of her seat more than once.  The \\"hero\\" had a slightly bad boy image but that only served to make him more lovable as he turned out to be noble in the end.  What a wonderful movie for all ages.  I will be adding this to my collection as soon as it is available on DVD, hopefully in time for Easter.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|When it comes to music (and hip hop in this particular case) there's room for the good, the bad and the ugly. Everyone should have their opportunity to enter the market, battle for clout, and live and die according to how well you bring it. Ladies and gentlemen Kanye murders it. PERIOD.     Over the years I've appreciated Run DMC, Too Live Crew, Too Short, LL Cool J, Boogie Down Productions, Snoop, MC Lyte, NWA, and the list goes on. I've enjoyed and had on heavy rotation the likes of Public Enemy, Rakim, Biggie, Eminem and Lupe and have yawned and found distantly interesting cats like Plies, Wocka Flocka, Soulja Boy and the G-Unit. But Kanye has elevated the game and evolved hip hop to the next level. And just to be clear I have fought (strongly) to not like this cat. I've like Kanye enough to not dis him but haven't been down with him enough to buy or even listen consistently to his past efforts. But THIS album is BRILLIANT. Kanye makes an album perfectly crafted as a work of art for hip hop in the 21st century. Complex, genre bending, groundbreaking, entertaining, honest, and flat out hot as S*&%!    Big ups Kanye. Those of us who have been in, with and supportive of the hip hop game since its inception thank you for this work that embraces the ugliness and the beauty, the shallow and the contemplative, the simple and the outlandish.     It's albums like this that give me a thousand reasons to be excited about hip hop and where it can go. Hip Hop needed a big needle injection of innovation and this was it! Mr. West along with Kid Kudi, Santigold, Diplo, the Gorrilaz, M.I.A. (and others) are taking the hip hop roots and creating entirely new beasts. LOVE IT.        Keep pushin' Kanye. Keep pushin!
0307266303|4.0|Great story, but some theories in last third of the book are a bit under-thought. Cannot go into detail without giving too much away. Read it to see.  Reading this book will make you want to run bare-foot through the snow!
B00005KAQP|5.0|This is a great, happy, movie.  Great music, good story, Very uplifting, and wanted it for my collection, just to have.  As is sometimes the case, it's the best of the \\"Sister Act\\" movies in my opinion.  Get it...you won't be sorry.
0385342047|2.0|I have read all the Shopaholic books and loved them, but was disappointed in this one.    Becky used to be young, silly and funny. But now she's an adult, she's a mother and what was cute when she was in her early twenties is now really immature and sad. It made me almost sick to read about how she put her daughter in debt (not serious debt to the bank, but still) and effectively passed her shopping addiction on to Minnie, lied to her family and friends and put on a huge expensive party when she was supposed to cut back on her spending.    Obviously the books are about shopping and about Becky getting in trouble and how she gets out of it, but I would like to see some growth in her character. She should realize she has an addiction and deal with it. I can't believe Luke is still letting her run around spending so much money, isn't he supposed to be the reasonable one?    In Becky's defense she did wear all the clothes in her wardrobe. And the storyline with Minnie and Ellinor was interesting, I'd like to hear more about that.     If there's a next book I'll read it, but I hope Becky matures in it. It's ridiculous to read about a grown woman being as irresponsible as this and her sensible husband letting her.
B004498KPU|2.0|I am a life-long Michael Jackson fan. Over the years I had been waiting for him to release a fully comprehensive, remastered set of his brilliant short films. Unfortunately, this project came about posthumously. Apart from the beautiful golden packaging and overall concept, I am not pleased with this product. Before ordering this product I was aware of some of its shortcomings such as the very shortened version of Ghosts being included but believed that the pros will outweigh the cons: wrong. The way his videos are presented in this set is a shame: the very thick black frame around many of the videos is the most irritating aspect. I don't really believe that the quality of these videos is better than others that I have previously seen. Blood on the Dancefloor is the remix version which is horrible compared to the original. Too many complaints to list here. This set could have been more than incredible if they had just put more effort and thought into it. MJ's videos are a huge part of his life-long career and very important to his artistic vision and legacy. If they truly cared, they would've done right by MJ and his fans.
0812973992|4.0|Cultural happenings so often grab our attention for a fleeting moment but even in the age of \\"too much information\\", we rarely get such an in-depth look at the \\"whole story\\".  \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" is another kind of \\"whole story\\"--the tightrope walking incident is a backdrop (although the story is indeed covered well here--I loved reading about the preparation and attention to detail it took to pull it off.) and the fulcrum for many other stories, all connected (albeit very loosely) to that incident.<br /><br />The writing is great.  It's at times funny, poignant, sad, thought-provoking, tragic and uplifting.  Some of the characters are so \\"real\\" that I felt as if they could be my neighbors, my friends.  While the book does have some stories that I felt were \\"loose threads\\", even those are well-written and serve a purpose.<br /><br />The theme of human connectedness is handled very well here.  The characters in the story are not only connected by the tightrope incident, they are connected in a \\"two-degrees of separation\\" sort of way and it's very interesting to see how the author manages linking people with such seemingly separate and disconnected worlds. In a post-World Trade Center Towers world, this is maybe more relevant and powerful than it could have been in 1974.<br /><br />I love books like this where I feel immersed in the stories of the characters and yet there still enough plot happening to keep it moving and interesting.  Definitely worth reading.

B000JVT1U0|5.0|This film is an obscure, beautiful, and eerie piece of art. It still remains a small cult favorite, and critics have called it the \\"Citizen Cane of horror films.\\" However, this movie is too complex to be lumped into that category of horror. The only reason that it is considered horror is because of the casting of Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt, regulars in the Hammer series. I urge any fan of underground/cult cinema to give this movie a try. It is an intelligent religious thriller, with a twist that even though you might see it coming a mile away, the execution of this twist is breathtaking.     In case you don't know the storyline, an overly religious police officer searches for a young girl on an island where its inhabitants practice pagan beliefs that are primitive, and threatening to the officer's beliefs. The officer does not only have to save the little girl from the threat of pagan violence, he must thwart his fear of the rituals that these people practice, both by tradition and purposely against his will.    The 2 Disc Special Edition is the version to get. This film has a notorious history of being distributed in various chopped up versions. Even though the 88 minute version (the one that is most readily available) is still good, this disc contains both that and a 99 min print(Oddly referred to as the 102 minute version) that restores many scenes of crucial value.      Just whatever version you choose to watch, make sure Nicholas Cage is not in it.

B0018QCXH8|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie, and there's no need to repeat what has already been said (descriptively).  I had one problem that made me uneasy.  I saw Daniel Day Lewis, but the voice I heard throughout was Sean Connery's:  not just the accent. It was if someone had done a study on all the nuances of Sean's voice and sought to replicate it.  Still a great movie, with a great twist at the end.  Reminds me of Master Poe's (Kung Fu) line (after he had driven off a robber): \\"Can any man afford so much arrogance?\\"
B002ZG976U|5.0|I personally loved this movie of Cher and Christina Aguilera. I feel that both have great chemistry together in the screen, and were correctly chosen to star in this very good movie. Christina plays a small town woman who is determined to make it big in Hollywood, and she sees her golden ticket when spotting the burlesque club. Cher takes her under her wing and is pleasantly suprised to see the singing and dancing talent that springs forth. I love how the movie has many musical numbers and dances creatively weaved into it. In some of the scenes Christina basically sings how she is a good girl (while gyrating in some very glamorous and provocative outfits).  I mean this with both respect for Christina and Cher, but if that good girl musical number in the movie is any indicator of how she is in real-life then I would have to say that Christina probably has a wild and fun side to her good girl side as well. Cher successfully plays a self-confident mentor who helps teach her increased wisdom. The movie also includes a wonderful cast of gifted models and dancers. I also think that a good job was done in casting the actor who plays love interest of Christina Aguilera (the very handsome and talented Cam Gigandet). I felt compelled to watch the film more because of Cher starring in it, and knowing that it is a musical (I now have an interest in watching more musicals). I am very glad that I took a chance on this movie, and I am sure that many others are going to be happy too. The music and dancing in the movie is so memorable and enjoyable that it also sparked my interest to purchase the soundtrack. This is a good movie to watch if you love Cher, Christina Aguilera, and/or musicals.
0385523912|4.0|It was a nice coincidence that I just finished reading this book just before Thanksgiving.  It left me thankful for the everyday luxuries and freedoms that I enjoy, and often take for granted, and wishful that a miracle could occur to help those on the inside of North Korea who are oppressed and suffering.
4770031246|5.0|I waited for this book since Makikoh Itoh announced it on her website. It's fantastic and better than I expected.    Her recipes are simple enough that someone who isn't a cooking master can make, but not so simple that people who want a challenge are left bored. They're all quick and make amazing lunches. I've made several of her recipes before and they are just fantastic.     It is definitely not the kind of Bento book with cute pictures of chara-ben and how to make ham and cheese rolls. No, no, it is MUCH more than that. It teaches you the basics you should know for making healthy, delicious lunches, even if you don't want to make them cute and fancy.     If you're interested in starting to make your own bento, stop looking and start here.
B0042U94UQ|3.0|The movie starts off VERY slow, to the point that we wondered if it would ever get funny, but it did.  Once the little girls are added to the mix, the movie gets much better.  I don't think it is a classic by any means, but the ending was very touching, and the voices were very well done.  The film was playful, but had a lot of missed opportunities for laughs, etc.  My young nephew really enjoyed it, but the rest of the room really felt that it was almost slow enough to turn off the DVD.
0307269981|5.0|I have never reviewed anything before, because I am not always able to put thoughts into written words.  But I had to say something about this book. After reading the first book I was really anxious to read this one, and it did not disappoint!  The is undoubtedly one of the best books I have ever read!  I could not put it down!  Larsson weaves a wonderfully complex story, with fascinating characters.  This book was better than the first, and if the third book is better, then five stars won't be enough!  What a tragedy that there will be no more.
B0037RDPEG|1.0|selfindulged author who has very little to add to humanity.  it is all about you and not very interesting. may be pictures of the food and scenery could have prevented me from flipping the pages.
1416550550|4.0|Having read [[ASIN:1416550534 The House at Riverton: A Novel]], Kate Morton's debut novel, a few months back and enjoyed it, I was anxious to read her second novel The Forgotten Garden.<br /><br />The Forgotten Garden weaves together the story of three women: Cassandra, an Australian woman, her grandmother Nell, and Eliza, a writer of fairy tales.  The novel opens in 1913 England where a little girl has been left on the deck of a ship and told not to tell anyone her name.  The woman who left her, she knows only as the \\"authoress\\", has instructed her to hide and wait. When she is discovered on the deck of Maryborough Australia wharf, the couple who find her have little to go on except for a book of fairy tales that she carried in her small suitcase.<br /><br /> In 2005 Cassandra's grandmother, Nell dies and leaves her a Cornish cottage. Cassandra is also given a small suitcase containing fairy tales by Eliza Makepeace. In addition, she learns that her grandmother never knew who her real parents were. Cassandra, devastated by the earlier deaths on her husband and sons and now her grandmother, travels from Australia to the remote estate she inherited in Cornwall England to try and solve the mystery surrounding her grandmother, Nell's past. As Cassandra unearths the secrets of her grandmother's past, she in turn is able to make peace and move on with her own life.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS: The story jumps around quite a bit in both place and time, and for some this may be confusing and off-putting.  The clues revealed throughout the book make it relatively easy to figure out the mystery.  I found the detailed maps on the inside covers of the hardcover edition an added bonus that was great to refer back to. I liked this story, but did not love it.  I think it is one of those books that you need to experience for yourself and decide.<br /><br />RATING - 4/5 stars
B002ZG999U|1.0|I understand that this movie isn't supposed to be very serious but I would still rank this as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm would be pissed if I had to pay anything more than 99 cents for this horrible movie picture.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I can't tell you how great this movie was! Of course, the book is way better than the movie. Steven Spielberg did a great job depicting the characters and the special effects. It really made the event come to life. For the most part, the movie did justice to the book.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|The worst comments I see with regards to this movie come from both sides of the remake debate.  Some argue that it should never have been remade because they are fans of the original.  Other argue that it shouldn't be remade because of the concept.    If the concept offends you, pick up your opinions, there's the door - now leave!  Don't turn around, just go!  I've had enough of the 'it's bad because it's a rape movie' bull.  If it's not your cup of tea, so be it!  I probably feel as strongly against 'Sex & The City' but you don't see me shooting those fans down because of taste!    Okay, am I good to continue now?    So you're either a fan of the original, new to this movie, or just interested.    Good!    If you're a fan of the original, then I honestly can't tell if you'll like this movie.  I HATED the original.  I felt it had a very good premise that was poorly executed and in the end just came across as offensive (by the way, I'm female).  I thought the concept was good but the manner in which the protagonist went about her revenge was stupid!  If a woman has been raped, the very last thing she'd ever be comfortable doing is stripping off in front of the very men who raped her, no matter what her end objective may be!  At this point the original made me angry.  There's only so much believability I'm willing to sacrifice when I watch a movie - and I'd had enough.    So when I heard this movie was being remade, I was actually quite intrigued.  Again, I believed the premise was a good one and I was hoping a new writer and director could do it justice.    They sure did, and some!    The rape scene is brutal and it is hard to watch.  However, at the same time, it's not as bad as some make it out to be.  I felt it was a perfect balance.  It showed enough, without going too far that I felt too uncomfortable to watch any more.  There's enough there to shock you and have you empathize with Jennifer when she starts her revenge.  It is definitely not as bad as 'Irreversible', a movie I, and many others in the same movie theater, ended up walking out of.  When I saw this movie, no one walked out!    I also felt that this movie was never titillating.  Nudity is actually kept to a minimum and the only time we see Jennifer completely naked is following her rape where she is in an almost catatonic state, just trying to get away.  You'd have to be the sickest of the sick to see anything but the character's fear, humiliation and determination in this scene.    I found the portrayal of the characters to be much more believable this time and the mentally challenged character, Matthew was a million times better than the original.  They ditched the dorky glasses (no missing lenses in this film at least) and decided to get someone who could actually act instead!  Matthew is played with such childish vulnerability that you find yourself conflicted.  He does rape Jennifer, but it was peer pressure and afterwards he feels so guilty that he's effectively torturing himself without Jennifer's help...but, he STILL raped her!  It's a tough one!    A great addition to this film is the sheriff.  At risk of spoiling the movie, I'll leave it at that but his involvement in this new version was a fantastic move.      When Jennifer's revenge comes into play, you could find yourself often wondering if she's going too far.  I never found myself empathizing with the rapists (other than Matthew, to a degree) but I often just wanted her to get it over with already.  That enough was enough.  It was nice to see such extremes on both sides, to see what people are really capable of.  What do the rapists REALLY deserve?  How far would YOU go?  No one could possibly know unless directly in Jennifer's shoes, so even if you find yourself questioning the extreme nature of her actions, you'll find yourself equally stepping back and thinking - well this is her party, who am I to question how extreme she should be?    The best feature of this movie, though, is that it's a smart movie!  There's some nice symbolism in there and it's quite clever the way it plays out.  What makes it even better, though, is that you don't have to get any of this to 'get' the movie.  It was like an added bonus!  In the same way adults watch 'The Simpsons' and get the adult humor, the children who don't get those jokes don't dislike the show any less - they just don't get the whole picture.  I don't want to spoil the movie so I won't go into details but the final death was sheer genius.  The reversal of roles determining who's the one pulling the strings now!  Loved it!    When you hear the work that went into this independent movie and the amount of pride the people involved have in the outcome, it's only fair that you at least give it a chance.  I think a lot of people would be pleasantly surprised.  The reviews on here are not reminiscent of the reviews out there on the internet, where there's a lot of well placed praise for this movie.  Amongst its target audience and horror fans, this movie delivers.    Unfortunately it had a limited release, it didn't even show in the movie theaters where I live (I was lucky enough to visit LA during its run there) but I'm looking forward to the DVD release so my friends can finally see it!
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|Give your heart and soul what it needs!! This music is real!!! Kid Rock has the knowledge and know-how to what music is all about!!   Buy this album!!!   This music is pure and no greedy 3-piece suit a@#holes were there to mess with it!!   Rock on!!
B004469BQA|2.0|This new album is a great disappointment. Joe is my favorite guitar player with Steve Morse and David Gilmour. I own all of Joe's albums and have liked them all for different reasons. But I just can't bring myself to liking this one. After a few listens it seemed to have immense potential, but then the more I listen the more let down I feel. I would compare it to a sweet wine that is very seductive at first but has no body and length. One glass and you're done. The album feels empty.    I take my reviews seriously and it truly saddens me to say that Black Swans is my least liked album. I have been so bothered by this realization, that I decided to compare Black Swans with my previously least liked album from Joe. After listening to that one, I realized that Black Swans was definitely uninspiring. Almost lame. I know many of you will scream, but read the next paragraph.    One song will summarize the entire album: Pyrrhic Victoria. Great intro, a contagious crecendo, the intensity is building, it looks like a masterpiece at first. But then, Joe strictly repeats the first part in a second identical part, with a connecting solo that has absolutely no fire to it, no layers, no intricacies, no melody, no mojo whatsoever. This is unheard of. The solo actually totally breaks the song and destroy the first part that had serve to build a fantastic mood. Let's compare with a song like One Robot's Dream (Super Colossal): listen to the solo at the end. It is sizzling, on fire, intense, inspiring. Listen to Redshift Riders: inspiring riff, a \\"vocal\\" solo like Joe's unique trademark, mixing of a new riff into a second solo, which lift the song to a new plateau, then a smooth transition to the main riff and an outro solo that propels the song to a climax. Three solos in one song, each unique and building on the previous one. The \\"vocal\\" solo of A Cool New Way for example is very melodic and takes you on a journey, with acceleration, pace building phrases, complexity, space, heart,which ends in a transition to another solo, grittier, that takes off, speeds up, mesmerizes, takes you for a spin. Beautiful. Take Crowd Chant (I am listening to it now): fire, passion, energy, talent, virtuosity, playfulness. Playfulness. These are marks of great albums and masterful compositions like only Joe is capable.    Black Swans has none of these.     The keyboards are a distraction. Venture into jazzy feel are badly composed and robs us from Joe's skillful riffs and solos. It is a let down, black like its title. Two songs have an honorable mention: The Golden Room and Wind in the Trees. I may keep the album for these two songs alone. Sigh!    When I like a new album I want to listen to it everyday for a month. After 4 times for Black Swans I got bored. Generally a couple of songs grab me strongly. In Satchafunkilus, there was two masterpieces: Asik Veysel and Andalusia. Give me one song in Black Swans that even come close to the composition of Andalusia, or Searching (Is There Love in Space). Time machine had Speed of Light, a totally hypnotic composition. And on and on. Each album had something different. Engines of Creation was a stunning effort is techno-rock with Cyborg Sex at the top.    I am truly disappointed. If you are able to enjoy this album, then good for you. I could not.
B004BSIJ9Q|2.0|Really there are few things that are \\"beautiful\\" about this album. The beats and the featured artists are really top notch but with this new album and Kanye's \\"twisted fantasy\\" does not come out so \\"beautiful\\". Lyrics are still condescending and pretentious. I've already wasted more than enough time on this review. Listen to it for yourself and you'll see that not one of the tracks stands out as a chart topper or anything special. R.I.P Kanye West.
1449389627|5.0|Words are cheap. So says Scott Berkun in The Myths of Innovation, Second Edition, published by O'Reilly. It's easy to call yourself, your product, or your organization innovative, but it takes more than calling something innovative to make it so. In this book, Berkun outlines and dispels ten common misconceptions about innovation. The second edition adds four additional chapters with advice for would-be innovators and entrepreneurs, moving from theory to practice.    The first ten chapters, carried over from the first edition, each delve into one \\"myth\\" commonly believed about innovation. Berkun's research is fantastic. He breaks down each misconception using examples as we've come to know them and the realities behind each innovation. Along the way, we come to learn that many of our romantic notions about how new ideas become indispensable products are, in fact, embellished by history. It's a fascinating read, especially for anyone who is familiar with the likes of Malcolm Gladwell or Seth Godin. Berkun's perspective, style, and copious research are at least as thought-provoking as the writings of these other authors.    As I mentioned, Berkun has made the second edition worthwhile by adding four new chapters, building off of the concepts presented in the first ten chapters and giving real-world, no-nonsense advice on how to apply those concepts to the reader's own ideas. These chapters propose a \\"simple plan\\" for becoming someone who could one day be known as an innovator. Note here that simple does not mean easy, as Berkun points out frequently that developing ideas, thinking creatively, pitching your idea to would-be supporters, and staying motivated can be challenging--and the ability to repeatedly rise to those challenges is what separates the innovators from the also-rans. Berkun's get-to-the-point writing style is perfectly fitted for The Myths of Innovation across the board, but it shines in these chapters. If you've read Gladwell and Godin and are ready tomove from getting inspired by the stories of others to being the one being written about and inspiring others one day, these chapters provide an excellent launch pad.    For those who are interested in further reading on the topic of innovation, Berkun provides an annotated, prioritized list of additional books that he read during his own research. But be warned--as the author notes, those famous innovators history tells us about did not become well-known by reading about innovation theory. If you're not ready to put some real effort behind your ideas, they are probably not going to come to fruition.    Note: I received a free copy of this book in return for my review, via O'Reilly's Blogger Review program.
B003YOZNBU|3.0|Sometimes a little anachronism goes a long way, and especially so in movies.  Who doesn't enjoy seeing low-tech versions of vehicles, weapons, or common appliances from modern times appearing within films set in the past?  Examples from past films include huge dirigibles, colossal flying platforms, mega frigates, and so on.  One weapon that fits this category is the automatic crossbow from \\"Van Helsing,\\" pretty much the only thing I recall from the movie, probably to my benefit.  Big is almost always better, no matter what the proponents of equivalence and social niceties tell you.  I'll admit, it was only the Gatling gun-enabled horse from the preview which drew to view this steampunk western.<br /><br />\\"Jonah Hex\\" is director Jimmy Hayward's (\\"Horton Hears a Who!\\") take on the graphic novel series of the same name.  Josh Brolin (\\"No Country for Old Men\\") plays Hex, a horribly disfigured bounty hunter who lives a life of hollow pleasures.  His pointless existence began after learning that the true target of his vengeance, Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich, \\"Rounders,\\" \\"Being John Malkovich\\"), had perished in a hotel fire.  Turnbull had earned Jonah's ire after burning Hex's wife and son alive in their home, forcing him to watch, and then branding his face.  Turnbull justified these horrific deeds because Jonah, a confederate solider, had betrayed his own regiment, killing Quentin's son Jeb in the course of events.  Further complicating these double-sided rationalizations is Jonah's belief that he was serving the cause of good in his betrayal of Jeb and the Confederacy.  The movie's plot grinds forward with President Grant learning two things:  Turnbull is still alive, and is planning to destroy the Union on the eve of its 100th birthday via the use of a country-killing Device.<br /><br />*possible spoilers below*<br /><br />This movie employs many nifty gimmicks to garner interest, but it'll depend on the viewer's taste how successful they tend to be.  For myself, I felt they enhanced the experience to a tolerable and even enjoyable level.  Without these little details, the plot, acting, and pace wouldn't be able to sustain the attention of most audience members.  For example, Jonah is not only an experienced bounty hunter, he is something of a necromancer, being able to speak with the dead.  He can coerce them to reveal the locations of his enemies, as well as other information.  Each encounter with the dead was very well scripted and filmed, but the pinnacle was when Hex spoke with Jeb Turnbull, Quentin's son who Jonah himself killed.  The moral and philosophical questions raised, as well as the mutual agony felt by Jonah and Jeb by their own equal but opposite set paths, felt quite mature for a film of this genre.<br /><br />Further, the gigantism involving many aspects of the movie--such as massive ironclads and cannon balls--was fun and added to the levity.  Several dreamlike sequences, during which Jonah internalizes and interprets his current struggles with Turnbull, deepened the moral struggles of our protagonist.  As I've mentioned previously, Gatling guns are always cool, and Jonah dual-wielding them on his horse worked in this film.  It worked in a ridiculous way, but then that makes all the difference, now doesn't it?<br /><br />*end possible spoilers*<br /><br />The relative merit of mature moral subject matter aside, this movie has more than a smattering of problems which tarnish Hex's silver spurs.  In a couple of scenes detailing Jonah's hunt for Turnbull, it is less than obvious to the audience where he is going, why he is there, and how he came to decide to go there.  Another reviewer commented that the movie seems heavily edited--if true, this would partially explain the confusing transitions.  This brevity permeates the entire movie, not just Hex's detective work.  His romance with Lilah (Megan Fox, \\"Transformers\\") feels about as satisfying from a story perspective as the water left in a sieve is as refreshment.  Jonah's rescue from certain doom is a trippy mess of confusing symbolism.  Too little time is lavished on Burke, (Michael Fassbender, \\"Inglourious Basterds\\") a fascinatingly sociopathic character with whom Fassbender steals every scene.  Finally, Jonah Hex's final confrontation with Turnbull (as well as his post-win \\"get the girl\\" scene) seems a forced and inadequate foregone conclusion.  One never got the sense that Jonah, his girl, or his nation were ever in any real danger, no matter how convincing Malkovich's or Fassbender's acting.<br /><br />Having been unfamiliar with \\"Jonah Hex\\" prior to seeing this movie, I was able to see and enjoy this movie without preconceptions one way or another.  One reviewer stated that Jonah is bereft of mystical powers in the comic series, and this detracted from the experience for him.  I can understand how it would, and am a little confused why filmmakers would insert these elements had they not been present before--no one better give my precious Scrooge McDuck comics any magical overtones!  However, as a veritable blind man to the mythos of the comics, I enjoyed Jonah Hex for how it was portrayed:  A spin on the classic Western movie featuring a haunted protagonist who resembles Eastwood's \\"Stranger\\" in more than a few ways.  It's not \\"Tombstone,\\" or \\"The Wild Bunch,\\" and maybe not even purist \\"Hex\\" on the silver screen, but it is good fun for an hour or so.  Many good-to-strong performances were enough to make me at least consider watching the sequel, should one be made.ippy mess of confusing symbolism.

1402210795|5.0|I read this book at least 30 years ago, the first time, and have remembered it as the funniest of the beloved G. Heyer books.  I read it again, recently, and found it just as entertaining as before.  I can imagine the author being in stitches, herself, with the tongue-in-cheek way she manages her characters, their speech, and the era and strata of society in which they lived.
B003YUC2FE|3.0|Have to agree with the other reviewers.  Wish I would have bought each one individually.  No way to keep the dvds organized or for the kids to easily find the movie they want.  Will have to purchase a case to keep them organized, irritating!!!
0553805371|5.0|This book is so well written. I only have some reservation about how the author mentioned 'life'. I think Hawking ultimately refers that to 'life form like us'. Other than that. This book is as well written as Brief History of Time, yet its material is better.
B00456H5LC|4.0|I love the melodic tone of this CD.  Grenade, Just The Way You Are and Marry You are beautiful. By the way, if you like Marry You, check out the Glee version. The reggae beats are nice and Count on Me is very cute - almost like a children's song.   But when looking for some originality, I find that many of the songs are \\"sound alikes\\".    Runaway Baby sounds like Bang Bang (She Shot Me) by K'Naan  Count On Me sounds like Somewhere Over The Rainbow by Iz Kamakawiwo'ole  The Other Side sounds like Runaway Baby on his own CD only with a slower rythme.
B001U3Y5XE|2.0|I am a HUGE lego enthusiast and I was very excited for this game it looked really fun!    Well I was very quickly very disappointed!  What this game absolutely must have to be any fun is a guide that tells you how to make the structures on the game cards!  Even the level 1 easy cards I was struggling to build.      Given the pictures on the box I was looking forward to all the cool models I thought I would learn how to make.  What I quickly found was unless you know how to create models yourself without instructions the game is pretty frustrating.  I wish I had the imagination to build models that look like the ones on the box off the top of my head.  For me to enjoy this game at all I would need instructions for the pictures on the cards, otherwise its just not very fun.
0545265355|5.0|I just finished up Mockingjay last night.  I'm totally depressed the series is over.  I'm haunted by how it ended, not necessarily in a bad way.  I'm just trying to work it all out in my head.  This series is spectacular!  It really is.  I can't wait to see what the movie brings.  I also can't wait to read more Suzanne Collins.  Her characters come to life on the page.  They will be in my head for a long time to come and I will wonder about them as if they are real.
B0043A0PXU|2.0|In this CD her voice sounds very wavery to me and some of the harmony vocals (in, for example, the first track, 'Angels From The Realms Of Glory) sound processed or like it's a keyboard playing samples of her voice. Same in the second track, God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen; there is no way she is singing the harmony vocals that high - it's processed and it shows. In The Bleak Midwinter features an arpeggiating keyboard part that is supposed to sound like a nylon classical guitar, but it obviously isn't - what, they couldn't get someone in to play a real nylon string guitar? I don't know what's supposed to happening at the start of Il est né le Divin Enfant, but it's the most horribly discordant harmony. Even tracks like As Joseph Was A Walking have vocals (the main one) that grate on me.    I just couldn't listen to a whole album of this. It needs the digital processing removed and the addition of a nice background choir to make it even listenable.    For Lennox fans only.

B002ZG98PA|4.0|All the big pieces fit the Disney formula: princess in distress, lovable rogue, wicked stepmother/senior advisor, a few musical numbers, and a Jiminy Cricket character - Pascal the chameleon, my favorite to date in his line of descent. Like any good recipe, though, it's what they do with familiar ingredients that makes this dish especially tasty.<br /><br />Rapunzel, although she has plenty of the pining princess about her, wields a mean fry-pan, though. Maximus, a mighty battle steed, gets some great parts to play, too - some of his \\"scent tracking\\" moves are a riot. In fact, anything the animators could do to make this a visual treat they did beautifully, including all the characters' motions as well as the ever-present hair. And the den of thieves - well, they're nice thieves. As happened with the little mermaid and so many other old stories, the Rapunzel of the classic fairy tales might not survive Disneyfication. Well, it's a fair story anyway, with plenty of adventure but with nothing truly dark enough to upset the little kids that thronged  the showing I saw. As always with Disney flicks of this kind: good, but forgettable.<br /><br />- wiredweird, reviewing the 2D release to theaters

B001C4CI8U|5.0|It took me a long time to warm up to Fringe. I made the mistake of thinking that this was just a low rent remake of the X-Files. But I was mistaken: Fringe is brilliant in its own right. The The casting of each character was right on the mark -- especially Anna Torv as Olivia. Season one starts off slowly, as many reviewers noted, then builds up. Olivia kind of metamorphoses into a heroine with superhero abilities. I ended up getting hooked on the series in season two (late I know)...but I'm so happy I did.     The stories center around mad \\"fringe\\" scientist Walter Bishop --whose creations and unethical experiments have wreaked their havoc. I know I'm not doing the plot justice, but it's a series that's so much fun, I try to never miss an episode. The series -- which occasionally uses humor -- is not cheesy in the least bit.    I ended up buying both season one and two of Fringe on DVD. Season one includes the pilot, commentary from the writers and producers on different episodes, special effects (and how they were created) and other goodies. I love every character on this show, especially Olivia. I plan to purchase season three when it comes out. I just pray it doesn't get canceled.
B00447L4JG|5.0|I love the movie, always have.  But had to post how horrible the case it comes in is.  I wish it had come in a regular size, plastic case.    This one is cardboard and thicker than normal cases so it wont fit into a normal dvd rack.  Hate the case.  .  .  I had to come back and say that I just saw this in the store in a regular size plastic dvd case that looks just like the one pictured...  BUT the one I purchased a while back also looks like this in a picture but actually is the thick cardboard case that I hate so much.  Mine is what I would call 3d --Jack's face is puffed out of the background with the square (acting like a window) being cut out of the front cover flap.      Not sure what case it will come in if you buy here.    But no matter what you'll enjoy the movie!
B002ZG98PA|5.0|When we saw the previews for this, we expected it to be ok and at least mildly amusing, but we weren't optimistic that it would be anything we'd really love.  We were SO wrong!  We not only liked this, we LOVED it.    One of the complaints I've read is that the viewer had hoped to see in Tangled the same kind of irreverent humor that the Shrek movies are known for.  While I do appreciate well done irreverent humor, it is certainly not the only enjoyable kind of humor. The humor in Tangled is, by turns, good natured, slapstick, subtle, situational, and always really delightful.  We (both over 30) laughed a lot during this movie!  Another complaint I've read said that the dysfunctional relationship between Rapunzel and her \\"mother\\" might be rather difficult, complicated, or damaging for children to see and understand. Really?  Most people don't worry about their kids seeing Iron Man, The Chronicles of Narnia, Transformers, Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast (talk about dysfunctional relationships!), or any of a thousand other movies, but this one worries them?  I'm not even sure what to say to that...Except to tell potential viewers that it shouldn't overly concern them because many children will most likely recognize the dynamic from their own experience with a person like Mother Gothel - indeed we all know someone like this - and they may very well draw inspiration from Rapunzel's courage in finally standing up to her.     Another complaint mentioned the colors in the moving being dark - this couldn't be further from our experience.  Either the particular theater that person was in or the 3D viewing must've caused that person's experience because in our 2D viewing the colors were absolutely luminous!  I was absolutely enchanted by the colors and the vivaciousness and beauty of the animation.      The final criticism I'll address is the \\"lack of memorable songs.\\"  For me this was a good thing!  Personally I get tired of the characters bursting into song every fewframes!   When did animated movies suddenly have to become animated musicals?!  I'm glad Disney followed Dreamwork's lead in this case and seriously toned down the number and scope of the songs.   Overall, in fact, this movie felt much more like a Dreamwork's production than a Disney movie and based on the awesomeness of several of DW's recent efforts (How to Train Your Dragon for example) we think this is a good thing!    Bottom line we absolutely loved this movie. It's beautiful to look at, very funny, a good story, charming, uplifting, and thoroughly enjoyable.  As soon as it's available we will be pre-ordering it.     Oh, one other note, the voice work was absolutely excellent!  I didn't realize, until after the fact, that the voice of Flynn is done by Zachary Levi of Chuck.  Love Zach, love Chuck, love Zach as Flynn - hope he does more voice work.
B002ZG981E|5.0|The best movie I've ever seen, can't wait for it to come out on bluray, this movie def. makes you think, it's awesome, and at least for me watching this gave me a completely new outlook on everything!, I love it and love this life!!!!

B003YY7BTW|4.0|Very cute movie. Very entertaining. Not much depth pretty fast paced. The lovely Alex O'Loughlin is soooo dreamy and I love him now. Jennifer Lopez has done some good work in some movies but though she plays this character a lot, she is not believeable. Her character is not believeable and looks way to put together for someone in her circumstances. In some shots you can imagine they yelled cut for makeup and hair to come in. Other than that it was nice way to spend an afternoon.
0525951652|5.0|How could anyone not like it? So much history and the events leading up to and during WWI. I really appreciated the different aspects represented by the characters who were in the book. The research that Mr. Follett has done has made an incredible story. I was in France a few years ago and went to several of the battlegrounds that took the lives, both physical and emotional, of the people involved in the war of not only the soldiers on opposing sides but also the residents of France. The remorse that I felt was overpowering. Should I go back today, I think it would be even greater. My admiration to this author who gives us insight as well as entertainment. Look forward to reading the next two books in the series.
0399536108|5.0|This book draws you in quickly and inspires you to follow the path less traveled in order to achieve happiness. I found the advice in this book is similar to that in other books (7 Habits...) but delivered in a much more straight-forward and unpretentious manner. I will be reading it again very soon! I highly recommend it!
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I bought these after reading all the reviews on other headphones and comparing prices.These were recommended by many guys in the field of sound editing so that was for me .<br />When it arrived I couldnt wait to try em out . They come with a quarter inch adapter too so I could do all kinds of sound.<br />Comfort is ok , sound muffling you can still hear the outside with them on and others can hear it too .You have to crank the volume a bit to be oblivious . However for the money they are really good headphones. They are light and fold up into a sony bag which is nice . They seem durable . There is a small visible wire from the top to the phone itself on both sides though. I have not had them long so I dont know if they can handle a fall or if the curled spring wire will get tangled or any other problems.  It genuinely does seem ok though .<br /><br />I am not giving these up They really are a great product.I do remember the metal ones from the 60s and 70s they were heavy duty for sure . but if you wore them too long your neck hurt and these are light.
B002ZG999U|5.0|This was a very enertaining movie. The Expendables are former combat veterans who are now mercenaries. They take  on various assignments around the world for hire. This is a very rough group made up of Sylvester Stallone,Jet Li.  Randy Couture, Randy Crews, and Jason Strathan Dolph Lundgren goes from being good to being bad. They have been hired by a character played by Bruce Willis to conduct a mission in a South American country. The country is ran by a military dictatorship. Eric Roberts plays a cocaine baron who actually has a grip on the country. Stonecold  Steve Austin plays the role of Robert's bodyguard. He is brutal. The Expendables infiltrate the country and take  the forces of evil to task. The knife throwing antics of Jason Stratham are especially entertaining. This movie has  nonstop action and constant battle. This is a movie that you must see. I greatly enjoyed it.
B002GZQYMK|1.0|Let's go straight to it:  Lyrics such as \\"it's time that the fat cats had a heart attack\\" are borderline hate speech.  Wishing death on others for being different is never morally acceptable.  How they will all share a common heart attack is logistically foolish.<br /><br />Logic has little to do with the album anyway.  Successful people are described as alternately \\"lucky\\" and \\"greedy.\\"  Their role in the album is to destroy minds with abuse and lies for their own gain.<br /><br />Thankfully, a hero emerges in this album.  An unnamed woman is exalted to become the symbol of Muse's perfect future world.  She is described as an unfaithful and greedy bed-hopper who destroys hearts with false love and terrible lies for her own gains.<br /><br />Ultimately, she is the symbol for Muse at their apparent perfect moral state: harlots (sexual or commercial) who seek to destroy the hearts of as many people as possible in order to receive their victims' adoration.<br /><br />The album is so needlessly polarized as \\"us\\" versus \\"them\\", dead hearts versus dead souls that no reasoned alternative can exist.  Minus the ridiculous lyrics, a karaoke version of this same album would certainly warrant a higher rating.
0061673730|4.0|Just finished reading Robert Pirsig's \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\". Its an oldie from \\"back in the day\\" when I was a sophmore in college in 1974.  Its is a worthwhile read and Mr. Pirsig is a gifted writer with brilliant insights into human thought,reasoning,logic, emotions,feelings, our foibles,sadness,joy,what does it all mean,discussing a 3rd option as an answer to a yes/no question etc.I too rode on a motorcycle- a Honda 175 a bit around rural America- much much less than Mr. Pirsig- upstate NY, Maine  Quebec and Vermont mostly, around the same time as him.   For him it was around 1968, for me 1974-5, and his descriptions of the small towns I experienced are authentic , resonating and mirrored my own .There is much in this book that is difficult to put into words other than to say it is gentle, honest and authentic.     I will say though that as another reviewer observed , to me, Mr. Pirsig appears trapped  within the context of his own world view as he shows in his sometimes obliviousness to the fact that his 11 year old son has not come to the same conclusions about philosophy and life as his dad despite the fact that his son is 11 years old. As a parent with 2 sons on the mildest end of the autistic spectrum, at least in my humble opinion Mr. Pirsig's character seems to lack some of the knack of \\"getting it\\" as far as dealing with he emotions  of others. Its not for me to say, but perhaps he had a very mild form of Aspbergers Syndrome, which of course was not diagnosed back then.      In a sense this book is autobiographical as many of the events in it parallel events in Mr. Pirsig's real life. One can see that the power dynamic male/female was vastly different then. Likewise medicine ,diet and many other things have for the most part and for many people gotten better from 1974-2010 here in the USA.     At the same time, while reading this please be mindful that in real life Mr. Pirsig comes from the US upper classes. His dad was a law schooldean and he was/is ? a professor at a college. Keep this in mind because these advantages of birth /good fortune? along with a 170 IQ and some ambition too-to have given him  the leisure time to take a many week motorcycle trip across the western half of the USA while millions of less fortunate folks , get a paid  week off per year if lucky, toiled at unrewqarding jobs to put food on the table and keep a roof over the heads of themselves and their families.     Being mindful of all this people of all walks of life can  benefit, enjoy and learn from this book . Although this book  is far more upbeat, it shares  a quality with the Academy Award winning movie of 1969; \\"They Shoot Horses Don't They\\", in that this movie and this book, once read or viewed will change your view of things forever.
0061730335|5.0|This is one of those stories that makes you look at yourself a little harder and wonder what would happen if you really, really tried for something. It is an uplifting tale of a boy who has very little, but takes all that he has to make him and his family happier. You won't be disappointed with this read, but you may end up being a little disappointed with yourself!
B00007GZQZ|2.0|I bought this dvd in order to round out an order for free shipping.  I had high hopes.  I ended up fast forwarding through much of the film. I realize this is supposed to be a comedy, but the state of the house was so atrocious that I kept thinking--why didn't they have someone check it out first?  The redeeming parts (and the most funny, in my opinion) were the construction crew that fixed the house, the last scene in the film, and some of the other smaller parts.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Once again, Pixar has managed to create something that is both visually stunning and emotionally heartfelt! Toy Story 3 is a wonderful end to the trilogy of the toys we have all come to know and love. Almost all of our favorites are back and Andy is heading for college.     I don't want to give any plot away for the few and far between who have not seen it, but it has something for everyone - adults and children alike. Nostalgia for us grown-ups and great imaginative development for the kids. The story is engaging and will make you laugh (and cry). It is not too long for a toddler to sit through and enjoy, but long enough to give enough time to the development of the newest characters, and bring closure to the story as a whole.    The 4 disc set is a great choice if you have a blu-ray player and also travel with your kids - you have the blu-ray for home, the regular dvd for travel to Grandma's, and the digital copy for on the go!    We took our daughter to see this in the theatre and she has been asking to see it again ever since! She has watched the DVD at least 4 times since it arrived - all the way through, beginning to end!!    Pixar knows how to tell a great story!!! We can't wait for the next one!
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|No doubt this is a good series. But I compare this to Band Of Brothers and there is none. The format of BOB is head and shoulders above and much better than The Pacific.The personal accounts by the Veterans who were part of BOB at the beginning of each disc captures the viewer and draws one into the story at once. This does not happen with The Pacific. However it (Pacific) is worth watching but a little overpriced.
0061997811|5.0|Lush, busy, filled with delights and surprises.  This book is a steal; full of treats that more than compensate for the modest cost.  The tome reeks of the bizarre sort of arrangements of billings and posts the wizarding world seems to be caught up with, such as sideway headlines and very busy pages. The designers are the same people who did much of the set designing, and it is a madcap sort of book.    Every page is a delight and an adventure.  The wonderful actors reflect on their roles and how they felt about being cast in their roles (don't miss Imelda Staunton's reaction at being considered a natural for the role of Dolores Umbridge).    The movies are, of course, a pale reflection of the books; a memoir; maybe a Cliff's Notes production.  But this marvelous chronicle told me why, and pointed out the incredible magic that went into the production.      Like a high school yearbook, but chronicling a decade of these youngsters' lives, this is a memorable volume.    I so well understand now why the particulars of the various books were highlighted in the movies, and why so much I loved in the books had to be cut from the films.  This book is a true appreciation and reflection of the decade of concentrated effort it took to produce such a magnificent chronicle.    If you love HP the books, and have enjoyed the movies, you need this book to wed the media.
B003VPWXRO|1.0|I wanted to like it, but I got tired of the constant whining about 1/4 of the way through. (Poor me, I'm so fat, I'm so ugly - but I'm famous and a model and a TV star! But I'm so fat, and so ugly, oh poor me.) I'm sure Portia is a delightful woman, but this book reads as a very repetitive moaning session.

B002ZG976U|5.0|My husband and I took our 16 year old granddaughter to see this movie.  We  all loved it!  It was pure entertainment and so refreshingly unvulgar.  We loved the singing and dance routines and didn't have to be embarrassed.  I was worried that it would be vulgar and sexually explicit, something that we have too much of these days, and how wonderful to see that a movie can be done without that junk!  The actors were very likeable and the story had a happy ending.  I can't wait for the DVD so we can watch it again and again, just like Pretty Woman.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Got the book after seeing that Joey read it on friends and also seeing it on one of those 100 books oyu should read before you die. Everyone went on how it is a classic, and as I started i had regretted doing so... BUT I got so engrossed in the story, following, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy that I am so pleased to have read it. For something ot have been written so long ago and people still reading it today proves that a simple storyline, such as the simple coming of age story of famile, and friendships can go on in a timeless fashion anyone can pick up and enjoy!!

0553805371|2.0|I was disappointed because the early reviews mentioned spontaneous creation. Since I knew about conservation of matter and energy from my advanced physics classes in graduate school I was curious how Hawking would justify spontaneous creation.    The answer is, he doesn't.  He waves his arms and declares that gravity did it.
B0041EVYVK|5.0|This new record was worth the wait. As a devoted fan of Daniel Lanois, I wondered what was next for my favorite artist.   Trixie's voice is perfect for the rock 'n roll songs...nice to have some instrumental music too. I saw the band perform live in Boston.. what a show that was. This album really captures the energy and enthusiasm of Daniel and his friends.
0802130208|3.0|In Confederacy of Dunces, 30-year old Ignatius J. Reilly is put upon to exit the safety of his snug (though trashed) bedroom of his mother's home and find a job. The result is a cause-and-effect satire which is (apparently) a monument of American Literature. I didn't really like it. It simply wasn't my kind of book. Don't get me wrong, I got a few laughs...and I can understand how people with a certain sense of humor (those who love cause-and-effect satires like Seinfeld or those who like laughing at the inadequacies and hypocrisies of humanity) would really enjoy this book. It also has a little Freudian satire in it. I just found the characters really annoying (I know I was supposed to). Couldn't get into it.
B00447G2MK|5.0|A Day to Remember is back with another great album. I think after each release they keep getting better. This album sold a lot of copies in the first week out, the album debuted at number 11 on the billboard 200 charts. I'm not that surprised, because Homesick did really well. A Day to Remember stands out. I think they will be around for a long time. I think more people are starting to accept this kind of music, more than they used to. This album is one of my favorites of 2010.
B0042RUMG4|5.0|The lyrics hit the spot, and the beats are better than 808 &heartbreaks. Got the Deluxe edition, and my favorite song has to be runaway. The have an extended version of it. (:
B00157NQ7Q|5.0|To really \\"get\\" what Kelly was going for here you have to realize the whirlwind she endured after winning American Idol in 2002. She went from being a cocktail waitress (and a vacuum sales girl, zookeeper, Six Flags performer, movie theater girl, Subway sandwich artist, Jamba Juicer, Red Bull promo girl, back-up singer, etc.) to being a household name. As adept as she was at dealing with her rise to fame, after touring the globe relentlessly for two years with 2004's monster smash \\"Breakaway\\" she was burnt out. Her voice and body were completely overworked and it showed--she canceled several shows due to walking pneumonia and bronchitis. All the while she dealt with a painful break-up, a new relationship and the ending of that relationship as well. So, when it came time to work on her third album she had a lot to say.    This album is a reflection of all that. It's a 24-year-old woman working out her issues--it's not always pretty, it's not always articulate, but it is completely heartfelt and genuine. She pours her heart into these songs and when you're looking for some empathy in your music, this girl has boat loads of it. From the scathing indictment of \\"Never Again\\" to the rollicking garage rocker \\"Hole,\\" the frustration is palpable. And then there's a release with \\"Sober.\\" I think it's probably the best song in Kelly's catalog to date. Gorgeous production elevates a dreamlike, wandering melody to a soaring final chorus that hits you right in the chest.    Moments like that run rampant here--from the electronic studded lullaby \\"Be Still\\" to the heart-wrenching confessions in \\"Maybe.\\" But there's also pure pop fun. \\"Yeah\\" unleashes Kelly's inner sex kitten. \\"How I Feel\\" is a bubbling declaration of independence that could've topped the Billboard Hot 100 if given the chance. And then there's the hidden track, \\"Chivas.\\" It's easily a fan favorite for its sarcastic lyrics and lighthearted, charming delivery. She's not angry or bitter--she simply wipes her hands andpicks herself up with a laugh. It's the perfect closer to a roller coaster ride of emotions.     I've heard the same thing from several people--they bought the album, listened to it, didn't care for it. Months later when they were going through a tough time \\"My December\\" was exactly what they needed. This album lends itself to repeat listens. I can't count how many times I've played it--it's my favorite Kelly CD by a long shot (no pun intended). If you give it a chance it might be yours, too.
015601386X|5.0|I bought the book for my German class and it arrived in a timely mannor.  The book was in the condition that the revier said (new) and I throurly enjoyed the book.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|Everybody out there giving her four and five stars must not really be true hip-hop fans, because this cd is staight cornball pop!! Her cd had no beats, no beats what so ever.  Where are the beats, true hip-hop has some beats, something you can bobb your head to, this cd has none of that,and where is the lyrical content? Just a sense of making you want to run your car off the road, if you have to listen to her sing another hook!!  MY advice, buy J.Cole (Friday Night Lights)this cd is a classic, and you will not be disappointed, not only does he have the beats, but is lyrics will give you something to think about!!
B003YOZNBU|2.0|This review probably has spoilers.    I feel like this movie was a sequel, with us jumping into the action midway. I spent the course of the movie wondering what exactly was going on or why I should care about the characters. I actually went back to watch the beginning to see if I had missed crucial scenes, but I hadn't.    In the opening, Hex's family was murdered and he was branded by an evil John Malkovich, but this doesn't pack much of a wallop because we don't know why exactly this is happening, other than Jonah Hex stuck to his principles in war or something. This scene was supposed to be the crux of Hex's past and motivation, yet I thought it was pretty tame--I never had to look away and I'm quite wimpy. I'm not one for gratuitous violence, but perhaps going for the PG-13 rating was a mistake if the full despair of the main character wasn't revealed to us. For goddness' sake, his family was burned alive: I should have been able to feel his torment. However, the movie was quite violent at other parts and the director seemed to be indicating how cool this was by playing some sort of rock music and having Hex shoot guns that I'm pretty sure were not technologically possible at that time.     I thought the supernatural element had promise (Hex can apparently talk with dead people), but the background behind this was given less than 30 seconds in the opening sequence. In short, Hex almost died after his encounter with Malkovich and some medicine men almost brought him back but not quite all the way. I found this explanation inadequate.     Another aspect of the movie which was not fully fleshed out was Hex's relationship with Megan Fox's character. She is a quite gorgeous bordello worker who is in love with a man with severe scars. How did they meet? Why does she let him keep coming back for more? How exactly does he feel about her cavorting with clients when he's away? These questions were never answered. Also, Megan Fox does not require soft \\"glamour\\" lighting during her close-ups! It was quite distracting.     I've always thought Josh Brolin looked fiercely handsome in a cowboy hat. I was sad his pretty face got maimed, and even sadder that I then could not understand what he said in the rest of the movie because of his scars. Note to filmmakers: it is necessary for moviegoers to actually be able to understand the main character. It was also quite distracting to see a sinewy band of flesh appearing to hold his jaw together on one side. I just kept worrying it would break.     The inconsistent audio track drove me insane. I found myself constantly fiddling with the remote, turning it up to hear almost inaudible conversations, and then turning it down frantically when loud gunshots scared my cat and annoyed my landlord upstairs. So perhaps the movie had brilliant dialogue and I missed it, but I kinda doubt it.     Over the summer, I read a hilarious interview with Will Arnett and John Gallagher, Jr. which motivated me to watch Jonah Hex. (In the film, Arnett played the union lieutenant and Gallagher was his second-in- command.) It seemed like they would have decent roles: Gallagher was supposed to have a man-crush on Hex and follow him around like a puppy dog, and Arnett was supposed to be mildly jealous that his lackey admired Hex so much. As I watched the movie, I waited for this subplot, but Arnett only had a few scenes and Gallagher mainly stood around looking cute and concerned. I then thought if I rewatched their scenes and overinterpreted every line, I could see the relationships which had been described in the interview...This only left me confused, and I later found out that a ton of their scenes were cut. How sad, as both actors described in the interview the laborious process of learning how to ride horses for the movie. The film was 73 minutes long--how could they not have time for a subplot with a Tony-award-winning actor who grew facial hair just for the movie?! (Gallagher won a Tony award for featured actor in 2007 for Spring Awakening.)     Arnett is mainly a comedic actor known for his role on Arrested Development who also deserved more screen time, and he was convincing as a snarky lieutenant--I would have obeyed his commands without question. Although Gallagher only had like 5 lines, at least he said them loudly and clearly and I could understand what he was saying, unlike poor Josh Brolin. The movie was rather dry, and the subplot with the union soldiers could have added some humanity and humor.  I protest the deletion of Will Arnett's and John Gallagher, Jr.'s scenes and kindly request a director's cut of them riding horses and doing other soldier-like activities. In addition, some deleted scenes which actually added some much-needed character development for Jonah Hex would be appreciated.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I loved this book. It takes a lot for my to get involved in a book these days, but I couldn't put this one down. It really makes one see things from a child's perspective, but also the perspective of a person held captive. It also made me look at TV in a whole new light.
142311339X|5.0|Over the last year, I have aquainted myself on Rick Riordan's Greek Mythology books of demigods and their adventures. The first five books were amazing and with his recent release, The Lost Hero, is a continuity of the Percy Jackson books. In other words, this is the beginning of another book series; but with three new characters and plot twists. Without giving anything away, Ill give you a little bit to help you understand the book.    A teenage boy name Jason wakes up on a bus, not remembering who he is or who his friends are. Piper, his friend and \\"possible\\" girlfriend and his other friend, Leo. They all go to the Wilderness School for troubled teens. On a field trip, weird things begin to happen and they end up at Camp-Half Blood where hidden truths are revealed to them; starting an adventure they will never forget. Why is Jason's memory blank? What is so significant about his two friends and what do their hidden truths have to do with their quest? How bout that for a teaser haha.     I have to say that I finished this book last night and was amazed from beginning to end, I even figured out the culprit behind it before reaching the end, but I'll leave that to you to discover hehe. Yes, this book is meant for teenagers; but Im not afraid to admit that I'm 24 and read these books. I have been a fan of greek mythology ever since high school, always been fascinated with the stories. The way that Rick Riordan made these century old myths modern is in my opinion, very fascinating. When certain parts are reached and a discovery of greek mythology character is revealed, he also gives a background that explains the character but to a extent where the parents do not have to take the book away from them. Think of it this way: the myths are censored, but still stay true to the age old myths. Plus the three newbies get to ride a dragon made of bronze as the cover of book distinctly shows.    A few characters from the original series are in the book but do not join the quest,as they have their own quests to deal with. The battles in the book are written with great detail and gives your imagination a workout. I would say these books are for any age range, especially Greek Mythology lovers.    The one flaw of the book: when you get to the end of the book, it leaves you wanting more. Writing books is a delicate process and the way Rick wrote the previous books and this latest one, it takes time and planning. With taking Greek Myths and making them modern, take the time you need. The next book, The Son of Neptune (nudge nudge wink wink), comes out Fall 2011.    If you are looking for something interesting to read or you are trying to get your kids read while secretly teaching them, then this book and previous books are your best bet of enjoyment. It is Harry Potter, but with Greek Myths and magic. (no wands)
B003DT19F0|5.0|This movie is great. I bought it for my 3 year old granddaughter and she was so excited. She loves princess movies and this one mesmerized her. She sat through the whole movie and asked to watch it again. The animation and picture quality are excellent. I am glad Disney continues to offer high quality entertainment for all ages.
B00454U1NS|3.0|I have enjoyed P!nk since she got the party started in a very shaky and unstable post 9/11 world in the Fall of 2001.  Her rebellious and independent spirit have captivated and inspired me time after time.  Each album has had similar yet unique themes running through it which encouraged the listener to challenge their own issues around conformity, rebellion, love, and loss.  Through each effort P!nk proudly declared her outsider status, while clearly becoming more and more of an insider of the establishment she strongly reacted to early on.<br /><br />So it is disappointing to this listener how unbalanced this collection is, compiled by the rocker herself.  While there is understandably much time weighted in favor of \\"M!ssundaztood,\\" was it really necessary to all but ignore \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" and \\"Try This\\"? Sure, she has publicly stated her disdain for these albums, but hits such as \\"Most Girls\\" and \\"God is a DJ\\" are important parts of her artistic development, and certainly could have fit in nicely on this 60 minute mix.<br /><br />Additionally, there is an undue amount of space given to \\"Funhouse.\\"  Again, this is completely subjective, but were the songs \\"Glitter in the Air\\" and \\"Who Knew\\" really more deserving than \\"Bad Influence?\\" And where is \\"Feel Good Time\\" from the Charlie's Angels soundtrack?<br /><br />As with most truly talented artists, I am sure we are in for more greatest hits compilations in the years ahead with P!nk.  My hope is that a future double disc collection will embrace ALL of her efforts that have shaped her into the outstanding force she has become.<br /><br />--Damon L. Jacobs<br />[[ASIN:1600374492 Absolutely Should-Less: The Secret to Living the Stress-Free Life You Deserve]]
B001UV4XHY|4.0|Fine, I confess; I didn't like the last Harry Potter book so much. It seemed very rushed, and the characters development just seemed to have stopping. For die-hard Potter fans, this movie DOES follow the book VERY well; but it also makes the characters more believable.  For example, Ron is much more likeable in the movie. He's not perfect, but we can understand what Hermione sees in him. We get why he freaks out and why he's jealous of Harry. Hermione shines as a self-confidant, strong and smart gal more than ever. Harry is an understated character, but that works well. The casting is, as always, brilliant. Loved the casting especially of Bill and Mr. Lovegood.  It's been a while since I read the book, but as far as I can tell, the movie left very little out, such as where Harry reads the encouraging graffiti at Godric's Hallow. Some scenes were added; Harry and Hermione's dance scene is great; I like how their relationship becomes closer, not quite romantic - we really feel how they're, for a time, the only person the other has. The Bill and Fleur wedding scene was altered; it's interrupted by a Death Eater Attack (which I found annoying). There was more action here than in the book; I don't remember the fight with Nagini the snake being so long; if you don't like snakes, don't watch that scene.  Finally, another great thing about this movie is the landscape. I usually don't really notice the background in movies that much, but whoever was in charge of location was brilliant. Since the kids are apparating so often, they end up in completely different locations. From a snowy, sleepy town to the city to the beach, all the scenery is gorgeous.  I'll admit that, in the book, I felt lost without Hogwarts. This movie is VERY different from the others, but I actually liked it better for that. Because the characters and special effects were still brilliant, it just felt like going on a more grown-up, exciting adventure than before! Love the movie, can't wait for the next,and hope this review helps!

B000022TSH|2.0|I have to be in the minority and say this movie just didn't really hold my attention. The pace was excruciatingly slow. Jack Nicholson, perhaps because I have seen him in so many other movies, seem to be acting...like Jack Nicholson. The plotline, as mentioned by other posters, switches mid-stream from Water and Power, to the daughter-father dynamic. I enjoy hard-boiled characters, but this film just felt flat. All around. The cinematography was great though, but, like another critique said, it gave the film the uncertain time-period feel.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|I saw this in the theater in 1974 and longed to see it again ever since.  I wish I hadn't had to wait, but it was worth it.  For any old school Stones fan, this is a set of the best songs by the most musically talented line up greatest rock 'n' roll band ever.  Get it.
6300183971|5.0|If you're totally new to Dune, read the book first before seeing any adaptation.  If you've read Dune but haven't seen this movie yet, well, take into account that 1) it's David Lynch and 2) they were desperately trying to make this movie to be understandable to people who haven't read the book, and the attempt fails, because it's impossible to make this fictional universe understandable in under 3 hours.<br /><br />I saw this when it originally came out, and the first time I saw it, I was obsessing over everything they did \\"wrong,\\"  i.e. at odds with the book.  The second time I saw it, I could just relax and enjoy it.  I was very forgiving of all the weird little things Lynch throws in like heart plugs (which make no sense at all) and other things like weirding modules, which I believe falls under the \\"make things easier for the audience to understand\\" category.  \\"Why does the Emperor want to kill the Atreides?  Because the Atreides have weirding modules.\\"  See?  Simple.<br /><br />I'm rating this movie 5 stars because I personally like it.  However, I have to admit that it's a \\"bad\\" movie in the sense that the movie will not make sense to anyone who has not read the book, not even after repeated viewings.  As a film, the special effects, acting, sets, costuming are all impeccable (well, okay, the Baron's acting is a bit over the top.  Just a bit.)  You can tell they spent a lot of money on this thing, and when you read other reviews that say the movie \\"bombed,\\" what this means is that ticket sales didn't pay for the original investment, but surely now with video sales and rentals over the intervening years, I'm sure they must have made a profit by now.
B004AQR29C|5.0|Expendables delivers! in the style and spirit of the action movie.  Heros should be invincible, have an endless supply of ammo, and hammer the enemy into mush :) lol  This is the purpose behind the action movie. Escape reality! Even if it's only for an hour or two :)    Anyone self-absorbed enough to be critical of this movie needs to learn to keep their expectations realistic.    5 stars from me, simply because it was exactly what I expected it to be.... enjoyable.

0618918248|5.0|I can't thank Richard Dawkins enough for this powerful and refreshing book, which has probably done more good for us a species than any other book in the last five years. I bought this book as person indifferent to religion. Even though I was slightly aware of the horrors it has plagued the world with since it's beginning, I figured it was innocent enough for those who turned to religion for comfort and for life guidance. And then I began reading, shocked and slightly embarrassed for the many people of the world who willingly choose to be ignorant of the ways of our world and universe by justifying everything with supernaturalism. It's ALMOST unbelievable how religion has been able to survive for so long on this world. The persistence of religion through those hopelessly brainwashed religious fundamentalists lasts only as long as the fundamentalists themselves, and in our only recently globally aware society it hasn't got a place in our world for much longer at all. With the world wide web being little over a decade old our children are perhaps the brightest, most globally aware, forward thinking generation to grace our world and I am so thankful for that.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I bought 3 of these in various lengths and they all work great. I am using them for my digital cable box (fantastic for HD programing), my Blu-Ray player and my Apple TV and the picture looks great with all of them. Don't pay more for cables, anywhere.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|I had never heard of this show before.  I was flipping through channels and decided to look at it.  As one viewer said; it does seem like a movie.  It gave me chills and thrills.  As a horror fan, I was sold.  What happened toward the end of the show, made me cry.  All the chaos that was going on from the zombie attack was so emotional. I've seen numerous zombie attacks in movies before, but this one left me feeling sad.  I guess it was partly due to all the fun they were having before the attack.  Then all of a sudden, here come the invasion of killer zombies.<br /><br />I do intend to buy this whenever it comes out someday, provided the price is right.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I purchased this show at a great price of $12.99.  My daughter and I watched the whole series in one day, because it was so good.  I can't wait to find out what happens with the issues concerning the Officer, his wife, and the Officer's partner next season.  This show is explosive and has a great story line. Love the zombies.
B0000B1OFL|3.0|fun heist fantasy. cons: predictable; cliche-ridden dialog (\\"it's over when i say it's over\\"!). pros: good acting; the impossible fast driving and (small) explosions are not constant; no cursing and no sex scenes that will make you uncomfortable if you're with a kid.     (does Edward Norton always play this type of character?)
B003ZVJFFM|2.0|Slow, uneventful, and LOUD.  I was hoping that I could add this to the family collection of holiday movie traditions, but I was very dissappointed.  If you're going to tell such a familiar story as this, it better hold my interest and move quicker.  As one reviewer said, I didn't connect with the characters either.  I actually fell asleep at the beginning, only to be woken up by ghost Marley's howling and chain shaking.  Didn't finish and don't feel like I missed out by doing so.  Spend your money getting Polar Express on bluray instead.
B000KJT8IG|1.0|The picture is really not much better ,if at all from the conventional DVD and the sound is still only 2.0,save your money.
B002PMV9FG|2.0|Very good acting and direction; tight comedy cutting, without a doubt; very funny script; special effects - goes without saying.<br /><br />This Reviewer is not a HP fan or a fan of grandiose tales of magic and suspense and so this film/DVD left me wondering if cogent storytelling natuarlly plays a distant second to all the high-tech. wizardry to dazzle the eye but not inspire the mind - I have never witnessed a plotline which seemed intent on snowballing into total incoherence. Every couple of scenes we get an explanation of what we just saw. I thought Maggie Smith, as one of the School's Administrator's, would clear up some of my confusion.<br /><br />Maybe it's a formula I'm not used to - a genre of the \\"video game\\" generation where action and effects are the raison d'etre? But that teenage girl ghost, \\"living\\" in the school girl's room, who disappears into the commode has me totally baffled. I don't recall anything like that in the Hardy Boys books I read when I was nine or in the Nancy Drew books I didn't read. (No sexism intended).<br /><br />I surmise Harry is conceived as a somewhat genderless hero - don't recall any scenes where he makes a fist or snarls at his adversaries. He waves his wand and the bad guys go flying in all directions. Never raises his voice above a whisper. I wasn't expecting the Dead End Kids Meet The Troll People but this kid just might benefit from a summer job in a Lumber yard.
B001G8XON0|5.0|Among my favorite film musicals, shines on Blu-Ray. Yes it's frantic but wonderful. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are outstanding, as is the supporting cast. The last sequence with the Bali-wood like number is amazing.  FYI: One of my other favorites is the Blu-Ray of \\"South Pacific\\".
0385339607|5.0|Rudy Baylor makes it out of law school and away from his girlfriend with pennies to spare.  He soon finds himself representing clients beyond his experience.  His landlady, Miss Birdie, needs help drafting a will to distribute her well-hidden fortune.  A bruised and beautiful hospital patient needs help turning her husband into an ex-husband.  And Donny Ray Black's parents watch him die of leukemia while the Great Benefit Insurance Company callously denies their claims for coverage of treatments that would save his life.  They need a knight with a shining law degree.<br /><br />Rudy charges into battle for all of his clients.  Hair uncombed, tie askew, and stray papers fluttering from his briefcase, Rudy is the very opposite of Leo Drummond, the immaculate lead counsel on Great Benefit's defense team.  It's not hard to predict how such a David-and-Goliath contest will turn out in a Grisham novel.  But there are a few surprises in how it happens.<br /><br />Grisham doesn't make Rudy face the enemy by himself.  His chief ally is Deck Shifflet, a self-styled \\"paralawyer\\" who knows the case-winning maneuvers that Rudy would never dream of trying on his own.  Their former boss, criminal lawyer Bruiser Stone, phones in his own advice from an undisclosed location.  And Rudy's clients help him, and each other.  The several subplots find each other as the story builds to its conclusion.<br /><br />Don't expect objectivity from this reviewer--this is far-and-away my favorite Grisham book.  There are easy-to-like and easy-to-hate characters in threatening and interesting circumstances.  There is a believable blend of suspense, comedy, and tragedy.  Surprisingly, much of this translates well to [[ASIN:B000P5FH3K the movie version]], too.  But read the book before seeing the movie.  If you don't enjoy it, you are just \\"...stupid, stupid, stupid.\\"  (Sorry; I just couldn't resist.  :^))
B004DC2WF2|5.0|This is a review after watching the first 4 episodes. Oh my God! This TV show has injected new life to a genre that was being abused. The acting, the feel of the locations, the dialogues, the make up everything is of the highest quality. It stays faithful to the main principle of the zombie genre: Are the living worse than the dead?. This group of characters show that even at the end of the world as we know it, humans cannot stick together and forget conflicts. Zombies, at least are consistent, kill and eat!...that's all. You fear the living more than the dead, the real tension comes from the characters interactions and issues. Of course, the zombie killing scenes are top notch, gory and the exact amount of brains splattered on the screen. But you won't see great athletic feats or technology, just a bunch of very regular people trying to stay alive. Episode 4 is so far my favorite.<br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br />The final scene is one of the scariest (and saddest) I've ever seen. Where the heck is Merle??? I am going to bet that he was the one that caused the carnage at the end of episode four. And he did it on purpose!!.

0061537969|3.0|The best friend I have ever had was a dog.  I still mess her.  Enzo is such a dog.  I like the way the author told the story through Enzo and gave him a strong, caring personality.  The story through Enzo is simple, entertaining and easy to read.  Anyone who has ever had a friendship with a dog will be moved by Enzo.       While Enzo is the strenth of the book, the plot, on the other hand, lets him down.  It is forced and predictable.  Several times I thought about putting the book down, but Enzo kept drawing me back.       If you have ever loved your dog you will love Enzo and the book will be worth the read.  If not, find another book.
B002XMGGJM|3.0|This is the kind of movie where you route for the success of the man doing all the killing.  Clyde's wife is raped, and she and his daughter are murdered by two men right in front of him in a home invasion robbery and murder.<br /><br />Nick, the prosecutor (Jamie Foxx), plea-bargains with one of the men to sell out the other in this crime.  The end result is that the man who raped and killed Clyde's wife gets a reduced sentence and is pretty much set free, while the other guy (who didn't do any killing, just robbery) is actually sent to death row.<br /><br />So, what makes you mad about this movie is how our judicial system works.  Nick, the prosecutor is more concerned about winning his case, than he is about actually seeking justice for the man whose family was murdered.<br /><br />So Clyde (Gerard Butler), a rightfully angry man of whom justice just disregarded him, calculates a well orchestrated plan to deliver his own brand of justice and actually go after all the participants of the prosecuting case that wronged him, including Clyde's wife's rapist.  Although, Clyde's main enemy in this revenge is Nick the Prosecutor.<br /><br />So, Clyde studies how law works and learns all the things that it takes for him to maintain his rights in a way that the prosecutor and judge cannot touch him.  And people are dying all around Nick the Prosecutor, where we believe that Nick's death will be last so that he can see Clyde takes his revenge on everyone else first.<br /><br />This movie was great to watch, until you get to the end where the judicial system once again wins to the disappointment of the viewing audience.  When Clyde was about to deliver that final blow to the whole courthouse and the rest of the city's judicial members that represent law and order, it is thwarted by Nick and his assistant.  Clyde dies sitting on his own bomb.  This was so disappointing.  So, the man who had to watch his own family die, is killed by the prosecutor who set his family's murderer free.<br /><br />If I were allowed to write the ending of this movie, I would have had Clyde successfully kill Nick's wife and daughter, and then let Nick the Prosecutor, live with the very kind of outcome that he creates as justice for other victims.  Unfortunately, this movie ended with just what might have been a realistic ending:<br /><br />No justice.  None from the beginning, and none at the end.<br /><br />Although, I don't endorse murder of any kind, I do believe Clyde should have had the right to kill his family's killer. If Nick the Prosecutor had to do anything it took to win his case, he should have at least allowed Clyde the liberty of killing his family's murderer himself.  If Nick the Prosecutor was a fair and decent man, he would have given Clyde all the information needed for Clyde to hunt him down and take his revenge on only him. No one else would have to get hurt. This would be deemed fair by the American majority.  This would be closer to justice.  Don't you think?<br /><br />If Clyde killed Nick's family and let Nick the Prosecutor live on without his family, that would make this a more justified and enjoyable film.  I would definitely want to own it then.<br /><br />I hated the ending here. I was just so disgusted!free.<br /><br />If I were allowed to write the ending of this movie, I would have had Clyde successfully kill Nick's wife and daughter, and then let Nick the Prosecutor, live with the very kind of outcome that he creates as justice for other victims.

0060254920|5.0|I recently bought this book for my son who is due in March. I loved this book as a child and I know he will too. I definately recommend this book to anyone, young or old.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This is definitely my favorite move so far in the series. Lots of action, drama, and a bit of humor. Part 2 will most likely surpass this one, tho.
B00005TQKQ|4.0|it worked so far so it seems, so I am happy. Of course It's hard sometimes to see the diff but it appears that the Hi 8 tape is brighter and clearer.
