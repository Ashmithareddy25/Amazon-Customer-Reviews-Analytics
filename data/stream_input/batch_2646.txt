B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I enjoyed this new album from Alice In Chains so much more than their last post-Layne release &#34;Black Gives Way to Blue.&#34;  I think the previous album help set the tone with their new singer, but this new album was a great fit for him and Jerry to mesh well - they sound great together.<br /><br />I would put this album ahead of their last record, along with Jerry Cantrell's solo records, but not greater than their albums from the nineties - &#34;Dirt&#34; and &#34;Facelift&#34; are definitely unreachable!<br /><br />This is a great addition to any Alice In Chain's fan collection, but for anyone really interested in knowing what makes Alice In Chains so great, I would recommend picking up their first couple of albums.

B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I bought this set because the price was reasonable and I like Indiana Jones' Adventures. I have not have a chance to watch the disc yet so I don't know the quality of the disc.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I have always loved Paramore, and this is just another album rich with awesomeness. It's a little different than their usual style, but I'm changing just as they are. Love.

1250012570|5.0|My daughter (14) was reading this book while on a road trip and told me \\"Mom I think you'd like this book\\". I rolled my eyes because the last book she recommended wasn't really my cup of tea; but when her face fell I promised her to give it a try, and so I did. I started reading the book after dinner and went to sleep at 4:50 am because I HAD to finished it. It's that enthralling, maybe because I grew up listening to that music, wearing those clothes and could reminisce about my first love; but more likely because the characters are so real that they jump out of the pages and squeeze your heart. Mrs. Rowell's writing is refreshing and thoughtful.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Die hard was a fantastic movie, Die Hard 2 a bit less so, Die Hard with a Vengence brought the series back to greatness, Live Free or Die Hard was a fun adventure... but this... this is crap.
B00008BRB5|5.0|I was pleased to find it still available.I wore it out when I owned it on cassette.The album is a must for real Police fans
0143113100|4.0|Doidge breaks down the concepts of neuroplasticity in laymen's terms and uses interesting cases to bring different topics into play. I found this book to be interesting and a pretty easy read.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|THERE WAS A MEANINGFUL BLEND OF  FAILURE OF A SYSTEM AND THE DESTRUCTIVE RESULTS ON THE LIFE OF THE PROTAGONIST AND THE SAVING GRACES OF LOVE AND NATURE IN THIS STORY. CLEAVING TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS INTRODUCED BY THE ONE GOOD FOSTER MOTHER ,WHO WAS WRONGLY DISMISSED, OUR YOUNG CHILD PROGRESSED TO ADULTHOOD OVERCOMING ALL HER INTERNALIZED SELF DESTRUCTIVE TENDENCIES. A VERY GOOD READ.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|this was a fantastic book and has a lot of everything including a lot of combat and more! I would definitely recommend this book!<br />If i were you I would red the series before this which starts with the lightning thief. after that read the lost hero then th son of neptune. I hope you enjoy as I have!
B008602KQI|4.0|Book is very readable, keeps your attention throughout. Enjoyable - a feel good story. Slightly juvenile in plot and delivery - but still worth the read to anyone, any age, any background.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it the best horse game ever. People should totally get this game. I can never resist it I already have 3 horses.
B001EBWING|5.0|I have watched this movie many times and enjoy it every time I do.  Great love story and think Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid<br />Bergman did justice to the characters.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Kudos to Dustin Hoffman and the fine cast of this beautiful film. It is a movie that brings us into touch with the fickle<br />nature of all human relationships. When we know that we have gone to the top of the ladder in our chosen field, we<br />are reluctant to relinquish that position to anyone, especially another person within our age range who has been a<br />competitor. It is a superb cast; many of those men and women actually lived that role in their daily life. Personally, I<br />wanted to be able to walk through space and time, and be a character in that movie. It must have been great fun to<br />participate as a cast member. I highly recommend this movie to any person who has an interest in good music;  not<br />just opera, or classical music in general. Perhaps this very entertaining movie may open up your minds to a genre<br />of music that can lift your soul. This movie is a sampler of aurally appealing music, with excellent actresses and actors<br />to convey it to the public.
0525478817|5.0|I'd like to say that this book is everything amazing that everyone else mentioned AND also very entertaining with sweet and witty humor throughout most of the book.  It was very easy for me to get hooked right away.  I think guys would enjoy this book too!  Not just for girls.  :)  And I suppose I have a thing for star-crossed lovers and boys with one leg.  ;)  p.s.  Don't read any spoilers!
B009AOFNU4|5.0|Bought this to work on my Galaxy Tab 8.  Works great, easy to pair, works great on both of my game emulators I already had (that are not on the site listed as compatible apps)  Also works great on other apps I already have, Beach Buggy Blitz, Rip Tide, Shine runner, Temple run...<br /><br />Didn't think it would work, but works great on my Blackberry z10 phone as well.  Limited apps that it works with but there are a couple of them.  Also side loaded the Android apk's from the emulators onto the z10 and again works great.<br /><br />The only thing I want now is a tablet case that stands my tab up and has a built in place to hold this controller :)  I'm asking too much I know!
B00005JMAH|4.0|I enjoyed this mover of Harry Potter especially with the surprise twist at the end of the movie.<br />I do like to watch Harry Potter over and over.
0307593525|5.0|excellent condition and made a great birthday gift,  They loved it and should<br />get lots of tasty use from it.
0553801473|5.0|Not much to say here. If you already started reading the other books then there is no need for me to try to convince you to read this one. You'll have already bought it on your own by now.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|Very good movie.  I don't purchase many unless I know I will it again.  This movie fit that bill.  Great movie.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|I unfortunately do not have a smart tv right now, nor do I have cable to one of the tv's in my house. This has made watching Netflix and HBO possible because I can stream it through my phone. Love it!
B001AQIYJC|5.0|Nicholas Cage (Seth), Meg Ryan (Dr. Maggie Rice), & Andre Braugher (Cassiel)  give a this movie the delicate balance of romance, fantasy, situations involving the physician & &#34;a city of angels&#34;, and so much more.<br /><br />And I found it on Amazon!! Love you, Amazon.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|&#34;Oz The Great and Powerful&#34; manages to be a homage to the 1939 classic Oz movie while remaining individual and modern.  It was funny and touching, there were life lessons buried in the plot, and the special effects were perfect.  Even as a 3D movie (how I saw it in the theater) it was very impressive.  If there are problems with the film, it may be that James Franco plays a bad actor, so he is often acting obviously bad on purpose.  Plus the glorious Mila Kunis winds up hidden behind makeup for the second half of the film.  But I find both to be appropriate to the story, and the film overall to be a worthy and intelligent addition to the Oz canon.
B00B78AIV0|5.0|I found this first novel by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie to be a superbly crafted story about post-colonial Africa.  Having lived for several years in East Africa, I was delighted to be able to envision the settings, characters, actions and vernacular language.  It is essentially a tale about the current transformation of African republics, struggling to create a world that befits their cultural mindsets and dreams.  In most cases, these political and social processes are often painful, if not necessary to move from the ancient ways into modern times, as this story depicts today's Nigeria.<br /><br />In this cautionary tale, the narrator is a young teenage girl. She and her older brother have been constantly bullied and manipulated to become their father's best examples of his Catholic faith, wealth, politics and place in modern Nigeria.  After a time, family circumstances offer a way out of their oppressive situation.  The siblings' lives become intolerable but this is only realized when they are finally exposed to &#34;normal&#34;, African family life, in the home of their father's loving and generous sister.  Through the experiences of living as most other Nigerians do, the daughter and her brother begin to find a new path in life that is without the constraints of her father's strict and abusive manner of child rearing.  In the end, everything falls apart, when the mother decides to end the cycle of abuse and neglect in her family.  However, due to dire necessity, the daughter find herself responsible for running the broken family.  Through sheer will and hope, she succeeds in keeping her immediate family intact but not &#34;whole&#34;.<br /><br />Probably what is best about this story is Ms. Chimamanda's highly-skilled manner of describing the thoughts and actions of her main characters.  The settings are as lushly told as the people within the places of the storyline.  Her use of highly effective language and the characters' varied vernacular is superb.  The conflicts within the plot are real for the book's African family, as the actions would be for other families, worldwide.  Mostly it's about how people come together to share themselves, to help one another and to redeem themselves, in the face of crisis and hope.  Eventually the several in the family become part of the Nigerian world  diaspora, as political and social events begin to unravel the worlds of the characters' extended family.<br /><br />The theme echos that of Chinua Achebe's trilogy, beginning with the classic tale: THINGS FALL APART.  A bit of research into modern Nigerian history and politics would also help the reader better understand the motivations and lives of this story. If you enjoy this novel about Africa, you should also download or buy works by Zakes M'da; Nadine Gordimer; Ben Okri; M. J. Vassanji; Abdulrazak Gurnah, to name a few, because they are all important African writers who have created an important body of literature about their continent.
0671449028|5.0|Love this book and my LO do too. She really like to hear the rhymes and loves to hear it at night.
B003XRELEI|5.0|It is a book about america and its culture.  It’s about war, freedom, racism, capitalism and importance of appearances.  All of it disguised in a science-fiction tale told with his unique style.
0689835604|5.0|My LO likes the flip open parts and likes the pictures in this book. Really worth the buy they will love it.
B00BVYU2P2|4.0|Entertaining but make sure the little ones are not around.  lots of sex talk and some body on body.  I dont remember high school<br />this packed with sex, where was I?
B008G12ERC|5.0|A great new album from MUSE. Showing once again that even though their style grows and is flexible from album to album, they still hold to the pumping bass lines, great &#34;stories&#34; and powerful anthems. I love the theme of 2nd Law and almost all of the songs tie in very well with each other. A solid performance and an even better live performance if you get the chance to see the tour.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I have just started reading David Baldacci and is fast becoming one of my favorite authors.  I'm reading his book in reverse.  He keep the reader just guessing enough that you want to go back for more.  The Innocent with the connection to a young teen who has been through so much working along side this rough and tough guy is a nice switch.  Shows that underneath it all this guy does have a soft side even though he keeps it in check.  This is a great book and it does keep the reader intriqued.  Try it you'll like it!
B0082XKGGU|5.0|I bought both electric and paper of this for it is so insiteful.  Read first four books quick and feel it like Socrates can be great life lessons.  New info on a great old subject.  Ideas from a king and can be put into present day to focus self.  A must get for life searchers.  Read some SPencer Johnson as well or Atilla.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. It as a great way to really exercise your brain in an interesting way.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love puzzles and these are just challenging enough to be fun without frustration.Each puzzle room is just a little more difficult as you progress.
B006JPS1OM|2.0|To why this game is not yet fixed! Looks like I am not the only one with problems. I have bought this game twice and have only been refunded once. I was told I wasn't charged twice but I was. I was told to uninstall it then reinstall it which meant I had to buy it again. I can't get past chapter two cause it crashes then takes me to the purchase menu. I HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT THIS GAME TWICE!!!!!! This is really annoying to me and would think it would be resolved by now SMH.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|times when you have to wait and need something to do, this<br />is a great game to play on your phone. I LOVE IT.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Such a well written book.  Different than most books best way to describe it is a found footage movie.  I highly recommended this to everyone I know.  2nd time reading it and still love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|hi this game is really awesome and cool I cant believe I did not by it earlyer and soooooo cool people
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This book was simply amazing. Towards the end, when the plot line seemed a tiny bit predictable, he managed to kEep it entertaining with a wonderful twist. As always with his books, expect tears.
B009X01FJS|5.0|I had had a Kindle Fire, but upgraded to an HD and was looking for a more feminine cover. Only thing missing is a stylus holder like the one I had on my old cover.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I own horses my self and I think the developers of this app did a great job with the graphics in this game. Keep up the good work!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I think it is, the best of Hosseini's novels so far because I could put myself into some of the characters. It revolves around good people trying to solve immediate needs, but unaware of the future consequences that haunt them the rest of their lives. It reminded me a bit of a Thomas Hardy novel. The resolve comes a bit too late for the characters to get  satisfaction. And for myself, the failure of Pari to recognize the box of feathers that had been saved and given to her after the death of her brother, denied me a consequence I had hoped for. But the author's genius made the unrecognition more realistic and a better book.
086571701X|4.0|I did not buy it from here, but it is a very good book. If you are interested in this agriculture practice that's on the rise, this here is a good book. She goes through the idea all the way through to execution.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|We started to play this as a family and enjoy the challenge. My husband and three boys aged seven nine and thirteen enjoy it.  It is easy enough to move along  nicely
B005CVWWJY|4.0|Provided you love the '80's, referencing to the era was great fun. Storyline intriguing. Gorgeous love story amid the future setting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's fun. Good add ons that keep it fun. Gets very fast. Replay value is great!<br /> I'm all about replay value. Great to play over and over
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Enjoyed this read. Easy to read. Gladly different to the blurb I read. Gave an idea of strength I didn't expect.
B0086900TI|5.0|What a sleeper!  This film is a must for anyone concerned about the public school system and about the anger that is just beneath the surface (sometimes on top of the surface) in our society today.  All the issues that confront public education today and capsulized in this remarkable and honest film.
B00A8OBSX6|5.0|I eagerly awaited this disc. Ever since I first heard Mr. Cencic in the splendid recording of Handel's \\"Faramondo\\" (also on the Virgin Label), I have been collecting his work. This artist seems to me the closest we can get to some of the famous castrati of the past. The passion he is able to infuse into his singing is really exceptional, since that is not a quality usually associated with countertenors. I love countertenor voices and have collected them for many years; but this is very special (Like Philippe Jaroussky is special-but one cannot really compare these voices; one being a true soprano and the other a mezzo-soprano). My favorite aria on this disc is \\"Sposa, non mi conosci\\" from Giacomelli's opera \\"Merope\\", a work totally unknown to me. This recording seems to me to be well nigh perfect. Mr. Cencic puts his all into this performance and I cannot imagine this being equaled, let alone surpassed. The orchestra and conductor seem to have great fun in discovering and playing all the music on this disc. Most of the arias are totally unknown today and this disc is therefor  a great journey through the past glories of Venice. Thoroughly and enthusiastically recommended!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Typical Blu-Ray. I haven't gotten to the extras yet, so I'm not rating that. I like the DTS option - better sound if you have a processor that deals with it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|wish there were more levels/floors!  fun, challenging, and hard to put down.  this is in my top three favorite apps.  looking forward to more.
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|I like this game a lot more than I thought I would, however it is a little buggy. I have opened a hundred chests with the key but still can't get that challenge. Still fun though.
0671449028|1.0|i was not expecting a cardboard childs book.  it certainly not worth anything to me.  it is actually useless and I will not be getting more product from you again for quite some time.  this was not represented correctly on line.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|It's a simple contraption that gets the job done-  I'm happy with the results!  I suggest a couple practice runs to get the hang of it but otherwise the product was satisfactory.
B0055XCDZ2|5.0|I didn't start watching this until into season three being able to purchase and watch all of the episodes for all previous seasons has been great! I'm up to speed on all the goings on. Also interesting to note how some seemingly small things in prior episodes come back into play later. Will probably watch everything a second time to look for other relevant things.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I stumbled upon this series and enjoyed the dialogue between heat and rook. I also enjoyed  roach the other detectives. I plan to read the rest of them
B000WOXVJQ|5.0|From Live! to unspoken recordings, this album brings with it an array of great Marley tunes.  Includes the hits as well as those songs which were recorded at a young age to complete the Marley library of tunes.  Several songs were included in the film 'Marley' that many had not heard of, but could be found on this album.  Clear, quality recordings that we can all come to love.
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|I can pretty much see how this went down. John Carpenter's \\"The Thing\\" was a huge hit so someone(s) looked at it to see if there was another story in there to exploit. The best bet was to take the story with the Norwegians before Carpenter's story begins. I'm in.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. The Norwegians find the space ship stuck in the ice near their base in Antarctica and want to do a study. They enlist a young female biologist to help. The creature thaws out, starts to assimilate people and now it's a game of paranoid survival.<br /><br />This is nearly a carbon copy of Carpenter's piece. It starts with us meeting the crew, them coming into possession of the thing. The thing, of course, escapes and they need to try and figure out who is and who ain't assimilated, along with a way out of the mess. There is a clever turn here on how the assimilated can be detected, but it's mostly what you've already seen. They do a good job in ramping up the paranoia and the turn the goo dial up to 11. The effects are good and the action is smooth.<br /><br />This appears to be a Norwegian production but, as they targeted it for the U.S., they knew they needed some Americans (well....two Americans and an Aussie) to head things up. This is all very clean and slick but it's better craft than art and, given its pedigree, it's not as involving as I would have liked. I do like it and will see it some number of times more. It just is too much more of the same.
B008602KQI|5.0|Very exciting and terrific acting, will watch again and recommend to my friends to watch. hope there is another one coming
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great thinking game. good graphic on my fire. I like it when the clues are in multiple rooms. try it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Liked how real it felt-like being at the arcade. Even the sound of the  coins hitting the surface made it seem real. Didn't like the extra part of the game (collecting puzzle pieces for the merry go round?) didn't know what the object of that was. Overall a good game that kept me busy and it was free.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have played most of the bingo games on my kindle and this one is the best.  Highly addictive. Working for achievement makes bingo blitz more interesting than the others.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Even though the first levels are easy it still is so much fun! I don't get bored as with other games.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I really enjoyed the slow build up of action and intrigue this book offered.  I think this will be the beginning of a new series of Jack Ryan Jr. Books.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|5 stars for being everything and more that i expected it to be, boc never disappoints, i highly recommend everyone spend the 10 bucks and buy it
B00C1BHQXK|4.0|This book helps you focus on the important things, whether in business or in your personal life.  I have always lacked focus, which has made ti difficult to get things done.  This book teaches you to focus on the one thing that you can do right now, that will help you get the results you want.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A good read. Once you start reading it, it's hard to put down. Not your typical romance novel. Good storyline. I hope they pick Henry Cavill to be Fifty.
B00CKJ2KK2|3.0|Fun but so many issues on kindle fire. Aim freaks out; Game kicks you out; More money spent than earned (repairs); Tons of lag; After death it has an option to purchase enemies weapon conveniently where shoot button is practically tricking you to waste your hard earned diamonds.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It doesn't leave me aching to read the third book. However, I'm going to finish the final book only because I've made it thus far. I hope it doesn't disappoint. Fingers are crossed.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|So looking forward to another hot Crossfire series:) I don't want the story to end. Fifty Shades better step it up a notch or two!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I play this constantly. when I have free time. I don't like the ads but noticed they stop after 10 or 15 games. when is clock solitaire coming?
B0034G4P7G|3.0|I thought it was a good movie,  i wish i could of gave it a 3.5 but i cant on this rating system.. This is all my opinion but the one thing i DIDN'T like about the movie is how it kept flashing back to the deposition scene with lawyers, etc.. I felt that slowed the movie down a lot.. Acting is pretty superb by Jessie Einsberg, Justin Timberlake, etc... Movie is kind of depressing but it isn't suppose to be a \\"feel good\\" movie.  The movie picks up a lot during the second/third act.
B00821PCJS|5.0|This is a very good show!! I had no Ideal that it started two years ago. I just happen to catch a preview and I thought it might be good. It was great!
B00003CWOL|3.0|We managed to see this movie a few years ago on an old DVD player that we happened to own. The player passed its prime, and we moved on. As I'm sure many of us have done, we realized that our laptops could work overtime as media viewers. We saw this movie the first time as a rental, but we liked it so much that we bought a copy, but it won't play on anything we own. DRM taken to the extreme? We couldn't believe it, so we bought a second copy: same problem. We tried again, renting it from Netflix: nope. Sure enough, the producers of this awesome movie have decided that humanity is evil and we're all thieves, and they've made it impossible to watch their movie on computers and modern players. I just can't find a way to say how disappointing this is without using profanity! We saw it once, and would rate this as one of our favorite movies, but we can't ever see it again!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is really good, I'm in room 4 and so far it is easy plus it is free so if you don't like it you can simply delete it
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|the ultimate collection. compared to other trilogies or box set, this is slim n neat. more extras on the classic 'raiders'.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|As a registered nurse, you would have thought I would have enjoyed the film. I found it more like a documentary and was searching for the words 'based on a true story' which I never found. I would never have labeled it as a suspense unless one scene counts? The film was slow, boring, and was frankly yawning through the whole thing. If you have insomnia and need something that causes a sleepy effect -- this film should do it for you!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Love this movie! Fun storyline and great music! Amazing what sounds can be made without instruments.  If you are looking to watch something upbeat, it is definitely this movie.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|It took about a half hour for this movie to start going anywhere but once it did it was action packed !
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I'm so disappointed they cancelled this show. The first season was something new and exciting full of stars. A new show about the happenings of Broadway.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of Nicholas Sparks best works!  Written about a abusive relationship, and at times I had to put the story down because it was quite disturbing.
1558908846|5.0|Great movie in great condition everything I expected and enjoyed the movie can't stop seeing it every once in a while
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Much better than Casino Royale. Sad ending though. It brought a bit of the old back in this film which is great.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|i bought the first one and then the second one it is so cute of the penquins and the voices they lend to the charater
B00C061I3K|5.0|Listen end to end, and hopefully the doubters will enjoy the construction of the album.  This album wasn't meant to be picked through.  I listen from beginning to end on my commute to school, and it really is their best since their Discovery LP.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|i use my xbox to watch my movies and it is great great delvery of the movie and i usally watch the movie on family night
B002BI4JLU|1.0|I was trying to buy a really great movie called the big blue about free diving. This is not it. It's a doc. on whales or something. bummer.
B004EPZ034|5.0|i seen all of alvin chipmonks movies they are so cute now that they have the chipettes  and the seasonal ones they bring out too
0316223239|1.0|This book was a waste of my money to be honest. The blurb at the back of the book described it to be some emotionally triggering suspense-filled story but it's not. The author goes into no real detail about what \\"old Nick\\" does to Jack's mother in the night and this lack left me feeling apathetic as if there was no real trauma involved in her story. They escape in the middle of the novel and it's literally peaches and flowers for the next 200 pages of the book. BORING. I was hoping for some kind of twist at the end to really grab the reader's attention, but nothing. The reader is just left with 200 pages of reading at a 5 year-old's perspective as he learns how to say please and thank you and still wanting to drink from his mom's boobs. I'm mad I read this. Anyone that says it was an incredible read is lying.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love the game............ and I am the first to comment! Woo hoo! It is fun to do so I say get the app
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The visual as well as sound quality are great. There is a lot of bonus material on the separate disk. Most of it covers Raiders, but I thought it was fine.
B007Z5WMCW|3.0|it could be better if it had the Disney Chanle. and if it would let u choose the shows.:( sad.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|clever game! just like the other versions, there are levels that I get without hardly thinking about it, and others that I just can't seem to solve, no matter what I try. I really like that there are jewels to collect, and hidden levels. I've just gotten to the Roses - what a neat concept! I play this on a kindle fire, and have not experienced any trouble so far
B000FBFMIO|5.0|I loved the book and look forward to reading the next book in the series.  Robin Hobb is an amazing author.

B00AF6MF9I|4.0|As of today, I am having the same problem as others with the update. I get stuck at 3% during the loading and the update just redirects me to here. Based on other comments I'm not putting much faith in the game developers to fix anything so anyone with any suggestions would be as appreciated. Between this g as me and kingdom and lords I have had to start over 4 times because of issues like this. Really not willing to do it again. other than that,this is by far and away my favorite game. It's the only one I play.

B00C7JGDBW|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />The story of of Dorothy and friends traversing through the land of Oz is one that has stood the test of time. Whether you are young or old, a movie enthusiasts or not, The Wizard of Oz is a tale that you are likely to have seen. But what happened before Dorothy landed in this strange world and set out to take down the evil Wicked With of the West? Was she always so wicked? And what about Oz? Where did he come from? These are all the questions that Oz the Great and Powerful attempts to answer and it does so pretty successfully. Through vibrant colors and a new group of likable characters, Oz the Great and Powerful reopens this world that captured the hearts of many in hopes of providing some backstory while at the same time appealing to people of all ages.<br /><br />After the disastrous attempt at recreating the world of Wonderland back in 2010, I found that I was very skeptical going into Oz the Great and Powerful. To say that I was pleasantly surprised with the end result would be a bit of an understatement. Once the film starts the viewer is greeted with a tiny box in the middle of the screen sporting some beautiful black and white visuals. This throwback lasts for about 20 minutes as we meet Oscar \\"Oz\\" Diggs (James Franco) and learn a bit of his backstory and who he is as a person. This black and white segment ends with Oz getting sucked up into a twister (I smiled) and finding himself in the land of Oz. Upon meeting Theodora (Mila Kunis), Oz is sent to take down Glinda (Michelle Williams); who he's told is the wicked witch.<br /><br />Oz quickly finds out the truth about Glinda as she tells him who she is and what her place is in the land of Oz. Along with Finley (Zach Braff) and China Girl (Joey King), Oz sets out to find the truth about this mystical land and attempts to help these people through lies and deceit - they believe him to be \\"the great wizard\\". The story progresses and we see how the Wicked Witch of the West came about and we also get to see the third sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz), the Wicked Witch of the East. Filled with heartfelt moments and a handful of references to the 1939 film, there's a lot to love about this origin story. However, the end result is far from perfect.<br /><br />My biggest problem with Oz the Great and Powerful is that everything seems a little premature. The story, the visuals, the script; none of it feels completely polished. While the film is filled with beautiful environments and bright colors, nothing seems real. Now I know that sounds weird when addressing a film about a mystical land full of witches and munchkins, but it's true. From the moment Oz found himself in this world I suddenly felt disconnected. No longer did I feel as engaged as I was moments earlier because the entire thing is one obvious green screen. There was clearly a lot of time and effort put into making this world come alive; I just wish the same effort could have been put into making it feel like something I could physically inhabit.<br /><br />While both the story and script have their fair share of surprises, they too could have used a little more time to develop into something truly spectacular. At times I found that the characters became predictable, as did the dialogue and some of the scenarios we found ourselves in. You have the selfish Oz who gains a heart by the end of the film, the obviously evil Evanora who turns out to be the real antagonist, and many other obvious character outcomes. The dialogue, while strong for majority of the film, gets pretty corny in some areas. Most of it comes from either Theodora or Oz himself, but none of the characters are exempt from saying something stupid at one point or another.<br /><br />With that said, Oz works so well because it has charm. You meet Finley and China Girl - I found it weird that she wasn't given an actual name - pretty early in the adventure and they were honestly my two favorite characters. Finley was probably there more for comedic effect for the younger viewers, but he really helped balance out the obnoxious personality of Oz. While his reasons for assisting Oz were a bit cliched, his presence was appreciated as he helped add a little heart to a situation when Oz became a bit too much for me to handle. China Girl was just an adorable character in general and hearing her little feet clacking when she walked made my heart melt. Also, the animations for both of these characters was very well done, as was the make-up for the Wicked Witch of the West.<br /><br />Performance wise the cast was kind of mixed. James Franco gave another Franco performance, but I think it was the character of Oz and his dialogue that really turned me off. Mila Kunis gave another one of her inconsistent performances that ranges from really good to just plain awful. Rachel Weisz was ok, but nothing breathtaking or extremely memorable. If anyone really delivered it would be Michelle Williams. She was the perfect Glinda and she was probably given one of the strongest roles in the film. Just an all around great performance from her.<br /><br />Overall Score: 7.5/10 - In short, Oz the Great and Powerful is solid. It's gorgeous to look at, borrows from some of the same elements found in the original, and once again we're given a nice, diverse cast of characters. However, as a whole the movie is inconsistent with itself. It never really reaches its stride because majority of the time it seems unable to find its footing. It constantly stumbles and it would have greatly benefited from some more time and polish. Still, it's a nice experience and one I would recommend to any family or fan of the original.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|I write this review for two groups of readers: those who have read the Wheel of Time series and  appreciated the work that Brandon did on that series, but have not yet read any of his other works, and those who have read his Mistborn series and enjoyed it as much as I did.<br /><br />If you are in the latter group, then my advice is simple; read this book. It is every bit as entertaining and enjoyable as the Mistborn series.<br /><br />If all you know of Brandon is from his work on the Wheel of Time series, then you may be thrown off by the shift in action and focus when reading this book. My advice to you would be to read Brandon's Mistborn series first. If you do not enjoy that three-book series, then you may not want to start this expected 10-book one. My prediction: not many of you will stop with the Mistborn series. It is that good, and so is this book.

B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great new series for anyone into dystopian, apocolyptic, or alien stories. Or even if you just like well told stories for that matter. Edge of your seat thrills with great acting, particularly from Noah Wyle, who's amazing in everything he does.

0553801473|1.0|In this book, Martin introduces several more variously important characters, has several of the characters we know turn into people we don't recognize, most notably Tyrion. He produces plot complication after plot complication.<br />Every thread ends with a cliff-hanger. It is as if Martin wants this series to outlive him, not figuratively as having its reputation live on but literally. He wants to die leaving his readers wanting more.<br />Fine with me but I'm done with it.
030759565X|2.0|I thought that since I like the blog, that this would be a great book.  It has great pictures, and I like the stories that go with each recipe.  (However, it is my pet peeve when people talk about their kids too much, which she does.)  Sadly, I've made three recipes, and didn't enjoy any of them... the dill & cucumber coleslaw, the chicken salad, and the cauliflower pasta.  All of them were bland and boring.  I thought they sounded like they had enough good ingredients, so maybe they need some tweaking, but as written, they were very disappointing.  There are plenty of other versions of these things that I've made which were much better, so I am not likely to bother with them again.  I was also disappointed to see that half of the book was taken up by dessert recipes.  That's my personal preference though.  As others have said, the layout is also annoying.

0307346609|5.0|For a fan of the Sci-Fi, Vampire, Werewolf, Zombie, General Horror genres This book is fraking awesome!!<br />Styled as a compilation of accounts from a variety of folks over periods a priori, during, and toward the end of the Zombie War.<br />Many of the details were spot-on for social and political commentary: there is an account from a hired-gun who talks about how the wealthy had a mindset that was wildly opposed to that of people with fewer resources. But for people who knew how to manage those resources...read the book.<br /><br />And the military/tactical information was great and very fact-based.<br /> Simply a great fictional accounting of very real tactical scenarios. Going to see the movie the same night I am writing this book review. Which I am sure will disappoint me because most print-to-screen adaptations usually disappoint.

B00CXL6XP0|4.0|I've been listening to Queensryche since 1989.  I have bought every album and every DVD they've ever made.  I have seen them in concert at least 10 times.  Then, after \\"Dedicated to Chaos\\" (or as I called that album 'Phoning it In') I decided to give up my hope for a post-Promised Land album that was worth listening to.  I sampled the new Geoff Tate QR album \\"Frequency Unknown\\" using a streaming service and this reinforced my resolve to give up on my once favorite band (It made \\"Dedicated to Mediocre\\" look like a work of art - it was gawd-awful.).  Last night I stumbled across a number of positive reviews for this album, and then sampled two tracks on YouTube...it was - dare I say- good!  This is the best QRyche album since Promised Land.  This is the old Iron Maiden-esque Queensryche that you remember from the '80s with a new twist (and a new vocalist who sounds just different enough from Tate to feel authentic, but no so different that the music is not recognizable as Queensryche).<br /><br />One online music review claimed that \\"this is the Queensryche album you have been waiting for for over 20 years\\" and \\"for the first time in over a decade Queensryche might be relevant again\\"...I couldn't agree more.
B00BC24NT4|2.0|I believe the primary reason this novel was written was to give the author an opportunity to brush up on his ability to write in British vernacular.  It was truly a disappointment.......

B00BY8DIT2|3.0|A good collection of different styles and genre of music, but the sound quality left something to be desired, weather playing in the house or car the sound goes up and down in the middle of songs, when the bass kicks in hard it seems to muffle, would not recommend adding this to your collection.
1451695195|2.0|As partner to a wonderful strong man whose life was saved by a neuro surgeon after he had a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage secondary to a G5 aneurysm I had a lot of expectations for this book.  My partner has experienced direct spiritual contact from loved ones since the aneurysm where he was a total sceptic prior.  I found the writing style too simplistic and not enough detail about the waking up process itself which is long and difficult needing speech pathology, OT, physio.... (although I understand that the spiritual contact was the main point of the book, even that I found to be a little unbelievable with not enough emphasis placed on the absolute love aspect), would also like to know more about how his experience affected his life in general and how he thinks it will affect his life going into the future.  I thought it was put together hastily for sale, the content was often cliche and glib, and I was left wanting much much more.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I gotta say this CD is perfect! the music is great and an awesome addition to the genre. Anyone kinda on the fence about it, just buy it. You won't regret it. I listen to this in the car and love every second of it.
1476715904|5.0|This book had me the moment I met the main character, Layken who just moved to Michigan during her senior year. The story was so intense I felt as if I was in the book and going through every moment side by side with the characters. Eddie, her new best friend; Kel, her nine-year-old little brother; Julia, her mother; and Will, the love of her life.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover has a true talent of making you sad, happy, and angry along with Layken as she tackles the difficulties in her life. When she moves she finds out handsome young twenty-one year old Will lives next to her.  They are immediately drawn to each other only to be driven apart by things almost unthinkable. If that weren't enough Layken's world just about comes to a stop with family thing that nearly crumbles her life into dust.<br /><br />Every turn of a page was like a slap of emotions. Each chapter had me crying, laughing, and scowling with each word. I couldn't even try to put the book down, not with what's going on in Layken's life.<br /><br />I have to say Eddie and Kel were DEFINITELY my favorites in the book. With Kel's humor and Eddie's excitement humor definitely gave the book much more... flavor.  And also brought light to the sadder parts.<br /><br />My favorite part was the whole book. I sort of never wanted the story to end. This is, without a doubt, my favorite book, EVER!

B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I've read all of his previous adult books and, after reading this one, I think he spent too much time writing for children.  This book has nowhere near the depth and complexity of his previous work.  I read it on my Kindle, and, at one point, I was thinking that the setup looked like it was coming to a close and I checked to see how far along I was.  Around 85%.  This story would have made a nice first couple of chapters for a real book
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's fun keeps me entertained while bored  at work  and home I don't like the having the game telling me to buy cheap cause I'm definitely not
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Most everyone reading this will be familiar with the movies already.  Personally I think the first three are great, and the fourth mediocre.  I do not hate Crystal Skull like others.  Certainly do not hate it enough to be insulted that it is included in this set like some others are.  Yes, I think parts of it were stupid.  Not even the alien part because lets face it all the movies have an element of supernatural to them (melting faces, instant mummification etc) but the things that bothered me were surviving a nuclear blast in a lead lined fridge, surviving said fridge being thrown for miles, swinging through the jungle to cover miles in a couple minutes and so on.  At least in the first three films the non-supernatural aspects were plausible, none of the \\"real life\\" things in crystal skull came off as even remotely believable.  There were some comedic moments and references to the old films though that if you do watch it are worth a chuckle.  I agree that it did not need to be made, and had all the hallmarks of Lucas trying to be too clever with the story, but they made 4 movies, and of course it was going to be included in this set.<br /><br />The audio and video quality of the restorations of the other movies are very good.  Given when they were filmed (especially Raiders and Temple of Doom), there is only so much that could be done to get the video quality up for the blu ray transfer.  There are still some blurry and grainy portions of the older films, but I think they have looked the best they ever have on video or DVD.  Of course crystal skull has the best AV quality, but also has the most amount of special effects and green screen sequences.<br /><br />The bonus disc is full of great behind the scenes and bonus material.  There is a new on set with Raiders of The Lost Ark feature, then the same features that were included in the DVD set put out years ago with the original three movies.  Personally I think it was worth it to upgrade from that version to the Blu Rays.  If you absolutely hate the fourth movie and want nothing to do with it, and are fine with having the original three, then you probably want to either wait until the discs are available in blu ray, or just stick with the original DVD set.

1926667131|4.0|good stuff,  just very (physically) hard to read.  The print type too is extra bold, and the never thought i'd say this as it sounds nitpicky,  the margins are next to nill on every page so it's very odd to get through each paragraph.
B0062QRTKA|3.0|It's a really fun concept, and a really challenging game.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and without any glitches it's worthy of 5 stars...<br />however, twice the game has locked and required unloading and reloading to my Kindle which means restarting from the beginning.  This happened on two occasions on two different play screens.  Unfortunately there is no exit option during play (no way to abort the game) and the game restarts at the moment of last play - a nice enough feature until it locks and can't be restarted.  I finally removed it from my device because it's not worth starting over so many times.

B003Y2BMVC|5.0|I really enjoy the twist on the this style of story.  The look of the movie and the sound track are great. Adults and kids will enjoy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I, personally, enjoyed this game very much. When I had cotton this app, (for free!) I had been sick.  Searching around the wide variety of apps, I came across Subway Suffers as one of the top hits in the store. Remembering that many of my friends had enjoyed this game, I downloaded it. I happily played the game for the days that I was sick. This not only kept me entertained, but as I got better, I played it at a healthy rate, also. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and recommend it for everyone at any age!
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I have had a blast with Sudoku 4ever Plus! Lots of features and difficulty levels make this a great game for all experience levels.
B00ANDDBBE|3.0|I love this show, if only for it, I would give it 10 stars. But, as this is a product review, I gave it only 3 because of some problems with its package. There were some glue residues that gave me troubles when I tried to take it out of the outer box, and four out of the six discs it has won't run on my dvd player for some reason; I had to watch them on my laptop. Other than that, everything was good. I really licked the booklet that comes with this fourth series, really nice looking. My only complaint about the dvd content is that I was expecting it to have some outtakes, but none of them were present.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|I'm particularly interested in China during the early 20th century and this book really hit home.  It demonstrates how the foreign concessions operated as their own independent islands of life; British, Chinese and Japanese politics of the times and the lack of interest in pursuing a murderer; Japan's slow moving occupation of China; and the Chinese underbelly that had great power and money.  Some recognizable names like Edgar Snow gave me pause because they were presented in a whole different light.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Not exactly like the book, but I guess its close enough to the book to get the gist of it.  I'm sure when the next movies come out it will be enough to get the trilogy without reading

B00BU2SIW4|1.0|Like the title says, I really wanted to like this album. But in the end, the song writing is boring, uninspired and even just plain bad at points. What makes this album even worse is the fact that whom ever mixed the sound did a bad job as well. Most songs the vocals are drown out by the synthesizer. I actually wholeheartedly regret spending money on this album and am writing a review in the hopes that you do not make the same mistake I did.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|Phenomenal. This books just as good as the previous books. In this book you come to expect the  unexpected as George R.R. Martin is always five steps ahead of you. Even when you think you finally understand something he is always there to shown you that you were wrong. This book does answer some of the questions created in the first two books, but for every question answered there seems to be another hundred to take its place. But it's those couple answered that lead you forward, because you know just enough to be able  to keep reading but little enough to want to read more.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like the ease of use on this version. It's fun when playing on the kindle.<br />I will be using this a lot.

B000FA5SMK|4.0|This book is hard to get into at first.  It was recommended to me by a friend so I stuck with it and I'm glad I did.  I will be reading more in the series.
B00AEBBA68|5.0|Shutter Island, based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, is a psychological thriller about two Federal Marshalls who travel to the mental asylum on Shutter Island to find out what happened to a missing patient. But when the investigation turns into a disturbing game of cat-and-mouse, Marshall Teddy Daniels starts to see through the cracks and begins to uncover a conspiracy that can only end in tragedy. Leonardo DiCaprio is a phenomenal actor who keeps getting snubbed at the Oscars, especially when he deserves it, and his performance here is by far his best. Mark Ruffalo, who usually did drama/romance before this, was great as Teddy's partner, Chuck. Then, there is Ben Kingsley, who is fantastic as the mysterious warden of Shutter Island. Martin Scorsese's directing is superb, capturing every paranoia-filled moment with finesse, and dug deep into your skin whenever the tension starts to rise. The script was award-worthy, being one of the few novel-to-film movies that is just as good, if not better than the original work.<br /><br />Overall, Shutter Island is a hailed thriller that both shocks and awes audiences with its mind-bending twists and turns that truly challenge your mind. If Inception was just imagined as a thriller and not a sci-fi action movie, and more confusing, this is it.<br /><br />\\"You'll never leave this island.\\"

B00B0X4PIO|5.0|A great insight into the human tragedy  of war in our time on ordinary people.  Its amazing to realise things like that are happening in the world and we don't hear about them.  It was a brilliant story, sad and compassionate and yet very real.

I picked up the book hoping to understand the power of that addiction and I didn't want another self help book preaching the program with no real experience and I love Nikki Sixx, this helped me understand the struggles and the demons that addicts deal with and that it's a life long process.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Good thriller, would hold your attention, there is obviously a sequal on the way..<br />Thought the author could have gone into the relationship with her parents more, and definately though the other 'victims' of her behaviour could be brought into the story more... .

B000001GQT|5.0|Before we get to comparing this release to the earlier Decca recording made by Maestro Karajan in 1959/1960, let's talk a bit about Richard Strauss and his style.  Strauss was supremely gifted in pure musical terms and was an assiduous craftsman who mastered every component of the composer's arsenal -- and yet there is a lacunae there.  Sincerity?  Look elsewhere.  Passion?  Are the grandiose or intense passages in the tone poems on this CD simulated or for real?  I have my doubts about the honesty behind the writing.  As a result, it took me a long time to adjust to Strauss' style and recognize him for the great artist that he is.<br /><br />Let's put this a little differently: I believe Strauss' innate composure and cerebral tendencies makes his personality ill-suited to a late romantic style which often prized overblown statements and grand emotion.  The fact that he was able to write a whole set of great pieces within such a style is a testament to sheer musical talent overcoming an aesthetic environment to which it was unsuited.<br /><br />Strauss is a fascinating composer to analyze conceptually but on to the recording being reviewed.  Here is my summary of the two famed Karajan recordings, exactly duplicating each other:<br /><br />With Vienna Philharmonic (1959/60) (Decca): Emphasis on detail.  Sporadically brilliant and exciting.  Patricularly good \\"Till Eulenspiegel.\\"<br /><br />With Berlin Philharmonic (1973/74) (DG): Emphasis on broad lines - HvK concentrates on how the material is arranged and sequenced.  Sporadically brilliant and exciting, but in different places than the earlier Decca recordings.  A really exciting \\"Don Juan.\\"<br /><br />This is an unusual progression for a musician, if you think about it.  The more stereotypical pattern would be concentration on the broad musical flow earlier on in a career and, as the pieces became ever more familiar, a shift in  focus to the details of a score.  These Karajan recordings show the interpretive shift going in reverse.<br /><br />Which do I recommend among the two Karajan alternatives?  In a situation like this, I'd normally go with the CD with the better sonics but, in this case, I don't like the sound on either recording.  The earlier Decca is a bit murky; the later DG has too much distortion in the treble string passages and a homogenization of the timbral spectrum.  All the interpretations are very good and really serve as a pair of reference recordings in this repertory.  Call it a toss up.going in reverse.<br /><br />Which do I recommend among the two Karajan alternatives?

B00004C8TF|5.0|The opening two minutes of the \\"Also Sprach Zarathustra\\" contained here is certainly among the most widely-heard classical fragments ever, having been used in Stanley Kubrick's saga \\"2001.\\"  It also happens to be part of a recording that kept me off Richard Strauss for a long time as the first Strauss recording I bought.  Despite many listenings, I never really grew to like anything after the famed opening.  Years later, I grew more accepting; I was able to accept Richard Strauss as someone who faked the emotions in his music and who's Viennese schmaltz shtick (perhaps never more annoying and extraneous than in the overlong and irrelevant \\"Dance Song\\" (track 7) in Zarathustra) is a sort of lazy tick when he runs out of ideas -- without disliking him for it.  Emotions aren't everything in music.  And the Viennese schmaltz comes along only occasionally.  What's left is incredible musical skill and inventiveness.<br /><br />By contrast to \\"Zarathustra\\" - a piece which I still consider only partially successfully - \\"Don Juan\\" is clearly one of Strauss' best scores, intimating an association between the adept but ultimately unpassionate lover and the adept and ultimately unpassionate composer.  Besides any such extramusical interpretations, the music is just darned entertaining.  \\"Till Eulenspiegel\\" is another score that some perceive to display an identification between composer and Till's persona, but I don't see this one as Strauss is hardly a prankster.  Finally, the Salome Seven-Veils Dance is an orientalist fantasy and a supreme example of Strauss' orchestrational skill.<br /><br />Herbert von Karajan is certainly the most famous interpreter of Richard Strauss.  I think his biggest achievement in this repertory is the great \\"Salome\\" he recorded with Hildegard Behrens in the 1970s, but many would hold his \\"Zarathustra\\" and \\"Don Juan\\" in higher regard.  Karajan seems particularly interested in the details of these complex orchestral scores in these versions with the Vienna Philharmonic recorded in 1959 and 1960 - which I'd contrast with the more stripped down and purified interpretations of Strauss in the 1970s (not just \\"Salome\\" but the later Berlin Philharmonic recording covering the same repertory of the CD under review here).<br /><br />The only drawback is the sound engineering, which is murky, a surprise from the usually excellent Decca label.  The interpretations are very good, perhaps definitive in the minds of some listeners.  The \\"Till Eulenspiegel\\" here is particularly absorbing, but all the interpretations are very high quality.  Not a perfect disc but objectively a very good one.nic recorded in 1959 and 1960 - which I'd contrast with the more stripped down and purified interpretations of Strauss in the 1970s (not just \\"Salome\\" but the later Berlin Philharmonic recording covering the same repertory of the CD under review here).

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The character development went no where fast. The story line is weak. The more I read the less I cared about the characters and what happened to them. I didn't even finish the book and I understand more books will be coming in this series? Save your money and time!
B004PUG7MG|4.0|I love this CD! I've been listening to Avril since the beginning, and fall in love with each CD she brings out. There were more slow songs on the album than expected, but I enjoy them!
B009AMAJPA|4.0|Warning! Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />When I first saw its trailer in the theatre, I thought it was going to be another boring action movie with a plot that had been used hundreds of times. How wrong I was.<br /><br />For the first 40 minutes, the plot was original to me. I had never seen something like that before. Moreover, the acting of Noomi Rapace (playing Beatrice) was gripping and tormenting. The way she looked at him and talked to him, it sent chill down my spine. The hatred was unbearable . Then came the tormented love. I had heard of it before but this was the first time I saw it in a movie. She made it look so real it was very unsettling.<br /><br />Whenever Colin Farrell looked at her, he looked so focused and haunting that it made me feel uncomfortable and perplexed.<br /><br />This picture also covered friendship and revenge.<br /><br />The 3 twists at the end made it suspenseful, and entertaining.<br /><br />The action scenes were decisive, and exciting.<br /><br />Of course, there were some logical holes but they did not affect the entertaining value of this movie.<br /><br />After it finished, I felt the love was only one way. It might be because of the acting of one of the main characters.<br /><br />In summary, it's definitely worth watching. It deserves 4 stars.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Easy to use. It's fun collecting the items. And great to get to know other people. Fun times. I definitely recommend it.

B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Overall it works well and satisfies all my needs for word processing and spreadsheets. I haven't had any of the problems others here have complained about wrt to having to pay for the app twice. I also don't understand the fear mongering about permissions.  Not everything that requests certain permissions is spyware. The problem I do have is that Google Drive integration has been broken for the last few updates. I emailed the publisher about it 3 updates ago and they said they were aware of it and a fix was coming. Yeah, well we're still waiting. It would be great if you'd get around to releasing that fix.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|I like the game, but, I have had to shutdown my Kindle Fire over 25 times to get out of the software after it hung to use other software.<br /><br />The best parts of game cost real money with no way to earn or trade other game tokens.<br /><br />If they fix the initialization process, this game would be fun.

When it came he wouldn't put it down and when he finished reading it he told me I would have to read it. The look on his face was well worth the money I spent to get it for him! Plus the book was delivered earlier than expected so that's a big plus!! Great buy for any Legend of Zelda fan!!

B00BTHWFBK|4.0|As a huge fan of the original line-up, I'm happy to have this final gift from the Brummies (hopefully, this will be their swan song...hate to see them jump the shark). Most of the songs harken to the early days as they are stripped down, long, and dreary. Some even tap into the old Sabbath swing found in Fairies Wear Boots and Warning. My favorites were Zeitgest (jazzy deja vu) and Damaged Soul (the harmonica returns, baby!). The only gripe is that many of the riffs and melodies are forgettable...I'd take the maligned experiment of Never Say Die, whose tunes I can hum at the drop of a hat, over this any day. But don't get me wrong; it's still a fine effort on the level of Oz's recent solo material.

6304698798|5.0|This movie by far is the most entertaining, dramatic and epic. First of all, this movie involves great characters with great backgrounds. Secondly, the whole story line is based on a lot of money and seeing which outlaw can get to it first. And third, I know the movie is close to being 3 hours long, but the whole time, your just sitting on your edge of your seat waiting to see what's going to happen next. All in all, this movie is great and I will play it until it skips!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Action, start to finish. I had a neck ache from not moving from the couch, it did what a movie should. It will keep your attention if this is your thing.

I think this book was much darker than Gone Girl and I may not have given Gillian Flynn another chance had I read this one first.  Her writing is very good and there was a decent story, with twists.  It was just a little too dark for my personal taste.
1781162646|4.0|Devin Jones, recovering from the heartache of losing his girl, takes a job at an amusement park during the summer of '73. The park in question has lost its shine. It's lure is the fact that it's old fashioned fun with your typical rides and carnival attractions but each years it's a struggle to keep things going. You have your long time employees such as Lane Hardy and Madame Fortuna, but the lifeblood of the park seems to be the kids that work there over the summer.<br /><br />Devin finds himself a room to rent and meets Erin and Tom. Both students trying to make a little money over the summer. They become his family while at Joyland along with a host of regulars to keep things interesting. But what interests them the most is the murder that took place at the park years ago. Linda Gray and her boyfriend visited Horror House together but only one of them came out alive. Rumor has it that Linda's throat was cut by her boyfriend and her body was thrown aside for employees to find later. The case was never solved but the repeated ghost sightings of Linda herself pique the interest of Devin and his friends. Enough for them to want to investigate the murder themselves.<br /><br />Fans of Stephen King know that he writes a lot more than horror and this is one of those times. I think it's safe to say that Joyland has been marketed as crime fiction and it is that, but only in the very loosest sense of the term. It's not much of a \\"who-done-it\\" as there isn't a whole lot of suspense to keep the story going. In fact, much of it felt a little lazy to me... lazy in the way a long, hot summer can be. The relaxed nature of the story seemed to take center stage, not so much the anticipation of solving the crime itself. Joyland was more of an experience, than a story to me but that's not a bad thing. King has a way with setting the stage and the stage he set was welcoming to me in some odd way.<br /><br />When the story meandered a bit and a young boy with a serious illness was introduced and ended up playing a central character in the story itself, I knew then that the murder was really just a backdrop for the summer that Devin needed to experience in order to move on to the next stage of his life. Truthfully, I didn't mind this but Joyland felt more like a novella than a novel which left me wanting a little bit more.<br /><br />Calling this a ghost story is a real stretch so if you pick it up for that alone, you might be disappointed. BUT, big but, it's classic King. He knows how to paint a scene and he knows his characters. I love the little catch phrases he uses repeatedly throughout his books, too. It gives you a sense of existing within whatever construct he's created on the page and you are successfully taken out of his world, and put into his world, often front and center.<br /><br />Overall, it was an entertaining, fun read. I loved the amusement park lingo and the overall sense of place that King created but as crime fiction, there was little in the way of suspense and the resolution was rather anti-climactic. Not one of my faves but worth reading nonetheless. Especially for readers who have shied away from King before. This would be a good book to read as an introduction to King's work.roduced and ended up playing a central character in the story itself, I knew then that the murder was really just a backdrop for the summer that Devin needed to experience in order to move on to the next stage of his life.

Why they think they have to do that is beyond me. does special edition mean trash you cant watch with your family? Im going to think hard before I buy any more movies from Amazon.  PS I worked in a power plant so im not a goody two shoes but I don't welcome that stuff in my home.
B009AMANBA|4.0|Lincoln is the Republican president at the peak of his powers in the last few months of his life when he was about to pass the 13th Amendment to the Constitution through the House of Representatives to abolish slavery.Speilberg has covered 80 pages in a 500 page script by Tony Kuchner, that highlights this episode, from Goodwin's Team of Rivals:The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,in the dying days of the Civil War.The president(Day Lewis) has quoted back to him the end of the Gettysburg Address by a feisty black soldier,setting up the framework for the establishment of racial equality.The film is replete with muted interiors, dark colours by Speilberg's cinematographer Kaminski.Lincoln himself is often shot in shadow or in silhouette.The streets and yards in the capital or in Petersburg are grey,dirty,desolate.This forms part of his trilogy of films(Color Purple,Amistad )on the black experience in America.<br /><br />Republicans were then the progressive party,Democrats believed negroes inferior to the white race, that abolition will prolong the war.The Republicans urge the passing of the amendment before the war ends(lest the readmission of the Southern States into the Union block abolition), the radical Republicans,led by the outspoken abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens(Tommy Lee Jones),will seek immediate black enfranchisement.Day Lewis gets under the skin of the character,breathing life into the sculpted monument,by deflating his pomposity with jokes,stories, telling anecdotes,pitching the voice in an upper register,cutting short his speeches.His public life is balanced by his tempestuous relationship with his wife Mary(Field) and eldest son Robert(Gordon-Levitt),whose decision to enlist mortifies his mother.Lincoln needs the wholehearted support of his cabinet,especially William H.Seward ,his secretary of state(Strathairn),who delegates the dirty work to lobbyists(Spader, Hawkes,Blake Nelson),who use patronage,cash gifts to buy the 20 votes needed.<br /><br />Lincoln persuades Stevens not to go for black enfranchisement,'true north' if it leads into a swamp.He leans on others who despise slavery but are frightened of freed slaves.Lincoln knew that abolition must precede the end of war.Day Lewis shows him as a canny dissembler for a principle or cause,a family man who carries his boy to bed or strikes his eldest boy's face for blurting that his father fears his mother.He's loving towards his wife but she can make his life hell.But his patience is tested by her grief for their 3rd son Willie.Day Lewis's portrayal is stooping,grizzled,bowed,sunken, deathly.Lee Jones is acerbic as Stevens able to terrify subordinates or mock the wordy.Lincoln is seen in backroom deals or hiding out from the halos of history, playing withhis son Tad.There are excellent cameo roles for character actors,Lee Pace as Fernando Wood,Jackie Earle Haley as VP Alexander H. Stephens,James Spader as a verminous lobbyist.Strathairn is superb.Lincoln walks off into history espied by a black staffer.The clichés of `honest Abe'' are avoided in a very good biopic.
0738737909|5.0|Found imaginary on Daviantart.com and was in awe. Found out there would be a full deck and immediately pre-ordered!!  I have about 6 tarot decks in my collection so far, but for whatever reason, I could only &#34;see&#34; in my Tarot of Dreams from Marchetti. I was soo excited to see so much in this deck!! Just gorgeous, every card!
B004LWZWC4|5.0|My husband and I love this movie. Funny, clean, and about quirky birding.  It is on our favorite movies list.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I really like this product because it actually utilizes the magnetic port on your Nexus 10. I can’t count how many times I’ve tripped on the wire only to have the POGO piece safely come unplugged and not bring down my tablet crashing down with it.<br /><br />The best part about this is that it doesn't go into the Micro usb port which in my experience can become flimsy and loose with constant plugging and unplugging, which if you bought it through Google like I did, I want to avoid having to send it back for repairs if I can avoid it.<br /><br />Although I’m only getting around to putting the review up now (Sorry guys!) I’ve had this product since March when I got my product and sadly I cannot comment on if it charges the tablet any quicker than when plugged into the wall using the Micro USB plug.<br /><br />I can attest to the fact that you can charge and play videogames or watch movies / stream videos on it at the same time though and it will not just slowly drain or keep at the same level.<br /><br />I would recommend if you are planning on keeping your Nexus 10 for a while.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|It was a really great book. If you liked the book Matched, then you'll love this this book. Can't wait to read the next one!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I got this app for my kids and I fell in love with it . And it's even better because it's free
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've always liked the weather underground website because of the amount of information but they didn't have an app for my tablet. Wasn't really happy with the weather channel app either as it was just basic weather plus didn't like the upgrades.<br />This app gives LOTS of info from simply just seeing what the day's weather will be to monitoring possible tropical storms (which is what I'm doing). My only suggestion is maybe more personal settings for the user but other than that it's great. This is now my go to weather app on  my tablet.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|Love this movie, just had to get it. Old school movie, lol. It came on time & in perfect condition. I'm glad with this purchase.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|James Rollins does it again! I couldn't read fast enough. He writes with just the right touch of humor mingled throughout to make the characters so credible. His books take the reader to various places around the world, and the descriptions allow you to feel as if you are there. Bring on more Sigma Force!
B005C8ENI0|3.0|Did Harry Bosch character figure in the plot in the book?<br />Movie not as good as the book.<br />McConaughey good choice, however.<br />Scene-to-scene lacked continuity.

1781162646|5.0|A perfect summer book. Short, engrossing, & satisfying. A young man who works for a summer theme park. An old murder, a sometime ghost, a psychic boy, and a broken heart. This book is like a scooby-doo mystery: you see it coming but you don't care because you love the characters, you love the mystery. Stephen King in high form. I will definitely be checking out more Hard Case Crime fiction. HCCF is a publishing press that nostalgically looks back at 30s, 40s, & 50s style hard-boiled mysteries. Short books that pack a punch. Definitely what I was needing.
1608871827|5.0|This is a great book and first class all the way. All &#34;making of&#34; movie books should be this great. Tons of extras too. All the giant robots and giant monsters are here in super high clarity photos and all the behind-the-scenes and pre-production art is here as well. There is nothing bad to say about this book. Plus do not forget the posters which are in an envelope inside the back cover - kind of like a bonus present. Wow! Super first class all the way!
B000GWE44U|2.0|I know i'm with the minority here, but to tell you the truth almost stop watching it after 1 hr. Nothing happened. I endured just to watch the end. I was very disappointed.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|I really enjoy all the dash games. I have played all of the free trials.Very addicting. My only problem is I feel cheated. It says that when you purchase this game, you get 5 levels plus 10 bonus levels. Does not clearly state that you have to pay extra for the 10 bonus levels. Because of this I only bought this one and none of the others...don't want to be mislead again
0399160450|5.0|Tom Clancy fan, could not put the book down.  Jr. continues to carry the sword for Jack Sr. I cannot wait for the next one.
0345803450|4.0|The title gives the impression of a confection, but actually it refers to a fictional undercover operation during the 70s in which MI5 secretly funds 10 writers with anti-Communist leanings.  Serena Frome's job at MI5--up until Sweet Tooth comes along--has been basically clerical.  Her favorite pastime--reading fiction--has won her a role in Sweet Tooth, recruiting and mentoring an aspiring novelist named Tom Haley.  They fall in love, but Tom is in the dark about Serena's true occupation and the role of MI5 in sponsoring his work.  These secrets haunt Serena, as she attempts to convince herself that their relationship can thrive without her divulging these unpleasant facts.  The secondary characters actually have the juicier roles.  Serena's former married lover, now deceased, dumped her in a very hurtful manner, for reasons not revealed until later in the book.  Her lower-class friend and co-worker Shirley seems bent on sabotaging Serena's position at MI5.  Then there's Max, Serena's superior at MI5, on whom Serena has a crush before she meets Tom.  Max initially spurns Serena's advances because of his upcoming arranged marriage, but then he does an about-face, which has a disastrous impact on Serena's job and personal life.  In other words, most everyone has some sort of hidden agenda.  Certainly all of this intrigue has its appeal, even if national security is not at stake, but I was particularly entertained by Tom's short stories, which Serena summarizes for us during her vetting of Tom as a candidate for Sweet Tooth.  The one called \\"Pawnology\\" is my favorite, as it delivers a surprising and twisty punch.  Also, Serena provides a very enlightening explanation of the Monty Hall probability riddle.  Then Tom builds a story on it but misses a key aspect of the riddle.  Serena's rewrite and million-door analogy make the solution crystal clear.  She may have been a mediocre math student at Cambridge, but she grasps more than we give her credit for.  So does Tom forthat matter.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I love this movie (right along with all the other Nicolas Sparks movies). I don't read the books, so I don't have an opinion about how this is in comparison. I wish that all movies could be produced without the language and steamy scenes, this has a couple of scenes, but are mild in comparison to other movies.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I decided to look for a youtube app because I can never watch a long video on my kindle without it stopping or disconnecting.

I don't see how you can f up an app like this. I have the youtube app on my itouch I don't see why amazon cant make one for the kindle

0385342071|5.0|I have read all of Kinsella books and for me this one is right up there with the Shopaholic series.  I'm almost through it and cannot wait to find out what is gong to happen. Like one reviewer stated, I guessed what was going to happen but how it happened was the fun of it.  Thanks Kinsella for another good one.

B0072OFM28|2.0|I would have to agree with all the bad reviews, this is just not the same as blood and sand and gods of the arena. Too much fake blood n gore too much fake sex, NO story!!! It was nice to see a lot of the characters from the 1st season and G.O.T.A and the new Spartacus is no Andy but he's not bad, in fact I think he was too good for the junky role and never really got to shine, something happen after Andy died that's left me thinking they went with less story more blood and sex trying to attract new viewers thinking the old 1s will stay loyal or wont? IDK it just feels like they changed everything up trying to get fresh viewers and it only disappointed the old 1's.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|The fourteenth proper album from Megadeth finds the band returning to its early-Nineties/\\"Countdown To Extinction\\" era, as 2013's \\"Super Collider\\" is a crunchy and mostly mid-tempo effort, instead of being another blistering piece of straight-up thrash like we are used to hearing from Mustaine and the Boys. So even though it is laced with some tasty guitar licks and really remarkable solos, one can't help but feel that this is kind of a disappointing release. It is decent through and through, but when placed along `Deth's best works, it is kind of lacking.<br /><br />The album begins in strong enough fashion, with \\"Kingmaker\\" being a catchy, thrashy chugger anchored by swift, pounding skins (including some double bass thudding), and topped off by a few blazing solos. And \\"Burn!\\" is even more remarkable, as some delicious, pyrotechnic guitar shredding abounds throughout it. (This includes a wailing, nearly classical-music-sounding solo run, and some tasty, wah-wah-tinged leads.) It is perfectly fitting, then, that the song's lyrics revolve around fire, with Mustaine spouting memorable lines like \\"burn, baby burn,\\" and \\"the flames are getting tall!\\"<br /><br />But it is after that, though, that \\"S.C.\\" begins to lose steam, finding the momentum and energy levels tapering off significantly with a handful of thoroughly unremarkable tracks in the title cut, \\"Dance In The Rain,\\" \\"Beginning Of Sorrow\\" (which does feature a noteworthy bass intro, but is otherwise fairly boring), and \\"Forget To Remember.\\" There are some moments that show substantial promise, though, like \\"Built For War,\\" a fairly fiery and very charging thrasher, and \\"Off The Edge,\\" which is filled with catchy, galloping riffs, memorable vocal hooks, and an epic, trade-off melodic-shred solo section.<br /><br />And there are other standout tracks in the album's latter-half, too, including \\"The Blackest Croow,\\" a bluegrass/Southern rock-flavored acoustic strummer. \\"Don't Turn Your Back...\\" is also a possible highpoint in that it is a slow and restrained number with slower, and more involved melodic soloing (including one of the record's best -- if not THE best -- and most infectious, lengthy, wailing, and air-guitar-able solo flights); and \\"Cold Seat,\\" an again up-tempo and aggressive Thin Lizzy cover that serves as a strong set closer, and one that features more terrific soloing.<br /><br />But none of these above-described moments are good enough to be amazing or rival anything heard on Megadeth's say, \\"Rust In Peace\\" or \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying\\" (or even 2011's \\"Thirteen\\" and/or 2009's \\"Endgame\\").  As such, \\"Super Collider\\" is a strictly solid if unspectacular effort that can only be recommended to hardcore `Deth heads. And 3.5 stars is precisely what this album deserves because it is far from being a great one, and even further from being a bad one.ighpoint in that it is a slow and restrained number with slower, and more involved melodic soloing (including one of the record's best -- if not THE best -- and most infectious, lengthy, wailing, and air-guitar-able solo flights); and \\"Cold Seat,\\" an again up-tempo and aggressive Thin Lizzy cover that serves as a strong set closer, and one that features more terrific soloing.<br /><br />But none of these above-described moments are good enough to be amazing or rival anything heard on Megadeth's say, \\"Rust In Peace\\" or \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying\\" (or even 2011's \\"Thirteen\\" and/or 2009's \\"Endgame\\").

B00B9LNK5G|5.0|John Grant hasn't been kind to life, and to that same token, life hasn't been kind to John Grant.<br /><br />For somebody relatively young, he's had his fair share of low self-esteem. Couple this with substance abuse that spiraled into a full addiction and a subsequent HIV+ diagnosis, and you'd wonder why he even gets up in the morning. This is then followed by a very bitter breakup. Hard to believe a six month relationship could spark the witty hatred that makes up Grant's second LP Pale Green Ghosts; but I guess when you add up all the negative experiences Grant has ever had in his life, blend it with some fruit juice and nicotine, you have the perfect recipe for 2013's best break-up album.<br /><br />I'm a newcomer to Grant's defensive brand of indie pop/rock, but something tells me his audiences have broadened since his time with The Czars. And that's fine. What John Grant does better than any other openly gay songwriter is make his emotions valid without restarting to musical cheese and ultimate alienation. He's probably the first to truly sing about his relationships with men (male pronouns abundant) and not have that be the focal point of the record. He's not Elton John or Gregory Douglass, who seem to refuse to sing about men candidly. He's not Adam Lambert, because he's not an overtly sexual pop star a la Janet Jackson. He's close to Matt Alber mixed with some Depeche Mode and Duran Duran influence. Pale Green Ghosts finds Grant in a much more comfortable place than on Queen of Denmark, which was stark and naked. While Ghosts contains more brilliantly open songwriting, it is wrapped in an Icelandic electronic bow. This isn't Stuart Price or Richard Morel dance music, though. It's more a nod to Björk's masterpiece Homogenic or Klas Aslund's work with Swedish songwriter Robyn. It is surprising-- given the man and given the album jacket art. But above all, it is smart.<br /><br />Pale Green Ghosts bounces between two distinct genres, and does so at a fascinating pace. Most of the album is electronic and synth-based. Very subtle and somber in its approach (even at its most uptempo). But there are more traditional indie rock songs on this record with a folk-meets-college-radio vibe-- leading single GMF (Greatest Mother...) and album closer Glacier. These don't experiment with sound as much as they stew in tried traditional. Piano, drums, guitar. Blend well and cook at -500 degrees and see what you get. Although the record is a little schizoid in its haphazard switching between dance and rock, it's the album's core balladry that ties it all together. A sweeping collection of songs that need time to breathe. And in that time, they will dig their way deep beneath your brain. But I will say that the production on the album does not entirely do the music justice. Hearing these songs played live is far more satisfying than hearing Queen of Denmark's material live. They just sparkle and shine like they were supposed. Grant, who is far more charismatic than he might believe, performs these songs fearlessly and without apology. His filthy mouth and subtly sexy swagger couple with his humility, and he belts the lyrics with such a strong conviction, you cannot help but be captivated by his efforts.<br /><br />Melodically stunning, lyrically intelligent and vocally captivating, Pale Green Ghosts is a masterpiece. And one of the most important albums for gay men and women. And hey, the straights like it, too!<br /><br />Pale Green Ghosts - ✓<br />Black Belt - ✓+<br />GMF - ✓+<br />Vietnam - ✓<br />It Doesn't Matter to Him - ✓+<br />Why Don't You Love Me Anymore - ✓<br />You Don't Have to - ✓+<br />Sensitive New Age Guy - ✓<br />Ernest Borgnine - ✓+<br />I Hate This Town - ✓+<br />Glacier - ✓
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|This is a drawing application that's just fun to mess around with.<br /><br />You can make some very cool color patterns and I love the effects.<br /><br />Definitely worth a free download and even. 99
B007H7XJD4|3.0|I guess it was a lot better in the theater, on line it was way to dark. Half the movie was listening only.<br /> I liked it though. Not knowing to much mythology I could follow along okay .<br />Some reminded me of  the 300, which I really liked.<br />Henry Cavill is so cute! Thought he was the handsomest Superman there was.:)
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This is not an easy movie to watch.  It has a lot of dialects in it and it flashes back and forth a bit.  The book is apparently outstanding.  I liked this quite a bit but I think I missed some information and I need to watch it again which isn't a big problem but it is a long movie so it's difficult to dedicate the time to.  It's got good ideas in it.  It's a pretty movie although it's a bit violent and there are certainly unsettling parts.  Probably should be required viewing.  Regards,
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|A note, this isn't a \\"drawing\\" app, like sketch pro, but it IS still a drawing app, just with the use of a type of brush stroke instead of pencil/pen drawing.<br /><br />This is an app much like sketch guru, except you only have one option for a type of brush (yes, you have multiple choices, but unless I'm blind, they all similar). A plus side, this app lets you both delete the picture AND there's a backspace button--always appreciated in any drawing app. Another good thing, there's the option to change color, line length, wave point, and wave length. I enjoy that you can change the draw mode from touch to continuous. Touch let's you somewhat control the growth of the brush line as you can continue pressing down on the screen for it to grow (or bold the line, depending on what you're doing); whereas, continuous automatically continues growing the line.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very nicely done drawing app--though I prefer a drawing app that you can use pencil, pen, etc. to draw. For $2, it seems steep but it is worth it. A warning, though, if you're looking for a drawing app like isketch, pass this one up. If you're not sure whether or not to get it, I recommend trying the free sketch guru to get a feeling of what kind of drawing app this is. However, if you do enjoy drawing apps like this one, I would recommend you get it!

B00005JLEU|5.0|This is my favorite Miyazaki flim and again highlights the environmental themes so common in Miyazaki's work, combined with the coming of age story of Chihiro/Sen and the changing social traditions of Japan. The animation in Spirited Away is gorgeous with wonderful, water color like colors, natural movement and a dream like air. The music is top notch and combines with the animation to transport you to this mystical world.<br /><br />I have no problems with the Disney English adaption and believe the work still stands as a Miyazaki masterpiece.<br /><br />My children enjoy this film a lot - especially my girls.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great flow to his life and how he as a creator was portrayed. One of my favorite books of all time. Must read
B00003CXBK|5.0|If you are interested in Miyazaki's flims and animations this is a great film to check out. If you are like me and already loved this film, this is a fine DVD of it. Princess Mononoke continues many of Miyazaki's themes concerning environment and politics. His animation, creativity and mastery of movement and ethereal, Japanese painting like colors are showcased in this film.<br /><br />I was not sure if my kids would also enjoy this film but they do - both young and teenagers girls and boys.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Good episodes and there's no doubt however, would be nice if they had HD episodes in season 1 2 and 3.

B0029XFN8A|5.0|As it wasn't playing, I was not happy and gave this a bad review.  I'm starting to get tired of the bull crap \\"Protection\\" on everything.  I now know it's the Pioneer BDP 53FD player, replaced with an Oppo.  The disk works fine.

1781162646|5.0|After being disappointed in the last few King books, I am excited to say that I believe this new novel is one of the best he's ever written. Those who anticipate a horror novel will perhaps be disappointed, since this one has no really creepy bits and only a touch of the supernatural. Admittedly, King is the Modern Master of Scarey; the novel 'It' gave me bad dreams for weeks and I still feel anxious when I think about it. But he is capable of excelling in other genres as well: post-apocalyptic ('The Stand'), psychological thriller('Misery'), fantasy ('The Dark Tower' series), western (again 'The Dark Tower'), historical ('11/22/63'), mystery ('The Colorado Kid'), and coming-of-age (many of his novels, most notably the novella \\"The Body\\").<br /><br />Joyland is a combination of genres, as are many King books. It's a mystery thriller with a few supernatural aspects combined with a very convincing coming-of-age story. The hero (in every sense of the word) is a 21-year-old college student with a heart which has been broken by his first love who takes a summer job at an old-style amusement park, where he encounters a mystery, perhaps a ghost, danger, and the untimely deaths of innocents. Most of all he grows up.<br /><br />King has an uncanny ability to delineate characters who seem so real you feel as if you could pick them out in a crowd. He is surprisingly adept, at age 60+, at conveying what it feels like to be young and confused. These talents are on display here in spades.<br /><br />Many would denigrate King and classify him as a genre hack, but if a reader is looking for a good story with believable characters, an understanding of real people and how they behave in situations of stress, prose that is highly readable and natural, and even important themes that are relevant to real life, Stephen King, when he is at his best, is your man.
B0084AZXKK|2.0|The story is still a great treasure, but the reading of this audio version is almost impossible to listen to.  Maybe it's computerized, but it couldn't be by a native speaker because the phrasing is off on almost every sentence.  We like to listen to books on tape on long driving trips, but ended up buying a written version and reading aloud to each other.

But when i read them after wards whoa was I surprised . I love their story and am glad it will go on, I feel there's so much more to get into. Lets be honest anyone who has read the 50 Shades Trilogy wishes there was more, I know I sure do. Cant wait for the next books in the Crossfire series ;)
030758836X|4.0|Page turner.  I loved the book until the end.  I would have preferred a different ending but the book is memorable.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I could not put the book down.  Always wanting to know what came next for Gideon and Eva...and the Entwined with You ended too soon.  Can't wait for the next instalment.
B00915G6WQ|3.0|I love the show Dexter.  I've watched it since the beginning.  Each season would get better as he became more comfortable with who he is.  In prior seasons, he would seem to lose control but not quite.  This season he did lose control.  At times he seemed to abdicate his responsibility to those around him and do stupid things for someone trying to hide this significant a secret.  The season ending also left me bewildered as to how do you cover up or spin what happened?  Or maybe that is the hook that brings me back for the next season?
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This was the best movie I have seen in years.  Excellent actors, who who submitted the sad subject in an objective and humorous way.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I love all of Gillian Flynn's novels!  They are full of twists and turns that keep your attention.  I also love that it does not take long to get into her books.  The excitement begins very quickly.  Glad I found this author!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Well I am a huge Downton Abbey fan and HAD to buy this to get caught up.  I loved every minute of it until the finale... not happy about that.  But I won't put in any spoilers - just not happy with the ending.  Looking forward to next season!
B008J5G1TW|4.0|already have owned several pairs,  always good and comfortable, I would recommend these for anyone who needs to be on their feet
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It's Angry Birds, what's not to love? I love pretty much all the Angry Birds games.  I totally recommend it.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|The rise and fall of a gangster. This is a must see classic tale. Be advised that it is not a movie for children. It does contain harsh language, and violence.
B009LLLJ40|3.0|If you ask me, Slayer has really gone down hill. It never really grabbed on and pulled me in like other Slayer works. The song Jihad is possibly the best song on the whole album. I can't really give a good review because I'm not a huge fan of the modern era Slayer. If you miss it--you're not missing much.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is prob be 1of the best free games there needs to be more free games like this its a bit time consuming
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|The new Alice In Chains is never going to amount to the older works with Layne Staley. The main reason I bought this album was because I thought &#34;Stone&#34; was a great song. The title track, &#34;Pretty Done&#34;, and &#34;Lab Monkey&#34; are really solid tracks. This is a lot different than Black Gives Way to Blue and I definitely think it's worth a listen.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game makes your brain work extremely hard! Great game! My son and I had a great time defeating each level.
0553801473|5.0|This book is great and when it rapidly picks up pace of events closer to the end, the actual end of the book feels like stopping at the cliff. You desperately want to know what happens the very next day with multiple story lines converging around one city, but you could not.<br /><br />I want to buy book 6.<br />Except there is not book 6 yet. ;)
B00013M6NK|5.0|Good price on Nikon brand battery. Safer to stick with same brand as camera to not void warranty and nice to have a back-up.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|I am not an avid reader by an means but couldn't put it down!  Its a bit odd, but I felt compelled to read on and find out what happens to person (Billy) who becomes un-stuck in time.  I would recommend this book to anyone even someone I disliked.  Well worth the day I put into it!
B00A2H9P98|3.0|This movie wasn't bad but....it wasn't good either; it was just \\"ok\\". It seemed slow, even the action scenes were slow!!  I can't quite put my finger on what went wrong with this movie.  Everyone seemed to fall flat in this, even Jamie Foxx who is usually pretty good (all I could see was Malcolm X when he put his glasses on - I'm still trying to figure out if that was their intent?). And I had no idea James Woods (a bad guy as usual) was in this!  Sadly, I found myself wanting to see the terrorists rather than the heroes (I liked the terrorist named Motts for some reason. He was even good at shooting!).  The posters for this movie all looked so good/dramatic but...*sigh* something is just missing.<br /><br />I think they were trying to recreate a bit of Lethal Weapon with White House Down but the comedic parts weren't funny, the only chuckles I heard were when the WH tour guide did something (however, I did chuckle when Jamie Foxx had to put his glasses on to shoot).  Even the two terrorists who were supposed to be funny...just somehow didn't fit (they did a good job of being 'crazy' but they just didn't seem to be in the right movie?) The action scenes were so drawn out and I couldn't figure out why a guy who was supposed to be a policeman and was in really buff shape got the crap beat out of him by a more scrawny guy.  I think the drawn out action scenes were so we could spend time looking at Channing Tatum.  The poor guy had an awful lot of people to save and plots to finish.<br /><br />I don't mean to be overly critical because I know it's just a movie and movies (like books) are someone's babies and I do love a good action movie; I think Channing Tatum should really focus on his acting for now (apparently he was also executive producer) and try producing later on when he gets more experience, and hopefully when White House Down is released on DVD, they have taken the time to clean up the scenes somehow, it would speed up the action a bit (maybe there are scenesmissing in this or too many scenes and storylines...I'm not sure which one it is - I just can't quite put my finger on it, it's driving me crazy!).  I feel sort of bad for Channing Tatum, he seems to be one of the few decent people in Hollywood (and we need more of those!) that I do want to say something nice about this movie. I certainly wouldn't say I wouldn't watch it again.  I would watch this sometime in the future, like maybe when it's on t.v. or something.  It was ok, but it could've been sooooo much more!  I could like this in the future, it could grow on me.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I cannot navigate within the app in a meaningful way. It does not help that although I am trying out a prime membership, I have no access to the lending library either. Way to alienate us androids :)
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It's very helpful (: I love this dictionary. it's amazing. I even use it for school. I recommend this for everyone!!!!
B008M7JODC|5.0|I waited until the end of the last episode to watch this series. Well worth the wait. However I still don't have season five because its not on amazon prime yet and only the last five episodes on xfinity on demand. Damn you Comcast.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I really enjoyed this one of this author, I read the Kite Runner. This story was not so intense , I would say it was lighter, but still excellent
B005IQZB14|4.0|I don't know if I have anything new to add to the reviews, other than to say that they seem to have fixed the \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" glitch.  I read the entire book and there were no intrusive highlights (other than the ones I left).  The threat of getting The Queen of All Media's Intimate Thoughts On The Book kept me from purchasing the book for a long time, but I finally gave in and was happy to see that my wait paid off.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Believe in yourself is what I took away from this movie. Hope I have this much courage when (and if) this happens to me.
0316044695|5.0|I will start by saying I hate reading.  But when I found out I had to travel overseas I decided to buy a book to read on the flight.  I could not put this book down.  This book is full of action and fighting.  It is unbelievable.  It makes me love america even more.  Buy it and you wont be dissappointed.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|Well written and acted. Can't figure out what's going on. Love to hate Patty and not trust her, but she looks so innocent and truthful as she lies to &#34;you.&#34; Lenny is everyone's friend and an honest/loyal guy, right?
0525953728|5.0|If you love america, you will love this book.  Everyone hates Osama, Correct?  This book brings the insight about how much effort and time we spent on finding him.  Its amazing how well trained the Armed forces are.  If you a looking for a book that is absolutly kicka**, this is the book for you.  I hate reading, but I loved reading this book.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|If this wasn't a true story, it's hard to believe they made it through this torture. Makes me believe there is a God watching over us.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|The show numbers are outstanding and the story line keeps you wanting more! The cast is well-suited for their rolls. You'll want to pick sides, but will end up changing your mind.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book to others. It had a great story plot and the characters seemed very real. Katniss's problems seemed like they could actually had happened and were not just some wonderful life of a perfect girl. I loved the ending and as sad as it was to see many deaths of characters I liked like (SPOILER ALERT!!) Finnick and especially Prim, it made the story more realistic because it showed that people who are doing the right thing can die or have bad things happen to them in real life. All in all it was a great book and a wonderful ending to an amazing series.
B00846REIS|4.0|Yes, there are similarities to Fifty Shades, but they are few.  Billionaire falls for a girl and likes to be in charge of all aspects of his life.  Both characters have a past.  Ok, that's where the similarities end.<br />Yes, Gideon does a few things that are over the top (like the recreation of Eva's bedroom), but he is a very intense guy.  Eva falls for him quickly and their relationship turns hot very quickly.  The sex scenes are hot.  Eva is a sassy, no-nonsense type of person that puts Gideon in his place a few times.<br />This is a great summer read!
B001W8XUBK|5.0|Amazingly! This 1922 Movie is still one of the best vampire movies available.<br />I was very surprised A movie of that era would be as well made as this one, I'm sure that's why it continues to endure after 90+ years. The Quality of the video and sound was also extremely good.<br /><br />TCT
B009PHRIAE|5.0|This is a fabulous set (and a marvelous bargain) for any lover of the recorder.  Brüggen's playing is terrific (he is a superb conductor, so it's no surprise that his recorder playing is eminently musical).<br /><br />I wish that there were a little more information about some of the more obscure composers, but at this price, it's hard to complain.  Probably too much for anyone who isn't fan of the recorder, or Baroque music in general, but if you have any interest at all, snap this up while it's available.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|At first it downloads like it's supposed to but after install and launch it wants to update and will not download
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|terradaca I find the game to be very enjoyable.I mean playing pirates and all has to.be a blast.  the game slows down the tarter you gonbecause of the price of explaining.good all around game and its free
B00B3YLI8U|5.0|Excellent book - highly recommended - fascinating characters.  It's a long book but well worth the effort - take the time to read it!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This was the most romantic book I have ever read. It can't have been easy to write, so I thank the author for sharing a truly dark hero and survivor heroine. I've already read it twice an will no doubt read it about ten times more. It is perfect.
B0010YQ9F0|4.0|Good collection of '50s and early '60s music.  Brings back many pleasant memories (as well as some that were not so good)
076790382X|2.0|Bryson was at his best with \\"A Walk in the Woods\\".  What I've realized is that the trek kept him on topic, meaningful, and entertaining.  When forced to come up with articles on a deadline, which this book is a collection of, he grasps at topics, occasionally on target, but most times exaggerating for no real reason, or just whining about things.  He doesn't bring a picture ID to the airport but it's the airline people who are the idiots.  A restaurant has a sign to tell you to wait to be seated, but he sits anyway, oblivious to the fact that they may want to balance the customer load among the wait staff or have closed sections, and then degrades the staff.<br /><br />And on and on it goes.  It's a lot like reading \\"The Worst of Dave Barry\\".  Maybe if I liked Dave Barry style satire I'd like this better, but I still don't think Bryson's satire is very good.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Great collection at a good price. I dislike Cyrstal Skull so much, but couldn't pass on the chance to the get the first 3 while it was the Gold Box deal.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|The game is a great improvement, but it won't let me make in app purchases. I bought the Deadwalker deck both with coins and money, but it's still locked. If they fix this problem, I'll give it 5 stars.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not too difficult but challenging enough to keep you interested.  Would definitely like more levels yo get through.  Fun game for passing the time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is great!  Totally intuitive, it looks and responds just like a desktop calculator.  I have it on my kindle fire and it works flawlessly.
B004Q9TK98|3.0|I enjoyed this book enough to finish it.  That's  about all I can say. Bit of a corny ending.  Not 100% recommended.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very unique game with a variety of challenging puzzles. I can't wait to see what they come up with next.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was hoping that this book would be as engaging as The<br />Kite Runner. It was that and more. So beautifully written-it was easy to &#34;see&#34; the rich images that Mr. Hosseini described. One of my all time favorites!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|i love this series and can't wait to buy the second and third. Could watch this series over and over
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Mr. Gaiman draws us into our past, our fears and hopes, our homely comforts and all too frequent pain of relationship and how our childhood impacts our lives. He draws in with his simple language hiding some interesting constructs. He draws us in with images of our own past and our own reflections on it. For those that listen to the audio book, he draws us in with his voice and pacing. He draws us home only to realize that home is on the other side of the looking glass, down the rabbit hole and more warped than we like to remember.<br /><br />This book is about remembered childhood, relationships and fantastical elements slipped into our lives, real or imagined by the characters. There are sacrificial goddess-friends, manipulative other-worldly creatures and a child in the land of giants, aka adults. As an adult, the protagonist revisits his childhood and in revisiting awakes to the experiences of it as perceived when he was 7. For us, it's a journey into our own memories, challenges and current relationships. While good and bad is writ on a large scale of abusive near-drowning, manipulated by flapping creatures and protected by one who loses herself, we've had our own times when we were ignored because we're children, we were hurt by those we love and we felts all was against us.<br /><br />For full review: [...]
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very useful. I highly recommend it. Works well on a kindle fire and almost never force closes. It's very easy to check the battery on your kindle fire.
B00594XOZU|3.0|its not letting me download it on my kindle fire! I like it ingeneral but its not letting me download it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like this app a lot. It's one of the more addicting games I have. Just when I'm ready to give up, I find another item that gets me a little further.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Can be addicting, it's challenging but simple. My whole family plays this game even on our phone. you basically just race
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I just like to play Bingo and it is easy, fun and fast.  I would recommend it to every one.<br />While I enjoy playing Bingo Blitz it can be very frustrating when it freezes and your credits are not given back. It seems that the more popular this game becomes the more it freezes. I still enjoy playing though.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I received the product early, which was great. The 3D was incredible and the sound was great in 5.1 I can't understand people complaining about the sound, but then I have a Bose system. My only complaint is paying too much for what I wanted. I wanted the movie in 3D, Why do I have to pay for a Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + Ultraviolet. Drop the price on just the 3D version  and I can afford to buy more movies in 3D. I don't need or want the rest.<br /><br />Al
B00847TKSE|2.0|I remember this event from the late 1980's. News coverage from the time was more interestingly done  than this movie. The screenplay was exceedingly flat and predictable. Good actors wasted on a dud!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I did read some of the reviews,and was pleasantly surprised at how challenging this game is. I love it . One of the best games I have downloaded yet.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great trilogy sad to see it end. Christian bale will NOT come back as batman for the upcoming justice league movie so this is it!  I got the blu ray trilogy for my man on Christmas. All in all fantastic movies.
B00BCOL5YS|3.0|They say they went back to the original master tapes. But somehow they forgot to bring back the bass, so the music sounds thin and insubstantial. You blew it Universal.<br /><br />Dunno why, but every 2013 box set I've bought so far has had poor remastering: this includes the Stranglers, Donovan, and this one. Why can't these labels give a damn when they re-release music? Why do the artists let them ruin their legacy?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What more can I say.  Great story line, and excellent cast.  Keeps you wanting more!  Be afraid, very, very afraid!
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Not only does it work with the Ouya, but it's the smoothest game I've seen on the Ouya yet! Deliver moonshine, make money buying and selling goods between runs, outrun police, take alternate paths and blast through all types of obstacles. Nice splash effects -- has a Wave Racer feel to it! Overall, a fun diversion, but don't expect anything with plenty of depth.
B006TLFPKO|1.0|First I have to ask, did they change directors for this movie? The best part was the gorgeous scenery. I love Washington state. Other than that - the writing was really bad. It certainly kept conversation to a minimum. Someone mentioned alot of padding. Yes. With music taking up what should have been a plot and dialog. I was reminded again of Kristen's monotone acting and mumbling. Not much of a range. The last movie or two (not the first!) I was thinking she was getting better but there was a backslide in this one. There was a pause after ev-er-y comment. Every last one. The reason I thought the director had been changed out. I don't remember it being like that in the last 2 movies. But again, the scenery was spectacular.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Worth the play, though for the length of the game $.99 rather than $1.99 would make it worth the cost of purchasing it too.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I started reading this book with the expectation that if I didn't like it, I would simply set it down.  Just the opposite happened, I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  Before the week-end was over, I have read the next five books in this series.  It is a well written story; the characters are well developed, there are just enough characters and sub plots to keep things interesting.  I am confident you will enjoy this book and be hooked on the series.  I can't wait until book #7 comes out in August.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I wish their were more games like it it is the best game so far it is so life like and lots of fun
B00BHMF578|1.0|Every other word was the &#34;F&#34; word, totally unnecessary, and distracted from the plot.  Knowing the outcome didn't help.  Lot of noise, shouting, didn't like Ben Affleck in this role.
B000W4D94I|4.0|Many blu-ray releases at least offer a Spanish audio track! And even better, many come in German and Japanese, which I study. But not even Spanish? That's ridiculous!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|As DM fan for 20 plus years, i am happy with this album, I can sing along again and now it's new tunes:)
B005HSL626|2.0|So if I was only reviewing it based on the actual game and not the permissions it would be a ★★★★★ but it has some really creepy permissions and I just really think some of them are very unessential.  For instance, why dose it need to see my contacts and have acess to my camera? also on the privacy policy they said they 'may' monitor 3rd party applications and all sorts pf other creepy stuff. to make it worse on the privacy policy they never promise they wont give out your information.
B0087ITBPC|4.0|It was light hearted, and the story-line was easy to follow. I really enjoyed it.  I have already recommended it to several of my friends as a must-see.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|I have always like Alcott's work...such precious characters and charming literary strategies such as personification.  There really are no writers like her anymore...too bad.  There is a lot of love spread around in every one of her works.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|Works well on Kindle Fire, but many-colored choice is not helpful.  However, regular puzzles available with one color much clearer to use.  So a very good download with no obvious problems.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Love it. I really like how the Colorado grow and when I tried it it was the best coloring app ever
0425263924|5.0|Great series wish I didn't have to wait for the next book, did not like being left hanging like that!
B000002KDM|5.0|I love the song about the feds stuck him in a hole in Leavenworth Prison where he lived until his dying day. The guy who wrote that song played guitar in James Taylor's band and they played well on some video I saw lately. There is a duet video with Carly Simon singing You Can Close Your Eyes that is great music for the kind of people who like the songs on Mud Slide Slim and The Blue Horizon. I like hearing in 2013 what impressed me like Hey Mister That's Me Up On The Jukebox, which seemed perfect to me the first time I heard it. I'm the one: singing this sad song. The logic floors me.
B000002GVO|5.0|The Eagles always write great music and lyrics that are intelligent and thought-provoking! Just a great assembly of talent! This is the best of their outstanding body of work!
B002QUWYWE|5.0|Some parts of the film with the sound of tires going threw the snow and the amazing shots depicting life in a small town in the mountains, made me feel like I was there.<br /><br />I was hoping Annie would only wound the sheriff, and not blow a hole through his heart...that was a little disturbing.<br /><br />Makes one wonder how many Annie's are lurking in secluded places out of sight, ticking like a time bomb, waiting for just the right circumstance to explode.<br /><br />The actors were magnificent.  How does one know when someone's persona is just an act.  Makes me wonder about Ronald Reagan and Arnold.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Boo's all cute n s***. But Randall's a dick. Yeah, twas funny. Also better than Monster's University. Although that might not mean much.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Mark of Athena was the best book ever.I have read all the rick riordan. Book and this is one of my favorit kind. I really want to read house of Hades.
0679805273|5.0|Been a Dr. Seuss fan since the 1950's when I read the books to my sisters.  Still love reading them today but now read them to my 65 yr old husband!  We can both relate to Dr. Seuss as he is inspirational in his words and his artwork so we sleep like babies as his books de-stress us too!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|5 stars! a great book with all of the perfect elements. I couldn't put it down! Anyone who likes Divergent, or other distopien novels will love The Hunger Games
B00CLD65X0|5.0|One of the best shows I have ever seen. Each episode is better than the last one. A must see! Two thumbs way up.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Wow! A great read. It keeps you guessing right up to the end. Great storyline. Brilliant work as always John.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I play this game when really board. My 4 year old daughter will also play it. It's one of a few that she cycles through while waiting for our food at the restaurant or some other place we are waiting.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|I really bated this app because it mist wasn't exciting enough. I would like it better if the app was way better.
B00D8WMASM|5.0|GREAT ASS ALBUM A MUST HAVE. I loved every bit of it you gonna love it its a treat to have
B006GWO5NE|3.0|This product led me to believe I was getting a USB cord with a plug for the wall outlet. It did not state otherwise. Luckily I had my original USB to wall outlet converter. It should have been more clear.
B009Z59ZNE|4.0|A great series and an excellent prequel to the US version of House of Cards with Kevin Spacey in the lead .
B007VCMGPM|4.0|I would say 75% of the songs on this album are awesome. Too many times you buy an album and there are only a few good songs on it. John 5 doesn't disappoint on this album. Very good stuff.
B00B22IJXK|3.0|It's an entertaining app for my 4 year old when I need a distraction. This is one of many apps we cycle through while waiting at the restaurant for our food. You know how four year olds are, if I get 5 minutes out of it, it is a success.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|It is a great love story that has comedy in it too.  Perfect combination for a movie.  Lighthearted and funny.
1419701533|5.0|Definitely a great present, this collection is made to last for years.<br />The hard box and hard cover of each book make it much better to last.
B006Z7Z3S6|2.0|This movie really stunk.  It is the kind of movie you give to someone in their christmas stocking, instead of coal.  Oh well
0062278592|5.0|A while ago, I read an article by a scientifically-minded academic who argued that we should stop reading our children fairy tales. He thought that the tales tend to be too escapist, encouraging a belief in children that the real world is not beautiful enough, is not good enough, is not full of enough wonder. Only fairy tale lands have beauty, goodness, and wonder. It seemed to me then that the author absolutely misunderstood the point of fairy tales, had overlooked entirely the work of Marie von Franz, Carl Jung, and countless others, who argue vehemently and beautifully that the power of fairy tales do not come from some form of escapism, but from just how deeply those tales are connected to our real world. In essence, the world of fairy tales *is* our world.<br /><br />And that is a truth we forget so easily as we age. The world loses its wonder. Possibility fades into probability. We see trees for trees instead of trees for masts. We stop searching for pictures in the clouds. We fall into our patriarchal, social lines, act out our dues, define ourselves by objectivity, and condemn our subjective being. Neil Gaiman's \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" is two things to me. 1) It is a beautifully crafted argument, portrayal, of what we lose when we leave behind that sense of creative, imaginative, unbounded wonder. In fact, it is this very distinction that creates the tension between the good and evil forces of the novel. 2) It is a serious coming-of-age tale in which a 7-year-old boy experiences two violent deaths, with which he must wrestle and come to terms. The fairy tale in the novel is not only happening to the boy, but happening within the boy. And here's the beauty of the story: we are not sure that he succeeds. We are not sure that he retains the unbounded wonder at the end of the novel. We are not sure that he has forgotten adulthood, and embraced his inner child. Instead we are given the most perfect ending possible for this novel: remnants of both the full moon and quarter moon, both the darkness and the pure wonder and creativity and knowledge, hanging just over his shoulder forever.<br /><br />This is a novel that will move you if and only if you let it move you. If you are an adult who can remember what it is like to look at the clouds and ask questions, this book will read more like an autobiography for you than a novel. It is beautifully written, so well-crafted. I have read every one of Gaiman's novels, and loved each one for different reasons. But this novel is without question my most favorite. This is the closest to pure literature that we will ever see from Gaiman. I almost don't want him to write another novel because I'm afraid I should be disappointed.
B004EJUMT2|5.0|Can't shake the song, &#34;Ritual.&#34; (This chapel of ritual Smells of dead human sacrifices From the altar bed On this night of ritual...) Remarkably catchy number from Sweden's finest since ABBA.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Sold an iPad and sent the wrong cord to the customer. I'd just purchased a ton of books on my Kindle Fire and it died after my vacation. Needed to find an affordable replacement cord. Perfect!
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|We got this for him, its seriously a guys film and loud, bloody and action packed. Just what guys want.... Right?
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Best of the Best, keeps you glued to your seat, like you were there riding with the MC, highly recommend!
030758836X|2.0|I read this book for my book club pick and did not like. There is nothing more to the book other than the disappearance story, which can get old and boring for an over four hundred page book, adding to that, none of the characters are likable. It was difficult for me to finish the book, I probably would not done if I would have chose it my self, and to make the book worst it does not even have an ending. I don't recommend this book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game, wonderful graphics and challenging without being impossible to solve.  I look forward to them creating another one soon. Great job!
B00C061I3K|4.0|It's possible I'm biased, but I really like the direction Daft Punk took on this album.  There are a few tracks that I will skip through, but those are few, maybe 2, 3 at the most.  There are guest artists on the cd which is probably why it varies in styles.  First time I listened to it I knew there were 2 tracks I liked, then 4, then 6…etc...
143353083X|4.0|It is a great Bible for studying and reading. I have had no problems with it or any typos. The only thing I wish it had would be red lettering to denote the things Jesus said.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|My husband had to have this for his collection. He loves his movies and this he didn't have in his collection
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|one would think that a match 3 game crossed with an rpg would not mix well and they are what I would like to call wrong. this game is crazy addictive and works flawlessly and best of all it requires zero unsafe permissions. I got it free as a free app of the day and would have gladly payed for this app.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I've always wanted to learn to play magic.  The tutorials in the free demo were amazing.  In short, bought the full version and my fiance did as well.  We bought magic cards and have been playing each other after dinner each night.  Great investment and tons of content.  A great pickup for my kindle fire.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|These are  the songs that didn't make the albums. A lot of them are played live, and that's how the crowd knows the songs.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Not as good as the two previous.  Like so many others, I had pre-ordered this book and was excited to get it when it was finally released.  It was not the quality of the previous books and the ending was such a big let down.  Then to find out that Ms. Day had sold the series as a trilogy originally, only now to find out that it has been a five book series instead.  Unless I change my mind, I will not be ordering the other two books.  Sorry to Ms. Day, but I feel she let a lot of her readers down.
B00003CXCD|5.0|Absolutely adore this movie! It arrived in perfect shape and now my mom and I can add it to our collection of TCM movies
B00338QENI|5.0|This is a great read. Just goes to show you personal information gathering is not something that started with the digital age.
0062224050|5.0|Prayers for Rain by Dennis Lehane. Want to read a fast action novel? Want to try a figure out who's who? Is this some sort of a mad man's game? This is the book for you. Do you remember such books as the Maltese Falcon? If you have read them then you are in for a treat! When I finished reading Prayers for Rain, I could see this great book as a movie starring Humphrey Bogart as Patrick Kenzie and Lauren Bacall as Angela Gennaro. It begins with a young lady, Karen Nichols, who contacts Kenzie about a man who will not leave her alone, Cody Falk. Karen tells of Cody watching her while she works out and has followed her making remarks about her body and how he would like to enjoy her. Bubba, Kenzie buddy since childhood, is willing to do anything, even murder if needed. Karen dies under circumstances that have Kenzie wondering why? His investigation digs so deep that he is now threated by a mad man, Wesley Dawes. Or is it Wesley? Dr. Christopher Dawes and his wife, what secrets do they hold? This mystery about Wesley, how deep does it go? And just who is Scott Pearce? There are so many questions in this story. When the killing ends, is it the end? Get this book and find out for yourself!<br />PD
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I liked that it was easy to read. Disliked that it was a little too easy. This book would be good for fans of Speak by Laurie Halse Andersen
B00C8985DU|5.0|First rate treatment of the best live album of Mecca's career. Been waiting for this as soon as I knew all Wings music would be released. This is really worth the price. If you weren't there for 1976, you will feel you were there after going thru all four pieces. Beyond what most deluxe box sets usually contain.

B00BGIC2J2|3.0|A few hilarious gags and is frighteningly true but overall still seemed a little disjointed.  Also I understand all kinds of F-bombs in a dark cop movie but it seemed overdone in this one.<br />Worth watching but don't have too high of expectations.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so much fun it is like I actually have horse.  it is so adicting. really good game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loved this game a lot.  Just hard enough!  Can't wait for the next installment,  Please make it happen sooner.  Thank you.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Sarcastic, funny and sexy! I couldn't put the book down after I got through the first few chapters. Must read!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|A cute girly game that occupies my daughter while we are waiting at various appointments. So many dress options that it does not get boring.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|After reading the book, I didn't think the movie would be as good since the book was short of amazing.  Surprisingly, the movie was spot on.  Loved it.  Knew the ending and still cried, even after watching it three times.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This is a good ending to this wonderful series based on the books, it had some surprises in it  if you are like me and have not read the books yet.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I have been unable to play candy crush on my kindle. This is a very close second and so far very fast paced .enjoyable!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Replacement of the original equipment.  Received the package on timely manner.  Quite pricey for something that will be obsolete soon as the new console will be shipping soon.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Nicholas Sparks such an amazing author. I fell in love with his writing after reading this book
0307476073|4.0|I found this a close second to Roz Savage's &#34;Rowing the Atlantic&#34; -- both are moving tales of women who set out to accomplish amazing physical feats, to overcome emotional challenges. Cheryl's tale of her trek on some of the Pacific Crest Trail are riveting reads -- you keep wondering if bad will befall her as a solo female hiker, and appreciating all the goodness she encounters. The book also gave me a great appreciation for the vastness of food and shelter that many of us take for granted ... so hard to imagine getting through the week with only 60 cents in her pocket, but Cheryl did on the trail. Quite worth the read, just be sure to read &#34;Rowing the Atlantic&#34; too if you're a woman on a quest of your own!
B00DBSZ6ZC|3.0|There was a lot of action and the story line was creative.  Great side effects, although a bit gory.  Casting was well done.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was so much fun for me and my son. Can't wait until they develop more levels to the game.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|Great actors and great performances; beautiful, weird, and fantastic sets; script revision respectful to the original; all and all a worthy staging of this Shakespearean classic. My only quibble is the staging of the marriage scene. While the universe and mathematical images were breathtaking, some gods and goddesses would've been more fun. Definitely worth watching.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|All 4 movies packaged together with a few extra features plus a great &#34;one day sale&#34; made this too good to pass up.  Who doesn't like Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones?  :)  Great packaging (that actually seems to be holding together, unlike others we've purchased) and high quality.  These family favorites will be watched many many times.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|The graphics are great but needs more guns seriously no colt 1911 and no m1 bazooka but still good but there were no flash hiders
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|This album trumps everything the band has done since Empire (yes, that includes Promised Land). The ousting of Geoff Tate and the addition of Todd La Torre has really infused the band with a great new creative energy and it is bursting from almost every track on this record. In their heyday, there wasn't a single song on a Queensryche album that I wanted to skip. While there are a couple of tracks on this one that I might be tempted to skip over (Redemption, In This Light), it's mainly because the song that follows is so good. Pay no attention to the peanut gallery, running down this record because they are the Geoff Tate faithful and cannot stomach the idea that this band can be successful (musically or otherwise) without him in it. Lyrically, this album is the equal of anything Tate ever wrote and musically, it crushes almost two decades' worth of the band's output.<br /><br />I was going to give it four stars, simply for the fact that there are a couple of tracks that I'm lukewarm on...but when you compare it to everything since Empire, it deserves five stars for what it represents. Welcome back, Queensryche...and go get 'em, Todd.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I am enjoying playing manning on my kindle Fire. It gives me something to do while waiting. It is a fast paced game.
B00BY1F8UQ|5.0|This Keith Jarret concert, accompanied by very competent musicians, was a most appreciated acquisition to listen jazz calmily.and inn the house relaxed.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I've enjoyed hours of play time. Graphics are crisp. Tile designs are elegant. Backgrounds add variety. Highly recommend this free game.
B009YQJ322|3.0|For a super hero movie, it fell behind a lot on super hero elements, Spiderman shoot web, Batman do things in dark, Superman has super strength, so there are a bunch of examples down the road.<br /><br />Dredd, besides holding his equipments from his unit, he's just an old fashion cop practicing law, and that's all about it. There is nothing 'super' about him, one might say 'hey, Batman doesn't has super power either', but to me his nearly unbelievable fortune that back him doing what he's doing is the 'super power', by the definition that super power meaning a power source that is unreal, and in his case, his financial and technological support is unreal.<br /><br />This Dredd, however, too 'real' as a super hero, besides he's living in a near future environment, he's just a cop. I repeatedly point out that because aside the futurisctic setup in this movie, the plot and everything else is just so standard production to the best. I can't even count how many times I've seen an action movie with the main bad 'guy' is a drug lord of some kind.<br /><br />The movie is still interested to the end, I don't deny that, but it falls to those movie title that you would rewatch after a certain while. Clearly a few months past there is nothing in this movie that I would recall like the other super hero would.<br /><br />[...]
B002M87V0A|5.0|Wonderful music, compelling story, a real gem.  I bought it on Bluray and am very sastisfied.  A must have for any collkection.

B0006IUDXA|5.0|Indescribable! Given any situation MacGyver has a way out and a solution. Present day movies do not have the quality of yesteryear productions!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|A little too slow at the beginning. Far too many repetitions of the same idea. I am not liking this as much as other PC books.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am impressed!  This app works seamlessly with my Kindle/  It downloaded with lightning speed and it works like a dream.
1451695195|1.0|I have a hard time believing anything this guy wrote now that his credentials have been questioned. He had has had multiple malpractice suits against him according to a recent article in Esquire. As a result, the doctor has had to jump around from hospital to hospital after being terminated for botching surgeries. The doctor that was treating him in the ER when his meningitis occurred, Dr. Potter, denies the way the events took place in his book and says he was forced to be sedated. Eben's vision of the afterlife sounds like a pipe dream high from smoking the bong. This doctor had a $3 million malpractice lawsuit filed against him right before the incident occurred for wrongful surgery and for trying to hide evidence of it. He is nothing but a liar, and I regret reading this book by a liar. The article in Esquire says it all. If you like reading feel-good-made-up-fiction, then this book is for you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love can you escape it is like a brain games, but it is not easy and not too hard. This game is wonderful for people who like a challenge. The levels get harder as you go on, but still fun. Sometimes the game makes me mad and I can't figure it out, but just take a break from it.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|One of the best thermal compounds out there.  Has a long cure time, but have been using this same kind for nearly every computer ever built and never had an issue with this product.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Whether you are an official decision-maker or just an average person this book is an absolute must for succeeding in all areas of life. Fascinating and also deeply \\"disturbing\\" (for anyone who thinks they know how to think).
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Keeps telling me to install new version and only lets me try to open the game. So the game won.t load keeps looping
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This app works well on my kindle as well as my Android!  If you want to keep up to date with your Twitter account download this app.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Loved this read.  Many of us have the odd friend like the main character - although probably not so extreme.  I really enjoyed the main character.  He has autism - and although a work of fiction, it was an interesting insight into the mind of someone who takes many things literally, and lives with complete structure.  It had some LOL moments, and I was sad when it ended.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Loved the book. It is so good to hear about people turning their lives around and doing God's work. Absolutely loved it.<br />Recommended the book to everyone.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Josh Duhamel always delivers...The acting was pretty good. Story was believable. Simple romance. Somewhat predictable but I really liked it!

B00BHHIWQO|2.0|For some reason that I don't understand, this app will not work properly on my Kindle Fire.  I uninstalled it and reinstalled it three times, it just doesn't work.  Works fine on my android
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it because I have no troubles with the app so far and some of the games are hard to pass so it's not to easy
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was reluctant to get a social network account, but I'm glad I got Pinterest. It is now my personal space &amp; organizer.
1623420148|5.0|This is my favorite book now. It's not nearly long enough, but that's also what makes it so great; leaves you wanting more. It's simple and understated and original. Drew is one to love! He will knock your socks off, and your panties too! It's really creative and fun and feels genuinely written by a man, so way to go Emma! Love it.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is fun and interesting! The difficulty level is extremely easy to understand. Making it more available and accessible for all ages! Warning. Not always accurate when it comes to reality levels and commonsense.
0679805273|5.0|Love the fun way dr Seuss shares the journey.  I have ordered a copy for each of my children and plan to have their teachers write a little note each year.  Starting in preschool thru high school.  I plan to give it as part of their graduation present as a keepsake.
B002APU580|5.0|I have enjoyed all the versions but like this one the very best.  It follows the book and it's characters are done so well by the actors.
006220629X|3.0|I felt very let down after reading this, it does not reach a conclusion and merely sets you up for a sequel.  It is exceptionally well written, as you would expect and it takes you halfway there in style!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Purchased for my Bride's Kindle reading enjoyment.  Nicholas Sparks is one of her favorite authors and the purchase of Kindle offerings is quick and easy.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton make perfect siblings... so real to life... Love this movie as well. It is Great!
B007REV4YI|1.0|This is the worst Bond movie.  No plot, no gadgets, no women, no cool stunts, lame action scenes,  Oh yeah, the most improbable story sequences possible.  Was it about- the most important list(which was forgotten)-M getting old-Bond being an orphan(how Disneyesque)-Really!!!????-this is not what you expect from a Bond movie. (and we are Bond fans!)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's a bit strange when you first start it because it's written all in the form of letters from the main character's perspective. But keep reading, the book itself is fantastic, with a really ...(good?) ending. It is sad but very uplifting at the same time. My new favorite book!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Very happy with this charger. I can charge 2 apple products at the same time, and charging times are rapid.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is so much fun I play it all the time and enjoy every second. But it would be nice if extra land was cheaper.Also I bought another piece. Of land on the corner but I can only see a corner of it.
B00004WNE4|5.0|What a turn from Rod Argent, Colin Blunstone and the guys.  A classsic psychadelic era masterpiece.  This one shouldn't be missed!!

0739341243|5.0|Cain does a commendable job integrating research into her narrative. I'm a bit of an introvert and learned a lot about myself.
0439023513|5.0|This is an incredible ending to one of the most important book series in this century.  Throughout the entire series, Katniss has been trying to figure out the world.  At first, she thinks all the people in the Capitol must be awful and heartless for cheering at the Hunger Games.  But there's Cinna and the prep team.  And throughout, people around her hide what is really going on.  There is only one tv channel and it only shows what the Capitol wants.  The mayor watches a different channel.  Haymitch and Peeta hide the star-crossed lovers stategy from her. Haymitch hides the existence of District 13 even she asks him about it.  The co-victors hide the fact that they are part of the rebel plot.  Gale, Plutarch and the others hide the existence of Peeta's interview from Katniss.  President Coin hides her plot to get rid of Katniss, but Boggs knows and is angry.  Slowly, Katniss has been putting all the pieces together.  And at the end, the writer invites you, the reader to put all the pieces together with Katniss.  The only problem is, you have to know to look.  You also have to know how to think critically.  Some readers will fail and hate the ending.  But those who figure it out are richly rewarded with an important lesson.  Before reading the spoilers below, please read page 370 and try to figure out why Katniss says, \\"This is the moment.\\"  How does she signal to Haymitch and how does Haymitch signal to Katniss?<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />SPOILERS<br />SPOILERS<br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Give up?  Here is the real ending of Chapter 26 of Mockingjay.  Haymitch gets Coin to reveal her true colors.  With this info, Katniss decides to kill Coin and Haymitch secretly signals to Katniss his support.<br /><br />1) \\"Was this Plutarch's idea?\\" - Haymitch says this to trick President Coin into admitting it was her idea to continue the Hunger Games with the Capitol's children. Coin reveals how ruthless she really is.<br />2) \\"I vote yes... for Prim\\" - Katniss secretly signals toHaymitch that she has her own plan. Haymitch knows that the games goes against everything Prim stood for, so Katniss can't possibly mean she is voting for the games for Prim.  She is saying something else entirely. Katniss is fulfilling her original promise to Prim, to win the games, where the arena is her life, all their lives.<br />3) \\"I'm with the Mockingjay\\" -Haymitch secretly signals to Katniss that he understands and supports her plan. He says \\"Mockingjay\\" to signal that he understands she is fighting in the Mockingjay role once more even though the Capitol has been defeated for some time.<br /><br />As for the ending after this scene, it's beautiful and real.  Katniss never let herself indulge in romantic love.  Even when she feels Gale insulted her by insinuating that she was so heartless she'd choose the man she needed to survive, she brushes that aside because she doesn't have time for it.  But in the end, she has the love she deserves.  Katniss and Peeta decide to stay together, no matter what.  It's not romantic exactly, but unlike the illusion of romance, it is for always.<br /><br />Thank you Suzanne Collins for teaching a new generation the importance of thinking critically about the world around them in order to fight the good fight.  This book is a great honor to Ms. Collins' father, a war veteran who taught her to see the truth around her.  He would be very proud if he were alive today.
B000FC10HA|5.0|I don't know anything about marketing. Or I should say I didn't know anything about marketing. After reading this book I have a great foundational concept of the field and its objectives. Well worth your time if you are looking to understand the basics.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|This movie was a great introduction to Zack Snyder's Superman. Enjoyed every minute of it. I'll continue to support the DC movies that will continue to come out simply because I'd love to see how Warner Bros & DC will put together the Justice League when it comes time to create it. Keep supporting these films & we'll all get to see the best team of heroes come together.

159659201X|5.0|He's certainly self-absorbed, but his views on cognitive processes that fool us are interesting. His approach is more relevant to environments, like trading in financial instruments, where one is competing against other actors that are attempting to act rationally, but there are everyday lessons also. I bought the audio version for use in my car and I'm listening to it for the second time.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Wow!  Once again Khalid Hosseini delivers a story that draws you in and keeps you up nights!  I love these characters and I'm planning on retreading this amazing story while on vacation this summer!  Please don't keep us waiting too long for your next book!

B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I saw Pitch Perfect in theaters and couldn't wait until it came out to DVD to get it. I love the blu ray and the special features were really cute. I love when comedies put in deleted scenes/outtakes/extras. They are normally the best.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Lightening fast, super fun game.  Sometimes I find myself holding my breath and then when I realize it I start laughing.  I love the fact that I can play against my daughter and we have so much fun together.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's Pinterest! I absolutely love how user friendly this app is. It's just amazingly simple to navigate. A must have for all Pinterest addicts.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. It really gets your brain working! I can not wait for the new levels to be ready. Very addicting!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I always look for games that challenge me and that is exactly what this app does. The only thing bad about it is that it only has 10 levels

B0059WTMLW|4.0|Nice and easy to use. We like that it keep track of all your numbers and letters, then automatically removes them when you finish a square
B000BW7QX6|5.0|Must have movie for all the Brown Coats out there.  Get this and the series for what amounts to a song on amazon.
B008CPAVZO|3.0|I have to say the Exit Humanity was a fresh take on a genere that I believe is played out. The western flavor and the main protagonist plight makes you actually care. The western setting gives you a little more dire feeling and if you are a gamer and played Red Dead Redemption Zombies it's very reminiscent.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game is great any one that say's its not is wrong its a great game it passes the time well but you neer wifi so thats the only bad thing
1455508977|5.0|Wonderful book. Read it fast because it is so good. Love Nicholas Sparks! Get it and read it. The end
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|If you enjoyed the movie, you will love it in 3D. For the price I paid (under $20), I got a 3D blu-ray, a regular blu-ray, a DVD, and a digital copy of the movie. I gave the DVD away but still enjoy the blu-rays, especially the 3D version on my 3D TV. Great movie package at a great price.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It grabbed my attention right from the start and I loved the twists and turns.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A must have for all the &#34;Brown Coats&#34; out there.  The best show ever to be cancelled in it's first season.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|This is not Die Hard. The could have called this moving a hundred different names but one thing it was not was Die Hard. I'm so tired of companies trying to milk a golden calf by slapping the name of a successful franchise on a obviously different movie. So if you wanted it in the same world so what you can have John McClain but the action and pacing was all wrong for a Die Hard movie save for the gratuitous killing of the final boss. For shame I might have liked the move better under a different name.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|ya it can get boring but after you get a whole of games it is so much fun! you should by this game the best thing about it is that it is free!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Can't live without this keyboard!  This thing corrects everything I throw at it. The swipe could use some improvement but peck typing is impeccable!
B006SVHOL8|4.0|I watched the movie by streaming it to my television. Outside of liking the movie, I liked how easy it was to order from Amazon and how well the movie displayed over the internet. For anyone wondering if online streaming is worth the money, I'd say that you must consider the technology you own (internet speed, television) before making the purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so fun. You could get coins. You have friends. You could Chhose Chhosea character you want to run with. It is addicting. You have to get this game. The best part is that it's FREE!!!!!
B0079TQHDO|5.0|Since reading the first novel from this trilogy, Only Time Will Tell,  I could hardly wait to get my hands on The Sins of the Father and it hasn't disappointed.  I now can't wait for the next installment.  Thank you Jeffrey!!
B0059WTMLW|2.0|Got it as free app of the day. Would have rated it even lower if I had paid.  There are MANY other freebie versions of Sudoku that are soooo much better in execution.
B0081336FO|5.0|Season 2 was even better than season 1 and the season finale leaves you on the edge of your seat. Thoroughly love this show. Can't wait until the next season begins.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I play this game daily.  It is very fun.  My only complaint is not having enough daily credits and I've had trouble receiving free credits from my friends FB page when you share an accomplishment.  You also use to get 9 power ups for $1000 coins and now you get 4.  Big difference.  But the game itself is fun and addictive.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|There were no issues with playback. The audio quality was also good. This was my first time using amazon's instant streaming.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|it kept shutting down my kindle while in use,  after a virus, malware, and spyware scan had a report of bad or harmful adds to the device.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun. It's easier then temple run because you don't have to tilt your tablet or phone. You move lanes by swiping! I think that's easier then any other RUN games. Get this game. Recommend. Totally.  It's hard to stop. I'm still trying to get the out people other then Jake. So fun!!!!!!!!!!
1593272774|4.0|nice ideas the book is greta but needs some more information I think. I bought them my son looked at them once and there sitting around now. waste of my money as usually
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing. This book really moved me and made me look at the world in a whole new way. I feel that by reading this book, readers will gain a whole new perspective on the world around them, and see just how impacting each and every action they make really is. Readers may also learn a lot about themselves after reading this book. It really makes you think about how important your life here is, and what kind of legacy you want to leave behind. Everyone will leave a footprint, some larger than others. But how important is it, really, to leave behind a big footprint? Why not live presently, and absorb everything the universe has to offer? I recommend this book to practically everyone I speak to, and I recommend it to you reading this now.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app brings back wonderful memories of playing free room escape games on the internet. Tidy graphics and short but sweet puzzles make this a winner for me. The puzzles might seem overly easy at first but they steadily get more complicated, don't worry :)
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|It's just a great little game! It has a direction to go for .  Plenty of activities to hold your interest. Thanks for the game!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the next level there is something new every know and then there is also a lot of challenges to be done
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Just what we've come to expect from Josh Groban. Wonderful song choices and a voice that more than does justice to each one.
1593272790|4.0|nice ideas the book is greta but needs some more information I think. I bought them my son looked at them once and there sitting around now. waste of my money as usually
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Me<br /><br />What in the world is this crap I do not have time for this ridiculous junk that is all
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I've had a lot of fun playing this ap and getting to the next rooms. It does require some brainpower, but that's what makes it so fun!
B004WMKXWM|5.0|Moves a bit slow in parts, but so did the Book.  This movie really sets up DH part 2 well.
B009ZE27US|1.0|This is a stupid app that barely works so don't wast your time on this. It only works on the test drive .
0553582038|5.0|I purchased this book used and it has a few markings but otherwise is in good shape. It arrived quickly and I'm enjoying the saga.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I wanted to see this movie and I know that others either like it or hate it, but I enjoyed it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that this game is very fun.I personally like how you have to earn points.Although it can be annoying, it makes me want to play even more.
B007KQI1NA|4.0|I use this with Microsoft Autoroute Europe and Streets 'n Trips.  Seems to lock faster than the older 353 (to be used as a backup).
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love Spider, it is so addictive that I play it every evening before settling to bed and will play for 1-2 hours.
B0089XH38M|1.0|i downloaded the app to my kindle but was not able to use it on the kindle at all.  It was a waste
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|It's little bit scary but not gory. The story is good even though the ending is predictable. We loved it!
B004X2M3N8|5.0|... but Matt Smith had made me a believer by the end of season five.  Ten will always be my Doctor, but Eleven's whimsy and passion was wonderful and it made season six  quite enjoyable.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm enjoying reading this series. I have also read some of Day's others books. All her writing reads smooth and quick. Looking forward to the next installment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a fun game to play when you're bored. I recommend it for everyone, it is not only fun,  but free as well.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I beat all 10 levels in about 45 minutes. I really enjoyed the game but they either need to add more rooms or make them more difficult.
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|I thought the acting was first class and the story line was brilliant. I would certainly recommend this to m,y friends.
1616614609|5.0|i absolutely hate card games. Personally i think Magic the Gathering is one of the worst games conceived. Netrunner, however, i have grown to love. The mechanics and strategy are extremely well done. I highly recommend this game to -anyone-.<br /><br />now if only Fantasy Flight would offer a booster box that would round out the core set, so i dont have to buy 3 more core boxes to get 3 of all of the cards.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The book was a little slow paced but does a good job continuing from the other books. Can't wait for the next one.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Just had to have this to complete my kindle collection, I have enjoyed this series for years and want to get the rest soon.
1452105111|4.0|The letters are large and bright. There are plenty of letters in the set. Great for kids birthday parties. recommended.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I've had this app for about a week &amp; so far it hasn't given me any problems. I'm getting to the more advanced Flow boards &amp; it is a challenge. I think I spend way too much time playing. It's addicting.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved everything about it, this entire crossfire series as captivated my attention from the very start. I will eagerly await # 4
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Was not sure what to expect but this really held my attention.  Lots of potential for continued stories with this series.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil never misses. This book is full of heart, wonder. I'm just in awe. I feel so moved I have very few words.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging game that really makes you think.  Glad I got this game because I was tired of illogical games that gave you random wins.
B002SEQ8ZC|5.0|this was a purchase for my wife who LOVES this movie.  (so do i but, she's a little crazy about it.)  i loved the &#34;tunnel&#34; in the box.  well, i love most paper-craft and it was really neat to see it applied to movie packaging.  the cards were neat but i get those all the time in anime packaging so that wasn't anything new.  they just sit in the box looking pretty.  the book was pretty insightful.  i do love the extra snippets that you learn reading the &#34;add-ons&#34; in the gift sets.  i haven't had the luxury of reading the book so it was neat to learn how different the movie is.<br /><br />my favorite part of this set is the ANAGLYPH 3D version of the movie.  i really thought the 3D would require a 3D TV, something i feel just isn't there yet, technologically.  (where are the hologram TVs?!?  Japan, i'm looking at you!)  the 3D actually looks better than in the theater.<br /><br />we had this on DVD, lent it to someone and they returned it with Mystery Science Theater 3000 in it instead of Coraline.  (they don't remember borrowing it but i know it's their copy of MST3K.)  so we were left with a ton of anaglyph 3D glasses and no movie.  the pairs that came with the DVD also work for the Bluray.  BONUS!  now EIGHT people can crowd into our living and watch it in 3D!<br /><br />so... buy this for the box and the &#34;simple&#34; 3D.  this is the first Bluray Anaglyph 3D movie i've watched and it was fantastic.  (still takes a while for the color to balance out but, that's a brain thing.)
B008200LHW|5.0|I bought it for my wife and she absolutely loved using it with Microsoft Streets and Trips 2013. She enjoyed being able to use the larger screen of the laptop and this GPS picked up a signal extremely well (over twice as strong as the one included with Streets and Trips).
B00AW0KHMY|2.0|I ordered this extended edition on blu-ray May 2013. I watched the extended version at least 10 times and the disc froze in the exact same place every time (scene where Jacob is trying to convince Bella not to go through with having the baby). I ended up replacing the disc, but the new disc did the exact same thing. This time I returned it and ordered Part I and II together.
B00723NWJE|5.0|I never feel cheated when I purchase a Norah Jones album because each and every piece is invariably beautifully constructed. Clearly, she received a gift for composition and clarity from her illustrious father which she took to another level (in collaboration with Danger Mouse) in Little Broken Hearts.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|as my title say i got this for a low cost budget build (gaming/multimedia). I am running the AMDFX-8350 with no problem. I also have a Seagate Barracuda 3 TB HDD SATA 6 Gb/s NCQ 64MB Cache 7200 RPM 3.5-Inch running on it thanks to the dual bios on this MOBO i was able to load my windows 7 OS on to it thanks to the seagate disk wizard.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I missed a few or more than a few episodes before it went off the air.  As a Voyager van, this catches me up and gives me my Voyager fix.  Sadly,  I did wish it had a better ending.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I enjoy it.  Are there only 3 episodes in Season 1???  I was searching for Episode 4 but couldn't find it.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again! Has a certain reality element to it!
B000Q67876|5.0|I have been a big fan of this great classic! The fact that this classic has been released and remastered on Blu-ray its priceless! two thumps up!!
B008OOYALE|1.0|I downloaded this for my daughter to play and she managed to accidentally purchase $5.00 items in this game which were auto charged to my credit card. These types of games are geared towards having young children spend their parents money unknowingly.
B006YTTVHO|2.0|I hope know one is taking this as the ultimate on what to say.<br />I speed read this one for a friend.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|As of July 2 @ 10:14 am, it is still downloading. you sent me this message on June 30 to rate, all I can say is TERRIBLE!!!!!
B004S5FW1U|5.0|This is a beautiful book. I love the characters and all their vulnerabilities. Matthew Quick has approached the topic of mental health with such respect and even optimism which is so rare.
B000W4D94I|5.0|For those that like great suspense thriller movies with great visual effects this movie will take you on that ride! This tornadoes look so realistic! Such a great movie... I am Glad to see this movie on blu-ray!
0307887448|4.0|I saw this novel sitting on the top shelf of a Barnes & Noble and was immediately drawn to it because of it's title and and cover design.  After reading the synopsis on the back and all the stellar reviews plastered over the book, I checked Amazon to see what the readers gave it.  With over 1000 reviewers averaging to 4.5 stars, I bought it.<br /><br />The premise of this book, a massive competition to find Halliday's Easter Egg, wasn't entirely unique and did remind me of Willy Wonka.  However, setting the novel several years into the future and placing it almost entirely within a virtual reality really made up for that.  I found it fascinating that almost the entire human race abandoned the depressive and harsh monotony of reality for the much more exciting OASIS.  Also, having extensively studied addiction to MMORPGs through school, I thought the book said a lot about the harrowing and ever-present danger of engaging in virtual reality on a daily basis; it was illuminating, whether the author intended it to be or not.  The contest itself was exciting and kept me interested, with a few cliff-hangers thrown in throughout.  I liked the 80s pop culture references.  Having grown up in the 90s I was afraid most of the references would go over my head and take away from the story, but that was not an issue at all.  Most of the characters were likable and distinct and I easily immersed myself into their world for hours at a time.<br /><br />There were some negatives that have already been mentioned by other reviewers but I will state to round out my review.  First, the writing style is a little rough and I found myself metaphorically wincing at times because it just sounded bad.  The author has great potential and I think the more he writes the more he will improve.  Whenever the character explained things, such as the references or plans he created, it was almost too didactic and in-your-face; those passages could have been handled more creatively and written more smoothly.  I also felt that the narrator was just \\"too lucky.\\"  If there was an obstacle, no problem: the narrator already had a too-convenient solution and so the problem was cleared with no angst or tension at all.  In fact, the narrator's personality was the only one I didn't like; though overall he was okay, at times he came across as arrogant and cocky, and it was these instances that didn't win him over.  Also, one review that stuck out to me was on the back-cover stating this book was the \\"grown-up's Harry Potter.\\"  As a huge Harry Potter/J.K. Rowling fan (I'm talking an admiration probably comparable to the narrator's obsession with the 80s and Halliday), I cannot disagree with this quote more.  With no offense to Cline, the writing style, characterization, plot development, and overall structure is nothing compared to Rowling, who is a literary genius.  I kind of found the quote an insult to Rowling's writing.  Not to mention Harry Potter is for all ages.  Those who are huge HP fans should therefore not rely to heavily on this comparison.<br /><br />That aside, I still found this book enjoyable, enthralling, and unique.  I think it's a great debut novel and recommend it to gamers, 80s pop culture fans, and everyone who is looking for the next thing to add to their library.

B002HFP0QU|5.0|Great collection and I had forgotten some of the tunes, so it was wonderful to hear them again.  You won't be disappointed with this.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Fun, easy game to play. This game is similar to temple run. The graphics are amazing for a mobile device.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|Please if you are of those that remember and love great fantasy movies from the 80's surely you'll remember this one. I surely did! This Classic is a Must Have! ...
B00AJER3SE|5.0|This Blu-ray is markedly better than the older DVD version were.  I really enjoyed the improvements made on this Blu-ray version of this classic film,
B0006L0LOS|5.0|The transition from mousy ad artist to catwoman is very, very good. It also shows how the character accepts how she has changed and to use it to fight evil.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is pretty cool. It is so addicting because it never ends.I love it a lot<br /><br />I like it because  of the fact that it goes on forever.even thou I suck at I<br />It,  it's fun
B000002MX7|4.0|CK is like a world wonder. She has tried it all. Loved her with Rufus and her solo career is unmatched. Arif made her funk so real and sophisticated. I think her &#34;What cha gonna do for me&#34; album is top 10 all time. The tracks still shine today. And the Q produced Masterjam album cannot be equaled. So many have imitated her but CK is a solo bird in flight. Soul singers have to study her like Aretha to pass the test.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This is a beginning of an adventure series.  I enjoyed the first book and am well into the second of the series.
B00992CF6W|3.0|we have loved this game and even used in our homeschool. the updates so far have been great ...but this beast update removed the ability to go into another players world. each of us, in our family has a kindle and we used to play a family game of minecraft often. now our favorite aspect of the game (family togetherness) is gone. we don't want to pay to play online with strangers, we want to play with just the 3 of us in our house again. bribing that back would bring me back to 5 stars again.
B003ASLJMW|4.0|The movie keeps you wondering if the plane is going to be stolen because the character played by Clint Eastwood keeps having flashbacks.
B006678VWA|5.0|I got just what I wanted, and plus it was brand new. I cannot be any more pleased. Thanks a lot.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I like that you can grow your own and you don't have to buy them with gems, the dragons are too expensive that way, just wish it was easy to get the gemstone dragons with out buying them
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I first started watching Games of Thrones on HBO.  When I discoved it was taken from the George R. Martin books, I started reading the series.  It is very graphic and bloody at times.  Not for the weak of heart.
1931559317|5.0|This is a very good atlas for the stars it contains all seasons all season and invaluable for star gazers
0020442203|3.0|As an adult the book was ok....To much reading between the lines.  For young children they would just look at the movie without understanding of the story line.  For instance the oldest brother was selfish and rude to his youngest sister, greedy for power, and the witch's wand was a weapon.
B009KWU6Q2|1.0|With an all-star cast and award winning director they totally missed.  As I watched it I thought that it has to get better, but it didn't.  I was totally disappointed and felt that it was a waste of my time.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Very, very good read for a long time Clancy fan. Continues the Ryan saga with a splendid read, I'd recommend it to any fan.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its really cool. And with the changeable characters. I like it. But its really easy to get caught and stuff.<br />I LOVE the hoverborads.<br />I just like it a lot!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game! I did have some hard times on a few levels but its fuuuuuunnnnnnn!!!!!!!<br />update update,  right now!!! XD
B008VVT51U|5.0|I love this movie!  That's it, I simply love this movie!  It is so underrated.  The actors are fabulous and the humor is even better.  I suggested it to my high school students and they even loved it.  As one said, &#34;wow, they aren't any different than us...how is that?&#34; Come on, give it a try!
0152465073|1.0|I'm so so so sorry... giving 1 star to my favorite book :( But I want you focus your attention in this: It is the right translation, yeah, that which is out of print, Katherine Woods translation... the best ever... Please, please, please buy this one... I just want you enjoy the book as I does every time I read it. This edition is not so fancy but has the right words that will touch your heart...
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|Why would you kill off two people in one season? Downton Abbey was always a feel good show. This season was not!!!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This was an entertaining work.  I think it would have worked better for me as an audio book, given the author did the reading for the audio.  It would have helped with the really funny bits.  But....overall, a nice read.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|This is one of Mel Gibson's best all-around (acting, directing). His performance was powerful and passionate. His facial expressions left nothing to the imagination. I love movies of this genre, and this one deserves every award it received! I never tire of it!
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I absolutely love this album, the songs are well written and performed. I really enjoy listening to it, the beats of the various songs are just great.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Incredible portrayal of a terrible event.  Would like to see how they reproduced such an event with apparent accuracy.<br /><br />Enjoyed the film.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very enjoyable but left me wanting more. Graphics were good and upper levels obviously a little more challenging. Hope new levels are added.
B0000793Z9|5.0|New Gold Dream has got to be one of my favorite tracks of all times. Excellent sound on this CD.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a pretty good game. I enjoy playing it except for the collectionns part. to hard to collect everything.
0375815260|5.0|I bought this book to read with my 6-year old daughter. It was a great was for us to bond and me to help her begin to LOVE reading.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|As a devoted dachshund person I have been thoroughly entertained by this really creative read.  Want to know more about the exploits of Maze and her fellow dachshunds.
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|Did not work at all for me...I uninstalled right away. Need to work in order for me to keep an app.
B000002IQW|4.0|After I got my hands on the self titled \\"Skid Row\\" album, I knew that I needed more by these guys. \\"Slave to the Grind\\" was definitely a great addition too. Skid Row seemed to go for more of a heaven sound and Sebastian Bachs vocals did everything but disappoint.<br /><br />I will say that this cd was NOT as good as the first one in personal listening preference. However, the instrumentals, vocals and lyrics come together so well that this cd is still a masterpiece and should hopefully stay in in the collections of future generations.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this app. We live in a place where weather can be very unpredictable. I need to refer to this app frequently & have found its INFO accurate.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I like the ending the best it was so cute but the rest of the book was so awesome and so sad
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Rooney Mara IS Lisbeth Salander. And if you've read the books, this will mean a lot. Plot departs from the book a bit, but it's done well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Nice way to keep the brain fit and nimble. Not to difficult but challenging enough to keep you interested to the end.
B008602KQI|5.0|I am all about analyzing movies, so the message of this movie makes the common person really appreciate how lucky we are to have what we have and not take things for granted.  Of course I loved the book more than the movie, but this did a pretty good job over all.  Can't wait for the next one!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I am still learning how to use Facebook, but this app had been helpful. I needed it for my tablet.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this app.....not only can you put in your hometown but you can also put in the names of your favorite places so you can pretend you are there (like Lahaina, Maui or Yosemite, CA are two of my favorite places to visit).  It is definitely an essential app on my Kindle as I don't always have time to watch the news in the morning and it enables me to prepare for the day (as the S.F. Bay Area has microclimates, you never know what the weather is going to be like farther north or east when you live in San Jose).
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Even better than his other books. It's one of the best  books I've read in a long time. Totally excellent.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|You don't want to put it down.  As always David Baldacci does not disappoint.  If you like his style you must read this.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I personally love the game... but I have a hard time killing things like cows... my iron sword does 4 damage and the cow has like 4000 Hp! and they can run away from me!
0385751532|5.0|Today's seniors read it and weep.  Perhaps a bit tiresome, unless the reader appreciates a child's view of circumstances.  A  stupid puzzle to the youth of today who have no knowledge of WWII.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|It's a great game but it would be nice if the multiplayer worked for kindle fire. hopefully it gets changed to not require bluetooth
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|A real classic with excellent actors and, as a bonus, retired musicians and opera singers. Directed by Dustin Hoffman, this is a beautifully written and acted movie. The story is simple and true. The characters are memorable. There are no car crashes, no riotously so-so funny hi-jinx, but an intelligent story about seniors who love their art and have real relationships. Highly recommended.
B00A11AN6O|2.0|Handy if you just want a place to backup your photos to.  But nearly useless for photo-sharing.  You can share but only one file at a time.  You cannot share a folder. The app is a little under-cooked.
B000FC1MOQ|5.0|I first heard about this book from Oprah.  James Frey was on Oprah about this book and again later when she found that he had embellished parts of this book.  James was on Oprah again during her last year to explain what had happened and where he was in his life now.  I was intrigued about what all the fuss was about so I had to read it.  I loved this book.  I originally purchased it when I had a kindle and re-purchased it when I got my kindle, I love it that much.  I respect him in that he does not blame anyone for his addiction but himself, it is a decision every time.  I wish him the very best.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I thought it was a well written book . I can't wait to see the movie to compare them.  Must read!
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Love that I can play it on all systems. The movie quality is wonderful and it is a fun movie for the family.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Great book very easy to follow instructions with clear and concise pictures to guide you. If you. Have a problem just look at pictures and it will clarify. Really will have a good time with this book. Have already made the tiny globe knot.  Did not work the first time but looked again at the example and if worked out great.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Longmire is hero material with just enough cynicism to be a every day person.  Great characters, storey moves at even pace, unusual ending, good book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am a Pinterestholic.  I have it on my phone, computer and on my kindle.  You will spend many hours pinning things you must have!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Great characters and story. Can't wait to read the rest of  the books in this series.
B001KWTBQQ|3.0|This movie is clearly geared toward younger children rather than teens or adults. It also felt like this should have been an extended episode of The Clone Wars series rather than a feature film released to theaters. The reason I gave it 3 stars is that I did chuckle at some of the intended humor and some of the animation was great. I'm glad I only rented it instead of purchasing it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The Fifty Shades trilogy literally changed my perspective on life. It was such an amazing series I read it within 4 days and have read it three times total so far. It was hot and sexy yet so romantic. The story line is outstanding and it was so well written. I was completely impressed!
B00D3V5V7U|4.0|It's not quite a classic Sabbath album, but manages to capture some of the old magic of their early outings.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Collect items and clues as you attempt  to solve the levels and travel up the building.  It's a great exercise for your brain
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game for kids. I recommend it for anyone. Keep it going and keep updating it please. I want new competitions.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|buy it. own. this game is worth it.  you will enjoy this if you like destruction and death and chaos
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game always entrances me. I am still at the 2 suite stage, which I find challenging enough. I like the highest score count also.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome I was addicted when I first tried it. I love love love this gam. Its almost the same as temple run.
0440246318|5.0|Another excellent &#34;Reacher&#34; novel.  Lee Child keeps coming up with new & different (and edge-of-chair thrilling) situations for Jack Reacher to think (or fight) himself out of, usually in defense of the innocent.  I've always hoped his novels would be made into movies, but was bitterly disappointed by the person picked to depict Reacher in the one that's made it to the screen thus far.  Tom what's-his-name is the ANTITHESIS of everything Reacher is, looks like, and stands for - Rutger Hauer, where are you when we need you?  Nonetheless, the books are great, this one is no exception, and i'd heartily recommend it.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|I feel the movie is fairly well done with a difficult task in taking on the Wizard of Oz. Movie was slow in starting but the story was presented well. It is worth seeing.
B002XTXFU8|5.0|i really enjoyed this film, if you enjoy English or any foreign films then you'll like this one. not only is it entertaining but you'll have moments where your jaw will drop completely. so, yeah get this movie.
B0063IH60K|4.0|How can one not like the conventional game of solitaire. Hours of enjoyment with plenty of challenge to meet  everyone's needs.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Charlie's voice was so honest and true.  I think everyone could sympathize with how Charlie felt.
B001OMJGD0|4.0|This was a smart and fun reboot/return of the Superman franchise. The story was well-written and executed, particularly with the focus on the relationship between Superman/Clark Kent and Lois Lane. Kevin Spacey stole the show as Superman's most infamous archenemy, Lex Luthor.<br /><br />However, I am on the fence about the decision of Brandon Routh playing Superman. Sure, he strikes a resemblance with Christopher Reeve, but does that make him the best choice?<br /><br />I really feel that story/script/plot is the best part about this film.
B00CGPPMKU|1.0|For all you Picassos out there, this will be your cup of tea.<br />For you are a Rembrant, Monet, or Michelangelo, this will be frustrating.<br />It also forced closed on me while using the Amazon Demo app on my Mac Mini.<br />I uploaded a screen shot of a Hangman drawing that was done with the app.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Its an enjoyable game that can sometime be very annoying trying to find the matches.  I would recommend the game to anyone.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I read this book in two sittings.  Surprisingly sweet, sad, nail biting.  The characters are developed just enough, the ending is not lame.  Would recommend to anyone!
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|this game had potential. I liked how the farming mechanics worked, but the game was glitchy. no music or sounds would play and the game crashed as soon as I tried to play. what I find very annoying is nothing can be moved. once something is placed it stays there.(unless that's just another glitch I have).I not sure how much longer I'll play it with these annoying features. however I love the crops you can grow and the different things you can make with them.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|All my favorite Indiana Jones films in one easy to store box set. A Must have for true Indie Fans. Enjoy!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|It was like watching the movies for the first time.  The Blu Ray was perfect.  The deleted scenes and bonus features were great to watch especially the submarine scenes.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is pretty cool. It has its own unique way of taking care of your horse. I love it!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game for those who like puzzles and challenges, but don't want the frustration of unsolvable levels.  In this game you solve puzzles to get pieces or clues for other puzzles until you finally unlock the elevator to the next level.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|I really like the long term development of the characters in Ian Rankin;s DI Rebus series of books.  Detective Rebus has strengths we can all appreciate, but failures and flaws just like real people doing their jobs.  Driven and paying the price in his personal life for that drive is just like many you know who are driven, but fallible.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This flash is perfect for the amateur photographer. It is half the cost of some of the larger speedlights but if you're only shooting in the 20 to 40 foot range, it works perfectly. The ability to angle the flash to allow for bouncing is perfect for inside shots.
B0023S50DO|5.0|Deep Impact has to be the best disaster movie I have ever seen. It never fails to move me and the special effects are top notch. Plus the poster is just so cool.
B004PZ4HC8|5.0|I always like to read the books before watching the film versions. This was awesome. I didnt want to put the book down! They way its written is awesome
B001NOD0Q8|5.0|One of those rather rare books that move you to the point where you'll think about it the way lovers remember their lost love. Having read and greatly enjoyed Starship Troopers as well as The Forever War, I expected something of the sort with this one. The science-fiction may not be as \\"hard\\" as it is in the latter, nor the military as elaborate as the former, but Ender's Game tops both in terms of emotional impact and imagination. Intriguing all the way, the novel is rich in themes and characters. The prose, after an initial free indirect speech that I wasn't sure I would like (I got used to it and didn't mind after a few pages), is solid; the dialogues are often rivetting. This is one of those rare books that you think about during the day at work, hardly able to wait until you can read more.<br /><br />I can't insist enough on the emotional impact of this book, especially when compared with other science-fiction classics. While Philip K. Dick has gotten me used to forgetable characters who merely serve the story and aren't interesting on their own, Card has created a number of sharp characters with distinct ways of thinking and behaving. Science-fiction it is, but you should be aware that this is far from its most characteristic trait.<br /><br />Granted, the dialogue among children may, at first, appear difficult to believe, considering how sophisticated it is and how smart said children are, but after all, these very children are no regular kids: they're the elite that humanity has chosen to save itself, so one can accept such intellects even from 6-year-olds (\\"gifted\\" children, and others sharing similarities, actually do speak like that even at such young ages, so that's that).<br /><br />Unlike other novels dealing with an alien menace, this one has an ending that blew me away, didn't let me down, and didn't make me feel like I had been expecting more than it had in store. On the contrary, when I finished the book, all I could think was, \\"Woah...\\"<br /><br />Style-wise, Card aims for clarity, for character, for story. And this he does with great success: the immersion is flawless. This is certainly one of the best stories I have had the honor to read, science-fiction or otherwise. I would recommend it to anyone, regardless of whether they're into science-fiction or not; Ender's Game goes far beyond that.<br /><br />I expected a lot, but even I didn't expect this much. Truly a gem.
B000FBFMIO|4.0|another fun book in the series. really liked it.. it had an older &#34;wiser&#34; feel to the writing. looking forward to the rest of the trilogy.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|This app has worked perfectly for sharing lists between multiple people and multiple devices. This way we don't forget anything we need from the store and can prioritize and assign responsibility. One of my most used apps.
B000HZGNEU|5.0|Definitely one of the best Star Trek movies and by FAR the funniest one in the series. Highly recommended by this fan.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Certainly worth downloading!  I find it is more challenging than I anticipate.  Best of all, users are not required to purchase additional time, tokens, or pester friends to participate through Facebook!  :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son loves this game! I have a hard time getting him off it! It has very cute sound effects LOVE IT!
B0035XVVDY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies...it's rides high on suspense and drama, yet it shows a powerful message. Thank you Jamie for all that you do!!
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|This show was the companion to my high school and early college years. From 1st loves to heartbreak, this show covered every emotion and obstacle every teenager must face. Hands down this is my number 1 favorite show of all time.
B007R108WA|5.0|The movies is really good nice history not many wonderful speech and conversation but an the way event flows it drive you to the end. The end just marvelous. Recommended
B00C8985DU|5.0|Listening to the Wings Over America album when it was originally released in 1976 was probably the best tour for Paul McCartney.  Now, with the rerelease in it's box set fills in all of the gaps of what you imagined the Tour would have been.  Beyond the obvious remastered album, bonus cd from San Francisco and dvd, the overloaded books, backstage passes, tickets, photos from Linda and other professional photographers on the tour, art book and so much more.  It fills your imagination with reality of the tour.  Lastly, if you get a chance to see Paul on tour now, do it.  I saw the recent &#34;Out There&#34; Tour in Orlando in May and at Bonnaroo in Tennessee in June.  What a show, from the warm up of the DJ remix and most artistic video scroll of Macca/Beatles to Paul's almost 3 hour show.  At 71, his energy, show, pyrotechnics, set list diversity of the Out There Tour make this different from Wings Over America Tour but his best Tour since then.  In summary, BUY THIS NOW, see Paul on Tour as SOON AS YOU CAN!
055357342X|5.0|It's Martin with a minimum of bland exposition-y stretches. Gripping. There are more twists than seem possible. Definitely the best of his books that I've read.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|This is not a movie you watch for the storyline...mostly because there is none. Channing Tatum shirtless and gyrating is the only reason to watch this movie.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I enjoy reading about Lincoln.  This book, although a bit too long, presents many fascinating details surrounding Lincoln's political life and the lives of those with whom he associated.  It is good reading and never boring.
B0091LRZZW|5.0|This is a deep departure from Paul's Wings, Beatles or solo stuff.  For Beatles, Wings or solo fans of Paul, it won't be what you expect.  For Fans of Paul no matter what, the music reflects what he grew up with as a child, with soothing pre 60's music along with original music written today with &#34;My Valentine&#34; and nice mix from his &#34;Back to the Egg&#34; album with &#34;Baby's Request&#34;.  For those who are open, this is a great video, great music and will broaden your Macca senses.
0788859544|5.0|I was looking to replace my old VHS version of this film with the quality of a DVD; glad to have found it.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|For some reason my toddlers love the fairy movies. I haven't figured out why, but since I like them too I don't mind watching them over and over again. No complaints about the dvd; it plays well.
B00BS4PAXO|5.0|With one click I had the album right on my amazon cloud,  LOVE IT!!  Best Darlene Zschech album ever!!!!!<br /> When my children have asked to repeat the whole album just to praise and worship, and dance then I know they too feel his presence :)
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I  originally ordered the first season of True Blood because I was looking for a certain character and a certain story line. While I was wrong about the correct season and story line, I've still developed a serious True Blood habit. The story line is engaging and grabs you from the get go. The characters are well-written and the initial taste of them (no pun intended) automatically leaves one wanting more. I'm really looking forward to the rest of the seasons.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|Don't like new look. Too much STUFF. I'm on a cell phone...How big do u think this screen is.  Don't want to log into amazon everytime & Don't want it exposed by keeping logged in.  Want seperated!  I'm not going to keep it.  May drop Facebook completely if cant have seperate login from amazon. Games are just as bad. I want a game ON MY PHONE -not- on internet! Just for ME... not the world & expose my personal data. No satisfied.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This series is wonderful! So much action and humor.  Love watching it no matter how many times! My favorite is the last one with his father!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good game makes you think as well as challenges your sense of reasoning. would like to see more like this
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I really likes learning about the countryside & First Nations People the plot was a little thin,I could have enjoyed the story without the dead babies & how they really did not &#34;fit-in&#34; to the end plot
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius Rucker  He is an amazing musician. He is so talented. this is one of his best since switching genre's! He just gets better and better with every new release!! Wishing him all the best!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Sister-in-law and her children love this movie, and even learned to do the Cups song, so they were surprised to get this movie as a gift. Thanks!
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|I don't understand why everyone dislikes this app...not only do I find it relaxing but it also brings out the kid in me...I love to Doodle!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|This app brings the thrill of mtg games wherever you go. I particularly like it because I haven't played magic for quite some time and the way uou can play certain things and when have been list in the fog of my mind, but this game clears it right up. I did dock 1 star though because I have ran into some issues with leaving the game to message someone and then coming back to a stalled out game. And I never pay more than a buck or two for an app, if that, but come payday, my wife and I are both getting the full version.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Incredible bush craft knife. It does really well batoning through wood. It can do feather sticks but it doesn't do as great; the thick blade doesn't help with those.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I read other reviews that said the first half of the book was good but the second half was horrible. I thought the whole bookwas very suspensful and held my interest the whole time. And the end is definitely something you do not see coming!
B004Q3RDUW|5.0|The tragedy, suffering but also courage and perseverance of Afghani people through decades of war - brought to life and vivid relief through the characters. I will not hear a news story about Afghanistan without thinking of Mariam, Laila and Tariq - though fictional, representing the lives of millions. I hope this book helps the world to continue to remember the people of Afghanistan after 2014.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|The author keeps your interest peeked through out this novel.  It was hard to put it down when it was time to sleep!
B0011NVC9I|5.0|I was longing to watch this movie at my leasure because it's one of my favorites.....can't wait for the sequel!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing app that all ages will enjoy.It's kind of like Temple Run but way better so if you like action games GET THIS APP!!!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I have read all the Sookie books and was really looking forward to the ending but I have to say after rereading all 12 books to make sure I didnt forget anything...I ended up being disappointed in the final book.
B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|Can't beat Blake Shelton by much.  He is true to the heart and nice to look at too.  Make the music all the better.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I loved this game andi totally reccommend it to anyone who wants to try it but they need to get more levels SOON!!
B007HJ84ZK|1.0|It was my fault for buying this without looking into content.  I heard a portion of the soundtrack and thought I might try the first episode.  Just for those naive souls like me, this would definitely be rated R.  There is excessive and graphic violence and all out nudity.  Not my kind of show.  I was thinking it would be a Lord of the Rings type show, not at all.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Love this series I have read all the books except of coarse the last one which is not out yet. The later books go back giving more information as to how the silo's came about.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My younger son loves this game and spends hours a day playing it.  He seems to be addicted to anything Minecraft.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|it was fun, what I expected, and outside of that lame army dying when the mothership exploded it was fun
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game has gotten me through many sleepless nights. It is the best one person game out there. Everyone should have this game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very challenging, enjoyed very much, can't wait for more. Will recommed to family and friends. How soon for more rooms
B009UWYFFK|5.0|I think I watch this more than the kids do, I think it is entertaining and fun, like the movie.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I read the first two books in this &#34;trilogy&#34; and waited anxiously for the third instalment. So disappointed. Virtually no movement forward in the plot, just lots of aimless time spent dealing with the problems of other, minor characters. Sorry but I'm tired of Cary, Megumi and Eva's boss. I just wanted to know how Eva and Gideon would finally resolve their issues and come together at last. Well, (spoiler alert) it's not happening in this book!  Come on, Sylvia Day, a trilogy is three!  So disappointed to see you spin out a good story with a lot of rubbish for no good reason that I can think of.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Oh my gosh I love this game!!!! I love the different types of dragons and the bright colors and how the dragons fly... sometimes!!  :)
B004OR1XGK|5.0|This is easily the best book I have read on software construction. If you want to improve the quality of your work read this book.
B001UV4XWY|5.0|Wow, this one is different.  It has so many twists and turns that it keeps you guessing what is coming next.  End is kind of disturbing.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I was very disappointed.  I do believe the author has several personal issues; childhood, abandonment, etc. These problems came through with all his experiences.  This was not an objective account.  He really sounded like he needed therapy.  Very disappointed.  Also poorly written.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game will challenge you to think ahead, plan, and occasionally throw you into a surprising situation to get yourself out of.  I played the PS3 versions, and loved them. This is the same thing.  Excellent game, and worth the $.km
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|We just love this movie soooo much!! We did however,have to return it twice,until we realized it didn't work originally because our Blu Ray player needed updating..It would help if you would put a sticker on new DVD's that require players to be updated..We never had to return the first one but,we thought it was a bad DVD,since other new movies worked on our blu ray player. When I called Amazon,they never mentioned the player needed updating to play this movie...Will keep this in mind in the future..T.Y. Pat Mckeever
B005IQZB14|5.0|I too have always felt as though I have strayed from the life that I was brought up in. Cheryl captured so many emotions that I identified with, yet have some how kept hidden from my suburban identity that I have never quite grown into.  She showed us depth within the shallow details of life. She reminded me that moments quickly happen, yet find a seat in our soul that needs our company. I do enjoyed this journey that she shared, it cleansed my soul .......thank you.
B00C04H2VO|5.0|They finally make a set of these toys. I've been looking for them since the first movie but only found stuffed toys, tshirts etc. I want to string 3 minions together and hang them from my car antenna so they fly along with us but they are so cute and I don't want to break up the set. They need to make more types of these little guys like out of rubber and not so expensive then I will try my antenna idea haha.
0425263908|1.0|I did not like the personalities in Fifty Shades of Grey, and I did not like the people in the imitation Bared to You any better. Every encounter was petty and childish.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read hundreds of books, and I can honestly say that this book touched me like no other.  There was just something about it that spoke to me.  It began with us getting to meet Sky and her friend Six.  Two friends with some issues, but two very likeable girls.  Six goes away to school, leaving Sky to fen for herself in what turns out to be her first year in public school (she has always been home schooled).  Dean Holder enters the story when he and Sky have a couple of odd encounters that cause confusion for each of them and open up the story too lots of questions.  No full description coming from me about the rest of the story, just know that you should hold onto your seat, and that box  of tissues, because there are lots and lots of twists and turns.  This book was incrediblly engaging, incredibly sad, and incredibly beautiful. Sky and Holder, despite their young ages, have turned out to be one of THE strongest couples I have ever had the pleasure to read about.  They went through some horrific things and are able play off each other and come out the other side of it all, not unharmed, but alive and strong and together.  It was really so moving!  Even with the very heavy subject matter, I couldn't help but smile at the interactions between Six and Sky, then Holder and Sky in the lighter moments in the book.  But, I also cried and  I sobbed, a lot, but I still think its at the top of my list of books I've read and highly recommend it!
B007FIY3VW|1.0|you download the stuff from this app i would use it if it had some changes i want powerpoint now
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Don't buy this if you're looking for something to wear on your hip as an every day knife.  It's a beast.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Ok well to start off I randomly got the game cause I was bored. I got to like it n I want to continue to play it. It's addicting n fun. I keep playing it even if I'm busy. I just like how the game is. For now it's what I'm going to keep playing. Sowwi if I'm weird lol.
B0040QYROK|5.0|I have seen Metropolis before, and was really glad to be able to see a more complete version.  I just wish that Forry Ackerman, of Famous Monsters of Filmland, could have lived long enough to see this restored version.  It was his all time favorite movie from the time it came out when he was a small boy until the day he passed in 2008.
B001BANK32|4.0|Never gets old!  A true classic!  Welcome home Mr. Torrance!  Can't wait for Dr. Sleep!  Hurry September, cone quickly!  :-)
0425263924|5.0|I love this series, & am holding on for more, she clearly states at the end of this book, that their story isn't over,,,,& that's just fine by me. This book and series is an easy read, fun, exciting, & I love Sylvia Day (awesome writer) and this series. Waiting for more....
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Liked the movie and the acting. Felt bad for main character as he was in deep but had a valuable ending.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a fun way to spend time!! If you love horses then this is the app for you! I play this game as much as possible! My kids are always wanting to play this game with me!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Am enjoying another great read from Khaled Hosseini, if enjoy is the right word.  A real insight into Afghani culture.  Refreshing to read something different.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|When it comes to talk about this movie among friends I have never heard bad reputation. It is actually awesome!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Rich, complex characters, intriguing story, truly a great read. Singh has truly out done her previous stories with this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game made me think, and in a fan of any logic game. I'm sad that it passed to quickly. More rooms please!!!!
B002BJGYV2|5.0|I love this series!! I had every season but this one and decided I had to get it! Well worth the wait to find it on here.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Enjoying this great version of Mahjong. Lots of levels and different layouts. Easy to see and play.Have fun with it.
0812982622|5.0|The Orphan Master's Son is a work of consummate brilliance. It's depth, clarity, humor, irony, struggle, ultimately, clarity is a triumph of the human spirit. Johnson enormously detailed description of life in North Korea conjures a world that pivots around fathomless fear and crazed propaganda. This is the backdrop of this amazing novel. Here we read of the life of a contemporary John Doe who somehow rises through the ranks of this fantastically synthetic society. His life is a story of remarkable cunning matched with profound commitment to self and the power of that same self. If you are seeking a large novel to fill your time with light, humor, brilliant writing, then you simply cannot go wrong with this terrific book.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I'm not much of a action, thriller person, but, when I saw the previews, and the cast, I was hooked! It was just a fun movie to watch.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Kevin Spacey is a great &#34;bad guy.'  I was hooked on &#34;The West Wing&#34;.  I'm hoping they can keep the pace going for a few good seasons with this one.
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen captured her world and made it timeless in Pride and Prejudice.  What makes it so great is that once you remove the costumes, manner of speaking, etiquette and replace those with our era nothing much has changed because the &#34;pride and prejudice&#34; of each succeeding era remains essentially the same despite the advancement in technology.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Super fun and not too hard to where you cant figure it out. Actually enjoy quite a bit. Def recommend.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Alchemist is probably one of the best stories written ever, the story of boy searching for his dreams can translate into anyone's life, for those who believes that success is a journey not a destination ..
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is the best<br />I love it<br />It is the best<br />It has friggin ponies, how could it not be awesome
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Purchased this item for my 11-yr-old who adores Lego's and Minecraft.  He was THRILLED to see the two combined!  It has achieved a spot on the 'do not destroy this Lego sculpture' area of his room!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|A great entertaining movie for those who like action movies.  This movie has a slight sci-fi plot.  I will watch this movie over again many times.  If you haven't watched this movie, where have you been?  Best watch with home theater sound system 5.1.  The experience is totally different.  If you are watching with 5.1 sound system, must watch and listen to the end trailer the theme song Extreme Ways loudly.  You will be envelop into sounds bouncing around you.
B008GODP04|3.0|I will say that Anita Brookner writes well, though she broke a few rules, such as suddenly doing a paragraph from the other person's viewpoint when the story is otherwise told from the main character's viewpoint. Well, what author doesn't break a few rules? Knowing it had won the Booker prize, I had expected it to be sublime. It wasn't. It is about a quiet, rather reclusive author, a writer of romances, who stays at a dull Swiss hotel out of season, and observes boring and boorish people. Rather Barbara Pym-like. Small story in one location without very much occurring outside of a person's psychological development. I won't suggest it to my neighbor who has discovered reading while recovering from a broken ankle. But I will suggest it to my other neighbor who is a reader of all sorts of novels.<br />Author: The Wolf's Sun and A Devil Singing Small
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love how some games are hard and some are easy.... but don't get the mini game wires or something like that but over all its a great game!
B001NHN7TU|5.0|It's not &#34;great science fiction,&#34; but it was fun to watch. I also liked the fact that it contains no profanity - at least that I recall.
B00957T6X6|5.0|This book came highly recommended but I was skeptical.  Not the sort of thing I'm normally into.  Caught me on the first page and I've been turning them ever since!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this game just hard enough to make you think and figure it out but not too hard that you want to quit the game.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|So far, I'm in love with the story, but having Oprah's passages underlined along with her comments, influence my experience of the book and potentially shape my opinion. It's a distraction, even more so because I have no way of turning underlined passages off. Had I known this i.e. read it in the description of this item, I would have never bought this edition.
B004JNB4UO|4.0|I have to say it was a good movie overall.  But, it didn't emphasize enough that MacArthur, as a military officer, had little respect for civilian authority.

1623420148|5.0|This is the first review I have written, but I felt compelled to share how great this book is! If you are looking for a super fun, sexy, well written book this is for you! I loved Drew..he was so cocky..but it worked for him! Kate certainly knew how to keep him in line! Highly recommend this book..you will not be disappointed!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Although I am not the biggest fan of the kingdom of the crystal skull, I was still very excited to purchase my favorite films on bluray. I feel like I waited and checked several websites until one day amazon had it on sale. It was great and the movies are awesome
B0054SMIH6|5.0|This movie really kept my attention.  You wanted to find out the twists and turns that were involved in the big case that Matthew McConaughey's character got asked to accept.  Trying to figure out whether his client was really guilty or not was also a hook that kept me watching.  While the love scenes with Marisa Tomeii help show the character's softer side, the more interesting part was the whole question about the case and what the client actually did.  If you like trying to puzzle together the truth and the judicial system, you should watch this movie!
0345529057|5.0|I am watching the series on cable and wanted more information re: the families and the names etc. and yes I am getting it. If your a fan of the series you will enjoy the books even more.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|Love this movie it's an all time classic and it's good to see John Travolta young! Lol hot stuff! But I would not recommend you showing this to immature kids they won't get the story line and one told me it lacks \\"suspense\\". Which I think a good musical doesn't really need! Hope you enjoy it!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Here is what my 9 year old has to say: \\"Awesome. This is the original angry birds and it is as good as ever!!! With all the best birds and funnest levels!<br />I recommend it strongly! I would have given it 4 1/2 stars but I don't know how. Plus there are absolutely no adds! Which I give my approval to. And the app is free!<br />Also I recommend plants vs zombies app 99¢\\";&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;
B00881VLCE|3.0|It was perfect until it deleted the puzzle i was working on and stopped giving me the option to make puzzles with 200+ pieces. If you like small puzzles then this is for you.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I was initially hesitant to read this book as my grandmother died of Alzheimers. All I can say is I'm so glad my book club chose it! What a beautiful story of strength, courage, and love. I was so touched by Alice's honesty, her struggles, and the wisdom she showed; but more than anything, by the amazing love within her family.<br /><br />To now understand better what my grandmother must have felt has really opened my eyes and if possible, grown my respect for what a courageous woman she was. I wish so much that I had been older at the time and had been a better support to her.<br /><br />This book is a must read! Alice inspired me, touched me and will always remain in my heart.
0553386794|5.0|more in depth characters,  way more backstory, easy to follow every detail, very engaging, and never a dull moment!  A great read.
B009MB682W|5.0|This is an excellent collection.  For awhile, I wanted to buy some James Bond music (as my interest has rekindled lately) but wasn't sure where to start.  Should I get soundtracks from the various movies?  Should I just buy a few singles that especially stand out?  I came across this collection and fell in love.  I think it has all the theme songs from the movies except for the most recent from Skyfall.  I prefer the older songs like &#34;Man with the Golden Gun&#34; and &#34;We've Got All the Time in the World&#34; compared to the newer ones done by the likes of Sheryl Crow (although &#34;The World is Not Enough&#34; by Garbage and &#34;You Know My Name&#34; are excellent).  I listen to this a lot while I am at work, makes life a little more thrilling (desk job).  It also made a great gift for my dad for Father's Day!
B00006FDCD|4.0|I have the book and film of It!  It is one of my faves because of the cast and the excellent adaption of the book into film.  It shows to me more of a reality of childhood friends reuniting to solve and end a problem of their childhood!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wonderful, lots of fun for me and my daughter, great graphics , would recommend this app to my family and friends.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|had my attention from beginning to end. Dan Brown knows how to captivate a reader. Bravo! I can't wait to start Inferno
1594136238|5.0|This book challenged your beliefs in the innocence and guilt of a teenage boy.  It demanded that you continue to read without stopping as the events were intriguing and the hint of mystery hovered over the entire experience.  The role of family in the life of the characters was as different as the characters themselves.  Each turn would convince you one way then another.  The main character's struggle with his own father and the discipline he had to overcome travesty was woven through out the story.  While I knew something was up, I did not expect the ending.  A great read and I recommend it as it also tells the struggle with integrity in the mind of parents whose child is subject of a murder investigation.  And how denial controls our ability to step outside the bounds of &#34;doing what is right&#34; to doing what we feel we need to do.....
B00127RAJY|4.0|I am  not a huge fan of Jillian Michaels but she is known for weight loss. While I haven't lost, I have become so much stronger I can't believe it. I have actually built muscle which could explain no weight loss. I had already lost 10 lbs when I started the video. Easy to follow and if you stick it out, you will surprise yourself!
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Great value for great music. Not a bit disappointed. Love it and it downloaded the entire album quickly. Glad to have it.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Makes typing on Kindle much easier! And I like having 3 different tips. Great for fat fingers! I would recommend it to friends.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I am surprised. This item was shipped and sold from amazon. Ever since I got it, it has given me issues with the direction pad. It presses itself all the time. So when I am playing NBA 2K and pressing buttons on the button pad, for some reason the direction pad just starts pressing itself, reacting itself, play calls coming up itself, substitution popup. Most frustrating remote I have bought, and it was brought brand new. Terrible quality
B002RSDW80|5.0|I saw this DVD twice.  The 2nd time I read into it more.  It was a good story.  It had a moral to it also at the end.  Mary A. Cross
B006LSZECO|2.0|I heard rave reviews about this one, I just can't get past the writing style of it though. Can't say if it's just the beginning or the entire book. Distracting amount of unnecessary details in my opinion. Maybe I'll go back to it in the winter when I'm dying for something to do. Maybe the dull dreary gray will get me motivated to actually try this one again.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Of his three books, I enjoyed A Thousand Splendid Suns the most. This book (and The Kite Runner) however was also very worthwhile. I loved how interconnected the characters were - even when they weren't aware of it. It is a good reminder that we don't know how the ways we live our life touch others.<br /><br />Hosseini is a great story teller and each of the stories was descriptive and heartfelt. It was a bit challenging to switch gears and follow along as new stories were introduced, but I enjoyed the overall tapestry. I loved following the life of each of the characters. Learning about Afganistan in ways that are different from our CNN culture was also interesting.<br /><br />It was \\"smart\\" beach reading. Not fluffy at all but enjoyable enough to get comfortable and read over the course of a few vacation days.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like this app.  I have it on a few other devices and prefer their interfaces more than I do the kindles.  It sometime takes more time than I would like to load, but is probably due to the nature of the app and what it has to update each time.  All in all, a good app for weather.
B0042816YK|5.0|This DVD has a moral to it and it is at the very end.  I like the story.  It is very romantic and inspiring at the same time.  Mary A. Cross
B0030AJ4NQ|4.0|The song was great sound and just exactly what I was looking for when I cam here to find more music to add to the collection.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book. Well written and keeps you on your toes. I didn't want to put it down and ended up reading it twice.
B0086700CM|4.0|I have this app on a few of my other devices and have always enjoyed it for a brief distraction while killing time.  It sometimes crashes on my kindle but a brief reboot seems to fix the problem.  Great feel to the game and it doesn't take long to see why it's so popular.  Two thumbs up.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|An extremely impressive entry in the zombie genre and for me easily the best such since 1977's Dawn of the Dead. WWZ may break one of the supposed rules of the genre in its almost complete absence of gore but Brad Pitt's film more than compensates with an efficiently plotted linear storyline that remarkably shows no obvious signs of its troubled production, a spectacular sense of scale, a satisfactory balance between action and emotion rare in summer blockbusters and an often intense breakneck pace.<br /><br />There's a lot that I liked about WWZ, from the way the film utilizes its fast moving zombies as a symbol of the often frightening speed and density of everyday life, to supporting characters who are introduced only to be killed off without any of the bombast you'd have had to endure had the movie been directed by a Zack Snyder or Michael Bay. The emotional heart of the story - UN hotshot Gerry Lane's (Brad Pitt) relationship with his wife and kids - feels refreshingly damped down rather than overblown, believable without being schmaltzy. Rich and famous he may be but there's an interesting grounded quality to Pitt. Casting him as an Everyman sort of character doesn't seem like the kind of stretch it would if you had the likes of DiCaprio or Tom Cruise starring.<br /><br />The story is a ground-breaking amalgamation of zombie horror and one of those plague stories in which the hero is charged with finding a cure. The plot, which sends Gerry from Philly to South Korea, to Israel and then Wales in pursuit of the infection's source, never feels like it's just marking time.  Each location holds a clue and by the time Gerry figures out the ingenious solution en route to the film's climax the story tops even that by forcing our hero to make a virtual life or death decision. The payoff includes what might be the most well earned and enjoyable onscreen drink since Ice Cold In Alex.<br /><br />The action sequences are sensational with the (rightly) much talked about Israeli siege a standout. The chaos which leads to a hectic chase through narrow streets covered by a wire fence over which swarm countless zombies leads to an even more claustrophobic showdown inside a jumbo jet. The film is genuinely unnerving, often tense - especially the final third - and sometimes jump out of your seat scary. All without any bad language or explicit gore. There's a lesson there.<br /><br />Littered with unexpected touches - the viewer's shock at a would be suicide jump by a certain character who fears he's been infected and can't bear to see his family in danger, a female Israeli IDF soldier who becomes an unexpected ally of Gerry's and who isn't saddled with a lame romantic sub-plot between her and the star, a nuclear blast viewed from the cockpit of a plane in which no words, no explanation are offered and don't need to be (at this point in the movie it truly looks like game over for mankind) and perhaps best of all a last act that eschews the empty spectacle of so many summer blockbusters and goes instead for a tense, low-key and genuinely intimate climax that I'm happy to acknowledge had me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />But perhaps best of all is the film's underlying message, epitomized by an Israeli who tells Pitt's character that 'For every life we save, it's one less enemy we have to fight.' This is a movie about the end of the world that unlike so many other zombie films shows people refusing to retreat into small survivalist groups but instead doing their best to save as many lives as they can. It does not surprise me in the least that World War Z has defied months of hostile online sniping to become a big box office hit and I'm very happy it has. Highly recommended.
B009PNQUXO|4.0|I got this app for my kindle fire  HD and I loved it! You have to learn the reigns a bit, and that's why I only gave it four stars. Other than that, the only problem is that it crashes sometimes. :/ if that gets fixed, this app will be unstoppable!
B000NHG7BQ|3.0|Thank you for the speedy delivery.  This is truly a classic movie.  I do like the Theatrical version better. The story in my opinion was better than the Directors cut.  I would purchase from you again.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|It's a calculator. It works as expected. It's simple, straightforward, and easy to use.  Best of all, it's free.  You can't beat that.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Remembering that my Fire is not a PC this does a great job.  It is easy enough to use if you are comfortable with the touch keyboarding.  Able to store, send, received, edit really easily.  For the price... I am no longer without my office.  Highly recommend to those on the go that want access to documents.  Would not be without it.
B00BN4JQ6G|4.0|A great and comprehensive box set of quality tunes!  Each album has a unique sound and is worthy of playing day after day!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Super awesome game. 0.7.1 is the best update yet. This game is amazing. You can finally get  buckets and cake. I advise you to get this game. By far the best game in Amazon app store. A must get game! :)
1400052181|5.0|I bought this book for my Book Club and I bought it used. I cant belive that this book ever was touched by anyone. It is in excellent condition. I have yet to read it but I have heard nothing but praise about it. I also have to mention that the packaging of this book was wonderful. I dont like receiving packages filled with packing peanuts or tons of little bags filled with air. This cook came with other items and none of the corners of the book where bent or damaged, that is impressive.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|In the absence of Maxthon for Fire HD this is the next best choice.  Easy to navigate the web and handles favorites, bookmarks in a user friendly manner.  No problems with it on the Fire HD.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I have become totally addicted to this game. I own fresh water tanks with &quot;live&quot; fish so having a virtual saltwater reef rocks! Not to mention Nemo &amp; friends.<br />I don't like the derrogatory msg's from Stanley.<br /> 1-it's bullying us into buying something we may not want in our reef.<br />2- bullying and guilt trips in a game is an unethical practice for all ages. Surely your writers are clever enough to encourage item quest's without belittling your audience.<br />3- Pearls???? unless we buy them with real money...they have no incentive thus no purpose. Perhaps an oyster?
B000FCKGPC|3.0|This was tedious going.  Too many new characters and new places to remember.  But I will read the next book. I have too much time in it to stop.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is lots of fun to playbut it is alao very hard.  once you start playing you can't put it down.
B006M9NJFG|4.0|Has the detachable cup a great holster for carrying and the quality is good.  Got this as a gift and the person loved it.  Easy to carry and use.  Will probably buy some more from this vendor.
B00448SE4S|5.0|Great movie! Michael Cera is great as Scott Pilgrim! I lovwd watching this with my 9 year old son and 17 year old daughter!

0345803507|4.0|enjoyed reading the first time, however don't think I would rush to read again.  Should read it at least once
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this app but I think it should have a little more action to the game it's a good game though don't get me wrong it's a great game
B007KOYEOC|4.0|Very interesting book well written... and has given me a whole new look and attitude in the bedroom! really enjoyed it
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|I would recommend this book to females with a strong sense of adventure or life long questions that need to be answered.

2245267346|5.0|Good book to give as a gift for kids to learn Spanish. Easy to read and follow and the parents are loving it.
1932100660|5.0|I first read this book back in 2005, when it was first published, and I have read it about a dozen times since then. It is easily one of the most important books ever written. I highly recommend it along with the follow-up, Whole.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Predictable, lotsa giant holes in the plot.  Good action, lotsa bad guys wasted, just enough good guys sacrificed to make you hate the bad guys and wow at Tom...er, Jack, that is.
0345803485|4.0|Should read it at least once in your lifetime.  Don't think I will rush to read it again anytime soon
B0098VXMNE|5.0|Great. Plenty of twists and turns. Almost as good as the original. The acting is good and the combat is great.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|I absolutely love the fact that Joe is back and this album is a great way to do it! It's a must buy!
B008Y73940|5.0|Great story line! Movie kept you involved with it from start to finish! Mathew M plays a good part in this movie. The movie has a several plot twists so enjoy the show!
030789701X|5.0|This is a Must Have for the Dedicated Elder Scrolls Skyrim player. I have played 900 hours and haven't finished the main quest or the Dawnguard Main Quest. Skyrim offers expansive Open World game play, Freedom to build your character, unique weapons and armor to discover.  Weapons and armor to forge and enchant for yourself,  Easter Eggs, Alchemy charts,  Build your own Mansions (Hearthfire)  and so much more in game abilities,  that you would miss out on if you don't have the information that is packed in this edition.  The maps are precise and worthy to be framed, I did.  You won't regret this purchase.
0770437400|3.0|If you like short stories then this is ok. Just not my cup of tea. I liked the writing style but I was looking for a main character. Save your money.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|graphics are good!!! however very pricy for items on here. game money of course. time consuming because it uses real time which is kind of a bunker. I wish I could do more.
B00A9X9VAI|4.0|Don't read this review if you haven't seen the film.<br /><br />I agree with the plot holers, so I won't bug with them.  They are right.  A whole lot of stuff doesn't make sense, and we're supposed to just gobble that because it's time travel and, actually, the acting is good, and there are some really very cool scenes where time sort of morphs back and forth.  Pretty women, too.  Especially Bruce Willis's Chinese wife.  Very dignified.<br /><br />Since everyone has said everything, I'll point out the ending, which is \\"noble.\\"  For sure.  But, and a second warning if you've not seen it....<br /><br />Here's my question.  In the end, the noble younger Bruce goes nobler and breaks the loop by, supposedly, prohibiting the evil telepathic kid from becoming bitter after his mother person's potentially bloody demise.  So the loop is broken.  The guys disappear.  End of evil.<br /><br />Now, given that.  Are we supposed to assume the following.  The kid, who was prevented from becoming bitter by not being on the train feeling horrified, as the younger Bruce imagines, doesn't grow up to become the monster of time and space because said loop is broken?  If so...<br /><br />My dear friends.  After the aborted blow up, all the silver is lying in the road, next to the younger Bruce's or older or whatever futuristic golf cart.  If the loop were truly broken, and that's the thrust of the noble part, then the silver would not be there.  Nor the cart.  Nor any memory among anyone about what happened.  Nor the kid's wound.<br /><br />And so...look at the last scene of the kid grimacing menacingly.  The real loop was never broken, if you follow my logic.  Nothing changed.  All the Bruces did was actually fill in the plot for the kid. They should have killed him.  They were set up.  So the plot isn't about the triumph of nobility.  It's about the futility of nobility, the pathos of any human desire to become a good person.  Nothing gets any better.  Evil rules and the good guys get messed and killed.<br /><br />You tell me if I'm wrong, but I tend to have very few plot holes in my noggin.  If someone mentiioned this before, I apologize.  I didn't get that far down the list of reviews.  All apologies.

B00CRJSWBQ|5.0|Built a new computer based on the Asus Z87-Deluxe this weekend and it's a great board with lots of features. Build went very smoothly from putting it together, updating to the latest BIOS, setting up a RAID 1, to installing Windows 7 64bit. Time will as to how it holds up but so far everything works great. It appears to be very fast as well but then I'm upgrading from a 6 year old LGA 778 system.<br /><br />My Build:<br /><br />Asus Z87-Deluxe<br />Intel i7-4770<br />G Skill F3-1600C9Q-32GXM, 32Gb 4x8 memory modules<br />Western Digital RE 2Tb SATA 6Gb hard drives<br />Gigabyte GeForce GTX 660 OC 2GB GDDR5 PCI-Express 3.0<br />Noctua NH-C12P SE14 CPU Cooler.<br />Corsair AZ 750 80 Plus Gold Power Supply<br />Corsai Graphite 600T<br /><br />Once I had power to the motherboard I tried updating the BIOS through the \\"USB BIOS Flashback Button\\" on the back of the board using a FAT32 formatted flash drive.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game and I really enjoy it. I think it is also good for your reaction time as you have to react quickly and calmly. That's all from me.  Awesome person out
B00CE0ZY46|5.0|I LOVE this show.  so clever and funny and totally appropriate for everybody, all ages.  I watched this for 4 days straight when home with my sick 7 yr old.  Aardman folks are the best!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I enjoyed Gideon and Eva, but thought it could use a more story and less hot and heavy.<br />Loved the ending and am looking forward to next book.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This movie is very different and different is good.  The beginning is very dark and makes your head spin, but stay in your seat.  As the story progresses, you come out of the dark clouds into the Silver Lining.  It will have some surprising twists and unexpected funny parts.  I welcomed the normalcy of these characters with &#34;abnormal&#34; behaviors.  Can normal be defined?  Most of us can relate to at least one if not all of the characters to some degree.  The acting is excellent and believable. In the end, you'll enjoy this movie for being different and exposing characters we have all come in contact with at some point along life's journey.  Movie goes by very fast.  I would recommend Silver Linings Playbook to people who like family-style dramas and who are familiar with OCD and/or other mental health issues; you'll bond with these characters because of familiarity.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|love this game. Im ten. my fav. I think that they should make a LPS 2!!!!no problemo. I have 38pets and they are so cute. tell me how many u have!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book. Compelling and riveting. Characters were fascinating and well depicted. I could easily visualize each character. Really enjoyed the whole book.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I have finished all the Hunger games siries and all of the book were very good, exciting, fun,sad and adventurous soo i will  be thinking of reading the siries all over again
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Enjoyed the Lord of the Rings trilogy so expectations were high for The Hobbit.  With that said, this movie cannot compare.  The graphics are beautiful and that's what makes it bearable to sit through, but the story is way too long and the ending was expected. Unfortunately, it does not leave me wanting more.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game has really good graphics. I just wish you could with level up faster or have more jobs or get energy faster.
0740797719|5.0|James Gurney is a master of light.  Many of you might be familiar with his, &#34;Dinotopia&#34; project and remember his amazing use of light in his paintings.  Add that to his skills as a teacher and you have a resource you will come back to time and again.
0307730697|5.0|Great book...bought it for our son who is going into the military.  Heard an interview with writer on Family Life and was inspired to buy the book...thanks Family Life!
B00005V9HH|1.0|The story is slow and boring, too much talk, not enough action.<br /><br />Good for a nap. Don't waste your time.<br /><br />I suggest you spend 2 hours of your life watching some other movie.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I've read most of Neil's work and his is always at his best when dealing with the fragile moments between this world and others.  I don't mean the world of fairies either, I mean the world of the soul.  The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a fantastic tale, but it is really about healing.  To me, this is where Gaiman really shines, like twin moons over a peaceful farmhouse.
B008FOB124|5.0|After DCD split I was afraid there would never be another album.<br />Time went by and I moved on.<br />They just a few days ago I read they did another album I had never heard about.<br />And....<br />Well, DCD has influenced HOW many artists over how many different genres?<br />Too many to count actually.<br />\\"Within the Realm of a Dying Sun\\" will always be my gothic favorite so I was eager to see where Brendan and Lisa would take the new album after the tribal \\"Spirit Chaser\\".<br /><br />The album kicks off with the new agey \\"Children of the Sun\\".<br />And just like the previous albums, this one really doesn't sound much like any of their previous efforts.<br />Beautiful synths and orchestration.<br />Brendan still has golden pipes.<br />The one thing I notice is that the sound is much more mature and dynamic. Maybe because the passage of time has influenced Brendan and Lisa or maybe because the tech is so much more advanced now.<br />With an almost limitless amount of sounds to sample I'm not surprised the album is stunning.<br />Up next is \\"Anabasis\\".<br />This song reminds me of a futuristic \\"Spirit Chaser\\".<br />Gerrard kicks in and reminds all of us why she is so revered in the first place.<br />Exquisite vocals with an even more gorgeous background.<br />\\"Agape\\" is up next with a Middle Eastern flair and a hushed sense of urgency.<br />Incredible.<br />\\"Amnesia\\" is next and brings a bit more darkness and elegance to the album. Simply beautiful....though I must admit I didn't care for the repetitive note throughout the song... but DCD has always been known for doing this. It's not a major distraction.<br />\\"Kiko\\" kicks in with a huge, menacing Asian inspired soundscape. A great highlight for Lisa.<br />\\"Opium\\" is a dreamy track, very soothing and meditative.<br />\\"Return of the She King\\" is exactly what you'd expect it to be...Kingly.<br />Saving the best for last with \\"All in Good Time\\" it's dark, moody, sparse sounding song that really brings back memories of the groups earlier works.<br /><br />The best thing about DCD has been their ability to defy categorization.<br />This album lives up to the bands legacy in every way.<br />The dominant themes seem to be tribal, Middle Eastern new age.<br />Stunning.<br />Contemporary.<br />A welcome return to the pair that has graced this world with so many exquisite sounds.<br />Highly recommended.s of the groups earlier works.<br /><br />The best thing about DCD has been their ability to defy categorization.<br />This album lives up to the bands legacy in every way.<br />The dominant themes seem to be tribal, Middle Eastern new age.<br />Stunning.<br />Contemporary.<br />A welcome return to the pair that has graced this world with so many exquisite sounds.<br />Highly recommended.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best and my and my family play it day in day out. I rate this game a 5.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|this game has and amazing storyline with great characters. The voice acting and personalities of each character is what really makes this game standout. Its graphically appealing and will give you many immersive hours of game play (40-70) The combat system is great and has a bit of a learning curve but once you get use to it you'll be on a roll. If you didn't know persona 4 also has a anime cartoon you can get it here on amazon it has nothing but great ratings if you want to check that out along with this to get into it even more.  this is hands down the best JRPG you can buy on the PS vita and also one of the best ever made.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|Hated to put it down. Quickly captured your attention and kept it.  Love Dan Brown books and will read them all.
B000002HGD|1.0|Here's a short list of what I did not like about this album:<br /><br />-unconvincing bleeding-heart \\"essays\\" in jacket<br />-often shallow lyrics<br />-random style-switches purely for the sake of random style-switches
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The game is absolutely wonderful and entertaining.  It kept me curious about what  the next puzzle would be. I couldn't put it down. I agree too short.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Expected it to be more about Tesla himself and his experiments.  Instead it was more like a self help book
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Read this because I love the Langdon adventures but now I will read any Dan Brown book.  Very entertaining writer.
B001L5YW9I|4.0|saw this movie when it came out.  I enjoyed it then and enjoyed it as much now. Highly recommend this movie
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|There were some funny scenes and decent acting, It is not as funny as Knocked Up and 40 Year Old Virgin, but definitely worth the watch if you are looking for something that will give you a few laughs.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|My media player on my kindle crashed so I got this. It works so great! Plus its free! Definitely the best
B001Q5397O|4.0|The title basically says it all. It's a movie about space aliens who come to Earth to kill people. Why they have red rubber noses, wear heavy face paint, blow-up party balloons, pop popcorn and ride tricycles is anybody's guess. But that's what makes it so much fun. Besides, without that campy concept, which plays with itself in all sorts of entertaining ways, there'd be nothing to distract from all the bad acting and technical blunders. Whoever edited the (awesome) theme song for the intro, for instance, by cutting-out the first chorus and sloppily pasting it back together, should be pied to death.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|I had the free version and it worked and recently I couldnt download videos. Just purchased PRO and been talking to CSR and told technical team on it. Really a waste of time and I agree with others..dont waste your money with this download til you see a review its fixed, especially from VEVO video site.
0544002318|5.0|A nutritional guide for every one! Vegan is definitely the way to a health body and a healthy enviroment! Read it!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|This is just about the best in the magic digital game series yet, and the little purchases and charges are what you expect from both the magic videogame series qnd wizards so don't let that discourage you from purcbasing this wonderful app
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game.  I wish there were more levels. It's just challenging enough so that it's not too easy and you don't have to be a genius to solve.  Worth downloading to kill some time.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Really sux.the game is money hungry yes it's free to down load but they are very stingy with bonuses and they are charging more for the higher levels than they should.and making it very difficult to finish
1609613937|5.0|The sooner you read this book...the better off you will be. McDougall is right...in order to stay satiated and maintain your energy you need to consume simple healthy starches. I eat mostly raw food, although I have healed myself be eating this way it does leave you wanting more. So, if you are not ill and want to loose weight and also maintain your energy and maintain a health enviroment inside and our adopt, and embrace this way of life
B003F3FJQO|4.0|This next edition was better than the first book. I would definitely recommend continued reading as the aeries gets better.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|It is a great spin to your average jigsaw puzzle. It is great for all ages. I find it fun and addicting
1609611543|5.0|This book ichanged the way I view eating and it really does work!  I can eat all I want and I've lost 15 pounds already!
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|I just got finished listening to this album that arrived in the mail today and it blew me away. I liked the previous album \\"Valtari\\", but this album is a 5 star general, compared. I was worried when I heard that the multi-instrumentalist wasn't in the band and that they were aiming for a industrial sound, and though they do bring new sounds into the mix, its for the better in all ways. I certainly wouldn't use the term industrial for this album...I also can understand how people compare it to masterpeices like \\"Takk\\", it is definitely THAT good!!! Dont let the album title video track \\"Kveikur\\" scare you into believing it's no good. With the album in context, even that song becomes lovely
1609611543|5.0|I can now understand that Gluten kills a person's good health.  He gives you details how gluten can affect your whole body.  Plus he gives you some good recipes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game really makes you think! Try it out! It's so much fun! I am addicted to this game! Love it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini continues to capture the readers with his wonderful characters and stories . Kite runner is still my favorite but this was a good read
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The world of the silo is compelling.  I found these to be highly entertaining. I recommend them highly. I'm off to purchase the next part of the series!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I read the book a second time, first from the middle to the end, and then from the beginning to the middle.<br /><br />All of you who are judging Cheryl, please read the beginning again. Unless you have experienced a loved one dying of cancer, you cannot really judge. She was such a young girl, and she was the only one who took care of her mother at that time. This book is a tribute to her mother. Her mother, who after being a battered wife finally had the courage to take her three children and leave. Her mother, who went to college too, when Cheryl went and got all A's. Her mother, who never complained, or was bitter at having to die such a painful death at such a young age.<br /><br />My father lost his wife of 42 years, and he too allowed himself behavior he would not have indulged in while she was living. His grief was so overwhelming he did his best to overcome it.<br /><br />She is often very honest, uses the four-letter \\"f\\" word more than is acceptable to me, but this generation does that. It is almost considered wholesome, used on prime time TV.<br /><br />Cheryl Strayed is a complex person: she is promisicious, irresponsible, loving, callous, intelligent, stupid, isolated, indulgent and disciplined. She does not fall into any type of stereotype hero, but she is as every inch a force to be dealt with as any other male hero that dominates our literature. And she is a real, honest heroine.<br /><br />She does talk about the trail, giving some history to some sites, and often compares the real thing to the description in her guidebook. She reads and she has a disciplined routine she seldom veers from.<br /><br />But most delightfully, the message that resonates in my brain is:  \\"Cheryl Strayed, but the Wilderness tamed her!\\"<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book.
B008476HBM|5.0|Amazing love this story, writing style, and grace. This book captivates and entertains, it truly makes you feel like you're a part of their world.
B007HUD6OS|3.0|Love Theodore - but there was not much mystery here at all.  Others in the series are better.  Will get the next one from the library
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|It sure isnt your standard bedtime Fairy Tale story.  I thought it was a very entertaining movie. Maybe not as good as some, but it had scenes that scared the heck out of me. When Jack & Isabella; got back to earth, I felt the end of the movie was there, but the action had just began.  I rented it on Prime Video & watched it twice. Maybe some of the dialouge was a little hard to understand; from the giants, but the 2nd time around I understood the talking better. I would rate the Special Effects a 10, & the Scenery, Costumes of the time period were amazeing. I would most definitely reccomend this movie to anyone.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I would love to believe there is more to life. Indeed, it seems that Life as we know it may only be sacred to us, and what he says echos what Edward Cayce (the reluctant prophet) said. But I have a problem, with what happens to murderers. I would hate to think that God loved them.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great escapist story. If I were 19 again I would have been swooning. I'd love to see this as a movie.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|This so called rapper is garbage.  If you want to hear real rap then try Tech N9ne or any other rapper on the Strange Music label.<br />Tech's newest CD drops on 7/30/13.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Love it!  Awesome series that keeps you watching. Just bought this series a couple days ago and already finished watching all episodes.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I understand the author kills off favorite and main characters. Sometimes the point of following favorite characters through the most gruesome scenes is the hope they win and achieve justice. If they don't win, then the book seems just pointless. We humans need hope.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is too addictive, I have not been able to do too much else.  I do enjoy the graphics and th gameplay!!!
B0094K1MH2|4.0|This movie was very well done but it might not be appropriate for all audiences.  There is a lot of gun violence, murder, and obvious alcoholism in the storyline. Thankfully, there wasn't any of gore and blood. It was relatively \\"clean violence\\". If there is such a thing...Anyway, use caution before you set down with your little ones to watch this movie. That being said, it was a good one.
B008NR90HQ|5.0|Was surprised to learn that Gary Moore passed away not too long ago. Every track on this blue ray is great fun to listen to and fun to watch the Stratacaster get worked by a brilliant guitarist.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|Classic Paramore. Classic mid 2000's pop-punk. Reminds me of middle school and early mornings watching videos on MTV before school.
0788861220|5.0|I stumbled upon this movie about a month ago and cannot get enough of it!  I've seen Chiwetel Ejiofor in several other movies but fell in LOVE with this man when I saw Kinky Boots!  He is PHENOMENAL in his role as Lola/Simon.  His acting, his singing, the facial expressions....the man is so versatile! This is a real feel-good type of movie.  I would really like to own this movie but refuse to pay the exorbitant amount I see others are selling it for.  AMAZON PLEASE RESTOCK THIS GEM OF A MOVIE!!!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|IT WAS OK DIDN'T GET FAR IN IT THEN STOP BUT  I THINK KIDS WOULD LIKE IT JUST BECAUSE IT DISNEY
B002TZS5GU|4.0|Good acting and an interesting story line, but by the time it was half over, I knew the ending and was no longer surprised by anything that happened.
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|WHAT A GREAT MOVIE!!! Great cast as well. In the beginning credits I thought to myself \\"oh this is gonna be one of those movies where it has a million famous actors but really it just hides the fact that it's terrible\\"... boy was I wrong. Great actors, great script and amazing performances! I've never actually seen anything with Rooney Mara (I just knew she was a -thing- from being in the American version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) but I am now a fan, she's an amazing actress!<br />Great script, not predictable (!!!), believable, and it had SO many twist and turns to the story, it felt very Shutter Island-ish. Ugh, loved it in general. Would recommend it to anyone and everyone, really.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|cry unique puzzles...easy enough to solve but it takes some time to work through. will be waiting for new levels!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|If you liked The Kite Runner you will love this one! So many well developed characters and story lines. Well done.
B008JFUNYG|4.0|Im not even Guna go into how hardcore this remake gets,this 1 is way more graffic,I got the impression this is what they wanted to do with the OG version but at the time lacked the technology.<br />Worth it
B003YFIUW8|4.0|There are a lot of situations in the news with similarities to this, but having written from the child's view point was interesting.<br />My book club read it and some found the child's language annoying others thought it added to the story. It's a terrible situation and no one has the right to do this to another human being. I would like to know the out come of the story and hope that it turned out on a positive note.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|I thought this was a great collection of CCR hits. If you don't have the other albums, this is a great way to get their hit songs on one CD or MP3 album.
147674355X|3.0|...but not quite as enthralling as the other reviews make it out to be.  I am an adult who reads a lot of YA fiction and based on other books in the same genre, it's a good story but not great.  Occasionally the in depth descriptions of every specific feeling the main character has gets to be a little tiresome especially when they're still being described in the same way 3/4 of the way through and often don't do much to help uncover any deeper understanding of the characters.  I found myself skimming many parts and once in a while wondering if I really wanted to keep reading when ultimately, it comes across despite all the ups and downs as a story that will end with everything wrapped up in a tidy bow.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game. Makes you think of what comes next. Some pieces work together, remember this if you have problems.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book but am not happy with the ending. I am hoping there is more to come.  Sorry for the quick review but I don't like reading long ones.
B00CGPPMKU|1.0|Why so they need under developmental test to access protected storage? Not installing until removed sucks you have to give credit of download them find out of permissions unless I missed it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is awesome its everything I was looking for!  its fun and teaches responsibility... :p I think ull love it too.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|It's rare for me to find an album I can listen to all the way though. I've already listened to this so many times and love it. I'm in it and can't hold my liquor are my two favorites. It's funny how people complain about him being creative with the beats, I think they're freaking awesome. Thanks for not making another boring record like 90% of the other 2013 rappers!
B004N6369Y|4.0|A good read. Hard to put down. Enjoyed it very much.  .Would read another one of this at this author's books again.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Very slow to start however, it does grab and keep our attention at times.<br />Has an unexpected ending.  Happy reading!
B008Y79HE6|3.0|The movie goes for, for the most part, exactly what you came here to see, Godzilla. He's big, he's powerful, he's awesome in this movie, if that's what you came to see then you will be satisfied. DO NOT come to this movie for anything that resembles a storyline, anything that comes close to &#34;romance&#34; and apart from Jean Reno i wouldn't really look to this movie for good acting.
B008CRC506|5.0|i love it thank you, it was a very fast shipment and just what i wanted i look forward for future orders
B0055PGUYU|5.0|breaks down habits and why we do them.Was fun reading it. And see why we do what we do !
B005M2A4D4|5.0|I ordered a DVD set, and it came sealed up and worked.  Doesn't need to be complicated.  I love Doctor Who.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I found this game to be everything it says. It is entertaining and passes the time quickly. I recommend this game.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|became a great fan of the tudors with the first season. started reading more and purchasing books related to the era.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|This movie is just ok.  It has a creepy ghost in it with some cool animation but the story is boring.
B00CLIJ9A6|5.0|A great movie about friendship, love and laughter. Maggie Smith shined in her performance along with her costars.  The film showed how much people can help each other.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Love the characters.  Hard to put down. Had some twists and turns that made me want to order the next book. Looking forward to next adventure.
1609613937|5.0|I thank God everyday for people like Dr McDougal for sharing with us the truth regarding nutrition and its relationship to health!  I have been following his guidelines for 2 1.2 years now and I am very healthy!  Prior to this time, I was very sick.  I was a type 2 diabetic, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.  I was on medication for all 3 problems.  After I changed my diet, I no longer needed my medications after just 21 days!!!  I am still healthy and singing Hallelujah!!
B00942G4UA|5.0|Where does your food come from?  Found out with Food Inc.  A must see if you have Amazon Prime especially because it's free!
0470474874|3.0|It had virtually nothing on &#34;IF&#34; and &#34;Embedded IF&#34; statements. I don't know what else to say. So that's it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun game..love it can't wait to play more..love the challenge and having to think on what goes where<br />Family game for sure..play with my daughter's
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Normally I read a different style of fiction but got caught up in the story and the writing. Really glad I chanced upon it.
0425263924|5.0|Loved this book, less then 24 hours and I was done and holding my breath for the next installment. Yes you heard me it doesnt END here!!!! I am looking forward to more of Gideon and Eva
148951418X|3.0|This is an excellent product for the Sportsman, but the title leads one to believe that detailed instructions are provided on how to use Hero 3.  However, most of the book seems to be dedicated to the various ways one would mount the GoPro to oneself and various vehicles.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This show has quickly pushed its way into my heart. The first 7 seasons are on Netflix, and (since I don't have cable) I didn't know when season 8 came on. I missed them on hulu so I bought the season. Still worth it, but I'll watch for next season more diligently. Challenge Accepted!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The graphics are great and I found the game to be challenging. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes to use their brain cells. Some levels are easy others are levels are very challenging. I really enjoyed the game.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|Very interesting approach for small to medium size business owners who want to grow like the big boys. The take-away message is &#34;work on your business not in your business&#34;.
B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|Great album.  She has a wonderful voice - some traits of Sarah, Billie and Betty Carter. Everyone on the album are superb and I will be waiting for their individual releases.<br />Carlton, Houston, TX
0062197266|5.0|came in good shape,  loved the story. hope I get more like this book,  like reading at the beach' so ordered more.....
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wow, I really love this game. You really have to look and think about what the clues you collect mean and where they go to progress to the next level. It definitely has a mystery about it. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes or loves mystery games.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Large font and quick calculations. It is my &#34;go to&#34; app on my iPad Mini for all of my calculation needs.
1609613937|5.0|Excellent, sensible, coherent.  I loved this book!  Life does not need to be incomprehensibly complex in all it's parts.  Diet and nutrition can be simplified and can resonate with common sense.  Starchy foods are delicious.  They will help you to be healthy and trim and save money!  Eat them.  And read this book to find out why!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|An incredible story of a businessman, inventor, and father of one of the world's most influential corporations in technology that will inspire you to do something.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Story had an interesting plot and presented another cultures ways. Characters were interesting but it was a little confusing with the chapters changing characters.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|1st book I couldn't put down, it is such an awesome read, and I generally don't like to read, but I highly recommend this one!
B00AALX5SI|5.0|This movie gave a beautiful autobiographical depiction of Katy's love to sing from a young girl to adulthood, all the while taking us on a tour from her first album. Throughout the tour we were blessed with different original videos of her, seeing how she felt about her music, her parents, from her teens to signing of all her record deals. It also depicted how touring for the fans does take a toll on a singers personal life and her body. If anyone is interested in a girls personal aspect of how a record artist has to promote their wares, this was a very good account.
B00BMUVUZG|4.0|The Theo Boone series is great. however a little too much repitition on character backgrounds in my opinion, but i am not an author! I look forward to an adult Theo some day.
B00CVFTDKU|5.0|This is a wonderful whodunit, with a seemingly endless supply of suspects, red herrings, twists and turns, and secrets to be unearthed. Most American TV shows don't bother to go this deeply into the characters - and I'm finding that I really enjoy a drama that provides me with characters that are more than cardboard cut-outs by the end. I also really enjoy that this story takes eight hours to be fully told, and doesn't simply wrap itself up in an hour or two.<br /><br />Broadchurch's primary strength is in the fantastic, stellar performances of its cast: David Tennant is brilliant as a driven, PITA, haunted, and seriously ill DI Hardy; Olivia Coleman develops from a bright and bubbly DS pissed at having her promotion stolen from beneath her into a haunted and suspicious woman; and Jody Whittaker and Andrew Buchan as the murdered boy's parents key into the emotions any parent would feel in their situation - and that's just to name a few, key roles.<br /><br />Another strength lies in the mechanics of storytelling at its best: making us care about the characters, whether they were main characters or supporting role only. Chibnall takes his time telling this story, and turns the spotlight of the plot on each &#34;suspect&#34; in turn, so that we have no cardboard cutout &#34;villains&#34;, but rather fallible humans from which to choose our suspects. He doesn't lay all the suspects out in front of us at once, but presents each in their turn as they would have come the the attention of the police. There are red herrings galore: plot twists and subtle misdirections that paint the character involved with suspicion, deservedly or no.<br /><br />And finally, there is a fantastic strength in the unflinching way the story wraps up, seeing the grief that such a small village where everybody knows everybody else's business would have to go through to begin the healing process.<br /><br />All in all, this program is the reason I ended up purchasing a region-free Blu-ray/DVD player, because I absolutely HAD to have this as soon as it was available.<br /><br />Give it a try.  It starts slowly, so be patient - but there are hints even in the first episode of the complexity of the story that is going to unfold.  I can't recommend this one highly enough.
B00CO8D3G4|1.0|I bought this book with the promise that I'll have my money refunded to me as long as i have reas it. Mr altucher hasn't gotten back to me after several emails.<br /><br />It's not about the money, but failing to live up to what you promise isn't great Man.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|the cast is high class british performance,<br />its reminds me of upstairs dounstairs - but more modern. overall the best of british performance
B003NX75B8|4.0|I am a huge John Green fan, and this book where he teamed up with David Levithan does not disappoint! It was a real page turner, when I finished a chapter I wanted to keep going to hear the other Will's story. I love that all the characters are flawed and that it is ok. I love the exploration of love in friendships and relationships and how both can be equally important. The ending was a little sweet, but don't be so cynical, embrace it, and in life enjoy the fall :) Wish there was a companion piece with the script for Tiny's musical.
159420411X|5.0|This book takes complex issues surrounding the explosion of data that we are all experiencing and makes the impact clear. It is readable, though I didn't rush through it like a novel, and when I finished it thought that we all need to understand probability, its value in today's world and the need to change the way I think.
B008602KQI|4.0|Surprisingly similar to the book, and VERY well acted, but disturbing theme. DEFINITELY NOT for kids, and probably even too disturbing for teenagers unless viewed with an adult.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a very good book, and nice sequal to the first Hunger games book.  I read it as an ebook and enjoyed it very much :)
B00190OHD6|5.0|I love this movie. It's such a sweet story and Irish accents are the best. :D Have definitely watched this more than once. Above the average romantic movie for sure.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Our daughter told us about it.  We watched Season 1 and then scurried to find Season 2.  We are totally hooked on this series and love it.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|It's a different Paramore, but it's still fantastic. This is one band that just never disappoints! Keep up the good work guys
1936719010|1.0|Without trick typesetting and VERY LARGE PRINT scattered meaninglessly over most of the pages this wouldn't have been a book, it would have been a pamphlet.<br />It was / is so forgettable I can't remember all the other reasons I thought it was a waste of my money.  I'd recommend that you save yours.  There are far better books to help you build a skill set.  I would particularly recommend The Talent Code, by Daniel Coyle.
B00CLIJ9A6|5.0|Dustin Hoffman has done a magnificent and subtle job of directing this gem.  His knowledge of opera, the opera cult, and the performers is unexpected and wonderful,  His understanding of these people is most moving.  One wonderful touch is the final scene of the movie as the camera views Beecham House from a great distance while we hear the performers not as they sing now, in old age, but as they were in their prime.  (The Sutherland/Pavarotti recording on Decca is used.)  I recommend without reservation..
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We are halfway through Season 3 and we simply love this series.  We can't wait until Season 4 is here.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is awesome I loved it but I would not let my daughter read it it is as inappropriate as it is romantic
055380684X|5.0|This is the one.  If you want to build a skill set doing almost anything, buy this book, read it, and keep it in your mind.  If you follow these instructions you will get where you want to go.<br />Coyle builds his entire thesis on recent scientific understanding of how the learning process takes place in the brain.  If you want to learn something, his methods will work for you.<br />Spoiler alert:  it's going to take a lot of hard work.<br />Buy this book.  It's inspiring.
B0076DELIG|4.0|The storyline is good but the characters did not seem as rounded as they usually are.  Every Bosch book up until The Black Box had a really approachable main character.  In this book Bosch seemed not as knowable.  It seemed to me that his personality was glossed over.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|really enjoyed the book untill the ending, thought it was stupid actually, unrealistic to say the least, pity as book was very readable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfers it had gave me the idea for my life and how to subscribe it if anyone liked Tebow click yes
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I have always hated Apple. Their walled garden with its proprietary connectors/software, their DRM, and their patent trolling tended to ruffle my feathers at every utterance of the phrase. As a result, the object of my distrust of the company was often times their iconic founder, Steve Jobs.<br /><br />After reading this book, I still hate Apple. However, I respect it a lot more than I did before, and I respect the man for what he is: a pioneer of modern culture and one of the founders of the digital era. I respect Jobs because this book lays out his story in an unbiased, engaging, and relatable manner.<br /><br />This book covers everything about the rise of Jobs and the home computer, from his battle with Wozniak to turn the computer from a hobbyist device to a deliverable to him putting Pixar on the map and the revolution of the music industry. The same binary thinking and reality distortion field that has led to Apple's recent patant trolling is the same binary thinking that led to our level of technology today.<br /><br />The book also (briefly) details the reason the competitors (Sony, Microsoft, IBM, et al) fail to respond to Apple's market presence, and how Apple's lack of fear with cannibalizing its own product sales resulted in higher company profits compared to companies (like Sony) which attempted to slow emerging divisions to artificially bolster sales in legacy divisions.<br /><br />The book wasn't kind to Steve. He comes off as an arrogant, crazy, narcissistic, tool that is so spoiled you want to throw him over your knee in the Wal-Mart aisle and wear the polish off of your leather belt. It is, however, fair. There's no fanboism in this book, there are no excuses, and there are no compromises.<br /><br />When combined with other books about Silicon Valley giants (Google, Microsoft, IBM), you're going to get a very accurate depiction of the rise of the personal computer. If you've ever wanted to get started on that history lesson, this would be my first recommendation.t recommendation.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I play this Mahjong everyday on my Kindle.  I do wish that it had the traditional layout, but they give you a number to choose from.
1613821654|4.0|The edition I read was from Wordsworth Classics (1993); I was unable to find it listed anywhere on Amazon. It is complete with an Introduction and a Preface, and, as far as I could tell, is faithful to the original text. Since Mary Shelley's book, we have been inundated with images and descriptions of Frankenstein's creature and other similar creatures. Many of these images have come to us via a plethora of films based on Mary's original idea, and somewhere in this entanglement of ideas and images, Mary's original story has been both distorted and even lost. The original story is well-written even if the presentation is, by today's standards, at times slightly archaic. \\"Frankenstein\\" may well be one of the first science fiction novels, but it is not without considerable thought and a deep understanding of human nature. That Victor Frankenstein was able to create such a creature was a wonder in itself, but, as Mary was well aware, creation without responsibility can only end in disaster, which, of course, is precisely what happened. You may well read this story as science fiction or even horror, but, in the end, it is the human element that is most disturbing: we do not need ugly, ungainly creatures to upset the equilibrium of life, we are quite adept at upsetting it ourselves.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This is really good historical fiction. Not too long and detailed but not too short. I read it right after reading The Storyteller which is one of the best books I've ever read, so in comparison I had to give Sarah's Key four stars out of five.
1416575464|5.0|Sent this to my mom as a new house gift. It's a gorgeous book.  She thought it was very useful as she has no real flare for decorating.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This is one of the greatest shows on television today! Great storyline and even better casting. I am now a fan!
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I like the different colors and brushes. I don't know why people said there's no differences with the brushes because I found there definitely were. My young daughter also enjoyed playing with this app, and thought it was great she could save her pictures to show others. Very vivid colors on the Kindle fire HD makes this app even nicer to play.
1619696231|2.0|The story was twice as long as necessary - way to much emoting and a weak plot.  The end was OK but the trail to get there was torturous.
B00A757EFW|3.0|This is a fun game, sadly my phone wasn't really built for this game. I have a Droid Pro to which half the phone is a keyboard, so the screen is small. Better game for a phone with a bigger display,
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I'm using the Ander 18W / 3.6A Car Charger to charge a iPhone 5 and iPad Retina together and it works very well. I changed the USB ports and the results are the same, iPhone always charged fast.<br />I intend to update this review with the time spent for charging a percentage of charge of each device.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|My son has this on his PS Vita and we play a kind of  'head to head'.  It is a fun game!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game. It was a fun way to spend some time of an evening. I recommend it for a person who casually likes puzzles.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Point and click adventure, very similar to Myst. I don't normally spend too much time on mobile games but with this one I literally put my 360 controller down and played this one religiously. It's fun and just the right amount of challenge. Here's a tip: Learn where to change the seasons, and explore everything after you do.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun and it makes you think. I enjoy puzzle games the most. Great Exercise for the mind.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|No explanation needed, this show is awesome! I am so sad it's over! :-( Definitely worth paying for! Buy it!
B000HKYBXA|5.0|love this film. love Kenneth Branagh and cast. So glad they felt the need to create this version, thank you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really loved it fond easy to do<br />I would recommend this app to horse lover's and fanatics and ofcors I love it cause is kid friendly
0767827791|5.0|I love this movie because it is timeless. Steamy love story between two beautiful people in a small. For the baby boomer generation or above. The music and dance scene is incredible.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Really enjoyed this game<br />lots of play and loved the bonus chapter. would love another. love these kinds of games.4.99 a little high but I guess you can't get something for nothing.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|:) a movie the family can enjoy. I liked it better then the world of oz and we purchased oz and rented giant slayer. I would recomd purchasing giant slayet and renting world of oz.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i cant believe how good this game is but the bad thing is that due to the update my house burnt down
B005LAIH9A|3.0|Picture quality poor. Picture was very dark, which greatly dis enhanced to all that were watching it. Would not recommend.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|This program finds the song, usually several versions.<br />Save it to your favorites. You can open and view whenever.<br />It saves me carrying around three notebooks and fubbling<br />to find what I'm looking for.<br />It is simple and perfect for having instant access to a song.
B006JN5KBG|1.0|It's such a shame that this classic, campy horror movie can only be enjoyed by the super rich with a limited release by Twilight Time aka Screen Archives Entertainment.<br /><br />I've noticed a number of studios framing out distribution to other distributors who jack up the prices and only print a limited number of copies. It's a shame the majority of fans can't enjoy them.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway Surfers is a pretty intense game when you really get into it and get really far. I would rate this three stars because every time you go to a new place it's always the same. Collect items to get some more items.
159463176X|4.0|It was aa little hard to follow as it skipped around but I enjoyed the story.  The authors description of the characters and their different reaction to their circumstances was fascinating.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I Love it! I Have bought season 1-7 so far and i can't wait for season 8 to come out so I can get it too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It could have better visuals, but overall a great app. Very entertaining, and fun. I was confused at first but then once I started playing I got the hang of it and could not stop!
B00COO2D6O|5.0|One of the funniest games I've ever played. Very addictive, I played for hours my first time. It's a lot better then the first one.
B000SXMS54|5.0|It's really hard to believe there are 1 and 2 star reviews about this album...there are so many awesome tracks.  Yes...awesome tracks.  Anyone who has heard dollars and cents, pyramid song, I might be wrong, PULK/PULL, you and whose army at a live concert knows that just these songs alone are better than most of the top 4 songs of any other given artist.  Gotta give a big \\"BOOO!!!\\" to all you 1 and 2 star folks.  I can see a 3 star from someone who hasn't listened to the album but a few times...4 and 5 for those that \\"get\\" Radiohead.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It is a awesome app but after you buy all the cars and levels you beat it so i would like more cars and levels
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This puzzle was a challenge and actually made you think some.  It was so rewarding to make it through the different levels.  I eagerly await the next installment.  Keep them coming, please!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book was great , it taught me words that I never new existed.<br />I rated this book with 5 stars because it lets people expand their vocabulary and use larger words.<br />I would reccommend this book to anyone whose vocabulary is very short and who use kindergarten words to try to described what they are saying.
141970642X|5.0|The book came on time, and was in perfect condition! It was everything I wanted, and I couldn't ask for a better product!
B005LAII12|1.0|I loved this movie but unfortunately the DVD I purhased came all scratched up and will not play for more than 10 minutes before it freezes.  Disapointed that quality is not checked before allowing purchase for previously viewed DVDs.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is for all ages :) It is interesting and fun to interact through a game that is designed for a horse lover
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This book was amazing because of the fact that it helped me understand words that I never knew existed.<br />I gave this book 5 stars because it was amazing and you can read it anywhere and it.helps you mature.<br />I would recommend this book to people who want to expand their vocabulary and want to make a difference in the world by showing people that its perfectly alright to use larger words and act mature.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game so unbelievable it is my favorite game on the iPod.I rate it 5 stars and I just love the updates because each one is in a different place.I just love this game so so so so so much.so that's my review and I hope you guys like the game just as much as I do.
B006P0FIB0|5.0|The family was in town so I thought I'd show off the new 3D TV.  I figured [[ASIN:B0053Y7T1G Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (Five-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy)]] would be a sure winner, so started with that one.  No one really seemed all that excited about it, but didn't say much so as to not hurt my feelings.  I even heard some snoring from the back row...<br /><br />After a snack break, I threw this one in, and everyone suddenly woke up and started responding to the movie with some emotion.  The Pirates (which is a good enough movie, of course) just looked like those popup books - like a series of 2D cutouts stacked in front of each other by comparison.  Three Musketeers drew you into the depths of the scene.  And there were the inevitable swords waving around your theater room and anxiety causing shots from airborne war machines.  Corny, but we do expect a little of that from a 3D film, don't we? The colors were bright and the scenes were well lit.<br /><br />Was it Alexandre Dumas?  No.  Was it loads of fun and well worth watching multiple times?  YES!
B0059WTMLW|4.0|This is one of my favorite games. Now, I can carry it with me and need no pencil. Good purchase.
0425263924|3.0|This book was ok I wish that we knew when the next book is coming out but I do love the Story of Eva and Gideon I think I was just expecting more but Im still a fan and will continue to read this series
B009KS4XRO|5.0|this game is awesome so you should get it will not mess up you're devise so get it now before u become a loser
B005LAII80|5.0|I had never heard of this but bought it because it was a 3D movie for under $15 and there are so few to choose from.  What a great bargain!  It's a fantastic and clever action-adventure/comic book/super hero/coming of age/post-apocalyptic type of movie and the 3D is extremely realistic.  Be ready with buckets to catch the blood coming out of the screen in this action packed blood-fest.  There are a couple of very creative scenes that I would never have expected to be filmed if I hadn't seen them here. Honest, you'll be amazed at a couple of them!  The choice of a drug that causes the users to live in \\"slow motion\\" is a particularly good plot device for a 3D movie, btw.  The really funny thing is how you can develop an empathy and respect for a character whose face is covered for the entire movie (except for a bit of chin).  Great satisfying ending, too.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love Angry birds free it keeps me entertained for hours with the sling shots  trying to get more stars with every game.t
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|The films of the massacre reminded me of The Ring.  Chilling and never saw the end coming!  Worth the rental.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is really easy but some were really hard I would recommend this to most ages it is really fun I would probably play it on the road when you're bored.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I really like this cover. It is leather which is something I really wanted but is it also very versatile. I love the many positions it can manage. The only drawback is that it is a bit heavy but I would buy it again knowing how it feels.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Love this book, but I am always interested in historical fiction books!  The orphan trains are so much a part of America's history.
B001NHNG64|5.0|For some reason, I love reading about Jack Reacher.  This book keeps you interested in finding out what's coming next!.
B001QC6QRC|5.0|I loved it.  Totally took me down memory lane.  I am excited to share it with my kids as they grow up.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Cant wait for the 3rd season to be offered so i can buy that one as well. the fourth season should be good
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|Enjoyable series for those that enjoy humor, action and a good story line.  Good tie in with mythologies and something for everyone.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|My kids, my husband and I all really liked this game, however it keeps freezing up and then locks up my kindle and it won't do anything. This is the only game I have ever had this happen.  Very disappointed.  Deleting the game before it really screws up my kindle.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|this was gift for my father who has wanted to see this show but in the mountains where he lives he does not get NBC very well.<br /><br />thank you
0345803485|5.0|I absolutely love the whole series, but I would definitely say the first book is the best. I recommend this to all my friends. You will enjoy!!!
B00BTV62KG|5.0|After 10 years Scofield come back with his project Uberjam. I prefer this one to the first one. This is more fresh, natural, less electronic and more direct. After one of his  masterwork \\"A moment of Peace\\" this is a collection of different dances grooves very nice for the summer. Definitely is a funky record, but very simple, with some rock touch, In the first one I think Scofield try to  capture the last Miles atmosphere , here only want to have fun, don't matter if  is reggae, funk or even rock. He play fantastic and the group is his mood. Avi Bornick on guitar, Andy Hess on bass, Adam Deitch and Louis Locato on drums and the very special guest John Medeski on keyboards, play like in a private session. I know that is not a super album, but since a buy I hear it more and more. Is not a deep album, is music only for pleasure. Better than the first Uberjam CD, this one is pure energy. And in this particular moments I need this kind of music. Fresh funky music, not only for jazz lovers is for anyone to love music.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book is almost indescribable. There are parts about this book that you will want to capture in your mind forever. You will be absolutely amazed. This author is a genius. There is nothing new I can say about this book. I've read it twice now. Desperately waiting for the 3rd book in this series to come out just like everyone else.
B000F48CD8|2.0|I haven't had the interest to give this much play time but other than Steady as She Goes this has been disappointing.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Who doesn't love the Indiana Jones movies! The complete set doesn't disappoint. I got it on sale at a great price from Amazon. These are DVDs that I will watch over and over.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|This movie is so good. The music, the characters, the story are just so good. This is one of those feel good movies. Can't wait for Rio 2. Hope it's just as good or better.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is my second time reading the book and its even better than the first.  On to book 3 again.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I was entertained yet it wasn't too easy. I cannot wait for additional levels to become available soon. I will. recommend this app.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a fun game that can help you pass the time. It can get frustrating at times but you see everything for a reason.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Could not put this book down !!!  Nothing beats laying on the beach and reading a really good book - Thank you Mr Grisham for enhancing my vacation to Ocean City !<br />  Ready for his next book !!
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|Another true example of when special effects don't save the day...<br /><br />This was one of the worst prequels I have ever seen...and I've seen Star Wars episodes I, II and III. Where to begin...<br /><br />The Acting:<br /><br />The acting was so poor that I looked to the monkey for any kind of dramatic emotion. The acting by James Franco, Mila Kunis and Zach Braff was lazy, unmoving and quite frankly pitiful. I would have rather seen Mark Wahlberg play the monkey and just glue fur all over him. I felt little to NO connection between Franco and Kunis and felt they could have built the characters more instead of focusing on the grand visual effects. Franko's lack of expression or enthusiasm in his Oz character was a huge turn off and did not allow for the audience to suspend their disbelief. None of the actors sold their roles. Dissapointment all around.<br /><br />Special Effects:<br /><br />You can tell the art department really did a fantastic job building the digital sets and expanding the scene beyond anything the original Wizard of Oz could have done. Had a very reminiscent Alice In Wonderland feel to it. But the visuals alone do not carry the weight of the film and shouldn't be relied upon to make a movie great. Great job in this department.<br /><br />The Musical Score:<br /><br />The score was decent but I felt they just kept replaying the same thing throughout the entire movie and didn't have me gasping or fill me with emotion like other masterpieces have.<br /><br />Overall Score:<br /><br />0.2/10  Worst movie I have seen in a long, long time. This deserves no awards, no recognition and no publicity. I hope the actors are ashamed of themselves and this is a true reflection of what Hollywood has become; complete crap. Why do people pay movie prices to see this garbage? Have people really forgotten what good cinema is? Shame on anyone who gave it more than 1 star.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's a fun game that sharpens your mind. There are quests and requests to get further through the game and solve mysteries.
B00D37UQ1K|4.0|I have read The Host in book format. I went to go see it in theaters and was a little disappointed it changed some things from the book that were great. I still love this movie, with drama and suspense. Of course there is romance. This is what made it a great book. Seeing it turned into a movie was really great. :)
B00CE379IM|4.0|I like magical type silly stuff and this movie was pretty good, kind a wish there was more of them.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game requires attention to small details.  Enjoyed going from one level to the next.  Looking forward to additional rooms.  This is a challenging but fun app.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|It was taking so long to download this game that I cancelled it, just wasn't worth the time it took...
B00CMYRVAO|4.0|This is R 'n B singer-songwriter Joe's 10th studio album titled 'Doubleback Evolution Of R 'n B' (12 tracks). The album is produced by the California based D. O. A. Joe still has a great vocal range that he demonstrates in this new CD release: e.g. wonderful high pitched vocals in the sweet slow-tempo/ballad track \\"Love & Sex\\" (a beautiful orchestral base track, great melody and a duet featuring Idols winner Fantasia), low range vocals as in the track \\"Magic City\\" and goes through his full vocal range as in the track \\"Compromise\\". He has great harmonies as in wonderful opening track \\"Something For You\\" (a wonderfuf track with great melody and an incredible horn section arrangements in this track: horns thrown in inteligently at appropriate intervals. Great job well done!) & the first single \\"I'd Rather Have A Love\\" and overall entertaining romantic lyrics as in the beautiful closing/title track \\"Double Back\\" (wonderful orchestral base track, great melody and lyrics about taking one's lover for granted until the lover is lost or gone).<br /><br />Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are \\"Something For You\\", \\"Love & Sex\\" & the title track \\"Double Back\\". The album has some highs and lows but on overall good compositions, great execution of the music and good production by D.O.A.<br /><br />Singer-songwriter Joe still has got it in this new 10th studio CD release 'Doubleback Evolution Of R 'n B', a recommended CD listening.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is really addicting! A lot of fun to play though. My friend and I like to play at the same time to see who can get thru the levels the quickest.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is quite amazing! Its great for kids and adults of all ages! About every four weeks the country changes and you are sent into a completely different place than before. With each setting you can see a different culture. This game is my favorite and amazing in so many ways!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I would expect nothing less from Hosseini.  He is a gifted storyteller and makes it very hard for the reader to put the book down.
1609611543|4.0|Don't knock it until you try it. Read this book and convince yourself that<br /> the altered wheat we eat today is BAD for you.  Gluten free, or wheat<br /> free meals are possible.  This book made me think positively, you CAN eat all fresh<br />veggies, fresh meats, fresh fruits. Thats not bad.  Wheat is not the only altered product<br /> in our food chain.  Now I worry about All of the altered products.<br />Dr Davis gives so much to think about.  This book is loaded with data.<br /> It has removed all doubt from my mind that wheat<br />free is the healthy way to live.
B005OUDDK0|5.0|There is not much else to say about this EP. I also suggest checking out his other albums - great stuff!
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|The free app of the day at the Amazon App Store for July 2, 2013 is Flowpaper from Diatom Studio Ltd.<br /><br />This is a nice drawing tool to make drawings similar to ones you make with that Spirograph toy from Hasbro.  There are options to change the pen and background colors and to import artwork from other programs.  There are even options to share and save your creations.  The app even appears to support drawing by using 2 fingers at the same time on the Kindle Fire tablet I tried it on.<br /><br />In the app's current form, I am giving it a solid 4 out of 5 star rating.<br /><br />I am deducting a star because this app could be easily improved a bit.  One example is to add a symmetry mode where if you draw in one spot on the screen it will draw the same thing in the opposite spot on the screen which would have been a rather nice addition to this app.<br /><br />Another idea which is missing is a button on the actual drawing screen which brings up the color selector thing on the actual drawing screen to change the background color without going into the color selection menu screen which would make it much simpler to see your picture with different background colors.  This should be fairly easy to implement since there are other menu buttons on the actual drawing screen already.<br /><br />I am sure there are other similar minor type improvements that could make this a slightly better app besides the 2 suggestions above.  Those are just 2 that I would have found to be nice additions to this app if the publisher is currently working on updating this app.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|very fun movie with lots of laughs, light hearted and covers all areas of child expecting. Enjoyed thoroughly, would recommend.
