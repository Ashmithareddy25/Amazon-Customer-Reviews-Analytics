B003ODL004|4.0|I can often rate a movie by the musical experience.  Often the first notes of a score signal something to me about the quality of the experience about to unfold, and when it works well the music stays with me as much as the imagery of the film itself.  In the case of Inception my memory of the music was... blank.  I couldn't recall a single aspect of the music after the film.<br /><br />Having heard some of the music again recently I was tempted into adding the score to my collection (helped by the bargain price) and I am glad that I did.  The music is far, far better than I (failed to) remember.
B0011FL7FA|5.0|This movie is a perfect mix of timeless music and an engaging story. They wove the music, special effects and choreograph into a story that captured the choatic times. I can watch this movie a thousand times and not get tired of it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game but too short. Need more rooms and could be more challenging. Looking forward to updates. What else is there to say.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|This is in DTS-HD Master Audio and sounds GREAT. Gives you the feeling you're really there! She has such  a beautiful voice along with the other backup vocals and instrumentals. HIGHLY recommend hearing Adele in this format if your receiver can process it.
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|I wanted to love this movie!and I did love parts of it. But. Was way too hard to follow. Acting was good. But just didn't explain we'll enough!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|very interesting book. held my interest until the end  made one wonder about things in their life. will definately recommend.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  Glad the author explained the medical terms in detail...for those of us who are not brain surgeons!  I usually don't read the same book twice, but may make an exception in this case.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|One day we just might be calling Gregory Porter the greatest male jazz vocalist of our time. He sings with such a soulful spirit it's hard to put into words. I have seen him live on two different occasions and truly enjoy watching the faces of people hearing him for the first time. Not only are his vocals amazing but lyrically he writes with the best. I have already preordered the new CD Liquid Spirit due out in September.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|I sometimes have trouble following le Carre but I took my time with this one and really enjoyed it.  It addresses today's concerns about espianoge, government control and public awareness.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Reviewed by: Amanda Jane Volovik \\"Chava\\" I am not a fan of Matrix Sequels or Inception. I am, however, a fan of 2001: A Space Odyssey. That being said, the multiple dimensions, duplicate beings, aliens or humans question, time/mind travel galore and related ambiguities of 'Oblivion' irritated me. On the positive side, the reason I didn't give it one star, but rather two stars, is some of the visual and plot similarities to seventies space movies, such as A Space Odyssey.<br /><br />To be fair, if you like to be left guessing at what is real or not in the movie, and are a fan of the movies I mentioned above, you may like this. There are parts that are comically far-fetched, and I must admit, I didn't need to understand those because they must have known it would be funny (we should hope).<br /><br />****SPOILER ALERT: The thought of thousands of Tom Cruises roaming the earth is a plot twist that I would not like to ever see in real life -  as one of him is enough for the world to handle real-time. Also, Melissa Leo as a coquettish southern space-station monitor who is actually a hologram for a hexagonal space god was a bit over the top (not a good use of even slightly hinting at 'HAL' in 2001: A Space Odyssey) :P
B005QYKD4I|3.0|Fun but the inevitable hero-gets-a-kiss denouement is getting old (along with the rest of the story line). If you haven't see any of the others it would probably be great but as it is, skip it unless you have absolutely nothing else to do... maybe you are sick?
193700788X|5.0|This is a great line of novels to read for any SCIFI and romance fans. both me and my husband have read them all. I have read them many times.
B003RHLIQ8|4.0|4 1/2 stars. Listed as 4 due to no closed captions available through the Amazon streaming product.<br /><br />Knowing how some series can be pulled without notice, I wanted to make sure that this ALWAYS stays in my Amazon library.<br /><br />So I purchased both seasons and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I've found this series to be fascinating with very few downsides, except for the vapid and shallow acting of Elyse Levesque in the role of Chloe Armstrong.<br /><br />Then again, perhaps she is being directed to appear vapid and shallow, in which case, she is outstanding.<br /><br />I really HATE Ming-Na Wen in her role as Camile Wray, but I think I'm supposed to hate her, which means she is doing a great job.<br /><br />It took me until the end of the second season to really see the subtle brilliance of David Blue's acting in his role as Eli Wallace.<br /><br />I would have to spoil the story to explain, so I'll let you discover what I mean by maturing character development.<br /><br />Who's the star? For me, it has been a tossup between Louis Ferreira as Col. Everett Young, Alaina Huffman as 1st Lt. Tamara Johansen and the Destiny ship herself.<br /><br />Johansen ultimately gets my vote because of the depth of her character and her amazing screen presence.<br /><br />She never misses a beat.<br /><br />Honorable mention for Jamil Walker Smith as Msgt. Ronald Greer.<br /><br />Oh, did I forget to mention that the part of Dr. Nicholas Rush was made for Robert Carlyle?<br /><br />His performance here should absolve him of his guilt for taking on the role of Mr Gold in Once Upon A Time.
B00B2QA646|5.0|Beautifully filmed, Keire Knightley and Aaron Taylor-Johnson [he is very handsome and beautiful, really HOT] both did an excellent job. Also liked Jude Law a lot.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|When is the next one coming out? I am so excited, I can not wait! Better than 50 Shades for sure!!
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I loved this film. It helps to see it several times so you can see who is who in any given century. Read the original novel and was disappointed. Bought the tie-in novel, but not reading it at present. To me, this film has added another dimension to film making, making films' interesting again. thank you
B00DAXXO98|5.0|,Good storyline.Great actors. Kept you interested. Would highly recommend. Do hope there is a Season 2 coming.<br />Will definitely watch it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is some awesome and fun to do when you do not want to play a different game this is the game to play
B0078ZDYW6|5.0|An insane and stupid kind of action/comedy/sci-fi/they-weren't-sure movie that would never be made today... but 100% entertaining through and through as a good bad movie.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|Great movie, classic, should be required reading for anyone in sales! Each character represents someone you know or have worked with.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Trekkie so of course I loved it. Liked the story like and the way it dovetailed with the other Startrek stories.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie but who am I watch it you will like it spend the money what else are you doing
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Loved it! I took it to Europe (Spain, Portugal and France) and it worked great, fast and was dependable. I liked it so much better than the charger that came with the Fire when I bought it.
B004R0WKNE|5.0|I watched it already before but I watched it again because its really funny and amazing movie I really like Rachel Adams much...
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Inspirational, great guide to living successfully. All of these principles are essential to achieving success through everyday actions. Two thumbs up!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|If you're like me, I started with Hunger Games and couldn't put it down. Waited to read Catching Fire because I wasn't sure if I was up for more Games. After the second book though, you are committed and pretty much have to read this one to figure out how it all ends. Unfortunately, there's not much of a &#34;happy&#34; ending and I can't even say that you can end the book with much satisfaction... Other than knowing that for now the Games are over. Much despair and emptiness with only a slight glimmer of hope mixed with in trepidation in the epilogue. That being said, the book is very well written and pieces are nicely tied together and wrapped up without leaving you hanging.<br /><br />Now I'll be looking for my next book that can draw me in and captivate me the way this trilogy did. Ay suggestions?
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|great character development in session two<br /><br />a little weak at the beginning of session three whilel the plot is more interesting as it evolves forward
030746363X|5.0|Loved it.  You can tell the author is passionate about his research. Love that Tim has isolated the 20% of what we do that achieve 80% of our success!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Season two, just as season one, was great. I've watched the first episode of season three... I hope they don't ruin the show.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|It was okay.  The story was not clear and it seemed a little silly at times.  But overall it was entertaining.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Well, except for Tom Baker.  Also my favorite companion, Rose Tyler. Plots, stories, special effects were spectacular as well. Bravo BBC!
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this show so much I think she would watch it every day if we allowed her.  She knows every car by name and their relationship to each other.  It's a great example of learning how not to judge others by their looks and the importance of being a good friend and surrounding yourself with good friends too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it, didn't like Matthew being killed off, or sybil.  I have told all my friends about it, so they will watch.
B005SAP45I|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this movie!  The characters are wonderful and the plot is exciting and well written! Each car is perfect with each voice. A great movie even on the 115th time...
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this game. It was fun to figure out the order of operations to create each ball. My only minor complaint is that it was short, I want more :) No glitches or problems playing it on my kindle fire HD.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this movie!  Great characters, great chemistry, wonderful writing.  I love to see the female lead have courage and strength and not waiting for her knight to show up....
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|So in love with this band.  Great message, awesome sound, and pure talent.  Mellow, funky, and soothing Indie rock!  I Love You, the Neighbourhood!
B006LSZECO|4.0|When a wife goes missing the day of her 5th anniversary, first shock and then chaos ensues,.As you follow the police trail, a mystery begins to unfold. With many characters involved, suspects  keep popping up and secrets from the past are revealed. What happened to Amy? The author keeps you guessing until the end and the resolution is surprising. Gone GIrl is a good summer read or a weekend escape.
B007BVOEPI|1.0|This should have been labeled pornography. My fault I guess for not thoroughly researching. Quite embarrassing when ordered for a family setting.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Not a very good game. The app is free but you have to buy token to play but the game play nice. So if you like UNO a lot get it.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|I bought this because I love that it has three different size tip options. The only thing bad that I can say about it is that the &#34;cover&#34; part only snaps onto one end. Other than that, I love it.
B000IZBP56|2.0|This was a great book. It is a shame to see it get hacked up in a horrible screenplay. Good acting and a great story but I believe they were doing the best they could with what they had to work with.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|It worked ok, I probably won't use it much, but it works.  Download was easy enough to do.  Thank you
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love the improved premium version which creates more variety...clever combinations and posibilitirs. Great. way to drift off or just calm down a bit.  Enjoy muchly!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Good but needs to come out with a bigger update, like fix unnamed items and let u use flint and steel in creative
0385528752|5.0|This is a book that would be useful no matter what you do in life. Really well written book. Big fan.
0316201545|5.0|I really liked the first book in this series, but it was obvious in some cases that it was a first book. So I was pleasantly surprised at how much the authors writing has improved for this second book. I absolutely loved this one. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. It was exciting and had a surprise ending that I didn't see coming, but upon reflection realized had been subtly hinted at throughout the story. I am middle-aged, but have a soft spot for fairytale related stories, so I really am enjoying this series and hope he continues them.
B00C6B9XCW|4.0|I've always wanted to buy this movie, but I never did.<br /><br />Not until I found this little guy on amazon.<br />You get blu-ray, DVD, digital copy! What more do want at this price!<br />Its a purchase I won't regret. Trust me you won't either if you love this movie as much as I do.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|They keep changing things and not for the better in some cases. Needs to be a way you can just delete what you don't want rather than having to check who, why, and what. Sometime you just don't want to see all the stuff that bombards your Facebook home page.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app! It challenges you to solve each one in a different way. I like how it helps me kill time while waiting in the dentist office. Fun & addictive. A wonderful solo game!
6047703739|1.0|DO NOT BUY IF LOOKING FOR VIETNAMESE LANGUAGE.<br />Outrageous false advertising.  Bought as a birthday gift for Vietnamese-speaker.  Terrible experience.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|I bought this movie because I want to watch it every few months to remind me of the power of trust, hope and love.  There is some &#34;fun&#34; and practicality her too!
B00DH1G7DS|2.0|playing on a kindle fire the options are lacking. the lack of a highlight UNTIL you actually place a number is a fairly serious flaw. Imho there are far superior sudoku games for free out there.
B0068FZ0GK|5.0|This is a feel-good movie everyone can see again and again.  I think it's one of Kevin Costners top 10 movies.  We need more movies like this to give us the suggestion of the power of hope and dreams and believing.  It's powerful and loving.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|This is a fantastic CD by Bruno Mars. I love it & listen to it often, especially when I exercise
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The title says it all. If you've already made it to season three, then no explanation is necessary! Enjoy the season finale, it will leave you wanting more!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|very fast paced and interesting game to play.  I enjoy the way you have to make split second decisions or you get eaten.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 2 year old watches me play and all he can do is laugh hysterically. Great game and somewhat challenging
B009YN2M7S|5.0|First time reading Nicholas Sparks...pleasantly surprised!<br />Great book, easy reading! Love his writing style. Will definitely be reading more of his books.
0865479410|5.0|From the very first chapter wherein the author attends a \\"Get Motivated!\\" seminar in San Antonio, this book takes off with wry wit and great descriptive reporting. The author takes us on a tour of America's `positive psychology' and 'new thought' landscape, but he doesn't drink any Koolaid along the way. On the contrary, we get a quick course on Seneca and the Stoics, and an interview with Dr Keith Seddon - Director of the Stoic Foundation. He also visits Buddhists Robert Aitken, Barry Magid, MD, pulls the robe off the emperor's new clothes in regards to `SMART' goals, drops in for a chat with Eckhart Tolle, ponders our need to feel secure with Bruce Scheier, visits some of the happiest people on earth in the slums of Kibera, Nairobi, and discusses denial of death with philosopher and psychotherapist Lauren Tillinghast. He is very readable and engaging every step of the way. My favorite chapter by far, and it had me laughing out loud, was The Museum of Failure. Yes, Virginia, there really is a Museum of Failure outside of Ann Arbor, MI, dedicated to \\"humanity's shattered dreams,\\" i.e. products that as it turns out, no one wants to buy. I don't want to ruin it for anyone so I shall say no more. This is a fun book that feeds the mind and engages the intellect. Highly recommended.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My kids (2 and 5 year old boys) love this movie. They have watched over and over many times. I recommend!
0064471837|5.0|I first read the Abhorsen series when I was a young adult for which the series is categorized. As an ADULT I re-read it every few years, and it is still as exciting, fascinating, and suspenseful as I remember. The main characters are well-rounded and refreshing as young women with realistic emotions and responses.<br />I also enjoy the mechanics of the world Nix has created. The system of magic is better explained and explored than in most fantasy novels. In Lirael especially, long sequences of the story are dedicated to the main character learning the nuances of the magic system through trial and error, and as the reader her curiousity becomes your own. It reminds me of one of my other favorite fantasy authors, Robin McKinley, in that way.<br />The Abhorsen series also has a perfect amount of horror and suspense. At times, I would find myself reading as fast as I could trying to get through the story as frantically as the characters tried to escape whatever terrifying monster/bad guy was after them.<br />The Abhorsen series remains one of my favorite series to this day. I zealously recommend it to everyone I know who shares an interest in sci-fi/fantasy novels.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love this book!  The storyline is very entertaining.  There is a lot of depth to the story, and it is believable.  The characters are well-developed and multi-dimensional.  I am looking forward to more books from her!
0756405890|5.0|Original idea, enticing characters, and a narrative that you won't be able to set down! Highly anticipating the third and final book in the series...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome...my son is 4 and he loves this game....it's so much fun!!!  We play on a daily basis!!!!
B003M70O5O|5.0|This is and always will be the best show ever. I can't wait for the next season to come out.
B000QRIGLC|3.0|I got put off by the glorify the military attitude of the author.  Makes you think about the influence the media has on our perceptions of the men who actually are doing the fighting for us, though.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Coolest &#34;helicopter&#34; ever seen (even though it's fake...). Should've seen it coming (the hints are there) but 2/3 through the film, Tom gets a big surprise (too!).<br /><br />I'm a long time sci-fi fan and this is one of the very best I can remember. Great film! Seen it 5 times already and looking forward to more!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book has a great story and it unfolds very nicely.  The characters are believable and the events keep you involved and interested.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i loved this book. kinda got lost during it but after few pages got back on track. really good book suggest it to anyone. read this book. dont read this book if you dont like bloodshed or loss of love.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is one of my favorite games I have. I don't have to spend real money unless I want to and there are so many different missions for u to complete that you wont have to buy diamonds or coins. I love this game!!
B00CHILW64|3.0|This was just OK. Well acted but has the feel of an A&E movie. This was based on a true story, however the characters were not well developed and I did feel connected to adults in the story. The children did tug at my heart strings.<br />The 2006 Tsunami: The Aftermath, was a much better movie and well worth renting.
B00E8B1358|4.0|Acting was good, liked the actors, the action was what I had hoped for the money. But I wish bruce willis could have had a longer roll
B004E547D8|5.0|I was eagerly waiting for Red 2 to come out, and heard that Red was terrific. It is indeed! I'm glad I bought it, I know I'll watch it again.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Yes its the Air Force prancing around on other planets, but its also MacGyver. This is one of the few shows I have no trouble watching. This is my second time through the seasons and the episodes don't get old.
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|I dislike that it is only horizontal...and I don't like that the inbox cannot be minimized so the actual email remains smaller..all in all, would just go to gmail.com and use that format.
B004OZOTSQ|3.0|The developer stopped actively developing on this application in the summer of 2012, and halted all development on this in May of 2013, according to his blog.<br /><br />That means the following problems will NOT be addressed:<br />1) [UPDATE: found that you can turn off the Flash object in the settings.  Nevermind this one.] The requirement for Flash to upload files from the host computer to your Android.  Flash is a problematic, proprietary, deprecated, insecure, 'heavy' file format.  There's no need for that if you are only uploading a file here or there.<br />2) Very little real security.  There is no HTTPS, only HTTP.  At least, unlike Splashtop which has ZERO security, WiFi File Explorer *does* allow you to set a password.  Problem? That password is transmitted in plain-text over HTTP.  In other words, never use this on a public wifi network, and especially on an open wifi hotspot!!<br />3) No timed expiration of the service.  For your protection, the sessions should have a time limit.<br /><br />Of course, with the wide success of DropBox, this app isn't as useful as it once was anyway.  But is it worth 99-cents? Certainly!  But for how long depends on how quickly the competition - as well as technologies - evolve whilst this one stands still.  In other words, get this for short-term usefulness and expect rapid decline in its value over the coming months.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Once you get used to the format the author chose, this book is a great story in the zombie apocalypse genre. Very different than the movie this summer that was based knit, but it kind of had to be since this book is just a collection of short stories from during and after this imagined war.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Thought I would try it cause I love bubble pop. I think I like this way better! Nice graphics and challenging enough for a game.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love this dictionary because it has pronunciations in both English and American English.  Perhaps other languages to but I don't know any others.  However, I can look up a foreign word and get the meaning in English.  And that it keeps a log of the words I've looked up.  This is great because I can't always remember what I read and I refresh my memory with the log.<br /><br />The definitions go way beyond the standard Webster type dictionary. For instance, a term that has a history will show an encyclopedia excerpt usually with pictures; arichtectural architectural terms, for example, may show the item, say an abuttment (sp?) will show a drawing.  A search for George IV will give a history, items in blue are links and can take you much further than you intended.  But the monarchy will have pictures of the royals and the family tree and where everyone fits in, etc.<br /><br />There are also games which can be fun, like Hangman, a spelling game, a guess the word from the definition game... great for waiting in line at the grocery store or at the doctor's office etc.<br /><br />I download this app on every device I have as it beats all the others by a landslide.<br /><br />I hope this review helps you to decide.<br /><br />Avid reader, Deb
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I used to love this app. Since the upgrade I absolutely hate it and wish I could have the old app back. I never asked for this upgrade and I don't want it!
B00BESM14U|5.0|I expected it to be a teen movie. But it has a lot of depth and can be watched by teens up to adults. Such a great movie, it blew my expectations away.
B000NY12LO|4.0|Another amazing Jodi Picoult story, it's disturbing, but mesmerizing! I couldn't put it down, and it kept my heart racing. Any parent will find the storyline disturbing, because it could be YOUR child!
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Parts were funny, but most of those I saw in the previews already. It was longer than it needed to be. Parts were right on for the brutal truths of marriage, but it made for a depressing movie.
B00E72OKAS|3.0|First off, I'm going to say that this game isn't terrible. Not a shining example for all other games to go by either, but it's pretty fun.<br /><br />Found it first through Armor Games ([...] played through it, and decided 'Ehh, why not? It's less than 2$, and games like this are oddly fun'. Ended up getting it through the Amazon Coins, and I was thinking it was going to involve tilting the Kindle around a lot. Pleasant surprise, it didn't. Just 3-4 touchscreen buttons (Personally only had some issues with the acceleration button picking up that I was touching it, but I chalk that up to tech issues more than game issues) for the main game, though you only really ever need to press two of them.<br /><br />The upgrade system is both simplified and expanded, which is nice. Still getting money from a (offscreen) mystery person who then lets you shop for vehicle upgrades (And I assume this mystery man is also the one who carefully re-arranges all the boxes and zombies when your rampage is over), which then let you get further in the level for more upgrades, etc. It's a fairly simple sort of 'get to the end of the level' or 'get as far as you can' to earn money to spend on upgrades (both parts and new vehicles, only just now getting to the pickup truck) to get you further for more money for more upgrades. At the end of a segment, you are presented with an option to double the money you earn at a checkpoint. Don't do what I did and spend it early, you only get one.<br /><br />In short, it's fun, probably worth the $1.25 (or so), and it's not a simple port. Hooray.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|All the movies included in this set are awesome. The first few don't have main menus but I'm ok with that.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case exceeded my expectations. Good solid case the unit fits into, and elastic strap that holds the cover in place is okay.  I did not think I was going to like it when I first opened the box, but I am not unhappy with its protective capabilities.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Really was skeptical because this is for my Kindle Fire HD - works great!  You can zoom in/out which is good for some of the harder to read stuff and you can go horizontal or veritcal (for kindle fire mind you) depending on how you want to read.  I use it in my woodshop a lot so its nice to have a quick reference.  Good job.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|I love most Pixar movies, this one included. My 18-month old son share my enthusiasm for these movies also, and he LOVES the Toy Story trilogy, so this movie made a fantastic addition to our collection.
B00DFFHUUA|5.0|Please don't expect a tear jerking, heart stirring movie about the love a man has for his country...or dog....or anything. It's GI Joe. A** will be kicked, jokes will be made and things will BLOW UP!<br />It was exactly what I expected and WORLDS better than the POS movie that preceded it .
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Very funny and very well done.  A good blend of humor, action, and special effects.  Also love Red 2 - I think it's a great sequel.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|This guy is far and away the most widely read author on the subject of motivation I've ever encountered. He provides lots of great resources to help one broaden ones grasp of this critical subject.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I'm glad I saw it because I've been a die-hard \\"DIE HARD\\" fan since the beginning; I HAD to see the wrap-up. This was not the best of the set, but it was satisfyingly similar enough, and true enough to the storyline to make it worthwhile. What was glaringly wrong? John would never have behaved like he did when first confronting his son. The cool thing about John, in every preceeding movie, is that he is saavy and aware -- even if he's hungover, or beaten down -- of what's really going down, before anyone else is. He wouldn't have blocked traffic and scolded his son, screaming in the street. That's not our John; it made him look ridiculous, and I fault the director for that -- this character is too well known and understood to make him act that stupid. The actor playing the son was believable as \\"Jack\\" in looks and manner. The story was plausible enough, and the setting was unique. As always, Willis delivered the rough-and-tumble, loveable tough guy we adore and love to root for, as only he can do. I hope he knows he's brought joy and entertainment to us all with this saga of John's attempt to always protect his family with all of his strength and cunning in the harshest-ever, most-extreme circumstances imaginable -- wherever that may be.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|3 stars, mostly for the acting. However, while the acting is top notch - Tom Lee Jones in particular is fantastic - Spielberg's direction of Daniel Day Lewis' Lincoln results in a portrait of a president who is not a quiet and reflective man of iron resolve, but rather a shrinking and frail man of iron resolve. While it is understandable that Lincoln's presidency took a toll on his health, Lincoln's physical stature appears to be a liability in Spielberg's eyes. We don't know what Lincoln was like in real life, but I don't think he was the man Spielberg tries to convey. Spielberg misses on another account, that being his focus of the Lincoln presidency during ratification of the 13th Amendment; it is the decidedly safe route to go as far as Hollywood is concerned. Despite the importance and the legacy of the 13th Amendment, I wish the movie had taken a less myopic view and captured all of Lincoln's presidency, especially for a movie that is going to clock in a 2 and 1/2 hours. A good effort that could have either been grander in scope or been tightened up a bit. Maybe next time, Steve-O.
B009POCG2C|5.0|I SAW THE MOVIE TWICE SO I DECIDED I HAD TO HAVE A COPY.  LOVE CLINT EASTWOOD.  LOVE A LOVE STORY.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator plus is great I love the history display and the large numbers on it OMG. It's so cool thanks
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I READ THE BOOK FIRST SO I KNEW THE PLOT.  I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS AS CLEAR IN THE MOVIE.  I DID ENJOY THE MOVIE AND THAT IS WHY I BOUGHT MY OWN COPY.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Its a good mix of fun with a little challenge. The directions could be better but I eventually figured it out. You do have to start the level back over if you exit before you finish that level.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is a great read and I have purchased several of them now for friends to read and enjoy...  Recommended reading.
B0061Q13V2|5.0|This book gives you a very good inside view of how hard the life of this athlete actually was. Who would have guessed it?<br />  She really proved that she was up to the challenge of life and what it hands you.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Different than the first. Not just a remake. Enjoyable and entertaining and now I have it to see at any time I choose.
B005SAP45I|4.0|While the story wasn't as good as the one for Cars, it still kept me and my family hooked.  As usual Pixar animation was top-notch and there were lots of clever details.  One warning, however:  The violence may be too much for younger kids.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season 3 was great! I love this series and how it follows history.<br />It is probably best to have watched Seasons 1 & 2 before purchasing 3.
B0061S0A64|4.0|I'm not a musician… even my bodily emissions are off-key.  (And sometimes, off color!)  But you needn't be a musician or have the ability to keep a beat to enjoy this.  It's mindless musical fun plus a good way to relax and blow off some steam with this app.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|ending was surprising such so that it prompted thoghts that perhaps funding was a key in terminating rather than really ending the series.  It was it's usual excellent self, the series, and hope that there will be a season four.... given the ending, there are a zillion ways it could go on in its next season.<br /><br />enjoyed the excellence of the acting, the sets, the history, and how the shifting of our ways affects us all...

B002JI94J4|4.0|A great addition for people  with a multi channel AV set up but as a B&W film the DVD was otherwise adequate
B000SW16M6|5.0|I had forgotten what a fun ride this movie is. Tom Cruise received a career boost from a great performance, and  Rebecca De Mornay... ooff! What a creature; in what was probably her most entertaining and sultry performance. If she was any hotter, she would burst into flames!! Those who can't sit back, relax and enjoy this movie should seek counseling...
B00CRVZRUS|4.0|It is a must if you have a multi channel av set up otherwise the remastered DVD Is comparable  l

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This review (and all book reviews) are via Donna, not Daniel. Anyway, I absolutely loved the first three seasons of Downton Abbey. Well written, exceptional cast, beautiful sets. Lots of intrigue downstairs, lots of airs upstairs. Interesting to contemplate how life would have been in such a situation. Can't wait for Season 4!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game and im so addicted to it, its great because the items move so it still makes you look instead of remembering where they are. Love it

B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This movie is like an old spaghetti western. It's great! I don't get bothered by the racial issues it may or may not explore. I just judge it based on great acting and a wonderfully entertaining story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it because you can play with friends in the same internet it's a great game buy it it's a really good game it has more mobs and more stuff
B0035LJY6C|5.0|I had always loved watching the cartoon series of the Addam's family. But the movie is even more enjoyable. I loved it. The story line is great and there are surprises everywhere. Looking forward to watching the second one as well. :)
B003U51D58|5.0|It's one of the best drama series that I have ever watched! I honestly believe that there is not one weak season.

1419705644|5.0|I thought it would be only like concept art and something silly for kids, but when it arrived it was shorter from what i expected so i got disappointed. Then i opened it and it was amazing, the illustration plus the articles, is something I'm really going to enjoy.  Highly recommended
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|I'm addicted to this series! going to order Season 3 when I'm finished with Season 2. Great characters and acting!
B00499QUK2|5.0|The entire cast is just wonderful! The writing is smart and well crafted. It not easy bringing decades old characters into the 21st century. The clever writing and incredible actors does just that. Love the show!
B002ZBPPHA|4.0|Video would not stream and eventually I gave up trying....liked the movie; saw about 2 minutes of it because it kept buffering :(
B0013UIUBC|4.0|I really like this movie, and if your a foodie, you will live it to. It has all the goings on in the kitchen of a restaurant, and a love story to boot. You can't beat the price for it on Amazon!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I CEO of this year,games and the first place for the first place for the first place for the next few years ago when I was going to get the first place of this game
B004IWR06S|5.0|Love it. Watched it probably 5xs now (including &#34;accidentally,&#34; ie, turn on TV and it's showing), and each time see something, not only different, but deeper. Really lovely piece of commerical art reflecting a spiritual layer that is the actual Truth of our existence. (Film does not come from a dogmatic POV.)
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I watched this on prime amazon at the urging of my best friend! I have to admit that I'm still not sure if I want to watch the rest of the season as I was not intrigued by it! She loves the show and has not missed an episode and we definitely like the same things so I guess i'm going to have to watch more.
B001DF68MA|5.0|My only concern is that the seat itself is only held on to the support bar by one screw. However, it seemed very sturdy and I feel comfortable enough with it. If it is mounted correctly, a helmet is used, and the added security of your arms encasing your child, I see absolutely no cause for concern even with just the one screw.<br /><br />I read a lot of concerns about how small the seat is. My daughter is 12 months and only 16 pounds, 26 inches long, so I was worried she wouldn't be big enough. The foot holsters and straps are on their smallest position and she fits perfectly and comfortably. The seat does look rather small, but when sitting properly, I think a much larger child would be comfortable in it as well. I recommend doing a test ride with just the seat before taking your child so you can get a feel for that little extra bulk when getting on/off, and turning corners. We are 5'4\\" & 5'8\\" and found absolutely no problem peddling.<br /><br />We are very happy to have our daughter within sight at all times, and she loves being in the middle of all the action. I've already recommended this product to friends.

B0000041ZT|5.0|Shostakovich's output is vast (15 symphonies and 15 string quartets to name a few) and in general his music can be difficult for beginners to get into, however, the Jazz Suites are a great introduction to the lighter side of Shostakovich (though admittedly not his best work). Describing these suites as Jazz Suites, possibly creates false expectations. This is not jazz as you may know it. Rather, as the movement names suggest, you will be confronted with dances, marches and waltzes, peppered with charm, whimsy and melodies that will follow you for days.<br /><br />Shostakovich composed two Jazz Suites. There appears to be a little controversy surrounding Jazz Suite No.2 (check wiki if you are interested). This may intrigue some and possibly cause some purists to deride my inaccuracies. To them, I say, \\"we are here for the music....and this is great music\\". These are fun works. The enthusiasm of the musicians is palpable and contagious. The first Jazz Suite is filled with excellently executed violin solos, unusual instruments and orchestration which should enchant even fickle listeners. The second Jazz Suite uses traditional orchestration, but the melodies are just as inventive and catchy. These suites are sheer pleasure from beginning to end.
B007L5LD9O|4.0|I like Austen movies, let's just say this. And this one is quite nice, even Paltrow sometimes looks like she could use a little more charism.<br />Anyway, the ambience is perfect and it's great for a Saturday evening.
B004WMKSH2|1.0|Audio was so scratchy as to be almost undiscernable and the picture was fuzzy that the entire video viewing was disappointing to say the least.  Have purchased other videos on demand from amazon without any trouble.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Thought provoking, entertaining, and even enough action and romance to keep the disinterested interested. Love your planet, while you can.
B005NB5RWM|5.0|Loved it as much as the first time. The HD made it look even more real on the television screen.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This version of minecraft is pretty impressively developed given that it's a mobile version. The only downside, I think, is that in the recent 0.7.1 update, multiplayer was replaced by realms which, in my opinion, need quite a bit of editing being that it is next to impossible to reserve space to play on realms.<br />  In the end, I think  that Minecraft PE has come long way and is one of the greatest games to come to a mobile device.  Though Minecraft speaks for itself without need of an opinion by being the top most successful game on Amazon and android.  So really about seven dollars is not a bad price for a game with such a great reputation as Minecraft has. Two thumbs up!  And believe me, if I had more thumbs, they'd be up in the air right along side them.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great Book with many links back to things that can be used to learn effective leadership and team building. No wonder this is required reading for marines.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A wonderful blend of characters, plot developments with twists, humor, and drama in a beautiful setting.  It's delightful to see how the Brits can be so lovable in their arrogance and so charming with their polite insults.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like the videos and I feel that it is updated sufficiently.<br />My son is on California and I am always curious about his weather!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|If you are the type who need a little help falling asleep at night then this app is for you. It is great for having calming background sounds to help you fall asleep.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Who can argue with the franchise? A pointless exercise that has enough CGI action to satisfy even the most demanding nerd.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Love this show! The casting was genius! I'm looking forward to the next season.  This will be easy to catch up on.
B000002KDI|5.0|I have to agree with the individual who has complained so bitterly about the removal of a key section from \\"Cortez the Killer\\" in order to fit onto a single CD.  My God, any song but that, one of my all time favorites.  (With apologies to vegetarians) it's like a waiter removing a perfectly prepared filet mignon from your table when you still had three bites left.<br />With that said, this is a very coherent album with a terrific set of songs performed exceptionally well.  If you know even the first thing about NY (and if you don't, welcome to Earth), then you know that his career has been all over the map so the traditional greatest hits package does not serve him well.  If you want a single retrospective to understand what all the fuss is about, this is the disc to get.<br />True, if you want to fully appreciate the beauty of \\"Cortez the Killer\\" then you need to buy the original version on Zuma.  But there are at least 10 NY albums that any serious fan of rock music has to own.  This is one of them.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|M. McConaughey does well, Reese has a secondary role however the 2 young boys really make the film.  Neckbone and his friend are just great
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this game. Glad it's on the kindle. Easy to navigate and simple to play. I like the new stuff they are putting out too.
B002BVQU5A|5.0|Thank you I love this movie I can watch it over and over again the cutest movie ever a must see
B006P4H7OW|3.0|I was told by many people to watch this series. Now that I have (or at least the first season), I'm really confused about why it's been so popular. I loved watching Jessica Lange and (most times) Evan Peters too. That said, most all of the other characters weren't interesting, or believable. The first episode was promising, but it just went downhill from there. By the finale, I felt like I was playing Monopoly with a five-year-old who was just making it up as s/he went along. This season had potential, but there were a lot of easy fixes and not enough depth. I kept watching for the set and costume designs.<br /><br />I was told that the next season is a completely different story. That's probably their best option as this season's story was stretched way too far for having so little substance.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun but makes you post things on Facebook and Twitter as goals........... That's the only part I don't enjoy the rest of it is Awesome:)
B006BDHAX0|2.0|Seems it takes quite a while to respond.  Have to punch each tile to get it selected.  No way to get a good score.  Tiring to play.  Some set ups are too small to acurately select tiles.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun app. I like how u have many different games to chose from.. I hope y'all enough it to..
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is fantastic. The object is to complete each scene by using things that are relevant to the scene that you input. Example: There is a level where you have to help make a snowman. You have to click the notebook and type in snow, branches, hat, coal, carrots....etc. Then after inputting the information into the notebook, these items appear on the screen, where you drag them to the machine. After you have gotten enough items to create the snowman, it is created and you earn a star and the level is over.<br />This game forces you to be creative and think of the different items you may need to earn the star. It has been a lot of fun for the whole family. A great purchase.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|It doesn't update very quickly, considering I'm getting ads for the Disco Box and it still hasn't updated at the time of writing. Otherwise, a really fun app!
B0095G5AFU|4.0|This app is great if you need to keep notes separate from one another. The options are unlimited. I personally had a little trouble with keeping it password protected, the app would sometimes keep it open, which defeated the purpose of the lock. You can personalize each notebook to your preference. Good app, needs a little work. Definitely worth the price.
B001JI72AI|5.0|This movie tells the epic story of Apollo 13 while remaining technically correct. As someone who grew up during the early years of space flight it brings back the &#34;can do&#34; attitude this country once had, and now seems to have lost.
B009T8XBBO|4.0|This is an entertaining game. You have to fix or build each town back up to its rightful glory. It is fun to try to accomplish it in the amount of time specified.
B00B935SUY|3.0|I enjoyed this movie mostly.  The first hour is actually about Sound City - its history, its people, all who have passed through there, and the hit records that originated there.  The story of Sound City itself is fascinating and insightful.  The last half-hour or so, while sort of intriguing, is really just about Dave Grohl and his cronies recording on the old Sound City board.  This is interesting for what its worth (&#34;Hey - there's Paul McCartney!  What's he doing there??&#34;) but it starts to look like more of an ego-trip at a certain point.
0321934962|5.0|This book is typical of John's talent.  I have read several of his books and have been fortunate to take a 4 day workshop with this great photographer and teacher.<br /><br />John doesn't write in a dry camera manual type style but instead makes the reading exciting.  Its a pleasure to read and learn from this interesting author.
0345536886|4.0|This story of a broken, run down law firm run by two sleazy, morally and ethically-starved lawyers taking on one of the biggest multinational drug companies on the planet is a classic David and Goliath affair.  The two flawed characters that comprise Figg & Finlay are joined by an escapee from the massive Chicago-based mega-firm Rogan Rothberg (Mr David Zinc) and it turns out that the Harvard-educated man is a potential saving grace for his new employer.  It turns out that - unsurprisingly - events transpire against F &F as they prepare (somewhat haphazardly and amateurishly) for their day in the spotlight as false and bad assumptions turn out to be as hollow and as useless as an empty promise.  Which these two sleaze bags make plenty of.<br /><br />An unexciting opening to this book gives the reader plenty of insight into the world of courtrooms, law firms and preparations but you may well snigger and laugh to yourself at the infighting, melodrama and general nastiness on display in the offices of Figg & Finlay.  The true value of justice is seen in the walking personification of the ideal as David Zinc takes hold of the baton for truth and justice as he fights for victims of corruption and brutality as well as holding out for a poor family of immigrants whose son was poisoned by a lead-tainted toy.  The book improves as you progress through it, and despite an obvious hint given to the reader on a silver platter by Mr Grisham, the ending is sure to entertain and leave the reader with a sense of wonder and intrigue at the machinations of living justice in America.<br /><br />Overall, THE LITIGATORS is a fine example of the modern day courtroom drama.  The story is a little too predictable and when you start a book with a model (ie: Figg & Finlay) that is as broken as this one is from the beginning, it is hard to see any way for it to be fixed without a lot of hard work, heart break and lessons learnt.  The story is not quite a classic but it is still an awesome read and a must buy for anyone who likes to think as they are entertained.<br /><br />BFN Greggorio!and a must buy for anyone who likes to think as they are entertained.<br /><br />BFN Greggorio!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Started watching because of a recommendation.  Really enjoy the ongoing story.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone who enjoys sci fi stuff, or is just looking for something original to watch.<br /><br />The only side effect is I think I'm falling in love with Dunham.
B0007OCG56|1.0|I frequently read reviews on Amazon by people who dislike a movie, give it one reluctant star and say it's the worst movie ever made. They know, and we know, that they haven't seen every movie ever made. The reviewers of the movies I check out on Amazon have certainly avoided the 20% or 30% of the movies at the very bottom of the barrel. All of this is by way of explaining why I will try to avoid such exaggerations.  I can only say, without exaggeration, that &#34;Spanglish&#34; is one of the movies I've enjoyed least of any I've ever seen.  The idea is halfway between interesting and cringe-making  -  actually a little closer to cringe-making.  The script is extremely weak - in the way that a beginning improv class would be.  It has a few moments, provided by either Cloris Leachman or Shelby Bruce, who plays Paz Vega's daughter. (I'm not sure if Paz Vega is the B-list Salma Hayek or Salma Hayek is the B-list Paz Vega.) Anyway, the real problem lies elsewhere. As a big fan of Tea Leoni I have to assume that she played the neurotic and abrasive wife just as she was directed to play her. Big mistake.  And as someone who hasn't seen Adam Sandler in any other movies, I have to give him the benefit of the doubt and say that he probably couldn't be any worse in anything else. On the other hand, there's no evidence here that he could ever be any better in anything either.  His performance is sloppy, mindless and entirely unsympathetic, oddly enough since his character is supposed to be sympathetic, given the predicament he's in. If I've wasted anyone's time taking so long to tell them how appalling &#34;Spanglish&#34; is, at least I can hope that I've saved someone the extreme anguish of watching it.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I've really enjoyed this game. The challenges are intriguing. The game holds my attention and is addictive. I would recommend this to others.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Great book. Well written. Better then the hunger games. I finished it in a day. The second book is even better. So many twists and turns.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Bought the book because I love the show and just wanted to read the true insanity behind it all. Totally worth it, although much more confusing. LOOK, MA, I CAN READ.

B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Epic. This was the most unique sci-fi film ever made. Morgan Freeman in a sci fi movie, I couldn't ask for any thing better.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is the first book in one of my favorite trilogies and introduces you to a fantasy world like no other. While many other fantasy novels out there seem to reuse many ideas, Garth Nix's novels present fully developed worlds like no others I have ever read. Along with the unique worldsand ideas, Garth Nix is a master with words. He pulls you completely into to the story by giving enough description to feel like you are there but not so much that you get bogged down by the descriptions. They also move at good pace explaining what you need to know but pushing you to want to know what happens next. I have read this an the rest of the trilogy many times and it only gets better each time. There is also a novella that takes place in the same world with some of the same characters after Abhorsen and a much anticipated (at least by me and many other fans) prequel called Clariel scheduled to release in 2014. I hope you buy it and enjoy it at least half as much as I have loved this series and every other book or short story I've read by Garth Nix.
0064471837|5.0|Set in a world of magic, death, necromancers, and a talking cat, Sabriel must take on the duty of her missing father to set course on a perilous journey to restore the world to order and destroy an almost indestructible enemy.<br />Sabriel is one of the most inspiring and truly magnificent pieces of fantasy literature to grace bookshelves in the last decade.<br />Garth Nix has created not just one, but two wonderful landscapes (the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre) to set the backdrop of his novel, and has carefully crafted his characters, adding layers of depth and reality to them.<br />So ignore the Bella's and the Hermione's of the current literature plane, because Sabriel wins the crown hands down for best female protagonist ever.<br />Get buying fantasy fans or you will miss out on a diamond.

This is what appears to happen to the widow abducted by her husband-impersonating alien captor.<br /><br />Parts of the movie are a little farfetched. For instance, it takes a long time for the police to catch on as to what is happening despite such things as the alien fiery landing, the woman violating traffic law by speeding through red lights, his collisions with objects while he is the one driving, etc.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is such an outstanding series. The drama is the kind<br />you have no worries about bringing into your home as it is<br />subdued yet powerful. Actors and actresses in the film<br />are in a league of their own.
B002UZXJA6|4.0|Very enjoyable.  Nice arrangements and a good blend of songs that some are familiar while others were new to me.  Recommend very much.
030758836X|4.0|I really, really loved this book until I was about 80% through. Then it just got weird. Neither character got what they deserved - but I guess that was the point. That being said, I really enjoyed reading it but just wish the end had been more satisfying.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am an Animal Lover in the first place, so it's so FUN to play with Beauty.  I love doing all I've learned so far, like feeding him carrots and brushing his coat..and just watching him gallop.  It's so interesting.  I wish I knew MORE how to play the game because I really just stumble into things right how.  I'm open to hearing TIPS from anyone who has this Game down pat.
0316228583|3.0|JK Rowling is a great author - no denying that - she has a way with words. And it's understandable that she wants to stray from the HP series. But I had to force myself to get through this book. Way too many characters, and the material just wasn't interesting. It was depressing. I hope her next non-HP book is better.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Christine Baker skillfully moves us back and forth between two timelines and sets of characters, which are seamlessly interwoven.  We become engaged with the characters of the past as well as the those of the present, coming to understand why they behave as they do, and how they have become connected to each other.  Each scene, in both timelines, was well-drawn in terms of descriptive passages and timely dialogue.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
0316223239|5.0|I was a little unsure about this book when it was first given to me. It sat on my shelf for a year because I didn't really understand the premise. But once I started, I couldn't stop - literally. I was pulled in from the very beginning by the unique language and the view of character's world. And it kept getting better. I have recommended it to all of my friends and it still resonates with me six months after reading it! Great and DIFFERENT read!

0307744434|4.0|I enjoyed this story, though it did not live up to the hype surrounding it. While I was expecting something spectacular, it wasn't disappointing - just not as great as I thought it would be. I would have liked the magic to be a little more obvious. The characters were wonderful, and I was enthralled by how the circus operated, and the two characters complimented each other's work while competing against one another. The love story was delicately woven into the plot. The end definitely took some time to understand, but it was satisfying.

B00DH1G7DS|4.0|Sudoku is a common pastime around our house. In fact it holds a special place of honor, as there is always a Dell Sudoku book available in a certain area that there is no getting around spending some measure of time in each day.<br /><br />This app generates very acceptable Sudoku games, and has nice features. You measure your progress by how fast you solve puzzles at four different difficulty levels.<br /><br />You place a number into the puzzle by selecting a square in the puzzle, then tapping from the list of 1 to 9 below the puzzle. If you solve a set of numbers (for example all the 9s), that number disappears from your list below the puzzle. That is the only note-taking that I typically use in solving a Sudoku puzzle, so it suited me fine. Placing a number in the wrong square adds a time penalty to your score.<br /><br />There is an edit feature that allows you to place as many \\"number notes\\" in a square as you wish. If you solve one of those numbers in a row or column including that square, the matching noted number goes away.<br /><br />I dock a star for three reasons. First, the difficulty levels are not accurately predictive. The Medium puzzle I solved was somewhat more difficult than the Hard puzzle I solved. Compared to Dell book puzzles, I would say that the Easy level puzzles in this game are closer to Dell's Medium difficulty.<br /><br />Second, one of my favorite puzzle types are the puzzles with the \\"shaded X\\", which apparently are not in this game. It's not really fair to expect them to be, but since that is one of my favorite types it brings this game experience down a notch for me personally, and I might look for a game that includes that variation.<br /><br />Finally, you can't really make a mistake in this game, only add to your solved time. In \\"real world\\" puzzles, putting a number in an incorrect square as a mistake leads to interesting experiences later, especially as you try to figure out just where you went wrong and erase any squares filled incorrectly. LOL<br /><br />All in all, this was a very acceptable substitute to using paper and pencil, especially considering the sometimes inconvenience of having to fold the spine over, flip to the back to check your solution, etc.d incorrectly.

B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I might like it, but i will not get the chance to find out, because it refuses to run on my Kindle Fire. When I select it, it says that the game is loading, but it never finishes, so thumbs down on the game as it is. My wife and daughter love playing on her i-phone. So far very disappointed, and wondering if others have had the same problem with the game.

B003FFEX8C|3.0|I really like the idea of finding out more about Catwoman and her beginnings, but felt cheated of that goal in this film. There was too much focus on the sexy, improbable costume (those SHOES! Holy smokes, right?), and the dead-end relationship with the cop, and not enough focus on the cat lady and Midnight, and how those two influenced the birth and maturation of Catwoman.<br /><br />The best scene in the whole film is the one where she plays basketball with the cop, and that says a lot about why this film really doesn't work at all. I mean, what did a little one-on-one have to do with why Catwoman does what she does and is who she is?<br /><br />And that note at the end? Come on! What a waste of breath and time THAT was for this film. Cliched, hackneyed, call it what you will, it was terrible. I know these screenwriters get paid a royal MINT to write these movies -- what happened? Did they get tired? Did they let the intern take a shot? What?<br /><br />I suppose it was a fun, mindless Friday night movie for us, at the end of the day, but if I'd known then what I know now, I would've picked something else to while away two hours or so.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I was a latecomer to this series and since I saw one program I knew I had to see all of them!! I love the actors and the quirky storyline!!! Great series that was ended too early.
B00ACP3OOM|1.0|Loading songs was easy, though changing their names after they were loaded was not.  The conduction hearing mechanism worked OK before the product entered the water, but the player is NOT waterproof.  It leaked after a mere 600 meters of swimming.  There were water drops in front of the display, and it did not play after leaking.  Save your money.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|The last I'd seen of this show was season 3 when it originally aired. I was skeptical that they could really pick where they left off and still have compelling stories -- but they did. The photography is beautiful and haunting. The stories are sound. The lack of music keeps things tense. BUT... I do have a prejudice against Walt's wife. I can't stand the character she plays. So as long as I have the fast-forward close at hand, I really enjoy the show.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Graphics are really cool, and I always enjoy most Nevosoft games.  I had one problem in this game and it was more of a technical glitch than anything else.  It was very irritating, and felt like taking off a star for it but I enjoyed the game so much I didn't.  There is a part where you have to pick up a certain rune and place it on a certain matching place, and no matter how many time I tried it it wouldn't go.  I almost gave up on the game until it finally worked.  They need to get some bugs out.  Other than that really enjoyed it!
B005544TRQ|4.0|Wasn't sure about this when I started watching, but it's got me hooked. If you're tired of shoot'm ups and want to watch something that is intelligently written about a world most of us know little to nothing about (high brow Manhattan lawyer world), give it a try. The teaming of high stakes law, Gabriel Macht, with college drop out naive genius, Patrick Adams, works very well -- with mostly feel good endings. Fun show.

140006922X|1.0|In the book Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth, Reza Aslan writes that:<br />* &quot;Many Jews in first-century Palestine strove to live a life of zeal, each in his or her own way. But there were some who, in order to preserve their zealous ideals, were willing to resort to extreme acts of violence if necessary, not just against the Romans and the uncircumcised masses, but against their fellow Jews, those who dared submit to Rome. They were called zealots. These zealots should not be confused with the Zealot Party that would arise sixty years later, after the Jewish Revolt in 66 C.E.&quot; (Page 41)<br />* &quot;The story of that trial [before the Sanhedrin], as it is presented in the gospels, is full of contradictions and inconsistencies&quot; (Page 156)<br />* &quot;Jesus was executed by the Roman state for the crime of sedition. Everything else about the last days of Jesus of Nazareth must be interpreted through this singular, stubborn fact.&quot; (Page 156)<br /><br />Reza Aslan is a talented writer. His writing style is lively, interesting, and engaging.<br /><br />However, there are compelling pieces of historical evidence from studies of Jewish history and Roman history that cast serious doubts on his reconstruction of the events surrounding the crucifixion of Jesus.<br /><br />Background Information:<br /><br />The two most widely accepted dates for the crucifixion are Friday, April 7, AD 30 and Friday, April 3, AD 33. For example, in a book entitled Der Prozess Jesu, Josef Blinzler surveyed the written statements of approximately one hundred scholars regarding the date of the crucifixion and found that seventy seven of them supported either AD 30 or AD 33.<br /><br />There is not enough space in this book review to discuss all of the evidence that supports the AD 33 view. The following papers are easily available though and give some of the supporting arguments:<br />* tyndalehouse.com/tynbul/library/TynBull_1992_43_2_06_Humphreys_DateChristsCrucifixion.pdf<br />* biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/astronomy_fotheringham.pdf<br /><br />NASA (eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEhistory/LEhistory.html) also acknowledges Friday, April 3, AD 33 as a possible date of the crucifixion.<br /><br />The books and journal articles that support the AD 33 position include:<br />* Humphreys, Colin J.

Section 1 discusses events that are related to the Last Supper and the trial(s) of Jesus before the Sanhedrin. Section 2 discusses events that are related to Roman history and the trial of Jesus before Pontius Pilate.<br /><br />Section #1)<br /><br />Reza Aslan writes that:<br />* &quot;The story of that trial [before the Sanhedrin], as it is presented in the gospels, is full of contradictions and inconsistencies&quot; (Page 156)<br />* &quot;The next morning, the Sanhedrin hands Jesus over to Pilate to be crucified.&quot; (Page 157)<br />* &quot;The problems with this scene are too numerous to count. The trial before the Sanhedrin violates nearly every requirement laid down by Jewish law for a legal proceeding.&quot; (Page 157)<br /><br />If the AD 33 view is correct, then it is very likely that these assertions are flawed.<br /><br />Cambridge University Press published a book in 2011 that contains a detailed rebuttal of all of the points that are listed above. This book gives a detailed and convincing resolution of the &quot;contradictions and inconsistencies&quot; that Reza Aslan refers to. I recommend it highly to anyone who is looking for an opposing scholarly viewpoint.<br /><br />The book that I am referring to is:<br />Humphreys, Colin J. The Mystery of the Last Supper: Reconstructing the Final Days of Jesus. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011.<br /><br />It can be found on Amazon.com at:<br />[[ASIN:052173200X The Mystery of the Last Supper: Reconstructing the Final Days of Jesus]]<br /><br />A 30-minute MP3 presentation of the ideas in this book can also be found at:<br />cis.org.uk/upload/conferences/Residential2012/Colin_Humphrys.mp3<br /><br />The following summary is from the last chapter of this book by Humphreys:<br /><br />The solution given in this book is as follows.<br />* John places the last supper, the trials and the crucifixion of Jesus all before the official Jewish Passover meal. In John's account, Jesus died at the time the first Passover lambs were slain, at about 3 p.m. on the fourteenth day of the Jewish month Nisan.<br />* In Matthew, Mark, and Luke (the synoptic gospels), the last supper is a Passover meal. Jesus was therefore crucified after this Passover meal, on Nisan 15. Hence John and the synoptic gospels apparently disagree not only on whether the last supper was a Passover meal or not, but also on the date of the crucifixion.<br />* The solution to the above problems given in this book is that, in their description of the last supper as a Passover meal, Matthew, Mark, and Luke were using a different calendar to John. This book also identifies the different calendars used.<br />* The 'different calendar' I have identified that Jesus used to celebrate his last supper as a Passover meal was the pre-exilic calendar of ancient Israel. When the Judean Jews were in exile in Babylon in the sixth century BC they adopted the Babylonian calendar, including using Babylonian-style month names. This calendar was a lunar calendar, with a sunset-to-sunset day, and was the official Jewish calendar in the first century AD. Before this Babylonian-style calendar the Jews used an earlier, pre-exilic calendar.<br />* I have identified this ancient pre-exilic Jewish calendar as being based on the lunar calendar of ancient Egypt, but with the first month changed to the spring (called the month of Abib, meaning ripening ears of barley). The name of this first month was later changed to Nisan when the Judean Jews were in exile in Babylon (Nisan being the Hebrew equivalent of the name of the Babylonian first month, Nisannu).<br />* This pre-exilic calendar was a lunar calendar with a sunrise-to-sunrise day, just as the ancient Egyptian lunar calendar had a sunrise-to-sunrise day. It persisted through to the first century AD and I have shown that it was used to calculate Passover by various groups, including the Samaritans, the Zealots and at least some Essenes. There would therefore have been nothing particularly unusual about Jesus choosing touse this calendar to celebrate his last supper as a Passover meal. It would be somewhat like a Christian today choosing to celebrate Easter according to the Julian calendar (as indeed I did when on holiday in Greece) rather than the Gregorian calendar (which I use when in England). We know from the Jewish historian Josephus that Samaritans, Essenes and Zealots all lived in Jerusalem in the first century AD.<br />* With the aid of an astrophysicist I have reconstructed both the official Jewish calendar and the pre-exilic Jewish calendar for the first century AD. Passover in the pre-exilic Jewish calendar was always a few days before Passover in the official calendar.<br />* From these calendar reconstructions we can identify the date of the crucifixion as Friday, April 3, AD 33, and the date of the last supper as Wednesday, April 1, AD 33.<br />* A Wednesday last supper goes against the widespread assumption that this was on a Thursday. However, Thursday is nowhere said to be the day of the last supper in the Bible. A detailed analysis of the gospels shows that they do indeed place the last supper on a Wednesday.<br />* A Wednesday last supper solves the problems outlined in Chapter 1 of this book. It explains what happened on 'lost Wednesday'. It solves the apparent discrepancy of John and the synoptics on the date and nature of the last supper. It allows sufficient time for all the events the gospels record between the last supper and the crucifixion. Finally, it means that the Jewish trials of Jesus were legal. Following the last supper on Wednesday evening/night, Jesus was arrested in the early hours of Thursday morning. The main trial by the Jewish Sanhedrin court was in the daytime on Thursday. They then met again early Friday morning to confirm the death penalty. This agrees with the Mishnah, which states that the Sanhedrin must only meet in the daytime and in capital cases it must meet again the next day to confirm its decision.<br /><br />In a scholarly review of Humphreys' book, Nicholas King writes, &quot;The great strength of his approach is that ... he uses all [of the] available evidence ... there is a case to answer here.&quot; (Heythrop Journal)<br /><br />In his review of Humphreys' book, I. Howard Marshall (Emeritus Professor of New Testament, University of Aberdeen) writes, &quot;Here, then, is a book that offers a new historical reconstruction of the evidence that must be taken very seriously indeed.&quot;<br /><br />If Humphreys' theory is correct, then Reza Aslan's contentions about the trial(s) before the Sanhedrin are simply mistaken.<br /><br />Incidentally, the same thing applies to the argument about &quot;The Death of Jesus, in Mark and John&quot; that appears in Chapter 2 of Bart Ehrman's book entitled &quot;Jesus, Interrupted&quot;. If Humphreys' theory is correct, then Ehrman's argument is also mistaken.<br /><br />Section #2)<br /><br />Aslan writes that:<br />* &quot;Many Jews in first-century Palestine strove to live a life of zeal, each in his or her own way. But there were some who, in order to preserve their zealous ideals, were willing to resort to extreme acts of violence if necessary, not just against the Romans and the uncircumcised masses, but against their fellow Jews, those who dared submit to Rome. They were called zealots. These zealots should not be confused with the Zealot Party that would arise sixty years later, after the Jewish Revolt in 66 C.E.&quot; (Page 41)<br />* &quot;If one knew nothing else about Jesus of Nazareth save that he was crucified by Rome, one would know practically all that was needed to uncover who he was, what he was, and why he ended up nailed to a cross.&quot; (Page 155-6)<br />* &quot;Jesus was executed by the Roman state for the crime of sedition. Everything else about the last days of Jesus of Nazareth must be interpreted through this singular, stubborn fact. So, then, one can dismiss the theatrical trial before Pilate as pure fantasy for all the reasons stated above.&quot; (Page 156)<br /><br />There is a major figure from Roman history that Reza Aslan's book never mentions, a person who likely had a profound impact on the trial of Jesus before Pontius Pilate. That person is Lucius Aelius Seianus (commonly known as Sejanus).<br /><br />I recommend the following journal article and the following Wikipedia article:<br />* Maier, Paul L. &quot;Sejanus, Pilate, and the Date of the Crucifixion.&quot; Church History. 37.1 (March 1968): 3-13.<br />* en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejanus<br /><br />Paul L. Maier (wmich.edu/history/directory/emeritus/maier.html) was the Russell H. Seibert Professor of Ancient History at Western Michigan University until June of 2011.<br /><br />The following is a brief summary of the information in the Wikipedia article:<br />Sejanus was the commander of the imperial bodyguard of Caesar Tiberius from AD 14 until AD 31. He was involved in a plot to slowly poison Drusus, the son of Caesar Tiberius, to death. (Or, at the very least, that is what Caesar Tiberius was led to believe about 7-8 years later.) Drusus died on September 13, AD 23. Sejanus then set to work on the task of isolating Caesar and was able to convince him to move away from Rome to Campania in AD 26, and then to the island of Capri. In AD CE, Sejanus began ordering the executions of senators and wealthy equestrians. By early AD 31, Sejanus was essentially the de facto ruler of the Roman Empire. It is unclear what happened to provoke Caesar Tiberius to take action, but at some point in AD 31, Caesar Tiberius decided that something needed to be done.<br /><br />Here is how the Wikipedia article describes what happened next:<br />&quot;On October 18, 31, Sejanus was summoned to a Senate meeting by a letter from Tiberius, ostensibly to bestow the tribunician powers upon him. At dawn he entered the Senate, but while the letter was being read Macro assumed control of the Praetorian Guard, and members of the vigiles led by Graecinius Laco surrounded the building. The senators at first congratulated Sejanus, but when the letter, which first digressed into completely unrelated matters, suddenly denounced him and ordered his arrest, he was immediately surrounded and escorted to prison. That same evening, the Senate convened at the Temple of Concord and summarily condemned Sejanus to death. He was led from prison and strangled. His body was cast onto the Gemonian stairs, where the crowd tore it to pieces. ... Although Rome at first rejoiced at the demise of Sejanus, the city quickly plunged into more extensive trials, as Tiberius relentlessly persecuted all those who could in any way be tied to the schemes of Sejanus or had courted his friendship. The Senatorial ranks were purged; the hardest hit were those families with political ties to the Julians. Even the imperial magistracy was not exempted from Tiberius' wrath. Arrests and executions were now supervised by Naevius Sutorius Macro. The political turmoil would continue until the death of Tiberius in 37, after which he was succeeded by Caligula.&quot;<br /><br />Also, Paul Maier quotes Philo as writing that, &quot;Tiberius . . . knew at once after Sejanus's death that the accusations made against the Jewish inhabitants of Rome were false slanders. ... And he charged his procurators in every place to which they were appointed to speak comfortably to the members of our nation in the different cities [i.e., Jews], assuring them that the penal measures did not extend to all but only to the guilty, who were few, and to disturb none of the established customs but even to regard them as a trust committed to their care, the people as naturally peaceable, and the institutions as an influence promoting orderly conduct.&quot;<br /><br />These events are relevant because:<br />* Pontius Pilate was nominated for the position that he held by none other than Sejanus himself.<br />* It is very likely that, given these circumstances, Pontius Pilate would have felt that his position was in jeopardy.<br />* It is very likely that the crucifixion of Jesus took place on April 3, AD 33, which was in the middle of all this turmoil.<br /><br />Here is how Paul Maier describes the situation:<br />&quot;Now the vulnerable and defensive posture of Pontius Pilate on Good Friday makes immediate sense. Obviously, he was one of the provincial governors who received the communication from Tiberius cited by Philo. Moreover, ever since late in 31, when news reached Palestine of the fall of his patron, Sejanus, Pilate had doubtless been living under his political sword of Damocles, wondering if the &quot;Tiberian terror&quot; in uprooting supporters of the fallen minister and murderer of the princeps' son Drusus would extend to the provinces. The fact that Pilate had probably not been in personal contact with Sejanus for the last six years likely saved him at the time, though he realized his now-vulnerable position and undoubtedly strove to show his loyalty to Tiberius while also adjusting to the new directives concerning the Jews. ... April of 33 would have been a mere sixteen months after news arrived in Palestine of the death of the praetorian prefect, so Pilate's position was still freshly vulnerable. He could not tolerate a Jewish appeal to Rome in the case of one, Jesus of Nazareth, since the complaint would undoubtedly be framed about the charge already presented at Pilate's tribunal: that Jesus had made treasonable claims to kingship. At a time when Tiberius was prosecuting adherents of Sejanus precisely under the rubric of maiestas-treason to state and emperor-the prosecution's threat in John 19:12 was masterfully barbed and weighted. Add to this Tiberius' direct order to his governors, cited by Philo, warning them to uphold Jewish customs and institutions. Furthermore, the threat was accurate even to the detail of what fate might be in store for Pilate if an appeal to Tiberius became necessary: &quot;If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend.&quot; He would be excluded from the inner elite governing circle of amici Caesaris, whose membership was reserved for senators and those equestrians, high in government service, who were specifically called to this status. Loss of the rank amicus Caesaris led to political and social ostracism, even suicide. Answering the immediate, compelling call of natural self-interest, Pontius Pilate, in his present, vulnerable position, had little choice but to capitulate. A threatened appeal which would have been meaningless on April 7, 30 A.D. was terribly formidable on April 3, 33.&quot;<br /><br />Paul Maier argues that if we take April 3, AD 33 as the date of the crucifixion and take the events of Roman history into account as well, then the account of trial before Pontius Pilate that appears in John 18:28 to John 19:16 makes excellent sense as it stands and should be taken at face value.<br /><br />According to John 19:6, Pilate said, &quot;As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.&quot;<br /><br />This is clearly inconsistent with Reza Aslan's argument that, &quot;Jesus was executed by the Roman state for the crime of sedition. Everything else about the last days of Jesus of Nazareth must be interpreted through this singular, stubborn fact.&quot;<br /><br />If the AD 33 view is correct and Paul Maier's interpretation of the historical evidence is correct, then it is quite possible that Reza Aslan's views about the trial before Pontius Pilate are mistaken. I think that this is very detrimental to the arguments in Reza Aslan's book because it has the potential to strike down the core principle that serves as the basis for the title of the book.<br /><br />In closing, there are compelling reasons to doubt Reza Aslan's historical reconstruction at the vital points that support his overall outlook. Therefore, the idea that Jesus was a &quot;zealot&quot; and was crucified for the crime of sedition should be treated with caution and circumspection.
1607066017|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this is a very good graphic novel: certainly above the industry standard.  However, it didn't quite live to the hype for me.  I'd read Y: Last Man which I, once again, found above average but not as great as the hype would have you believe.  I ordered Saga volume 1 shortly after hearing it had won a number of Eisner awards.  I liked it, and definitely intend to read volume 2 - I just wouldn't classify this as a \\"must read.\\"<br /><br />Vaughan's strength really seems to be in his dialogue and character development, both of which we get a lot of in Saga.  I am in my 20s and, of any comic writer out there today, I think Vaughan \\"gets\\" our generation the most.  Having said that, there was more than one moment in Saga where I felt that Vaughan was struggling to understand the motivations and personalities of the lead characters after only a handful of issues.<br /><br />I'll just briefly mention the premise, which another reviewer correctly stated is simply a cross of Star Wars and Romeo & Juliet.  Nothing new here, just a cross of two premises that were sure to work, but without originality.<br /><br />This book is good, especially if you like science fiction drama.  Be aware that the emphasis is less on the fictional world and action, more so on character development.  This book is really cheap, and only takes about an hour to read.  Why not buy it?

B00CO8TA4I|5.0|I hadn't built a computer in 7 years (think IDE ribbon cables & DDR1), but I've had newer laptops, a core 2 duo and an i5 sandy bridge. While you can't really compare desktop rigs to laptops, I sort of knew what to expect performance wise, a lot faster. I chose this processor after months of research, deciding between this, and the unlocked K version, and AMD's top-of-the-line bulldozer.<br /><br />Day to day, this thing handles just fine. Paired with an ASRock H87 Pro4 motherboard and 8GB of RAM, it starts Windows 8 in about 10 seconds with all the antivirus & apps starting with it, plus my impatient starting web browsers and email as soon as I can click on them. I haven't noticed any lagging, occasionally if I try to open 3 or 4 things at once at the same time, it will take a long moment then open everything up. I have encoded video while watching 1080P Netflix, and there was no stuttering. You can throw a lot at it<br /><br />Under load, like encoding video or playing games, it runs a bit hotter than I'm used to, but apparently normal for this chip. With stock cooling it goes no higher than 69C, locked up at 3.36GHz. I was able to play most games at mid to high settings (paired with a GTX 650 Ti BOOST) with no issues.<br /><br />I'm not big into overclocking, from my experiences it's a lot of trouble and risk for very, very marginal gain. I'm quite happy at it's stock clock + turbo boost.<br /><br />From my research, it's really no comparison to AMD, this specific processor beat's AMD's absolute fastest processor in almost every way, except at hardcore multi-threaded operations (which most programs don't utilize anyway). Cheaper intels sacrifice a lot of speed, while higher end processors jump way up in price. This is the best value for your money in my opinion.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Wow....my daughter-n-law suggested that I read this book and I'm glad that she did.  It was a very unusual book and it kept my interest.  I read it in about 3 days (I work and have other community activities that take up much of my time, so reading is something I have to fit in between it all).
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app makes it really hard to free yours news feed. I have only once been able to successfully get the news feed settings to open to change it to &quot;most recent&quot; rather than &quot;top stories&quot;. Every other time  I have tried to click on the settings wheel, it just takes me back to the top stories feed without opening up settings/options. Annoying and so far my experience with apps on the kindle fire HD is making me wish I'd gone for an iPad.

B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This is a must-see film for anyone who approaches spirituality with a healthy sense of humor. It's also a great companion if you're raising teens. The writing and performances are superb, and the Cat Stevens songs achieve that rare symbiosis with the material that only the greatest musicals usually achieve. This element is on a par with Leonard Cohen's songs throughout McCabe and Mrs. Miller, another wonderful picture.<br /><br />Robert McDowell, [...]

B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|This one is fun, but to slow for me I dont like how it gives you options to where to put the piece, i like it better when the block is just droping and you are able to twist and turn and direct where it falls. But this is entretainly is just to easy.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Enjoyed this book a lot!<br /><br />The plot is very interesting, some of the scenes really made my heartbeat faster.I couldn't put this book down.<br /><br />A serial time-obsessed killer to punish an entire family because they wasted time.The victims pay with they life and even money!<br /><br />The author is brilliant in the way he put in words every single detail of this book.<br /><br />This book gives you a lot of adrenaline , shock ,and action that promise to not let you put the book down until you finished it.<br /><br />Definitely I recommend it!
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|I would watch 'Harvey' whenever it would come out on TMC (Turner Classic Movies), but that isn't very often and it takes a LONG time before they show it again, so I thought &#34;Why not just buy it, forget about waiting for it to come out again!&#34;<br />I'm glad I did because I LOVE this classic movie! Beautiful!<br />For anyone who loves the old classic movies, you'll LOVE 'Harvey'!

B008JFURKG|5.0|Great film just miss Morgan Freeman.but any movie with Helen mirren. The most beautiful woman in the world can't be all bad.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Finally, a decent sci-fi film that's not pushing some thinly-disguised social agenda (like Avatar, for example).  Plot was engaging and original without being overly complicated. Nice little twist at the very end (not giving it away). True, you sort of saw it coming, but you weren't 100% sure until the final scene.  Critics were merciless with Morgan Freeman and I don't know why; they used terms like \\"sleep-walking\\" or \\"just collecting his check\\".  The fact is, his character was purposely understated in the plot and not the prime focus of the film anyway -- sort of a transitional but still key character none the less.<br /><br />I LOVED that little jet-copter-thingy Cruise flew throughout much of the film -- way too cool! Kinda reminded me of that cool car he drove in the film Minority Report.  Whenever Tom Cruise is on the screen you can be assured there'll be plenty of cool gadgets & high tech stuff.<br /><br />If you like solid sci-fi sans the soppy social messages, then I think you'll enjoy this film.

B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Works just like advertised.

B008HK3XU4|5.0|The Marware standing case for my new kindle fire is terrific.  The pad fits snuggly into the case and is always protected when in use.  Because the case allows me to prop the kindle in an upright position, reading is a breeze.  I would recommend this case to other kindle owners as it not only protects the pad, but it also allows me to read with the pad propped in a variety of upright positions.

No, I don't want to promote your sad excuse of a game to my Facebook friends'. No, I don't want to give you five star review for in-game bananas. You're lucky I don't report you to Amazon and Google for violating their game development rules.

0064471837|5.0|I was recently introduced to Garth Nix as an author by my ten year old son. He had just finished the Keys to the Kingdom series and thought I might enjoy it. In the weeks since, I have been tracking down and devouring every Nix book that I can. As a lifelong Fantasy nut, I can't believe that it has taken me so long to discover his work, and him a home town hero and all.<br /><br />The entire Old Kingdom Chronicles are beautifully written and engaging, but it is this, the first book that sets the scene for all the wonders that follow. The character of Sabriel is built very carefully, allowing us to celebrate her strengths and empathise with her weaknesses. Cheering her on as she conquers her fears, as if we were battling our own demons alongside her.<br /><br />The best part about this book, is that I found it and have now shared it with my son. He is currently happily lost in The Old Kingdom. I hope we get to revisit it together one day. Thank you very much Mr Nix.<br /><br />Alison. Canberra

1623360277|5.0|I have read all the reviews posted here on Amazon on this book, \\"The Starch Solution\\" written by Dr John McDougall, and a synopsis of the book. I've not read the entire book, but have it on hold at the library to pick up in a few days.<br /><br />I've read Dr Mark Hyman's books, \\"The Sugar Solution\\", \\"The Sugar Solution Cookbook\\", and his book, \\"Ultrametabolism\\".<br /><br />All of these books are filled with great research based information. To eat starches makes complete sense to me. They are very filling and satisfying, especially since including meat in one's diet is being discouraged more and more.<br /><br />There's another great book, \\"In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto\\" by Michael Pollan. Something he says in his book is \\"Eat food, not too much, mostly plants.\\"<br /><br />For all these books, and many more books on \\"healthy nutrition\\", whatever that may be, there are tons of positive reviews and testimonials. I'm no doctor, no scientist, nor am I a nutritionist. In fact I have really no credentials for making this statement, other than books I've read and life experience, but I think when it's all said and done, we're going to find out that those who ate, in moderation, vegetables and fruits, nuts and seeds, whole grains, mostly low-fat dairy, if desired, got sufficient amounts of essential nutrients, ate lean meats/other healthy proteins, drank water, maybe some green tea, stayed away from foods treated with pesticides and the GMOs, ate sensibly, practiced portion control, exercised/led, at the minimum, a semi-active lifestyle, got proper amounts of rest, sleep, relaxation and had enjoyable times in life, essentially controlling stress as best one can, had a few good relationships, and practiced spirituality, limited couch time and screen time, are going to be the ones with the least amount of health issues.<br /><br />That's not easy to do with a fast food joint or two on every corner, but cooking is really not hard to do especially if you can get a jump on the coming week's healthy meals on the weekend, or other days off. Do some batch cooking, eat a healthy breakfast whether at home or on the go, limit the processed foods from fast food restaurants, and that end up in your grocery cart. The way I started limiting processed foods was to add more fresh/frozen veggies/fruits. Add a few more servings each week and eventually there's not much room left on your plate or in your \\"on-the-go/lunch box\\" type meals for processed junk. Food is expensive. Maybe growing a few things in some pots, or the flower bed would be an option to help defray the cost some.<br /><br />Best of luck to everyone with getting healthy eating habits established. This may not be the place to post this, but I just felt moved to post it anyway. These are simple, back to basic moves that have worked for me.
B008JFUPZI|1.0|*This is a review of the movie itself, and not the blu-ray and/or features included.*<br /><br />I had heard only bad word of mouth about R.I.P.D., but I like Jeff Bridges, Ryan Reynolds and Mary Louise Parker, so I convinced myself everyone else was just sour and that it'd be an okay movie.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />It's hokey; the CGI is awful; they do a horrible job trying to explain the mythology of their concept; there's no chemistry between any of the actors; every \\"twist\\" you see coming from a mile away- it's just top to bottom awful. I wouldn't even recommend it for kids- there are better movies they can spend their time on. I would definitely pass.

1401216676|2.0|Well I don't usually do reviews but this is an exception and you'll see why. (this goes mostly to anyone living outside the U.S.A)<br /><br />Well the comic is pretty amazing. I'm pretty new to comics but I thought this was a nice way to start.<br /><br />The thing is that I'm reading the comic and when I reach the middle of it I notice the Ink is pretty messed up so I asked through the chat for a way to replacement (no complains about the customer service) so I told the guy  I  am not a U.S citizen and that I have never lived in the U.S.A. (I live in Costa Rica) Long story short I can only get a refund and I loose the money I paid to the courier (It wasnt that much but what if the item had weighted 8 Kg in the worst case scenario, well I would have lost around 80 dollars and so forth). I get to keep the defective comic though. So if your buying outside the U.S.A keep this in mind. specially if you live in a country like mine.

B00CW7KK9K|5.0|When I started looking into an activity tracker, this caught my eye. It was between this and the Fitbit One. All things being equal, I like the pulse-taking option, and did not need the silent alarm, so I went with the pulse. I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that there seems to be a quality control issue in production. The first pulse I had would last a maximum of 4 days before needing to be recharged. After contacting customer service, and trying a few more charge cycles with it, they determined it was defective, and sent me a brand new one. I've had it since Sunday, and so far it has not needed a new charge. Each time I have sent them a question, they have gotten back to me within a day or two, so their excellent customer service makes up for the minor frustration of more frequent charging.<br /><br />I find it to be pretty accurate with my steps. I drove out of town recently, about 1.5 hours and found that it only added 30 steps or so, which I think is pretty good. So far wearing the clip, it has not fallen out anywhere. I put it in my pocket without the clip depending on what I'm wearing, and have had no problem with it falling out there either since it has a rubbery exterior. The sleep band is pretty comfortable to wear to bed as well. It is not 100% accurate with sleep, but it seems to do pretty well. I.E. when I wake up in the morning, I don't always press the button right away and it doesn't always show that I've woken up.<br /><br />ETA: I forgot to mention the syncing! When I first got it, I wasn't leaving bluetooth turned on to my tablet, and would do a manual sync each day. Worked just fine turning the bluetooth on and off. I thought this might be contributing to my battery issue (it wasn't), so I leave bluetooth on and now it syncs automatically throughout the day. I love it because I don't even have to think about it. Also, I take my pulse every day since I got the device and I have only had one time where it couldn't get a reading, so 29/30 is my experience with the pulse feature.<br /><br />All in all, I think the device itself is excellent. I appreciate how much work they are doing to make their customers happy, and can't wait for the advertised integration with MFP!
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I have had this case for a couple of months and have not had any problems with it. It works well and is so far very durable. I would recommend this to someone who wants a simple case for their kindle.
B003MWHVLY|5.0|Her unique talent and outstanding range came to full bloom in this album.<br />Love it - can't wait for more work from her!
B00005YW4H|5.0|She is a great singer and her songs are great ever. Especially if you travel a lot, you should get it one.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I was looking for inspiration and understand about complex subjects that can help heal the mind and trsnsform the life. Everyone should read this book.

B008C0C1Y8|3.0|Judge Dredd is the first official attempt to bring the oddball British comic digest 2000 AD to the big screen, with Sylvester Stallone starring as the magazine's most visible character, Judge Dredd. This film is based heavily on the earlier Judge Dredd comics of the 70s and early 80s, and marries ultraviolent action to deadpan humor and oddball camp. Judge Dredd's evil twin brother Rico escapes from prison and plots to replace the council of judges (who de-facto run Megacity 1 by enforcing its laws) with his own patsies. Rico organizes Dredd's exile from the city, and Dredd must sneak back in against the efforts of his fellow judges and Rico's fearsome ABC warbot to bring his perp brother to justice. So far so good.<br /><br />Judge Dredd also nails the universe of the comics pretty much spot on. The film's setting Megacity 1 is a ridiculous hodgepodge metropolis that seems to straddle apocolyptic squalor with bands of oblivious luxury. It is jammed with buildings and dwellings and is generally quite silly but nobody who has read the comic will miss what it is meant to be. The judges look pretty great too- the post-fascist metal eagles, chains, and other crazy motifs that bedeck their uniforms and bikes are faithfully reproduced here (the judge uniforms were custom made by Versace and supposedly account for a nontrivial part of the film's huge budget). The hellish wastes of the Cursed Earth are also represented and they are appropriately desert-ey and cannibal-filled.<br /><br />At this point you may be wondering what everyone's problem with this film is, and the answer is Judge Dredd himself. Not to put too fine a point on it, but Stallone is nothing like Dredd. He spends most of the film helmetless, romances a pretty lady cop, and has Rob Schneider as a comedy sidekick- in other words, he's just doing Demolition Man again, without the benefit of the equally bananas Wesly Snipes. And that's just no good- Judge Dredd is a heartless, stoney, unflinching justice machine who is so far from human emotion that he once gave up his orphaned neice because he worried her love for him would make him less ruthless. And he NEVER takes off his helmet.<br /><br />The end result is that while Judge Dredd is a competent film, and maybe even a decent Judge Dredd film, it is an AWFUL movie ABOUT Judge Dredd, if that distinction makes any sense.<br /><br />PROS<br />-Lavish effects and solid action sequences.<br />-Excellent depiction of Megacity 1.<br />-Captures the atmosphere of early Dredd comics.<br /><br />CONS<br />-Depiction of Dredd himself is pretty lacking.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|I thought the trailer for this movie looked awesome. However, trailers are often deceiving.  I came into the movie as a SciFi fan, not a Tom Cruise fan.<br /><br />I checked the Rotten Tomatoes rating and the overall Amazon rating.  Coupled with the great price for the HD version, I decided to try it out.  I was hoping for the best, but expecting the worst (I am still stinging from losing two hours of my life watching Cloud Atlas).  I really enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />Good story, good action, great special effects.  It's not a top 10 movie for me (or even top 50), but it was well worth the watch.<br /><br />I was curious why many people gave it a bad review and why it didn't do well in the theater.  I saw review titles mentioning plot holes and such.  For fear of ruining the enjoyment I had already received watching this movie, I didn't read those bad reviews.  I will catch continuity errors and plot holes in some movies, but not all, and those elements must not have been as apparent in this movie as others.  Ignorance is bliss in this case.
B000ICXQOM|2.0|It must be a guy thing, because I just did not find this movie amusing. It was over-the-top and ridiculous - and my feeling this way angered my husband greatly.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Suspenseful, exciting, funny!  A must read for everyone. I wish Durant was a real place and hopefully someday I will visit Wyoming just based on Craig Johnson's Longmire
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I loved this movie, the music was fun, the script witty - a great girls night flick to be enjoyed with a cocktail and popcorn in one's jammies.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|I mean, really ,can the acting get any worse? Stallone looks like he's going to explode from steroids. It's Stallone & friends making some money.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|This is a great movie, both adult and kid entertaining. It's a fun filled adventure for all. Highly recommend this movie.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My family watched the movie and had a lot of fun.<br />Kids loved the story very much.<br />I highly recommend it.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Harry Bosch is so very good at what he does! There's always a twist in all these books. Well worth reading for anyone looking for a series!
0525478817|5.0|This book is an absolute must-read. John Green has such a gift with words and this book will appeal to readers of all ages. It is a deeply emotional read that is also quite funny.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Evernote would not sinc and then ALL of my entries were deleted.  So I uninstalled it from my phone and Kindle.

0064471837|5.0|This has been one of my favorite books for over 10 years. Garth Nix has created a fantasy world so unique and relatable! An amazing novel about a teen girl finding her true path through adventure, danger, and love. It also teaches that being different can be a great thing. I have never loved a series so much in my entire life! I am proud to say I named my daughter after the courageous heroine, Sabriel!
B000W9179M|3.0|Rambling story about wife and her journey. Didn't really like it. Maybe someone else will enjoy it. I really didn't, but I like most of the authors books so tried it.
B0061S0A64|4.0|It's an interesting experimental music creator. Fun to create looping tracks with. It consumes battery life like nothing else though, but that may be all processor power.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I REALLY LOVE THIS BOOK, FROM START TO FINISH..IT WAS GOOD, AS FOR HAZEL AND AGUSTUS, STAR-CROSSED LOVE....IT WAS FUNNY, SAD AND WELL A LITTLE HEART CRUSHING
B00CDY6HW6|3.0|Gameplay is a little slow and the game gets repetitive quickly.  Fast forward mode is helpful, but I find that I need to play on that mode normally to enjoy what I'm doing. Once I have the puzzle solved, the wait for the bunnies to cross the entire map is just too long.  Large maps also lag my phone (A Galaxy Note 2).
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|GOOD BOOK, LITTLE SLOW BUT ITS REALLY SCARY HOW TRUE THE LOVE THING IS, ITS TRUE CAN'T LIVE WITH IT CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|We were ready to stop the movie about 20-25 minutes in but, thankfully, we didn't. The movie takes awhile to establish the characters but soon it finds it's footing and lands in a good middle-of-the-road spot. Chances are the next movie will be better now that the characters are established.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Handy to have with me anywhere.  I like that I can find the weather in any location at any time.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|That is all I can say. But I have to type more for Amazon to allow my comment. Boring, Boring.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My Kid loves it, he is hooked on the game, and its an appropriate one for a 6 yr old
B00005MP58|5.0|Don't even bother with the movie theater version of this movie, as it was a waste of time.  However, this production is outstanding.  I watch it at least once a year and have shared it with many friends who agree that it is a great adaptation of P&P and also just a fantastic movie .. can't stop once we start it!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|i have this app for my kids pretty cool, very entertaining, low maintenance and easy to play for my kids
B00821OX98|5.0|Just started watching it, after seeing alot of commercials for it on tv im like ok let me check it out while i'm waiting for walking dead to come back i gotta say i'm luvin it!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Fast paced with a great twist at the end. I look forward to reading the rest of the quintet.  Enjoy.
B00C5WR6JE|2.0|I found this a very disappointing CD from such a talent - I would not recommend this album to anyone
B008OM0EDO|1.0|Complete waste of time.  Tasteless and not worth the effort to watch it.  For your sanity don't get this movie.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Anyone who remembers the 60s and the eagles will love this. Very informative and entertaining at the same time. Love this group.
B004J64QSI|5.0|An outstanding stage production of Les Miz with incredible voices and staging. Much better than the movie - visually and musically.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was skeptical about how well this device would work.  It plugged right up to my LG HD TV and the install worked as it should with no trouble (that's rare).  I love it, it works perfectly.  What more could you want?
1885167776|4.0|I shouldn't be taking time away from my &#34;one thing&#34; to write this, but it might be helpful to others.<br />This book is not earth shaking, but it provides a good framework for getting a hold of the &#34;tasks&#34; and goals you have.  Like many self help type books, a lot of what is said has been said before, and could be said in a shorter book.  Still, the way the topic is presented is inviting, and it makes for easy reading.<br />To be fair to the authors and to get the most out of the book, it's a good idea to go through it twice and to take the exercises they present as far as you can go. Otherwise, it will sound good but not translate into sustained action.<br />Now, back to the one thing...
B000XUBC5E|4.0|It was a real gripper, marvelously entertaining.<br />I would recommend this book to all those who love a good mystery.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Attempted to download app to my android Galaxy s4.  Would not load, and now I can't take it off the phone.  A completely useless exercise in frustration.
B0001I562I|5.0|Couldn't find this in stores so i knew Amazon had it. I was also to find other classics from my search recommendations. Its like reliving my childhood all over again! Watching the movie as an adult has different connotations associated with it now. Overall still a classic in my eyes
B0058VW36U|5.0|not too hard not too easy and om nom is so cute .on the main menu if you tap the candy you can make it a cupcake or a donut instead. i also recommend pudding monsters  :)
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I'm an old school rock musical fan from way back.  Heavy Metal, Rocky Horror, Yellow Submarine, The Wall and the like. (I saw Yellow Submarine on after-midnight TV by accident as a teenager and was amazed, lol)  My college age son turned me onto Daft Punk and this video a few months back, but only saw snippets online until now.  I read the complaints about the blue ray version, so went with the standard DVD.  I watched it for the first time last night end to end and I was VERY impressed.  The clarity and color of the animation has been called into question, and I couldn't disagree more.  This is a high quality production all around.  Maybe some folks are not familiar with Japanese animation, which is very different than what we are used to in the US.  I am not an expert, but I've seen a few other movie length Anime productions (ie. Metropolis) and this obviously is one of the more artistic and creative ones.  The scenes matched up with the music amazingly well and the ability of the animators to convey the story, expression and emotion with no dialog was outstanding.  You always know exactly what is going on throughout the story and there are very poignant scenes depicting joy, fear, panic, relief, grief and triumph, that keep you glued throughout.  Of course not every song is 'great' just like any album out there, but the story line keeps it all flowing which makes the music an even better experience.  I will finish with the fact that this is a movie you can comfortably watch with all ages, and its a wonderful addition to anyone's entertainment collection. Go for it!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I quit playing on Facebook last year because I didn't want to sit in front of the computer so long every day.  I was happy to find this as a Kindle app and now play every day again.  It's a fun way of passing time for a short while!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is a bit different from others I've played. Graphics are good and if you enjoy hidden object games this one may be good to try. If you follow the directions you can move through it with ease.
B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|interesting concept...movie was a little slow at the beginning but eventually picked up.  Unrealistic matrix-like scenes made the movie silly, but overall not too bad
B00992CF6W|4.0|FINALLY minecraft on the go the best game in town! GET THIS don't starve over the clones. The reason I rated an 4 is because when I chatted my kindle was in a black screen of death but fixed it but a great app!
B007T7MIR0|2.0|I found this to not be very user friendly.  I expected it to be more comparable to a Microsoft Word program.  Don't waste your money.Other programs that are much cheaper are comparable to this.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Great action movie with just enough humor from talented actors! Enjoyed the characters and look forward to seeing RED 2!
B00DH1G7DS|3.0|This app was the free app of the day, and I like sudoku, so I thought it was a bargain and it would be a good app, as it has fairly good ratings. So I got the app and I was confused at first because it has a weird set up. I figured it out and I thought I wasn't getting good times because if I got a number wrong and it added 30 seconds. Also, if you want to add a little number, instead of being able to touch the number and put all the little numbers in, you push the pencil, touch the square, touch the square and do steps 2 and 3 over and over, so I did a 4 minute puzzle and it took me 12 minutes. Not a good app, I would not recommend it. Instead I would get 10,000+ Sudoku.
B00DBSZT7C|1.0|Horrible plot. Special effects weren't bad. I want those minutes back from my life. It was such a Hollywood template movie. Wish it were better.
B004BCNVOA|5.0|I didn't have any of her earlier albums, so this was a &#34;perfect&#34; compilation. And that song rarely fails to make me cry.
B00821OX98|3.0|Series offers little explanation of how situation arose and leaves many unanswered questions about  what is going on beyond a frantic run for survival.  Audio quality/format varies with episodes.
B00DHNJ0I0|5.0|Colin Farrell and Noomi Rapace are excellent,  great story about revenge and what it costs to get it.  Saw it in the theater and couldn't wait for it to come out online
B002NNA9N0|5.0|There so many great performances in this film, including the great Jack Lemon as the desperate loser who must sacrifice his own principles, Al Pacino confident and apparently disinterested in the character failings of his co-workers and Alan Arkin who somehow manages to escape trouble in the end. But the Alec Baldwin scene itself is worth the price of admission. Confrontational and hilarious he reminds us of what a great talent he is...
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|If you liked Dear John, you will like this! Good story line with cute children in a support role. Loved the dog!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie so much with commercial breaks on TV.....I ended up buying this DVD. Witty, funny and very entertaining. In the mood for a romantic comedy... here ya go!
B004N868DS|5.0|This is the best mouse-pad I've owned. I will never go back to the soft ones except for light office use.<br /><br />I'll start by saying this thing is the right size for me and my desk.  I've had the small, crappy pads and they aren't very nice to use unless you're setting the mouse to an extreme DPI.  Likewise, I've tired some of the bigger ones and I found I never used all the real-estate they provided.  My desk could handle one of those huge keyboard, mouse, everything pads, but I see no need.<br /><br />This thing is solid as a rock.  It's obviously aluminum and rock solid.  The little rubber pads keep it planted.  It has two different sides but I notice minor differences.  I like using the 'control side' (the black picture).  The 'speed' side (the blue picture) works just as well, but it makes more noise so that was the deciding factor.  As a note about using both sides and I was worried if I wanted to use the speed side was the bright blue picture.  Every review, stock photo, etc. made this picture look like it'd keep a small village lit.  That's not the case, it's more tasteful and toned down than it seems.<br /><br />Also, I use my mouse at 800dpi (I think that's the setting, maybe 900?).  So, a bit lower than some but not the lowest.  This pad works very well at this setting.  I tried the lower DPI (400) and that worked well too.  I don't go above the lower DPIs on my mouse - I hate it.<br /><br />The tracking is superior as is expected.  I don't know how well a cheapy, 'included' mouse or some tiny $4 mouse would work, but I imagine if there were any tracking issues, it's the mouse and not this pad.<br /><br />The only downside to this set-up is the wrist rest.  Unlike some of the competition out there, it is a distinct item and you can use it or not.  I only use it for light office work, if I'm gaming or using photo-shop, I ditch it.  It's too small for me and to properly use it, I have to let it sit at an angle on the mouse pad instead of flat on the desk, otherwise it hurts my wrist.  I'll get a nicer one for office work at home.  It's not a deal-breaker at all as this mousepad is quite fine on its own and this is a good bonus if you like it or need it.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Keira Knightley and crew were wonderful in this movie. The more times you watch this the more you see.. My daughters even love this also, they are 15 and 17. If you have never watched a movie set in this era, I would sway you to get this. You may find yourself enjoying this and learning what life was like. Society status, society pressure, romance, humor and all in all fine performances from everyone involved. A great flix!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My Kindle Fire was telling me I had too many personal files (not apps), even though I had one small book and that was all.  I downloaded this cleaner and it showed a detailed breakdown of where everything was, how large it was, even gave me the option to move apps from one place to another.  HIGHLY recommended!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|It's becoming  more like a typical soap opera in season three.There are too many predictable plots. Basically growing more bored with the show
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I enjoyed &#34;Red&#34;.  Bruce Wills and his friends were great, very action pack, and the good guys wins.  Fun to watch.
B00AFEY7QO|5.0|Swing Out Sister is the most under-appreciated musical phenomenon of our time. Musically complicated and visually dynamic, this is a must for anyone with an appreciation for a smooth, sophisticated, contemporary sound.
B0007VZ9DU|5.0|DVD is exactly in the condition stated!<br /><br />Delivered as promised.<br />Great packing.<br />In condition stated - Excellent.<br />Cover Art in Great Condition - as stated.<br />DVD in Great and Playable condition - as stated.<br /><br />Thank you - Would/Will purchase from you again!
B009AMANH4|3.0|After having read many reviews in newspapers,I was anxious to see the movie when it became available on DVD. I was disappointed in the movie.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Sexy, hot, intense, violent and all around amazing. The parallel to Shakespeare is genius and the roles are so well acted. Hands down, one of the best shows on television. I would do dirty thigs to Kurt Sutter as repayment for this show. Dirty, dirty things.
B009GIPDQS|2.0|It has many boring parts, such as the scheme against the killer of the judge, which is a rather unrealistic story
1416955070|4.0|I picked this one up because it was free on Kindle a while back and because the trailer for the upcoming movie looked potentially fun. And the story is fun for the most part. The male lead is a great character, and the banter throughout is great. Many readers have commented on the plot's similarity to other popular YA books, but since I haven't ready most of them, I wasn't bothered by this too much.<br /><br />What did bother me was the Third Act. When Jace disappears from the story, most of the sizzle goes with him. And the twist in the end didn't excite me at all. SPOILER Clare has said that exploring the supposed sibling relationship between Jace and Clary was her initial inspiration for the book. And, in a different kind of book, this would indeed have been an interesting topic to explore. But, frankly, it's not what I wanted to read about in a fun YA adventure. I'll probably pick up the next book, but an exploration of some weird sexual energy between in-love teens pretending not to be in love because they think they're brother and sister when they're really not honestly doesn't excite me very much. END SPOILER<br /><br />Still, it was a fun read. 3 1/2 stars.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Required watching before the Avengers.  Good story that held our interest throughout.  The bad guys are predictable but it is a comic book after all.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I liked it. It reminded me of a cross between Harry Potter and Twilight. Brilliantly written with many characters and a great story line.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Still not sure that I liked the concept.  Will try the next book in the series, but the jury is still out.
B000FCKRDI|5.0|Loved reading the &#34;The Wallflowers&#34;. A very fun read.<br />Wished that it came in a bundle to get all of the books at one time.

0553375636|5.0|I've read other works by the same author and she's standing up to time. Very deep book requires thought and knowledge of previous story..
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Charges fast when you need a mobile charge.  There's not much more to say, it hasn't failed on me yet and i don't expect it to.  Nice quality also, unlike the apple cord, i wish apple would make their cord a bit more sturdy.
B0082Z447U|4.0|Having never heard of Wilkie Collins until I found an antique book of Literature's Giants at a thrift store, I determined to read his great novel.  At first it was a chore, but then the story began to pull on me and make me want to read the end.  I will admit that about 1/3 through the book I read the synopsis online. But I continued reading it because his writing, though of a style long gone from popularity, is of the type to enjoy it anyway.  My only disappointment is that he didn't realize the true woman of worth was Marion.
0345803485|1.0|I know this isn't fair, but hubby brought home the trilogy of Fifty Shades the other day which I'd only heard about. I flipped open the first book and tried to read..skipped a few pages more and finally put it back on the shelf. I guess I'll be donating it or maybe selling on Amazon. Is is just me that finds this silly? I guess I should have explored more..I never did find the juicy sex parts that some folks are raving about.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|Love this show!  Remember it well from when I was younger...just wish it was more than just the one season!?
0064471837|5.0|I read this book for the first time when I was in middle school over ten years ago, and have read a few more times since. It's a great story that was so unique to all the other books I have read and was the first book I had ever read by Garth Nix. Out of the books that came after, it is still my favorite. I love the character of Sabriel and I love the concept of magic and necromancy in this world. I would encourage anyone to read this one, young or not!
B001OR0AEY|5.0|This documentary has all the key ingredient  for great story- from human victory, rising from nobody to stardom accompanied by beautiful music and scenery that make it a must watch- highly recommend
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I like the way it plays needs better instructions on how to play but it still plays very well for me
0575056991|3.0|Here we see a great book, hilarious in nature, turned into a mediocre comic. It's not that the comic is bad, but that it doesn't hold up to the book. If you want to see Mort in all its glory, get the book
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This was truly the best season yet. The transformation of Tom Branson has been great to watch. I love the variety of emotions that are experienced in each episode. There is drama, suspense, grief, joy and the unparalleled wit of the Dowager is the icing on the cake. This is my favorite series ever.
B000I9X50U|3.0|Ive seen it several times. I dont even remember where the darn movie is now, i barely remember buying it :/ .
B003JUGQ38|5.0|My favorite season of Doctor Who. Donna was my favorite companion, loved their interactions and the fact that they were \\"mates\\" but always mistaken for a couple. :) Could watch it over and over.
B003UYV08E|5.0|I love Iron Man straight up, all the movies just three seems alittle off to me but i would watch it again either way. Ty.

B005544TRQ|5.0|Liked that Loved this, I can hardly wait for the next season, I even bought the first episode of the next season.
B00B2GK4KW|4.0|It s good, I like it much. Is easy, simple and the efecct is amazing. I recomend it? Enjoy !
B009NX61JY|4.0|As a Barbra fan, this was an interesting and well presented perspective on the ways in which we all trip over our own emotional feet. Barbra has a great sense of humor and a remarkable serious side as well, so I found it very enjoyable.
B005QYKD4I|4.0|My family enjoyed it! Kept us engaged the whole time. Good storyline and the acting was pretty good too. I would recommend it if you like action flicks.
B0094LUH4A|5.0|As it happens, this is a real favorite of mine: a story that walks one through a piece of American history not often well portrayed except, perhaps, in documentaries. Also, as it happens, a piece of personal history, so the fact that it rings true to my ear is all the more satisfying. The love story is a great vehicle for the historical and cultural look-see at what America was like in &#34;the good old days.&#34; As a true romantic, the love story has the bitter-sweet tang of reality and never fails to raise a well-deserved tear or two. And, of course, Robert Redford's understated performance creates the perfect backdrop for Barbara's fireworks personality. They play beautifully (literally) off of each other's strengths and provide credibility in what might otherwise have been an awkward story. The supporting cast is fabulous and the music needs no praise from me. The writing brings time and circumstance into the present and the director's and editor's sensitivity to subject matter and story are reflected in a classic film. Works for me . . .
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|It is a bittersweet movie with very small bits of comedic interludes. Good acting by some of the cast- others not so much.
B000IZA9OE|5.0|If you like South Park and don't mind humor that goes way over the line you will love this movie.  They make fun of everyone and everything in this movie so if you are easily offended it may not be for you!  Totally crude, totally ridiculous, totally over the line.....totally amazing :)
B0055OK2T0|3.0|Ho Hum.  Moves slowly.  Plot weak and improbable.  Suggest you pass on this one, as there are better alternatives available.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I thought it would be impossible for Hosseini to top his  other books, but in my opinion he did.  At times the various story lines were confusing.  The stories all related in the end and I think this book is complex enough in themes and symbols to merit from a second reading.  The characters were all very human, multi dimensional and evoked empathy.  Although the ending was sad, it was hopeful and poignant. I loved this book more than any I have read in quite a while and would highly recommend it to anyone who liked his other books.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Exquisite cinematography, period costumes and decor.  The story is compelling and historically accurate.  The acting is fabulous as well.  Maggie Smith delivers her lines flawlessly.....
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|It is brilliant! Speilberg's vision is exact, precise.  I thought I got to know Lincoln.  Daniel Day Lewis was Lincoln.  I lived through the agonizing moments of the loss of his son, his wife's sanity, Tad's loneliness.  Sally Field should have received the Oscar.  Her inability to find closure just poured out and teared every eye.  More more more . . ..
B009ZQJ0ME|3.0|Enjoyable and well acted.  Plot seems to develop slowly.  Not really type of movie that I would see as pay per view.
B00127RAJY|4.0|You know Jillian, right? She certainly knows what to say. I liked the three workouts, 30 mins each. I travel often for work and this DVD gives me an opportunity to exercise in my hotel room. I would recommend it for those who travel to use it as a great workout on the road.
B00499QUK2|5.0|After Jeremy Brett's Sherlock, Benedict is amazing!<br /><br />The sherlock show Elementary on CBS is dull and boring!  BBC needs to make more of this series!
B000050XEI|5.0|Music is very soothing.  I heard it in a restaurant and just had to have it.  More people should buy.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This is a fun game where you decorate a ball. Sounds odd but it's alot of fun and a little addicting. Starts out very simple but quickly gets more challenging. There are about 50 balls and I haven't gotten through it all yet but I'm sure I'd like to go through it again. I guess you would call it a logic game cause you have to really think through some of the problems. Definitely good for teens through adults.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|What a voice the music is so relaxing.  I heard it play in a restaurant and had to have it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have really enjoyed Downton Abbey and it various twists and turns.  It always leaves you wondering what is next.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The third season of Downton Abbey is excellent with a cliffhanger ending. I enjoyed every single minute of the season.
0316201545|5.0|I just finished reading \\"The Land Of Stories: The Enchantress Returns\\" and I still have a smile on my face! I really, really loved this book, and thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Following I'll share my thoughts with you - there are a few *very* minor spoilers in this review, but nothing I would consider to be especially plot-relevant!<br /><br />About the story:<br /><br />It's been a year since twins Alex and Conner Bailey were magically transported into the Land Of Stories and went on a quest to put together the Wishing Spell to find a way back to their own world. A year since they found out that they are children of both worlds, and that their grandmother is the one and only Fairy Godmother.<br /><br />But adventure awaits the Bailey twins again when their mother is kidnapped and taken to the fairytale world by an evil enchantress who wants to rule over all the kingdoms - and more. Together they travel back to the Land Of Stories, where they soon find out that another quest is in order. Only this time, they're not alone! They are joined by an unlikely quartet, and together this group must find a number of hard-to-collect items in hopes of putting together the Wand of Wonderment - the one thing that might help them defeat the enchantress and save the world!<br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I really enjoyed the first book in the series, \\"The Wishing Spell\\", and thought it was good - but I also felt that it still left room for improvement (as is often the case with books by first time authors). Naturally I was excited for the sequel, \\"The Enchantress Returns\\", and the book did not disappoint! In fact, I have to admit I actually liked this one better than the first one ... :o)<br /><br />Chris Colfer has really taken leaps and bounds as an author. I mean, he was a good writer and storyteller to begin with, but I feel that his writing has still improved quite a bit since his first book (\\"The Enchantress  Returns\\" is actually his third one, with the YA novel \\"Struck by Lightning: The Carson Philips Journal\\" - based on his own screenplay - being the second).<br /><br />The story is more well-rounded, the pacing and plotting tighter, the writing itself smoother, there's more depth to both story and characters, and he manages to effortlessly interweave various subplots and tie them all up neatly in the end. While I felt that the story was a bit slow in the beginning, it soon picked up pace and once Alex and Conner were back in the Land Of Stories there was not a dull moment to be found.<br /><br />Chris Colfer's vivid imagination and knack for drawing readers into his stories continues to amaze me! His writing is incredibly descriptive and imaginative, and just like with the first book, this one too felt like I was watching a movie in my head (and on that note I have to say that both TLOS books would make really awesome movies!).<br /><br />He is good at writing scenes for Alex and Conner, but where he is really at his best is when writing his fairytale characters, and especially when creating their back stories. He takes these stories and characters we all know and adds a whole bunch of new layers (and a lot more depth) to them. And more than that - he makes them feel so real they seem to leap off the pages!<br /><br />There is plenty of humor and witty banter in this book! Mother Goose - or should I say \\"Mother Booze\\"? - is hilarious, and I have to say I love Chris for basically forcing Red and Goldilocks to spend the majority of the story in close quarters - their constant open animosity makes for some of the book's most funniest moments! In fact, those two might just be my favorite characters in the series ... :o)<br /><br />It is really good to see Chris continuously improve as a writer, and honestly? If the three novels he has published so far are any indication then we can expect some really big things from him in the future!<br /><br />To sum this up, \\"The Enchantress Returns\\" is a wonderful and well-written book not just for children - or adults - who love fairytales and fantastical stories, but for anyone who enjoys reading about adventures full of magic, wit and humor. I really hope that there will be more books in the series because I'm definitely not ready to say goodbye to Alex, Conner, and all the fairytale characters yet!<br /><br />About the audio book: I read the hardcover book first and then listened to it after that. I'm not generally a fan of audio books but Chris Colfer always narrates them himself - and that is an absolute treat! He always manages to give every character  a unique voice of their own, and I found his narration to be funny, engaging and often endearing!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|would quit chewing the damn thing.  I have to order another one... my third in less than a month.  Jeez
B008VVT51U|4.0|This wasvavvery good movie the acting was well done, however it was a bit  slow moving at times. The insight into  living in  India made it very interesting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 5 year old son loves this game, and so do I.  The fact that he love this despite there not being any violence makes it even better.  I do wish there were more instructions regarding how to achieve the various items/points and what all the different winnings mean for the game.
B003L77G06|5.0|brand new! for a really cheap price.<br />I'm going to keep buying the other seasons of modern family from here.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book grabbed me right from the beginning. Love the characters, good and evil, love the details, love the ups and downs. I'm already on book three!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is too AWESOME! I have quite a few jewels game and this one is one of my favorites! Just love I. It's really fast plus each step gets harder!<br /> Get this game. You won't be sorry. I promise.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|a wonderfully done rendition of the cruel realities of slavery in this country. a priceless ending!  violence & other inhumanities
B002PLALCO|5.0|Wish I could actually have seen this tour live! It looked so alive and fun and entertaining I'm glad I bought it. The music is phenomenal and any P!NK fan would love this DVD!
B003UYUP58|5.0|This was a very well written book. Cancer from scientific, historic and humanistic viewpoints. I also listened to it on Audible, and the narration was excellent.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Great band! Bought the other albums of theirs and they vary widely but yet they have the same melodic rhythm to them, I just can't stop listening to In This Moment lately.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I'd played this a few yrs ago &amp; wasn't sure I'd want it on my tablet. Downloaded the free app &amp; I'm hooked again!
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|The actors have been well chosen in the whole series. Of course without Tom Selleck it wouldnt have been nearly as good. I enjoy coastal scenery and a good old New England accent. Easy and fun to watch and follow.
0061673730|5.0|Read first 40 years ago in the 60's, the message about the approach and our journey through life remains timeless.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|I thought this would work with my HP printer but it goes to some print/copy shop near me some place I never heard of...
B00BNWWUDY|5.0|really enjoyed the journey in the movie, well thought out and written, good acting and well presented, would watch it again
0064471837|5.0|I love Sabriel and the Abhorsen series since a friend introduced it to me back in high school.<br /><br />Sabriel is an amazing adventure and shows how a young woman must adapt to the situations around her, rather than trying to plan her whole life. It's an amazing, empowering adventure to follow Sabriel (to imagine you're her) and see her push herself to save everyone as she learns more about the Old Kingdom that she knows so little about.<br /><br />This is an inspirational novel, one that teaches us that life doesn't go the way we want it, but that doesn't mean that we can't do something important and become someone important.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|a view of history and human events all all levels, vey enertaining an the acting is surperb, five stars all the way
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was the best few hours I have spent in a long time playing a game. It is beautiful and just complex enough to be thrilling.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Told a complex and important story reasonably well. Abe seemed hoked-up a little, lines at times evoked a bit of  Walter Brennan in an apparent effort to evoke folksiness, but overall acting quite good along with production values. The script had to be a challenge, involving not a single police chase or teen in distress, and succeeded very well. Seemed at times like a stage play.
0307588343|5.0|This is how you feel when you read this book. The sheer enormity of how the global financial system came to the brink of disaster due to the failure of one financial organization is near impossible to comprehend.<br /><br />Written like a financial whodunit, with extensive human depiction of every single character who gave everything they had to prevent the senior-most leadership from driving this historic organization into financial ruin, this book is nothing short of a masterpiece for anyone who has a burning desire to understand the underlying reasons for the once-in-a-lifetime event of the crash of 2008, just about five years ago.<br /><br />This book rewinds back to the very early beginnings of Mr. McDonald's background, and paints a vivid picture of his beliefs, values, and fire that made him arrive at Lehman, his association with mentors, peers, and associates at so many different levels, the intense respect he has for each of them and why, and the day to day workings on the trading floor where history was in the making. It is this very content, the style in which it is written and the richness of its content is what pulls you into it, and before you know it, you are right there in the middle of the action, feeling every pulsing moment as it unfolds.<br /><br />One wonders what it would be like to have been in those shoes as all the events that led the firm there unfolded, the discovery, the scale of the misdeeds, the numerous futile attempts to stop the train wreck in the making, the ultimate changeover of power, and even after that, the desperation to save the company by the valiant leaders who were initially shunned.<br /><br />An inside story, this is an emotional journey into the hearts and minds of the people who lived through the entire saga of Lehman Brothers.<br /><br />AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ.
1885167776|2.0|I read THE ONE THING and it is a well-crafted book.  I didn't need to use my yellow highlighter on it because the authors (or some graphic artist) underlined passages throughout on the text--as though the reader did it. The text is well-executed with summary bullet points at the end of each chapter and graphically pleasing with pull quotations.<br /><br />Here's my reason for giving this book two stars on Amazon. The authors get commended for their execution but not their content.  The contents are little but worn phrases and clich&eacute;s that anyone who has read a business book in the last ten years has probably already heard. I found little new.  You can skip this one in my view.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I waited out the initial excitement, not wanting to add yet another tv show to my queue, but Downton Abbey I'd INCREDIBLE!!! A must watch!
B004SOR4H6|1.0|hard to access at busy times of the day. hard to navigate pages, many enjoyed features not available...ie pdq. The days the paper is delivered it is confusing and difficult to find stories and puzzles
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This is a very well-written story about someone who you would not expect to be in prison.  She has told her story and given us an unusual perspective on our penal system with some interesting suggestions for improvement. She takes responsibility for her own actions which put her there, but because of her background and education can see that there is a revolving door in some cases and useless programs in other cases. She has some valid points that need addressing.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|It's worth a watch if you're a fan of the Alien series, but the plot isn't always completely clear and the story raises more questions than answers.  I hope a sequel that's well done will be released since I think there's lots of room for good storytelling in the Alien universe, especially in the span of time set between Prometheus and the first Alien film.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a very good read, an interesting perspective about the hierarchy among the slaves and their interaction with the family they serve.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|I got this app on the day when it was free, because I don't usually spend money on apps. The reviews said it was fun so I gave it a try. I immediately was addicted and it is now my favorite game to play. I reccomend this to anyone who likes puzzle games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome games they are really easy to compleate fun cool some are boring some are fun some are hard but I would recomend this game
B002SKZBQS|5.0|Another winner! I enjoyed this book very much. I've read practically all of Stephen Kings books. Can't wait for the next one!!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I enjoy the 1st season.  The only problem is the 3rd DVD is scratched and I have to fast forward past the bad places.  Evidently Amazon doesn't have very good quality control.
B007PVHANM|5.0|I bought the DVD for my brother-in-law who had heard about the movie from friends.  He checked all the Red Boxes in town and couldn't find it to rent, so I bought the  DVD so he could have one of his very own.  He absolutely loved the movie and repeatedly watches the DVD.  The DVD arrived on time.
030758836X|5.0|This was an amazing twisting, crazy book.  I absolutely loved reading it.  A real page turner!!!  But i don't think there should be a word total requirement for these surveys.
B008602KQI|5.0|A little different if you read the book first but I still really enjoyed it. The main focus of the book was really captured in the movie. Can't wait until the second movie comes out.
0439023513|3.0|This was a pretty predictable book--plot and ending was exactly what I expected.  In general, the Hunger Games, was an interesting concept, but got old fast.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed both seasons 1 and 2 and found myself watching episode after episode late into the night.  This is addictive!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This book continues the story line, fills in some of the back story, and rounds,out the &#34;imp&#34;. It is an enjoyable read, and it is worth reading.
1609611543|5.0|It's very eye opening to hear what effect wheat , gluten have on people. The book was a little wordy with a lot of case trial results but, extremely informative. I realized I do have an allergy to gluten. Highly recommend the book.
B006QQQ5SI|4.0|Very enjoyable! Tells the story of 3 birders dedicating the year to birding. Excellent character development of the 3 birders, who although are very different, share a love of birding. Sometimes competitive, sometimes collegial, always entertaining. A fun movie.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|SO EASY TO USE.TOOK A MINUTE TO LEARN EVERYTHING AND MAKE GOOD PICTURES BETTER NOT SO GOOD LOOK BETTER.BEST APP SO FAR.<br />.
B007704HO6|5.0|One of the best books! Amazing story, uplifting and positive! Everyone deserves a second chance - and if you get one, don't waste it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game looks so realistic and is so fun.It's fun trying to win competition's. Sometimes I run out of energy!!!
B003FC6WBQ|5.0|Loved this show all my life! Elegance and style ,charm and grace. It floats me away on dreamy clouds that day dreams are made of.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Best book on Manifesting that I have EVER read: Simple yet concise and an easy read. I l loved it!
B00B9366VO|5.0|Amazing documentary. So many famous artist and records from the past. It was like a trip down memory lane. Highly recommend this one to anyone who loves music.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app gives me what I want when I need it. I like that it will plug in your location as well so you have the weather for your location rather than trying to search for it. Another plus is you can look up weather in other cities, this works great for planning a trip or visit.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great acting and a very intense story line. I have spoken with several friends in the past 3 days and those that have seen the movie had similar comments.
1423140591|5.0|This is a great book and it came in great condition it looks like it is a brand new book
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. Not sure I liked it quite as much as his other two, but still a good read.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Where do we go from here and how do we get there? ? Very interesting! I would recommend to anyone who is conscious.
B000W4RFHK|4.0|Great book for a hike or for a metaphysical hike. I can't get over how cool it is to read about how others experience the outdoors and the fact that these guys use the simplicity of haiku fits so well.
B002QCD2OG|5.0|Really good movie. Last scene is awesome. It is better than the remake done a few years ago. Set on a Scottish island in the modern day but the inhabitants practice ancient paganism.
888370536X|5.0|Quality hard cover moleskin.  The lines are a great size for jotting down little notes, pun intended.  Light and easy to carry, keep it in my purse.
B002KFJWBG|5.0|From start to finish, top to bottom &#34;Odessey (sic) and Oracle&#34; is amazing. Colin Blunstone's voice is one of the marvels of music.
B009GIPDQS|3.0|A good read, kept you interested but The twist at the end was easy to see coming.<br />Not his best work, but a good read all the same
B002RPR6DU|5.0|Embrace the future, people of Moab!  The destruction of the land is at hand.  Lay waste the earth and harvest naught but grief.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Film was very entertaining, special effects were top notch. The only thing I found weak was the story. Overall, was not as good as the first film.
B007UXT6T6|5.0|I love the action and Tom Cruise so the movie did not disappoint. Need more mission impossible movies! Wish I could watch them all at once.
B002R22PB6|5.0|Personally I wouldn't have to see this whole movie to make up my mind what I'd want to do. I would choose death in a heart beat! I believe in life of course because it's a gift from God. But what kind of productive life would you really have if you were seriously disabled such as this poet/man was? You wouldn't have much of a life that's for sure. Other than using your mind you would be a hindrance and complete burden to your family and friends having to take care of you. No thanks! No way! I would be crying everyday for the Lord to hurry and take my life so I could let my loved ones live in peace and not have to worry with me everyday.<br />Well there's my answer to this movie. Sure it's a wonderful movie and I feel all should watch it at least once to learn what life is REALLY all about because this movie will make you think but as for it being a GREAT movie I wouldn't rate it that high. The performance Bardem did of the lead character is just amazing. He's truly one of the best actors on this planet. Love almost all of his movies. This one is truly one of his best. But as for the story itself, it is a little boring but still a wonderful movie. Note: Keep the Kleenex close by! Gave it a 5 star rating because of the fact it's based on a true story and Bardem is in it playing the lead role. Would watch it once but not one I'd want to own and watch over and over again. Too depressing. Hope this review as well as the others on here about the movie will help! :)
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|This is the 1st book I have read by this author.  I found it to be very light and enjoyable reading with a little bit of mystery added to keep my interest. It is not a suspenseful mystery that keeps one on the edge of their seat, but is a relaxing and enjoyable change of pace book.  I especially enjoyed the &#34;hip&#34; grandmas who use technology to do their sleuthing.  I will probably read more of this series of books in small doses.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|It only froze once on me and got blurry for overall less than three minutes. best streaming video experience yet, as I've grown accustomed to more freezing and fuzzy quality.
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|I grew up with THE WIZARD OF OZ and was skeptical about this movie.  I was not sure I would like it. However, I was caught up in the action at the beginning and enjoyed the whole thing.  Even my husband was caught up in the action, and he is harder to please than I am with movies.  It is worth adding to your collection of good movies.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Vcp is so cool. You get drawn into this magnetic principal of wanting your city to advance. I recomend this game for  kids mostly. That's because it is a great game for people who are creative.  Plus even when your not playing the city continues to grow. So you will succeed even if you dont play the game 24/7.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my horse is a great and really fun game! its fun to raise your own horse and be able to clean the stall and paddock. Also you can groom your horse too! I love the fact you can train and compete in completions with your horse! love this app!
B00E9PMMX0|5.0|There's no need to worry if this is worth the money,its a flawless masterpiece full of great acting.effects,fights scenes music and every last thing in the original trilogy! Something for  entertainment every night that NEVER gets old,well worth the money. Surprised its nit higher for this quality of art.
B003VS0CWO|5.0|I have Rocky Horror on VHS and DVD, so when I got a Blu Ray player, needed to add it to my &#34;new&#34; collection.
B00E9PMML2|5.0|Hours of action packed excitement! Great acting,Cgi,story,fight scenes music and everything else in the star wars prequels! No star wars fan should be without this.
B009NY43NY|1.0|If you were like me and couldn't wait to get this final book of the Sookie Stackhouse Series, save your money and imagine your own ending as this book was poorly written and a dull ending.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Such a fun game.  Just can not get enough.  It is a challenging and many level game with many challenges.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My daughter loves this movie and we rent it through amazon for every long trip! Keeps her laughing and occupied.
006178480X|2.0|I must admit that this book, of all of James Rollins books, confused the heck out of me. I cannot get my head wrapped around quantum physics, holograms, and all that scientific stuff about positive energy and negative energy. For a Vet/writer, he is superbly versed in this aspect of science and I am not. I did not like the book, I was confused and had to re-read many chapters and if you had not been a fan of James Rollins and just picked up this book, you would not have known the background on any of the characters. He did just gloss over them.<br /><br />What can I say, but, if you are a fan of scientific mumbo jumbo, you will love this book or else you will be like me and scratch your head and say to yourself, \\"what the heck did I just read about?\\".
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My daughter loves this movie and we rent it through amazon for every long trip! Keeps her laughing and occupied.
1587143879|5.0|4 of my friends (NE) purchased it after reviewing it. Love the task guide in the back of the book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is superb.  I love every episode.  I haven't watched a lot of English shows, but this one is one I'd highly recommend.
B002KYGLVQ|5.0|Scarily relevant in these times! I highly recommend watching this film, if not for any other reason than to see what could be lost if we continue NOT to pay attention to what out government is doing and the rights we are sacrificing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|oh my!  Some really heartbreaking story lines, but they make the show so interesting.  In so many shows, the main characters go on forever.  Not so true with Downton, it makes the story that much more interesting.  Got to say, this season had story lines that made me want to cry, those that made me mad that certain people had to die.  All in all, I can't wait to see what happens next!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Entertaining. I really don't want to say that much more about it, than I really like it, but this thing requires nineteen words or more for a review. Watch it.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I absolutely loooove this game. Its very fun to glamourize your own princess. gave it 4 because there are lots of things u have 2 buy 2 unlock.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It's  a great time killer. I will say if your all about instant gratification I'd say skip one prepared to spend real cash to speed up this game.
B005K17RU0|4.0|The format change took a little time to adjust to, but all in all, a nice change.  Great information coverage.  Map thumbnails of my areas of interest is a good feature.
1455523003|5.0|One reviewer described this book as a 'little cruise missile', and I have to say that I agree totally with that description. Hitchens has given the clear documented evidence to discredit Mother Theresa, the Catholic Church and the nuns in the Missionaries of Charity order. He was appointed by the head of the Catholic church to play devils advocate at the proposed canonisation of Mother Theresa, and this tells us that his opinions were well respected in this area. The book is short, well written and the facts are backed up with documentation, letters and personal anecdotes by people who were working for her or had contact with the charity. The misuse of charity funds is shocking and corrupt but should not really be a big surprise to anyone who has studied the financial dealing of the Vatican. However, more shocking to me is the mistreatment of sick and dying people in the care of these missionary workers which continues in this present time. No medical treatment, no painkillers, no dignity, not even clean needles or nappies for orphaned babies who are kept in filthy conditions till they die, from an organisation which has collected million in donations over the years and now needs to be taken to task regarding the lack of distribution of these millions even for basic human needs for poor dying people.<br /><br />This book is a must read, and especially for anyone who has ever given money to religious charities thinking they were helping the poor. Please think again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so fun to play! caution: very addictive! also let's you challenge your friends online. can be played by all aged. minions are sooo cute!

B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS MOVIE I LOVED ALL ACTORS THEY DID SUCH A GOOD JOB.  I WISH I HAD PURCHASED THE MOVIE SO I COULD WATCH IT AGAIN.
B00CHILW64|5.0|The movie was everything I expected and more. It was thoroughly enjoyable and even more so when considering that it was based on true events.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun! It has simple controls and includes different things to do! Obviously it`s just a simple left, right, up, down game but Subway Surfers includes missions to complete a very wide selection of characters to buy (with coins, no real money involved!) You can also get hover boards, jumping shoes and much more to find! I know you probably think it gets boring but each month a new city is available to update to with a new character for each one! Worth getting, unbelievable that it's free!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|THE MOVIE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHORTER AND WITH MORE ACTION AND LESS QUIET MOMENTS.  SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE PRETTY GOOD THOUGH.
B008I43DYU|5.0|I can't do math half the time and it comes in handy all the time, I always have it by my side when doing my bills.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|WE WERE EXPECTING MORE TECHNICAL ADVANCEMENTS TO UTILIZED YOU KNOW SPECIAL EFFECTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.  SORRY I PAID FOR THIS ONE.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book has honestly been one of the best books I've ever read. The end had me SOBBING!!!! So good! Id give it 100 stars if that was possible!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game may be like temple run and subway surfers but its so much better cause u get to battle vector amd them
B00C6B9XCW|5.0|Movie quality is solid overall. Audio and video are solid (but i'm no expert on the subjects). As for the movie itself, it is done beautifully. The comedy is spot-on and it constantly gives the viewer that comic-book/graphic novel feel. Easily one of my favorite movies of the last 5 years.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have tried to play many different racing apps but this one is the best. It is totally worth it to download this app. This is the BEST APP EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|One of the best and fun games ever I will and would recommend to everyone ever. I would have paid for it.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|It's very fun to  play and meet new people. The only down side is getting the gold coins in order to play.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I played the game at my friends house and I loved it.it was the greatest and it is the best game every.
B003VIWO9I|5.0|Many thanks to Terry Pratchett for an excellent story filled with amazing dimensions of wisdom. Discworld provides the basis for any world you choose to inhabit.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who appreciates a brilliant mind.  Not an easy person to live with.  Kudos to his family!!!
0307913090|5.0|I have viewed the HBO series and read part of the book.  I liked them both, so I bought this audiobook to listen when I travel.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's so much fun that I have my husband hooked on trying to attract more fish than me!  It's colorful and fun!!!
030789701X|5.0|This guide is enormous and provides all the details that a player needs to complete the game in a comprehensive and with alacrity.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|We absolutely love this television show.  My boys enjoy watching it over and over again after their homework is done.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|They say AWOLNATION &#34;transcends genres.&#34;  I'm no music expert, so I don't know what that means.  I do know this: when I turn on AWOLNATION I am transported to a realm of gods, demons and heroes, faced with an endless host of foes, armed only with duty, faith, brotherly love, where I accept a (musical) duel to the death, which no man of honor (or taste) should decline.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Percy Jackson is older, and Riordan knows it. All of the characters from the original series have been aged, and act accordingly. 16 year old Percy is done with the games and is ready for action. This story is intricate, painful, and all the characters are colorful. An absolute must-have for the Percy Jackson fanatic.
B000IKQK7E|5.0|You do not have to over analyze this one.  It is the National Lampoon's classic!  It's just FUN to watch...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app because my children can learn more about God. The can enjoy this wonderful book  while they do their World.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Not a fabulous movie but cute and funny. I am a fan of Bruce Willis, Hellen Mirren, and John Malkovich though. You could put those three in any movie and make me smile.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It's bee a favorite from my childhood and finally get all the episodes on one package it's great offer to me.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow. That's all I can say. I've never read another book like it! I loved it and recomend it to everyone! (If I could give it 10 stars, I would!)
B004UPANAI|4.0|This is a great buy for any fan to add to their collection. I had already watched this movie but my wife is just getting into comic book films and wanted to watch it. The color and quality of the Blu-Ray film is fantastic.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It worked wnderful.  the combination of the usb cable and usb charger are much better for  charging my Kindle than with just the computer cable.  Thank you.  I absolutely love my Kindle!!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game is good.. I don't know if its excites me enough to get a 5 star rating.. But if ur bored it will do :)
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Being a cable/satellite tv service free household - we rely on airwave programming and the internet. Having access to great programming like this via Amazon Prime has saved us from the 'nothing to watch' most nights during this summer. Would love to see more programming like this available within the Prime subscription. Historical series are our favorite - comedies our least.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this.. It has so many creative ideas and sayings.. Everyone should have this app.. I love turning something that most people would throw away into something useful
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson has done it again.  Yet another book I could not put down until the end and found myself enormously disappointed that the next novel in the series is not out yet.  The world he has created in this book is vast, interesting and full of mystery and intrigue.  The characters are compelling, the story lines are well thought out, exciting and even suspenseful at times.  The spren, the &#34;magic&#34;, the ancient artifacts known as shardplate, shardblades, etc. all combine to create an incredible reading experience for any lover of fantasy and even science fiction.  I can't remember the last time my heart was literally racing while reading a chapter of a book, but it happened numerous times leading up to, during and after the climax of this book.  Utterly fantastic and I simply can't wait to read the next volume.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Silo saga - omg so awesome. I stumbled upon these books by total accident. Read the reviews and thought I would give it a try. AWESOME!! MUST READ!!! I am in love with the silo books - have purchased most everyone out there. Have not found one that I do not like. This, being the start of the whole silo craze, is a great starting point (then maybe do Shift, still reading it, I did the Karma series next). I love everything about the world, the people, the writing style, the author. I want more. I would be happy spending the rest of my life reading the silo books! Keep writing them everyone!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Love this song, been playing it daily. Love Daft Punk. Great song a must buy for a fan of the group
B0067RQYNW|5.0|It really helps if you need to create docx. The only thing is you can't upload unless you buy the full trial. I would recommend downloading Documents to Go if you wish to do that.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|It's ok. Hints cost too much. Most are easy, doesn't use the typical emoticon. Not to bad though considering the price.
0345529057|5.0|I am so excited to have all of the books together. They are an amazing read, and I highly recommend them.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|This stabilizer works great...not only as a stabilizer but it also made a great mount for my light...I video a lot of foreclosures and many do not have power so this tool makes it easy!
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Adding this LCD BacPac to my GoPro has made filming easier and more fun. Now that I can review the footage without connecting my GoPro to a computer, I can get a lot more done while I'm out.<br /><br />The only thing I'd say is to be wary that sometimes I have restart the GoPro to make the LCD screen turn on.
B004UID2LC|3.0|it was great for about 2-3 months then wouldn't even search for songs then started slowing down my kindle so I deleted it.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|this film is in world of modern psychiatric practice, with antidepressants used like candy,  fancy tv ads,  sophisticated patients who want relief.  but it is also an old fashioned &#34;whodunit&#34;  with unexpected twists and turns that make it a bit unpredictable and entertaining.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|It was an awesome working app for a long time then it told me I needed more space so delete some songs to get new ones so I did then a few days later I go to listen to music and it deleted all of my songs and wouldn't let me get any more.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|I liked it - it fit my Kindle Fire adequately and kept it from getting dusty and dirty.  I would purchase another one.
B00171RQBW|4.0|&#34;Europa&#34; is the standout song on this album, and I've always heard it in conjunction with Ovid's telling of the story of Europa, another one of Zeus' young female mortal victims. In this case Zeus disguises himself as a white bull, and beguiles Europa, a maiden, into climing up on him, then holding his horns, the bull enters the sea to land on ... Europe. I have no idea if Santana had the myth in mind, but the music seems to follow the story, starting out slow and melodic, changing to a more driving rhythm, and gaining in intensity as it goes.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Very well written and acted. The casting is spot on and, for a legal show, quite fast paced. Definitely worth watching.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. And have not had any issues with app at all could play for hours and hours. Once you start you can't stop.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Television shows about lawyers have never held my attention for long. This show is different. The actors do a nice job of slowly fleshing out their characters and the script and themes interesting.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This is a good quality CD and the time arrival was earlier than I expected, Thank you very much for excellent response.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Excellent for my gamming PC. if you are making a pc for gamming then this is what you want. Price to performance this processor cant be beat.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|so good, wish season three was on prime! You get hooked by this series and just want more, and more!
B00340I4KG|5.0|Loved this movie. Great acting, lots of suspense, looooooong chase scene. Definitely recommend it. Lots of entertainment value. If you can rent it, do.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is an excellent book, well written and very informative. It does a masterful job both of separating and relating history and religious belief. Dr. Aslan's discussion and conclusions in no way diminishes the Christian faith. Well done.
B000G6R7B8|1.0|Update - One year later   Don't buy this watch!  You will just be throwing away your hard earned money.  After about 9 months my watch started to keep time poorly - one day increasing time the next losing time.  I sent it into the NJ service center under warranty.   They lost the watch and refuse to replace it.  In fact, they claim they never received it.  Think I am the only one that has had this happen to them?  Just check out the reviews of the service enter online.  You will find lots of people who have had the same problem or have had to wait months to get their watch looked at and then have been told it would cost more to repair it than buy a new one.    This really puts a bad taste in my mouth about purchasing any Seiko watches in the future.    BUYER BEWARE!    I ordered this watch because I liked the looks and never had an automatic watch before.  To be able to buy something with this much engineering complexity in it for the money is incredible and worth every rating star.  It is a nice looking watch and I like the looks of the nylon strap it comes with.  The watch is well built and is a good size.  It is very easy to read and all the markers line up perfectly.  The see through back is very cool.  It states a water resistance rating of 30 meters but there seems to be some conflicting information here.  I really like the recessed adjustment stem.  There is no way to manually wind this watch by the stem. (As some claim they are doing)  You can manually wind it only by moving it in your hand or on your wrist.  The things I found a little annoying at first were:  (But not worth taking a rating star off for)  The strap is not very comfortable to me.  My main problem with the strap is the metal pieces dig into my wrist on the bottom of the strap causing irritation.  Call me a wimp but it is noticeable to me.  I'm getting used to it, but it does dig into your skin.  I ordered a leather tan strap which should fix this problem.  I do like the looks of the orginialstrap though and am starting to get used to it now that I have been wearing it for a while.  Setting the time perfectly can be a challenge.  I'm used to the second hand stopping when you pull the stem out on a quartz watch.  This one doesn't.  So how do you stop it?  Good question.  I found that if I pull out the time shaft and kind of hold it and turn it counter clockwise while pulling on it makes it stop and you can actually make it go in reverse if you turn it counter closkwise. I'm starting to get the hang of it now but it wasn't intuitive at first.  The directions could have been a lot more clear on this. It states in the manual to pull the stem out at the 12 O'clock position.  Great - but the second hand keeps moving! It would have been nice to have some better directions here.  My watch, after just three days, is running about 5 seconds slow.  (I'm monitoring from one of the atomic clocks)  Most other people reported that their's runs fast.  Not mine.  I'm hoping it will increase a bit once it runs in for a while.  Even so, 5 seconds a day is pretty darn good for an automatic watch in this price range.  I don't have the patience to be taking the back off and trying to regulate it myself.  I can live with 5 seconds a day.  The luminance at night is fair at best.  It's difficult for me to see it in the night.  Then again, I'm getting old and I'm not planning on wearing it much at night, so no big deal.  Just don't expect it to be like a Navy Seal watch with the radioactive luminance spots.  I put it to rest last night for about 10 hours after I wore it all day and it was still running great when I put it back on again.  I don't know how long this thing would run until it ran out.  Some people claims a couple of days or more.  Overall I am very happy with this watch and would recommend it to anyone wanting a good looking and unique time piece for the money.  Quite frankly, I'm amazed they can make something this sophisticated for the price.  It's quite an engineering marvel! For the price I'm tempted to get another one in another color.  I suspect that each one of these has it's very own character due to manufacturing differences and will operate very uniquely.  For Seiko to sell a watch for this price with this much quality is an amazing feat.  I'm a musician and this watch is just like different acoustic instruments.  You can have 10 different instruments manufactured by the same Company, same model, similar serial numbers, etc. but each one will have it's own personality.  That's what's interesting about this watch to me.  I would imagine everyone of these will be unique in it's own way.  Very Cool!  Thanks Seiko!
B00004RJ71|5.0|I remember watching this movie in the theater when it came out.  Parts of it stayed in my mind, as it was extremely powerful.  I'm a high school teacher, and a few of my students mentioned this movie and how much they love it.  Of course I was able to find it on Amazon.  I watched it again as an adult, and it's mind blowing.  It really has to be one of the best chicano life/gang movies ever made.  The 3 main characters are all so tragically beautiful.  So glad I added this DVD to my collection.
B000WQWPKA|1.0|Had to return as it wouldn't play. Disappointed as I love the movie. However, it does NOT have the deleted scenes that other disks do have
0670827592|5.0|I remember this book from a long time ago and did not realize it was still available.  It is a gift for my granddaughter's birthday and I know she is going to love it as much as I do.
B000IZ4R1U|4.0|This is a good pick if you like fictional movies - keeps you entertained from beginning to end - If you have seen the mummy, and liked it, you will also like this
B008YKGQR4|1.0|It keeps jumping from screen to screen in an unpredictable and annoying way.  Still, I suppose you get what you pay for.
B001NAT07A|4.0|While the acting was just so so, it is however a fictional movie about a woman who is a cat - with this said, it is entertaining to watch!
B006MHWXMS|3.0|This app is good for coordinating less than 100 tasks.  After that it begins to lag between editing, saving, and deleting functions. I wanted something to organize my volunteer responsibilities, family schedule, cleaning tasks, menu items, etc. all in one place. When it got to 300 tasks I was waiting up to 10 seconds before it would let me check off another task. Recurrences did not operate correctly for me unless it was set as a daily task. Moved back to the tasks list on my laptop calendar program. Glad I got this during a free promotion and didn't pay for it.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I love this singer. Refreshing music and an amazing voice! I will buy more of her work in the future!
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|It is so gross and if I sad it is good I'd be lieing don't buy or you better run.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Just couldd not put it down just had to keep going on and on and college g those coins<br />I recommend this game for any body with more than ten brain cells extra to kill
B006JRY2QG|5.0|First couple, of episodes are a bit slow, however after that I can say o was hooked up for good. Would recommend to anyone looking into action tv series.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|The quality of the picture on my iPad was standard I didn't know the movie would show in standard form, but its not a kindle fire.
B0000024YL|4.0|Reminds of the old days when times where not so ruff and you did have to worry about the next guy and if he has a gun or bomb.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|The special effects and sounds are great. Fast pacing game. Get your armor and go. I like it very much. I also got it free with my coins.
1781162646|5.0|another book that was hard to put down but at the same time i did not want it to end. another excellent book
B00DP3IGJ6|2.0|While this movie does make you want to see what will happen next, it fizzles instead of popping at the end. Very disapointed.
B0059XTV7Q|5.0|The Blu-ray arrived in a timely manner and undamaged.  I was unable to see the movie as it did not appear near our home.  Loved the movie and highly recommend it to other.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|I love Jonathan and Charlotte their voices harmonize so beautifully . I love all the song choices. and Jonathan is quite possibly the best tenor ever.  He is remarkable and Charlotte is brilliant as well. I bought six for gifts. I love the use of Italian in the songs, it is beautiful.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best tv shows of all time! This is one show that keeps getting better each season. I give it credit for its historical accuracy and the beauty of all the sets. The story line is wonderful too!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is the best game I have played. the graphics are amazing and the storyline is so intriguing! I would recommend. this game to anyone in need of entertainment and thrills
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Horrible film quality, marginal acting, thin and silly plot, absurd nonsensical and stupidly simplistic utter failure to actually incorporate mathematical concepts.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Diamond Dash is a fast paced, addictive game. You can compete against friends in weekly tournaments. Who doesn't enjoy a little friendly competition? There are opportunities to earn awards and achievements. Fun!!
B0084YCKMU|4.0|I can't really say much more than everyone else already has.<br /><br />Why four stars, then?<br /><br />Well, as brilliant as it is, I am not wholly on board with the programme's depiction of Holmes and Moriarty.  I do quite like the character that Cumberbatch portrays, but it is at odds with how I really wanted Holmes to be portrayed.  Moriarty...  Well...  I absolutely loathed Scott's portrayal of the character and... well, the casting of the role.  I understand that the writers/directors/producers/actors may have wanted to separate themselves from the established characters to make them their own, but it's called Sherlock Holmes, not Bones; Castle; The Mentalist; or Numb3rs.<br /><br />Despite all of that, it is the best crime drama I've ever seen.  Heck it's one of the best television programmes I've ever seen.<br /><br />I'll also say this:  Cumberbatch's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes puts me in mind of a super-intelligent Bernard Black from the British sitcom \\"Black Books\\".  His typical wardrobe is incredibly similar, his attitude, his reclusiveness, his annoyance and impatience with mundane people, and even some of his mannerisms.  Watch Black Books, you'll see.<br /><br />TL;DR: Show good if you smart, mmm, big good.  (Maybe OK if you dumb, but might not like.  'specially if no can read good and have to skip to TL;DRs.)
B000BDJ1OM|1.0|I used to have this on cassette and wanted it on CD and it brought back all my childhood memories!
B00AEFYVUQ|5.0|One of Woody Allen's best with excellent writing and directing. The plot was so creative and acting was right on target. Amazing comedy. My hat and coat off to Woody who is a genius!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I watch a lot of different tv shows, but this seems to be the one, when brought up in conversations, that everybody watches.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|You won't be able to stop at just one video - it is absolutely genius at work! The acting was amazing and the writing was something we long to have today with the bland and boring dramas and mini-series now.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|how do you get or unlock megolondon ? I can't  get him does anyone know how to get him  because I can't .
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I'm in the process of writing a book or two for the Kindle, and needed some guidance. Picked this up, and it's a pretty good guide on how to write and build your book. Little technical, but overall satisfactory. Will have my book done soon, and hope to publish it soon.
0062080237|5.0|This is a story of Shadow, a tall massive guy, who is released from prison and immediately pursued by a mysterious guy, Mr. Wednesday. And from then his troubles begin. Shadow finds himself trapped inside a war between the new and old gods: Nordic, Slavonic Gods fight against the Gods of the new generation--God of Internet, Technologies. Outstanding!<br />A masterpiece on its own, influenced by mythology, the novel rises many questions and answers almost to all of them.<br />From a Gaiman fan.
B002NOAF9W|5.0|beyond all expectations the quality is great as is the sound and I havnt even gotten round to the BB King Turner part
B004EBZX6W|3.0|Good graphs, but don't understand channels and the meaning of -db on graph. When my speed is down, graph still is the same. Whats up ?
B008TMA1LY|1.0|They made it so that if you are not paying for new characters then you won't get far. It is outrageous how totally impossible it is to beat a level after the 3rd without extra characters and they all cost so much that you either wait MONTHS to get one free on them or pay cash for it. Honestly it is not that great a game to even be bothered either way, it's really boring and basic play. I deleted it really soon after download. Don't waste your time.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|Wonderful music and the mmovie is done well.  The Phantom character was cast poorly as was Russell Crow in les Mis.<br /><br />Still love both.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Awesome, fun, imaginative. Tom may be crazy but he is good.<br /><br />Recommended to many friends and they all loved it
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|We enjoyed this movie.  The acting was amazing and we appreciated that the filming effects were more &#34;true to period.&#34;  Unfortunately, we were lost a good share of the movie.  We did not have sufficient background in the history to really appreciate what was going on.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|Plays smoothly and frustration free in its simplicity. It's not as sophisticated as some of the other apps out there.  But if you want a quick straightforward game this one is for you. Thank you Amazon for a good faith.
B001E7EONC|4.0|Good video and audio quality. Rented on instant video and downloaded to iPad to watch on a flight. Playback was flawless.
B004APVI1G|5.0|As far as 3D and family friendly, this is one of my top picks overall. It's based on a children's story, but as an avid 3D fan, I have many Pixar, WarnerBrothers, and other children's \\"animated\\" movies. This particular one is one of the most stunning graphically- Feathers have motion realism that I hate to say not even my beloved Rio can compete with, and the story is intriguing as well. This was my first 3D purchase in 2010 and it still tops my list as more movies have been released in the 3D format. If you're a 3D system owner, this is a must have for your collection.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Used to an HP calculator with RPN. This recreated that perfectly. No hang ups or issues at all. Go for it.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Could have been better. Glad I didn't see it in the theater. Watched it twice and still left with hmmmm
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Powerful.  Worth sticking through a hard beginning.  Not for the feint of heart but a must read.  Eye opening.  Beautiful.
B00632HWOG|5.0|No other app works like this one. Dropped it on my Android desktop. Only one I use for yahoo mail.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I really like it and it was worth the money but hey I think it should be free.<br />this game has a sequel I think.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|A comprehensive look at the challenge of educating those raised in extreme poverty. Complex concepts are made understandable for the lay person.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|After ordering a Chromecast on launch day I knew before I even plugged it in. At its price point nothing can even come close to touching what this device can do. After an easy setup, I was launching Nextflix and YouTube videos on my TV in no time. Even the chrome to tv feature I find myself using to share pictures and websites with those in my family. My only complaint is that the unit cannot be used from a computer attached to the network via a LAN cable. There is no reason that this cannot be implemented. I'm excited to see where developers will take the API for this awesome device.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I liked the movie very well.  It had some very good special effects and action scenes.  I hope they do a sequel.
B00000IL29|5.0|Maiden Voyage will always be the album that launched Herbie Hancock's career.  Find a nice comfortable place, grab a cool beverage, and relax to the sounds of a jazz masterpiece.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|I thought the movie was good for an action movie.  Very good special effects and action scenes.  I recommend this movie.
B00594XOZU|4.0|Overall this is my all time favorite app but everyone else has gotten a kik update but my kindle fire hang had one yet????? Any clue when it will be avaliable????
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Riveting, intriguing, gripping, could not stop watching with my wife. Must be cruel watching this offline and have to wait one week for each episode
0345529057|5.0|I'm hooked. This series is amazing. I'm only bummed that the boxed set didn't include \\"A Dance with Dragons\\". The price and quality of the set is wonderful.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Great film capturing the essence of what it was like to truly record, well before digital came around. Great feel.
B008MWBY6W|1.0|Minutes after I received the camera case, I hooked on the carry strap, loaded my camera and a spare battery, and headed for the door to take some pictures. As soon as I took my hands off the case--leaving it to hang from the strap--the strap let go, dumping my new Nikon d5200 on the tile floor. The culprit was the swivel clip that attaches the strap to the bag. It is made of plastic, and one clip just broke under the weight of the camera. In the future I intend to look for steel clips or nylon straps to protect my camera. It appears that the Case Logic SLRC-201 SLR Zoom Holster also uses a plastic clip to hold up the camera bag.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Cut several bottles right away, works well.  This is a light weight tool but does a good job - the technique for getting the bottle to break after it has been scored is the tricky part.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 is as great as the others.  It holds you and just keeps getting better.  The viewer feels attached to the characters giving the season a feeling of being\\"at home.\\"
1742200206|5.0|Just what I need it, a full and amazing New York City guide. I am very happy with this, thanks
B00A44HRG2|3.0|A lot of the camera's didn't work or weren't on so it wasn't as entertaining as I thought it would be.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|This books is definitely a page turner, & one that you won't want to put down-<br />suspense, drama, mystery, love, war, & peace in one book.<br />I've read 2 other books by Kate Mortan & am looking forward to reading more.<br />She's now one of my favorite authors.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I know the book is not written as a tool for anxiety relief but it sure helped mine. I really loved how simple and how positive the book was. I haven't completed all the experiments but I plan on rereading the book a number of times.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|THIS APP IS COOL JUST TRY IT ITS COOL  YOU WILL LIKE IT  CHECK IT OUT  YOU WILL LOVE IT
1932735410|3.0|This book can be confusing to some who expect it to support the PMBOK.  I found the Crowe book was easier to follow and didn't finish reading through the Rita Book.  This book helped a couple of my project managers pass the test,  They used the PMBOK and only used this book.
B002VCR08U|4.0|Fascinating book - worth reading for anyone interested in Frank Lloyd Wright. I knew he was a complex man but hadn't realized how complex
B005DJREGQ|5.0|The title says it all...brings me back to those high school years where things didn't always go the way you expected them to in your young outlook on life. Great characters that are very likable and a neat little show.
B006AN78XS|5.0|This movie will not make any sense to you whatsoever unless you are aware of the historical literary and artistic figures that are prominently featured throughout film. You have to be aware of these historical individuals bodies of work as well as their life stories in order to enjoy the humor that is interwoven between them and the protagonist. I loved it and thought it was the most creative work Woody Allen has ever done (and I have seen all of his movies). Sad only a few individuals will enjoy any of the subtle irony laced throughout the movie such as: &#34;That was Djuna Barnes? No wonder she wanted to lead!&#34;  What a laugh riot!!!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This season did an excellent job of phasing characters in and out with maximum emotional impact, and provided a gradual simmer-to-a-boil chess match between the heroes and a radicalized group of survivors (although parts of the groups' confrontation played out a bit too long or unbelievably, even for a show with a zombie premise).  The characters are transforming believably, for the most part, and we can't wait for Season 4!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and cool<br />Hope it gets more costumes<br />If it gets new updates and more levels I'll go crazy
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Nice graphics, some interesting puzzles.  The game plays a little clunky at times and moving items around with my finger hides what I'm trying to do on the screen.  It is fun and interesting to play.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Good characters and continuing plot line.  You can get hooked easily!  Successful CBS series which my wife and I continue to watch in the current season(s).
B006S086AM|3.0|It seems like the same Zuckerberg character, just couldn't get past it. Another coming of age movie...staring the founder of Facebook.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great characters and a fun show to follow.  You need to see Season 1 to understand fully what is going on in Season 2.
B0096NCVAE|3.0|Its okay... I probably wouldnt pay the price again but legos are expensive. Good thing about them are no matter what legos you buy like star wars or harry potter can all be mixed and still played with.
B004U7JYXS|4.0|At first I was surprised when I opened the box because I saw 2 boxes, and one package. I was like &#34;why did they send me only 3 packs of 10?!? i ordered 50 films/5 packs!&#34; But the boxes are actually 20 in each (2 packs) and the lone pack was another 10. Oops!<br />It came very fast and in good condition, but I was a little wary of the lone pack of 10 because it wasn't in a box. I haven't tried it yet but I have high hopes it will turn out well! :)<br />This is also a pretty good deal when you compare it to other packs of 100 or individual boxes~
0007466064|5.0|In the middle of reading it now, and the book was in perfect condition when it arrived at my door.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Enjoyed watching this movie. Would recommend it to others. Great action & comedy. Almost as good as the first expendables!!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This is really good book, ca nott wait for the sequel Probably the best self published book that I have read.
B006M4F67A|5.0|A no pressure game.played at my own pace. Fun,relaxing,really a new favorite: I'm HOOKED!<br /><br />I plan to return often to play
B0040HO01Y|5.0|So nice to see something &#34;clean&#34; and enjoyable! Wish there was more like programs/series like this. Nice to be able to watch it with out having to worry about the kids being in the room.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I remember watching Star Trek as a kid. Watching the series again as an adult did not disappoint. It's the way science fiction was suppose to be. It is thought provoking, adventurous, and we'll acted. Today's science fiction is mostly gratuitous violence. Star Trek the complete series is a great buy!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I really like the app, especially the tap vs drag element.  It is a drag waiting for the ads every time.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I can be picky, especially when it comes to how a stylus performs.  I bought this stylus for having 3 tips of different sizes built-in.  The stylus exceeds the expectations and hopes I had for it.<br /><br />It works well on all my touchscreens: old non-smartphone, new smartphone, Kindle Fire 7-inch, Kindle Touch ereader, Nook Tablet, Nook Simple Touch ereader.<br /><br />When I have problems with my hands, I will still need to use my Chalkee stylus which I reviewed in the past.[[ASIN:B009LPWASU GreatShield Chalkee Kid Friendly Stylus for Touchscreen Devices (Pink)]]  The title of that review is \\"For Adults Too; Helps with Hand Problems\\" from February 2013.<br /><br />My Chalkee is still going strong after daily use since I bought it in December 2012(no wear, functions as excellently as it did from the first).<br /><br />The Chalkee is too big to fit into the carrying case for the smartphone I just bought.  So that's why I was in the market for a second stylus.<br /><br />I will be using this 3-tip stylus on any day that my hands allow me to.<br /><br />Can you tell that I adore this 3-tip stylus and my Chalkee too?  :D
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I liked reading this book.  The author seemed to do his research very well.  I saw the movie, which was excellent as well, and the book was excellent as well.<br /><br />Art Gager
B00003CXA6|4.0|Be sure to set aside a LOOOOOG evening for this film...over 3 long.  Watched it before going to Gettysburg and it really made everything come to life for our trip
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great for kids. My 10 year old daughter loves it. Adults will like it as well. It's real cute and fun.
B005DKLPQ0|5.0|This review is for the uninitiated...Longtime fans need no sales pitch...<br /><br />The Smiths are not for everyone, but they were one of a kind. When their debut caught my ear in 1984 I had never heard anything like it. Refreshingly new and different; yet anachronistic of an earlier era at the same time. Johnny Marr's guitar was haunting and hypnotic. As for the singer, love or hate Morrissey, he had a style all his own. Wholly unto himself, with no point of reference to be found anywhere in the annals of Rock & Roll. But the band was more than than just Morrissey & Marr. As a rhythm section Mike Joyce and Andy Rourke were as formidable and unique as they were essential.<br /><br />Lyrically, there was something potent at work. Mysterious and ambiguous, literate and puerile. Chock full of mordant self-deprecating wit, gallows humor and above all else, humanity. I never understood the gloom merchant moniker attached to them because they were so damn funny. More Earling Studios cut with Joe Orton black comedy than brooding Goth.<br /><br />So if you were as taken by their debut as I was, you're going to want it all. And outside of a few stray singles, here it is.<br /><br />The Smiths (1984) begins with  \\"Reel Around The Fountain\\"  and its refrain \\"it's time the tale were told of how you took a child and you made him old\\".  \\"This Charming Man\\", \\"Pretty Girls Make Graves\\" are among the classics including the chilling & controversial \\"Suffer Little Children\\" about the 1965 Manchester Moor child murders committed by Ian Brady & Myra Hindley.<br /><br />Hatful of Hollow (1984) followed months after and marks the debut of the now classic \\"How Soon Is Now\\". Despite being a compilation of  BBC 1 recordings, singles, B-sides it sounds like a cohesive album. While there is some track repetition essentials abound from the hilarious \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\" to jaw dropping spare ballads like \\"Back To The Old House\\" and \\"Please Please Please Let me Get What I Want\\".<br /><br />With Meat Is Murder (1985) the band took an astounding leap forward and are at the top of their game. \\"How Soon Is Now\\" becomes a hit at home & abroad. Classics abound from start to finish including \\"Rusholme Ruffians\\", \\"I Want The One I Can't Have\\", \\"That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\\", \\"No Where Fast\\" and \\"Well I Wonder\\". Full confession, its my favorite Smiths album.<br /><br />For many a critic and fan The Queen Is Dead (1986) is the epitome. I'm not going to argue though I find it slight in places. The gut wrenching \\"I Know Its Over\\" is the ultimate break up song of a relationship that never happened. \\"Never Had No One Ever\\" sends a chill while there's plenty of tongue in cheek in \\"Vicar In A Tutu\\"  and \\"Frankly Mr. Shankley\\". Marr & the band shine on \\"Big Mouth Strikes Again\\" while \\"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out\\" is one of the moving yet devastatingly funny things they ever cut. In other words, pure Smiths.<br /><br />Strangeways, Here We Come (1987) marks their last studio album. Named after a local Manchester mental hospital, the contents are more solid than the title suggests. While their last, one can't escape the sense its overlooked and an anti-climatic demise of one of the 80's greatest bands. Marr and company continue to explore new ground musically. Lyrically, Morrissey forges a shaky alliance between confidence and insecurity. \\"Girlfriend In A Coma\\" is the most popular track but \\"Death Of A Disco Dancer\\" is a major standout along with \\"Unhappy Birthday\\".  \\"Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me\\" is the Morrissey ballad to end all Morrissey ballads.<br /><br />Both World Won't Listen and Louder Than Bombs (1987) are maddening attempts to pick up the pieces. Both contain an overlap of essential singles & B-sides & repeats from Hatful of Hallow. It all smacks of a label trying to recoup its loss. And while Morrissey could be accused of indulgence, the same can't be said for the rest of the band. But there is some incredible stuff here, most notably, \\"Stretch Out & Wait\\" and \\"Unlovable\\". \\"Shoplifters Of The World Unite\\", \\"London\\" and \\"Half A Person\\" are 3 of the best things they ever cut after \\"Queen\\". The quietly stunning \\"Asleep\\" serves as a powerful good bye for a band that never got a chance to write it's own epitaph.<br /><br />Last but least is the live album Rank (1988) and I think the title alone sums up the band's attitude toward it.<br /><br />So here's a seasoned vets overview...For better and worse, The Smiths are worth the ride...t notably, \\"Stretch Out & Wait\\" and \\"Unlovable\\". \\"Shoplifters Of The World Unite\\", \\"London\\" and \\"Half A Person\\" are 3 of the best things they ever cut after \\"Queen\\".

B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Jack the giant slayer is an awesome movie. Its appropriate for kids but it is also well made and is entertaining for adults! I watch this movie all the time!
B0091WAWTM|1.0|I should have stopped the movie halfway through, but, I thought there might be a good ending.  I don't know what others saw in this movie.  I thought it was simply STUPID!  I'll never get that time back.  :(
B006PFC2S2|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies growing up! I used to sing all the songs, it drove my sister crazy! Appropriate for kids and entertaining for adults.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait for season four. This is a very compelling series and it was great that I could watch one episode after the other. If you have not seen it you must!
B000001DQI|5.0|GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD STILL IS ELTON AND HIS BANDS  GREATEAST  ACHIEVEMENT.  THIS WAS ELTONS GREATEST BAND  WITH DAVEY,,NIGEL,, AND DEE. MOST OF THESE SONGS WERE CUT IN JUST AFEW TAKES  SOME IN ONLY ONE TAKE... SPECIAL THANKS MUST GO TO ELTONS BACK OF THE HOUSE TEAM WITH GUS, AND DEL. THESE TWO WERE GREAT ARRANGERS AND GREAT PRODUCERS. THIS DOUBLE ALBUM IS ELTONS CROWN JEWEL OF HIS RECORDING CAREER. THE NEWLY MASTERED CD SOUNDS GOOD BUT THE DVD ON THE MAKING OF THIS 5 STAR MASTERPIECE IS A JOY TO WATCH.THIS WAS ELTON JOHN AT HIS FINEST BUT  ,,,, HIS MUSICAL HELPERS TOOK IT ALL THE WAY TO EMERALD CITY...
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Picked this up as the FAOTD a while back. I don't buy a whole lot of apps but this one I think would be worth the $2. There are other, similar game out there, but this one stands  out with its updated graphics, smooth gameplay, and the quest to beat your high score.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Each time I sat down to read parts of the book before I went to sleep I knew that there would be some interesting example of how to look at life.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|I wanted the inception affect, where I questioned my sense of reality.  It was pretty plain what was happening. :-/
0064471837|5.0|My grandmother handed me this book which was listed as young adult. I am so glad that she handed it to me, or I might have missed out on a gem of a series.  Once I began reading it, I could not put it down.  I can say that it is an incredible story, set in a world, lushly described and with a passion that swept me into it.  I emediately had to read the rest of Nix's books and made certain to obtain all of the Abhorsen series.  I would heartily recomend the books to anyone, young adult or adult.  It has the distinction of being one of the few series I have placed on my desk where I can grab it at any time! Definately a MUST read!
B008US4PBY|5.0|By far the best solution out there, works very well and being able to fully and completely custom map the layout is worth the price of admission itself. No complaints at all. Slick little unit, and it wasn't clear but the reason the price is $10 higher than on the cronus website is that it includes the bluetooth dongle needed to use a PS3 controller on an Xbox, or PC. Or in my case to use my wireless keyboard and mouse on my older bluetooth PC since I was only trying to use an Xbox controller.
B004JM8X5E|5.0|For whole family!!! Makes you think!! You will need tissues - but a wonderful movie. Different from others. Go get it!!!!
B001O1O71C|5.0|You really get sucked into this story, as if you are really there with Bruno and Shmuel. I wasn't ready for the story to be over, but alas, we all know how it ends. Worth all 5 stars.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I finally broke down a purchased a case for my long trips (10-15 hr plane flights overseas).  The case is very light weight and slim - perfect for my backpack when I don't want a heavy bag for long trips.  My only complaint is the groove could be a little deeper to hold the flap more firmly when propping up the Kindle.  The Kindle doesn't fall but if you bump it....or the passenger in front of you on the plane aggressively reclines and bumps your fold-down tray.....the flap pops out about 3 out of 5 times.  It doesn't happen all of the time but enough to be slightly annoying.  Don't let that stop you from purchasing this.  It's a great price and very, very light weight and will protect the Kindle on long trips and allow you to read/watch video without holding it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've been looking for an app like this for both my Kindle and my iPhone, and I've definitely found the right one! It's customisable, runs smoothly, and works great for me overall!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.  It's very challenging. Super fun. It's a good game for children. No fighting or shooting just trying to outrun the guard and his little dog.
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|I like this point and click game. The problem I have with this game is all the back and forth. The map helps but it would be great if you could go to the map, select a destination and go there directly. I also can't get the yellow gem down. I know you have to shake your device and I've done that but it will not come down.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|I really enjoy a quick moving game after a day of work. it doesn't require too much thought so it wont tire you out mentally, just tire out your fingers as with any game worth playing
B002BVOYBW|5.0|Awesome movie! I can't believe I had never seen it before. The cast is not only good but you'll see faces you never expected.
B00ABLJ5NQ|4.0|It's unusual for me to read anything in this fantasy/supernatural genre, but I was won over by the really high standard of the prose. Some of it is quite beautifully written. I also enjoy reading about intelligent children, so that was a bonus.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I love zombies.  As a Walking Dead fan, I thought this would be a great zombie read.  I was disappointed in the way the story was told. Interviews with people around the world, instead of the story of a group of characters you could bond with and get to know.  Way to many short interviews to ever bond with a single character.  I have not seen the movie, and after reading the book, I doubt I will.  I finished the book, but unlike other books I have read, I was glad when I finished the last page.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Yet again, Khaled Hosseini weaves a complex, multi-generational and intriguing saga. Fascinating characters and a few plot twists add to the enjoyment of this novel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I find it genius that they made a app with over 100 games on it. its a great way to pass the time its awesome
B007KOMTUI|5.0|The best entertainment ever! Jon Hamm is so easy on the eyes, and the story line is Soap Opera type. Lot's of great interesting relationships, funny, drama and all around juicy Jackie Collins Style.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|I'm torn between not liking and it was ok.  For whatever reason, I just don't believe the world of GI Joe that is set before me in last two releases.  That's not how I remember the IP.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|I just purchased the insanely popular Teen Beach Movie right onto my daughters Kindle Fire and it took only 30 seconds to download and now we own movie! So easy to do, now we have her favorite movie on the go! GREAT TEEN/KIDS movie. The singing & dancing is so entertaining, I even enjoy watching with my daughter. GREAT MOVIE & EASY DOWNLOAD!
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|They tried to appease the teenie bopper culture.<br /><br />In some parts it got kitche, and probably would have been better on the Sci Fi channel than the big screen.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|It isn't bad it suck so much I wanted to deleted it so stupid terrible it's good the first time you play it then it sucks so bad
B008X9Z37A|4.0|Belkin makes great products. It covers my kindle fire hd and I open and fold it like cracking the spine of a slim book of poetry, very satisfying. The corner stops seem a little loose and may stretch out, but it was inexpensive and hopefully will stay that way.
0316228583|4.0|I downloaded the book without reading the description or any customer reviews. I bought it solely because of the author. I am an adult and a huge Harry Potter fan. I was not expecting this to be anything like Harry Potter, but was excited to see what else JKR wrote.<br /><br />I read some of the reviews after I finished the book to see what others thought since I was feeling conflicted about my final opinion. I was surprised by what I found because I had a different take than many that posted. I did not have a problem following that many characters. I did not find the characters unlikeable. I did not find the first half boring. I did not think JKR was writing for shock value.<br /><br />I thought it was a conventional \\"how are all of these people going to be connected\\" type plot with very interesting characters. I liked that there was not a good guy or bad guy. The characters were written like actual people with good and bad traits, beautifully written. I read a little before bed each night and found myself really looking forward to reading more.<br /><br />The last of the book picked up quickly and went in a direction I was not expecting. I hated the ending plain and simple. I put the book down feeling disturbed and disappointed.<br /><br />It appears this book is definitely not for everyone. I will say though that I found myself thinking about the book, the characters, their story lines, that awful ending, all of it days after I finished. It stuck with me and made me think.  It is an odd feeling because I do not think this has ever happened before, but overall I guess I loved it and hated it.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I think this is not the best example of &#34;good story&#34;, too artificial and not very entertaining or educational or other. No recommendation of this book from me... the &#34;killer was the butler&#34;  kind of story.... :-)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|REALLY FUN AND ADDICTIVE! :-)<br />Good time, a game my kids can play. I like how it switches countries. RECOMMENDED TO ME BY A FRIEND.
B00BUNQOOM|5.0|Good song writing. Tough, muscular guitar work. The passage of time has done nothing to harm the first rate work of this long neglected band.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|my family loves how large the buttons are. how easy we can use it, plus it has great memory. we also like how it keeps track of your input so you can check for errors.
B00DUIBZSK|4.0|I love Selena Gomez, this time she did a great job! There's always room for improvement though. Looking forward to more!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book was great.  My husband never understood why he had to look at me when I talked to him, in fact he made fun of me for 45 years until he read this book.  now he knows the answer.  Likewise, I never understood why he was always &#34;looking for  compliments.&#34; all the time, or so I thought that is what he was doing.  now, I feel differently.  we spend 30 minutes a day of quality, face-to-face time, talking. and I make sure to let him know how much I appreciate all his efforts and how good he looks.<br />45 years would have gone more smoothly if we both realized the other's LOVE LANGUAGE.
B004NYQYNQ|4.0|I really do like her voice and her music. I would like to hear some thing more positive along the same sound
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This game is super fun I personally love it. Uno is great for my little brother hope you have fun!;)
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|As usual JBJ has made another great album which  i have enjoyed.  Looking forward to seeing him perform in concert
B00CWY76CC|3.0|There wasn't a lot of levels but it was fun and really made u think hard and to think ahead.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This film came highly recommended and I can see why. It has an interesting twist in the plot as it follows a quartet through their history together. Each personality is highlighted as the film progresses.
B0045HCJFS|5.0|all of the movies I have ordered have been great except for Remember Me, I really enjoy all of them, Thank you!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was better.  There's a lot going on in Kat's head that doesn't get conveyed in the movie.  It's definitely a good read, and easy to get into on the go, like waiting in line at the grocery store...
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Not sure if I like the game....sometimes ifs so easy, and then at times I get stuck for dAys on one clue...it's okay..
B000PDYVVG|5.0|If you are a woman searching her soul for reason and method to the madness, this is the book for you. It's not about finding God, or any particular religions, it's about finding happiness in yourself.  And that really IS kinda important.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Really interesting plot and visually stimulating. Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman are great in this movie. We highly recommend watching!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book is such a wonderful telling of falling in love. The young love displayed by fantastic characters gives the reader hope.
B000HL2J0G|1.0|Only turned it on because I was bored. I would not normally rent this. I do recommend this to anyone.
B00CU8OVIM|4.0|I likes J. Cole but I was not like a fan. After hearing Born Sinner I am now a fan. Hes really cool with his lyrics. Will support him from now on.
B00821OX98|5.0|Spent the whole weekend watching this series. Can't wait to watch the next season! I fascinated me and I want to watch more!
B0013D8LOK|5.0|If you like the stage play you will love this movie. The acting and characterization are superb and the music is remarkable!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Mathew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon and the supporting cast of young boys in this film are fantastic. Great story with underlying themes.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is probably Frank Capra's best film. A wonderful tale of what life would be like if you were never born and the results of your absence in the lives of the ones you love. I love this movie! A Christmas must see!
B00181MHQU|5.0|I watched this with my 9 year old granddaughter.  We both loved it.  She loved the dresses the women wore at the dance, the songs, and, especially the story.  I enjoyed the movie just as much or more than when it came out.  I appreciated the choreography much more.  Quite impressive.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|The game doesn't seem to have any point.  You just click the same two spots on the screen over and over again. I wouldn't even call it a game...don't waste your time downloading it.
B004GUS7VE|5.0|I have read Vanity Fair three times over my 62 years, and I've enjoyed it more each time.  It's a wonderful story, with characters you come to really care about ... and I love it that, when you read a book from nearly 200 years ago, the people are just the same as people today.  On my last reading of the book, in 2013, what impressed me most is that it's just very funny.  William Thackery was a funny man.  If you enjoy novels, read this one!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved Downtown Abbey. I love BBC shows. This one does not disappoint. Can not wait for Season Four! Will watch for sure!
B00BDAP66E|4.0|This is a great way to keep track of all your pages at once, it's also a neat tool that they send you updates and notifications daily.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Best game ever!!!!!!!!! It is so addictive and the graphics are sweet!!! I have not been able to put the game down!!!
0064471837|5.0|I first read the series as an adult recovering from jaw surgery. I had borrowed them from the library.  I couldn't tell if the magic affected me the way it did because they were that good or because of the drugs.  After I recovered I bought the set.  It was the books.  I have since re-read them several times and listened to the tapes once.  Both of my children have read them numerous times and \\"Sabriel\\" (the book) is starting to fall apart.  Just writing this makes me want to read them again.  It's time.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|this game is fun to play multiplayer by yourself is that a lot of the remotesand I would recommend it to my friends
B00632HWOG|5.0|I actually like the app beter on my kindle fird hd vs. my phone. I like how the whole email mail show up amd I don't have to follow a link to see the actual email.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|As a newly converted Hitchcock fan, I found the movie riveting but also troubling. I thought most of the actors pulled off their individual parts rather well with the exception of Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh. I absolutely loved Janet in Psycho, so I had high hopes but she didn't transform. I thought Brian Darcy who played Anthony Perkins was splendidly cast. The trouble with this movie was that I was unsure of what was true. Most of the film felt like movie magic. Just having completed a course on the man himself I found the story line of Alma confusing and unreal but then again how much do we really know about them. Overall I thought the movie was enjoyable but don't take it as the final word on Hitch and Alma's relationship.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging but easy enough for you to finish! Great game if you love escape games and have some extra time on your hands
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Buy this album and buy his other album &#34;Coming From Reality&#34;. Watch the movie &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34; that's how I got hooked.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Too many technical (medical) terms...Too clinical....Not a book for the everyday person! Not easy to re like &#34;Heaven is For Real&#34;.
B001ZG4J00|5.0|Buy this album and buy his other album cold fact. Watch the movie &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34; that's how I got hooked.
B003U53GK8|2.0|From one convoluted plot twist to the next, this show never redeemed itself. They should've killed John Locke a couplr seasons earlier and called it quits.....
B00CJGP116|5.0|In this new CD Marc Anthony trully Rocks , his amazing voice and passion for his music is felt throught the whole album . It was worth the wait . Looking forward for his english album, which he is currently working on and the concert 9/1/13 in New York . In one word he is \\"AMAZING\\".
0064471837|5.0|This story is a great tale of the heroine coming into her own. It had the perfect villain and great sarcasm from the peanut gallery companion/familiar. I love the trilogy, but the first story was really what got me hooked onto the world of necromancers, future seerers, and ancient wall builders.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Couldn't be simpler to get up and going with the Chromecast. Takes less than 2 minutes to setup.<br /><br />Works flawlessly.<br /><br />Only word of caution is that you need a strong wifi connection and a pretty decent spec computer to do the tab casting reliably.<br /><br />Awesome value for money.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved this series.  It's been a long time since a book has peaked enough interest that I couldn't stop reading.  No classic plots of violence or sex to drag in a ready just a great story that will have you turning page after page!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I love this show can't wait for more episodes never can get enough of Jax and Juice!  Jemma is one mean ol lady.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game. I like the different levels. I hope that they add more. My whole family loves to play this game.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|I'm continually amazed by how clear the Disney and Pixar films are on Blu ray discs. You'd swear you're looking at a moving lithograph. The menu screens are fun too.
1439148953|5.0|the book arrived in good condition and well ahead of promised date.  the story is easy to read and free of sensationalism and feel that it deiicts the era and situation quite well.
0743243153|5.0|Everyone should read this book. Very well written and a timeless message about love for all of us. I will be reading it over and over.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|this album is great it has power of the the first four with the freshnes of the black album and st. anger they got an ace card here
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What a wonderful story!  I have greatly appreciated the duplicated setting of WWI, the &#34;Great War&#34;.  It was a horrible war, as they all are, but the suffering and trama is captured  dramatically and painfully by the setting and photographer.  Hard to watch, but a time we must be famaliar with.  Bravo to the entire cast!
B002C6K7N0|5.0|this album should be the blueprint for all metal albums one of my most favorite albums of all time this has grove heart and you can bang your head to it
156224003X|4.0|Maestro Werner has shed a bright light on an area of art-making (and creativity in general) that has remained in the dark for far too long.  I often read self-help books with a pencil in hand, ready to underline any particularly interesting notion or potentially helpful advice--  I found myself underling nearly EVERYTHING in Effortless Mastery.  The book contains far too many deep insights to provide even a semi-intelligble outline of them here, but one of the most salient ones for me involves the very common, creativity-killing feeling/belief among many artists that \\"the greats\\" possess some magical essence unattainable by us \\"mere mortals;\\" Kenny assures us that this is not at ALL the case and lays out a methodical program for attaining the mastery we so admire in our heroes.  He is, however, careful to explain that there are no shortcuts to achieving mastery and that, as much of a game-changer as his insights are, internalizing them and being transformed by them will require a great deal of dedication, time, and patience.  What he does NOT endeavor to explain is how many legendary artists (especially in the world of jazz) managed to achieve mastery (which Kenny insists is only possible by divesting oneself of ego and deliberately and consistently entering a zen-like state of detachment) without employing ANY kind of similar methodology (much less the kind of quasi-spiritual one we find in Effortless Mastery); one is left to ponder such mysteries on one's own (How DID/DO so many ego-driven, anti-spiritual, non-meditating, and/or seriously drug-addicted jazz musicians attain(ed) such a high level of mastery??  We find no answers in Effortless Mastery.).  This may prove to be a flaw or drawback for some.  Another possible flaw or drawback (one with which I find myself grappling) is that Maestro Werner insists that each step of his Four Steps method MUST be mastered before moving on to the next one while, as far as I can tell, providing no great clue as to how one can be certain this mastery has been achieved (He DOES explain that mastering each step takes \\"as long as it takes\\" and that one should avoid placing any pressure--  including the pressure of a deadline--  on oneself while mastering each step.  But, as far as providing \\"signposts of mastery\\" indicating that one is ready to tackle the next step goes, there don't seem to be any, particularly with regard to Step One.  As far as I can tell, one could spend the rest of one's LIFE on just Step One, doing nothing more than first \\"centering\\" oneself in \\"The Space,\\" then slowly and robotically articulating a series of individual notes... lather, rinse, repeat!).  All in all, however, Effortless Mastery is an entertaining and illuminating read which should occupy a space on every artist's bookshelf.
B00BEXB18M|2.0|i loved every thing from the system has failed intil now it was to teenage dude your METAL kings way change the formula your one big chance to beat metallica bad from lulu thow this is no where as bad you guys fn rock
B00992CF6W|5.0|I  absolutely luv minecraft. Tho I can't use the craft table or get a wolf in this addition, I still like to play it and can't wait for the next update!!<br />And I like the thought of realms where u can play with a multiplayer mode and of anyone in that WiFi server is playing you can play and team up with them. I luv this game totally worth it
B00785P2QC|5.0|ADDICITING OF A GAME! SPEND EVERY HOUR ON IT! YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD NOW. YOU ARE MISSING OUT ON SOME FUN!
B000JML90Y|3.0|As a strictly science book it left a lot to be desired.  As a possible explanation for a materialistic and worldly view of the world we live in, yeah I'll buy it.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|It is a really fun game, and it is free!!!  Can't wait for more levels to come.  Really get addicted easily.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|They are collecting dust as of this moment I know I should try and resell em but they are good for just in case I move and the tenants there hate my 5.1 speakers and I have to resort to these.<br /><br />Sound Quality:8<br /> The quality of these are great at low volumes but I like to be immersed in the sound and at high intervals the sound clips and the louder you make these the more they will distort and the more you turn up the bass on these the more it will distort : /. The sound extender is nice but makes some of the smaller less audible sounds you hear faintly seemed to get lost in the effect, not a big thing but I payed a good price for these would like the same kind of quality my audio techinas provide.<br /><br />The soundstage is great though you really feel an expansive ear to ear stage and the sound card you use applies to this as well I love when I turn the camera and I hear the voice growing faint in the right ear then I turn it towards the NPC and I hear it raising it's volume so it does whats it's supposed to in PC regards. On the 360 COD has the same pains in volume distortion but it does let you hear footsteps and sounds actually better on game consoles in regard to what I hear on the PC.<br /><br />Comfort: 8.5<br />They are not heavy but the earcups are kinda small and after like an hour and a half use the ears become kind of bothersome slight uncomfort. but other than that it fits great and the cushions are nice and soft. the volume controller is slightly big and sometimes is not long enough to clip comfortably also the cords are annoying when you got to switch them from pc use to xbox use but that's generally not to much of an hassle.<br /><br />Durability: 8<br />Can't really judge this to efficiently since I don't use them all the time or not really to much at all but from the use I have done it's held together but they do seem fragile so be careful. I've heard of heavy users all having durability problems with these.<br /><br />Verdict<br />I bought these because they were multi platform and they were worn by this you tube guy that I watched and he said they were ok and a week after I got them the game audio died out in both ears for him : / but since turtle beach has good customer service you do have the ability to contact them and get a new pair you just got to pay for shipping. I did not use the mic really so I didn't rate it but I did test it out and the mic performs really well with no outside noise breaking through I didn not have any complaints on COD that my voice was to loud.<br /><br />These are an old model now I'd say I'd kind of recommend them for medium users but maybe sharkoon sp might fit better even though I heard their mic fails alotta the time. Up to you the gaming headsets all fall apart through heavy use and most of the top brands Tritton, TB, Astro, etc are all very good either with consoles or pc or mics or sound quality so you just have to pick one and register and keep that warrenty! : ).
0441013597|5.0|Hands down one of the absolute best works of science fiction thus far, not a whole lot more to say. As it nears its 50th birthday it continues to age marginally at most, exploring themes and stories we can all relate to, even today, yet also tell a tale of great war and struggle against true evil, among countless other things. I mean no offense to anyone particularly religious, but it is pure fact that like the Bible or any other sacred text, you can read this book countless times and gain something different from it with each read.<br /><br />11/10. BUY IT.
B00594XOZU|4.0|It's awesome! But I also wanna know how to update it because it'll let you do much more. My friend has the update and I'm so jelly... HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
1401937519|5.0|just received this book yesterday.  will let you know when I'm finished with it.  So far have found it very thought provoking
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|With new tricks and graphics, the story told brings life and diversity to the puzzles. The colors, sounds and effects are very engaging. A most fabulous game!
B000K4X5XA|1.0|The case was damaged and it had finger prints on disc.  I was disappointed.  I thought I was going to get good quality.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I play several games like this on my computer and to be able to play it on my mobile devices is fun.<br />I love this game because it makes me use mind to figure out what the best shot would be in order to remove most bubbles.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Enthralling and moving from start to finish. Very emotional and Naomi Watts is understated and perfect in her performance. See it.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|It's really fun and doesn't take an hour to load. It's doesn't Pause the game just to give you an ad for the stupidest games it's really fun, plus it's for adults and children of all ages so you can play the game without having to keep your phone (or other devices) away from your kids unless they want to run off with your phone (or other devices) from how great it is. How you have fun with your new game!!!!
B008PZZV8S|2.0|Too little action - story was too dragged out.  I like Matt Damon but this was a bummer part for him.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I really like bubble games. This one is really great. Keep up the good work. I plan to refer it too many.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Firefly is a clever, intelligent show. The dialogue is sophisticated, and well above the quality of the average series. The characters are well-developed and engaging. Moreover, the show is infused with what used to be considered &#34;good old-fashioned morals.&#34; The stories take the high ground, with honesty, courage, and a drive to do the right thing because it is the right thing. The show is not only entertaining, it is uplifting.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I just started watching Sons of Anarchy. I love this show!! Big fan very addictive. Would recommend this show to everyone. Can't wait to watch all of them.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love the entire series. Great drama without getting graphic with regard to sex and romance, although the last show of season 2 was a bit more than necessary.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I HESTATED BUY THE CAMERA APP, BUT I AM GLAD I DID GET IT...THE PICTURE QUALITY IS NOT GREAT, BUT IT IS NICE TO HAVE IT TO TAKE A PICTURE WHEN I WANT...YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU NEED YOUR CAMERA...
B000VMFDW2|5.0|What else can be said. I'm not big into nonfiction, but this was engaging, and very thought provoking. It explained the horrors of war as one who lived it and kept his integrity would.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|THIS WAS A WONDERFUL GAME, BUT IT ENDED TOO SOON...WHERE IS THE REST OF THE GAME?  WHAT IS GOING ON?  WHEN WILL THERE BE MORE, WILL HAVE TO PAY MORE MONEY TO GET THE REST OF THE GAME????  NOT NICE TO TEASE SOMEONE...
0770437400|5.0|I never imagine reading books about zombies, but this was great. Brooks is very good about how the human condition can be affected by a zombie pandemic.
B004NELBPC|4.0|I like the Progressive outlay of this publication and often go online for its substance.  Reporting is accurate and it give the Conservative as well as Progressive outlooks which is balanced, for me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't usually buy books.  I get them from the library.  The first book in the series was free and it had me hooked so I bought the whole series at once.  I couldn't stop reading it!  A great read and now I can not wait for the the next series to come out in a few days.  I'm glad I just found the series I don't think I could of standed waiting months to read the next book!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Superbly well written and acted as well as a feast for the eyes!<br />Looking fwd to new season when available.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|absolutely love this kindle app.  it has worked great.  downloads are quick and very easy to find and work with.
B0098460O4|5.0|Saw Charlotte and Jonathan on youtube.com and fell in love with their voices.  This cd is simply fantastic! Beautiful songs, extremely well done, hope they record more cd's soon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|We love this game!! It's fun for the whole family. Addicting for adults yet easy enough for kids. My grandchildren and I love it. Thanks and keep up the good work.
B0002F6AH0|3.0|No subtitles throughout, simply the original series remastered in wide-screen format. The dialogue is frequently difficult to understand.<br />The original series had the full co-operation of the Imperial War Museum. Its restatement at the beginning of each disc is tiresome.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved that this book in the trilogy kept me guessing the entire time.  It was just as good as the first!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I found the book to be most engaging, especially the correlation between the two lives. I did however find the ending to<br />be somewhat abrupt.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the most freaking awesome game in the<br />WORLD!!!And ALL MUST KNOW about PocketInvEditor app!You can make<br />MCPE just like MC X-box edition!!!!Also Block Launcher!!!With block launcher you can<br />change your skin,texture pack and you can get MODS!!!You can go to the Nether and<br />the Aether!!!
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|Me gusto muchos los efectos, especialmente  en Blue Ray,  muy buenas escenas, me gusta este tipo de peliculas, saludos  a todos.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I wish I could give more stars! What a new and different approach to romance novels! I fell in love with Drew... even though he can be a butt-head at times--and loved watching Kate give him what he deserved. Wow! I'd heard several authors I follow recommend this book, so I grabbed it for something fun to read. After I finished the book, I ran to the author's web site and read the extra stories she has on there. And then back to Amazon to immediately pre-order the next books in the series. It's. That. Good. Can't wait til the next books are released. This is definitely an author to watch! I know I'll read this book again. And since my TBR mountain is so scary high, that's saying a lot.
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|I'm pretty sure Tom Cruise or (especially) Morgan Freeman (or their agents) were in their own \\"oblivion\\" when they signed on to this project - it had to be the money as they certainly could not have been attracted to the quality of writing or directing...  but... bills have to be paid and, given IMDB's report of $120M cost, this little gem certainly helped many of folks on that account.  Slow, weird, and predictable... I had the clone angle figured out pretty early in the film. Similar idea explored, with greater artistry and must less budget, in Duncan Jone's \\"Moon\\" (with Sam Rockwell) -  save your money, it's not worth the price.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|I wish I could get my kids to read it, but they are more interested in living for today.  Great insights into the accumulation of wealth.  I could easily put everyone I know (including myself & my husband)into the categories.  Great insights into why  people save or spend.  I highlighted many sections of the book and read them to my husband (not a reader). I never read him parts of books! I don't think you will enjoy THE MILLIONAIRE NEXT DOOR if you are purchasing happiness and status.  But it MIGHT change the way you look at your boring, hardworking relatives and neighbors.
B0098QBEXO|4.0|Well acted, sad, funny,  inspiring film with many bright moments.Cumberbatch is, as usual, authentic and believable. Well written. My only criticism is that various British accents (and my faulty American ear) caused me to miss some of the dialog.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I loved this book so great that I loved it at the first word of the book so great that you should try it
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is a great game. The first couple of games were free. But you have to pay for games after the free ones. But the prices are reasonable.
B00CTKHXFO|4.0|The only thing it is missing would be the metal gear solid remake and portable ops but other then that incredible.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|I dont often rate apps but this one has quickly become one of my favorites! Cant put it down! Very addictive.!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone I know who loves animals, especially cats. It is about a courageous personal journey and an unusual bond and I believe that every word of it is true. It has touched me deeply.
B00E8B1358|1.0|My husband and I enjoyed the first film but this film is barely passable as anything more than an excuse to cash in on the name GI Joe.  Where's the plot?  Where's the character development?  We quit watching after Duke (Channing Tatum) died which is about 45 minutes in and there was still over an hour of movie left.
B007N85POS|4.0|This one is lots of fun and a bit different.  Challenging with many levels to play and hidden extras (find the fruit).  My only complaint is after about 4 tries on a level the annoying pop up screen appears that keeps asking me to try using TNT.  Don't need this constant annoying reminder.
B00DU74U74|5.0|We liked this, sweet story, I think if you just go to the movies to enjoy a story and not get too deep you'd really like this. Not sure why the critics didn't like it other than they haven't watched much tv lately. She tells sweet stories that are exciting too, so glad my kids liked something like this rather than SAW 5000.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Never really got to play the game since it would not load past ( a long loading) video that introduces the game.  Installed on my Kindle Fire - but it was free so no harm.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I started watching SOA knowing nothing about the show and not sure I'd be into the whole &#34;biker&#34; thing.  I was so wrong!  THe show is so good and gets progressively better with each season, can't wait for 6!
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I enjoyed the concept a cop going crazy stuff to make the streets safer... or is he???  Nice balance of drama and action.
B003B02OOG|4.0|Expecting a typical Grisham?  Not here, or maybe this represents everything that IS typical of Grisham; well developed characters, poignant, genuine stories and a strong sense of reality.  If Grisham had kept a selection of his college essays and put them together, they could come together to be Ford County: Stories.  I personally love a good short story as it fits into my life and allotted time to read, I would recommend this book.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I always wanted one of these.  I really like this one because I actually have 3 tips in one.  As a student things like caps on pens sometimes get left on tables etc but what I like about this is that even if I lose the cap I still have a double tip stylus!  The clip is also very sturdy and stays where I put it.  Great price also.
B005UG53NS|5.0|Loved all. Harry potter except half blood prince. This was a great end to a great series. Especially like the end.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This is the perfect series for binge watching.  It gets better with every season. I can't wait for season 4
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Far better than I anticipated. Wow, just wow. Rotten Tomatoes and the critics failed yet again. Definitely buying on Blu-Ray. Not your biggest fan Tom, but boy did you knock this one out of the park. Great job. Good to know Hollywood doesn't always fail us.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I purchased this watch from Amazon 6 months ago and I couldn't be more pleased.  Mine loses about 3 seconds a day.  To me, that's a wonderful trade-off for not having to ever replace a battery.  I was a bit apprehensive about the band, as others have mentioned, but it still looks brand new.  I abhor metal bands, and I tend to wear out leather bands rather quickly.  It only stops if I don't wear it for more than 2 days, and even then it's easy to reset.<br /><br />Several people have also told me, \\"I REALLY like your watch\\"!
0894803123|5.0|Haven't made anything out of the book yet, but enjoying it. Eventually I will make the recipes. Everything sounds yummy.
B0030F5W5K|5.0|I already saw this movie once before, but I still love this movie.<br />Definitely a crying movie, especially because he is not here anymore.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Brilliant presentation and a pleasure to watch.  Packaged well and with additional content made this Star wars experience even more enjoyable.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A great work of fiction that centers around  NOT so great historical fact.  The last few chapters were really unexpected.  Easy read.
B00COO2D6O|4.0|Fun game and great time waister. hard to beat later levels without paying real money for upgrades. Good strategy game but if ur not really into tower defense games get the free version.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|This had to be a very expensive production , costumes and sets were excellent, as well as the acting.<br />I would watch 2 episodes a night
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a must-read for animal lovers....especially those who own, have owned a dog or deals with them in their line of work.  The better you know dogs,  the better you will understand this book and laugh at what the dog is thinking.  I read the last 5 pages over and over.....extremely touching.  I don't read a book once I have read it,  but this is one book I would read again.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|Have a hard time finding all the clues.  My grandson had me get it so he could play it he does better than me.
0375703764|3.0|This book is overrated. Some parts of it are crazy smart and intriguing, and (many more) parts are self-indulgent and boring. I loved the story about the house and the movie and the family. The narrative frame of the guy who found the book...etc...is boring and not necessary and indulgent and is probably why people in graduate school love the book.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|Excellent depiction of the inner workings of the political brain. Superbly played by Spacey. If you don't want to become a life-long cynic, don't watch.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Where are all the originals?????? When did duke die!!!! This could have been a great series...but they went to far away from what GI Joe was all about.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|This is more than the American version: more evil, more obvious, more tongue-in-cheek. Seriously, it is hard to compare the two, both highly enjoyable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|well. idk about u but I loved this app Bc I was able to b one of guru's servents aka minions
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved this season. The characters matured in a way that made them much more relatable, and seeing the emotional acceptance of outsiders was great!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I'm excited to implement the Secret in my thoughts, feelings, and life. Very grateful! I hope to help others have this joy in their lives too.
B0041T52S6|3.0|Got this as a gift for my brother and he loved it.  It's a little too strange for my tastes, but entetaining nonetheless...
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Andrea Bocelli has the voice of an angel. All the songs evoke good memories.<br />As always his music never disappoints.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Awesome fun action film and story line with great character development too. I can't wait to see the second film now.
B009G41CG2|3.0|Would like it better if it gave a hint when you are stuck. Most games I have played have something you can push to get a hint
B008G59IBI|5.0|LOVE THE ALBUM.<br />Great Addition the Green Day Library of Awesomeness<br />Another Great Hit!<br />Another well done Masterpiece<br /><br />99 REVOLUTIONS!
B00A8FXT8M|4.0|Difficult to explain how a pedestrian life can be the subject of such an interesting book.  But I was hooked from the beginning.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|this is a great movie to just sit and enjoy..no sex scenes, and gun fights....just entertainment.  I liked how it started out in black & white, then changed to color, just like The Wizard of Oz.
B000S1M9LY|5.0|Wallace has the unique ability to put the reader in the mind of his characters; reading becomes less like watching a play and more like assuming the role.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I thought the acting was great. there were many good lessons to be learned. from this movie. some sad parts also
B00821OX98|5.0|I found this Sci Fi interesting and relatively believable.  It has a good mix of the personal aspects of the characters, aliens, and plenty of action as well.
1451695195|2.0|., so I don't know for sure the authenticity of his comments or where they actually came from, but you can bank on this, there is a hell.
B002WJI65S|5.0|It's a stuffed &#34;animal&#34;.  The quality was great.  My little cousin loves Mario and was excited to have Goomba.  Aside from the obvious, that this looks exactly like a goomba from the game,  this inexpensive stuffed toy is tough.  We took it all over Milwaukee.  He flew off balconies, was tossed around, was tied up and of course stepped on...everyone knows that's how you kill a goomba.  And in the end this thing is still holding up.  Very well constructed, perfect for any Super Mario fan.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|After following John Mayer's career for years it is a pleasure to find that his talent continues to blossom into the truly professional artist he is today.  He has had his right of passage, proven his talent and will have a loyal fan always.
B001EN71CW|5.0|What can I say.  I love this series.  Firefly has a great balance of characters.  I love that the motif is sort of mixed with old western and space travel.  There's a great mixture of comedy with adventure and a little mystery.  You don't have to be a Sy Fy nut to enjoy the series because.  Part of me says it's a shame they ended the series so early but another part is happy it went out on a high note.  I highly recommend this series.
630460291X|5.0|One of the greatest movies ever made for the cinematic treasure they are. def something I've decided to pass on to others
B007M45PMU|5.0|Fantastic Album! Can't wait for their next one! Saw them as the opening act at a Dave Matthews Band concert in December 2012.  Have loved their music ever since!
B002ZG9800|5.0|One of the greatest movies ever made for the cinematic treasure they are. def something I've decided to pass on to others
B0081336FO|5.0|Sherlock is a perfect blend of classic mystery with modern science and culture.  I love Sherlock and I adore Dr. Watson.  I hope they make more episodes - SOON!!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Great game hard enough to keep it interesting but easy enough to be fun I would definitely recommend for hours of funfun
B003ITZBVI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and thought the storyline was better than most superhero movies, live action or otherwise.  The plot was darker than I thought they would go and that made it even better for me. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the superhero genre and a great storyline.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I was looking for the real game and got the help guide not good at all. Amazon need to step the games up can not find the real candy crush sage. Must have on my kindle fire hd .
B005LAII80|5.0|I was surprised to learn that this didn't do too well in the box office after watching it.  This movie was easily the best action movie that came out for that year. If you're looking for a deep plot it may not be for you.  But I didn't see many plot holes and the acting, action and special effects were great.  The whole cast fit in well and I absolutely enjoyed Karl Urban's take on Dredd.  I was also impressed that he never showed his face at all and kept it hidden under the helmet the whole time.  Very true to the character and showed he wasn't a typical, vain Hollywood actor.  If you like Sci-Fi Action or just Action, buy this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Hey guys if u love despicable me than you'll love this game!! Plus its free!! But fighting Vector is a little hard but you'll love it!!
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|This series is well written, well acted and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I highly recommend it!
B008ASGP3U|4.0|Rebus fans will like hearing from the crusty old detective again in another good Rankin yarn.  Lots of atmosphere and snarly bad guys.  I particularly liked the trips to the north coast of Scotland which seemed to me when I visited to be very far from the modern mechanized world.
B00005ABTT|4.0|We have chased down this &#34;Bond&#34; movie as it is not on the &#34;Official&#34; list of Bond Movies.<br />Connery left the series , when asked if he would do another Bond his reply was<br />&#34;Never again&#34; , hence the title for this movie. Not made by the &#34;Official&#34; franchise.<br />The film shows a lack of big budget, but hey ! it is THE Bond. Relax and enjoy it
B0042KA5EK|2.0|I only saw one episode but didn't care for the confusing story or how the main character Nikita looked like 2 different people in one episode!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love the App, love the Featuers, Love Mpoints, i have won 2 Amazon giftcards just for using this app. (Mpoints)
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Twists and turns everywhere. I Could not understand the title until the end. My kind of book. I have been looking foe a good murder mystery and this did not disappoint.
B0066WJLU6|2.0|Would not work on my ZTE Warp or ZTE old droid. it needs more compatability to be worth 5 stars
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm ready for the wedding. Maybe a family, what about Cary? A daddy? Is he ready I'm ready for her next book
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie several months ago. Left me feeling a little strange, with what type of movie it was. But it left me with interesting thoughts. My daughter thought I might like the book so I have about 20 pages left to go and the book makes me want to see the movie again. Great book, great writer. Will have to go look and see what other books they have written....
B000HZGCEG|2.0|I don't like the movie. Unlike Jurassic Park, the film does not do justice to the novel<br />Hard to believe that anybody will understand the plot without having read the book first
030746363X|4.0|Like it but there are several pages that you can easily skip! Sometimes the explanations are too lengthy and unessential. A lot of his tips are backed by scientific findings.
B000JQUMPI|4.0|Reading on your phone can be difficult, but this feature is nice and it's convenient to read when on the bus or in a waiting room.  I've been happy with this classic novel.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|This is one of my all time fave movies, always loved P & P but this version,there are so many things that are just awwwwwww warm fuzzy about this one
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Enjoyed the creativity and flow of this book.  Finished it in 2 evenings. Don't normally go for stories line this ('make believe) but ended up ordering another book by the same author.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|You think that you will be able to watch live t.v that is playing on your t.v at the moment. On this app it is only religious stations and weird news channels you've never heard of.
B003Y5H51K|1.0|After seeing previews on TV, I thought this would be a good movie.  Not so, it was a long, drawn out and boring movie and I would not recommend it.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|When I first got the app, it worked great and I loved it ; however , after awhile the videos would just stay on loading. I figured if I just shut down my kindle fire HD and started it back up then it might work again , but I was wrong.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I wanted to put this game on my G-2 Android phone for my grandkids, who loved the &#34;Despicable Me&#34; movies. It took about 10 or 15 minutes to download the game, which should have tipped me off.  The graphics looked fantastic and it seemed like it was going to be a great game, but when I tried to do anything after the initial video played it locked up my phone and I had to power it down to reboot.  Tried it a couple of times and the same thing happened, so I de-installed the game.
B001QXCYZY|3.0|i was looking for a mic with no white noise. this mic has alot of white noise though. whatever. im broke
B008Y6WMEY|3.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and thought it was good. Peter Sellars playing three roles was remarkable.
B006M9NI48|5.0|Loved it!<br />I'm going to put all my new skills to good use.<br />Watch me soar!<br />Watch out world, I'm here!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was very good all the twists and turns at the end it leaves you on a cliff hanger making eager to read the next book. I love how Suzanne Collins puts a twists on the hunger games making old victors enter the arena again. I never knew Katniss would go into the game s again. This is a great book your money won't be wasted.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved it! What a great way to end the series. When  you finish the brook you really notice how much the characters grew
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|The movie arrived on time and it was very enjoyable to watch. The movie was done very well and seemed very realistic for a small town taking of a bad guy.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I did not receive the 20 coins that I bought for a 1.99 and the site will not let me file a complaint. Then I turned around and bought (80) coins for 7.99 I didn't realize I didn't get the 20 and I didn't get the 80.  I feel like I got used.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Good suspenseful story. Lots of action and close calls. Another great Jack Reacher book. Has all the elements to keep my interests.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|Such a good app that almost everybody in my house has used it. It is so much fun to lay down and use it to snipe people.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really fun game! If you are a fan of Minions, this game is for you. The game gives you a chance to play with some of your favourite characters from the movie. :)
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I. Found it to be very entertaining and it occupied  some free space  in my daily  routine and kept me off my children while they played their games.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|it is a fun game to play if you like solitaire. it is a long game but it is fun game
B001NLKZUA|5.0|After loving [[ASIN:B00BAHB3G2 The Year of the Great Seventh]], an amazing fantasy novel free of vampires and werewolves, I had promised to myself that I was going to stay clear of any bloodsucking creatures. But when I came across The Mortal Instruments (Book 2) City of Ashes, I could not resist the temptation.<br /><br />I was a big fun of City of Bones as I thought it was a very original story. However, I wasn't sure how much more Clary and Jace have left to give. Putting my reservations to one side, I decided to go for it.<br /><br />City of Ashes revolves around the mysterious murder of Downworlder children in New York City. Clary and Jace are still obviously attracted to each other, but now that they know they are actually siblings, they are trying to repress their feelings for each other.<br /><br />When the Soul-Sword, the second Mortal Instrument, goes missing, the frightening Inquisitor thinks that Jace had something to do with the disappearance. Clary suspects that Valentine, Clary and Jace's father, is behind the Mortal Instruemnt theft, and possibly, behind the Downworlder children murder.<br /><br />There is nonstop action through the entire novel. The Shadowhunters continue to fight the demons that almost no one can see. Clary, her best friend Simon, and her now Shadowhunter brother, Jace are tangled in a complicated love triangle. Plus it is easy to relate to the characters even though some of them are half-human.<br /><br />If you want a captivating read packed with mythology creatures, romance and adventure, you'll love this one.<br /><br />I am glad I broke my \\"no more bloodsuckers/werewolves\\" promise. Ms. Clare: five glittering stars!
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|I lose track of time playing this game!  It's similar to Tetris, but easier because you can move the piece after it falls.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Interesting and entertaining story of an alcohol and drug impaired pilot who despite it all was able to crash land and save most of the passengers and crew on an otherwise doomed flight.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|As the Die Hard stoy this was good, liked the banter between the actors and action was great and was a fun movie to watch
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I began with Temple Run and once I got the hang of it..especially sliding under the obsticals, became addicted. Then I got 2 and noticed the better graphics immediately.  This is even more addicting then the first. I find that I have to put a time limit for myself or I would play all day! I am playing OZ now and enjoying it even better.  Can.t wait until Temple Run 3!
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|There was action but things just didn't seem to mesh together, no as good story telling either. The new people did not seem to fit as a group, more one on one not a team.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|You always hear about how dubbing the lush strings on several tracks ruined the album, but this &#34;naked&#34; album leaves me with thinking each to his own.  I like this and I liked the over-dubbed version.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|I did not really like this app too much. It required you to get very close to the kindle in order for the cat to repeat what you have said. So overall, I did not enjoy this app too much.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I found the movie to exceed my expectations. I watched enthralled during the movie. Unlike so many films over the last decade or so, the soundtrack was not overwhelming. You could easily follow the dialogue.
B00957T6X6|5.0|These books are written in great detail and with many characters.  Martin is a master at developing his characters and also at building plots that eventually overlap to bring about conflicts, resolutions, and more suspense.  I highly recommend these books to anyone who's interested in historical novels (though these are purely fictional).  The many twists and turns found in these books keep you on the edge of your seat.  It's hard to put this book down!
0307346617|4.0|I liked this book because it delved into issues of zombie-ness that I'd never considered. I wish some of the chapters had been longer but I appreciated his unique approach for such an overdone genre.
B0099114WO|5.0|fast delivery  good condition made me cry excellent movie  cost effective  one of tommy lee jones 's better performances would recommend to all my married friends
B001KZG99A|4.0|Fun. Good action. Fun story with a good plot and. Good ending. Great plot twist. Good first part of the trilogy.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|as the fifth installment of the die hard series..this was great  and held my attention throughout the whole movie...bruce willis does it again....kippeey kye yah  &%^*
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Although a lifelong Christian I learned a great deal from this book. His depiction of the times and the various sects, Jewish and Christian, were fascinating.  His insights into Paul and his relationship to the Christian community in Jerusalem are particularly astute.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|G.I. Joe: Retaliation w/Bruce Willis. This was an action-packed movie from the beginning. Totally recommended with some pizza and wings!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|First off I'm basically a mystery type but for reasons which life in its mysterious ways led me to this book and I'm so happy it did.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|UNO with friends is an awesome game, and great because you can play even if your Facebook friends aren't. More card games like skipbo and Phase ten.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game  buy it now it's awesome and it just got updated !!!!!!  Mooch o layer ))))  my recent is 365&quot;567
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I was very curious about this movie after seeing many commericals on Red 2.  I truly enjoyed this movie and now look forward to seeing Red 2
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I love this movie and wanted to add it to my movie library.  So I give this movie five stars.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I play this with my 4 year old and we both love it, I even play it after she goes to bed lol
B00992CF6W|5.0|my kids love playing it and comparing their worlds. Well worth the money, they have had it for a couple weeks now and have not gotten bored
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I downloaded this for I think my kindle fire or it's for my roku I'm not sure. Well the one on the kindle fire is ok but I prefer to use a server connection. It's not as good as the ipad one or even the android one. If its for my roku it sucks there's no interaction. It gives you sorta a look into your Facebook sorta. There is no way to write or follow. Simply it just sucks. Oh and delivery was instant lol
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Ok, now I'm just getting annoyed. I have been waiting the longest time for Candy crush saga to be available for the kindle fire! Come on! Why would I need the levels help guide if I cant even get the Actual game?!?! /: That is just rude.  Pleeeeeaaase just give the people what they want and add candy crush to the app store for the kindle fire.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I'm so happy with this book. I love it and the story. Action and satisfaction. Yes. It is worth the read.
B000IZ4R1U|4.0|Have seen this movie about 5 times. Like it a lot!<br />Rented it because someone hadn't seen it and they loved it as well.<br />When ISN'T Angelina fun to watch????
0786948523|5.0|More beast and bad guys than you can shake a Staff of magic +2 at!!! I haven't even gotten a chance to look at them all! Sometimes when I'm reading the stuff ill tell my friends \\"just look at it!!\\"
B00B49L7Y4|4.0|Not great, but good and interesting.  All of this information was presented in an episode of 60 Minutes BTW.  Watch that.
B0096PAA6E|4.0|But I should have read the label more carefully. It was in great condition and had some of what I was interested in.
0064471837|5.0|I was severely ill with CFS for six years, I was bed bound in a darkened room, too ill to read, watch TV or do any of the things I loved. I saw this book in a catalogue and it sounded really good. I decided to get it and when it arrived the cover was so beautiful (it was the white and gold version) I had to open to the first page. I read the first sentence, the first time I'd read in years and was hooked. I was still only able to read a sentence a day but I kept going, working through the novel over a year, slowly reading more and more, until I was reading again and loving it.<br /><br />This book is brilliant, well written, great story and characters. It will always have a special place in my heart and I recommend it all the time to people. If it old hold my interest over a year, then it will hold your interest too.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|Best Toy Story collection out there! The toy box is the cutest thing ever! Great gift for boyfriend, he loved it!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I have high expectations for this author.  I do.  I love his previous work.  This was good and I liked it, but I did not love it.  It's a good book, but it's not great.
193700788X|1.0|I was not amused by the way this book unfolded, the themes were very disheartening. Thank goodness I was able to get my money back for this book at least.<br /><br />I prefer not to give my money for a product or a person that supports slavery and segregation.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I liked these characters though felt they were totally unrealistic.  I would recommend this book though as a good read.  Funny and sad.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Amazing how a simple movie with 2 actors can be so powerful.  I became interested in this movie after seeing previews for Before Midnight.  I am glad that I didn't see the 2013 movie before the first two.  I would highly recommend this movie.  I am now an Ethan Hawke fun.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Neat little app with lots of information at your fingertips. Supports multiple cities with special alerts and warnings. Great to have with you.
B006RXQ1L6|4.0|I was prepared to see Charlize Theron as Roxie Hart, so I was really bummed to find that &#34;something&#34; hit the fan. Some kind of jealousy from another star ?  Still, the movie is quite wonderful. The Broadway show was great and Bob Marshall did not mess it up. There were some songs not used, but that happens. Nothing could be as bad as the transfer from stage to screen of Rodgers and Hart`s &#34;On Your Toes&#34;. Don`t check it out. You`ll kill yourself.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|This was soooo worth the money.  A long playing game with plenty of head  scratchers.  Not so many puzzles as it's more aligned with acquiring items in inventory and then trying to figure out how and where to use them.  No hidden object scenes and on a kindle the hidden objects games get old...quick!  This graphics are incredible. I won't spoil the ending but will tell you the developers have left and &quot;opening&quot; for a sequel * oh boy! *  Hurry up Mediacity and get moving on some sequels!  You hit the mark on this game! :-)
B000S1M9LY|1.0|I was really getting interested in the initial story line of this book....when all of a sudden there was a totally unrelated chapter that appeared.  I thought, o.k., there's going to be another story line....then, the author returned to the original story for awhile,  just when I got interested....boom, another, totally different chapter that felt like it had been pulled from another book...that continued as I read, until I said,  &#34;Forget it!&#34;  It was totally a waste of time for me.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I like to play Sudoku. I have had a lot of the books of the game but this one is fun because I don't have to turn the pages. Plus my cat loves to watch the numbers spin around.. So it fun in more ways then one.. I'll keep playing it. Plus I'll tell my friends about it too.
B00DH1G7DS|1.0|Input is cell then number with no way to change it. No options to set up the way you want to play
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Enjoyed this book immensely. I liked the way it was written. The writing kept you off guar, not knowing where the testimony was leading made for even more interesting plot.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I can't wait to read more of the lover's drama in suspense. Great read! Can't wait for the next book.
B0074VTHKM|1.0|I somehow did not see that this book was intended to children. What a poorly written, fragmented, simple plot. I just wish I had realized that this was intended for kids & not adult readers!
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I loved reading about how people lived in another time and era. The book was written so well that as you read the material it just seemed to flow.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|I have seen this film many times without tiring of it, as it's frequently on cable. There is non-stop action and Kate is thrilling as super tough Selene the Daywalking Vampire Warrior. The script keeps my attention and the production values are high. I thoroughly enjoy this film. There is nothing cheap about this film. I think it is the best of the Underground films.<br />There are lots of well done Computer Graphics. The actual Vampire gore is minimal.<br />Kate Beckinsale still looks great even though it is ten years since she made the first of the Underground films. She is very convincing firing machine pistols, exploding grenades and wielding swords. She really kicks some butt!<br />I highly recommend this film, it is one of my favorites.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is amazing ans super addicting. Can't put the game down for anything. Pick it up and play now!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really oved this season and watched it in a little over a week. Full of wonderful plotlines and great acting. Cannot wait for Season 4!
B000I8G594|5.0|This movie is great. Pacino's character is vulnerable and lovable. Johnny Depp is outstanding and the plot line is great.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|This guy is one of the best stories tellers I have read. Not only are his stories factual in their nature, but he tells them in such a way to keep you interested and satisfied throughout the book. I would recommend for anyone and everyone who knows how to read.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I like puzzles and this led me a 'merry chase'! I would like to read more about this bookstore. Lead on...
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It's sleek in its style, and plugs in easy. What more is there to say? Five more words to type.
B00433TO52|5.0|It's Shakespeare...what's not to love...reading it takes a bit of time but the flow always catches up and never disappoints.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This is my favorite show in TV.  I love the characters, all of them, the interactions between each other and the stories..
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|I like the creative use of the paintings to start a new set of games.  Hints are good but unnecessary as the games follow a logical sequence.  Definitely worth playing.
B004T0E2S8|4.0|we own this program (a lifetime purchase) for apple products  and had to buy it again for android . . . thus the reason for 4 stars.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This book gave a great insight to the war that you never see on the news. The sacrifice of our troops is amazing. The American people owe a debt we can never repay to our troops.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|This movie was such a let down and waste of time. I had hoped for so much more from this great cast. Don't waste your money on this one.
B0091VTISO|4.0|Although It Doesn' Have The Theatric Entertainment Value Of The Schwarzenegger Version, If You Are A Conan comic Fan, This Movie Is More Attuned To That Era Of Hyboria.
B007GE2H3G|2.0|Just not enjoyable. Myself and my three children were just bored to tears.  Two of them just fell asleep because how bored they were.
B005ILYW1E|5.0|I like every movie he plays in.  I wonder what he would do if he didn't make movies?  Gangsters, politicians, and football players make more money
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I think K Hosseini's novel was really well written.  I think that the ending was sad-but so totally believable.  I loved the way the characters had their lives entwined.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I found the author to be open and humble. A true professional more concerned about telling the true story than heaping laurels on his own head.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|I am at the age where these characters will be me in 35 years.  I went back several times to read the credits and look at the photos of the characters when they were in their prime.  I still think about it.  Excellent movie that makes you think about what is coming your way....if your lucky.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|Will watch this movie again. Was too bloody for any kids to watch. Wife would not enjoy it either, but I did. Terrific driving scenes.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|This album is beyond amazing. Too bad I got it 3 years later, but totally worth it!!! Haven't taken it out of my cd player since. Can't wait for the new album September 9th!
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|Pretty good movie. But may not watch it again. Once might be enough. Action scenes were good but acting was only so-so.
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|This movie had amazing HD quality. Documents Katy in an honest and emotional way which brings to life her struggles and triumphs as an artist. Worth a watch for any fan of KP.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|All the angry bird games are fun. No commercial interference lets me concentrate on the game. I love this game
B003XVYLDU|4.0|It was a great book. Just hard to understand at points. It has a good moral to the book, and j recommend reading it
B00D5CENXA|5.0|My third book by this author, and she's already been added to my list of favourites. 'Mountain Justice' is a sad short story about a lovely battered wife and her struggle with an abusive husband. There's love tendered by childhood memories and driven by sincere care and ready protection. In a situation when one questions the justice meted out by a legal system, love will always win out. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to relate with the struggles of the everyday life of other people.
B00B2270P8|5.0|I love seeing all the pieces of the movie they had to cut originally, added back in... excellent! Fun to see..
B004LWZVZC|5.0|It took a few factual liberties but nothing that took away from history, Robin Wright was incredible. Norman Reedus  looks so much like Lewis Payne it's spooky
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|I THINK THIS RECORD MIGHT BE THEIR BEST ONE SINCE WAY OF THE FIST ACTUALLY IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BETTER FIVE FINGER KEEPS MAKING BADASS RECORDS AND ALWAYS DELIVER THIS ALBUM HAS GREAT SONGS THT ARE FAST AND BRUTAL AND LIKE BURN MF AND DOT YOUR EYES AND  LIFT ME UP FEATURING THE METAL GOD ROB HALFORD BT THE TITLE TRACK WRONG SIDE OF HEAVEN AND M.I.N.E.(END THIS WAY) ARE GREAT SLOW SONGS TO CONTROLLING OUT THE MADNESS BT DNT HESITATE TO PICK THIS RECORD UP AND BUY THE DAMM THING DNT DOWLOAD IT
B00013RC8O|5.0|This is a great 70's movie - a cult favorite; with aspects of Easy Rider and Bullitt.  Though, there is limited dialog, low budget settings, minimal action, and only moderate acting talent; the thrust of the movie - and what makes it so unique and a cool flick - is the central character of Kowalski (Barry Newman), who bets a friend that he can drive a new Dodge Challenger from Denver to San Francisco in 15 hours.  We watch as his obsession with the road plays out and the characters he meets along the way.  His need for speed and his \\"tunnel vision\\" driving is fueled by pills he takes along the way to keep awake and to get high.  Naturally, the various state cops are after him, but only after he drives wrecklessly and breaks some traffic laws.  Meanwhile, a blind DJ (Cleavon Little), who has been listening to police scanners and \\"sees\\" visions of Kowalski's journey, soon turns Kowalski into a folk hero with broadcasts of his road trip.  The reason this movie is so fascinating to watch is for the driving... if you immerse yourself in the character, you can get caught up in the escapades and feel the rush of Kowalski's journey.  Everyone should see this movie... it's a classic journey that speaks to the soul-seeker and adventurer in us all.
B0046B6X1E|4.0|The opening scenes excepted, the acting in Carrie is far above the normal quality seen in horror movies.  The people we are supposed to hate, we really hate, and the people we are supposed to empathize with, we like a lot.  Good acting is behind this ability to identify with the characters and the situation they find themselves in. Sissy Spacek is able to have us love her and loath her tormentors, the mark of an effective acting job.<br /><br />The story well done with only a few dead spots (not a pun).  The story moves along fairly quickly through a couple of complex relationships to an ending that is surprising even if one can guess that the bad guys are going to get theirs in the end.  Moments of comedy are effectively mixed with hints of the coming terror.  After the climatic moments, we think, at the prom the story moves on.  This effective double ending (or maybe triple) became a horror standard after Carrie.<br /><br />Warning: the move is a lot of fun, but the opening scenes are of the girl's locker room with little clothing in evidence.  Other scenes with a naked S. Spacek do not add to the movie at all and could be omitted without loss.  Those with younger folks at home should review this movie before letting them watch.  The violence isn't graphic and confined to the last portions of Carrie.<br /><br />AD2
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Drew is awesome. He makes me laugh so hard and I think i am in love with guy's pov. I love this book.
0062255657|3.0|This popular magical tale left me mystified.  When I discussed it with a philosopher, the meaning and symbolism became apparent.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like how the tiles look, along with the colors. It is nice having the tiles in Chinese really makes you be observant to match them.
B000KQF6X0|5.0|I now have purchased this movie in VHS, DVD, and now in Blu-ray. That should speak for itself! I recommend this movie to,all!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its a very fun game if your thinking that's it like pc it isn't  although it is a little bit like pc other than that the game is fun.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Wild is the story of a woman's journey over the Pacific Crest Trail in an attempt to sort her life out after the untimely death of her mother. Strayed is an excellent writer, with a deft hand with words. Reading Wild was a visceral experience at times. I could see the beauty of the land she was hiking through, feel the pain and fatigue as the conditions took their toll. She doesn't sugar coat anything, telling her tale with brutal honesty. Her epiphanies and changes are subtle and slow in coming but by the end of the book you can see how she has changed. It is simply an amazing story and will almost certainly effect most readers, changing the way they look at life, their relationships or simply the world in which we live.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is grate for kids and adults alike. I wonder why this is free and I love that the adds don't take much space I virtually don't see then and it doesn't force you to buy gems. The downside of the game is that you need connection to play. I reccomend to buy this game and I hope you have a good day bye!!!
0307454568|5.0|The girl who kicked the hornets nest is a great book.  I recommend the trilogy for an excellent read, full of suspense and makes you ready for the next adventure of Lisabeth.  You will not be able to put the book down!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It's a great game that test the ability of your mind... it shows you how much you can connect two different things to make them one
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Love it. Glad they had the box set. Would definitely recommend reading. Glad there is a lot of books like these.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this this game. it makes you think and gets you going.I just love this game because of the movie too. it also calms me down when it my boiling point.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I would reccomend this app for anybody you can build light things on fire even blow things up it J's awesome
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Very engrossing book! Have read Walter Isaacson's bio on Einstein and loved it. He does not disappoint with this one!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob is well worth reading.  It has well defined characters.  The plot takes quite a few turns and keeps reader involved the whole time.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Really fun and keeps me entertained for hours. Lots of guns and realistic reloading. Worth every penny. You should buy it.
B000NQRR1Q|5.0|Here you have Polanski,Depp,and Langella ! What more could you possibly ask for??? Well, a fascinating story helps, I suppose, and that's exactly why I enjoyed this DVD. If you are looking for a well acted,well produced 'guessing game ' this is for you. Sure, it was a bit corny now and then,but,actually, who really cares when you can watch these professionals ply their trade. Definetly recommended.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|A beautiful show with a stunning and talented lead (all the actors on this show really bring it). While watching the show I had to remind myself that the clones were played by one actress. It is so interesting to watch the three clones interact with each other and wonder 'How did they do that?' The technology that goes into this show just makes you realize how far T.V. has come. A must for any sci-fy lover!!!
B009PAETCG|5.0|my son enjoys this soccer game very much.  He is excited to &quot;practice&quot; his skills.  great game for little fingers.
B000P407K4|5.0|This classic has to be one of the funniest movies ever. It's a true black comedy with Peter Sellers in a multiple-role tour de force. Don't miss it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of, if not, my favorite programs. I can't wait for season four. I loved that Amazon Prime had it available for free to their Amazon Prime customers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Yes - this is officially young adult fiction and I am far from being a young adult. Still, I was captured by the authors compelling characters and plot line from the first page.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Updated and more sophisticated version of the Running Game.  Excellent way to spend the time.  Jennifer Lawrence is outstanding.  Looking forward to seeing her other work.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I don't like it because it is cluttered with information and it is hard to manage what information you want to display and which information you do not.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Long time Sophie Kinsella fans, my wife and I found Wedding Night to be another home run. Loved the format of switching POV from one sister to the other. Took a little getting used to at first, but really made the book so fun and interesting. We were divided on which character we liked most -- I'm a Lottie fan; my wife is a Fliss fan. But we definitely agreed that the book was highly entertaining, loads of fun and even pulled at our heart strings several times.<br /><br />Highly recommend Wedding Night for hardcore Kinsella fans or anyone who's looking for a fun, entertaining read :)
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I dropped my newspaper subscription because it got soooo bad, too expensive and a waste of paper. I love that the articles are short, that there are articles from multiple sources and that I can save some of the information in my own magazines.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|This is an outstanding movie with almost a cult following......loved it and highly recommend!  It's better the 2nd and 3rd time you watch it!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have played this over and over. I have all levels opened with all vehicles at max. upgrades and now have 50,000,000 points with no place to spend them. It would be fun if they had a way to upgrade to more options once this one is mastered.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I enjoyed this, as I did the first two books in The Clifton Chronicles, but was disappointed by the ending.  I hope there is a sequel to make the ending clear.  I have been a Jeffrey Archer fan since reading Kane and Abel many years ago.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|This app is *not* a playable free app. :(<br /><br />You are given roughly 3K or less free chips every 4 or so hours. Unless you buy the £69.99 package which provides you with 2.5 million fake chips and this package *only* will up the amount of fake chips you receive every 4 or so hours. But believe me with 3K fake chips you can never survive the game (ie keep or increase those chips) unless you are max betting 9 lines in the smaller rooms (which give you nine potential routes of a win).<br /><br />So lets take an example: \\"OMG LOL\\" (which is a represented table for smaller bets) It requires 900 chips for a spin on max bet, and this will give you 3 \\"Yes\\" 3 spins to find a decent hit, then it is game over. You can wait for another 4 hours or so, or you can buy (spending real money) for fake chips. So when introduced to this game you cannot really play for a decent length of time unless you buy with real money. Imagine the price it would cost you for the larger tables that can cost 180K and 360K for one spin.<br /><br />I have wasted above and beyond an acceptable amount of real money on this application.<br />The increasing jackpot totals showing are not a real representation of what is actually being pulled in from people's bets, as when you do grab a power win (slightly larger win) the jackpot total is not decreasing by the win amount. (It still continues to increase and is just a set of numbers increasing at a timed rate and speed) So there is no way to know exactly what Big Fish are accumilating in people's real money, as behind the scenes it could be triple this amount.<br /><br />I have on occasions spent 5 million chips (which if bought without a sale - would have cost £140 of real money), and i didn't hit a big win. (and by big hit and mean a simple power hit - not the jackpot) In fact i was not in for more than 5 mins before the lot had depleated, and i had to yet again buy chips with real money to continue playing the game.<br /><br />Lets be real! This is not in any way shape or form a free PLAYBALE app - this is a very expensive app.<br /><br />They deliberately control the big wins on \\"X3 Sale Days\\"/ \\"Happy Hours\\"/\\"Bonus Days\\" to not provide the customer with any decent wins, and you can litterly lose over 10 million chips in minutes. The hit ratio is reduced to a rediculous amount and you simply do not win anything.<br /><br />It is about time the paying customer started questioning this application and the people behind Big Fish, as i feel that they are not at all being fair to the paying customer, and this is nothing short of stealing on Big Fish's behalf, as there is NO and i mean NO way to be successful on this game without it costing hundreds and thousands of real hard earned pounds.<br /><br />People do not mind losing money, far from it. We fully understand that at the end of the day this is a gambling app.<br />However you have to have a FAIR chance at staying afloat, and the bonus's, gifts, and actual payouts simply do not match fairness in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />They have now also DISGUSTINGLY added a pop up message, so that if you hit a good win (not the jackpot) during a spin (in the free slots) it will now constantly ask \\"Would you like to play for real money\\" To be honest i think this is unethical, irresponsible and downright setting people up to become proper gamblers.<br /><br />I love the nornal big fish games! But this one is just money in their pockets. :(<br />SHAME ON YOU BIG FISH - I thought you were more ethical than this.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|One of the best FAOTD!! I always wanted a scanner app for my phone but they were all expensive and had conflicting reviews. I like this one a lot because it's easy to use and the quality is pretty good. I use this for work and I'm on the go a lot so this is a great investment that I got for free! Thanks!
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|24/7, well known for their season versions of Mahjong and solitaire, has moved to Sudoku.<br /><br />I played some at easy and medium modes.  There are no settings, you play it as it is.  I like that when you tap on an existing number in the grid, it highlights all instances of that number.  You can tap on a little pencil icon to mark possibles on the grid.<br /><br />If you are going to have to put the game down, be sure to hit the red and white &#34;pause&#34; button in the upper right hand corner before exiting the app or putting it down.  This saves your mark ups and current position.  If you hit the red and white &#34;back&#34; button in the upper left hand corner, you'll exit the game and lose all progress and mark ups.<br /><br />If you complete a row or section, or find all nine instances of a number, the numbers do a little spin in place to celebrate.  I like that too.  In easy and medium modes, at least, you can't put in a wrong number, but trying a number that isn't right will add 15 seconds to your time (30 seconds in medium).  Yes, it is timed.  You get stars based on your final time.<br /><br />Graphics are clean and bright and I like the little dancing numbers effect.<br /><br />I had no problems with crashing on my Fire HD8.9. It also worked well on a Samsung Galaxy S2.
B005QYKD4I|1.0|Plot and characters are horrible.  It took up 11 series and ruined it.  It caters to the lowest common denominator.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Very easy reading. Excellent simple examples. Quotes th best of the best. Is the true secret of our magical creating powers revealed.  Very easy reading
B001BIMYXQ|5.0|A must have for any music collections! I'm slowly replacing my CDs to digital. Some have been loaned out the years so I've had but them again. So glad to find this and for only $5
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love it....ready for the next Room<br />.Good challenge for the mind,makes you think!<br />Good job Fireproof games...bring on the new one
0761163808|5.0|great coffee table book..people love to pick it up and look at the fun movement.  would recommend it to anyone
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not being a fan of the horror genre I never read a King book before.  I guess they are not all horror now that I have read this one. Loved Loved Loved this book.  Real history combined with time travel - the perfect combination for me.  It kept me up at night!  Then it sent me on a research junket to learn more about all the conspiracy theories.  Don't let the length discourage you.  A true page turner. I can't imagine anyone not loving this book!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Gritty and without the camp of Stallone. Fantastic action movie. Points to Urban for wearing a helmet through and still conveying emotion. If no one is looking at Karl Urban to play Batman in the 2015 movie, they should watch this movie. Perfect for the role.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Pam details in a funny yet direct way about the energy shifts she has achieved and her experiments are easy. She is engaging for the seeker.
B004CFAWK2|4.0|Very different from the movie. Many of same character's as in the movie plus some that weren't. This book will answer some questions about what happened to some of the Character's which were left hanging in the movie. It was very different in as far as the story line from the movie, almost to the point of having very little in common. It was very good though and yes have you tissue box close by.<br />Having said that. I would recommend it to others to read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game, and am surprised at how challenging it sometimes is to solve the puzzles and get all of the clues right to get out of some of the rooms.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|I read the books which give you more details than the movie. This is true though of most movies made from books. I was very pleased with it. It came in good shape as promised by the seller. I would buy from this seller again for sure.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Another great musical that is fun for the whole family!  Even small children have fun watching this one.  After watching this, you will be up beat and happy throughout the day.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|Zoom to char hightlight is a great away for a accurate selection when using a MID (even in a 10&#34; tablet).
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Funny and heartfelt. All working moms should read this, if for nothing else but to realize we are all feeling the same.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Got tired of only hearing a HL song occasionally on the radio.  So got this and listen and dance in my office. (when no ones looking)
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show is hilarious! Sheldon is a great character! Also having it this way, you don't have to wait for it.
B0018RFLN0|5.0|It was pretty good. Packed with action. Loved it from the beginning to the end. It kept us glued to the TV.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Definitely one of the best Pixar films. While our kids love it, we also love it as adults because the story has a great deal of meaning.
1451626096|3.0|It pains me to write this because I love Phillipa Gregory's work, but this book just didn't seem as detailed and interesting as her other works. In fact, the writing style even seemed off to me. It was very poetic and dreamy, and while that can work for a while, it gets a bit boring as the story goes on and that's all there is.<br /><br />There was a lot of drama for this period of the Cousins War, but it seems like she made some events more dramatic and skipped other ones entirely. The book's end was abrupt and seemed to come way too early. (If you're writing about the \\"white princess,\\" you should probably go all the way to the end of her life.)<br /><br />I still think Tudor fans will want to read this, but it's not as great as some of Gregory's other work.
B004AKCME8|3.0|The person I gifted this too love it.  I found it long and boring.Who, whooo who who whooooo woo wooo
B005544TRQ|5.0|Enjoyed watching Suits, season 1, can't wait to watch Suits Season 2. I know it will be just as good.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|The grand daughters (and myself) loved this one.  Very well done. Great artwork and animation. We love the curly red hair.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great app! Does just what it says, cleans up unnecessary stuff taking up memory on your phone! Best of all it does it free of charge!
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|On the desert level 3-1 when  you start it puts you n a place where you keep falling and you can't move because it drops you first before it shows the buttons
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Have been using this for about 6 months now. Haven't had any issues with it, and it seems sturdy enough to use. It just sits in my bag unprotected, but so far I use it mainly to transfer data between macs and PCs using the sharing and nothing bad has happened yet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are great on this game. It's sooo addictive. I would pay for this if it wasn't free.....I don't buy anything ever.
059306495X|5.0|BEST READ THIS YEAR...PERIOD!!!!!<br />Earlier this year I was introduced to Roger Hobbs novel \\"Ghostman\\" and mistakenly thought I had read the thriller of the year. But the year still had a few months to go and I stumbled upon \\"I Am Pilgrim\\" and my socks have been blown off big time.<br />Written in an epic form, covering various periods in the life of a deep cover spook, and spanning the globe, we see a real character surrounded by fully fleshed out supporting characters and a genuine story driven plot worth reading and fully believable.<br />Unlike the Clive Cussler/cookie cutter stories, this tale is original and unpredictable. Not since Milo Weaver, the Tourist spook in Olen Steinhauers series, have I met a spy I wanted to have a drink with and get to know on a personal level. \\"Pilgrim\\" is the spook I've been looking for after being let down or disappointed by repeated repeats of James Bond/Jason Bourne stories in written form. After reading \\"I Am Pilgrim\\" all I could see is the story playing out on the big screen. This is where it becomes obvious that the author knows how to write a screenplay. Frankly I can't wait to read the follow up books (as I understand it, this is to be a trilogy).<br /><br />*Who would I like to see as Pilgrim? Because the author, Terry Hayes, purposely fails to describe Pilgrim, it leaves the field wide open, though it should be someone not too striking and memorable, but rather an actor who can pull off intelligence and mystery, while being capable of more then he appears at first glance.<br />**Who should NOT be cast: Leonardo DeCaprio; Brad Pitt; George Clooney; Harrison Ford; Liev Schreiber; Tom Cruise;<br />**Who could be cast: An outstanding actor of any color or race, with or without hair, with the ability to become an 'everyman'.<br />**In the story, he's in his 30's, but I imagined him showing signs of mileage on his face and in his bearing.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|I really enjoy this CD.  It's rare to hear rhymes that are not corny. It's like hearing stars twinkling.  Can't wait for the next CD.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I might have been late on the band wagon to watch Downton Abbey, but the good news is that it did not disappoint!! What a great show, I am just disappointed that there are no more episodes until January!
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|My love affair with Boz began on a sunny fall day in 1971. I was driving up the main drag in the big city (Weatherford, Okla.!!) having just enrolled in college (SWOSU). Suddenly on the radio I hear \\"We Were Always Sweethearts\\". Something in me shifted and I was never the same again. I have purchased every single album he has ever produced. Can I explain how much I have always loved his music? I don't know if it's possible! I think the early albums, Moments, Boz Scaggs, etc. were simply spectacular. How could you not be spellbound by \\"Painted Bells\\", \\"Alone Alone\\", \\"Might Have to Cry\\", \\"I Will Forever Sing (the Blues)\\" and of course \\"Loan Me a Dime\\". It's his voice. He has a singular way of expressing emotion with his voice that can be nearly heartbreaking.<br /><br />I saw him in concert often throughout my college years (he toured frequently and always came to OKC). He never failed to put on a fantastic live performance. That holds true even today. I see him as often as I can. A couple of the best performances were at the vineyard amphitheater in the Bay area. He used to come to Oregon (were I live now) fairly often, and we would see him at the Autzen Stadium (Eugene, OR) outdoors...Wonderful!<br /><br />The album Memphis is another incredible work of art from a man who has been a REAL musical artist for nearly 50 years. Many of those years he was not given nearly the amount of respect and accolades he deserved. Thankfully he has a loyal following of people who love the music, many of them NOT even as old as I. My 24 year old daughter is a fan...has virtually all his albums on her IPod, right along side My Chemical Romance, The Black Keys, etc.! LOL.<br /><br />If you have only know Boz's music by listening to the biggest hits such as Lido Shuffle, Lowdown, Jo Jo, then you owe it to yourself to give a listen to all of his music. While those songs are great, they are not the best of Boz! There is so much more, and this newest album is an example of it. Soulful, bluesy, thoughtful and heart wrenching. The musicians playing with him are fantastic too and Monet and the other back up singers...well, just superb.<br /><br />If I could give this twenty stars I would because he deserves it. He has earned his place in music history. Wonderful Boz!!esy, thoughtful and heart wrenching. The musicians playing with him are fantastic too and Monet and the other back up singers...well, just superb.<br /><br />If I could give this twenty stars I would because he deserves it. He has earned his place in music history. Wonderful Boz!!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|THE place for any internet marketer to start, with a simple but never quick or easy plan for success. Not for everyone, and may not combine well with more complicated plans, but a great sample of how straightforward a plan can be.
1451627297|5.0|Could not put the book down. It is very exciting. The research he has done about 60 is great. It is like you are in that period.
