B001ANSSDC|5.0|Characters are well drawn, much better than the movie which was great. I am glad I read the book first.
B00407PNWO|5.0|I love this movie and I was bummed when my Warner Bros. 100 Movie Set DVD did not work correctly. This version is still great and the quality is awesome.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book was riveting. Hard to imagine this has been going on for over 50 years and i had no idea. Everyone should read this book.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Yeah, I'm a Trekkie, have been all my life.<br />Though I am loyal to all the Star Trek movies, let's face it: some are better than others.<br />This is one of the great ones.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|One of the best sniper books that I have read. What a shame Kyle was killed in real life. He would of always been a great man.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I've only seen a certain version of this and I'm glad I now have all the other versions. It's great!
B007HACDLK|5.0|As good as anything I've read recently, fast moving and hard hitting<br />Flynn to me is in a class of his own
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|Lots of fun, upgrades keep me playing more, certainly more fun than most of then other things you'd have done with the dollar.
B009JBZH54|5.0|i think this item is the perfect choice for anyone who like the batman, this three movies overshadow the others in the 90 and part of the 2000
B00AEBB9SM|5.0|The quality was great and the movie is still fantastic. I am glad to see it on my DVD shelf.
B005PK1G76|3.0|This is made very well and works great. However, if you are using the Baby Jogger City Select stroller and are using it with TWO infant seats (with adapters) than this will not work for you; especially if you want to use the cup holder. Eventually when i use my actual stroller seats and not the infant seats this will work but right now i can't use it because the infant seat gets in the way.<br /><br /> So this review is more for moms of TWINS.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It has cute graphics and interesting animals real and fake. I really like that you have to chace the animals down in your vehicle lol
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Have fun with it. I think this is a good summer/beach read.  It does keep you interested, but just not a &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34;.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Excellent book, quite different from the movie. watched the movie first and then read the book, loved them both. Enjoy
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|And why not? You tell a teenager: shut your mouth and don't show off. What's the first thing Four does? Throws a football like a stinger missile, fully knowing the school hottie-slash-unscrupulous photographer is watching him, with her camera on her lap. After the throw he looks surprised. Whaaaaaa?  (As as pretty sophisticated movie-goer I still couldn't figure out if this was new strength he had just come into or the director was just being lazy.)  In class, during 1950's documentary showing the detonation of the atomic bomb on the Bikini Atoll, Four's palms go from sweaty to glowing like halogen lamps. What does he do? Does he stick them under his shirt and walk quietly out of the room? No! He sits there. He gasps and stares and he carries on like he's having a grand mal seizure and then stumbles out of the room knocking down desks making as much noise as he possibly can. Is the kid brain dead from too much masturbating? Stupid? Undisciplined?  Disingenuous? \\"Legacies? Duh, what's that?\\" How can the kid be seventeen years old and have not figured anything out?<br /><br />This is what the screen writer thinks of kids as I briefly paraphrase some of Four's best lines: Duh? Huh? Whaaaa? ... I'm mad at you (surrogate) Dad! You won't let me run or fly ... but all these things are happening to me and it makes me feel awesome and like I could leap off a cliff, whew, did you just see that? I just did leap off a cliff! You're just trying to control me because you're jealous of me!<br /><br />You notice that Four doesn't bother to ask any questions; he doesn't seem to have any curiosity; he doesn't have any observational skills (there's an animal that's been following him around for his entire life and he's never noticed); he doesn't want to know anything about what he's supposed to do--all these things should be uppermost in his mind, not going to high school where he lacks social skills and is apparently a \\"D\\" student.  Here's another example of what a dimwit Four is: hefinds a box his father left for him (Easter egg for plot points in the sequel) and doesn't bother to open it. He moves it to another room, makes a telephone call, waits for his friend to pick him up and together they drive to the next state: but he does not open THE BOX. This is the most egregious case of editing problems in the movie and there are LOTS of them. A good editor should've cut out the box at this point. It adds nothing to the story. You start wondering: where's this kid's priorities? Look, while every body is dying and the bad guys are coming it's not like he's in a hurry to leave town, right?  Later he'll spend hours developing photos he claims \\"show who I really am\\" with the hottie in a dark room [\\"I Am Number Four\\" stops at this point and \\"The Notebook\\" takes over for an interminable 5 minutes--these scenes are the most excruciating I've ever sat through. Thank god for fast forward.] While Four's in the darkroom getting his--ahem--hand stroked there are at least four separate groups looking for him. The ones he knows about (the police and the Mogs) are just minutes by car away from him.<br /><br />And the alien enemies? The Mogs? Stock eeeeevil meanies: they scare fat kids! They drop mechanized torture devices down humans' throats! They look mean! And nasty! And clearly they have sinus issues. (Acupuncture could clear that right up, guys.)<br /><br />Oh, the wild card shows up, because clearly Four is such a dunce if he remains on his own he's toast. The wild card is a chick. She's cool but she's also hot. She's got an Australian accent ... or something ... She dresses like Olivia Newton John ca. \\"Grease\\" post makeover. She looks like she's fought in the Thunderdome and emerged victorious. Oops, the bad guys attack before anybody can compare playlists. These baddies--if they weren't scary enough we get to meet their pets: giant, frozen turkey-eating flying wargs. Sadly there are only two of them, I wished there'd been a whole flock of them. (The cops don't show up until everything is over which makes me assume that the director isn't capable of handling that many moving parts at once.)<br /><br />Explosion, explosion, explosion. Kill all the aliens. The End.<br /><br />------<br /><br />Wow, now that I wrote this I realize it really was a turd of a film.
B001OMJGD0|5.0|I really enjoyed this film.  It reminds me of Christopher Reeve's version of Superman and I think the actor playing Superman/Clark Kent looks a lot like Christopher and does a great job bringing Christopher's legacy back from the past.  I recommend this movie to those who're fans of the old movies.
B003FC3LQK|4.0|Reminded me of when I went to a summer resort and fell in love with one of the employees.  The music and dancing just great.  Story line interesting and so romantic.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|Cool movie
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is my passion.  I look for everything on Pinterest, recipes, garden, DIY, handy tips, etc.  I learn new things all the time and my family loves that I make new recipes all of the time instead of the same ones over and over.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|i am still on book one and watching the tv series as well, the book helps explain some of the stuff that the series doesn't - well worth the money
B009AMANBA|3.0|Learned more about Lincoln's  private life and all he had to put up with.  Daniel Day Lewis, Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones were superb
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|watched lot
B006LSZECO|5.0|just when you think you have the whole thing figured out it twists and turns and makes the reading fun.
B004B5W27Y|5.0|This is hands down the most beautifull album I have ever heard. First time I can actually say an album actually brought be to another world and almost had me in tears. If you can't appreciate this album I honestly don't know how you can appreciate any music at all.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I stumbled upon this show randomly and thought I'd watch the pilot. It was really funny and, well, awkward.  Highly recommend!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|never tired of watching this movie. Its simply mind blowing and i'm the money i paid for it. sipy awesome
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Proving once again that he has always been a writer ahead of his time, Stephen King conceived of youths vying for survival & stability for their families 'way back in about 1985 or so (when I read this book the FIRST time),  & my re-read was just as gripping as the first time around.  The Long Walk is as mind-blowing in its originality as The Hunger Games would like us to think it is -- without the extraneous glamourous touches.  King makes the very most of his limited palatte (100 boys hiking non-stop across the eastern U.S.) & presents us with characters we want to root for.  There's no romance, no diabolical technology, and no self-serving &#34;officials&#34; to get in the way (with the one exception) -- it's pure guts & rotting blisters all the way.  Just as The Running Man presaged today's &#34;reality shows&#34; with uncanny accuracy, so did The Long Walk presage (and out-do) The Hunger Games.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This was done perfectly. The fact that the actors actually sang while the camera was rolling made it all the better. There acting was carried through each song and it just added to the feeling of the entire movie. Be cautious though: you WILL want to cry. More than once!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love this book because it isn't the typical mundane romance novel.  Can't wait to read the sequel. Anticipation at its best.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|At times gruesome and at times thrilling. A great gangster story and good wins over evil. Great film, won't disappoint.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Fun little game. Nice flavor and doesn't let you just rush to the point of boredom,  could perhaps use a slightly. quicker energy timer.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Tarantino creates a film that is enjoyable on so many different levels. The acting is on point, the dialogue and characters are (as always with Tarantino) especially grand. Whether you love it or hate it, I personally give it 5 stars.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|abeit in his usually bloody violent way.  The movie was enjoyable and I found myself asking did that really happen in the South in those days.  I am at least one generation removed from the time period and growing up in rural KS, I couldn't help but be appalled at what I was seeing.  I am just not sure if it was one of those truism's Tarantino finds about the times to exploit.
B008BU75IQ|1.0|I enjoyed the first two books of this series, but was TERRIBLY disappointed by \\"Best Kept Secret\\".  I feel let down, and even angry, that I wasted my time in order to read to the very end, to see what would happen.  And did I find out?  I will not say, in order not to spoil the ending for others.  This novel was trite, poorly written, with not much character development.  I recommend that the reader avoid this third novel in the series.
B004H0M8EA|5.0|A complete analysis of failure of societies, why the fail and most importantly, some guidance on preventing ours from failing (hint, it's the environment, stupid!).  This is a book you need to read.  If you have children and want them to have a life, read this book.
B00B19DW0E|5.0|This movie is mindless fun. I enjoy it every time I watch it. Gotta love Snake Plisken. Always liked John Carpenter movies...
B003VBNN7C|4.0|This reminded me of the bar scene in my college days in KS, yeah, we had a great time-wall to wall people.  It was a cute story, provided entertainment.
B003B02O0A|5.0|This is the second best of all his books. His latest was reread within 2 days of completing the first read.
B0091THDOM|5.0|For the price you can't beat it. It serves its purpose for me and I love it. I approve this message.
1451695195|5.0|I love the way the author manages to convey his extraordinary experience through words. I felt that I grasped what he was trying to say and I do believe in his experience. The author also provides means to progress your insight and knowledge through further reading, meditation and a non-profit website which allows the experience of reading this book to live on in your life.
B0013UIUBC|5.0|As a self described foodie, this movie was enjoyable.  It didn't play too much into stereotypes.  Food for the soul and the heart.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Love this case.  Sturdy and just what I needed.  Love the feature that allows you to view your Kindle like a small TV.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Great app, love it!<br />Would recommend it to anybody,<br />I do billing counting on it, easy go back if you messed up.<br />Just don't like the advertisings, they annoy me.
B00881PTRC|5.0|I just love it and the different topic I do not think i could ever get to the end of this game .<br />Great past time
B00319ECGU|5.0|I always loved this series, and I bought this Blu-ray set to replace an older, 4 disc regular DVD set I had. Love it!
B0070XFNDE|5.0|Probably the best of the three in the series, but the first two we amazing. A must read for the summer
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|You just can't stop reading. If you are loooking for a book to be completely involved, this is definitely your book.
B00000J0O2|1.0|I bought this cartridge, installed it and threw it away within 5 minutes!  It left streaks and smudges all over my copies.  My first job out of college was selling copiers, so I know my way around toner cartridges!<br /><br />This product was awful!
B00BD62X14|5.0|If you are a Carla Bruni fan, (or even if you're not,) you will love this album.  It really does take you to Paris.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I've enjoyed this game but have restarted it three times after losing all my progress. It freezes and then it has to be reinstalled and it resets your progress. I wouldn't put any money into this game, you'll lose it when you have to reinstall it.
B00AZRBLHO|1.0|Unthankfully, I wasted more than a few minutes reading, skimming, skipping, and trying to read this drivel.<br /><br />If the author was going for the DevOps version of Tracy Kidder's classic, he failed miserably.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|LOVED IT!!! SUPER INTENSE. LOTS OF ACTION. HOT ACTORS. OVERALL A MOVIE I WOULD BUY TO OWN. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. WATCH IT
B0083EY9EI|3.0|Not as uplifting as I thought it would be from hearing the one track I listened to and then buying. I recommend you listen to all of the tracks before buying.
B00CFITJKW|5.0|il love the game but I think you should improve the graphics of the plane and the. pity and airport the game is good and has potential of being a really good game also the plane in the pic does not match up with the actual game I also think you should be able to choose weather you use tilt and touch and touch the all the game needs is better graphics
B005V5WBFG|1.0|I have completely stopped using McAfee in any form and shape.<br />Several of their systems would not work with my Microsoft 7 software and after McAfee spend two days trying to make<br />them work I have to take my computer in and have the mess McAfee created straighten out.<br /><br />also this app would not work on my tablet.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|I really enjoyed the film, but in the beginning when it first started i was afraid it was going to be kinda cheesy... it turned out much better!
B00CPM80HQ|5.0|Eight seasons and still one of most interesting shows on tv. Thank goodness for Amazon, because my DVR can only record so much at a time. I don't want to miss an episode.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I am only 25% of the way thru this book and I am impressed!<br />It is an amazing concept and the storyline is fantastic.<br />Hard to put down.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This show with its cast of characters just keeps on getting better and better!!<br /><br />This is a Must see season!!
B001KDQ4KQ|1.0|I didn't even want to finish the book but I felt there had to be more to this story. So dark and hard to comprehend.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I purchased this movie in preparation for part two coming out later this year.  It's a movie that plays well, what more can i say.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Ok, but not as good as it use to be. I liked the hourly reviews.  There is always room for improvement.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a great ,easy read. I literally couldn't put the book down. Now I can't wait to read more by Colleen!
B00B8WXFWE|2.0|I was really disappointed in this CD, especially after all the hype before it was released...  I was hoping for more songs that reminded me of their old stuff.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|Ended a little abruptly considering the 20 years of buildup. I think the personal situations could have been resolved a little better. Several questions remain. Was ok, but not overly satisfying.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I write. I write and I publish here. It seems very many self publishing outlets have their own rules and formatting requirements. Amazon is by far the easiest I have used. Even so I assumed I was right in areas of formatting that I was not right in. If I had read this book first I would not have published and then been embarrassed by formatting errors. Once I got the book I read the whole thing. If you plan to publish through Kindle you should read the book. Don't just assume that you know what will work. I found the information very concise and easy to understand and it solved my formatting problems.
193700788X|1.0|As many readers have reviewed, the ending is terribly disappointing.  The lack of continuity and abrupt relationship changes are so bizarre that they lead me to wonder if the author's known frustration with HBO's TrueBlood is behind such a forced conclusion. Written like a mediocre serial installment by a bored ghost writer, perhaps Dead Ever After is really Ms. Harris's literary middle finger to her publisher and to HBO for killing her creative control.  Too bad Sookie's fans that are the ones feeling the flip-off.<br /><br />I have been a fan of the series and especially of Sookie from the start.  I'll always appreciate the memorable characters Ms. Harris gave us, but the finale is a sore letdown.
B003PWH4JA|5.0|I had The 59 Sound first and really fell in love with Gaslight because of it. This is a different album and slightly different approach but I love it none the less.
B005LF9IO8|5.0|Waited a long time to see this movie and I wasn’t disappointed. The acting was excellent and story line was phenomenal. If you’re an action adventure suspense movie lover don’t miss this one.
B0012DT9VK|4.0|My eight year old really loves it.  Johnny Depp certainly has a brilliant performance in this movie.  We'll watch it again
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This movie is an excellent piece of cinematic work. One of the best movies of all time! The acting is superb, particularly Martin Freemans and Richard Armitages. I am very Excited for the Desolation of Smaug!
0762777931|5.0|I am fascinated with ways to live more healthfully and with more intentionality, but I usually like to read about healthy choices rather than act upon them. Inspired by this book, I followed the 21 day &#34;Adventure Cleanse&#34; with fidelity (except the visits for colonics). I felt like utter crap for 10 days and went through a whole host of reactions I could not have foreseen: sugar detox led to emo-melt down. After a week and half, I began feeling a kind of bright-eyed bushy tailed spark which completely lit me up. What I like about Kris Carr is her sassy, funny delivery sans pontification as she shares her story and her world views. As a society, we are really complacent about what we put into our bodies and we do not often think about the backlash. She unpeels the layers of our choices from a look at stockyards and the meat industry right down to the impact of our choices on a cellular level. Her zest for life is downright contagious and her book is a great little fire-starter. She cracked me up, the book is accessible, and I WILL keep eating more veggies. Her Crazy Sexy Kitchen is a terrific companion.
0399160450|4.0|Threat Vector by Tom Clancy with Mark Greaney. President Jack Ryan in the Oval Office; a former CIA agent and his son eliminate threats to interests of the U.S. Someone is working against them and their intelligence agency, threatening to expose them. Chinese experts in cyber-warfare launch an attack on the U. S. Chinese attacks escalate to satellites, dog fights and throughout the broad range of technology. There is much telling in narrative and at times it is not advancing the characters or story. Characters thoughts and dialogue could share more of the telling narrative or exposition advancing the plot. With suspenseful action the characters are believable and heroes work against fierce odds. A high tech thriller blending general military knowledge, realism and intricate plotting.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Very hard to put down.  It moves very quickly and is not predictable.  Read this book first and then the sequel, &#34;The Hit&#34;.  I am hooked on David Baldacci's writing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Lots of fun to play.  I have told several people about the game and they enjoy it as much as I do
B00005JK8K|5.0|I rated it a five because great service and with a great price. The movie was in great shape. It played great on the road. I will do business again with the sell.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Addicting, like crack.  This app is super user friendly and fun to use on my 1st generation Kindle Fire.  No quirks that I've noticed.
B004LZRSBY|5.0|So much fun listening to these great songs and remembering where I was when I heard them the first time.  Totally worth the purchase price!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Eaasy to use.  Many other people have down loaded the bible to their tablets and use them in church instead of carrying the Bible
B00BGIC4I6|2.0|Meadnering, endless, not especially funny.  Doesn't really need a longer review but this system is forcing me add words.  1 more...
B00004XMTJ|5.0|This is not only fun, but you can actually visualize the cats....I love this musical.  Thank you Mr. Weber, please make more :-)
B00CBRADU2|2.0|This was what we termed a cheesy movie. It had its moments of humor but not sure it was actually suppose to be funny.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Not as good as the original or RIO. You get too little variety in the game, each level is too like the one before it.
B008602KQI|4.0|I finally got to see this movie after reading the trilogy a couple of years ago.  I thought it was an imaginative story.  I like the casting.  The actors were well chosen.  I am looking forward to the next two movies.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Hi, i enjoyed this production a lot, however;  It would have been better had the actors chosen had a voice to match the acting. The young lady who played Cossette had a sorry voice, i am not happy to have to say, she needs voice lessons.  Crowe and Jackman did hold their own which was great.  Now for Fantine: could you not have found someone who could make the character less Hollywoody, and more 18th Century France?  Good movie!
193700788X|1.0|To say that I am disappointed with this book doesn't begin to tell you how i really feel. This series was the first book series I felt deeply in love with. I remember I would be so excited waiting for the next book to come out, and spend all day and night devoted to reading it as soon as I got it. I feel cheated out of what should have been an amazing ending to an amazing story. I will never read a CH book again in my life!
B006VJMZXY|3.0|I would recommend any of her books to someone with an interest in the history of the British monarchy. She certainly brings history to life.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|this is the 2ed best game ever cool cars epic gameplay the only bad thing is that the game haved bad and bad bad words!
B0063GORYU|4.0|For a free game it is perfect,  good purchase!!!<br />This suck giving a twenty word review, go ahead a get the app it is worth it.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a 55 year old female executive leader i loved reading this book and want my daughters to read it.  I made the choice to &#34;Lean In&#34; throughout my career and yet found words of wisdom that will still help me today.  Sheryl writes in a straightforward, yet thought provoking way that encourages the reader to become engaged.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This novel by Mark Twain is one of the many best classics out there. It is a novels that can survive in any time whether past, present or future.<br />I have rated this book with five stars because that is what it deserves. Not just because its a great story but because the order of the events and the chose of words and word scheme are absolutely excellent.<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone over the age of ten!<br />&lt;3
0061478784|5.0|I first heard of this story from watching the movie, so I'm new to Diana Wynne Jones, but I was not disappointed in reading the original novel; it of course fleshed out the story much better.  Very fun.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam Lambert put out a high quality album and I am so happy to have it!  Thanks also for the quick service.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a cute little game that will have parents always telling the children 'no you can't buy pearls'.  The game is all about building a little reef world for Nemo to attract more friends to live in.  The game will constantly give you 'needs' that you have to meet in the reef to protect it from sharks and other bad fish or to attract nice fish.  At times you will feel that Nemo, his dad, or Dory get to be a little demanding with so many requests that cannot be met with the resources immediately available to you.  When this happened the recommendation is to always turn over cash for pearls, sand dollars, and algae to complete the requests...some of these wanting $20 purchases.  One frustration is when the requests are there and the requirement is for something not available for a couple more levels (meaning hours more of play).  Try to explain that to a child.<br /><br />Out side of these minor annoyances, the graphics are great.  When new fish arrive the game will actually show them swimming across 'your' reef as close-ups which is pretty slick.  The graphics and display motion is fairly smooth and well detailed.  Overall a pretty game for all ages, just be prepared to tell the young ones that they can't buy stuff..
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Appreciate the layers in this movie. Themes of mental illness, family systems, treatment, assumptions, labels, roles and stigma in our culture. Weaved throughout is the pain, honesty, acceptance, and especially the beauty of growth and change that comes with living and of course- love, finding it where we least expect it.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|YOU CANNOT BEAT THE PERFECT HITCHCOCK THRILLER.  THIS IS THE ALL TIME CLASSIC MOVIE, WITH THAT FAMOUS SHOWER SCENE,  WOW!
B005HEVBGG|5.0|I enjoy star trek and have since tos I would give all star trek programs a 5 star rating waiting for the new star trek series based on the alternate reality created by the movie star trek
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Terrible quality picture, pale and fuzzy Was it supposed to be 3D? Plot was senseless. A total waste of time. We only watched a half hour or so...
B00BF11STU|3.0|This is a fairly engrossing account of the hunt to Bin Laden via the movies. The movie has a documentary feel to it and thus the cinematography is not sharp. Many scenes, particularly those at night are difficult to discern clearly. I suspect this was the intent of the film maker. Aside from the patriotic hurray associated with the death of Bin Laden there is nothing much to cheer about. It is well done for what it is and it may be enjoyed as a historical drama. It is reminiscent of &#34;Argo&#34; in this respect.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|This is the kinda of music someone can relax to. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes dubstep and classical music.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Fun, funny and real. Love the different stories and how they all came together.  Love the men's interactions more than anything!
B000JJSPXQ|4.0|Brought me back to happy memories of these songs. There are the most popular songs and some I never heard, nicely put together.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie with Tom.  I hadn't had the chance to actually read the Jack Reacher books but I knew some surface info on his character.  I found Tom to be excellent in his role inspiring fear, and projecting intelligence, craftiness, and always thinking 3 steps ahead of anyone around him.  Great fighting sequence when he essentially wrecks a 5 on 1 against him.  He does all his own stunts, as usual, so that applies to this film.  Some very impressive chase sequences and driving skill demonstrated by Tom, behind the wheel of a gorgeous Chevy.  Satisfying and explosive ending.
B001D09OAI|5.0|I know this movie word by word I think. I  just think its a classic baseball comedy and I love it.
B00849F82E|5.0|It's hard not to love this classic. I laughed way more than you would expect when you read a book from the philosophy/religion section. I suppose this is exactly what makes this book so beautifully unique. Chesterton speaks about profound things in a way that also makes you giggle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun. It's unlike temple run because you actually have daily challenges and in my opinion it is better. Just wonderful
B005BOHYW2|5.0|All the characters are strong and believable. The story line flows comprehensively and it is a compelling read. It is one of the best (heartwarming, without being soppy) books that I have read this year.
B00181JGI2|5.0|The first time I saw Lebowski, I actually didn't get it.  But I watch it again and realized that it's a contagious movie.  Once you get it, you can't get enough.  The Cohen brothers know how to perform magic...and this is one of their greatest performances.  Dude.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book.  It is about a dog and his owner and his family.  The dog is telling the story.  It will make you cry, make you laugh and make you mad.  I will never look at another dog without thinking about this book and what the dog might be thinking.  I think anyone would enjoy this book.
B0050DZN4K|2.0|I love feedly for my other devices but not my kindle. There are no pica with the post listings so a quick read is not easy because I have to click on everything. Hopefully they will fix this.
B002M9WW30|5.0|The Rocky movies are my favorite movies of all time.  The blue-ray is amazing making it even better.  Yo Adrian!
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Light hearted and entertaining flick for when you don't want &#34;deep&#34; and cerebral.  Good laughs and it's always great to se something that puts a positive plug in for weed.
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|This is a thoroughly enjoyable film for any Psycho fan! It features great performances by Hopkins as Hitch himself, Helen Mirren as Alma and Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh! The film centers itself around Hitchcock's relationship with his wife, Alma, and all the challenges (personal and profesional) they faced in order to produce and release Pyscho and that's exactly why it works, because it's a personal story and one can identify with the characters, especially with Mirren's character, who gives and outstanding performance, making Alma a crucial part of Hitch's life, but also making her sort of jealous and insecure.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to any Hitchcock fan, you'll have a blast watching it!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I'm a huge fan of the books and the TV series but this book? Garbage. It was rushed. It was boring. The characters are not the characters we came to love. Nothing was wrapped up in a cute little bow and ended. When I read the last line and realized this was the end of the book I was shocked. How does Charlaine Harris end a great series with this? It left more questions than answers. Eric, who was a major player through the entire series is written off and out like he was never a big part of Sookies life, like they never shared a tremendous love. It was disappointing and insulting. Sam, who has always been a friend suddenly becomes the love she's been looking for. Nevermind there was no chemistry built up between them in this book. We're suppose to forget everything we've read in the previous 12 books and accept this. We're left to guess where Eric's life goes. This big, powerful, 1000 year old viking vampire god just accepts his lot as a pawn and agrees to marry a vampire queen he doesn't want with nary a fight. Right.Sookie gives him up like she's returning a library book. Right. Speaking of library books, I wish I had borrowed this book instead of spending my money on it. This book is written like she wanted to just get it over with and didn't give a damn about the characters, her readers, her reputation. OR the series. It was a half hearted attempt..I feel like I should ask her to send my money back! It was that bad. Shame on you Ms. Harris.
B0081336FO|5.0|I enjoy the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes, but this modern day verison of Sherlock is even better.  Lots of mystery, drama, and comedy that will keep you on the edge of the seat.
B006C45MRE|4.0|Typical far fetched adventure film but an original and creative story.  Worth checking out if you don't want &#34;heavy&#34;.  Glad we watched it.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|I rented this for the kids to watch while we traveled and they liked it so much that they watched several times.
B000FC146C|5.0|I had seen the film when I was 18 or so and I read the book now, when I'm 50. I enjoyed it both times. The story of the forbidden love of a priest is very romantic. The only flaw of the book is that maybe it's a bit too long...
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Well Robert De Niro is an amazing actor and Scorsese is an amazing director so you should watch this. I forgot to mention everything else is just amazing too. 10/10
B002RPR6DU|5.0|If you love a good cheesy 70's SciFi flick, this one is worth checking out.  Its no Soylent Green or Andrometa Strain but a nice way to kill 90 minutes on a lazy, rainy day.
B00865P3AS|3.0|Less interesting music selection. Noisier and more distorted cellos are not so interesting. Less complex. If I had listened to it before I probably would not buy it.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I am really amazed that this book was such a huge success. It's one of the worse books I've ever read - or tried to read, because I was not able to finish it. The writing was awful, the passion was totally fake and the supposedly sexy scenes were just boring. It's not literature, it's not chick-lit, it's not erotica. It's nothing.
B007PS0X0W|4.0|For the most part, I like the Underworld Saga and this one is pretty good. It is still not as good as the first one but not bad.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Yes, I am a browncoat.  I am a Firefly fan, after you watch it, you will understand the browncoat thing.  Cowboys in space, or is it Space Pirates, Loads of misbehaving, crime and excitement. All without Aliens. &#34;Captain Malcom Reynolds aka Mal&#34; is played by Nathan Fillion.  Excellent role for him, and the rest of the characters are wonderful as well.  If you have never watched Firefly, you need to, it's a wonderful show and it was a crime that they cancelled the series so early in its developement.  There are 13 episodes.  Make sure to pick up the movie &#34;Serenity&#34; after watching this season, it is the final &#34;Big Episode&#34; and it helps to pull the story together with some history as to why things are the way they are. I have seen this series many times, and enjoy it everytime.  &#34;Kaylee&#34; is my favorite character played by Jewel Staite, she is the ships mechanic, so fun and sweet.  Then there is &#34;Jayne&#34;, played by Adam Baldwin, the tough guy, so funny and full of mischief. &#34;Zoe&#34;, played by Gina Torres is Mal's 2nd in charge, definitely an amazon woman, very strong and Beautiful. Then there is &#34;Inara&#34;, played by the beautiful Morena Baccarin, is the ships Bonafide Companion/prostitute. Zoe's husband is &#34;Wash&#34;, the pilot, played by Alan Tudyk, so funny! &#34;Simon and River Tam&#34; are brother and sister on the show played by Sean Maher and River Glau, &#34;Shepperd Book&#34;, played by Ron Glass..  Oh I could go on and on, but just watch it! You won't be disappointed.  One thing I'd like to add:  When the series aired for the first time on tv, they aired the episode &#34;Train Job&#34; first, then they changed days on the show, and times, skipped a week here or there, no wonder the show didn't do well, people were having a hard time finding it.  And then they cancelled it, only after airing 11 episodes, so 2 of the episodes in this series were not originally aired.  Ok, enough of my rambling.  Time for you to &#34;Aim to Misbehave!&#34;  Watch it!!!!!!  &#60;3to &#34;Aim to Misbehave!&#34;  Watch it!!!!!!  &#60;3
B00BLCHYKU|2.0|Boring. Lacks something. Disappointing. Would not watch again. No like original Vikings. Wasted my money.<br />Gabriel Byrne is always good.
B009R659L8|2.0|I used to enjoy anything written by Mary Higgins Clark. Not anymore...It seems like she has a recipe and just tries to write something interesting, but the result is boring.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Not a bad movie. Interesting theme of finding focus and the fear of being unimportant. Probably not for the very young.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|I grew up in Europe during WW II. I speak fluent German. I do not understand why Markus Zusak  could not use the persons first name like Liesel, He had to use all these bad words like Saukerl, Arschloch etc etc. All this name calling was very  disgusting to me.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|History , The true story enacted by good actors is always more exciting than fixtion. It seems as if Iran has been our enemy since its<br />religious revolution. Lesson for today's world
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|For those of you who have never seen Dr. Who...  You owe it to yourself to at least give it a try.  Each episode is like a thriller movie from start to finish.  Great story writing!
B00BZOD63S|4.0|This movie had creepy atmosphere and lots of scares and a surprise ending.  The background story could have been a little more substantial and explained a little better -- left you with some questions.  It sort of reminded me of The Grudge, but not quite as complex.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Wonderful heartwarming story.  Great cast.  Its a must see view.  Funny, sad all rolled into one.  This one is a keeper
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Fantasy, Excitement, Adventure, romance, mystery, political intrigue, betrayal dynamic change of locations, beauty, interesting personalities. This series has it all.
B0064MGU98|5.0|good acting; futhering character development<br />sometimes legal plots a little hard to follow, but still worth it.<br /><br />good weaving in of minority and racial profiling without being heavy handed
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  This film was heartbreakingly sad, and so inspiring.  It showed how the kindness of the human spirit shines through even  in the midst of horror and tragedy.  I would highly recommend it.
B00406O7YK|4.0|Oldie but goodie for rainy weekend with family. Was surprised at how much the kids enjoyed it. If a fan of musicals, a definite must see.
B00CLO3G54|5.0|very family friendly, fun for all.  Lots of belly laughs!  i recommend watching sister act (1), before sister act 2.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I suggest watching Thor, Iron Man, Captain America and The Hulk first to great a background on what's going on.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I was surprised, but in a good way, at how well this show was put together. My wife and I both enjoy sitting down and watching it after the kids have gone to bed. Can't wait until season 2!
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|Easy read but a bit light-weight on the story line.  Ten words required not much more to say.  Thank you.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|This movie is fantastic! One of my favorite movies now. Jennifer Lawrence is spectacular. Bradley Cooper does an excellent job as well.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I will preface this by saying that I will try, as much as possible, to avoid spoilers, but there might be some despite my best efforts. I also want to say that I am not disappointed in the book because of who Sookie ends up with, I saw that coming after the last installment, but rather how it happens.<br /><br />I have long been a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse series. Every release day I would set aside time to sit and devour the newest installment in one fell swoop. That being said, it took me three days to finish this one. Where before, when the real world intruded and I *had* to put it down, I was constantly thinking about what was going to happen next. I did not have that problem with this novel. I found it to be boring, inconsistent, and a poor ending to an otherwise fantastic series.<br /><br />Well, I finished it despite how poorly written it was. It was a complete and utter disappointment. This wasn't the Sookie that I had come to know and love over the years. If this were the beginning of the series I would have put the book down halfway through and never read anything else by Charlaine Harris. There were so many inconsistencies that I wanted to throw the book across the room (except my walls are horse-hair plaster and I don't feel that the book warranted me spending the money fixing a hole in my wall--whereas I would happily fix holes in my walls for George RR Martin.) At one point a character finds Sookie at a BBQ place with absolutely no indication of how he found her there. It was not a locale that Sookie visited frequently and there was no reason given for him to think she might have been there.<br /><br />There were several continuity errors as well. The author controls the rules of the universe they create. If they state repeatedly that Sookie can read shifters' minds somewhat, they should not change the rules in the last installment just to help along her Happy Ever After (heretofore referred to as HEA.) Ms. Harris also brought back a character thatshe previously stated would not be able to return, and shoe-horned him into the last chapters. Add to that the fact that this book also has hints of bigotry and homophobia that I was shocked and appalled to read.<br /><br />Then you have the Cluviel D'oh! It bugged me to no end that after books and books of Sookie not knowing if she loved Eric because of the Blood Bond that suddenly she was fine with the Cluviel Dor changing her feelings about her HEA. I also did not even remotely believe there was any chemistry between Sookie and her HEA. There was no build-up in this book to her last-minute romance. Not too mention, Sookie, up until this point, who has always tried not to jump right into bed with a character, constantly worrying that she might be considered sexually promiscuous, jumps almost immediately into bed with her HEA, who then proceeds to pressure her for more, despite the fact that she states unequivocably that she wants to take things slow. Plus I don't ever want to read the lines \\"he put on a condom and plunged in\\" or \\"the tanning lotion and the sweat meant we slid against each other like seals.\\"<br /><br />All in all I was gonna read the book no matter what, I couldn't have left the story unfinished. But what she did to the characters that she created broke my heart. Eric, in particular, seems to have reverted to his Dead Until Dark persona in the eyes of our protagonist, without any of the growth that he has experienced throughout the series. It seemed that this was done intentionally to justify Sookie's suitor end game. Many of the people populating this series act out of character with who they were in previous books.  The characters I have been reading for the last twelve books would never have given in so easily. NEVER. The last two books were depressing, but I went along with it thinking that it was leading up to an epic ending. Instead the series ended with a disappointing whiny whimper.<br /><br />When Ms. Harris stated that there would be an \\"unconventional HEA\\" I had hoped we would get an ending that really challenged the genre. Instead I got a story where the mystery seemed blase at best and Sookie gets kidnapped AGAIN.<br /><br />I would say that if you *can* pass on this novel, do. Then go and look into authors like Jeaniene Frost, Patricia Briggs, and Kim Harrison. If you can't, then pour yourself a good stiff drink and prepare to be completely depressed.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book was a heartbreaking book to read, but an inspiration about a beautiful loving strong young woman with amazing strength and courageous ability to adapt and survive such unspeakable torment, that no person should endure.  Jaycee is an incredible mom with the biggest heart and deserves all the happiness in the world for the rest of her life.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|I hate Facebook...I play on my kindle and not always able to go on FB either /  that's my story
B00CBRAD2A|4.0|Totally lacking in originality... but lots of shoot em up fun!  Entertaining 2 hours... Would be recommended to nostalgic Arnold fans.
B0094K1QR8|5.0|The movie wss very good ..Would suggest everyone should see it. I love the actors and the ending was the best.
B006TKP2B2|4.0|The dominance of genetic patent holders in food crops is carried to a logical extreme in Windup Girl. Very thought provoking and interesting to read.
B00980IA3M|5.0|I can't believe I got all this music for this low price.  The DG Tannhauser alone, bought separately, would have been around 38 bucks -- and I got ALL the operas for around 100 dollars.  The set has the Met Levine Ring with Hildegard Behrens, now sadly deceased.  The Parsifal was like hearing the piece for the first time.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|lots of twists was worth the time, and as usual Kevin spacy did a great job.  hope you enjoy it
B0095P33IW|4.0|Pretty good movie. Now I can watch all the other movies so I understand where they fit into the series!
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Jeffrey Archer is a master storyteller.<br />I have loved all of his Clifton Chronicle books.<br />The characters have so much that be related to and I got completely engrossed in the ups and downs throughout the story.<br />A great book!
B001UJSW7S|5.0|I don't know why this piece is not performed more often.  Everyone is familiar with the Mariettaenlied, but there's so much more there than just that.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game. Okay it every day. It's challenging and get to chat with people from all over the world. Nice job

1400052181|5.0|Like most Americans, I had never heard of Henrietta Lacks, whose cancer cells refused to die, and benefitted thousands of researchers and millions of diseased patients.  She died in 1951 at only 31, with five children, and this was a time in our history when black citizens were called &#34;free.&#34; but were still segregated, even in the hospitals, and didn't have the choice of when their own body samples were taken and used.  The drug companies continue to make millions from her &#34;immortal&#34; cells, but up to the writing of this book, her family has received no deserved recompense for the loss of, and use of, this lovely woman's life.  I hope millions read this book and influence the correction of medical history's silence and the great contribution of one unknown woman.  The author, Rebecca Skloot, should also be given accolades for her persistence in tracking down Henrietta's story.  She was inspired by one of her teacher's brief mention of HeLa cells.  The book was recommended to me by a lovely black 18 year old student.  (I am 66.)
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I love this book!I AM SO excited to read the next book : Throne of fire.(I think Carter is a better narrorrator )
B003K16P3M|5.0|I rated this four stars because as soon as I finished this book I immediately began looking for a sequel. I won't waste time reading a book that isn't good let alone a second book.  If you like action, adventure, with some romance, you will like this book.
030758836X|3.0|I purchased this book after seeing it on the best seller list for weeks. I was disappointed in the story but have friends who have loved it!

B008VVT51U|5.0|It was a great movie to watch over and over again. There's a different revelation each time I watch it.
B009YY91QC|5.0|I usually think HD transfers look only slightly better than their SD counterparts but in the case of this one... Holy Cats!!!<br /><br />Folks, this movie looks like it might have been released yesterday and if this gem from the archives of Classic Disney, featuring delightful performances from Phil Harris and Eva Gabor, not to mention an opening theme by Maurice Chevalier, is one of your favs then it's EASILY worth the price.  I'm so glad they remastered The Aristocats and here's hoping that Disney will do the same for all their classics.  :o)
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm not super overweight, I've just had 3 children and I'm quite squishy. I've been wanting to tone up and maybe lose 5 or so pounds, everyone says I look great, but I know I'm out of shape. So I bought this DVD and on that first day of level one, it showed just how bad off I was! I was sweating and panting like crazy before the halfway point! My body ached SO bad for the first few days, but it's totally worth it! My body got used to it a bit and I don't feel like someone beat the hell out of me, I just feel GREAT! I just started level 2 today. I'm seeing muscle tone in places I've never seen before!! It's not easy but I find myself more and more proud of myself for pushing myself to get through it. By far the BEST workout I've ever done!! I would for sure reccomend this to anyone looking to tone up and lose weight!! I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!!

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My kids really enjoyed this movie so much they're still talking about it especially my 2 year old. I enjoyed it myself and most of all I love to see them happy. I will probably purchase this movie in the future.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|really nice movie, although the start is pretty violent.<br />based on a true story, it is worth watching just for the fashions and the tough talk
B008XBHIEY|5.0|Of course Jaws is one of the best movies ever made.  This version just adds more good stuff to the original.  Love it.

1422188612|5.0|This is a revised and updated edition of a book I read when it was published in 2003.  Although much has (and hasn't) happened in the business world since then, Michael Watkins' insights are (if anything) even more relevant and more valuable now than they were then because the actions taken by those in a new role, especially one with more challenging leadership responsibilities, will largely determine whether they succeed or fail. \\"When leaders derail,\\" Watkins notes, \\"their problems can almost always be traced to vicious cycles that developed in the first few months on the job.\\" Ninety percent of those whom Watkins interviewed agreed that \\"transitions into new roles are the most challenging times in the professional lives of leaders.\\" They could be internal promotions, reassignments and/or relocations, or a new hire. These and other transitions are thoroughly discussed in the book.<br /><br />These are among the dozens of passages that caught my eye, also listed to suggest the scope of Watkins' coverage.<br /><br />o  Avoiding Transition Traps (Pages 5-6)<br />o Understanding the Fundamental Principles (9-12)<br />o Getting promoted (21-24)<br />o Table 1-1, \\"Onboarding checklists\\" (34)<br />o Identifying the Best Sources of Insight (54-57)<br />o Table 2-1, \\"Structured methods for learning\\" (61-62)<br />o \\"Emotional Expensiveness\\" (63-64)<br />o Planning for Five [Transition-Specific] Conversations (90-93)<br />o Planning the Expectations Conversation (98-100)<br />o Adopting Basic Principles (121-122)<br />o Avoiding Common Alignment Traps (141-143)<br />o Getting Started (146-148)<br />o Avoiding Common Team-Building Traps (167-170)<br />o Building Support for Early-Win Objectives (202-220)<br />o Understanding the Three Pillars of Self-Management (227-237)<br />o Table 10-1, \\"Reasons for transition failures\\" (245)<br /><br />The information, insights, and counsel he provides in this book reveal what he has learned thus far about what he characterizes as \\"The Vicious Cycle of Transitions\\" and \\"The Virtuous Cycle of Transitions.\\" The former involves sticking with what you know, falling prey to the \\"action imperative,\\" setting unrealistic expectations, attempting to do too much, coming in with \\"the\\" answer, engaging in the wrong kind of learning, and neglecting horizontal relationships. (Please check out Figure 1-2 on Page 7.)<br /><br />With regard to the latter cycle, the \\"virtuous\\" one, can enable anyone involved in a transition to create momentum and establish an upward spiral of increasing effectiveness. (Please check out Figure 1-3 on Page 8.)  To repeat, this updated and expanded edition develops in greater depth and wider scope the core concepts introduced in the first edition. The objective in 2003 remains the same now: \\"get up to speed faster and smarter.\\"<br /><br />Michael Watkins can help each reader to do that; better yet, he can each reader, especially those with supervisory responsibilities, to help others to do that. That achievement is indeed an admirable objective. However, we are well-advised to recall Thomas Edison's observation, \\"Vision without execution is hallucination.\\"cious Cycle of Transitions\\" and \\"The Virtuous Cycle of Transitions.\\" The former involves sticking with what you know, falling prey to the \\"action imperative,\\" setting unrealistic expectations, attempting to do too much, coming in with \\"the\\" answer, engaging in the wrong kind of learning, and neglecting horizontal relationships.

B009LMTDL0|4.0|I love that Sheryl Sandberg acknowledges institutional gender inequalities in the workforce but heavily focuses on overcoming internal hurdles, e.g. ways that women inadvertently hold themselves back by not &#34;sitting at the table&#34;...because it means her advice is immediately actionable! Anyone who criticizes her message for &#34;blaming the victim&#34; is completely missing the point. She's advocating for reform in both institutional and internal aspects...but is taking the approach of addressing the first step, which is having women reach for opportunities and, well, leaning in to their careers. I've taken some of her advice in my day-to-day and it's already having a positive impact on my career!<br /><br />Aside from providing pertinent advice based on grounded research, Sandberg also uses personal career examples, which makes the book read less like a stiff business book and more like a series of insightful blog posts. Even with all her power, success, and resources, she's able to make herself surprisingly relate-able. (Somewhat, anyways :).
8866137960|4.0|Cute but nothing special. Fits in my purse. Bought a little pen quiver for it. Feels like a pet. Never had a small Moleskine before but have always used and loved the large ones. But I do find myself writing quick thoughts into it at odd moments, Not business thoughts. Deeper thoughts, Hobbit thoughts? It's kinda pretty and does look like one that Bilbo might own,

If you enjoy Marvel movies than this is one you need to add to your collection as well as #2.  You should watch these before seeing #3 if you haven't seen the first two yet or the story line will be lost for you.

B000FBJFSC|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Angela's Ashes. It really opened my eyes to the hardships that many Irish people lived through.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Great story, Sanderson is building a world that I can't wait to explore. I hope he completes book 2 ASAP!
B008MZPVP4|5.0|The Purple EP doesn't disappoint at all how can you go wrong with songs like open coffin and misfortune teller
B00BHMETKC|1.0|This was a great movie, edge of your seat to be more specific. Great acting and although we knew the ending; the storyline was terrific.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|Many reviewers have called ADELE 19 &#34;a freshman musical effort&#34; and that her follow-up &#34;ADELE 21&#34; was superior.  Personally, I'd call them both a draw.  While there are a few more recognizable songs in the 2nd CD, there's a softer musical quality in this musical set.<br /><br />One afternoon I had a chance to compare both 19 & 21...and found myself wanting to listen to '19' a 2nd time.  The selections on ADELE 19 seemed to be easier to digest.<br /><br />Now that this fantastic artist has gotten an academy award for best song and has become a 'first-time Mom'...it'll be interesting to hear her 3rd studio album once it's released.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I read these books as a young adult to my children. There was even a game that went with the books. The movie followed the storyline & the effects were great.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|&#34;Musicals&#34; were about at the end of their run when this appeared. It had the right people, a good story, wonderful music, superb dancing, and it truly all came together.<br />Recommended for anyone who isn't dead.
B003JTHXN6|4.0|I had just finished the Jobs book, and this is a nice compliment to show a softer but still successful approach to business
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Love it! Michael Buble  rocks. We have been enjoying this album. The whole family listens to the songs every day. Our fave: Its A Beautiful Day.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I bight the game and paid for the pass for new levels, and for the next 48 hours I could not put down my phone.  120 levels later and I was so sad it was over.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|Love Michael Buble.  Great show tunes - his renditions of Sinatra's famous tunes are right on. Definitely a must have if you like Michael Buble.
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|I can hardly add to the praise already given, except to mention after hearing her magnificent playing on these two CDs, the bar has been raised, and I cannot think of hearing them played by someone else. This is artistry, real artistry, and deserves a place in your collection.
B00004TCPJ|5.0|Though others say that this performance pales in comparison with those (actually a particular one) from Horowitz's youth, I must disagree.  Yes, I can hear a difference in the age of the performer; but no, it is not bothersome.  The quality of this 1978 recording is nothing short of superb in this latest remastering.  It's a true thrill to listen to it and Horowitz's  performance.  You will stand and cheer with the audience at the end.
193700788X|1.0|I was so afraid that MS Harris was going to sell us out and she did.  The ending she gave, the book she wrote had absolutely no soul that I could feel.  I don't even care about the world of BonTemps.  She turned the Viking Eric into something completely unrecognizable from her first books.  Heck, she did that with most of the characters.  Sookie was a spoiled brat that complained that Bill didn't love her or want to commit and then when Eric offered it...she didn't want it...whah...I am throwing the books in the trash and will never read another series by Ms. Harris again.  She was not true to her characters.  It felt forced.  I am sorry, this story was just a huge disappointment.  I have never been more disgusted or less satisfied with a series ending than this one.  Never again.
B005BV0A44|2.0|If you like pop music, this is the one for you.  I like to listen to this album with my eyes closed and picture them headlining with Ratt and Whitesnake.  This was the beginning of really bad hair metal in the 80's.
B009ZQJVAK|4.0|This movie exhibits humor and poignancy as it tells a tale of traditions, innovations, and moving past one's biases.  When a up-and-coming young marketing major, Charlie (played by Joel Edgerton) learns that he has to return and take over the family shoe business, his first reaction is one of feeling trapped, yet again, in his father's dream.  It was a dream he never shared and now it has returned to haunt and confound him.  It turns out that Dad kept a lot of secrets, like the fact that there were no orders coming in. A huge warehouse holds thousands of boxes filled with shoes that had no where to go.  There is no money and no market for the kind of quality shoes his father's factory has made for generations.  Enter the gutsy young factory worker, Lauren (played by Sarah Jane Potts) with an off the cuff remark about &#34;finding your niche market&#34;.  Charlie, desperate for a way to keep the factory going and to create something for himself, recalls a chance meeting with a drag queen in a London alley. (It is not what you think.) The entertainer, Lola, is played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, who wraps himself in the role even as he drapes himself in satins and laces for a on-key solo act.  Boy meets drag queen evolves into boy enlists drag queen to help build a niche market for the factory by making outrageous and man-strong stilettos and high-heeled boots - &#34;The sex is in the heel,&#34; says Lola.  Bumps and grinds create obstacles, but as the boots are built, one stitch at a time, each character grows in synch.  The ending features a wonderful &#34;footwear show in Milan&#34;, only a tiny bit reminiscent of earlier &#34;turn the business around&#34; musicals of the Andy Hardy, Judy Garland, &#34;let's put on a show - we can use the barn&#34; era.
0545403359|3.0|War Horse is about a horse named Joey that gets separated from his Albert. Joey gets sold, to the Army, and is sent to battle in World War I. Joey wants to get reunited with his Albert but Albert is too young to go off and fight in the war. Albert makes a promise to Joey that he will find Joey. Joey meets a horse named Topthorn when he gets sold to the Army.  Joey gets captured by the Germans and is forced to work for them bringing wounded from the front lines. Joey and Topthorn are living with a girl named Emilie and her grandfather, where they are taken care of.<br /> I like this book because I thought the author did a good job from being a horse's point of view. This book is short and I like shorter books rather then longer ones, because it gets to the main point faster. It had stuff in it that I didn't think was going to happen but did.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This movie was a pleasant surprise.  With all of the high-budget blockbusters people are expected to see, it's refreshing to get a perspective of how life really goes. The actors are true to their characters and really bring to the screen a true emotion for the position they all find themselves in.  A definite must see to gain perspective of how simple small things in such dysfunctional environments can change your world for the better.
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|Stopped watching when Orcs were substituted for Goblins.  I may go back but Have no desire to view at the moment.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|The suspense continues ...I'm not sure how they keep the twists and turns going, but they do.<br /> I just wish it wasn't on Showtime since I am not paying $100+ a month just to get one channel!  I watch everything on Hulu Plus or Amazon Prime, have been cable-free for years.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I'm sure there has to be a way to figure it out. I was never able to do it so I deleted it from my Kindle
0062082353|5.0|I purchased the book before his death. The book was very good. It's a shame he had to die the way he did.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I am a fan of Michael Connelly and the Lincoln Lawyer series.  The story was believable and held my attention
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|A co-worker recommended this show to me, and I thank her!  My 16 year old daughter and I are completely hooked on it now!
B008I43DYU|5.0|I am so glad I bought this app. It is nice and large, and since I am a senior citizen it certainly helps
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I love the series Walking Dead. It just so happens that I missed most of the 1st. season. That is why I purchased it. It was very good.
B009VB97EY|3.0|But didn't think it was very very bad. Bordering on a vanity piece for Michael McCounghney. Interesting that this reflects real life experiences of the star.
B009B1UZ7C|4.0|The \\"new and fresh\\" UK CockTail. Ingredients: Bob Dylan, Rockpile and Fountains of Wayne with a twist and you got Jake Bugg straight up. I mean, I like it a lot. British American Folk in the XXI Century. Appropiate to say the least. Urban angst in crowded city. We all know that eventually more than half of the human population will live in cities and this will be some of it´s issues to deal reality and meaning to. Good first effort by a talented and simple man. Halleluya.....
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|We all gather around the Kindle to put our heads together to come up with the solution.  I believe it helps the kids with logic.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Really good movie. Excellent performance from all of the actors. Very moving and heart-warming story. Strongly recommend this one!! You won't be disappointed.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Star Trek is full of colorful characters you love from the very beginning of the movie to the very end. the Romulans in the show were great you haven't seen them in the Star Trek movie in a long time...J J Abrams spin on this successful sci fi series was one of my favorite Star Trek movie to date right next to the Wrath of Khan....
B0081336FO|5.0|Gorgeous show, gorgeous man, gorgeous scenery, and wonderful HD quality--I plan to watch again and again!  Can't recommend highly enough.
B0061S073A|2.0|Keep with the Kindle Free Time that comes with the Kindle.  This one did not work for me on the Kindle Fire HD.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is a great read. I couldn't put it down till it was done! Can't wait for the movie to come out!
B0091REZMW|1.0|I love adventure games, but the joy is in walking through the story and playing it as a story. This has lists of how many times you can use a tool, how much energy you have before you have to stop, etc. And if you are not into social networking and group gaming, just forget it. There are so many technical details to monitor that the joy of exploring is lost.  It took me only a few minutes to decide to uninstall.  Sooooo glad I didn't pay for this....stuff.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Jack Reacher is a hard to accept example of a real human, with too many virtues and with very extensive expertise in divergent areas, but the writing is sharp and exact.  The action flows well and is immediately clear and believable.
B0037YOMWS|4.0|Contrary to some of the other reviews, the quality of this unit seems above reproach.  The documentation supplied with the unit was not up to HP standards, however.<br />*** Update *** After about 8 weeks, unit is still solid and operates flawlessly.  The RPN mode is not quite classic HP XYZT stack.  Classic HP stack lets you square a number by typing in the number, hitting the enter key, which duplicates the X register into the Y register, then you hit the times(*) key, which multiplies the X and Y registers, with the results deposited into the X register. With the HP30, you need to hit the enter key twice in order to duplicate the X register into the Y register.  Once you know this, it's no problem to acomodate the differences.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This was the best movie that we have seen in years.  It had a great storyline, and was morally very very good.  We were so impressed.
B007R41E8O|4.0|This game is certainly better than some of the other reviews would indicate. I thought it was a lot of fun and worth the price. Looking forward to the next one.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatrual has eight  seasons and still going strong. This show is well writen, the story of two brothers who save the world from supernatrual forces is full of action antd laughs. Supernatrual is one of the few shows that I love every single episode.<br />if you love horror, you'll love Supernatrual. every episode is like a short movie. watch it, you'll love it!
B001TH16DI|5.0|These appear to have been remastered, I own the DVD's of this and this is SUCH and IMPROVEMENT in Video QUality!!!
B0071BGOJC|3.0|Sometimes too long and tiring but also better parts. Why should I wrtie more words I think I have said enough
B00ATPVA78|1.0|I really thought this was going to be a good one. It's just too glitchy.  Sometimes takes repeated tapping to interact with an object and it's hard to tell precisely where to place it, to get the action to take. I found myself repeatedly pressing the hint button, when I already knew exactly what to do, the game just wouldn't do it. Not worth the frustration. If this was a paid version I would be angry. Uninstalling.
B004LWZW8I|4.0|I enjoy these blood and guts movies with the ancient themes and characters.  I like the classical Greek stories.  I have watched it three times and will probably run through it a half dozen times relatively soon.  The cast is good and the plot, though familiar and well used in movies, is still enjoyable.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|The picture is improvfed over the DVD but I wish they would have cleaned up some of the low light scenes, they are still muddy.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|An enlightening option... to realize the fact that there is always direction intuitively  from within.  Trusting, letting go and letting the TAO flow.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I have really enjoyed this game but think it word be better if everything worked together and if you could use your seashells or other thing to buy pearls instead of money it's a kid's game everything in the game when you are low should not cost money . There are also extra bonus's and they shouldn't cost more point's to open then you have it should always cost you less points or pearls then you have to open them.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I have watched it several times and enjoy it more every time it covers a very difficult time in our history very effectively
B0094K1MH2|5.0|AWESOME! ! !  One of the best movies I've seen in a good while.  A must see for any adventurous boy who has a dog for a pal.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|All the Dr. Panda Apps are teriffic!! Very educational and fun. They keep my kids entertained. Highly recommend them all!!
0061900656|5.0|I got this book for my 3 year old son and he loves it!!!!  He wants us to read it over and over again.  It has started many great conversations because he starts asking questions about the baby.  I highly recommend this book!!!
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|For the first hour + I kept wondering whether I should just turn it off. It got better though.  Despite the slow plot, the cinematography is gorgeous and worth viewing.
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|Funny Movie;  I recommend this movie. Danny D. is awesome as usual . But the little girl is just adorable in her role as well.
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|My 2 1/2 & 4 1/2 love this game. It's super cool to watch them plant various things and make them grow. Highly recommend this one!
B001BKVWYG|3.0|I bought this CD after seeing the documentary &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34; The sound quality was not the best and the material dating from the sixties was a little dated. The movie was better.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I read Colleen Hoover's previous book, \\"Hopeless\\" and loved it so had to read this one also. Slammed is just as good!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I loved the names of the slaves and the language, the love they shared not only among themselves but also for their white &#34;family&#34;.  I loved the innocence of Abinia and how she just wanted to be loved; how she didn t see color.  The strong characters of Mama and Papa and what they had to endure amazed and saddened me.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|while reading this book I was sometimes thinking &#34;this cannot be happening at our times&#34;. the book reminded me about 1948 by George Orwell - but these things have been and still are happening!
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Susan Tedeschi is a powerful and soulful singer. She is backed up by her husband's band which provides perfectly matched accompaniments.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It kept me at the edge of my seat! I hope there will be a second book! I highly recommend it!
B00APUQH0W|5.0|I would recommend this movie to everyone. You just expect a great movie from Clint Eastwood and he delivered as expected!
B0097K21YW|3.0|I'm really enjoying this &quot;crush the castle&quot;-esque game. Flames from dinosaurs destroy the town with some power-ups and interesting interactive objects.<br /> My two star removal comes from the poor user interface. Almost every level requires you to be zoomed out all the way, but the game automatically zooms in when you start or restart the level. There are also mandatory power-ups every few levels which are also removed at restart and placed in the level so you have to tap them to acquire/re-aquire them.<br /> Great visuals and quick load times pulled me in. User interface killed it for me after fifteen levels. Thanks for the FAOTD.
0156027321|4.0|Ever since reading Kipling's &#34;Jungle Book&#34; in 4th grade, I have yearned to own a tiger.  This is the closest I've ever come!<br />The author convinced me that the story is true and I let know no one convince me that delusions, convenience, were the reality.  What fun would that be?
B005H9B44A|5.0|I only wish they would make more movies like this. great combination of legends and sci-fy. they should also make a sequel.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Loved..loved loved this season, actually loved the first 3 seasons! Can't wait for season 4. Definately worth it!!  Hoping season 4 Alicia gives Will another shot.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a touching story that is so well-written, but definitely have tissues handy. I can't wait to read John Green's other work.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|Please read the Kurt Wallander books in sequence as I failed to do that.  Each of them is riveting but this one is significant.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Very entertaining! Well written.  Look forward to the next Q title!  Laughing, while reading! Makes reading that much more fun !  (Not sure I want to see the movie, as movies usually not as good as the written text)!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app very fun to play highly recommended however need more pictured cards and more color chooses for background
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but it left me feeling that I missed something or something was missing.  Would be interested in seeing sequal<br />.
0385523912|3.0|The unfortunate condition of the lives of North Koreans and the unconditional worship required by inept and selfish leaders is difficult for an person blessed to live in a democracy to comprehend.  Very depressing.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Much to my pleasant surprise, after twenty years Rod Stewart is still kicking it!  Since receiving my preview copy from the One2One Network, I've been playing the album over and over.  I lost count of my favorites and know without a doubt many of the songs will make #1.  And to think that Rod Stewart wrote and produced 11 of the 12 tracks.  Don't want to give my age away but I was a huge fan in the seventies and I say this CD is the best yet we have heard from Stewart.  Like wine his talent as gracefully aged with Time and I can't wait to hear what more he has to offer.  It's very rare that a superstar of one generation can stay away so long and offer music that would fit in with today's generation.  He is just that kind of stellar performer.  Mark my words that \\"Can't Stop Me Now\\" and \\"It's Over\\" will be atop the music charts once this awesome cd releases
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|An amazing story how one person can effect so many lives. It should be mandatory watching in any history class of high school and above.
B007G5K066|5.0|excellent spy flick, a real cerebral thriller full of sober drama with a real cold war era feel, did not expect the ending at all!
0061537969|5.0|Will lead a discussion of this book in my book club; I highly recommend it to anyone, not just dog owners, because the author's premise is not that of a magical animal but a dog who solves problems by means within his canine reach and entirely convincing as a canine who happens to be telling us his story, thanks to the writer.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Great reference material. who doesn't need a dictionary from time to time. I have this on my Kindle Fire and use it regularly
B008BU75IQ|3.0|The first book of the series was offered at $4.99, so I took a chance. I enjoyed it well enough to buy the second one at regular price. (see what they did there?) I waited patiently for the third book, this one, and it is just ok. Meh. I'll read the next one, but if it doesn't improve, I won't seek anymore.<br />Not terrible, just not great.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|At first it was ok, but the horrible way people treated each other quickly became too much for me to continue reading.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|One of the best series since 24......great acting, interesting plot twists and realistic. Much better than most of the lousy picks available on broadcast TV....
193700788X|1.0|I have always LOVED the books (and the show) and would sit down and read the new books in one night. This one took me 3 days because I just couldn't get into it.  I only finished it last night because we had a storm and the cable went out.  All I could say after the last page was...\\"What crap!\\"  What was she thinking, or was she not thinking.  All the rest have been fantastic. Very, Very disappointed.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The ending of the book is interesting and different in a way that it is more realistic. I was disappointed since Katniss role is not very important in the final book. I mean she does not lead the revolution. After reading first book, i thought Katniss has started the revolution and she along with Peeta would end the iron grip of Capitol on the 13 districts. In that sense the book is very dissappointing. But if we go through the history of revolutions, most of them are started by someone and it will carried on by others. So i think the book tends to be more realistic rather than a feel good novel.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|What makes it so interesting to me is the clinical knowledge of the author in his medical field. The science cannot overrule the spiritual in this book. Quite amazing.
B004W2V254|4.0|I really liked this movie. This German production is of course spoken in German but the action is such that the captions just fade away and the acting grabs you. Well done and I have already recommended this movie.
0307591549|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1GN44B3R49PQ6]]Here is a short review of my experience with this amazing book. Both my wife and I love it. I think my wife has underlined probably 30% of it.<br /><br />Steve
B009E9R2OK|4.0|As a for the music it is very good.  I like purchasing HD audio and BR-audio is 24/48 and the disk as both the 2.0 and 5.1 mixes so that is a big plus.  I just wish there were an easy way to convert the disk to .flac so I could integrate it into my music collection.
B004GHYCC0|5.0|good opus , vraiment un album accompli, belle production , les amateurs et fans apprécieront. super univers
B00AN0KBJC|3.0|Our son let us borrow his first season of Game of Thrones on DVD. We liked it so much I ordered Season 2 from Amazon.com Instant Video. Usually there are no problems with AIV but I discovered one with this purchase and that is Closed Caption does not work with our brand of TV. At first I thought it was just me that I could not figure out how to use CC on our tv although I already have it turned on for cable broadcast. I found out after we watched the season that CC is not an option for our tv brand. In fact Amazon Instant Video supports hardly any CC for tvs. Unfortunate since I have tinnitus and need CC especially for those shows that use English speaking actors with heavy accents like Australian or Scottish I ended the trial version of Amazon Prime until they get CC fixed. Our son let us borrow Season 2 of Game of Thrones so I could watch it with the CC on - what a difference it makes.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Great movie about a great horse and the people who followed their love.  A piece of history that is worth watching, some director freedoms taken but still great.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a fun relaxing game. It would get five stars if pearls were not so difficult to get. It could be very easy to lose a lot of money into this game.
B0038N9WPA|5.0|good opus , vraiment un album accompli, belle production , les amateurs et fans apprécieront. super univers
B005IFWXWU|5.0|I bought this CD after seeing a interview of Hugh Laurie on TV.  This guy can really play and sing.  It was hard to believe that he is English!!!  Great CD if you like Mild Jazz
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It is a challenge, but soon becomes repetitive. I like the objectives also, but they soon become ridiculous in ability to achieve. Still, is better than most games.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF A GREAT LOVE STORY.<br /><br />IF YOU LIKE EPLACE THE TWO FOUR LETTER WORDS WITH F*** AND S***
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very entertaining! Fast paced and challenging. Love the graphics and the matching of three. Love the bonus pieces to get more time. Love evrything about this game.
B00BWTJ2WU|5.0|Great album! So nice to hear some new original music that &#34;feels&#34; so old. Glad I stumbled upon Rival Sons!!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Definitely one of the best books I have read yet this year. Liked  the book much better than the movie and we all know how successful the movie was. The book leaves the movie in the dust. Really enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to friends.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|REPLACE FOUR LETTER WORDS, TWO ,WITH F*** AND S***.<br /><br />GREAT LOVE STORY AND THE SAVING OF AN ABUSED YOUNG BOY IN A WAY THAT IS FANTASY SUUPER AND THE CONNECTION WITH MR.

B00CATSONE|4.0|Usually a lover of fiction, I downloaded this book for free because of my interest in Tesla. What I actually got was so much more : a fantastic read about the inner workings of genius and the beauty of creativity. I loved it and I learned a lot.  I will try to read more from this author and I will strive to practice my craft for 10,000 hours.
B009NY43NY|3.0|All along I have liked Sam and felt that he is the one Sookie should be with. He was the only one who didn't use her. All of the others wanted something from her. Sam was just there for her.<br /><br />What female wouldn't love Eric? I can understand the disappointment in his ending, but l can't understand all of the animosity expressed toward Miss Harris.<br /><br />I gave the book 3 stars because I think all of the characters were very lackluster. Usually they feel so alive, but here they were just there. The fun was also missing.<br /><br />I will definitely watch for future books from this author. She has given me many enjoyable hours of entertainment.
B0012HF5NC|4.0|A technically spot-on story structure works perfectly to create an exiting, if implausible, crowd pleaser. Sports fans must love this movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|THE OFFENSIVE FOUR LETTER WORDS F*** AND S*** COULD BE AMELIORATED WITHOUT MUCH DAMAGE TO THE STORY LINE BUT LIKE  A HENRY MILLER SOME OF THE STYLE ELEMENTS NEED TO BE USED, IN RETROSPECT.<br /><br />FABULOUS CLOSE TO THIS STORY.  FANTASY SEX HAS A PLACE BUT I BEGAN TO WORRY THE HUMAN BODY CANNOT ABSORB THE ABUSE THAT IS FEATURED.  I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM AN OB/GYN TO DETERMINE WHAT SUCCESSION AN D FREQUENCY EVENTS IS REALIZABLE..<br /><br />I HAVE DECIDED TO WORK OUT MORE AND SHED THE EXCESS FAT.
B000085RPU|1.0|This movie would not play in any of our DVD players, old or new, I feel it was some boot leg and I got ripped off
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Truly a great story... or should l say stories. I enjoyed it and them. Thank you. Very well written with a good ending.
1932907009|5.0|If you only read five books on screenwriting, this should be one of them. I find his structure formula extremely useful. Nobody has THE answer, but Mr. Snyder's entertaining book will lighten up the aspiring screenwriter and provide excellent tools to add to the writer's toolbox.
159420411X|5.0|This is a well written, easy to read primer on the power of statistical analysis and the need for more open data sources and more extensive use of this type of analysis.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|The story was gripping and kept one guessing.  However, the ending was very upsetting to me.  This would be a good book for students of psychology.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|From Start to finish,  A Memory of Light is an unrelenting book that keeps you on the edge of this amazing final struggle.  With amazing descriptions of battles to heart wrenching moments for every character, this book concludes one of the greatest fantasy epics ever with a phenomenal bang!  If you've stuck with the Wheel of Time for this long do not give up as the ending is incredibly satisfying and well worth the wait!
B009AJD5E0|4.0|Ridley Scott brings back the eerie atmosphere and sense of dread of the first Alien, but the story, even though I know what I'm supposed to know, leaves me confused during the experience.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|i sang from the rafters on every episode the first song was a personal fav since then ive been obsessed
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love this show...first season started off a little slow, but just got better and better as it went on.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Excellent movie with lots of action and humor, no foul language or sex scenes, which made it a great &#34;date movie.&#34;
B001TH7GT6|5.0|I have been using it for half a year now. No problems whatsoever.... and that's all you really want....and need....
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|but didn't love it as much as Jenny Lawson or Mindy Kaling. Still worth the read, but I wasn't as anxious to finish as with the other ones. Definitely funny though. My favorite section was about her Dad and what a badass he is!
B007RCJNDE|4.0|Thank heaven we are finally seeing the end result. So far so good. Lots of fighting etc but had to expect that!<br />It has been so long since the first book that I am having some trouble remembering the multiple minor characters.<br />All up a great story.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I've been playing videogames since Pitfall on Atari.  I've played and seen a ton of games and this movie packs in more videogame references then you can catch.  You'll have to watch 2 or 3 times to catch them all.  They even have a small LeRoy Jenkins reference!  Awesome movie!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Solid season. Good acting. Compelling story lines. In hindsight, while still great television, this season lives in the shadow of the 1st and 3rd seasons.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatural has taken my husband and myself by storm!  We are not horror movie watchers but got introduced to the show by our son.  The acting is fantastic and the relationship between the two brothers ( Sam and Dean) plus Bobby and Castiel keep us glued!  Family is everything and this show captures this to a tee!  We love it!!!
1451695195|5.0|This book is so well written and the subject matter is important to each and every one of us. Here is a neurosurgeon who had a near death experience who is also an excellent author! It does not matter who you are or what you believe, you will benefit from reading this book!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Well the boys did it again. I have loved all of their very interesting and edge-of-seat readings. Cost, packaging and delivery were just as offered.<br /><br />If you have not picked up a book by these two great authors, start with the first few, and I promise  you will become a life-long fan.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Great movie Angelina did a superb job in this movie kind of strange but overall a good movie pg 13
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Great movie...great cast. Very &#34;easy to hate&#34; villain. Enjoyed this movie a lot. Interesting glimpse into the &#34;moonshine culture&#34; of the Prohibition Era.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|My husband is a huge fan.  He loves Bob Dylan and his music and he was extremely happy to receive this cd.  Keep them coming Bob!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|The story line linked a lot of Bond's characters from the past and introduced the current replacements. The ending was unexpected.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|great movie but it does leave you hanging so you know there will be more. but the only thing is it is a long movie.  kids will like it but will lose interest because of length
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|Good acting, clever writing, and unique characters drive this very compelling story. It keeps you wanting more!  There's really nothing like it on television right now.  Tatiana Maslany deals well with the challenge of multiple roles.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Great movie.. I always had a great love and respect for our men and women in armed forces.. this movie only solidifies that. Must watch
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I do not know how accurate the account is depicted but it sure was interesting. I think most people did not know this story.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|Angelina did an outstanding job in this movie.  true life story very vivid not for kids under 15 but a really good Angelina flick
B00820N2JG|5.0|I love this movie. it's hysterical. they guys from south park couldn't have done a better job of making this movie. I remember seeing it a long time ago, and when i saw it online again i had to watch it.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Amazing movie. Great historical authenticity with only a couple missteps. Complex political issues very well acted out to explain those complex concepts and issues. You feel part of the Lincoln's  cabinet and  actually at those cabinet meetings.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|Gerard Butler's acting was superb and combined with the unexpected twist at the end it made for a really enjoyable movie.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Helen Hunt was great in this movie. very revealing too!!!!!! definitely not for kids under 15 unless you want them to learn about the birds and the bees in vivid detail
B0050DIWFC|4.0|When I first started this book I didn't know what to expect and it surely wasn't what I expected. BUT- it was a gripping book and I found I put myself inside the characters. How would I react in the same scenario?  This plot could happen to any parent. The ending was a surprise - right to the last couple of pages. I am glad I read it. Would I read it again- I am not sure. It was still a good thought -provoking novel.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Not only is this a good story, but it is extremely well written.  Its been awhile since I've read something that I enjoyed as thoroughly as WILD.  I'd forgot how enjoyable it is to read a well written story.  I delighted in the craft of storytelling as well as the story.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This, as well as the highlander books by Moning are fabulous! Great love stories, adventure, mystery. Definitely leave you wanting more!!!
B00594XOZU|3.0|An offshoot of text messaging.  I'm just learning how.  Difficult to edit when making typos.  Sometimes 'autocorrect' really messes up the message.
B009RI4ZKC|2.0|OK-- It is a wonderful glimpse at these huge stars stretching to do something more, and hey, this story is as far out or as worthy was any other random arbitrary story. But, I found the story line extremely uncomfortable and voyeuristic into a strange and demented personality of the hero and heroin. The movie is beautiful to look at and wonderfully framed in a technical manner, somehow reminding me of Hitchcock. I admire Bruce Willis, et al for their bravery to do this movie.  I wish I could get those minutes back into my life.
193700788X|1.0|Not because who Sookie ended up with. But it's like the book is written by someone else who doesn't really know the characters in this book. It's sad that all the wait for this book and the excitement that I (and many others) felt when the book came out was all for naught.<br /><br />Going for the love Miss Harris? Bet you don't really love your fans as much (as many of us had loved your work) but the money more from how sloppy this last book is. Just horrible.
B008Y768XO|5.0|This was a very good movie, but we showed it to our grandchildren, 7 and 9, and they went to bed sobbing.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love it, love it, love the game.  Like it better than Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons.  Loads of fun.
B000FBFMIO|5.0|I got hooked on the whole story starting at the Farseer Trilogy.  It was easy to get caught up with the characters and smile with their happy times and cry with their sorrow.
B00942G4UA|3.0|I almost went lower, but I figured there was just enough substance to the movie to make it a valuable contribution even if the direction was so heavy handed as to make it hard to take seriously.
B00004CZA7|1.0|I guess they expect everyone to know what Region 2 is referring to. Well it was a first for me, I had to learn the hard way. For those of you that don't know, one thing I can tell you is that this dvd will not play on any dvd players in the USA. The seller said I could return it, but they are in Switzerland so it would cost more to ship it than what I paid for it. Don't be misled by seller's names, such as \\"uniqueplace-usa\\". I assumed a dvd from a USA store would work in the USA. What was I thinking?!!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This movie was the best movie I have seen in a long time! Loved it!!! It was very enjoyable to watch, but a total chick-flick!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Fun game. Easy can move fast or as slow as you want. Have a few friends that started it. Great game
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Overall this movie was way to predictable and that made it just okay.  There also is only 3 fight scenes and 1 car chase and this fell short of what i expected considering the previews.  If you are looking to watch a pseudo action flick that does not at all have any surprises then this is your movie.  I did not fall asleep during it and it was late, which is why it gets 3 stars.  Worth $1 but probably not any more!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Works great! Only promble is u can't send gifts from the app. You have to use facebook for that. That is my only issue with this app.
0062238868|5.0|I understand that secrecy is key to winning battles, but the public were to find out much of these facts in time, and it's best for an experienced Navy Seal to be the one to recount it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Great writing, unique concept, riveting! Patrick Rothfuss has a way with words. His descriptions add to the drama rather than feeling like &#34;filler&#34; as with many writers. I highly recommend this book!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|My 13 year old granddaughter loves this movie. She has watched it over a dozen times. Her and her friends have learned the cups number from the movie and she can't wait for a sequel.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Max Brooks does an incredible job of writing with different voices in this book.  You really do get the feeling that you are reading about a past event that people have lived through.  I would recommend this book.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|This is like the 3rd or 4th time I've read this. I just love the story's and characters. I'll probably read it again next year, LOL.
B009GEYX5E|5.0|Even though the film was expired, I loved the color. It wasn't vibrant if that's what you're looking for, but it has a vintage touch to it and that's what I like.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Really enjoyed the movie as it showed in an entertaining way what the differences between reality and expectations are. Funny!
B0097K21YW|2.0|The earlier reviews on this App are great, but there's some confusion around how to earn metals and burn bucks. I've completed levels 1 through 6 and earned a gold medal on level 1 and silver on 2-5. The key seems to be speed. Fire your flames as fast as possible. The faster you knock down all buildings, the lower your time, &amp; the higher your score. You get 2 bucks for bronze, 5 for silver and 10 for gold, so I've made 35 burn bucks so far and you need 500 to buy a new monster. I'll never get that far.<br /><br />IMHO, you should be able to earn medals more easily on the lowest levels. I had to replay the levels several times in order to earn a medal. I also feel like rushing through the level takes away some of the joy of knocking down the buildings. Worst of all, the game has gotten tedious after only 6 levels. I'm likely to uninstall.
B00BF11STU|2.0|I had high expectations for this film. I was excited to see what the film makers did with this story, I expected it to be highly censored b/c of the military, etc and it was... but dude. There is now 2.5 hours missing from my life I will never get back. This movie was incredibly slow. I found time to cut my dogs nails and nip off my own hangnail during this film. The acting was good, I have to give it to the actors for trying to make a pretty weak script with 2.5hrs of run time work.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|The episodes had you sitting on the edge. Glad I did not have to wait week to week for each episode. Thanks Amazon Prime.
B00BFBSV72|4.0|I initially just bought this because it was on sale and a Sonic game, thinking I would be disappointed because it would resemble the vertical portions of console games too much. Surprisingly, it has pretty solid game play and it fairly entertaining. Certainly much better than Sonic 4 has been (and I played that as a Steam game. I assume the controls aren't as good for Android and iPhone).
B009NLC1D6|5.0|I thought this movie was very interesting, I enjoyed it. I was engaged from the beginning to the end. I found myself researching more about Gandhi.
B003VIWO9I|5.0|I've been in love with the Discworld books for many years, and he never disappoints! This book is no exception.
B009R659L8|5.0|ALWAYS EXCITING NEVER had a book of hers that didn't keep you not wanting to put it down  ....I think I've read them all
6305781427|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS I'VE SEEN IN YEARS<br />IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOUR MOM AGAIN GOD BLESS ALL
1556438850|5.0|This wonderful and in-depth book gives you a tremendous grounding in how to teach yoga in the Iyengar lineage.  While my yogic background is different, so some of the hands-on adjustments and Iyengar-style approaches to verbal cuing are less of an issue for me and my teacher trainees, this book is masterful and should be a serious go-to for any yoga teacher's library.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am a big reader but this authors writing style is horrible. I mean really please pick a different word to describe something other then the same word over and over and over again... the plot was fantastic but i just wish that it was written by a better author who knew how to write...
B00594XOZU|5.0|I've used a lot of texting apps, but kik is the best! I just wish more people had kik so I could message them... anyway, it's fast and creative, and one of the few texting apps that are actually private. And it's free! You don't have to pay a cent!
B000G8NY4U|5.0|SIMPLY &#34;AWESOM&#34; CONSERT, MY WIFE AND I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME.<br /><br />THANK YOU ALL, AND MAY GOD BLESS ALL
B009NY43NY|1.0|This book was a waste of time and money. If you want to gain loyal readers and followers as an author, you cannot phone it in in the last two books.<br />First of all, I pre-ordered. The day the book came out the price went down $2 - so I had to ask for money back. Shouldn't have to do that. Then, the book went nowhere. There was no substance. In the early books they would find a way through their troubles and around them in fun and intriguing ways. This book didn't do that. It laid down and waited for stuff to happen to it.<br />Charlaine Harris did a great job early in this series and for her to end it like this is insulting. She ran out of steam and creativity and is losing a reader. I'm disgusted with her and her publisher and their price gouging! ENOUGH already!<br /><br />GRRRR!! Still seething!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is one of the best written shows on television. The acting is great and Maggie Smith is awesome. The one thing that sucks about this show thus far, is the amount of time we have to wait for the next season.
B005OMOKN2|5.0|i am very like,thanksWhat is very good, I like it very much, want to often go to your shop later
B004YM6JI2|5.0|This is my all time favorite series...seen every episode from season 1 - 7 many times.  I love the Winchester guys...soooooooooooo hot !!!! Season 7 was great & I got it for a great price,  Now enjoying season 8 !!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Got a Kindle Fire so I could catch up on this show after all my friends were talking about this. Great decision!! Riveted by the show.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Excellent portrayals of what individual family members do on the events that this film is based on. Graphic, yet needed to convey the dire circumstances these family members find themselves in. Opens your eyes.
B0088P2A7A|3.0|Finding information on wikipedia is faster using Google. The app gets you there, but the search is slower than it should be.
B003PIUC02|5.0|It's a great show, Andy Whitfield performance as Spartacus is phenomenal, is a shame he couldn't  continue in the second and third season R.I.P.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Good game controls.  The story is interesting, fun gameplay.  I like the inventory customization setup.  Takes a while to level.  All in all a keeper.
B004HXIZVC|3.0|I downloaded this app, because, it was on my devise.  The instructions if there were any didn't help me at all have to do more research and then rate again!
B0052RDHTM|2.0|This book drones on so long with description that the story is slow to move anywhere.  Try the Wool series or Enders Game.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This series of books is awesome. Great characters, story moves and keeps you involved. I have read the whole series and love it. Read it. You will not be disappointed.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Great Music...I want more Lindsey Stirling!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I hope she has a great agent, she is going to be a huge star very soon!
B000N3AWDE|3.0|I love Celine Dion both singing in French and in English. I own and love her CD D'eux (from songwritter Jean-Jacques Goldman, ): it's a nice mix of upbeat and romantic songs. D'Elles, the feminine version, caught me by suprise...sad melodies, very well sang of course but just not what I was hoping for from these great female writers...still love Celine's fabulous voice!
B008BRC6NS|4.0|I only listen to like 2 of the songs on the whole CD, but I bought it for that reason because the radio station doesn't play them often enough.  This was in brand new packaging and shipped fast. The CD is in perfect condition.
1401311083|4.0|Naked Heat by Richard Castle was born from the mind of the fictional author from the television show \\"Castle,\\" but despite that dubious pedigree it makes for a fast-paced yarn filled with plot twists and shady characters. Fans of the show, of which I am one, should get a real kick out of the parallels between the world of the show and that of the novel and the cheeky cross-references between the two. However, if you've never seen or even heard of the ABC show, Naked Heat still delivers a murder mystery worthy of your time.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Dead Ever After was, as suspected, a total let down. The past few books had been subpar, but with this final book it's like CH didn't even try.<br /><br />I love the SVM for two reasons, mystery and excellent character development. The last few  books the \\"mystery\\" portion was easy to figure out, but in DEA there wasn't even a mystery. Everything was given and you just had to read how the characters had things revealed to them.<br /><br />The characters that we've known and love don't seem to follow their natural way. Everyone seems apathetic to everything going on around them.<br /><br />Everything just seems rushed and hurried to tie up loose ends. And Quinn being introduced in this book and quickly exiting made no sense, like the only reason it was there is so we know how Quinn is.<br /><br />Another thing I keep going over is how nothing is mentioned about the vampires and their good vs evil. Different times during the series Eric, Bill, and Sookie have discussed soulessness/the afterlife of vampires, wondering if God accepts them. Then when the book gets to touch on this (with a vampire getting caught by a trap, but a soulless person escaping the wards) they ignore that dilemma entirely<br /><br />Everything just leaves the reader feeling cheated.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|The CD came in excellent shape in in good timing. The CD itself is good to. Couple songs I don't love but that comes with the territory.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Visually appealing.  Intense action at some points that might not be suitable for younger kids.  But this super hero movie can bring it.  Our kids love it, even our daughter who goes around the house say &#34;Hulk Smassshhh!&#34;  Liked it enough to buy it, and we've watched it on Blu-ray, dvd, and on a tablet.  Worth getting the extra media for our household.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|How can you not like angry birds. It's perfect for keeping yourself amused instead of getting bored while waiting around.
B00AACHP10|5.0|FZ's guitar solos and Jean Luc Ponty's violin mixed together are great.The musical dynamics lure me in every time and the subject of the lyrics are both humorous and poignant.
B009ZM76J2|1.0|Boring and predictable--the children are of no interest whatsoever.  They are just silent throughout the film and it is thus hard to watch.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|This book shares some stunning insights into those years between 1936 and 1941 when the USA was wavering in its attitude toward Hitler, the position of the British, and later the desperate need for assistance to England as it stood alone against the axis powers.  It give fascinating detail of the struggle between interventionist and isolationist, it portrays in detail some major players such as Lindberg, Marshall, FDR, Rayburn, and the role of public opinion in foreign policy.  My affection and admiration for FDR was severely undermined by the facts presented in this interesting book.  Some parts were far too detailed and tedious, but on the whole was a worthwhile read.  The research was stellar!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|The movie is long and had a few &#34;slow&#34; sections, but overall the movie is fantastic!  Story, characters, acting...really good!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Hard to find a show that my wife, 12-yr old niece and I all REALLY like let alone moderately enjoy but we found one in Dr Who with the actors in Season 5.
B00284G2JE|5.0|If you heard about this band(through whatever channels) this is the record you need to listen to first. It's a lot more accessible than Dopesmoker/Jerusalem.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|We tried to see him in Atlanta recently. Variety Playhouse in Atlanta told us his show sold out in 15 minutes which is not surprising. This documentary is great. Notice how the record executive starts squirming and immediately tries to divert attention from the question asked him about what has happened to all of the money all these years from the record sales. Sixto is too nice a guy to ever sue him but someone should. What a remarkable human being Sixto is...sometimes the good guys do win.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|He's George Harrison and was a part of the greatest band ever.  There's not a whole lot more you can say about him.
B008S80PCE|5.0|If you're a Bill Withers fan, or maybe you've just heard a few tunes, Lean on Me, Ain't No Sunshine, etc., and you want to find out more, you too will be simply Delighted to hear what Bill has to offer. Great collection which includes live material, Live at Carnegie Hall; you'll really feel him on Grandma's Hands and Harlem/Cold Baloney.<br /><br />'Justments, with You, Make a Smile for Me, Can We Pretend...hey, I'll stop because I'd just end up listing every song.<br />Making Music - Sometimes a Song, Hello Like Before...and on<br />Naked & Warm - Naked & Warm, City of the Angels, Close to Me...<br />and on and so forth and so on.<br /><br />Treat yourself. Bill Withers is an American classic.
B009MYAQK4|1.0|This book was incredibly short and with a very undeveloped plot line.  Did Paulo Coelho really write this book?  It was not his best work at all.
B0095P29EG|5.0|Easily my favorite of the Avengers tree.  Well acted and nice plot with a great mix of comedy and action.  Loved the Stan Lee cameo too.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Always loved the Bee Gees and now it's too late to see them in concert unfortunately.  Got memories though.  Why?
B005D4YHP2|3.0|Heavier and more bulky than my previous Keen sandals. The sole is a little bit too thick. Sizes not same as older Keens.
B0085OEU1I|5.0|1st time I ever saw anything on this was watching Jersey girl. It intrigued me so I looked it up. I seen the original movie & this one. I want to see the play one day. This one with Johnny D. is awesome. Entertaining, funny (to me) and couple of toe tapping scores. I would recommend it highly.
B0046H95RM|3.0|I have enjoyed other books more written by Agatha Christie, I felt this book was written solely to display her genius in keeping you reading to find out who the murderer was. Otherwise a bit boring, sorry to say.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this bag the minute I opened it, you can change the layout of the separators and be able to customize it the way you want it. I can perfectly fit my DLSR w/lens and an additional lens plus charger and another underwater camera, camera cleaning kit, filters, etc. And still have a lot of space left, I'd say I've used about 30% its storage capacity. Maybe it's a tiny small for my back, I'm 6' so looks small when I wear it, but it's no big deal.<br /><br />Totally recommend this over the Nikon Deluxe Camera Bag.
B00846WWVM|4.0|My grandsons love trying to put out fires but I find the hose hard to direct. Nice for kids to use
B000MD9UJC|4.0|It was an easy conversion and works very well. A bit brighter than the tungsten bulb but not by much, at least the center is not as dim.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Liked watching this movie with my 7 year old son. The animation is really good and after watching it once I had to go back and watch with him again.
B007HACDLK|1.0|As always Mitch speaks for us all and handles situations in a manner we would love to see occur. And there is room for many more happenings.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie &#34;The Hobbit&#34;. It was so great to be back in &#34;Middle Earth&#34;. I thought all the characters were great.
1609611543|5.0|I had often wondered why I was addicted to bread, doughnuts, cereal, etc.  NowI know.  It was very informative and answered many of my questions. I have started not eating as much wheat and feel better..the cravings are starting to disappear.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun and can be addicting to horse lovers who aren't able to keep one of their own. I love being able to take my horses anywhere I go.  Lol we train while I'm sitting in waiting room at doctors.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I didn't read the full kindle book just remember a lot from when I was a child. I remember watching a story about it on tv and liked it
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I got this app awhile ago and it won't open up anymore so I can't play it. It's too bad I liked it.
B0097K21YW|4.0|Burn The City is an interesting game with distinct similarities to Angry Birds but isn't a 'clone' either.  Unlike Angry Birds, There's no story here and no motivation to destroy the cities.  And instead of launching birds with different capabilities, you are launching fireballs and occasionally super fireballs at various targets such as buildings, cranes, TNT, nuclear power plants, and so forth.  There's also a \\"battle\\" section that has you launching fireballs at moving targets.  Interestingly, there doesn't seem to be a limit on the number of fireballs you can launch; the only thing is that you have to wait a very short delay to launch the next one.<br /><br />There are slight tutorials, but that's it as far as instruction goes.  There are options here, to turn off elements such as the sounds and music, and even a speed setting with 1x, 1.5x, and 2x.  The music gets slightly annoying after a while, but its not bad.<br /><br />You earn \\"Burn Bucks\\" (without much explanation on how) to spend on buying other monsters, including a somewhat cute girl monster.  I know the Burn Bucks have something to do with the medals, but it isn't terribly clear how you earn medals, either, except it has something to do with the odd scoring, which isn't explained in the least bit. :c/<br /><br />I got through several levels of the first world, so I am unable to report whether the music or sounds change with the different worlds.

B006LSZECO|3.0|This book may not be for everyone.  The manipulative characters and unhealthy relationships in this book struck an unpleasant chord with me.<br />The book dragged a bit, and I had to convince myself that I had invested time to get this far so I should finish it.  I am glad that I did, as the ending was the peak of the manipulations of the main female character, even though it left me feeling disturbed.
B00AW57L96|5.0|I really enjoyed this book I liked the characters and enjoyed the way it is written I would definitely recommend this book to anyone

B0065GC0PG|5.0|This is a great book for both girl's and boy's.  Something I needed in my household.<br /><br />I hoped there was another book to go with Cinder.  And at the time that I bought Cinder, Scarlet had just come out!<br /><br />Marissa Meyer did well in her story writing.  The characters were very interesting and you can find who you like and who you love to hate!
B005K01VZS|5.0|I loved this telling of a faith journey!  It was very touching.  Mitch Albom grabbed my attention with &#34;The Timekeeper&#34;  and now I realized I really love his nonfiction style as well.

B004PGO25O|5.0|What I found so amazing about this book is that he basically says the same thing your mother always says. If you want to get ahead, you have to do the work. There are no quick fixes. I honestly don't understand people who want to get 'there' without putting in the time. When you do the work you learn so much.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|A very funny look at life and its every changing ways .really make you laugh to watch good rainy day movie
B00BT0ZS52|4.0|While it was difficult to get into at first because of the changing scenes, once you get into the rhythm of the movie its was interesting and thought provoking trying to figure out what it was meant to be all about.  Fun conversation starter.  Long movie, but we broke it up into two nights and that was nice.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|Clever structure, builds the tension and creates snapshots of the action. Well paced and fun to read. If you enjoy social commentary with zombies, you will enjoy this novel.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|This is a beautiful, courageous story of the Mexican painter's life and loves, her strength in the face of adversity, her defiance. Salma Hayek plays her beautifully.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is set back during the time of world war I. The setting takes place in a breathtaking historical English estate and mansion. The 2 parallel lives of the aristocratic family and their servants are depicted before and during a time of war. Real historical events are relayed in a whimsical real life fiction story with diverse characters revealing their many strengths and flaws. Excellent series that exhibits quality we rarely see on television today!!
0399213015|3.0|Good book. Small enough for a diaper bag, etc. Font is a bit small but over all okay book for the price.
B008602KQI|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence is fabulous! Wasn't sure I'd like the story, but it was very well done & I did enjoy it.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|dont miss it - hopkins and mirren on their A-game, a film about filmmaking and filmmakers worth watching, insightful to hitchcock's legacy, but more so into the influences of his personal life and the industry on his films.  bet you never knew how important his wife was to the succes and longevity of his career, right down to subtle details in some of his classic movies.  this is slightly fictionalized biography at its best
193700788X|1.0|THIS BOOK LACKS MUCH AND I HOPE THAT AT LEAST CH FINDS IT IN HER HEART TO MAKE THIS RIGHT FOR HER FANS AND IN ORDER TO DO JUSTICE TO THE STACKHOUSE SERIES...
B007549YM4|5.0|This movie is amazing.  If you enjoy post-apocalyptic movies, showing the depravity of mankind and the extreme measures to which people will go to survive or when left to their own devices, then you need to see this film.  It comes off as a run-of-the-mill end of the world tale based on the trailer, but what's inside is a whole lot darker and some really brilliant acting that isn't often seen on film.  For fans of movies like The Book of Eli, Mad Max trilogy, The Road or Children of Men, I highly recommend this; find out what happens to a group of survivors of a nuclear explosion, locked within a small shelter meant for 1, and how they begin to unravel, go insane, suffer from radiation, and give up hope.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|You can almost hear Richard Ford's southern voice narrating this novel of a teenaged boy caught up in horrific circumstances and ultimately dealing with his inadvertently becoming an accessory to atrocity, set in the bleak landscape of midwestern Canada. What gives the novel a Southern feel is the grotesque co-existing with the mundane, as though one isn't possible without the other. As a writer, Ford hasn't lost his touch in a novel that's perhaps a bit more plot-driven than I recall from his other novels. Writing is an act of discovery, which allows the characters, and therefore the readers, to experience insights. For me, these insights were less momentous than I experienced with Ford's other work, which is why I gave four stars instead of five. That said, a re-read might change my mind. He's that good.
B001P5M7QE|4.0|Actually my son purchased this. I guess funny stuff is always funny if you have the right sensibility to think Python is funny. A classic is always going to be a classic. Even teenagers today identify with this movie and quote it.
B0091VTISO|1.0|This movie could have been much with the $40 million budget it had to work with, instead, bad script, poor acting, and even worse CGI.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Breaking Bad.  Wow.  I had heard all the hype, praise, positive reviews and recommendations about the show, and was planning to watch it eventually, but boy am I glad I sure did get around to it.  It is seriously amazing.  Great acting, great writing, very dark, serious and yet comedic topics and scenarios that blend the perfect amount of humor, violence, shock and emotion.  The first season was absolutely great, despite it's short episode number (as a result of the Writer's Strike that year), but season 2 doesn't let up and shows the lives of the main characters get as complicated and crazy as ever.  Can't wait to see how it all ends.
B00068TJM6|3.0|This is my first &#34;real&#34; watch.  The styling is great.  The bracelet is nice and heavy and the polished center vs the brushed outside on the links looks very nice and isn't as distracting as I thought it would be.  Looks great. Lume is good.  Bezel is firm and easy to move.  Crown is nice as well.<br /><br />BUT, I do notice that the seconds hand for the chronometer and the minute hand for the chrono just donn't line up to center.  Yes, I've adjusted them per the instructions on the manual.  But there's just no way to get them set dead center.  By the behavior of the the minute crhono the gear seems to be out of alignment. For the seconds chrono hand it looks as the entire face is out of line. I mean we're only talking about measurements under 1mm.  But you'll notice it if you look at it.  Obviously someone else is not going to notice it.<br /><br />Just bugs me to death about it.<br /><br />I got this from JOMASHOP and delivery was super quick. Shipped in the morning after ordering the previous night. I will say this though.  I understand that it is grey market but the back and crystal did NOT come with protective plastic films.  It's possible this is a return but bracelet and SS metal pieces showed no signs of wear.  But then again maybe someone noticed that the hands were off.<br /><br />I can live with it.  But it will always bother me like an eternal zit on my face.<br /><br />Anyone else own one of these and experience the same problem alignment issues?
B00BETX5PS|4.0|It was an enjoyable movie -- much better than the last Daniel Craig &#34;Bond&#34; movie.  However, it didn't live up to &#34;Casino Royale.&#34;

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Very good read. A definite must.  I would recommend this book to everyone because it shows how to deal all relationships, not just love relationships.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Amazon recommended this movie for me, and, honestly, it was amazing! I needed to unwind after a hard week at school and home (please note, I am married grad student). My hubby agreed to watch something girly, and this was it. There was lots of singing, and Rebel Wilson was my absolute favorite with her ridic jokes. So if you just want to zone out and get a few giggles, this movie is for you!

B009NY43NY|1.0|Horrible ending. I feel as if the series is unfinished with lose ends. I am extremely disappointed. I have read this series for the last ten years before it was popular and wish I had stopped a few books earlier.

Here it is:<br /><br />☽This book is never ending.<br /><br />☽It bored me at times too.<br /><br />☽Some of the end notes were annoying.<br /><br />☽At times I read other books when I was supposed to read this book.<br /><br />☽Whenever somebody asked me what IJ was all about, I was unable to come up with a clear-cut answer.<br /><br />☽I skipped few lines here and there.<br /><br />☽I think those who haven't read this book or won't read it, would have more or less incomplete existence as a reader.<br /><br />☽I think those who have read the whole book and still think it's no good are..well...just normal I guess.<br /><br />☽No reason is good enough for not reading this book.<br /><br />☽In spite of best of my efforts my mind diverted to DFW's suicide.<br /><br />☽I had thoughts of trying marijuana (it's not really a big deal in India).<br /><br />☽After reading few reviews here, I got panic attacks due to their awesomeness.<br /><br />☽This review went out of hand and got a `bit' long, so oops.<br /><br />☽I don't want to say cheesy lines like:<br />-If IJ was a country, I'd applied for a permanent residency; or<br />-If IJ was a drug, I'd get high forever; or<br />-If IJ was a guy, I'd marry him; or<br />-I'm already missing reading it.<br /><br />☽I laughed when I said to myself after finishing it, \\"let me get my thoughts in order.\\"<br /><br />☽The good news is you can read IJ again and again. The bad news is, you Have to read it again.<br /><br />Here's what I want to say<br /><br />An Unexamined Life<br /><br />E.M. Forster said, \\"One always tends to overpraise a long book, because one has got through it.\\"<br /><br />Though I'm sure he didn't have a book like IJ in mind, but I agree with him to some extent. Reading a long book means devoting a substantial time of your life, a time which you value and there's no way one would like to declare that he/she/it spent that time on something unworthy. But when the book is Infinite Jest, then it deserves every iota of praise bestowed upon it. Its reading experience is something like the author takes your hand, makes you sit in front of a mirror and whisper in your ear, \\"now see the magic\\" and lo, you're sucked in by the mirror and the next moment you find yourself in a strange yet surprisingly familiar land and slowly the images, the scenery, the words starts unfolding themselves and you need to look out at each direction, else you'll be lost. You need to examine a life, which was left unexamined for a long time.<br /><br />Day of finishing Infinite Jest<br /><br />Jan 25, 2013 at around 2200hrs, I finished reading this book, closed it and put it aside. I stared at it for a while, then logged on to goodreads, gave it 5stars, put it under my favorites shelf and asked myself, \\"Well what was that all about?\\" There was no answer in response but just an echo of words:<br /><br />to write something that stabs you in the heart. That pierces you, makes you think you're going to die.<br /><br />Day of starting reading Infinite jest<br /><br />There was a loud knocking on the door. I wasn't expecting anyone, drowsily I thought. On checking that the time was 2a.m in the morning, I exclaimed! certainly not at this hour. I reluctantly went to answer the door. An adolescent boy of around 14yrs straightaway asked,\\"Do you want to get entertained? Huh..what the..? I banged the door on his face and went back to sleep. Few hours passed and a sudden sound of some commotion broke my sleep again. Annoyingly I came outand Goodness Gracious Me! there was this whole tennis court in front of me and two players were busy playing. There was a group of boys snorting coke. On the opposite stands, some kind of class was going on! I recognized it was Arthur Ashe stadium, but couldn't place the players. I looked at the score board: Wal and Fed. Wal was apparently leading with 6-3, 7-6, 5-3. All of a sudden somebody tapped on my shoulder. He was the same boy. This time he handed me a book. It was so heavy, that it made me fall from my seat. I woke with a start. The alarm of my cell phone went off at that precise moment. I checked the date. December 1, 2012. I said to myself, Of course!<br /><br />The days in between<br /><br />Over the period of almost two months, I read IJ every day. Having read Girl with curious hair and A supposedly fun thing.., I experienced both fiction and non-fiction writing by Wallace and loved it. It proved to be a boon, coz if nothing else, the disjointed stories in IJ were something like short stories from Girl.. (although a lot more developed and maturely handled) and the long ramblings on different topics reminded me of essays in a Supposedly fun...so Yes! Reading Wallace's other works before attempting this book did help a lot more than I expected. There was something that made him work for me, which not only provided enjoyment but became a great source of knowledge and information.<br /><br />He is one writer about whom I read a great deal about for reasons quite apparent. He dominated most part of my reading year gone by and I'm sure a repeat would happen this year too. Amidst an ongoing group read, reading some great literature (other than this book) and various conflicting opinions w/r/t its content, plot, structure, etc, etc, I have found a book that shall remain with me both physically and emotionally throughout this modest and unexciting life of mine.<br /><br />Infinite Jest is not a work of a genius. It's the work of someone who was all set to change the definition of word genius as we know it. He created a world that was consistently dark, desolate and most of the times demented but also witty, ingenious and oh so funny. This magnum opus is incredibly challenging but at the same time surprisingly accessible. It won't let the reader sit back, relax and enjoy it. It's no beach read but want its readers to sit up and take notice about what is going on. You can't afford to lose focus and track but the probability is that you'll lose both anyways. It's that kind of book, a literary equivalent of mobiusism, a never ending quest, a once in a lifetime experience. By expressing all this, I'm in no way glorifying its completion by me, but simply stating the facts. It's not possible to overestimate this book.<br /><br />Wallace took the most wretched situations and characters and created such amazing backdrops, that in spite of everything so seemingly hopeless, he would still be able to present you with a glimpse of hope. In face of lot of desperate moves, he would teach you a lesson or two in patience. With so many impossibilities going on one after the other, he would tell what all is possible if one try to do just one thing: realize.<br /><br />His prose is exuberant with less scope of comfort. He won't surround you with the sea of beautiful flowing writing to make you feel that he has stated something profound but rather something relentless and contemporary that you're in a position to relate in both subjective and objective way, no matter how insane that way is. You'll lose count of neologism, solecism, colloquialism, malapropism, and many other -isms DFW employed within IJ, which not only proves fascinating but gives you an idea about the extent to which he allowed himself to experiment in order to say whatever he wanted to and you'll see how effortless it all looks as if DFW was telling something that's always been there and getting our attention by a simple psst-look-here expression. Dave Eggers in his wonderfulforeword rightly stated: A Wallace reader gets the impression of being in a room with a very talkative and brilliant uncle or cousin, who, just when he's about to push it too far, to try our patience with too much detail, has the good sense to throw in a good low-brow joke.He has employed an allegorical structure to this novel and develops it to an extraordinary proportion taking cues from many of his influences namely Joyce, Pynchon, Shakespeare and Dante to name a few.<br /><br />I don't want to indulge much into plot(s), but just a brief and my practice in brevity, if I'm allowed. IJ primarily takes place in futuristic USA circa 2009-10 in Boston city. The setting for majority of the narration is based at Enfield Tennis Academy (ETA) and Ennet House, a drug and alcohol recovery house, where majority of the interesting characters reside, situating nearby ETA. ETA was founded by James. O. Incandenza, an avant-garde film maker, whose wife, Avril Incandenza heads the academy with their 2 sons, Mario and Hal being the current attendees of the ETA while their eldest brother, Orin being a previous attendee, now a punter in the NFL. Orin is a jerk, Mario is great and Hal is lonely. Avril is beautiful, very tall and delusional about her kids; James was taller, committed suicide and knew his kids just too well. He created a film known as The Entertainment, titled \\"Infinite Jest\\", which rumored to have 'qualities' such that whoever saw it wanted nothing else ever in life but to see it again, then again and so on, rendering its audience fatally addicted to it. The quest of finding the master copy of this entertainment marks the entry of a group of Quebecois separatists in the book, known as Les Assassins des Fauteuils Rollents a.k.a Wheelchair Assassins or simply A.F.R, who wants to obtain a copy, which they called Samizdat , because of its lethal qualities that would make them dangerously powerful to meet their extremist goals. This group gave me creeps.<br /><br />The book is mostly covered with Wallace commentary about drug addiction through myriad eccentric and bizarre characters at the Ennet House. Wallace presents the intake of drugs, its effects and substance withdrawal i.e. cold turkey in such merciless detail that one can't help to actually empathize with those involved in substance abuse.Apart from drugs, there's some wonderful description about depression, clinical depression to be precise. Here's one of my favorite passage which I've tagged as spoiler (view spoiler). At this point one can't help feeling for David's own struggle with depression and the justification of the eventual step he took.<br /><br />With drugs and depression, there are AA meetings and telling of stories, some of which are so despicably ugly and dark that it would make you think that you were better off without reading them.Then of course there is tennis and the pressure this competitive game induces on young minds but also tells how a thin line exists that separates Tennis with real life: Tennis's beauty's infinite roots are self-competitive. You compete with your own limits to transcend the self in imagination and execution. Disappear inside the game: break through limits: transcend: improve: win.<br /><br />At ETA, through characters like Hal and Michael Pemulis, one gets the picture of how youngsters so easily resort to wrong paths, which could adversely affect their coming lives a sample of which could be witnessed through Ennet House residents. So in my opinion it won't be wrong to say that Wallace, in a masterful way presented a connection between past, present and future of different promising lives, which got destroyed because of the few choices wrongly made. At Ennet House, characters like Don Gately convey that despite being wrongdoers, they are good human beings at heart and are just a product of godforsaken circumstances amidst which they were born and at the same house there are people like Randy Lenz who are nothing less than a personification of devil.<br /><br />While reading this book, one gets a fitting impression of David's capability and scope as a writer. There could be nothing more challenging in picking the most undesired and ugly elements of the universe and weave them together and creating characters and situations of such unbelievable contrast that the end product dwelling them makes even a stone heart to wail in sympathy or reach a point of such profound epiphany that brings a huge turn around in your life. He won't present you with anything normal but something lovable nevertheless. What's the most important thing that can happen after reading IJ? The world around you changes for better or for worse. One tends to acquire a whole new point of view of looking at people and can't help thinking, Well, what could be their story?<br /><br />The most incredible example of David's talent can be seen through James O. Incandenza's filmography that is dripping with excruciatingly weird but magnificently witty ideas. I admit that there was not much I could relate with in great depth. My love for tennis and movies (especially Lynchian) wasn't the biggest support system and well, I'm not even American or Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois, so all the more less relief, so my motivation mainly rest with David's writing and the thought of reading a work of literature which is unique in a daunting yet immensely fulfilling manner. It's true that this novel is full of extraneous ramblings but they are not invasive to the main text. If you learn to like his writing, you will love everything written by him, well almost everything. I had my small issues with few things but I'm ready to overlook them. Moreover a clever move by Wallace can be identifiable in the manner of his use of so many `errors' in different context. I know they were mainly attributed to various characters, but again, in a book so huge, the margin of error automatically increases, which could easily be neglect during editing too. So instead of sifting such errors out, Wallace made them the part of his work. If I'll give it a metaphoric angle as a result of some cogitation on my part, then it could also be seen as life, which can't be led without its due share of some big errors. After all that's what being human is all about.<br /><br />One thing I can confidently say about his writing is that in this book, his prose though seemingly reckless at times, is an intentional move on his part. You'll see the range and depth of his skills throughout. Agreed that most of the topics covered had some deep connection with David personal life but that's exactly it makes it all the more brilliant as we get to read someone who had a lucid and precise view of what he had to say. Though I have read that this thing doesn't sit well with many, but that's what reading DFW means. A blogger rightly commented: So many of his critics never realized the writer's relentless and extravagant prose was a deliberate and incredibly risky attempt to present reality as he experienced it, which was so vast and multi-layered as to make sharing it with another person who was experiencing a similar influx, an astonishing feat.<br /><br />Infinite Jest, among many things is homage to sobriety, happiness, loneliness, sadness and truth. For some, staying sober is happiness and for some feeling is happiness. Some will be happy in knowing the truth and some, in telling of the truth.<br />The trick is keeping the truth up-front in daily consciousness.<br /><br />He brilliantly captured the fatuous nature of residents of a country in this era of pop culture in a flamboyant yet amazingly restrained manner that one can't help but feel the pain of the injury the text inflict upon the minds of its readers. It's like watching a reality sit-com over a surveillance camera, is one concise description I particularly like. A work of literature that was born to become immortal and shall teach you what all can be done with words and what power lies within the realm of writing.<br /><br />My reading experience was more or less steady and enriching. Gradually through the main contents, I noticed the book weight shifting from my right hand to the left (though it happened a lot many times considering the endnotes) and reaching the last page and with that last page I realized, there's plenty to come yet. Denouement and IJ doesn't go together in the most conventional sense. There was a lot more left to `figure out'. Before referring to external sources, I wanted to put together as many pieces of this bizarre puzzle at their right places. It was getting unbearable somehow. I was getting afraid what if I would fail or what if after `getting the jest' I won't laugh. And it was then it dawned upon me that every reader of this book becomes a part of it in such a way, that it won't let you fail. `A Failed Entertainment' was the working title for David Foster Wallace's \\"Infinite Jest\\"; and I'm glad he didn't go for that, because I think he produced an entertainment so painfully addictive that It won't be easy to withdraw from it and consequently can't be regarded as a failure. One would carry one thing or the other out of it. There are many loose ends that are not being tied, may be because they are meant to be honored in isolation. The whole thing would turn up as fogged mirror, which only you can clean to see an image, either unbearably beautiful or unbearably ugly. Till that time, live accordingly to the image you want to see at the end. And here's me hoping that one day I'll `get the jest' in toto. I'm so glad that this book exists.(less)k is mostly covered with Wallace commentary about drug addiction through myriad eccentric and bizarre characters at the Ennet House.

If you learn to like his writing, you will love everything written by him, well almost everything. I had my small issues with few things but I'm ready to overlook them. Moreover a clever move by Wallace can be identifiable in the manner of his use of so many `errors' in different context. I know they were mainly attributed to various characters, but again, in a book so huge, the margin of error automatically increases, which could easily be neglect during editing too. So instead of sifting such errors out, Wallace made them the part of his work. If I'll give it a metaphoric angle as a result of some cogitation on my part, then it could also be seen as life, which can't be led without its due share of some big errors. After all that's what being human is all about.<br /><br />One thing I can confidently say about his writing is that in this book, his prose though seemingly reckless at times, is an intentional move on his part. You'll see the range and depth of his skills throughout. Agreed that most of the topics covered had some deep connection with David personal life but that's exactly it makes it all the more brilliant as we get to read someone who had a lucid and precise view of what he had to say. Though I have read that this thing doesn't sit well with many, but that's what reading DFW means. A blogger rightly commented: So many of his critics never realized the writer's relentless and extravagant prose was a deliberate and incredibly risky attempt to present reality as he experienced it, which was so vast and multi-layered as to make sharing it with another person who was experiencing a similar influx, an astonishing feat.<br /><br />Infinite Jest, among many things is homage to sobriety, happiness, loneliness, sadness and truth. For some, staying sober is happiness and for some feeling is happiness. Some will be happy in knowing the truth and some, in telling of the truth.<br />The trick is keeping the truth up-front in daily consciousness.<br /><br />He brilliantly captured the fatuous nature of residents of a country in this era of pop culture in a flamboyant yet amazingly restrained manner that one can't help but feel the pain of the injury the text inflict upon the minds of its readers. It's like watching a reality sit-com over a surveillance camera, is one concise description I particularly like. A work of literature that was born to become immortal and shall teach you what all can be done with words and what power lies within the realm of writing.<br /><br />My reading experience was more or less steady and enriching. Gradually through the main contents, I noticed the book weight shifting from my right hand to the left (though it happened a lot many times considering the endnotes) and reaching the last page and with that last page I realized, there's plenty to come yet. Denouement and IJ doesn't go together in the most conventional sense. There was a lot more left to `figure out'. Before referring to external sources, I wanted to put together as many pieces of this bizarre puzzle at their right places. It was getting unbearable somehow. I was getting afraid what if I would fail or what if after `getting the jest' I won't laugh. And it was then it dawned upon me that every reader of this book becomes a part of it in such a way, that it won't let you fail. `A Failed Entertainment' was the working title for David Foster Wallace's \\"Infinite Jest\\"; and I'm glad he didn't go for that, because I think he produced an entertainment so painfully addictive that It won't be easy to withdraw from it and consequently can't be regarded as a failure. One would carry one thing or the other out of it. There are many loose ends that are not being tied, may be because they are meant to be honored in isolation. The whole thing would turn up as fogged mirror, which only you can clean to see an image, either unbearably beautiful or unbearably ugly. Till that time, live accordingly to the image you want to see at the end. And here's me hoping that one day I'll `get the jest' in toto. I'm so glad that this book exists.(less)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I do recommend this game... If the ads are bugging you too much just turn off WiFi then the ads can't show because they need WiFi!
B008OOYALE|4.0|I like the graphics, pictures, drawings of this product a lot, it shows they must have put enough production time
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I have watched it twice.  Suggest everyone do the same.  I saw things the second time that I missed the first time.  This movie is all about spectacular visuals and symbolism.  A great story with a positive message and awesome acting by the actor playing the teenage Pi.  I have never seen a movie like it.  Very unique!!!
B001TXQN44|5.0|I always liked Buffalo Springfield and revisiting this CD was a great experience. They do not make records like this anymore with just old fashioned playing and singing. Yes I would recommend this CD.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Best show ever made. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Not sure there will ever be another show this good
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|interesting and fun game to have and to play, may get addicted, watch out and limit your time spent on the game
B00CL66FEQ|3.0|Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed.  Very average but I liked the ending.  The melodrama parts were not good and the comedy was so-so.
B009R659L8|5.0|As usual Marry Higgins-Clark does not disappoint! Somehow she manages to come up with thrilling story line after thrilling story line. I loved this book!
B00899F0G8|4.0|same as above<br />when it comes out on june 4th i am planning on buying it from amazon...i saw a few episodes on tv and it looks like this season is gonna be awesome!
B0053FANRC|5.0|I have all the Fast and Furiious Movies so far.  My entire family loves them.  We enjoy action movies. I wil recommend this to all my friends.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This is a good book for people whether they are single or in a relationship.<br /><br />It opens up your mind to ways of thinking which once learned, are so obvious. Yet many people I see (perhaps due to ego and pride or other reasons) go against thinking and acting in this way in relationships and then they wonder why their relationships suffer
B0031RAOVY|5.0|SUCH A SWEET STORY.  I HAVE NEVER CRIED SO MUCH OVER A MOVIE IN MY LIFE.  I AM NOT SURE HOW CHILDREN WOULD GET THROUGH THIS ONE.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It helps you see things in a different view. I couldn't put it down! It was amazing!
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|Good western. Keeps you rooting for the main character the whole way through. I think DiCaprio outshined Foxx on the acting.
B005U9REU0|5.0|I've always loved this movie since I was a child, Jim Henson has always been a great director and this movie proves it.  It is so different compared to his others and that's what counts.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I HAD SEEN THIS MOVIE TWICE BEFORE I BOUGHT IT TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION.  WONDERFUL CAST OF ACTORS AND GREAT STORY...
B005KITK6C|4.0|I was very excited to be able to order my son his birthday gfits through Amazon. I chose this lego kit as well as the Eagle Interceptor. He loved them both. I am extremely busy so it is always nice to know that I can pick my sons favorite item and with a click of a button have it sent quicly to my house. It is a win win for everyone. Thanks Amazon!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I bought this book because my Dad was a B17 pilot.  I thought it would be interesting to more fully understand his experiences as a young man.  However, to my surprise and delight I gained a perspective on the people who fought in WWII that was entirely different than the one I have carried around my whole adult life.  Beyond learning about what it took to be a B17 pilot I discoverd what it felt like to be a German fighter pilot.  This book has enforced my belief in the underlying goodness found in all people, no matter what nationality or under what circumstances.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Absolutely amazing! Passion, heartbreak, murder all in one book! I can't wait for the third book to come out! Must read.
B00866JL96|4.0|I LOVE A GOOD LOVE STORY.  ZAC IS GREAT TO LOOK AT AND NOT A BAD ACTOR.  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ALL ROMANTICS!

B00CL68NOG|3.0|not too involved but cute enough for an afternoon.  i love ms. streisand in everything she has done.  nice movie
B0094K20FK|5.0|In contrast to the first movie, this one still is a classic for me. Ricardo Montallban makes this movie. a young Kirstie Alley is easy on the eyes as well.
B005HSL626|5.0|I'm fruity over this game; it is so much fun.  An instant stress reliever at an unbeatable price, its free.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I don't ordinarily watch a lot of television so I wasn't following Downton Abbey when it aired. After hearing such wonderful reviews about it I started to watch it by syteaming it through Amazon Prime Instant Videos. I am enjoying the show very much and I love the fact that I can stream it for free as I am an Amazon Prime member. It's great to sit down and watch it at my leisure. I highly recommend this series and also Amazon Prime.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very funny; clever and well written. A show that adults and kids will all love.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie!
B009JZTP4Y|1.0|Like so many older movies that I remember liking, it now seems hokey and not well made. The uniforms look like they came out of a bargain bin.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Ben Affleck was amazing in this film. His acting was so subdued, yet he was able to convey every emotion he had. Even though I knew the outcome, my heart pounded during the last 10 minutes of this film. Very deserving of the Best Picture Award.
B009IEXKXI|2.0|Too cumbersome and contrived to be convincing.  Character not very likable.<br />Plot too predictable.  Boring story, could have jumped to the last chapter and been satisfied.
B005VMSATA|3.0|Characters and relationships were highly underdeveloped leaving you with a tenuous connection with the protagonists and very little understanding of the primary antagonist.
B006H5120E|5.0|I love the movie but being in  3D makes it even better the price was great all so again great
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I'm not a total Bond freak; I've seen many of the old films, none of the newer ones. But I thoroughly enjoyed this one. A number of nods to classic Bond movies, great performances by Judy Dench and Albert Finney, and a nice little surprise at the end. Recommended.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Well written and carefully thought out plot.  Character development was excellent.<br />Never felt lost in following plot or personalities. Good book.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Spoilers:  It's only a movie and pretend so I can say this finally; thank God we don't have to put up with her anymore.  Obviously everyone already knows that the Granger kid gets knock off in this one, but what a way to go!  Not only is her death one of the best death scenes of all time, but it is highly regarded as one of the best film scenes ever shot period.  Once the young Miss Granger is in the shower we see Harry Potter approach the bathroom. The shower curtain is ripped open. Hermione screams as Harry, who is yielding a knife stabs her to death, violins, cellos, and violas screeching in the background. As one most well known scenes in cinema history, the shower scene has spawned all sorts of myths and legends. The facts are that they used 77 different camera angles during the 3 minutes and 50 second scene. The combination of close up shots with short durations is a technique explained as, \\"transferring the menace from the screen into the mind of the audience.\\" And transfer the menace they did. The Hermione scene from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 still stands as a bone-chilling example of the ultimate death scene.  To our hero, Harry Potter, job well done!  Mother would be proud.
B000GL1BHO|4.0|My grandson (age 7) loves playing with dinosaurs. He decided we needed one that could fly so we ordered this pteranodon hoping the size would work well with his others, since no size was shown in the description. The size us great, our only issue us the pteranodon's head is turned way over to the side which is weird when you make him fly. My grandson keeps bending it forward but, of course, it won't move.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|A very touching story about a determined owner and the greatest racehorse of all time! A definite must see movie.
B008Y70TMK|5.0|I introduced my 10 year old to the ghostbusters love of my childhood. This was a great experience for the both of us.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|At the competition at the end, isn't someone supposed to get knocked off?  I read the book several years ago and found it entertaining enough, but I thought that was the whole point of the novel; not everyone comes out of the competition alive.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was such a compelling read. I haven't seen the movie yet but I loved the book.  It made me cheer inside for the characters dealing with their issues.
B00C7JAAH0|5.0|Hard to believe people can write such awesome music that one can relate to so closely.  Love everything about this album from the lyrics to the instrumentation.  Cannot say/write enough good things about it!
B004FN1T3A|5.0|For anyone who would like to be generally educated in techniques for natural birth - you will find this book very helpful.  The author was descriptive enough and gave helpful ideas on how to plan and create the right atmosphere for birth.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is not a review of the movie itself (though it was great and thoroughly enjoyable).  This is just a confirmation on what is included with this item:<br /><br />1. Blu-ray disc<br />2. DVD disc<br />3. Digital Copy (gives you a choice for what kind of downloadable file you would like: iTunes, Amazon, etc) [I downloaded the iTunes 720p HD file, which was about 5 GB in size]<br />4. UltraViolet streaming copy (you have to sign up for a UltraViolet account and a Flixster account if you don't already have one)
B00957T6X6|5.0|Thus far the Game of Thrones first book is good and I enjoy every character introduced. Can't wait to finish all of them.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It was an entertaining movie but disturbing to think that humans could be like that. So sad. It makes you think for sure.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|plenty of action<br />character development is superb<br /><br />It has been a long while since I read a Tom Clancy novel  &<br />now I know why------ too many pages
B00B97SNJI|2.0|I bought this album based on the strong review given by David Fricke in Rolling Stone, and my appreciation for what Fricke describes as \\"the precise twang and breezy introspection of Seventies California rock\\".  I guess I got what I paid for.<br /><br />I could hear a little Jackson Browne, a little America, (is that Firefall I hear in music introducing \\"From A Window Seat\\"?) and some other similar sounds from that genre.  I also heard some underwritten lyrics and some overwrought emotions and some really uninspired - though precisely played - music.  I've rarely wanted to hit the \\"skip to next track\\" button on the first listen of an album as often as I did when listening to this one.<br /><br />I'll run through it a few more times - like I always do.  I'll read the lyrics through - like I always do.  In the end, I'm betting that this CD goes back to the store to be traded in, and I have never done that before.<br /><br />Edit...<br /><br />On further listening, there are some points I should mention.<br /><br />Some of the cuts grew on me more than I expected.  \\"Just Beneath The Surface\\" is a decent song, with some interesting lyrics - \\"...Like a feather that finds it's invisible path as it falls\\" - and a not too trite theme of the things we think but choose not to say.  It works musically, though I find the sound mix far too bass heavy on this one (and many others), and the drumming is so pedestrian that it ought to be mixed much further back.<br /><br />\\"From a Window Seat\\" is a fun little ditty about finding something to write a song about. It has brightly played guitar up front (certainly not David Lindley quality, but still OK), but it's still too bass heavy and there's still too much weak drumming.<br /><br />And then we hit the nadir - \\"Just My Luck\\" is pap.  Thin vocalizations of sophomoric lyrics with a whining \\"poor me\\" attitude. Skip this track.  Listen to the next one - \\"Someone Will\\"- once only and then skip it for ever after.  It's a one trick pony ofa song, with one sly lyric to hang it's feed bag from.  \\"Most People\\" opens with a somewhat interesting guitar line but it's such lightweight writing that I can barely stomach it - \\"Most people don't talk about the love in their hearts.\\" Yeah? Well, some people talk way too much about their shallow new agey introspection.  More shallow and whiny introspection follows on \\"Something In Common\\", along with more crappy drumming and little else.<br /><br />\\"Hey Lover\\" was written by someone else, so I won't complain further about the inanity of it's lyrics.  It's another fun little song, and thankfully comes to an end quickly.  I wish the same could be said for \\"Stories Don't End\\".  The lyrics to that one are prescient, \\"...They go on and on, Just someone stops listening, they go on and on...\\"  Quite correct, I stopped listening about a third of the way through.<br /><br />\\"From The Right Angle\\" tries to redeem the album for me.  It is well sung, nicely written, played with enough spirit to be interesting, and mixed properly.  The ending just... ends. Odd bit, that.<br /><br />I skipped \\"Bear Witness\\" as I'm still digesting. It will either grow on me or not.  That is something the last two songs on the album will decidedly not do.  Should you want to hear some really pedestrian drumming - cue up \\"Side Effects\\" and pay attention to the marching band beats as long as you can.  The Reprise of \\"Just Beneath The Surface\\" is a throwaway, in my opinion.<br /><br />And don't forget that's all this review is - my opinion.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Good g am e I liked it .it was sweet .can be a little tofu at first but once y poo u get the hang of t it's on!!!!
B007DA2FHG|5.0|I really liked this movie for the simple reason that even though it cannot be considered real, it is a pleasant departure from what is currently out in main stream movies.  It is a feel good movie.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I loved all the Lord of the Ring movies!  I've read all the books.  The Hobbit is the smallest book and yet they are dragging out the story to make more than one movie.  Amazing and beautiful scenes but I really think they dragged out the battle scenes too much.  If you are a fan you will enjoy the movie for what it is.  My husband had never read the books or seen the other movies.  He said after sitting through this long drawn out thing he wouldn't be interested in the rest of them.  So it really is a matter of taste as in all movies and I am looking forward to the next one.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It is a time-travel book about the Kennedy shooting and I would rather say less or I would perhaps be taking some of the tremendous fun out of the reading experience for the next purchaser.

B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love the game!  But sometimes your game freezes and you don't get your winnings and you lose your bingo credits.  I wrote support and told them this and they sent an email back saying they needed my user ID and receipt number and they would give me my bingo credits back.  I have not heard a word from them after sending this information to them.  I normally haven't had problems with the game but after doing an update it seems to be having some issues with using the power up button (if you use the power up it will cause the game to freeze and you lose everything) and not giving bingo credits when you move up to the next level.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am addicted to it! It is awesome that I can let my creativity flown : )<br />It is worth every penny!
B005DOKL3E|2.0|Too many other case options are significantly better and a case like this is simply impractical.<br />Spend a couple extra bucks and choose something else.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is the best series I have seen in a long time.  I hope PBS does many more series like this.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|A fun game to play and it syncs with your facebook, kindle and phone accounts. Great rewards when you log in each day.

B00820N2JG|3.0|its ok but not as good as famly guy god worse movie ever made dont watch it its  a waste of time
B00COHAUD4|3.0|The characters are very obnoxious and hard to care about, esp. the \\"rocker\\" girlfriend. The scares are mostly the jump type, accompanied by loud bursts of music instead of genuine terror. Another problem is the CGI...it kills any suspense or scares because it just looks fake. I wish the movie business would back off on CGI and use it just to enhance things (if they MUST) because it NEVER looks real (Check out Slither if you want to see a current (ish) film with practical effects (its a blast of a film too, very fun)). Near the end I actually laughed at some of the reveal \\"scares\\". CGI is at its worst trying to make a humanoid. Why, why, why, would a human ghost need to be all CGI? They should have cast an actor for the part, done conventional make up efx, and added CGI for small details. It would have looked real. The CGI ruined the movie for me.<br /><br />Del Toro does not direct this movie and it is no where near the quality of his films. It is almost unfair to the real director to paste Del Toro's name on the film because you immediately expect a very high quality film and are let down. If he had released it without his name on it I probably would have not been so disappointed. If you want to see one of his ghost films, check out The Orphanage, or the Devils Backbone (that one is terrifying and pure Del Toro). They have some genuine scares in them.<br /><br />Mama is adequate but not exceptional. Watch it for free if you can, or rent it if you are desperate/curious, but do not buy it.

1596912863|4.0|All I had to do was to read the back cover and I knew that I, as an age 60+ male, was very much not in the target audience for this book. But (1) having heard good things about the movie and (2) having been a Jane Austen fan for nearly 50 years, I was going to read this book regardless of publisher demographics.<br /><br />The story is about a woman (also) named Jane who is what we can only call a bumbler when it comes to relationships. She is bequeathed a three-week visit to Pembrook Park, the \\"Austenland\\" of the novel. It's a place where wealthy women of disparate ages go to immerse themselves in the Austen era, wearing period clothes, doing period activities, and interacting with a local \\"cast\\" of actors who serve them and even woo them as part of the \\"experience.\\" The women all pretend to be in their twenties and single so as to be seen as marriageable (in terms of period norms).<br /><br />It's an interesting premise which works with mixed success.<br /><br />As a male reader, I wasn't really interested in all the clothing details, although to be fair that aspect wasn't terribly overplayed. Nor was I especially taken in by Jane's various heart-flutters and reactions to the presence of attractive males. Like I said, I'm not in the target audience.<br /><br />Austenland customers are exclusively female. There is nothing there for a male customer, and indeed, male customers would spoil the scripted experience that is provided for the wealthy paying females. But is there nothing in the novel for the male reader?<br /><br />Actually, there's a lot, if you're willing to look for it and set publisher's demographics aside. Author Shannon Hale manages to touch on some important observations about the human condition. Jane Austen did the same, and that made her books timeless and universal. I won't say Ms. Hale reaches Ms. Austen's level. But she does quite well.<br /><br />The plot is relatively lightweight, at least from where I sit. Jane goes back and forth, hope swells, hope is crushed, hope swells again; that much is typical romance fare. What does work is Jane as an evolving character, Jane's development in the way she views herself, her progress toward self-understanding and ultimately, what I can only call redemption.<br /><br />The writing is excellent, and I am delighted that the author didn't attempt a faux-Austen writing style. Modern prose suits this novel well and doesn't at all interfere with the period concepts.<br /><br />My summary is this. The \\"Austenland\\" concept itself is rather mixed and doesn't work completely. The plot is, well, not much. But the writing is good and the lead character is superb. What we learn about ourselves as character Jane learns about herself is what makes this book one to read. Even for age 60+ males.<br /><br />So take that, publisher!ls, hope is crushed, hope swells again; that much is typical romance fare.

B000H4TX9I|5.0|This is a great sci-fi series.  The plot is engaging and the characters appealing (&#34;I am to misbehave&#34; is the ship captain's motto).  I also like the &#34;western&#34; touches to the space theme.  Casting is very strong too: the actors match the character traits perfectly.  Joss Whedon does it again!
193700788X|1.0|Charlaine Harris is dead to me ever after...this book is dreadfully written! Characters are nothing like they've been portrayed for the last 12 books and the ending is ludicrous and irrelevant.  Harris has obviously lost her zest for her stories and ought to retire. Avoid this book like the steaming pile that it is...
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|Well done, always interesting, storyline followed close to that of novel though some variances.  Definitely recommend watching it after reading the novel.
B005ZMTYBY|5.0|A Great Classic my son watched and I purchased for my grandson.  He really enjoyed it.  Would buy again.  A+
B00CL6GAD2|4.0|Riveting, fast paced, and breath taking. Mark Walhberg and Russell Crowe played their roles beautifully. It is a definite must see.
B00CDFWJIG|5.0|I'm a twilight fan but the movies weren't all great, some where better than others. I liked this better than the twilight series!
B004G7UTXG|5.0|A well told, amazing and inspiring, though heartbreaking story.Kept my attention throughout, and left me wanting to know more. A good ending which felt like an ending yet I felt left room for a sequel.

B008QTV3X0|5.0|I was immediately sucked in and watched 6 episodes straight. I compare it to the early seasons of 24. Intense!
B009K86D86|5.0|I thought I knew something about food, sourcing, and agricultural practice.  Of particular surprise was the control the 5 big food companies have on government and the limiting of free speech against practices.

B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Thought this would be about flight and some interesting aerodynamic facts.  It was more about addiction and how it ruins lives.  Had it been billed to be about addiction, then I would have rated it higher, but the listed information was misleading.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|One of my favorite movies, this music is a joy to listen to. It recalls the peace and quiet from many of the scenes in the movie itself.

B00B19GKI0|5.0|You gotta remember:when it was filmed (early 80's) and the budget.<br />Other than that,there are so many good things said I cannot think of more, except \\"METAL GEAR SOLID\\"- an awesome PS1,2,and 3 game that was definitely written about Kurt Russell's character.1st of all they call him Snake-and in mgs2, Iroquis Pliskin. If  ur a fan of video games u will notice.<br />Other than that,Kurt does a well done action hero,and it's a believable act.I first saw Kurt in \\"Elvis\\"-another of John Carpentor's(that was a name Elvis used in \\"Change of Habit\\"-Dr. John Carpentor) and then saw him in this when vcr's 1st came out.Yup, I am an oldie(37).<br />Kurt does all his own stunts,well,mostly, and the movie is a \\"get in,grab him, get out\\" flick.I think it's 1 of the best action  movies of all time.

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this game is outstanding in almost every way (for a phone/tablet app) the only problem I have with the game is the huge amount of time it takes to make your dinosaurs fully grown
B003PVPXOE|5.0|I don't write movie reviews but this movie was just incredible. I was immediately enthralled by the start. The narration was easy to understand and follow. Heck the storyline made sense and it was riveting. The actors and actresses were definitely Oscar caliber. So glad I finally decided to join Amazon Instant Video because no one else had it available.
B001NHNG64|4.0|If you enjoyed the first book, you will like this one as well. This is a fast, fun book to read.
B00000634J|4.0|This collection covers all the songs I wanted to hear, and in that regard its very good. I wasn't interested in purchasing every Lennon song available, just wanted the hits...  However, and this is not specific to this album, the sound quality of these songs just isn't very good. And that quality is the same as on the Lennon 4 CD box set. That's not to say terrible, but this reminds me of many of the first issue CD's, kind of dull and lacking dynamics. Compared to say the re-mastered Abbey Road, the Lennon albums are pretty tired. Take all this for what its worth, but I'm really hoping someone re-masters these works and soon.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This app is awesome really keeps you addicted!!! It relaxes me before I go to bed. Worth trying... love it!!!
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown is a good story-teller.  His book makes you doubt what has generally been accepted as truth since the dawn of history.
B00007KWHN|5.0|Great album, the re-mastering helps freshen things up. However, I think it would be worth the few extra dollars to buy this album in hi-res from HDTracks. This of course depends on what you use to listen, if you're going to rip this to an IPod or play it just as a CD, then I'd go with this format, but if you serve music from your computer to a more serious system then upgrade.
B00AKEMHCA|3.0|Trust me, this is a GREAT game, I've played this on a friend's kindle, but he had extra money on a gift card to buy it, this game is overpriced buy about $1.50. I would totally buy this game,  but it is just not quite worth the price. Three stars are plenty, until the price is changed.
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|It works well on converting text in PDF to speech.<br /><br />Con: It only shows one sentence at a time in the program.
B00004Y6NW|4.0|I had this in an early release, its not definitive, but is a good collection of Dire Straits. Unfortunately, the sound quality was typical of older releases, a little flat. Anyway I liked it enough to pay for the remastered version and its well worth it, a lot more dynamics and depth, this is about as good as any remastering short of buying hi-res.
0857051873|5.0|A very different and quirky thriller with a thought provoking ending.<br /><br />The characters were portrayed convincingly and the plot was intriguing.
B007LGPSX0|4.0|I would give it  5 stars, but was very disappointed when I couldn't get any of the other seasons to watch, can't understand why you would put season 1 out there to watch and not the others. That stinks!!
B00AECGQF2|1.0|bug needs to be fix it wont download u need to fix this problem immediatly its very frustrating really it is
B009NY43NY|1.0|I am so mad I bought this book! I love the Sookie Stackhouse series and i have waited every year for the next book. I feel extremely let down by the final book. i'm mad I spent $12.99 on my kindle for it and what made it even worse is that I felt really disappointed and dissatisfied by the last quarter of the book. If I would have known this book was going to be written so poorly, I would not have bought any other books in the series. The ending was boring and I don't think it was what the readers wanted. Harris was obviously out of ideas and out of touch with her readers if she thought this was a good book before she published it, she should of definitly thought again. It makes me think twice about ever buying another book by Harris.In my opinion this is both the worst and most disappointing book I have EVER read! She screwed up the characters big time. Sookie didn't even really sound like Sookie anymore. Eric is once again a self-serving ahole ( even though he changed in 3rd/4th book) even in the first books he was not this bad. Bill is reduced to such a background character, even though he was so essential to Sookie's evolution. She recycled characters in the book having brought back Quinn, as static noise and Sam's character in the novel is dissatisfying as well. He seems moody and mostly in the background til the last quarter. The only part I thought was even remotely clever is the begiinning of the book.<br />Overall for the longtime  Sookie Stackhouse fans or people who just started reading the, I suggest you NOT buy this book it's absolutely terrible. It will ruin the whole experience for you.

B00BGIC2J2|4.0|A funny movie, an OK plot , good actors.<br />The movie is for a limited  audience who can<br />Relate to the topic. Worth watching.
B004J64QSI|4.0|I am a big fan of Les Mis but already owned the 10th anniversary, the musical movie as well as the complete symphonic recording on CD so I did not need it..  Amazon had this DVD for $7.49 so I could not pass it up.  If you have seen the play and liked it, this is the next best thing.  In comparing the two DVDs, I would say the 10th anniversary has a slightly stronger cast from top to bottom.  Alfie Boe is outstanding and may be as good or better than Colm Wilkinson.  Norm Lewis does a fine job as Javert though not as good as Philip Quast.  Actually, the only weak spot is Nick Jonas as Marius.  He just does not have the voice to do justice to the character.  I found the 10th anniversary production easier to follow for storyline than the 25th, but if you are familiar with the play, you will have no problem.  The video quality of the 25th is superior to the 10th, but it is all about the vocals.  If you were to own only one of them, I would go for the 10th but the 25th is still very good.  I gave it 4 stars because of the Marius part.  He was better than Russell Crowe as Javert in the movie but still the weak link in the production.  Be sure to stick around for the four Valjeans in the finale.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game is interesting as you watch the reef grow, new inhabitants arrive and get &#34;requests&#34; from Nemo and his friends.<br /><br />Just wish it had instructions!!

B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this show, and the BlueRay sparkles.<br /><br />I love all the characters in Downton Abbey, from the sweet Daisy, the lovely Lord & Lady Grantham, the intrepid Bates & Anna, right down to the conniving Thomas & O'Brien. And then, of course, there is the magnificent Dowager Countess (Maggie Smith) who totally cracks me up every time she opens her mouth. Everyone is so human, so real.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Watch it from the first show of the first season all the way through. You won't regret a moment of it. Of course, then you'll be waiting impatiently with the rest of us for Season 4 to be released.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|fun game, truly free. You can buy more stuff, but you'll earn enough as you go along to buy everything you'll need. I really enjoyed all the characters, the game play is fun. just a great free game.

B000056HE9|5.0|David Niven is the Bishop whose desire to build a cathedral as proof of his devotion to God has caused him to ignore his loving wife and daughter. The lovely Loretta Young is the Bishop's wife, who is adored by the people they have served with their ministry in the past. Monte Wooley is an old friend and intellectual sparring partner whose faith journey has always had struggles, and who is feeling as though he's failed at his life's work.<br /><br />Along comes Dudley, an angel sent when the Bishop prays for help. Dudley steps in wherever the Bishop is in TRUE need of help, although seldom in the way the Bishop would wish him to do. Everywhere he goes and everyone he encounters find Dudley's manner to be helpful and caring...except the Bishop who is jealous of all Dudley accomplishes. Dudley charms everyone, including his wife and daughter, and things are getting out of hand.<br /><br />There is a wonderful supporting cast of people you'll recognize including Elsa Lanchester, Mildred Natwick, Gladys Cooper, and the wonderful James Gleason as Sylvester, the taxi driver.<br /><br />We also enjoy the remake of this film called &#34;The Preacher's Wife&#34; with Denzel Washington, Whitney Houston, and Courtney B. Vance, but we always come back to this version. We own and enjoy both, but there's just a little more &#34;story&#34; here.

B0061PEAUY|3.0|Although the book is a page turner, I realize that although I read it only a short time ago I can barely remember the plot. I was interesting to learn about mining for diamonds in fay northern Canada. The ending was unsatisfying, kind of a let down.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Harry Potter movies are always fun.  I devoured the books as they came out.  It's fun to see the filming effects and how things appear to be magical.  The great dining hall has floating candles and decorations change with the wave of a wand. It's also great to see the bad guys and gals get their punishment.
B00881PTRC|3.0|Clever graphics, the first few times you see them,  Word list seems limited.  If you play the same category a few times, you will get repeated words.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|In keeping with the  title of the book  the author takes you  through his incredible journey in a rational, scientific yet very engaging and sensitive manner.You come away believing more than you ever have before ! Atleast that IS what happened to me!<br /><br />Highly recommended for people who have read all available literature on afterlife yet need more proof!<br /><br />This is not a reqd read for firm believers in the afterlife though as it does not reveal anything new in the afterlife experience as compared to the available literature on the subject.<br /><br />Sonal Divekar
1449415881|5.0|I give my husband one of these each Christmas. The cartoons are SO ridiculous but, sadly, so true of much of our corporate world.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie was excellent. The story was captivating and interesting and the acting was phenomenal. I did not know but about the history that this movie was based on, but I did some research afterwards and the movie really seemed to accurately capture and portray the crisis at the time.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|Uninstalled. I could not get my google calendar to import on my Computer. Was very disappointed and have yet to find a calendar I can use with my google calendar on my iPhone. Very frustrating.
0375815260|5.0|the imagination of Roald Dahl is amazing, and kids love the author. good to read silently as well as aloud. my third graders loved it. Please add 5 stars to &#34;Where the Sidewalk Ends&#34;.
B007MJSSCY|4.0|I really enjoyed the story. The actors were all great. But the occasional special effects were a little &#34;cheesy&#34;. As long as you don't go in with high expectations, you will like this movie! It is sad, but also sweet at the same time.
B009K916ZK|5.0|Works flawlessly and is idiot proof. Allows me to run an extra monitor which is great for productivity. I went with this one to get rid of any worries I might have with purchasing a generic brand.
B00BQ1DAHC|4.0|Not as uneven as the last album with its higher highs and lows.  This is a steady on middle of the road effort.  The vibe is good as is the writing.  Does drone on a bit toward tracks 8+.  The first 2-3 are very good.  Not catchy but good.  We shall see if this one gets any radio play like Warrior Song and Counting all the aholes.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|This version of Les Mes was INCREDIBLE. My husband and I have different views about it--he's seen it live on-stage in London, I have not seen it ever before this (I've heard the songs and I know the story, but I've never seen it live on-stage). But the acting and the singing and the emotions in this movie are so RAW and real. It adds such an incredible element to the story. These talented people are actors first and singers second. I love that their voices aren't glamorous and perfect, yet they still capture such intricate elements of their characters. I also love that they filmed the movie &#34;live&#34;--there is SO much emotion in the story!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Such great acting on all their parts. Bradly Cooper was so genuine and lovable at the same time, very convincing. Not used to seeing him in such a role but he nailed it. Jennifer and Bradly are such a good onscreen couple. So many great actors in the movie, they all really bring life to these mental illnesses and how far the human mind can be pushed but still rise above it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|my kids love this game. it is their absolute favorite to play.  the download takes awhile, but they say that it was worth the wait!

B0084BMUFA|5.0|If you loved the Alistair Simm movie version you will love the book. The characters are better flushed out in the book and the story line is a little more involved. A terrific short read for the Christmas season and one of Dickens' best.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I'll keep this short, and sweet.  I really loved this book.  It was a quick read, and I really enjoyed the story line.  The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five, is because I wish the author delved further into Abby's past.  Great read, I also loved the sequel.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|I need to stop reading books so close to watching the movie... The movie was great and the cast was fantastic but the movie took too many liberties from the book... Should have just been titled something else.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Overall, I liked the Hunger Games trilogy.  I found the 3rd book a little more difficult to get through than the first two books in the series.  I would recommend it in order to get closure to the series, but would also warn that this book moved much slower than the first two books.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I love the Walking Dead and love to see the difference between the show and the grafic novel!!!!!!! Only thing missing is Daryl.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it is very fun even at first which isn't always true with most games. The only problem is you have 2wait for the egg and the habitat so it takes a while
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The best game I have seen. The graphics are amazing. It does take up to two minutes to load when first opened and between levels, but it is well worth it. I will definitely be getting everything else from fireproof games.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Brain puzzler, easy to pick up. Love the music and love this game. It is my favorite so far on my kindle.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book shows the beautiful nature of misery. The thing i loved the most about it was probably the fact that even though these people were sad and unhealthy at times, they were never truly miserable. The story of Marius and Cosette is one of the most magnificent things I have ever read and the language itself while hard to read was very much worth it, because it gives the story a feeling of realness and it makes the  story feel true. The characters are well thought out and every one of them was relatable to me, in the end this was probably the most terrific things I have ever read because of the magnanimous Jean Valjean, the innocent Cosette, the free spirited and noble Marius Pontmercy, the revolutionary Enjolras, the woman willing to do anything for her daughter Fantine, the misfits uniting at the L'ABC, the longing Eponine Thenardier, and of course the conniving rst of the Thenardiers. They all create an unforgettable story that will make you long for what they have...
B002AGIEYG|5.0|Brahms: The Symphonies is a 2009 EMI Classics recording under direction of Simon Rattle who leads Berliner Philharmoniker as they play all of Brahm's four symphonies.

B00B69UQJY|5.0|Delta Machine is Depeche Mode's 13th studio album and is a mix of synth-pop and alternative dance. Songs that stand out are Heaven and Soothe My Soul. This is their best release since Exciter and has many tracks that reminds of the feel of their brilliant release Ultra back in 1997. I absolutely loved it! Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
193700788X|3.0|The best thing I can say about this book is that it's not as bad as the last three.  Dead Ever After feels less ghost written than the previous 4 or 5 books.  It feels like Charlaine Harris got back in touch with her characters after a long hiatus.  That's a little weird  and it felt rushed because she's set so many things in motion in the last four or five books.  There was far too much going on here for her to really try to wrap it up in a little bow.<br /><br />Harris has said many many times that she knew from the beginning where Sookie would wind up and that Sookie would never be turned into a vampire.  That didn't really leave much for the readers to hope for, so I'm confused as to why so many readers expected something different than what happened in this book.  It's exactly what she told us it would be.  She gave every character the ending that most suited their core personality.  It seems like every character that Sookie's ever known who isn't dead was featured in this relatively short book. I read it in about 2 hours and have to say that I was about 40% into it before I knew it.<br /><br />I wasn't a fan of the introduction of new supernatural creatures at the END of a series that had barely scratched the surface of the existing ones.  I wasn't really into the \\"Elsewhere in Bon Temps\\" or \\"At a hotel on 1-20\\" parts of the book where she gave us the narrative of other characters. It felt sort of she was acting out a play.  I liked better seeing the world through Sookie's eyes.  This \\"God Mode\\" writing style she employed was not my favorite thing ever, but at the very least, it kept the story moving forward.<br /><br />There weren't very many glaring errors that pushed me out of the book and into the real world again, like \\"catfish hennessey, hennesey, or hunter\\" Or Caroline Bellefleur's 3 layer chocolate cake with the pecan star on top vs Caroline Bellefleur's Chocolate CHEESEcake recipe masquerading as the same timeless prize winning cake.<br /><br />Sadly though, if you read the prologue, the book lays itself out neatly with very few surprises. I knew who the mystery characters were before they were revealed. The context clues were very heavy handed.  There are only a few surprises, but there are a lot of mended fences, cleared slates and just all those things you expect at the end of a series and thankfully, too.  This is THE END. Ms. Harris was kind in that she did not leave us with a mystery, a cliffhanger, or any lingering hope that she has a 14th novel up her sleeve.  I'll be happy to see the \\"What Happened After Dead Ever After\\" book in October, but after that, I sincerely hope Sookie goes on to live her life without us peering through her windows.though, if you read the prologue, the book lays itself out neatly with very few surprises.

193700788X|1.0|Don't waste your time or money on this book.  I've never read fan fiction before in my life but I am certain someone out there has written a better ending for this series and I hope someone will tell me where to look!  This last book makes me regret having bought all the books not only for myself but as a gift for someone else.  I would never recommend this series again.  The ending is contrived and may have made sense as Book 4 but not Book 13.  I would pay good money to read an alternate ending written by someone else.  Don't care who the HEA is but it should make sense and be developed in the plot line.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|As far as movie making goes I suppose it is good. But the last act is so preposterous and none of it (chase scenes, interrigations, phone calls, scramblingfor tickets, etc etc. ) even happened. Zero Dark Thirty...much, much better. SilverLinings Playbook also better. Academy got it wrong again.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Love Adele's voice, enjoy most of her songs.  It seems she likes one style more than others.  I wish she had more in the style of skyfall, and wish that song were on a cd.  Recommend to anyone who loves a good voice.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Easy setup.<br />Voice quality is quite good. Also the battery life (from a single charge) lasts pretty long. Excellent product to have.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|Fun cd, love the beat and how versatile he is.  This is one for enjoying yourself at home or in your car.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Very entertaining, fun characters, slightly predictable but still with some unpredictable twists. Quick read. Will be at a loss when this series comes to a close.
1400049628|4.0|Was a good purchase. Book was shipped early. Only thing was that the box looked like it had been scraped or cut by a knife and the cut transferred onto the book. But it was so small, I didn't care.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|Great information everything you need to get started on the therapy with plenty of tips and information about getting the supplements as well.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|I love this type of Action-SciFi-comedy movie.  Will Smith is always a great actor, this movie is no exception.  Love it.
B00BF11STU|5.0|People would think that this is a guys only type of movie, but as a female, I loved it. The movie was very telling and was good about sticking to the facts. This movie has it all, action, love, sadness and happiness. Have a box of tissues ready, that, and a punching bag.
B00BF11STU|5.0|I loved the hurt locker and this was right up the same alley. Too bad this movie was black listed from oscars
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent book loved the entire series. Kept me on the edge the entire time cried  and cheered through the whole book  I didn't want it to end
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Good movie that had Tarantino all over it. Waltz was also excellent as usual. Seemed like it ran about 30 min longer than it should have but that is Tatantinos style
B0002CVQCW|1.0|its not the company fault, but it wont play on any of my dvd players. im sure the product is good but its forigen
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|This was pretty much schlock all the way thru. Thin story line, bad ending. I think Bradley cooper is trying to set a record for movies made in a 3 year period.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My son wanted the Wii version, but has a habit of getting a game and not playing it. When I found this on Amazon apps I was excited to let him try it out.<br />He loves it, sometimes I cannot get him to put it down. I have even sat and played with him, it is a cute funny game that everyone  will enjoy. Worth what you pay, have not found a downside to this.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Funny movie that was well done. Wife and I laughed along and pointed fingers at each other during many funny scenes. A must watch with spouse!
193700788X|5.0|This is the last of a good series.  I definitely love this book series.  You never know what is going to happen.  This book grabs you from the beginning.  I just received it and started reading it last night.  As soon as I finish, I will give another review.  I hope this will be a great end to a great series of books.<br />May 10th, 2013:I started this book last night and just finished it today.  The book was very hard to put down.  It was sad to see it go, yet happy to see it end as it did.  I was pleased with this book over-all.  It was great.  It had sad parts, happy parts, and parts that leave you wandering.  I loved it.  I do recommend this book.  It is a \\"Good Read\\".
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I wish some items weren't as expensive as they are and that buying money didn't cost so much either. But otherwise I think it's fun and love it!
B00BHMF578|5.0|This movie had me on the edge of my seat most of the time.  The plot was incredibly conceived and played out.  Totally enjoyed every minute of it.  Ben Affleck was excellent as the actor and director.
0307341577|5.0|I read it in two days and three days later had bought the other books written by Gillian Flynn and those were triumphant as well! Love her books, but this one is by far my favorite.
B0065GC0PG|5.0|I'm not much for writing reviews, but I was really impressed with this book series.  Great read. This is a fun vacation book.
B00881PTRC|3.0|Great item for what I need everyday. I would recommend this to my friends and family. Worth every single penny.
B0036UW09U|2.0|I expected way more from a Barbra Streisand movie! The characters were not well developed, and they were kind of unlikable. I wasn't rooting for none of them and I couldn't understand why they fell in love.<br />The ending was too obvious and still, I didn't really care about it.<br /><br />The two stars are for Barbra's great voice and her music (which was great as usual!)<br />I wouldn't recommend the movie to anyone!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Watched this with my wife. Great movie and quite funny too... can't wait for the next one to come out.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|There were many twists and turns and the CGI is amazing! It has a lot of alcohol in somewhat innocent humorous ways so still good to watch with kids.
B009R659L8|4.0|I have ready every book written by Mary Higgins Clark and have loved them all.  Can't wait till the next one.
B00BPWDMP2|1.0|I looked forward to the next release after their third CD, which I absolutely love. To say I am disappointed with Golden would be an unjust understatement. If I can find their address I plan on sending it to them with a request to add emotion and send it back. Flat songs. CD riding on popularity of third release. Sounds more like a commitment to fulfill a contract obligation than anything else.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I loved this book! It kept me on the end of my seat! Definitely will recommend this book to others!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I just love all the characters, and they are so genuinely real that I feel like I am actually watching people live their lives. I also love how such different characters interact with each other. I don't want the story to end!
B008XKSW7M|2.0|I sometimes am a fan of ensemble casts, but this movie tries to cram too much in.  Some do an excellent job with their characters, other are just annoying.  Can check it off my list that I have seen it, but can't truly recommend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my 4 year old downloaded this game because she loves horses and I think I ended up playing it more than she does now!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|MY KIDS LOVE THIS!!  THEY PLAY IT ALL THE TIME AND IT IS MORE FUN TO PLAY ON THE KINDLE THAN MY PHONE!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This was well written and completely hilarious. Be prepared to look like a nut job laughing out loud by yourself. I completely recommend this book.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|My 6 year old has been having fun playing this game.  It has taken him some time to navigate through it but he has been able to do it himself.  I have offered to help but he is not interested in watching me play it.  I like the graphics and the different things you can \\"purchase\\" with your coins when you complete a task.  It is a similar concept to the Littlest Pet Shop App we bought.  My son loves pirates, he loves electronics and completing missions/tasks on them.  Perfect fit for our house!!
B00AAU7AI0|2.0|I am not sure if I got spoilt with some of his other books, but this one just did not Gel with me - it is as if he was just giving a list of good principles through - but the story-telling aspect seems to have fallen away - or it just did not grab me - so I put the book down
B008Y73940|4.0|I read the book and enjoyed how well the movie followed the book. The plot has twists and turns as most Grisham novels do. Great evening entertainment.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Love the drama between the 2 actors and the direction their life is leading them while they themselves are trying to get over the past that haunts them.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|My wife and I went away for the weekend with another couple. They brought season 1 of Downton.  We didn't have any interest in seeing it, It was a snowy weekend so we ended up watching it and got hooked,enjoying it immensely.  We finished season 1 that weekend, and just finished season 2.  Great story and characters. All four of us loved it. Can't wait to see season 3.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Truly an enjoyable series!  So much happens, and can't wait for the next season to start.  Highly Recommend for anyone.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|This story has been told through other movies. This version was presented well and today's technologey added to the visual effects. Personally enjoy these types of flicks.
030758836X|2.0|The first half of this novel was so slow moving I could hardly pick it up as I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen.  Finally in the second half it starts to move and I had a hard time putting it down.  Then THE END.  Right in the middle of the story it just ends.  I thought for a moment that Amazon didn't deliver the entire book to my Kindle and forgot to send the end!  I know I'm a sucker for a happy ending, but at the very least some closure is necessary, even if you plan to write a sequel, trilogy, etc.  At least in my opinion and by my taste, it was hugely disappointing, so much so, that I wouldn't purchase another novel by this author as I don't have the time to waste.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I would kind of rate this more of a 3.5 stars if they had it. It was a pretty good movie. It was definitely better than what I thought it would be.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|A girl and boy marry, live a typical fun life, but when they become unemployed,and move to the boys home town, their personalities change and live becomes mayhem.<br />Crazy people doing crazy things. A slow start, but then the thriller part starts!! A good read
B001QB5S3G|5.0|The Mission seems to be a combination of a number of true and tragic stories of the colonization of America. It pulls at one's heart how the Jesuits expended so much effort to minister to the Indigenous peoples in the Americas while walking a fine line with the powers that be--in this case Portugal and Spain. A definite must-watch!
B002SRQ214|5.0|This is a great, budget product that gives more bang for your buck, I really recommend this for anyone looking for something in the low prices that really delivers great results.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love this game didn't have any problems just don't know how to gt money I play it daily on the train or bus
B001DF68MA|5.0|Gave it a 5 for product quality and price. Best for the price, could use more padding for my baby's bum, seat cushion that comes with it is not enough.  Overall a great product!
B006Z9SP3E|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book but it was certainly not as good as the first novel in this series. I am a Jeffery Archer fan and have read most of his novels. This one is good but I would not rate it as one of his best. I would recommend the book and think that it is a very pleasant easy to read book.
193700788X|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a true blue fan of this series. I started this book way before True Blood.  I can't imagine watching True Blood first and then reading the series.  I stopped watching True Blood after season 3 because I thought if drifted too far from the heart and soul of the books.<br /><br />In the 13 books I can honestly tell you I LOVE Charlaine's storytelling style. I am always sucked right in. I love the down to earth feel in a crazy supernatural world.<br />Some books I loved more than others (4 was my favorite)<br /><br /> It was a roller coaster from start to finish in every book.  I believe this last book was true and authentic to the Sookie we have come to grow and love.<br /><br />This was not Twilight...I never believed Sookie wanted to become a vampire. Even though Eric was my dream Vampire, I never thought that is who she should end up with. I felt like Sam was HOME to Sookie and it was the perfect ending. When I picture her future it will always be in her Grandma's house in a lounge chair in the sunshine with Sam. I loved it. Thank you Charlaine for staying true to the roots of this series.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|What is better than a run with Lindsey Stirling on the playlist? Not a whole lot. If you like Celtic influenced music, you'll like this.
B00AS1Q8FW|2.0|I have just finished the novel, One Shot, that the Jack Reacher movie is based on. Very loosely. I rented the movie from Red Box after reading the book. The Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child don't work very well on the big screen, was my first conclusion. This is, in part due to Tom Cruise casting himself as Jack Reacher. Now, if you enjoy Tom Cruise playing Tom Cruise, you will probably be satisfied with the movie.<br /><br />I have read nearly all of the Lee Child novels featuring Jack Reacher. Reacher is an iconic protagonist. He is meticulously described early on in every novel as 6 foot 5 inches tall and around 250 lbs, blue eyes and sandy hair. He owns a toothbrush and that's about it. No car, no driver's license, no driving skills. A somewhat clumsy individual except when he is involved in hand to hand combat. He drifts around the country until he is caught up in some Knight Errant quest, whereupon he metes out his own brand of justice, which is always brutal.<br /><br />No effort was made in the movie to pass off Cruise as the Reacher character in all his towering physical persona. O.K. I get that, but also missing from Cruises character is the steel trap calculating thought processes that Reacher exhibits as he tracks down the antagonists in the novels. That may have been beyond the capability of the screen writer and Cruise.<br /><br />Some notes about the movie compared to the book. There is NO muscle car chase in the book, in fact there is no car chase at all in One Shot the novel that the movie is supposed to be based on. The Rosamund Pike character in the movie is not abducted in the book. There is no shoot out in a rainstorm at the end of the book as depicted in the movie. In fact, there is no shootout at all at the ending. And, the main antagonists do not meet the end that they do in the movie.<br /><br />I was left wondering why they bothered to call the movie Jack Reacher or to mention that it was an adaptation of the novel, One Shot. They might just as easily called it Charlie Schwartz. No one would have known the difference.<br /><br />I think the short cameo in the movie featuring Lee Child said it all. A shrug! The cameo showed Child seated in a police uniform. Good thing he wasn't standing. Lee Child (a pseudonym for the author Jim Grant) is 6 foot 5 inches and around 250 lbs. He would have towered over Tom Cruise. We can't have that in the movie, can we?<br /><br />I sincerely hope they don't attempt to bring any more of these Reacher novels to the screen. At least not without someone believable in the part.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Sure, Tom Cruise isnt the physical embodiment of Jack Reacher from the novels, but I would rather have a great actor than a WWE Superstar in the title role. Seriously, you want Tom Cruise or Edge? Hugh Jackman is probably the only one I would have liked in the role more the Cruise.<br /><br />For the movie, I liked how everything was pieced together. Its fun watching Jack Reacher work, cause he is not your normal investigator. He just does things his way without a care in the world. This is a good investigation movie with excellent action sequences in-between. Reminded me of a mix between Bullitt and Get Carter (1971).
B00ARI9CDQ|3.0|its okay not my cup of tea is all.  To use to my my old ays with regular email.  thank you
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This is like bejeweled blitz that I play on facebook. I like it though you only get 5 lives at a time.
B00124LYHQ|5.0|What can you really say that hasn't already been said?  It's Marlon Brando. It's Tennessee Williams. They did it right.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|There are several modes to unlock, and the game is fun.  Very simple to learn and there are no issues with the controls
B0052AC8C6|3.0|The good: character designs, visuals, fun references<br />The bad: weak writing, cheap shots, tries to accomplish too much in too little time.<br /><br />Side note: a bit philosophical.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I liked how the story described his background and training.  I wish that he would have been able to go into more detail about the weapons of mass destruction and the assignments he was involved in.  I understand that those situations are probably secret.  An easy read.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|If you love call of duty or battlefield you will love this game buy now it's on sale when I bought it was 6.99 it has a great storyline and graphics
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This is the most intense drama series I recall. Fast pace and hard driving action!!!  I have seem the series and I'm watching again.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|The final movie, the final book, so sad that this series has ended. JK Rowling showed us that the little lessons of life,perserverence, love and acceptance of others will endure. It is not easy to lead and you might lose some cherished things on the way but if you keep true to your heart you will endure. Harry Potter and his freinds are a wonderful story and the adventure was fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game. My kids absolutely love it and play it for hours on end! (On weekends only, though!:-D)
B000VK99Z6|4.0|The hilarious and versatile duo are back, after I fell in love with them in Shaun of the Dead.  This movie took a few watches for me to get in to (possibly because I have to turn on the subtitles to really catch all the british-isms), but the more I've seen it the more I've come to love it.  And Timothy Dalton is deliciously evil.
B00BHU261S|3.0|Glad I rented the movie as opposed to paying regular theater prices. Interesting insight to the importance of  Hitchcock's wife during his career.
B005NPBT5M|5.0|Nothing like taking a trip down memory lane.  I had this album many, many years ago and was quite excited to get it again.  Thanks for the memories.
B00BLGZDVS|4.0|L. Ron Hubbard was quite the con man.  A very interesting story about the man who &#34;discovered&#34; Scientology.  Worth renting.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey has done some great fun work here.  I ended up giving it to a friend who teaches dance to inner city kids and now they love it too!
B00BESNKB8|4.0|I love these movies.  The cinematography is always first rate and the nonstop action sequences are always entertaining.  Worth the rental.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It is different from the Friends Angry Birds but it is fun as well.  I only have it on my Kindle and haven't figured out how to get it on my computer yet but I like it except for the ones with the monkey's or whatever those things are.  I hate monkeys.
B00CHILW64|5.0|The entire cast was outstanding, conveying a true sense of determination to survive and to find one another.  The tsunami staging captured what must have actually occurred during the actual horrific event.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|My son and I love this movie.  You're not right because you're older, you're right when you are right. And, it makes him get excited about the library.  Just awesome
B0029LCJJS|4.0|I'm always sad to see characters go, but with a bit of history, I knew what was coming and for whom. The dark humor about execution on the part of the characters is refreshing to see.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Girlfri<br />best by free diary Dr Dr down for your YouTube google I Haden just fo google beyonce google for day
B008OHV5C8|5.0|I found Made Possible to be a little mellower than their previous effort, but I really liked it nonetheless. I love progressive jazz, and especially bands like The Bad Plus who take jazz in new and unexpected directions.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I love playing this game. Your battle includes heroes, soldiers, and neutral creatures.  You destroy those as well as defense towers, barracks, and endgame base.<br />Pros:<br />  Good graphics<br />  Hero selection (if you don't like free characters, wait a week)<br />  If you have favorite hero you can save up money (game money or real)<br />  Solo option to test hero after adding/changing talents<br />  If you are new, play co-op to build yourself before trying PvP<br />These aren't really cons, but did deserve mention.<br />Cons:<br /> Surrender option is too easy; needs confirm after vote yes (I hit it by accident)<br />  Tutorial could be more in depth<br />  Can't search other players' stats, just has top 20 or ones near you<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone who considers this game, and remember this is an in-depth game that doesn't make you pay after playing a few times.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This and Walking Disaster were both great.. I was hooked from the beginning to the end, I read both books in less than a week. I have a very busy schedule but I made time because I couldn't put them down..
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like it but I think we should be able to buy whatever whenever we want too!! Also I wish we got more money and space
B009RI4FRU|5.0|WHAT A RIDE!!! Had to pause and repeat so many times because I was laughing<br />So hard and did not want to miss another line!
B0052AC8C6|5.0|This movie is one of a kind in all animation films. Gripping story line, fantastic visual, humorous and philosophical. The artistic quality is legendary.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I loved this game so much that I bought the full version just to get more levels! I wish that I could buy more! I have beat all of the levels to the nine by nine (still working on the tens!) I keep resetting progress and starting over! It is that great of a game. My 12 year likes it, my 16 year old likes it, even my mom bought it! It is well worth it!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|After I played &#34;The Room&#34; and really really liked that game, I looked for a similar game. Azada was recommended. Azada was not as good as &#34;The Room&#34; but I did enjoy playing it. Azada has several varieties of puzzles, some I found harder than others. It has a time limit for each series of puzzles and a few times I'd have to repeat the puzzle series to complete within them within the time limit. And sometimes on the hidden object games I'd have to click help. Some of the touch sensitivity is partly to blame for that as I would try something and it wouldn't work, but then help would tell me to do exactly what I had just been trying to do. URRGH! I did finish this game and liked it well enough that I bought the Azada sequel... which is not as good.
B009RH9FR6|1.0|This did not fit my 7&#34; Kindle at all...but haven't had time to ship it back.  Can I still return it?
B003VANOFY|5.0|Does everything I need it to do and so much more from voice changers to setting my audio settings its simply amazing.
B005LJITS0|3.0|Like so many movies nowadays, Green Lantern depends heavily on spectacular special effects to prop up the story line and the acting. It was average comic book fare. Without the effects, I'd probably give it 2 stars.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Great movie. Acting & story were fabulous!!!<br />I would recommend it to anyone who likes good movies. A great watch.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Only 4 stars this season because I am still getting used to Deb knowing Dexter secret.  Still love the show.
B009OYTAL8|4.0|Great! I really like the show. More Felicity please!! Get that girl her own show. Lots of fun good job
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I work at a retail store and they've been playing a trailer for this movie for the past month.  I like Seth and I like Babs so I rented it.  It's a pretty formulaic screenplay and you could predict pretty much most of the story line.  Barbra is great as the overbearing Jewish mother and I thought that Seth's Andy role could have been written with a little more backbone to him but all in all I enjoyed the movie.  I would say that Streisand fan will like this but it's not Seth Rogen's best.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love this show.  It is one of the best lawyer shows on TV.  It is a must to watch.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|it is awful that Amazon is the only place that has this to view, I have subscribed to both Netflix and Hulu but they don't have third season.  But this show is so worth to pay for it that its ok. Next season now please!!!
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I would have given 5 stars if it did  not stops the game when you are almost finishing. the and you.have. to.start again or they tried yo sell you another game<br />But that said. is. lots of fun.
B009A9BF5G|5.0|If you are a Coldplay avid fan, this is a must, great music and thrilling on blue ray of course
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Good flick!  Jodie Foster makes for an interesting scientist.  She seems more the part than Tom Skerrit.  I will more than likely watch this flick again.
B004YXE438|5.0|If you enjoy doing puzzles, then you will enjoy this app.  The puzzles can be as easy or as challenging as you choose.  The photos used for the puzzles are colorful and interesting and some (like close-ups of coffee beans or nuts) add a different dimension of difficulty.  The app itself is well designed and organized.  The price is excellent, especially considering what you get... hours and hours of entertainment!
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|It's a very fun game. Easy to play. I enjoy playing when I have a few minutes to kill. The grandkids like playing it also and it is something we can play together.
B009POCG0Y|1.0|Boy!  Talk about a &#34;NEVER AGAIN!&#34; movie.  I'm sorry I bought this piece of junk.  I've never before slammed a movie as I have this one.  I will note the screen writer of this depressing movie, and avoid them and the director on the future.  The actors all played their parts to perfection but that was not enough to save this bit of &#34;Hollywood's Worst&#34;.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle was a true American warrior.  He gives praise to his fellow warriors, but didn't hold his tongue when discussing those not pulling their weight.<br />  All of our American warriors sacrific so much so that we can enjoy our freedom.<br />  R.I.P. Chris
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love this game  but wish I could more ahead/ I need a 60 minute bonus all the time! Now that I am doing them all  to advance I have to buy it BUT it's free!
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Love this movie for all the what &#34;ifs&#34; it contains and the different way it presents our &#34;contact&#34;. Gotta watch it every time I find on t.v. :)
B0064X7FVE|4.0|quick & accurate - widget works as it should & keeps me updated.  Live in severe storm area & the alerts are usually the first notification I get.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I feared the book would get boring since it is just one woman walking on a trail, but the story is told in such a way that keeps you interested. Cheryl is very honest in her descriptions about her childhood, mother's death, marriage & divorce, and personal struggles. While I found it mostly believable, it was tough to &#34;like her&#34; all the time. Sometimes I wanted to shake her and tell her to pull herself together!
B004UHL9EK|4.0|Got this after paying for several other timers. This one works as expected.  It doesn't get &quot;locked up&quot; if you are doing something else when it goes off.  You can cancel it or reset it when it goes off. Nice feature.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Reading the book felt like having a conversation with a close friend. Tina Fey is very honest and comical with her descriptions of growing up and having a career and family. I never watched 30 Rock, but after reading the book I started and am constantly impressed. I decided to get the book for my mom as a Mother's Day present. She will probably enjoy it even more since there are a lot of references that I had to look up!
B001NA6096|3.0|If I was twenty years younger, I might have liked it more... It redeemed itself toward the end and the sequel, I think, makes watching this movie more more worthwhile.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Love this movie.  Will watch it over and over.  Will also purchase it at some point.  You won't be disappointed.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|After watching the first film, I wanted to see how Linklater and the two actors had followed it up. This film feels much more real somehow.
B0026QC0YU|3.0|DEscent movie.  Probably wouldn't watch it again anytime soon...but I do want to see the other &#34;Mission Impossible&#34;s in the series.
B0020TS5JM|5.0|This is the full length version of this film.  It is much better than the chopped version we saw in the USA.  Great video, great audio, and an awesome movie.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|This movie is worth the effort. Ignore the horrible stallone version this isn't the same.  Enjoy all the slow motion shots.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I liked this book because of the content (seems prettyclose to current reality) and kept me thinking about it long after each read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie and didn't see why all the hype. so I decided to read the book. It was a very good read - I didn't want to put it down. The movie tracks the book well but the book is much better. I immediately started the rest of the series.
193700788X|1.0|I wasnt expecting great because the series has been going downhill for me the past three books. But I was not expecting horrible writing and the blasé ending! It really seems like she Just didn't care how it ended! I will not purchase anymore books from this author ever again!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this movie!!! I watched Season 3 on TV and I cant wait for Season 4!!!<br />I would highly recommend  this movie.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent read!  Well-written, would hghly recommend it!  I didn't see the ending coming at all, it totally held my interest!
B00AMHFMIG|5.0|Love it! I absolutely love this show! I could watch it over and over! Very happy with how cheap it was to
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Contact is Just amazing gripping Film of its time. I had never seen this Movie and My Daughter called me up and told me I had to see it .. and I agreed after watching it I wanted to see more it just was a move before its time ... Alien being Heavenly beings .. It really Makes One see How little we really are on this Plant earth.. inspiring movie she follows her dreams , being a women in a mans world you see how We are treated differently , and you see a Women who though humility .. stands her ground and her destiny is full filled I just really couldn't find anything I dislike about the movie and I too would tell others to watch and see the great our Universe is.... We are not alone in this great Movie .
B0061C1NQ6|5.0|I had read Gorky Park twenty years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it, but the true genius was more apparent to me this time.  Cruz Smith evokes Moscow in a way that i just stunningly compelling.  Arkady Renko is one of a kind -- and his gradual evolution from an investigator whose only goal is to get Pribluda and the KGB to take over the investigation -- to one truly seeking justice -- is a ride like no other.  I highly recommend this book, not just to crime fiction enthusiasts, but to anyone who loves great characters.
193700788X|2.0|I read that book! I am not going off spoilers or anything. I just finished reading it.<br />I think this book is not one of Harris's best work. The story was slow to start, it made no sense through out the story, there were parts that dragged because it was just normal everyday stuff, there really wasn't a climax at all to anything, there was no closure with any of the characters, and the ending was simple that- an ending. I am not a Sookie/Eric fan so the ending had nothing to do with how I felt about the book. I am very disappointed in this book. Harris could have done so much more and she didn't. To bring her readers from book 1 to this crap in book 13 is disgraceful. I am so disappointed. I don't know how many more times I can write that. Very Disappointed!
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Although this was utterly depressing, I felt like it was an intimate way to see how the Taliban came to power. This book is so real and so heartbreaking.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|What can you say. this is a oldie but a goody (.Oh by the way witch one is Pink). LOL
B0058PJ6NE|2.0|I cannot see any difference from the free version.  It is not very intuitive like the iOS or computer web browser version.  I have given by iPhone to a 3-year old and they can use the You Tube app on the iPhone.  I have a Masters in Computer Science and have a hard time the the Kindle verson
B004KPQK2S|5.0|I found this to be a very exciting, uplifting movie, and all the more since it is a true story!
0439023521|5.0|Wow, the premise of this book is genius, but also disturbing on many levels. Several of my 4th grade students have read this book but they don't understand why the book's themes are so shocking to me-maybe they lack historical context or maybe they're just so used to seeing violence on TV and in video games.<br /><br />*I see analogies to Hitler's Germany with the use of hunger and food to control the districts (who are essentially prisoners of war). Katniss notes that there are not many old people in her district and many starve to death. Of course, they can always get food and cooking supplies but at the extreme cost of putting their name in the games lottery.<br /><br />*The contrast between the government and the district people is stark and scary. The gov't. population have all the luxuries that one can think of but have absolutely no social conscience about making kids fight to the death in front of them. It brings to mind the Christians thrown in the Roman colosseums to fight lions for the entertainment of the populace.<br /><br />*The fact that Katniss has to stand naked in front of the male and female stylists (remember, she's only 16) to be inspected adds more horror to the people who run the games. The author doesn't portray this as a sexual act, but merely as how a farmer would inspect a cow or pig that he intends to buy and butcher. However, Katniss also notes that several tributes have been brought out for their TV introduction nude or semi-nude (Katniss hopes that her stylists don't do this to her).<br /><br />*I can't think of any other book I've read where kids (aged 12-18) have to fight and kill each other. I suppose we're used to reading about adults fighting and killing but not children!<br /><br />*Unfortunately, I saw the movie before I read the book. There's so much information in the book that's not in the movie, like how Katniss got her name and how she got the mockingjay badge (and its significance). I will read the other two books in the series before seeing the movies. I can't wait to see the gov't. get its due at the hand of the districts (at least this is what I suspect will happen).<br /><br />I highly recommend this book but probably not for kids less than 16 years old. And I would suggest discussing it afterwards.<br /><br />I wouldn't take a star away but I will say that it's strange to read a book like this written in the present tense. I can't remember the last time I read a novel not written in past tense...eries before seeing the movies.

B006DGHYJK|1.0|Never viewed movie due to incompatability of Blu-Ray player.  Received the movie from Switzerland, and it cost more to send it back then buy the movie.  I should have thrown it out!  Very disappointed in my haste in purchasing this movie.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I have not read the book; my son says it's excellent and the movie honors the book very well. The use of CGI is excellent if sometimes still not perfect. The narrating character of Pi is particularly effective as is the man interviewing him.
1878424114|5.0|I found this book very illuminating and have shared it with a number of people.  I very much appreciate and enjoy Dr. Deepak's world view, his way of being in the world, and I find his lessons both thought provoking and inspirational.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|The author explores genetic engineering in a novel and fascinating way and explores humanity's introduction as a space faring species focusing on both its moral merits and failures. I don't want to spoil anything.<br /><br />One of my exceedingly small criticisms is that most extra terrestrial species are essentially human in different shapes as opposed to Niven, Pournelle and company that imagine truly alien Aliens. But this does not subtract from the enjoyment.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Captivating. Everytime I thought I knew what was coming next, it took a complete turn. One of the best books I have EVER read!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game is very addicting. I play it every day and it is very hard to turn it off once you start playing. I love it, wish their were more games like it.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I'm no expert At knives, but I do know how to select a good knife. When I saw this knife I didn't think it would be a good knife, but as soon as I saw some reviews on  the Schrade Extreme SCHF9 I got it right away. The shipping took a few days but once I got the box. I took it out strapped the sheath to my leg and went out and started chopping wood. I gave this knife five out of five because of the comfortable kraton handle, nice grip on the handle, and the finger holds. Now lets get off of the handle. The Blade is high carbon steel with full tank construction, witch means that blade goes through the whole knife, and this blade is very very strong. while I was cutting wood I accidently smashed the blade on the ground and it is still as sharp as when it came in the box. The final detail I want to talk about is the sheath. The sheath is nylon with a plastic casing inside the nylon, it has a detachable pocket in the front that can fit quite a lot in it, I can fit a flint and steel set, a box of matches, a roll a tinder, a multi tool, and a small flash light. From what  I've told you thats all you need to know  about the knife, and I garenty  you  that  you will love this knife.

B00BF11STU|1.0|To many dark screens. No plot. I would have liked to have seen more how the Seals trained for the mission.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|I am a big stone sour fan and this cd is all I expected it would be. I would reccomend this to all stone sour fans.

193700788X|1.0|I finished reading this book 2 days ago and I wanted to sit on it for a couple of days before I wrote a review. Honestly, this is the first time I have ever reviewed anything on Amazon, but this book compelled me to write one.<br /><br />All of the 1 star reviews have posted a lot about the things I am going to say in much more detail, so I am going to keep it as short and sweet as I can.<br /><br />I had been anticipating this book for a year, granted the last few books haven't been great, but I wanted to know the conclusion to all the characters I have grown to know and love over the years. I waited patently, I actually hadn't heard the spoilers because of midterms and a bunch of job interviews, so I came into the book objectively.... and I wish I had known the spoilers before I wasted my time. I read the book cover to cover in one sitting, in which I wondered what happened to Ms. Harris? Why would she make this book so rushed? Why did she make characters who we all know into people we didn't recognize, or even like? Why would she spend years and books building up a romance that she ends in the most out of character way possible, then force readers into another one that was never really established in the first place, with no warning? The \\"mystery element\\" was pretty easy to figure out, and the \\"surprise twist\\" in it was unsatisfying. For someone who claims these are based more around the mystery than the romance, she failed at that as well. I have never been so unsatisfied with a book in a long time. There are books where I have been like, \\"Mehhh, it wasn't great, but I'll live\\" and I guess eventually I will feel this way about this book as well, but I can say I have invested more time and money into this series than the others that I have felt that way about. So that could be why my opinion is so biased but I can tell by reading these reviews, a lot of people feel that way. I would say if you need to read this book, just for completion of the series, please borrow it from a friend, or go to your local library. Don't waste your money.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|This cd was pretty great, there were some of the interludes that could have been taken out but overall the music was great!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|These books are very engaging and encourage my kids to read for hours. Very funny passages, well written and easy to read.
B00886XQO0|4.0|I've had the X41 for maybe 15 months and they were great.  I got a crackle or pop here and there every few weeks.  I've added a bunch of stuff on my wifi over the last month and when my Wife and Kids were all home and running their ipods and ipads and laptops and everything else.... they became unusable.  Loud pops every 2 min or so.  They were fine late at night, but couldn't stand the interference anymore.  Also, the changing of rechargeable batteries became a pain when they would just die mid multiplayer game and I'd have to scramble to get them swapped out.<br /><br />I went with the Tangos for a few reasons.... I knew the dual band would solve my interference issues and the headset has a built in battery with a long usb cable and gives alerts the battery is low and doesn't just shut down.  The best reason is that in my research for a new headset I found them for in-store pickup at BB for $130.99.  They showed out of stock everywhere but I'm in a rural area and figured might as well just run out to see if they have them unknowingly.  Sure enough they had a lone set on the shelf and went to the C/S desk to get them for the price on their site advertised for in-store pickup only.  They also sound better than the X41 did.  There is a more sense of direction from right to left and front to back.  So much so that I did have one problem.... I was playing BL2 and the surround got flipped somehow.  Left was right, and front was rear.  It was completely disorienting and unplayable.  I Kept turning around looking for guys when it was just the action in front of me.... very very odd feeling playing this way.  I had to reset them and went back to working as they should.  Couldn't be happier with them.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Colors and patterns on tiles are difficult to tell apart.  Would be better if colors were bold instead of muted.
B0079J28NW|5.0|The order arrived right on time and everything was in order. The Blu Ray version is really well done and the extra features are a pleasant addition!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the Solitaire by MobilityWare.  It's fast and fun, a great way to pass some time when waiting for someone or something.
B00821PCJS|5.0|It is one of the few sci fi series that kept my interest episode to episode. Really good stuff. Kept me guessing as to which human was going to be infected with a virus and controlled by the creatures.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I don't think this latest book is that bad.  The ending felt kinda rushed, but overall I enjoyed the book.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Gripping description of the bombing and aftermath of Dresden.  I will read it again, and encourage others to as well.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|I finally have found a way to lose weight in a healthy way and not go hungry.. Tried Adkins, calorie counting, and just not eating enough.  None of them worked. Been on this about 3 weeks and lost  about 7 pounds.  Really feel better too.  I recommend this book based on my results.
B009ZQ7M1U|3.0|Pretty good story line, although it bordered on a unacceptable relationship it never crossed the line. As it came to an ending the struggles revealed themselves. I would definitely recommend it, and will definitely watch it again
B007HC3LHS|1.0|I kept waiting for it to get better but it didn't.  I told my daughters not to read it because it was so depressing.  I HATE wimpy women and she was ridiculous.  What a waste of time.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Intriguing plot, intelligent writing, stupendous acting. Tatiana Maslany is a gem! Cannot wait to see each new episode. High;y recommend!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Les Miserables is a remarkable musical.  Dramatic, beautiful cinematography, romantic, and inspiring.  Awe inspiring story and theatrically magnificent!  Rent it now!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was just as good at the first in this series.  I couldn't put it down!  I highly recommend it.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|When I began watching it because it was recommended to me did'nt think I would like it but after 3 episodes I watch all the seasons that were offered on Prime and then bought the 5th season. Can't wait for the 6th season now great action and drama  love it
B000HF6XV8|5.0|This movie is a time less classic.....The Secret Garden teaches everyone valuable lessons about life, forgiveness & hope...a great movie to watch with children & family.....buy it!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My husband, 6 year old son, and 4 year old son all play this game. My 3 year old hasn't quite got the hang of it. But it's definitely fun for all ages. I actually wish that I hadn't downloaded it. I never have access to my kindle because this game.
B0096HIEE2|5.0|I saw it in the theater and had to see it again! My bestie had not seen it and she loved it too.
B004AP9W46|5.0|I have been a fan of Anne Rice for many years! All her books are so addicting and have the power to reel you in. I absolutely love it.
B0094K1JPC|3.0|Cute, entertaining and the lead man love interest is of course a total fox.  Good for just no brainer watching.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Good Bond movie. Better than Casino Royal. If your an old or new Bond film fan, this is one to see!
B0050SYS5A|2.0|It distorts the view a lot and seems to be smaller than the camera's sensor, meaning you get dark corners.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love the game but I have a kindle fire I had to restart two times that's crazy but love it
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Was sent out in a timely fashion. The movies came in a nice 8 DVD package. Not a blemish on any of the discs. Kids loved the movies.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I can honestly say after reading the book a second time I have come to love each character. Christian's back story just makes fall for him even more so than in the first book. The development of the story line makes for a fantastic read. I have and will continue to suggest this as a great read for the many years to come. Keep them coming E L James!!!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|It was so much fun reading this book, being a huge fan of the show. It feels like a big Castle episode. And page 105 is hot!
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|Would like a detailed how to play but my seven year old figured it out after working with it a while
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This movie has more spoken dialoge than any other movie I watched lately.  It was a nice change, but the ballroom dancing bit was cheesy.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This book was a nice surprise.  The main character had just enough depth to be believable.  I was rooting for the &#34;super-hero&#34; from start to finish.
B000GT6JS2|5.0|Very bizarre but a wonderful movie one of my new favorites!!! If you love the labyrinth you'll love this movie :)
B001JIES4Q|5.0|This movie has everything. The comedy is classic and timeless and the touching moments are heartfelt. It has something for everyone.
B00CJ7EK4E|5.0|Rod is a true rocker! He proves Rod can write with the best of them. Clean, true and pure rock music.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I have read this series twice now and find it enthralling and well written. There is a depth to the world that is seldom seen in other fiction and it binds the story in a way that makes it seem visceral. Not an easy read in truth but well worth the effort. Adult themes abound and yes, its raunchy in parts, grotesquely bloody and violent in others. I love it
B007EECSFA|5.0|I loved this book and have recommended it to friends.  There is a depth of plot that I enjoyed immensely.  I loved the way the author sent us from the present back to WWII relating details that would uncover the mystery of Dorothy's youth.  I found the air raids during the London blitz fascinating and frightening.  There are twists and turns in the story that are riveting.  The conclusion is a complete but credible surprise.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book. It was so good. The action, the plot, the drama so come good together to make such a good book.
0307744434|5.0|I was immediately drawn into this story.  It was a mystery but completely different from anything else I have read.  The battle between the illusionists seems completely credible even though it is about magic and ilusion.  The description and details of the circus and its characters are amazingly vivid.  I wanted to seek out this mysterious circus and go there. The timelines in the book are fascinating, also.  Pay close attention to those timelines. I must say that I enjoyed this book, in case you couldn't tell,  and have had discussions with friends who have also read it.  I cant wait for Ms. Morgenstern's next offering.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Although some parts were difficult to watch, I expected that because of the nature of the story.  It was very touching and had a message of hope.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|After reading The Aviator's Wife, I followed it with Those Angry Days.  It gave a great deal of information on Lindbergh and his fall from grace along with his redemption in the public eye.  It gave perspective on how difficult times those were with the isolationist, anti-semitism, and interventionists viewpoints.  I didn't realize how much FDR relied on The Gallup Polls to help shape his own policy.  It also helped me understand why J. Edgar Hoover had so much power and how paranoid a country's leadership can become during high times of stress.  This book helped fill in the banks after reading In the Garden of Beasts:  Love, Terror and an American Family in  Hitler's Berlin and understanding why it took so long for the United States to enter WWll.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Well done, well-acted and at times riveting. I had planned to watch about an hour and finish up the next night, but could not stop it. One interesting and perhaps odd phenomenon is that it was also suspenseful enough to want to see how it ended.
B002ZBN13A|5.0|I just wish there was more music like this. Haunting female vocals,  rich guitar and piano,  the occasional duet.  The music feels mature without being vulgar
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I purchased the Anker Gaming mouse looking for full features, macros and customization.  The Anker mouse had great reviews so I thought I would put off the Deathadder purchase and try something else based on the Anker's reviews.<br /><br />I have been using a Razer Pro 1.6 for working and gaming and have been very happy with it.  However, the Pro 1.6 is a little too small for my hand and it's gotten pretty ugly as the matte finish has worn off.  The Anker is already at home on my desk and the Pro 1.6 is about to go into the drawer as a spare.<br /><br />The Anker Gaming mouse is very well built and pretty large. My wife thinks it is humungous! I love the light touch buttons and they are big as well. The side button are really nice and big and have contrasting textures so you can use them by feel instead of just position. I think I use a claw grip gaming and palm while working. Unlike another reviewer I do notice the difference when using the weight plugs.  I put them in right out of the box and found the mouse too heavy.  I took them out and I wish the mouse were still a little lighter, but this may be due to the very light weight of the Razer Pro 1.6 I've been using for years.<br /><br />The software is really great as well.  You can set up a number of ways to change the sensitivity on the fly, either by switching between up to 4 presets, or by + or - buttons. The presets are indicated by 4 small LED lights on the left front edge, which is a really nice touch.  I do wish the mouse sensitivity slider had + and - buttons and finer adjustment dents with a numerical value shown.  By combining the Anker control mouse sensitivity, DPI and in-game mouse sensitivity you can really get a great feel with the Anker.  For BF3, I put the Anker sensitivity low the DPI at 1800 and the BF3 in game very low with a 4.3\\" in-game 360o.  Works great with Sniping and CQ. The Raw Mouse in BF3 doesn't seem to matter with the Anker software running, which is just fine.  The Anker softwarealso has an acceleration slider which is nice, although I leave it at 0 for work and play.<br /><br />Personally, I do not prefer the thumb shelf on the left, and I would love a button or two on the right side as well as the left, but this is just a personal matter.<br /><br />Overall, I must say this mouse has been great for working with Adobe software as well as for FPS shooters (currently BF3), crawlers Torchlight2, Starcraft2 and Company of Heroes.<br /><br />Update: my mouse experienced a problem with an LED light and Anker customer service handled the replacement perfectly. They got back to me promptly and very satisfactorily.  Will certainly recommend.
B000002MY3|5.0|What can I say - it is Alanis Morissette - and she is at her best!  well done and one to keep playing
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Great show. Kevin Spacey is very strong, with stellar supporting cast. Looking forward to more shows. That's all for now.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book doesnt need a review - it delivered exactly what all they hype had predicted.  The series was worth the read
193700788X|1.0|I've been reading this series for the past three years now, and I've defended Charlaine Harris from scores of people who said she was a bad writer. Today, I know they were right. She is. I've never been more disappointed in a book. Apart from being poorly written and boring, I could see the \\"plot twists\\" coming from miles away. These mysteries aren't very mysterious, more like feeble contrivances that cannot bear much scrutiny. Much of what happens in this book makes little sense. The villains' motives are ridiculous. A lot of retcon is done to get things where the author wanted them. This is writing at its laziest. None of the characters have the spark that once made them interesting. The resolution of the series is pathetic for everyone involved. Overall, I felt like the author put no effort into this. I am left very dissatisfied. I wish I hadn't bothered to read this book. I recommend that people not waste their time or money. Seriously, it's that bad. If you have to read it, get it from the library. If you did buy it, return it. I did.
B0081336FO|5.0|I would give this show 10 stars if I could. As it is, I didn't remotely worry about my job until I finished the episode. Probably could've been fired except that I work without a supervisor. THIS SHOW ROCKS!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I have never read a book that has too much sex in it, those of you who got ED read this book, better than Viagra
B002LHRM2E|5.0|A new view of project management that explains why projects are always late. Learn the culture change needed to get projects completed on time.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I like matching games and this one provides a nice twist.  it's challenging enough and it's nice to have a beginning and an end to each game.  It's fun to challenge myself to beat my own score. I will practice a bit more before doing any of the more advanced levels.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|After a month and a half of practice (30 minutes a day, 3 days a week) I am able to do more reps during pull-ups and longer headstands than before. I follow the schedule recommended by Paul Wade towards the end of the book. It gives me a very simple routine to stick to and workout the entire body. What keeps this book apart from anything else is the 'Progressions' established and explained here- a systematic method to increase workout intensity as your strength increases. This helps both novices and those who have been working out for a long time.<br />The simplicity of the approach and the captivating narration in this book helped me finish reading it in one night. Three days later I had started my workout; now I am gonna stick with it for life.
B002T9H2ME|4.0|Until streaming hi resolution movies becomes ubiquitous, I like to buy my movies in Blu Ray format.<br />Sweeping landscape, Sci-Fi movies like this, definitely justify the slightly higher cost.<br /><br />The story line on this movie was like \\"The Shining on the moon\\".<br />Solitary, but still cinematography compelling.<br /><br />The plot is similar, and if I must be cryptic about the plot, it reminds me of when one catches a reflection of a mirror in a mirror, and it extends as far as the eye can see.  Overall, not Earth shattering, but much better than a car chase/shootem up.  Period.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book had history, suspense, intrigue, romance wrapped up<br />in beautiful words.  I would read this book again and again.
B009R659L8|3.0|I always loved Mary Higgins Clark mysteries.  This one is just fair, in my opinion.  It kept my interest enough, but I still haven't finished it.  Unless it has a huge twist at the end, it's fairly predictable.  Ms. Clark has been writing for many, many years, but maybe it's time for her to retire.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love the different available sounds and the ability to layer them.<br />It's also nice that I'm able to save my favorite mixes.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Adventure storytelling at its best. My 12 year old son and I both enjoyed this book very much.  Twists and turns keep you turning pages.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Excellent information.This information series helps a person learn to talk to people that he don,t know.thanks for the help.Thanks a lot.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|This is a great book about using lean tools while being agile to meet customer needs. I would recommend this book to anyone
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|Very boring picture, it was a mistake to rent it. You might be misguided by the good actors in it
B0083SBMBM|2.0|Super heroes come a dime a dozen and most of them are here in this film.<br />I found it hooky, predictable, and highly overrated.<br />It is OK for the thirteen and under viewer... but for adults... ? Skip it.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Very good picture, easy to see and not complicated like the films of today. Also, is a clean story, not all about sex...
B001OGRIWW|5.0|I originally purchased this on 8-track in 1978, and haven't listened to the album since I ditched my 8-track player in 1982.  For a 35 year old recording, it has held up very well, much more listenable today than much of the music of that era.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Probably the only season that somewhat hangs on to a bit of reality.  Sad but the best actor in season one is missing from season two!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I haven't been this absorbed by a book in years! When it's hard to put down, life continues around you even when you forget about it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book is great.<br />I was a bit curious because of the format chosen, a personal log. But during the book it changed, and added some third-person from different locations.<br />20% into the book, I just had to read on and on, I was so curious to see what would happen next.<br /><br />This is a book about a believable scenario where an astronaut gets stranded on Mars.<br />The tech is today, or possibly from the next ten years. I liked a lot how the main character describes the challenges he meets, and detailes how he overcomes them.<br /><br />Get the book, it'll be time well spent!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great book, could not put it down, I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a real mystery with lots of suspense.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This was her best. I hear its also the last. Which is fine because this wrapped everything up, perfectly.  There could not have been a better finale to this epic series. I am a very pleased reader. Very.
B00025HI62|5.0|I was glad to find this still available, and still unopened at that!  The longer version, I found out, was NEVER released on DVD.  I'm assuming this is because the &#34;cutting room floor&#34; films that were inserted to make the movie longer were used that one time and then disposed of, so there's no way to make a widescreen version with the additional footage.  (This version was cropped to the 4x3 aspect ratio.)  A shame, but that's okay. At least we can still see the alternate version of the film.
B0011Z51T8|5.0|Such a great artist, and an amazing group one of my favs of all time. a must own for music lovers
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Loved all 3 books. Lisbeth Salander is my hero. I wish there were more strong/vulnerable characters as beautifully written as she. The plot and characters are all so complex. Serious page turner. Recommend to anyone who loves crime thrillers.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|its sinatra what more should I say. so awesome and fun for any event or time of day, takes you back to a time of delight and grace. a must own if you love music.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Very sad, made me cry.  The acting is amazing.  I wasn't  familiar with this families story, which made it very intense to watch
B000SEHJGQ|4.0|He was as disgusting in real life as the partly autobiographical characters that fill his pages. His punctuation is as spastic as the hammer throw at the Special Olympics. Yet, his is master at the crude one liner, and I feel that grittiness is his primal appeal.
B009CCBCU4|5.0|Free books are always good! I expected free books to be less than enjoyable, but they are not! I have enjoyed every free book I've read and can't wait to get the next ones!
0788859544|3.0|My DVD was damaged; it started skipping and having bad quality the first time I opened it and watched it (the DVD was sold as &#34;new&#34;.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|Read about 75 pages and realized I was nit enjoying it, so put it down for good.  Friends in a book club had the same experience.  Very disappointing.
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|From the basis of moving making, this is a great movie. However, I personally am very offended with the idea of Kids killing kids and for it to be glorified by charactors in the movie. What kind of message is this sending our children? It is morally wrong and reflects on has far our society has sunk. No wonder we have the societal issues we have.
B000FC1CYG|5.0|This is a long novel, but the author manages to dispense clues (along with building several of my favorite characters in all literature) at the perfect pace.  The result is I couldn't put this book down until I finished it.  Household chores were left undone, bedtimes were ignored.  I enjoyed every minute of it.
B005HEPOKU|5.0|I really enjoyed the original series but found the acting over done. Next Gen has far better effects, for the most part acting is not exaggerated making the series enjoyable. Story lines are very good as well. This series was a worthy successor to the orginal.
B00124PXW8|5.0|My son and I watched it together and I wondered if it would scare him too much (just 11) but he enjoyed it, even the special effects which against today's standards aren't so \\"special\\". No nightmares yet.....except that one where he woke up screaming his sister's head was spinning around on her neck....oh we'll, right of passage, I guess!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is amazing! Such great actors. The quality through amazon video library is awesome as well and I don't have to wait for my product to arrive via mail!
B00CKR63F2|5.0|I was immediately hooked when I started reading this book! It's well-written, and grabs your attention in the very first chapter. I don't want to put it down and can't wait to read more as the story unfolds and I get to know the characters. It's one of those books where I can't wait to see what happens, but I don't want to finish it and have the story end. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I am!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Good book from interesting and multiple points of view. It is a must read for any horror or war history fan!
B0061PEAUY|4.0|The ending wasn't a big surprise but it made sense. I learned about the diamond mining in Canada and its impact on small towns in NW Canada. I enjoyed the read all the way through.
B005LF9KMI|4.0|i like stephen king - so i like a lot of the movies based on his books. even though it's a bit dated, it's good.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Just a fantastic book. The journey that Pi makes is amazing and this well crafted story does not fail to deliver
B00797MB0O|2.0|I didn't really enjoy it.  I normally like Carlize Theron but this movie was boring and I didn't like the character.  Ok if you didn't have anything else to do.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I have to start by saying I am a fan of Nelson DeMille.  I enjoyed each of the John Corey novels, and this is no exception.  It is not the best of the novels, and in fact, I might say this is overall the least enjoyable, but that is mostly splitting hairs.  Introducing Paul Brenner (From the General's Daughter and Up Country) was an interesting twist, but I found myself wanting to read something from his voice as well since he is a known character.  The book starts in typical Corey style, sort of drags a little in the middle, but the last 140 pages or so is full of action and I couldn't put it down.  For DeMille fans, this is probably slightly disappointing, but still worth a read.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|All in all it was a great book/series but it did end rapidly.  All the loose ends have been tied but I wish they didn't do it so abruptly.
B00139XSBA|5.0|Enjoyed the explanation of each Astronaut's personality and accomplishment. It is especially revealing of the early space program. Fun read!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Could not believe my luck in finding these for the prices that I purchased them for, What a wonderful find.
B0054SMID0|5.0|This was a great movie with a really interesting story. I will be watching it again. I got it on my Kindle with my Prime membership and I will be watching this again!
1587613379|5.0|book came in excellent condition. basically brand new.<br /><br />the book itself is a little hippie (rather than based in empirical study) for my taste but i think a useful guide to introduce a needed paradigm in sexual morality. writing is pretty good too.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|This book gives great insight on how devs and operations teams should be working together to meet the business goals.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|The book was great and detailed many of the same challenges most IT teams face.  In fact, it was so well written, it made me feel like I had TWO stressful jobs.<br /><br />I loved the details on Lean manufacturing and how that maps to IT.  Now that I think about it, it's amazing how much WIP is sitting around most places.<br /><br />Lean manufacturing takes ALOT of work, flexibility, and unconventional thinking.  The book does a great job of laying that out (and its benefits).  I don't want to spoil the book but if you ever see leadership this bad, RUN!
B009NY43NY|1.0|So disappointed in this book.  I held out hope until the very last page but was disappointed and nauseated by the ending.<br /><br />Here's how I look at it:<br />Some novels are well written and moving; the words transport you, move you, and inspire you no matter where the plot goes or what happens to the characters.<br /><br />Mrs. Harris is not one of these types of writers.  Her books have a following because of Sookie and her relationship with vampires, espcially with Eric.  She had created magic between those two.  Turning her back on that magic and her fans?  Not a wise move Mrs. Harris.  I will not be reading anything else of yours.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I downloaded this, but didn't launch it because you have to connect to FB.  I'm no interested in having the FB connection.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Family and friends all enjoy watching this. Adults thirty and older most likely remember the show. Our adolescent grandchildren love this series and I am pleased they get to see outside a history book what the Old West was about. I no longer feel the need to rent a video when I know they are coming for a visit. It is a family classic.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This story is pretty raw but gives you insight into the unbelievable impact and damage of the Tsunami and the struggle of a family to survive.
B000SEI230|4.0|Its hard not to tear up reading this book.  If you just want a nice sappy read that reminds you that there is still good in the world, pick this one up.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Great story about love and tenacity. All characters are wonderful. A different kind of love story. I bought it and have watched twice
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|I didn't think I was going to like a book in the voice of Darcy, but I did!  I loved &#34;Something Borrowed&#34; and am now happy I read the sequel.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Great movie kids loved it will watch again love the free movies please add more to the choices will keep coming back.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|My wife wanted to see this after she read the book while being pregnant, she says it is one of the worst movies she ever saw and wished that she didn't waste her time watching it hoping it'll pick up after sometime.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I love the dvd set but my daughter loves the move and the songs too!!!!!!The cost was great deal the shipping was good too and I would buy from this seller again because im happy with the service. Thank you so much!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is so addicting. I play this game all the time. It is a little bit like temple run but it is a lot more fun.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|The pricing and delivery were great.  But the movie is just fabulous.  You will be talking about this one for days after for the hidden meanings.  It was like the movie 'Inception' in making you talk and discuss.  Spoiler alert:  There are two possible story lines and you choose the one you want to believe.  I chose to believe the story like the Japanese insurance investigators.  The cinematography is just unbelievable....absolutely  deserved the Oscar.  Another stellar directing job by Ang Lee.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A wonderful look into the life-styles of the British peerage at the beginning of the 20th century: how the upstairs/downstairs view of their lives affected the inhabitants of the Abbey and its surrounding village. Most Americans have never experienced the graceful existence of Your Lordship and My Lady. Also, how WWI had such a profound effect of the lives of the entire world.<br />Have not finished yet, but we are trying to catch up on the series!
B007SGM084|5.0|My wife loves it.  She read it in a week and wouldn't put it down.  I guess it was worth the read...she's hooked now to 50 shades..
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My 2 boys have taken over my tablet playing this game. I now have to set time limits they love it so much. I like that they have to read and use spelling in this game while having so much fun . Perfect !
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|I really enjoyed for the most part. It was intriguing exploring how far they were going take human simulations for the various android like or robotic creations. Some of the boy/girl stuff between young Connor and his girlfriend were a bit tedious,but necessary to a point. I am just sorry the the series,like so many, did not make it beyond the second season. But clearly something must have gone wrong for the viewership to drop like it did. Either that or the series poorly placed in the time slots and did not get enough exposure.I usually don't watch anything beyond 11 PM and if this was the case,its no wonder it failed and was dropped. Anyway it was good and could have been great if given a chance,but I feel maybe just 2 more seasons would have been sufficient to rap it up on the Armageddon theme.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 10yo Niece. She's obsessed with minecraft and I do a bit of playing myself. This set is somewhat difficult depending on the kid, mostly because it contains a ton of the smallest lego pieces they make. There are no large blocks whatsoever. It was fun to build with her and it has some value for playing because it is actually modular. You can snap each piece apart with ease and put it all together in a nice square shape again to put away. There is a dungeon underneath to explore and a little house on the top.<br /><br />Nothing amazing, but you get what you're expecting. Never been disappointed with lego quality.
1594487154|4.0|Uses research to back up practical suggestions. Pitch chapter and exercises made you really think about what you want your audience to think, feel and do. Recommended this book to rest of sales force.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its so fun. If you go on every day there is the daily challenge. And I love mystery boxes. Bye!
B00BOLFRKW|4.0|I rarely have time to visit a theater but I wanted to see the highly praised movie. I had that opportunity when I was given a 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD. I was able to download the entire film - but I was surprised at the time consumed completing the download. I then went to Radio Shack to buy an HDMI cable - Kindle instructions did not tell me about that.
1932735410|5.0|This is a great buy, using this book and reading PMBOK was a great support to pass the exam. I definitely recommend to buy it.
B004LWZW24|5.0|My favorite scary movie so far! I love the song they play in it. Tiny Tim's : Tip toe through the tulips!
B003IY49S4|5.0|I'm not sure if it's a &#34;perfect&#34; collection, because several important Columbia titles have been left out (Sketches Of Spain; Mingus, Ah-Um?) and there are several &#34;questionable&#34; titles that have been included.  However, it is a great primer for anyone who's interested in Jazz history.  And it was great to see a Weather Report and a solo Jaco LP included.  And speaking of LPs, let me just say that the mini reproduction record covers are a thing of beauty.  Not as nice as some of the earlier Japanese issues, but at this price it's wonderful to get them at all.
B00415ZW58|5.0|This is one of my favorite Taiwanese dramas! I'm a huge fan of both Jerry and Ella, they have Greg chemistry together!
B00632HWOG|2.0|This app does not update with new emails. There is no function, that I can see, where you can refresh to get new emails.
B00C1C123E|4.0|My two sons loved it. We're watching the third installment next movie night. We would love to see the Indiana Jones movies offered on AIV.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Smart, interesting, and funny at times. Refreshing to see someone who is honest, both in sincerity and weaknesses as the central character.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|This movie's cinematics were eye-catching, although it used a familiar formula as seen in The Usual Suspects. Moral of the story could have been more relevant. Embellishing the truth with untruths is still lying.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was great, couldn't put it down. A must read now waiting on the third one to come in.
B0076DELIG|4.0|another good Bosch story about a lost soul-Bosch. He does need to be more connected to his team for them to really feel as supportive of him as they are portrade to be.
B005IZLPME|5.0|I have been a part of the Avengers Universe of movies since the beginning, although I did not see Edward Norton's Hulk until a few years after the release. Marvel may have had issues with the X-Men Universe but the Avengers movies are fantastic and this one continues the trend. I am eager to see the sequel and hope the Avengers series continues to do well.
B008Y73940|5.0|I loved everything about this movie--unpredictable plot, imperfect characters, satisfying ending, and some light moments to lift the mood.  I do NOT recommend for under 17, and certainly not under 13, due to the graphic, sexual violence that is shown in flashbacks of the crimes he is dealing with.  I didn't let my kids watch it, and you shouldn't let yours, unless they're already hopelessly jaded from watching the evening news.  Other than that, this is just good, solid entertainment for a mature audience.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Story well told. Informative. Interesting how people view situations. A must read for all! Highly recommend. Great from cover to cover.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I like the plot and the main characters. I would recommend this book for a fun summer read. It is dark but thats how I like my books.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|My children watched this movie when they were young and now I have a young grandson who is starting to enjoy animated movies. I bought this for him for Easter and he loves it! Another Disney classic that will surely please generations to come.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|All through the four seasons Modern Family has maintained its quality as the #1 comedy on TV. the writing is hysterical, the acting is top. I look forward to continuing seasons.
B00BG4UWPC|4.0|The cd is good. A lot of new good songs for all your phoenix lovers out there. Glad they came out with a new cd because its been a couple years since the last, amdeous wolfgang album.
0062059963|5.0|We need the third one!  This is a great sequel to a great book.  I think it is a must read.
B0006Z2KYI|5.0|I am a fanatical fan of Carole Lombard. I've watch almost all of her films, and been up to the crash site of TWA #3 in Nevada. I read books about her, and studied her life deeply. She was more than an actress, but an artist, and a human-being with interest in the people and country around her. From an era when film acting was still an art without special effects.  Carole Lombard finished filming \\"To Be or Not To Be\\" in December of 1941 but sadly was killed in a plane crash in January of 1942 while returning home on TWA Flight #3 after doing a war bond tour to raise money for our military now involved in WWII. She was declared the first female casualty of WWII by President FDR himself.  \\"To Be or Not To Be\\" is a five star film. The comical yet serious acting is wonderful. Jack Benny was spot on, and a newbie known as Robert Stack (later known as host of \\"Unsolved Mysteries\\") was fabulous . Carole Lombard plays this film beautifully. Although her part is smaller than her previous roles and is her second film back into comical roles (the pervious being \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" from 1941) after a short run at dramatic roles, she once again steals the show. This film was released in March of 1942 but because of Lombard's death, and our occupation in WWII, it fizzled at the box office but would gain cult status and become known as one of the best films of the 1940s in later decades.  This movie is in many ways a precurusr to \\"Hogan's Heroes\\" and has that same comical stab, and profiling \\"lets make fun of Nazi Germany\\" during WWII. In fact some of the German characters like \\"Capt Schultz\\" from the 1960s show \\"Hogan's Heroes\\" seem to be ripped off straight from \\"To Be or Not To Be\\" (1942) with \\"Cap Shultz\\" having the same name and personna in both \\"To Be or Not To Be\\" (1942) and \\"Hogan's Heroes\\" (1965-1971). I would recommend this film, and give this film five out of five stars. Carole Lombard fans of \\"My Man Godfrey\\" (1936) and \\"True Confessions\\" (1937) will love this film asthose fans of \\"Hogan's Heroes\\". I also highly recommend the 1983 Mel Brooks remake of \\"To Be or Not To Be\\" and is one of the few times I can say the remake is just as good or equal to the original. However I would be warry of high priced DVD sales of this film, and would pay no more than $12.00 for a new DVD copy.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Loved it. Very authentic for that era. Good acting. Not boring.<br />Also enjoyed the remaining seasons. Look forward to new season.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Diamond dash is an awesome game I can't stop playing it....I am truly addicted I can't count how much endless fun I have playing
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I love this charger because it fits my kindle touch, my blackberry torch 9810, and my palm pixi plus!  One stop shopping to charge them all.<br /><br />It would be difficult for me to use 3 different chargers because I'm bedridden and cannot reach the outlet.  Only 2 can be plugged in at a time, so I would need someone to rotate them every day. Thankfully, I don't have to do that! Any bit of independence I can hold onto is a good thing.<br /><br />I also like that it can be plugged into the computer.  The laptop will charge all 3 items, and it allows me to easily transfer files to/from my kindle, blackberry, and palm.<br /><br />Surprisingly useful little wire!
B003VPOXAE|5.0|I'm a 13 year old girl, and this is one of greatest books I have ever read. Period. The characters are very easy to relate with. You can find a piece of yourself in all of them. Not having grown up in even really the 90s, it's awesome to see what life was like in the 60s for both races, including thw segregation. I would most certainly recommend this to a friend.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This movie is such a mix of humor, romance, life's tragedies and the ability our hearts have to go full circle and heal. Love it!
B008VBYN80|5.0|this game is so amazing I feel like I'm going through a slip n slide. it makes me happy to play this yes mhm:)
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Great series and the streaming HD was great quality. It didn't hang and the response time was immediate. Would definitely use again
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I was pretty intrigued with the book and was able to empathize with the author in many ways. It seemed she had a lot of hardships very early in her adult life, and it's good to know that she was able to overcome her demons and find herself through this crazy long hike.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time! I'd definitely recommend this movie to anyone....
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Lots of action and new enemies/plot line. You will love this new season. Rick kind of goes crazy though but all and all was a good season.
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|This is one of the best pilots I've seen in years. The writing is crisp and interesting, the visuals are BEAUTIFUL, and I really love the whole cast. I had serious trouble understanding Mads Mikkelsen at first, but I just put the subtitles on and I was fine. I really love the idea of exploring the back story of these iconic characters, and so far it's been really great to watch.<br /><br />Also? I'm autistic, so Hugh Dancy's Will Graham being described as being on the spectrum while having \\"pure empathy\\" means the absolute world to me. One of the most hurtful and offensive myths about autistics is that we allegedly can't feel empathy, and that's just not true. We feel it in a different way than most, but we feel it. I'm so grateful there's an autistic character who's real and true, and not just some zombie stereotype.
B006CUDDUG|4.0|I would recommend to anyone who like spy novels.  LeCarre weaves an excellent story with a great ending.  I plan to continue to read him in the future.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Fantastic. Leaves you wanting more and more. I can't wait for season 3 to come out and buy that 1.
B008602KQI|4.0|I enjoyed the movie a lot but missed a lot of the background info that was in the book.  If you haven't read the book, you might get a little lost in the movie.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This series leaves you wanting more and more. Now I can see why it is such a big hit. Always leaves you on your seats.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was my first read by Landay and it won't be my last. Loved the book and as a former teacher, could relate. I really liked the point of view coming from the accused parents and not the victims. It is one of those books that stays with you for a long time after you finish it. I highly recommend this read.
B0099116AY|5.0|Besides this being an enjoyable movie with superb acting, It is excellent for reviewing which stage of marriage that a couple may be in. It is exaggerated for the comedy, but can stimulate an honest discussion about ones own marriage.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I like how it gets harder after each night and how you can upgrade your missiles.  I also like how the missile doesn't destroy the whole building you can fix it.  so I recommend get thidls game
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Stellar writing, excellent acting, suspenseful yet believable plot lines. The Good Wife is the best network television has to offer. Don't miss it!
0988178532|5.0|This is a powerful and compelling work.  Read it now!! Lots of insights but most of all incredibly entertaining.  And I can't wait until the next book.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie is the greatest of all time. Really gives you a feel  for the power of nature and gods ever indurung plan when he wants to straigjhten you. I felt a heart felt passion throughout the movie and sorrow for patel a young adult to endure such a tragidy and life changing event. I would invite everyone who has not seen this movie to watch. You will not regret it. The cinematics and screen play flow great throughout the entire film. Great movie.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Has a sexy blues voice that is smooth,  My 2nd album with her.  That was because she was singing and Joe Bonamassa was playing.  Great combination
1572707208|3.0|didn't hold my interest!  I did give them to my son to review.  I'm sure that he will use them wisely.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|It is a good book, almost a companion to the 4 Hour Work Week by Timothy Ferris. It gives some great ideas and tips about how to begin thinking of real ways to get away from a 9-5 job and focus on making money through your own business. Highly recommended.
0981951252|5.0|I truly love this series because it teaches you how to build the life that you want.  I liked everything about it and couldn't find anything that I disliked.  I gave them to my son to listen.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Who wrote this book?  Sookie was mean and the book was so off. CH was done before this book was ever started. Pathetic story that made little to no sense.  So much jumbled into so little and the heavy religious overtone was OOC for this series
B00785P2QC|5.0|you get to make your Dreams of a city come true you can build the statute of liberty you get to expand,buy,upgrade and destroy
B00CQ1YJKI|5.0|But why is \\"Risk Management\\" not available to buy. I hope it will be available with the season finale. This was a really great episode, they are all so great. I think Jonny Lee Miller should win an Emmy for his brilliant portrayal of Sherlock Holmes. I watched the British series, Sherlock, and enjoyed it, but Elementary is so much better. I love Lucy Lui as Watson. They have great chemistry as friends. I am glad they are not planning any romance between the two. That would ruin the show.
B0099114WO|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie ,a lesson for us all. The condition of this movie upon arrival with excellent. I would recommend this movie to my friends.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Could'nt put the book down. Well written & gripping. Makes you feel in the middle of the plot. If you like courtroom drama, this is a good read.
0767821769|5.0|This is a great story with its sad and happy times. I would recommend this move to everyone I know. The condition of this movie upon arrival was excellent.
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|This book has a unique story. It is original and so different from what have been written lately. The way the story unfolds is incredible. Huff progressively gives us the information we need, mantaining us interested in every event, but surprising us chapter by chapter. He also manages to keep us focused between the stories in the two worlds, transmitting Owen Sage's and The Keeper's emotions and perceptions quite well.What I enjoyed the most, was the vocabulary used, just adequate.<br /><br />The level of description was so great, I enjoyed every detail in every page of the book. Such beautiful descriptions of scenery and sensations. I felt transported to Everville, just as Owen Sage did.<br /><br />This could be the start of a new great and memorable fantasy saga.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is fun and the story line is somewhat entertaining especially for kids but it tends to lag a bit and I have had to delete the app and start over because something went wrong with a download
B009QD0MYQ|5.0|This is an epic band for the fact that they have 3 singers, all of which are great. The lyrics are great, sounds amazing.<br /><br />Female vocals get an A+++++ in my opinion, she's simply amazing.<br />Male vocalist sounds great as well, very talented.<br />Screamer sounds good I guess. Not a fan of screamo stuff, but I can say the variety he brings adds alot to the songs
B005HSL626|4.0|It's fun but it's a bit hard. Entertaining to help pass the time when you are in the car waiting for someone, lol.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Heard it was great, and it was everything I had heard. Loved it. Can't wait for a new one to come out.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I have always loved this movie and now its even better being on a blu ray in beautiful HD it really brings the movie to life once again.
B00511ONPG|5.0|This was the first book I read that introduced me to the world of social media marketing.<br /><br />As a twenty-two year old, I have everyday exposure to multiple social media websites. With over one billion users, Facebook has enormous potential for marketers, and this book showed me exactly how companies are using the site to build their brands. Now, even the smallest customer has the power to influence the biggest brands!<br /><br />\\"Likeable Social Media\\" is well-organized and very well-written. There are many actionable ideas, and also great examples of companies that have used the methods described in the book.<br /><br />Definitely 5 stars for me...A must-read for anyone involved in marketing!
B003PBB4ME|5.0|The price is on the money, the quality isn't bad at all, and overall this stabilizer is great for the price.

B003VIWO9I|5.0|Story is interesting and thrilling. As always there is a message in the story. Also I liked that it plugs in a bit to earlier books giving it more context.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Omg why did it have to end I was completely enthralled!! Not a boring page in the book my eyes were glued to it the whole time!
193700788X|2.0|I enjoyed reading the book as I have all of her previous works but I will have to say I was very dissapointed in the way Sookie's life turned out.  Sure, it was one disaster and adventure after another and evidently she or the author had grown tired  but as someone who has a fairly boring life, I enjoyed that about her very much.  I have not watched True Blood and probably never will.  I tried that with the Stephanie Meyers series and television can never do justice to what pleasure you can achieve just by reading about something that you know doesnt exist but wished could.  I hate to think badly of the author but it does seem like she sold out to Hollywood and really didnt care anymore about her fans or the characters that she developed.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I spend hours on here, I might not buy alot but it's fun to browse most of the catagories like coins,computers and a host of other favorites.

B00CPM6PE6|5.0|Amazing show! First few episodes were a little rough but once it really got into things it was awesome. Reminds me of a mix between lost, smallville and the dark knight. Awesome storyline and pace.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I heard so many people say this movie was amazing and it truly was! The way they capture every detail on what goes on during a Tsunami makes you realize the power of mother nature. Tear jerker for sure.
0439023521|5.0|This book was amazing, couldn't put it down. The only thing I could say that was negative about this book was that it wasn't long enough. Even with the other two books in the trilogy I wish they had been longer!
B000005AYL|3.0|Good album, poor record quality, as in the sleeve is a generic back sleeve with a small sticker on it, no album notes/lyrics. record was one of those thin ones, which was also a bit warped when it arrived,  It did cost $5 dollars or so, so it was still a bargain.<br />Music is good, I'm not a modern day r&b lover by a long shot, but this is good, great voice, very laid back music.  slightly odd production, which works.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is a great and fun game. you can choose from different charactars once you unlock them. but sometimes it messes up. it freezes every once in a while and messes up your game and makes you die or doesn't do a move that you do.
B004U8VX2M|4.0|This is a novel-like series with insights into English life in the early 1900's.  The characters add drama as the 13 shows unfold.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|i just knew I'd love this cd/dvd as much as the first one!  These guys are just so talented.  Words truly fall short of describing just how much I LOVE this new edition.  Keep up the GREAT work Guys!<br /><br />PS - Please come to Indiana for a show, as well as St. George - Tuachan.......
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I loved that the characters we all know and love were portrayed with offbeat style, humor, and wit. The underlying message was positive and yet the movie wasn't preachy.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Wonderful music - just so different from other artists out there.  This is a 'must-buy' cd for everyone who enjoys great music from extremely talented musicians.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Finally rod is making music like he used to. Great album. I liked his standards albums but this one I  really enjoy because the lyrics reflects the feelings of an old fogey like me.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Okay so I'm a kid at heart.  But, this movie had a good message, good jokes, good animation.  Yes, my grandkids liked it too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the trilogy straight on through.  It was a very entertaining read once I got used to the different &#34;world&#34; that things were occurring in
B0015AARJI|2.0|or is super fast great purchase and excellent battery lasts much not what else to say because I buy for gift packaging and so but that well
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I love the program Bones and expected that the book would be an extension of it. Not true. Just an okay book. Too Bad. I will stick with the show.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I really liked this movie.  Very realistic picture of mental illness in a fun and creative story.  I really liked Bradley Cooper and DeNiro, though obviously Jennifer Lawrence was great too winning the Oscar.
B004U8VX2M|4.0|Having watched Upstairs Downstais faithfully when is was new, this is a pleasant memory waker. The acting is excellent, but the sets pale against their thirty year later sucessors.  All in all, this is a reminder of why we watched faithfully.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Thank you Charlaine Harris for a lovely end to your female powered series. Although I am not as in love with this book as some of the others, I do love how you have kept your characters faithful to their well written identities. I think this book will sit better with me after a second reading. However, nothing will top your final two sentences in the book. Loved that ending.
B0081336FO|5.0|There have been excellent Sherlock Holmes films and television series in the 20th Century. The more recent films have been more &#34;star vehicles&#34;  than good story telling. Enter the very different contemporary seasons. The producers and writers have taken the stories, and re-told them in a 21st century light.<br /><br />The characters are alive in this series. The stories are very well written, and are full of surprizes for Holmes fans. I suspect that people who see this series, will react much like the original readers of Conan Doyles stories did in their time.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I'm not the typical demographic for this show (40-something) but I love it.  It's just suspensful enough and I'm not completely up to date on all episodes!  When does the next season start???
B003730LRY|3.0|Unfortunately you will be disappointed. Its luke warm dishwater to the television show. Save your time and your money, rent the television version

B0062NAX1U|5.0|Product arrived earlier than expected.  Product in great condition.  Great movie.  Very inspiring.  Thought about setting aside a voluntary training day for the line officers.  This job has killed all but 4 marriages in my department in the last 10 years.  Two of the ones that are still married and on their first wife are rookies and got married within the year.  The other two are off-line working administration.  Sad stats but could be prevented.
0316017930|5.0|Outliers: The Story of Success is a rare piece of literature that has altered the way that I've come to perceive success. Gladwell explains that successful people often achieve great things in life because of a series of external factors, which Gladwell refers to as \\"outliers.\\" Gladwell suggests that while intelligence and knowhow are important attributes, circumstantial occurrences together with timing and luck are equally important. Furthermore, Gladwell contends that individuals must also have an ability to recognize and capitalize on opportunities when they arise.<br /><br /> The first chapter got me hooked onto this book. Gladwell first talks about a \\"neither undeserved nor earned\\" advantage of being born at a certain time of the year (called The Matthew Effect). Take for example two kids born in 1994. One is born on the first day of the year while the other is born on the last day of the year. The difference is just one day short of 365 days, almost one whole year. Nevertheless, they are born in the same year and will be placed in the same grades in school. Because the older kid is nearly a year older, he or she will be ahead in mental and physical development by almost one year. The result? The older kid does learns the material quickly and performs better in school while the younger student, nearly a year younger, may struggle in comparison. What happens then? The teacher may see this and place the older student in more challenging classes to help the student develop further.<br /><br />The first chapter's the takeaway is that the time of year in which you're are born can contribute to your success. Furthermore, Gladwell explains in a later chapter that the era in which one is born is another crucial factor. If I get married and decide to have kids, my spouse and I might plan it so that the child is born in the first quarter of the year.<br /><br /> The Matthew Effect, among others ideas, will transform your view of the world and people around you. You may become grateful for seemingly trivial people or occurrences; you may realize that some of your parents' traits are manifested in yourself in ways you did not realize (chapter regarding math); you may say, \\"Perhaps I can better position myself for success if I develop certain skills\\" (chapter about possibly the smartest man in the world, Chris Langan, who \\"despairs of ever getting published in a scholarly journal\\" because he lacks social skills).<br /><br /> In all, this book is a must read for people of all ages. I will serve as a mentor to incoming freshmen at Baruch College and hope to make this book a mandatory read for all incoming students.<br /><br />Note: the author does get repetitive with previous outliers as he movies onto new ones since some success stories involve multiple outliers.
B0064MGU98|4.0|... but the sex is a bit too overt for my taste.  I am drawn in by the compassion and the humanity with which the firm and the attorneys and especially Alicia treat the clients.
0679805273|5.0|This is the most inspirational book and to have been written by the artistic, creative, Dr. Seuss.  This is a MUST present for anyone you may wish to inspire their success!!

B009NY43NY|4.0|Some people really don't like this book but I thought that Sookie stayed true to character. There were complaints about character growth and development. For crying out loud, this is all pretend people. I never wanted Sookie to end up as a vampire or with her vampire Eric. She ended up pretty much the same way she started out, uniquely herself.
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|It was a good movie, it was freaky, kept me on edge but it wasn't quite as scary as the previews made it out to be...

B0052REUW0|4.0|We hear so much news every day about violence and bad things happening that it is hard to believe it is actually declining. But, Pinker has, in this book, shown how things really are much less violent than in the distant (and not so distant) past.
B007MOU6ZQ|4.0|I volunteer at the Red Cross in the book section. We have stacks of self help books and I have often wondered if they have worked for people . Personally I cannot do affirmations - just emphasises my self doubts. I did once pick up a book on Positive thinking and then put it down, stating - no I won't read it. so this book title appealed to me and I was not disappointed. I could also relate to our attitude death.
1594484805|3.0|While I'm still at a point in life where things are relatively new, I find this book interesting enough to give it a try. While the book itself is not a short read nor a hefty book, I would suggest taking your time in reading it if you're almost brand new like me.<br /><br />Reading Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us by Daniel H. Pink gave me new insights on what some employers have been doing over the years in regards of their employees' career development. The book goes on to explain that with the research Pink has done based on over forty years of research on human motivation, there are three key aspects that an employee seems to draw on for motivation. They are: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.<br /><br />As a rather unseasoned individual, I find those three key aspects redundant. That is not to say that they are any less important aspects when trying to figure out the best way to motivate employees. My reasoning behind this is because with over forty years, or as the summary says \\"four decades of scientific research,\\" the conclusion of those three key aspects was weak.<br /><br />Autonomy, mastery, and purpose, to me, they all scream common sense. Though it is important for the sake of the employee as well as the hiring company to work together in creating an environment where both can grow and help each other as time passes on, autonomy, mastery, and purpose are basic human nature. You do not need scientific research to find that employees are motivated by them, especially in the ever changing times of today where independency and self-empowerment are at an all-time high.<br />Despite the fact that I find the research redundant and outdated, I do agree with Pink in that what motivates workers the best is internal. Internal and external motivations are very different from each other, though they serve the same purpose (creating and honing one's motivation) which in turn would help them achieve a desired goal(s) in their field of work.<br /><br />However, where there is good, there is also bad. A pro of this would be that the employer would find it easier to connect with the employee, thus creating a more efficient work place that benefits both parties. Though a con would be he differing types of employees that an employer can encounter.<br /><br />For example, an employer can easily find a highly motivated worker (employee A) that always strives to do better as well as tries to grow in preference of a higher position in the future. At the same time, the same employer can find another worker (employee B) just 2 cubicles away, who has the same job as the aforementioned employee, for the sake of being able to pay for the monthly bills and nothing more. Pink's key aspects would be proven true with employee A, while with employee B, they would not work. The focus of the difference between them is that while Pink's key aspects can be applied to a broad range of workers, ultimately, motivation depends all on the specific individual at hand and no matter the use of tactics, an employer can only go so far to motivate them while still adhering to good business ethics.

B000JCQCW4|5.0|Never have I experienced such a visceral reaction to a movie. This film plunges deep into that realm of the mind, that place we all have were our deepest, most desperate desires live and breathe. To watch this movie is to run the gamet between the human condition and our own shared, human psyche. The original score, \\"Lux Aeterna\\", composed by the great Clint Mansell and performed by the Kronos Quartet, is like a tale unto itself, so perfectly accompanying the heart wrenching progression of the characters journey. Ellen Burstyn's performance is possibly the best in modern film history, earning her an Oscar nomination. Just promise you'll watch this movie, OK? IT IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is starting a revolution for good cause. The thought of having 50% of companies run by women and 50% of households run by men needs to be more than just a thought.

B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is phenomenal.  The sound quality and bass response is like nothing I've ever heard in a wired or wireless headset.<br />The only downside is that the unit is a bit heavier than other wired units, but it's very comfortable so you hardly notice the weight.<br />I've had heavier wired headphones (back in the 1/4\\" jack days), so this is nothing super heavy.  I could wear this for hours without any issue.<br />I also love the fact that it works while plugged in.  Battery running low?  You're not stuck putting it on the base unit, you can just plug in the micro-USB connection and keep on gaming!<br /><br />7.1 sounds works well, but it doesn't match the positional quality of discreet speakers.  However, it does work (which means I can hear people talking behind me in games as opposed to my old stereo headset that I barely heard an echo when someone was talking behind me).<br /><br />Overall, this headset is an excellent choice for any gaming rig.  It is far more durable than any other headset I've looked at (even much more expensive units).

B009GEFXLC|5.0|I just want to rate the product. Now they are saying I have to add more words. This will be the last time I rate a product.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|First off, this set is worth every penny spent on it. If you grew up with this series on network TV in your living room, seeing it now new and improved is nothing less than revelatory. For all its strengths and weaknesses each episode has something to offer, even the most obviously camp (Spock's Brain) or bluntly in-your-face (Patterns of Force, Let That Be Your Last Battlefield). Turnabout Intruder (the final episode) is fantastically over-the-top (to see William Shatner possessed by the spirit/essence of a psychotic woman, you can't do better)! Some of my favorite moments - the final 5 minutes of The Paradise Syndrome (the only episode in the series to end as such); Spock's crafty relationship with the Romulan commander in The Enterprise Incident; Merrick's sudden change of heart at the end of Bread and Circuses; Kirk's psych-out of Nomad in The Changeling; the whole creepy aura running throughout \\"Return of the Archons\\" and \\"Miri\\"; the phenomenal Doomsday Machine and the tragic yet noble self-sacrifice of Commodore Dekker...the list goes on. The transfers are eye-popping overall. The price might be high, but the care taken to make this a top-quality product almost seems justified.<br /><br />One thing that oddly enough is credited to Star Trek is the first interracial kiss - as the Amazon reviewer described, \\"The first interracial kiss on network primetime TV (between Shatner and series co-star Nichelle Nichols) furthered a richly positive and expansive view of a better, nobler future for humankind\\". The episode was Plato's Stepchildren, and Kirk and Uhura were forced to kiss by the telekinetic Platonians as part of a continuous sequence of degradation and demoralization. Neither Kirk nor Uhura enjoyed the experience (which is very obvious if you see the episode). So the Amazon reviewer either hasn't seen Plato's Stepchildren, or thinks that a better, nobler future for humankind includes forced interracial sexual overtures?ing to hear that by those who don't know any better (silly wabbit...).

0765342294|5.0|Ender's Game, a science fiction novel by Orson Scott Card, is a grandly written and stylish story that asks if any is truly innocent and who is the real bad guy. This story is told mostly through the eyes of the protagonist Andrew Wiggins (nicknamed Ender) and partially through the perspective of his loving older sister Valentine. Ender is a devilishly intelligent 3rd child in the near future after most of the human population has been destroyed by a war in space with an alien species nicknamed Buggers. Ender has been chosen by those in his government to become the savior of humankind by becoming the young commander of their fleet to protect humanity from the buggers. As this book progresses and Ender is put through more and more tests and training he begins to question whether he is the hero or the villain of the story. This questioning becomes one of the biggest themes of the novel. Ender's Game is a greatly written and Orson is one of the few writers who can capture how maniacal and brutish children really can be. Ender's Game is truly in a league of its own when it comes to teen science fiction novels.<br /> Throughout Ender's Game Orson Scott Card was able to make the character of Ender easily connected to and one of the ways he did this was through Enders fear of who he is and what he is becoming. This is a fear that many people, children and adults sometimes worry over and through this fear readers could easily connect with Ender. One of the times Ender showed his fear of himself was in the beginning of the book after he had badly injured a classmate of his who had been bullying him, \\"Ender leaned his head against the wall of the corridor and cried until the bus came. I am just like Peter. Take my monitor away, and I am just like Peter,\\" (Card 8). Peter was Enders older brother and very evil to everyone he felt was weaker than him and he couldn't get something from. Peter hated his brother, but has always been afraid of becoming like him, a feeling many can comply to.<br />The other way Orson made Ender so easy to be connected to was his style of writing the thought pattern of Ender. Unlike many other authors before him who gave young protagonist an innocent and baby like mind, Orson dared to make Ender a meticulous and cunning boy, even though he wasn't even 14 by the end of the book. Ender was a character that unlike those before him seemed more real and alike those young, intelligent children out there who faked their sweetness. This made Ender all the more real and easy to connect to. This can be best seen near the end of a fight scene near the middle of the book \\"Ender knew that at this moment he might be able to walk out of the room and end the battle. The way ha had escaped from the battleroom after drawing blood. But the battle would only be fought again. Again and again until the will to fight was finished. The only way to end things completely was to hurt Bonzo enough that his fear was stronger than his hate,\\" (Card 211). This cold, calculating and meticulous side of Ender was so truthful and dark that it reminded the reader that children are not really innocent. At least not today. They can be dark and controlling and ulterior reasons for everything. Even at first, this side of Ender doesn't seem right for a child, but readers who really think back to their childhood can remember moments when they thought like this, connecting them and Ender even more.<br />Ender's Game was beautifully written and gave a great insight into a dark world through the eye of a child. It didn't stop to try to tell a story about a boys mind like normally; rather it slashed through those norms and gave the true grit of who Ender was. Because of the way Orson wrote this story, readers are able to see a more truthful world and he's respected for that. With his writing style Orson seemed to connect Ender to everyone, giving him the definite right to win both the Hugo award and the Nebula. Orson Scott Card was able to write such a raw and powerful story that it needs to be bought, before the buggers get to it first!
