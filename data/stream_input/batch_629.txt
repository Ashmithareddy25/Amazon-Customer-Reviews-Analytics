B0000Z80HU|5.0|Okay, you already own the \\"Sea Change\\" CD. You love it and now you want to know if you should invest in the DVD Audio version. The answer to that question is a loud and resounding \\"YES!\\" It is an amazing experience to enjoy this album with 24 bit tracks through a surround sound system. After a single listen, I wondered how I listened to the original version all of these years. Indeed, the stereo version seems painfully inadequate compared to this full interpretation. When you hear this in a 5.1 environment, it sounds like this is how the album was always supposed to play. The surround sound audio was masterfully mixed. The sounds move around the room in a way that greatly enhances the telling of \\"Sea Change.\\" The screen images perfectly fit with the album's 'pink theme.' If hearing the LP in 5.1 wasn't enough, there are six videos. Granted, the videos are visually mediocre, but hey it's still Beck. The \\"Guero\\" collector's edition delivered the album in 5.1 but without any videos. This was done so well that it makes the fan wish for a DVD Audio translation of Beck's entire discography. Without a good home theater, the consumer will miss out on the primary benefit of this DVD Audio disc. That written, the LP can still be played in stereo. In addition, the videos can be watched on any DVD player. Played on the right system, the \\"Sea Change\\" DVD Audio disc is the ultimate Beck experience.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Sigur Ros's album simply titled \\"( )\\" is possibly the most other-worldly collection of sounds ever recorded and marketed as music. The Icelandic quartet has done something absolutely unique with this recording by sending every listener into a completely abstract world. The music is a collection of ambient atmospheric songs that unfold, build, climax and fade so naturally. It's genuinely hypnotising. The songs have no titles. The lyrics are in a language synthesized by the band called \\"hopelandic\\" that is essentially gibberish. No song titles, no real lyrics, hardly any liner notes to go by. Interpretation of the music is completely up to the listener. Any concrete element of music has been removed. All that remains is a wash of sound, color, emotion and texture that the listener can make what ever they want of it. I believe that this element has allowed Sigur Ros to become as internationally sucessful as they are. All language barriers, cultural barriers and musical barriers are completely torn down. I had a friend who played Sigur Ros for her friend from Africa that speaks little English and she was far more moved by it than any American artistic experience she had. This album is a pure masterpiece. Absolutely genius.

B000I5X80G|5.0|The whole CD is good, but what propels it to a 5-star rating are two magnificent tracks...the two tracks where Neil has extended guitar solos: Down by the River and Cowgirl in the Sand.  These two songs are above excellent and make the CD well worth purchasing.  If you have a choice to buy this CD with or without the DVD, buy the one without the DVD; as, in my opinion, the DVD is useless...just an audio of the music with still pictures.
0141187611|5.0|This is my favorite James Bond novel. Ian Fleming created a character with a gargantuan appetite for the more worldly pleasures. For a land that could supply our hero with such an appetite Fleming chose his own beloved Jamaica. The melding of the story with the setting is Fleming at his best. Jamaica was a land of beauty, mystery and intrigue. Fleming captured this so well and gave us a remarkable villain to reflect that esoteric quality of the island. The colour cover of Ursula Andress is like a haunting dream.
B000002H6C|5.0|This ranks, after Master of Puppets, as Metallicas greatest album. Crushing, brutal, cold, intelligent, and dowright epic. The production is also amazing, making the record sound as if it was recorded in a steel cube, and brings the concepts of the album, injustice, conformity, despair, and death, even more into focus. In 89 when this one was released I remember it being slightly overlooked and put fourth in the Metallica canon of greatness behind their three previous records, but no way. This one comes right after \\"Master\\" and is a much stronger album than Ride the Lightning and Kill Em All. I mean 18 years after its initial release and it still sounds incredibly fresh. A must have for any metal or hard rcok fan or just a fan of good and thought provoking music.
1933784032|5.0|To paraphrase animator/creature designer/puppeteer Phil Tippet, this book is about how several dozen people over the course of several decades managed to create an entire make-believe world (and the ships, creatures and environments within them) with their bare hands. <br /> <br />To a life-long Star Wars geek (and ILM/specialmeffects enthusiast in particular) like me, \\"Sculpting the Galaxy\\" is practically spaceship-porn, what with 216 pages filled with beautifiul macrophotography exploring every nook and cranny of the models created for the Star Wars universe in almost fetishistic detail. Don't take my word for it, either - the Millenium Falcon gets it's hown centerfold, fer chrissakes. <br /> <br />What's even better is that all of these photos are interspersed with anecdotes from the author and many other veterans of ILM's model shope describing how the design and fabrication of each model came to be (for example, the entry regarding the Death Star model from \\"A New Hope\\"s mentions that said model accidentally wound up being accidentally thrown away during ILM's move from San Raphael to Marin County). <br /> <br />Regardless, this book will stand as a testament to the talent and hard work of the craftsmen and artists who laboured so long to bring George Lucas's vision of a 'galaxy far, far way' to life. Kudos to you, fellas - you've definitely earned it.
B000FWAOVI|5.0|This is a fun book that I came across at a book fair and recognized as an old childhood favorite. The basic theme is that Grover keeps saying not to turn the page, and then humorously berates you when you do turn the page. So now my niece is getting a copy! If your kid likes Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus by Mo Willems, he or she will like this book too.
0553573403|5.0|if you're looking for something light and easy, this is not the book for you, but if you're looking for something deep and involving and mind-and-time-devouring, this is exactly what you need, because 'a game of thones' is all of these things. it is beautifully detailed, wonderfully characterized, incredibly unexpected, and many other adjectives as well. there are mounds of characters to follow, but each chapter belongs to one of them, giving them plenty of time to stretch and grow and change (that and the legnth of the book itself!), and they are all perfectly depicted as both good and bad, moral and immoral, making decisions and mistakes-- they're human, in a genre where the people are usually better then human. they grub around in the dirt, they hurt and are hurt, they get cold, they get sick, they damage eachothers' lives, they lie and they maneuver, they all play off against eachother. and even better, there's a rich and well-thought-out world behind them, a changing world with detailed histories and convoluted family ties and strong enemies on all sides. it's a world in flux, and that is perhaps the best part of it.<br /><br />if you like to be challenged by your reading material, go for this: martin assumes you're smart enough to keep up, and for that i, for one, am extremely greatful.
B000001I0K|5.0|Some of the band's more recent fans may not realize that this is an actual 2-on-1 CD reissue, of their very first effort, the five track EP 'Gravest Hits' ('79) with well done covers like Roy Orbison's &quot;Domino&quot;, Trashmen's &quot;Sufrin' Bird&quot; and the Ricky Nelson hit &quot;Lonesome Town&quot;. But first, you get the band's second full length lp, 'Psychedelic Jungle' ('81) with killer rockabilly pieces the Cramps themselves have totally mastered such as &quot;Goo Goo Muck&quot;, &quot;Rockin' Bones&quot;, &quot;Caveman&quot;, the catchy &quot;Don't Eat Stuff Off The Sidewalk&quot; and &quot;Green Door&quot;. An absolute must-have for any and all true Cramps fans. Get it! Look at that used price. A priceless work in music history, sort of.

B0000DCGT0|4.0|This is a very delightful film that is suitable for the whole family. True story of course, and very well told. Jeff Bridges, Tobey Maguire and Chris Cooper give shining performances. The story covers a lot of ground and therefore can get a little hard to understand at times, especially the beginning of the film. Once the groundwork has been laid, it gets pretty easy and will hold your attention all the way through. I personally had a little difficulty with the beginning. Once \\"Seabiscuit\\" comes into the movie, everything begins to click. Extroidinary acting by Maguire and even more so the young man who plays a very young Red Pollard before Maguire takes over the role. Very good cinematography, lush landscape, great sound technology. The DVD offers some good extras as well. A great film about second chances. I highly recommend it.
B00003CXCT|1.0|These are not the original theatrical realeases. In addition to the changes made in the special edition versions of the films, American Cinematographer noted in their review of the DVD release that they had gone so far as to change the color-timing of the transfer so that the color scheme more closely resembled the more recent prequels. Though they are an impressive technical achievement, I'll be buying the academy award winning films that I saw when I was younger.
B000001FSP|5.0|Marianne Faithful made her real stamp on the music world with this album 25 years ago.<br />with her characteristic raspy voice and angry and cynical lyrics she brought out such rock hits as the famous country-style Ballad of Lucy Jordan , the introspective Guilt , the protest song Broken English , the eerie Witches Song , the fast-paced rocker Brain Drain, her version of the John Lennon hit Working Class Hero and the expletive-filled song of fury at infidelity , Why D'ya Do It?.<br />A great synthesis of late 70's rock . If you love good rock with a sharp edge , you have to have this.
B00005JPC4|4.0|As a boy, Max (played by 'Finding Neverland's Freddie Highmore) spend his summers with Uncle Henry (Albert Finney) on his vineyard estate in France. Henry is a wine mentor and life lesson teacher to young Max, who eventually grows up to be a cold, no-nonsense stockbroker (Crowe) that hasn't had time for Henry in over 10 years. Max receives a telegram telling him that Henry passed away and although he had no will, the entire vineyard estate is being left to Max. Max has to travel to France, right after a taboo move he made in the stockmarket puts him under investigation. Once in France, he is reaquainted with the vineyard's overseer and his wife, and has a near accident with a gorgeous woman on a bicycle named Fanny (Marion Cotillard). Once Max gets to see and know Fanny, he becomes smitten. Add to this all the memories of summers with Henry that are triggered from seeing different areas of the grounds (the tennis court, a table with a dirty wine glass and one of Henry's old cigar butts still in the ashtray), and Max becomes more confused as to whether or not he really wants to sell the estate as originally planned. When Henry's illegitimate daughter shows up, more confusion is thrown into the mix. And of course, there's still the investigation business Max is under that his personal assitant Gemma (Archie Panjabi)continually calls him about, urging him to fly back home to sort out before he's in real trouble. Can Max sell his Uncle's legacy to the highest bidder and return to London, leaving behind the woman he finds \\"intoxicating\\"? What will happen to Henry's daughter Christy? And who knew a box of lavender will keep scorpions from entering through an open window?<br /><br />\\"A Good Year\\" is a wonderful story told by author Peter Mayle (\\"A Year in Provence\\") brought to life on the big screen. The scenery is gorgeous; the estate is in desperate needs of refurbishing and repairs, but even in it's rough state, you can see how lovely it is. Russell Crowe is fun to watch in this film, and Marion Cotillard is stunning; she reminds me quite a bit of Audrey Tatou. But my favourite character had to be Gemma. Rated PG-13 for language (couldn't tell if the 'F' word was spoken, because the french accent had me thrown), a short sexual scene (nothing is really shown), and brief nudity (we get a glimpse of Christy's bare bum when her back has to be examined for sunburn).tch in this film, and Marion Cotillard is stunning; she reminds me quite a bit of Audrey Tatou.

B0000024LN|5.0|This was the first Redman album I ever heard. When I heard it, I was impressed by his raw voice and unique flow. I think this should be the first Redman album that you listen to. That's because there are skits just like his earlier albums, mixed with newer lyrics, with cameos by Method Man, Erick Sermon, and everyone else. He is a lyrical genius!!! There are a lotta great one-liners all over the place! <br /> <br />One of my favorite hip-hop albums ever. Every single track is hot, and you'll be quoting the lyrics forever. <br /> <br />The skits are hilarious! Raw! Crazy! <br /> <br />...and rumor has it that he likes to smoke. <br /> <br />\\"Pick it up, Pick it up!!!!!!!!!\\"
B000GY729M|5.0|I dont know what the fuss is wether the fans will be accepting to The Killers new sound and look, I for one love it! By the 3rd time i heard the album, i knew there was no way i'd be able to stop listening to it for a very long time, just like Hot Fuss. The songs are great, the hooks are awesome and its so polished to perfection.
B000J103X4|4.0|I won't just give it 5 stars right now. Sure this album is a great follow-up to \\"The Documentary\\", but.... <br /> <br />He needs to quit comparing himself to every single great rapper!!! Just because he's dropped two great albums and a part of the over-hyped G-Unit vehicle, doesn't mean he's already IceCube-2Pac-Eazy-E-Nas all rolled in one. Dude, just prove it for the next decade like you promised in \\"The Documentary\\". Then I might believe you. <br /> <br />The Game is the only G-Unit rapper I like. 50 Cent thinks he's Tupac. Everyone else such as Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo etc. writes too many lyrics about Escalades and bling-bling. But Game just genuinely spits. His gritty voice combines with the great beats to make great albums.
B000J103X4|1.0|Everyone was extremely hyped about Doctor's Advocate. I mean after getting all of Game's mixtapes and promos and what not, we were really expected alot. What we got was a poorly produced, imature album that sounded like it came out of someone's garage. I mean there are 2 decent songs on the album, and they become old after the first day. It was just so dissapointing. Another issue here is the lyrical departure from the Documentary. Game's rhymes are border-line wack when compared to the verbal wizardry that you hear on The Documentary. The one thing this album showed is that 50 & Dre had everything to do with the success of Game's first album, and without them Game will never get close to the success he attained when he was a member of G-Unit.
B000I5X81K|4.0|I have been a fan of Josh Groban for a while now, and no I am a perfectly sound 18 year old- not an old lady like so many critics like to joke are Josh's only audience. His voice is amazing and addictive in my opinion, and it's refreshing to hear a man actually carry a note, unlike a lot of other male singers being so praised today whom really, without the studio helping them, have weak and thin voices. I prefer people who can truly sing and beautifully, and Josh was a great discovery.  <br /> <br />I loved Closer especially from him, so of course I compared Awake to it. It's hard to do that though I've come to realize, because Josh has taken a few different turns with this album. Some songs bring back the feel of Closer, such as Mai, the powerful opening to Awake. Yet then you hear Machine and Now or Never and you can tell Josh wanted to obviously expand. I think when a singer wants to expand is great, but you have to worry if you yourself personally will be into it.  <br /> <br />Some fans of Josh aren't into it, or it has to grow onto them. That's understandable for fans of anyone who is taking a new turn in their music. I myself though like a lot of the newer styles he has made. His voice is still the main reason of enjoyment- he could make almost any song sound moving I think. Yet the songs themselves in many places have their own strength as well. Machine is just wonderfully done I think, and So She Dances goes well along with Josh's singing, making a it a very romantic combination. Nonetheless, I will admit, Lullaby and Weeping are not favorites of mine. Again, Josh going in different styles is thumbs up, but most Josh fans I am sure are not going to like every song, due to not every style will not be a favorite. Weeping especially is not my style when it comes to Josh, although he does do it pretty well.  <br /> <br />1) Mai- 5/5 -A great opening, proving how amazing Josh's voice still is. <br />2) You Are Loved- 5/5 -Beautiful, uplifting lyrics and sung well. <br />3) Un Dia Llegara- 3.5/5 -Nice to listen to occassionally, but nothing too memorable. <br />4) February Song-5/5 -Gorgeous and soft, Josh takes your breath away on this song. <br />5) L'Ultima Notte- 4/5 -Just a very well- done song. <br />6) So She Dances- 5/5 -Josh paints beautiful pictures in this song...I just love the lyrics. <br />7) In Her Eyes- 4/5 -A strong track, but I think the song could have been even more powerful possibly, but still a great song nonetheless. <br />8) Solo Por Ti- 4.5/5 -Well sung, and I love the guitar in this song. <br />9) Now Or Never- 4/5- I really like how he does this song, it's different yet it still doesn't take away the feel of Josh.  <br />10) Un Giorno Per Noi- 4/5- Lovely song altogether. <br />11) Lullaby- 3/5 -It's a bit boring of a song, and too many people are in the song I think for me to enjoy Josh. <br />12) Weeping- 3/5 -As a song it is all right, Josh does everything right in the song but I just don't enjoy the song itself. I'm just not into this style. <br />13) Machine- 5/5 -I just love this song. Josh does everything right and it's one of his most fun songs. Definitely if I was to recommend Josh to anyone, this would be one of the songs I would have them listen to. <br /> <br />So overall there are a few tracks I listen to more than others, but my overall opinion of the album Awake is that Josh has decided to expand and has succeeded. I know fans of Josh whom just love Weeping, but aren't into Machine so obviously what doesn't work for some of Josh's fans on certain songs, works for other fans. Either way, Josh Groban's fans will not be overall disappointed for there are songs for every one of them on here. And who knows, the ones that may not suit us, like I with Weeping, may just be a grower. With Josh's voice, it is hard to resist any song he sings. <br /> <br />4.5/ 5
B000001ESF|5.0|1976's, \\"2112\\" album was a monumental moment in Rush's career.  It took the concept album idea that they experimented with on 1975's, \\"Caress of Steel\\" album, and took it to a new level, solidifying their sound for the remainder of the 70's.  <br />Basically, the story takes place in the year 2112 where mankind no longer knows music.  The main protagonist discovers a guitar and wants to re-introduce music to the world, much to the protest of the powers that be. <br />The album flows like a stream.  You can actually imagine the story unfolding, because the picture the band paints with the music is so vivid. <br />The story is far too complex for me to give a concise rundown of, but it is a mind-blowing listen. <br />The remainder of the album is 5 independent songs that cover a range of emotion.  \\"A Passage to Bangkok\\" simply rocks.  It just rocks.  But other songs like, \\"Tears\\" put forth a beautiful melancholy that you can just sit back and absorb.   <br />This is the album that got me into Rush and helped inspire me to play the bass.  All of the elements are there - Geddy's growling Rickenbacker,  Alex's wailing guitar solo's and Neil's virtuoso drumming make for a complex and intense listening experience. The art of the concept album was perfected in 1976 with this album.  Progressive rock fans - ingnore this at your peril!
B000IOM1RI|3.0|I am neither defending nor praising this album.  First of all I must say to those who do not like it all that much that this is just the soundtrack to the movie.  Creating lengthy songs for each track would not translate well to the movie.  But still (to almost sound as if I am agreeing with those same people) this album is way too short.  At just over 33 minutes I do feel a little cheated, but since it was only 10 bucks and it came with a free D shirt, I don't feel so bad about it.  A litte more vulgarity (meaning numerous f-bombs), references to songs from their debut and a rock off with Satan makes this soundtrack just good enough.
B000IOM1RI|3.0|Tenacious D's first album was peppered with sketch comedy routines, but in \\"The Pick of Destiny\\" Tenacious D eschews their signature sketch comedy in favor of a completely music-driven comedy album.  For some, this is a welcome change, but I thought that the non-musical \\"Inward Singing\\" and \\"Karate Schnitzel\\" were some of the best parts of their original album.  I understand that this is a soundtrack, but maybe they could have included more scenes from the movie to make up for the missing sketches.    What sets Tenacious D apart from other bands in the joke-rock genre is that, stylistically speaking, \\"The D\\" is actually a really good band.  Their musical style runs the gamut from classic 70's rock, to the arena rock of the 80's, to modern metal.
B000J103X4|5.0|With the sophomore attempt from The Game most would be interested to see if the statement of not needing the good doctor's help, be a believable one. Knowing the fact that he has no Dre beats what so ever, you may be thinking well it's just not going to be the same. Well that's correct, in a sense. The Game has selected and comprised this album of near to the sound production similar to that of Dr. Dre. With the production help from DJ Khalil, Will.I.Am, Just Blaze, Kanye West, Scott Storch, Hi-Tek etc. you'd be expecting some unbelievable work. Which is true. But The Game has in some sense taken a step back instead of forward. With the numerous referrals to Dr. Dre one would have to say YES he helped you get to where you are but you don't need to refer to him in every song or NO there's nothing wrong with that. The Game's creativity I feel was not at his fullest but his sheer mic presence makes up for that. With stand out tracks like \\"Why You Hate The Game\\", \\"Doctor's Advocate\\", \\"Let's Ride\\" & \\"One Night\\" any Hip Hop fan will have this in their collection.
B000J103X4|4.0|To be the greatest you must study the greatest and Dr. Dre should be very proud of his Compton brother.  This is a West Coast gem that surpasses his previous effort.  He's a better lyricist and I can see that this brother has a true love for the music.  In my opinion, this album is in the top ten best of the year.  J. Hova should take notice; this album is already giving Kingdom Come a run for its money.
B00005B1W5|5.0|I have owned the VHS tape for several years and now need to buy the DVD since my 22 month old son loves it so much and is wearing out the tape.  My husband started playing the tape for them to watch in the evenings  while I was deployed overseas with the military and now my son wants to watch it every night before he goes to bed.  He is mesmerized by watching the musicians and the vocalists and claps at the end of the songs.  I can't wait to take him to a Yanni concert when he gets a little older and have him see the musicians in action in person.  It makes me estatic that this concert video has introduced my son to the beauty of music at such a young age.
B000I5X81A|5.0|It makes sense that rock gods can get boring after 60. The hunger to make your mark isn't there anymore. The other side of that equation is these old guys have lived their way inside their music. They always have something to say that's worth hearing, they just need the right conditions to get 'em to say it.  <br /> <br />JJ inviting Clapton to record was a great idea. Eric has been working through his JJ obsession for many years, so how do they work together? <br />Beautifully. Both shine brighter on this album than they have in their solo work for quite some time. Clapton shows the emotional depth that only he can express on guitar and vocals on \\"Hard to Thrill\\" and \\"Who Am I Telling You\\". These are both superb, standout songs. JJ is all over the place, but he generously gives the album's crowning moments to Clapton and other guests.  <br /> <br />If that's Derek Trucks' solo on \\"Who Am I Telling You\\", it is a thing of beauty. Wow. And Albert Lee casually rips through a country solo that will leave you grinning like a 5 year old. Clapton and JJ play in and out of each other on every tune, mimicing each other's stylistic signatures until it's hard to tell who is playing. Anyone who loves guitar will have hours of fun figuring out who plays what lick.  <br /> <br />Whoever said the songs were dull is just wrong. Just abvout every song here is a laid back gem, esbecially \\"Who Am I Telling You\\", one of the most beautiful love songs JJ has ever written. Clapton's \\"Three Litle Girls\\" is also charming. This is a class album, so give it up for JJ and Eric, Albert, Derek, Billy, Taj, etc. Get 'em while you can folks, we won't see their like again.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Just remember, don't have high expectations and you'll be fine.<br /><br />I was so excited that this was the first thing I pulled out from the Ultimate Collection. Pressed play and completely missed Donner's Intro, which I saw on the end. And when I did, I swear he was getting emotional. I know I was.<br /><br />When you lose a family member for dead and 28 years later they turn up, you're just really so happy to have them back, it really doesn't matter whether they turned out well or not. Flaws or no flaws, they're family.<br /><br />That is my bottom line. No it didn't look like a patchwork of footage, in fact, it was rather quickly edited and snappier than Lester's II, I thought.  I greatly suggest one does NOT watch the Lester's before this to enjoy it more. Maybe watch STM first since this is exactly part II of it. Since I read David Michael Petrou's making-of-book backin 1978, I've looked forward to many of these scenes already and to finally see them, it's really a treat. My childhood being intact, my adulthood is fulfilled like finally getting the toy you never got but always wanted. Closure, although I'd love a fan edit, it isn't necessary for me, surprisingly.<br /><br />The music cuts throughout the film didn't bother me much, cutting from John Williams Score to Ken Thorne once in a while but the end credits really are jarring I must say, and poorly edited music. But John Williams nonetheless.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW:<br />It was a treat to see alternate takes of the recap. It's like meeting your best friend all over again when they were still young and innocent. I laughed out loud when Aaron Smolinski opened the ship to reveal his totally naked body and kid-acting a full body stretch. I remember again  having read somewhere that Reeve was said to have gotten &#34;mad&#34; at Donner because according to him, the kid had a tiny pee pee.<br /><br />I noticed my sound hookup was loose as the right channel wasn't working and the Soundwoofer was unplugged. I fiddled with it, reconnected everything and BOOM! the opening credits turned up and in six words...<br /><br />I had tears in my eyes...<br /><br />The Music was edited just like Superman Returns but I could tell this film really wanted to get started. Similar Credits to the original movie but CGI, and with William's Score not speeded up, it's truly wonderful.<br /><br />Opening view of Metropolis has a beautiful shot of the Twin Towers (and thank God!) the Planet establishing shot is an alternate take and not the same exact one in STM that Lester used, although it still has the same extras.<br /><br />I've seen the opening scene a few dozen times online but seeing it in widescreen is fantastic. Reeve's nuiances are delightful. When Lois says &#34;tall&#34;, Clark tilts a little, when she says &#34;broad-shouldered&#34; he hunches a little. When Perry says &#34;honeymoon&#34; he drops his jaw and a couple of times he does a &#34;don't do it, the people&#34; smile. What a delight to have it back.<br /><br />The Screen tests scene where they combine Reeve and Kidder's into one scene: Continuity aside, I still laughed out loud at the revelation. It's his reaction to her. They really had Chemistry even if they weren't in the same scene.<br /><br />The Lex/Jor-El Scene: What a delight! You see Brando popping in and out in clear images in all sizes. You also see as well, the three villains. I think, the whole idea was that an education crystal was a clear recording but when its Jor-El's spirit, it's the faded solarized one as shown in the original movie and in the dramatic scenes here.<br /><br />We get to see Lois kiss Superman here and vice versa and none of the Lester Amnesia Kiss. It was Creative Consultant Tom Mankewicsz idea that Clark should NEVER kiss Lois and I think he's right. This breakup scene on the North Pole seques into her balcony where they part ways. Both scenes are practically different takes from the extended version shown on TV.  And like the dvd collection trailer, Lois delivers &#34;your secret's safe with me&#34; with so much sincerity and innocence, it really sounds &#34;like a little girl quivering.&#34; I admit I had tears in my eyes.<br /><br />The Powering scene. Reeve's acting looked raw but it didn't matter to me, I also had tears.<br /><br />Turning back time worked for me, effects notwithstanding.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This movie is a complex journey into the minds of the Wachowski brothers and how they have got the knowhow to put trilogy depth into one single movie. They have this movie so multilayered, that half the movie, V is talking through the other characters and since the whole movie is one idea, it turns out to be possibly the most wholesome movie I've ever seen! From beginning to end, its poses many questions and lets you create the answers within your own mind. Everytime I watch this movie, I find something new and Natalie Portman plays the part perfect... puts me in tears. It takes a couple time of watching it for it really to kick in. Very well made flick. Amaaaaaazing!!!~
B000IOM1RI|5.0|For anyone who isn't previously versed in the D, this CD may be a little off-putting. Especially those who like the single Pick of Destiny that is all over MTV. But being a fan of the D for a long time, I rather enjoy this disc. My only problem with Tenacious D has been that they didn't have enough music on their first CD. This problem is solved on the soundtrack to their movie that opens next week. One thing I've always thought is that when they really want to be, Tenacious D are an excellent band. Kyle and Jack can harmonize easily and Jack is quite the frontman, who can also sing when he wants to. The lyrics are goofy and crass but it's the magic of the D. The musicianship of the band is excellent as I have said before, Kyle is a solid guitar player and their drummer is the multi-talented Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters). Certain songs I really enjoyed are \\"Kickapoo\\" which features both Meatloaf and Ronnie James Dio. Other good songs are History (which is from their TV show, which are included on the Tenacious D Masterworks, which I would also suggest for D fans), Master Exploder and Beezleboss, which is pretty metal, even for the D. So if you want to hear some good rock music with the appeal of Jack Black and stilly humor, join the ever growing fans of the D immediately!

B0002S947K|5.0|This CD amazes me every time I listen to it - it simply never wears me down. It's incredibly versatile. No matter what mood I'm in, it works. Lamontagne's voice is beautiful. One listen, and you're hooked.
B000HCO83Q|1.0|The first X-Men movie was fantastic. The second movie sent chills down my spine and was even better. This third movie was absolute trash and I will never buy it.
B0000019PA|5.0|This album like everyone has said is a masterpiece.  Jeff Mangum's nasal whine is not your typical singer's voice, but it grows on you incredibly fast.  The guitar chords are simple but always convey the proper emotion and the lyrics, I must stress, are anything but nonsensical.  They are incredibly deep and full of a fresh take on love and the struggles of life and death.   <br />     The album was inspired by a reading of the Anne Frank story, and it is easy to detect pieces of the story filtering through, especially in the songs Holland 1945 and Oh Comely, which is a masterpiece in and of itself.  The emotion in this album is unparalelled.  It is sparse yet powerful.  And also, the lyrics are not nonsensical.  They are complex and figurative, but after struggling with them for enough listens, they begin to make sense.  Mangum's voice is so perfectly suited for this music because, frankly, the lyrics would sound very emo if your typical pop singer were singing them.  Give it a chance.  It may require multiple listens, but the rewards are well worth it.

0143034901|5.0|This is that same rare, wonderful sort of book as Elizabeth Kostova's \\"The Historian\\": a story that wraps mystery, love, terror, growing up and a love of literature all into one hell of a read.  Shadow of the Wind is a work of art--a heartrending mystery written with feeling and grace.  The threads of the tale are so artfully woven together that all you can do is sit back and let Zafon's silver tongue guide you through one awesome book.<br /><br />Set in post-WWII Barcelona, Zafon gives the reader a luscious and affectionate portrait of the city.  Shadow of the Wind centers around the teenage years of Daniel Sempere, a bookseller's son who becomes obsessed with the mysterious author of a book called \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\".  As the book's de facto guardian, Daniel decides to investigate the dark and tragic past of Julian Carax, the book's author.  When Daniel Sempere finds that he is not the only one interested in Carax and his stories, his quest for information delves deeper and deeper into the history of the shadowy figure that draws in everyone who encounters him.<br /><br />I stayed up until four o'clock in the morning reading this book--that's how good it is.  If you are reading this right now, I'm serious: BUY THIS BOOK.  I promise you won't regret it.
B000IOM1RI|4.0|Folks, maybe you're missing the point of what this is: a soundtrack to a comedy movie. These tracks are absolutely perfect for a Tenacious D release. Excellent, solid rock (touched with tasteful mock metal) spans the whole album, and Kyle shows off his chops (listen to his riffage on 'The Metal') and Jables continues to deliver solid, unique comedy and a knack for touching the boundaries of a \\"real\\" band vocalist. Grohl fits perfectly in his role behind the drums, and these songs deserve recognition for what they are: well-polished comedy tracks smart enough to satisfy discerning long-time fans (would have liked a studio 'Sasquatch', though, that's for sure) as well as casual fans who love comedy and music.
0316172324|4.0|Gladwell did surprise us with a lot of hard facts about how certain people possess the ability to \\"do the things right\\" without even thinking. An interesting read, but unfortunately lacks of a central belief in his book.  After reading, you just have this difficulty to conclude the lesson learned here!  <br /> <br />It reminds me of another book, \\"From Lowbrow to Nobrow\\" (Peter Swirski, 2006) which is with an enjoyable writing style and a strong point to support the writer's keen observations and insights to fulfill your apetitie of learning.  It clearly depicts the unique phenomenon of the popular culture of today.  I personally highly recommend you to take a look at this book as it is a book of thinking power!   <br />
B000FJGWBC|3.0|Jared (Paul Walker) works as a scuba teacher but dreams of being a treasure hunter who finds a gold-laden shipwreck.  His girlfriend Sam (Jessica Alba) supports him in all that he does and truly loves him.  When Jared's brother Bryce (Scott Caan) shows up with a new girlfriend Amanda (Ashley Scott) luck seems to go their way.  They have access to a boat and have found a few scattered remnants of a wreck that might be the pirate ship that's supposed to be the mother lode of treasure ships.  Unfortunately, a plane with cocaine has crashed into the ocean nearby and complicates the situation when the drug runners come looking for their lost product.  Further trouble happens as everyone argue how best to proceed with the search for the treasure ship, and what to do about the cocaine.<br /><br />John Stockwell directed the movie and does an amazing job of shooting eye-catching imagery that's stunning on the Blu-ray presentation.  I found myself getting sidetracked more than once by the seascape captured in the camera lens, and the fact that I noticed it at all while Jessica Alba was swimming around in a bikini is saying a lot.  The audio portion of the movie is packaged uncompressed, allowing the film to take full advantage of a surround sound system and throughly wow the audiophile.<br /><br />Although INTO THE BLUE doesn't go anywhere spectacular for the experienced moviegoer (films like THE DEEP and A SIMPLE PLAN offer similar plot lines and conflict), it does deliver a very watchable story.  The added bonus of the incredible underwater imagery and the impeccable sound system is worth getting the movie in Blu-ray if you don't already have it on DVD.<br /><br />As a thriller, INTO THE BLUE works.  And it's a great buddy flick.  Not exactly date material, but if you're with someone who likes action and tension, this will fit the bill nicely.
B00005OM5L|5.0|This is definitely the best solo Clapton DVD available.  The best one for my money would be the Cream Live At the Royal Albert Hall Reunion Concert.  The Live At Hyde Park DVD has amazing performances from Clapton and the band.  Clapton is one of my favorite guitarists and his guitar work here is fantastic.  The concert was filmed extremely well with plenty closeups of Eric playing the guitar.  His guitar work throughout the concert is extraordinary.  Having a live performance of \\"I Shot The Sheriff\\" with a guitar solo from EC is awesome and other highlights include \\"Five Long Years,\\" \\"Badge,\\" \\"White Room,\\" \\"Have You Ever Loved A Woman,\\" \\"I'm Tore Down,\\" \\"Old Love,\\" and \\"It Hurts Me Too.\\"  Eric and the band give incredible performances for every song, and EC's guitar playing is unbelieveable.  I highly recommend this DVD to any Clapton fans or to anyone who is a fan of guitar music.  This DVD and the Cream DVD mentioned above are the ultimate Clapton DVDs.
B00000099Y|5.0|THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD.  <br />I LOVE THIS ALBUM... That's it
0307341542|1.0|I mean, really.  SHARP OBJECTS has gotten tons of media coverage and nary a negative review in sight.  I usually read hundreds of novels a year, and I really don't get the big deal about this novel at all.<br /><br />This book contains some sharply written prose, but the mystery plotline is quite weak.  SHARP OBJECTS is essentially a literary novel that the publisher has labeled a \\"mystery\\" to push more copies on unsuspecting consumers.  This slow-paced novel is not much of a whodunit and contains almost no suspense.  This novel does have a big plot twist near the end, but I found it to be implausable and pointless, tacked on for shock value and nothing more.<br /><br />My major problem with this novel is the characters.  All of the major players in SHARP OBJECTS are cartoonishly nasty and dysfunctional.  Most of the characters are the residents of a small town in Missouri, and Gillian Flynn seems to have nothing but contempt for most of them.  The heroine of this book is an introspective bore, and possesses little personality beyond her self-destructive behavior.  I didn't like or identify with anyone in SHARP OBJECTS, which for me is a fatal problem with any novel.  I found this book tough to finish.<br /><br />As Stephen King notes in his blurb, this is a nasty little novel.  The main question is whether you want to waste your time and money on something like this.  In the end, I regretted doing so.
B0002IQHY8|1.0|I read many reviews of \\"A Valid Path\\" and was relieved to find that my opinion of this \\"work\\" was shared by many others.  When I heard about this CD I thought it was going to sound great, like the beginning of Pyramid (Voyager) or \\"Sirius\\" from Eye in the Sky.  I listened to this on my CD at work and couldn't believe how terrible it sounded.  One of my co-workers liked it though and gave me $10 for it.  I felt guilty and tried to give him $5 of it back.  I can't comprehend how anyone who has enjoyed his music from the start could like this.  I'm hoping Parsons will come up with something mind expanding like he used to next time.  I even gave this CD more than one chance and still didn't like it enough to keep it.  Some of the melodies are good but the background sounds are so monotous and some are just plain weird sounding.  I know this review will get many not helpful ratings but if you believe them instead of me and get this anyway and share my opinion don't say you weren't forewarned.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I adore this series. Wonderful cast, great writing, and superb execution . . .this series is brilliant! I fell in love with the characters and plots. Lovely use of wit - I usually find at least one memorable quotation in every episode!    It's Star Wars meets Bonanza - and I am of fan of neither. I was skeptical when my husband brought this series home for us to watch together. I am so glad he did! We now have the same favorite movie!

B000G759LW|4.0|It's shameful but must admit for a long time Miss Aguilera wasn't even on my radar screen but over the years her unmistakable voice has become to prevalent to ignore. Once I got hip I have to say that I have been impressed ever since. This is a classic example of a young woman taking charge of her image, career, and destiny. Interestingly enough, there is no appearance from Black Eyed Peas' will.i.am, who seems to pop up everywhere these days, but thats not a bad thing. See, in is absence, Christina has sought the powers of Gangstarr's DJ Premier (found on the intro 'Back to Basics', 'Back in the Day', 'Ain't No Other Man', 'Still Dirrty', and the fan appreciative dedication 'Thank You'), who is in top form here. This time out she has fused Hip-Hop with Pop with a liberal sprinkling of soul. This is a bona-fide hit and a nice addition to the collections of fans and newcomers alike.
B00062ZE44|5.0|If you liked Evanescence's album \\"Fallen\\", then you will probably like this album. Good rock beats combined with soaring, operatic vocals to make a musical experience that I never get tired of listening to.
B00029QWII|3.0|For me, watching this movie was one of the most painful experiences I have had to endure at the screen.  The excesses of blood and gore and violence remind me of the excesses of the medieval period in representing and imitating the 'passion of Christ.'   <br /> <br />Theologically and historically, the film is quite accurate (in terms of the Gospel accounts) except for the gory detail of the suffering of Christ.  Unfortunately the Jews are depicted in quite negative terms, which does not help heal the rift between Judaism and Christianity, caused by centuries of Christian demonising of the Jews for killing God.  But the biggest repellant for me is the violence, which seems to suggest we only achieve redemption only through a very bloody human sacrifice to an angry God; something which doesn't seem in accordance with much of the theology I know.   <br /> <br />While there is no 'easy Jesus' or 'cheap grace', I believe Gibson has gone way overboard in this film with the blood and gore, which tends to obscure rather than show the love of God shown through the sacrifice of Christ.  Indeed, Jesus seems to be in so much pain for half of the time it hardly seems like divine love or the Father's will is on his mind, but sheer agony from the extreme torture.   <br /> <br />This film is certainly to be avoided for younger children and adults, and anyone watching it should be warned.
B000I5X80G|5.0|Any review of this CD should be of \\"what it is\\", instead of \\"what it could be\\". And, \\"what it is\\" is phenomenal. There are delightful versions of \\"Wonderin'\\" and \\"Winterlong\\" that I was hungry to hear and was not disappointed. Wonderin' appears on the album \\"Everbody's Rockin'\\", a disappointing NY effort, however this live version does the song justice and is a great example of early Crazy Horse. Winterlong was on \\"Decade\\", but, as in the case of Wonderin', I believe the live version is better. <br /> <br />There was also negative talk during the days before the CD's release about \\"C'mon Baby Let's Go Downtown\\", most saying it would be the same version as on \\"Tonight's the Night\\". Young silenced the naysayers by placing a slightly different version on \\"Fillmore\\" (most people forget that the 1970 concert was for 2 engagements, so there were 2 versions to choose from) <br /> <br />\\"Everybody Knows this is Nowhere\\" is a steady Crazy Horse entry, no complaints here, and others have dissected \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" and \\"Down by the River\\", and I have nothing to add. <br /> <br />Conclusion: quit fussing over the songs Neil left out, and enjoy the songs he included. You really didn't think he would shoot the works in the first NYA release, did ya? Innaresting.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|Overall in my view this is the best season of Enterprise.  While the focus is basically on the 'Xindi Arc', overall the Xindi theme is well executed from start to finish with few flaws.  It is by far the darkest part of the series (much as the Dominion War arc was the darkest part in DS9) but the hardship and life and death situations the crew face lead to the most interesting exploration of the psyches of the main characters, their sometimes dubious actions and choices (such as Archer's torture of an alien to find out more about the Xindi and stealing a warp coil from a neutral ship after the Enterprise is attacked and crippled) in the face of extreme situations.   <br /> <br />Other interesting aspects of the series are neglected, such as the development of the relationships between the various Star Trek races, though these are explored in some detail in the Fourth Season.   <br /> <br />I think the end of this series was spoiled somewhat by the 'Nazi' Arc (overall this addition to the Xindi Arc to conclude the Temporal Cold War wasn't well written or executed, or that convincing) but generally, it was very well done and acted.
0618680004|5.0|Just read this book and decide.  Richard Dawkins sheds some light on some very complex ideas.  Reading \\"The God Delusion\\" is more enlightening and lucid than reading the prose in the Holy Bible especially the King James Version with its difficult to understand 1611 English.  The updated translations (NIV, NRSV, ESV, etc.) of the Bible are easier to read but still have bizzare stories and lots of verses that contradict one another.  Christian friends of mine have explained these logical contradictions in the Bible.  Unfortunately, their explanations of the contradictions are vastly more confusing than the logical contradictions themselves (at least to me, anyway).   <br /> <br />I am happy that the media in my country (USA) is promoting (or at least mentioning) books such as \\"The God Delusion\\" by Richard Dawkins, \\"Letter to a Christian Nation\\" by Sam Harris, and \\"Breaking the Spell\\" by Daniel Dennett.  We need an open and honest national (or world) discussion about religion and atheism.   <br /> <br />By the way, a good Christian friend of mine from China read \\"Letter to a Christian Nation\\" by Sam Harris(less than 100 pages).  He is still a Christian and can't give up God; however, he is more understanding and tolerant of atheism.  This Christian even complimented Harris on how clearly he conveys his points in his writing.
B000E41MS6|4.0|I used to be strangely fascinated with Dr Who in my younger days.  His explorations of weird planets and his encounters with bizarre creatures and enemies, from the daleks and cybermen to hostile algae and pool machines, were strangely captivating (despite the tacky special effects).  Still, the series deserved its place as a classic.   <br /> <br />For a while, Dr Who went quiet.  There was one telemovie but no series.  The BBC handed the task to Russel T. Davies, the writer who created the telemovie 'The Second Coming.'  Christopher Eccleston was chosen for the role of the doctor, while Billie Piper (a very pretty pop singer with a strong accent) was chosen to be his companion.   <br /> <br />The new series was made in 2005 and shown in several countries.  We are reintroduced to some old enemies (the daleks) and also some new ones.  We also learn some new things about what happens to humanity in the future, and also some things about our past. <br /> <br />Overall the new series is much more faster paced than the classical series have been.  The first reason appears to be that instead of five episode stories which slowly lead up to their conclusion, a story is usually self contained in a single episode.  The new series tends to have far more action and less 'cerebral' meditation on arcane science fiction ideas, perhaps because Davies wanted to appeal to a younger audience with a shorter attention span.   <br /> <br />The weakness of the new series is that some of the stories seem to lead nowhere, are executed too quickly, and at times the emotional interaction between Rose (Billie Piper) and those around her gets too sentimental at times.  Still, I have generally enjoyed the format of the new series, as well as the ideas and the reappearance of old enemies.
0740748475|2.0|Calvin & Hobbes is far and away the best comic strip ever, and I looked forward to getting this set for quite some time. If it weren't for the problems described below, I'd give this set 5 stars. But, I have several issues with the production quality: <br /> <br />1) The \\"removable\\" goop they stick the top label on (under the shrink wrap) stuck to the fabric-like covering on the slip-case and left a spot that won't come off. <br /> <br />2) The books fit very tight in the case, and when I pulled the first one out, the covering of the case was caught on the corner of the book and pulled loose. There was no way to get it out without that happening. It also came loose in other places. This is unacceptable, as it caused permanent damage. <br /> <br />3) The corner of the slip-case was crumpled, even though it was packaged very tightly. This was the fault of the shipper, as it had clearly been dropped. But, one of the books had damaged pages (corners slightly dented and folded over). This couldn't be blamed on the shipper, as it was inside the shrink wrap. <br /> <br />I think I will be sending this set back to be exchanged or refunded.
0060934913|4.0|I was pointed to this book by a Food Network fan who loves food and thought this was a great story about how people become chefs, why they are passionate about cooking and good food and why the lives of chefs are so interesting. I would certainly agree that the book was entertaining--it was funny and moved along very well, plus I did learn a lot about the restaurant business and what I should look for when I am eating out. It was informative and a good read, so certainly worth reading for people who love cooking and chefs, but also great for people like me who just enjoy a good story that is well told--nothing complicated or too deep, but certainly a good bedside book.  <br /> <br />My one complaint about the book is that Bourdain makes all of the characters alpha-male (or female), profane and hard living carcitures, which makes them seem a little unrealistic and not at all memorable, but in the end the book overcomes that flaw and is still very worth checking out.
0767824571|5.0|\\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" would have to rank as one of Python's high points and came to be almost an icon of the group's zany humour. My first viewing of the movie left me at once choking for oxygen and impressed by some of the subtle angles they took. Admittedly, not that much was all that subtle in the end.<br /><br />Containing great scenes that still endure as massively quotable, (even non-Python fans have heard of them), this is definitely a must-have for anyone remotely interested in the work of Monty Python. The black knight at the bridge is still one of the funniest things I have seen, (I still kill myself laughing at it). The \\"anarcho-syndicalist\\" serfs, (\\"You can't expect to weild supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!\\" -- Dennis to King Arthur), were just a treat. Overall, it is a good whipping at anything concerning King Arthur and a host of other tales from the medieval period.<br /><br />Simply put, this is among the best that Monty Python have done, and after over 30 years, it is still up there with the best comedy on the planet. I loved it back then, and I still love it now. An enduring classic that never bores. Great stuff that definitely needs oxygen and defibrillation units.
B000IOM1RI|4.0|And thats just what it is, a soundtrack.  If you're buying this CD expecting a full blown album comparable to the D's first CD, you will most likely be disappointed.<br /><br />While listening to this album I couldn't help but feel that the songs were void of the same glory and rockingness that the first album had.  I really don't feel that anything in the soundtrack is comparable to the D's actual music, and its obvious that this is, after all, just a soundtrack to a movie and not an actual album.<br /><br />Fun yes, but I hope that Jack and Kyle decide to release a true second album sometime in the future.
0800141660|5.0|Even though this time period is not very fair to women; and even though in translation to film, the story lost some of its most interesting themes; I have to say that it's one of my favorite movies of all time.  The casting is perfect--Hugh Grant is spot-on for the stuttering, awkward Edward Ferrars, Harriet Walter is fantastically despicable as Fanny Dashwood, Elizabeth Spriggs cracks me up as Mrs. Jennings every. single. time.  And I SO have a crush on Alan Rickman.<br /><br />I feel like the screenplay really effectively captures the excruciating reservedness of socializing in that period--when Edward and Elinor have to carry on polite conversation, neither one betraying their feelings, the silences are painful.  And I love the scene at the ball when Elinor has to chat with Robert Ferrars as they dance--she's careful to do the right conversational \\"steps\\" without neglecting the societal \\"rhythm\\".<br /><br />Brilliant.

630529142X|5.0|I am not a big Adam Sandler fan. I find most of his movies to be a little bit on the boring side but for some bizarre reason, I absolutely love this movie. Maybe because it's just bizarre.<br /><br />Adam Sandler plays Bobby Boucher (pronounced Bo-shay). He's not exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer, he's in his thirties, he's a momma's boy, and he makes his career as being a professional water boy. Water is his life. Sandler created a very interesting character in Bobby Boucher.<br /><br />He goes to work for the Louisiana Mud Dogs where the Coach, played by Henry Winkler discovers a \\"hidden talent\\" in Bobby. When Bobby gets angry, he has the strength of twenty men so the coach makes Bobby a defensive tackler with the Bobby's condition that nobody tell his momma.<br /><br />In college Bobby learns that alligators are aggressive not because they \\"have all these teeth and no toothbrush\\" but because of the way their medulla oblongata is geared. He learns to have friends' outside of his momma. In other words, Bobby is growing up which is his momma's biggest fear because she is afraid that once he grows up, he won't need her, any more.<br /><br />It's actually a very sweet movie. What I really liked about this movie were the visualization scenes. The Coach has Bobby visualize his opposition as people who have made him angry in the past. There is this one scene where he sees the whole offensive line with Henry Winklers head on their shoulders singing, \\"Water sucks...it really, really sucks...\\"<br /><br />You have to see it...it's hysterical.<br /><br />For the most part I review spiritual/metaphysical/philosophical books and movies, but I love films like this even though they may appear to have no \\"redeemable\\" aspects. Which is not true. I can find meaning and depth in everything. I'm not saying that The waterboy is a major philosophical triumph, but it does have meaning and depth even though it's primarily silly and highly bizarre...which is also good!<br /><br />I love this movie and even though I do not own this DVD, I do watch it every time it's on television. It does generate some hardy laughs and I appreciate it just for that!<br /><br />Peace & Blessings.I do watch it every time it's on television.

0192804782|3.0|I tried very hard all through high school and college to be a Jane Austen fan.  I could never get fully engrossed in one of her books and thus assumed that the writing style just didn't appeal to me.  But once I tackled Sense and Sensibility, I found that Austen could engage me after all.  I love Austen's structuring of this book--the contrast of the Dashwood women and the subtle caricatures presented in their surrounding families.  And I thought the plot was plenty dramatic enough to carry me through to the final page.  I finished it in three days.

You have to piece together what happened for yourself, rather than being beaten over the head with it.<br /><br />I love that there is a servant in every scene. It perfectly captures the trust the \\"upstairs\\" people have in the \\"downstairs\\" folk, and shows that one who gets the story from servants is very well-informed indeed.<br /><br />I have been known to watch this film, start-to-finish, three times in a row.
B000IOM1RI|5.0|Some great new songs, but as mentioned this is a soundtrack so don't expect it to be of the same caliber as their first CD. There are some really great songs on here including History (which I never understood why it wasn't on their first as it is one of their older songs). But also some first rate newer songs such as Kickapoo, The Government Totally Sucks, Master Exploder, and my current favorite Beelzeboss. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that the CD is too short...they should have at least filled it out more with some dialog from the movie...but it's enough to keep me happy till their next CD.
0618680004|1.0|-My Baloney Detector has become tired of hearing fundamentalist atheists pontificating how religion is invariably deluded and destructive while atheism is the opposite.  Perhaps the author means well, but here's why \\"Delusion\\" is so, well, deluded:<br /><br />--First, its knee-jerk abhorrence for non-fundamentalist atheists ranges from derision (for Gould) to loathing (for Mother Theresa. The author's hatred for this profoundly decent woman clearly shows the quality of his moral compass).  \\"Delusion\\" never explains how the outcome of its vision would differ from any other authoritarianism, or how something positive should arise from its essential hatefulness. A bullying hucksterism pervades its character. As Russell observed about Marxism, a path without heart is not to be trusted.<br /><br />--\\"Delusion's\\" solution is terrifying. Decent atheism is part of a healthily diverse society, but fundamentalist atheism has been a dangerous idea indeed. Far from being a warm, sophisticated alternative to religion, fundamentalist atheism has proven an epic human disaster.  Its materialism alone is destructive and uncompassionate.  The author asserts no one ever killed in the name of atheism, which is deceptive, because tens of millions have been coldly and consistently murdered and abused by communist atheism from Lenin to the Kims, and atheism is as fundamental to communist ideology as religion is to Al-Qaida.  Atheists often whitewash or ignore communism's fundamental atheism, at the cost of moral and intellectual integrity, and \\"Delusion\\" follows this path.  \\"Delusion\\" then implies scientism is the solution; this is clearly falsified by examples such as Heisenberg and Lorenz (brilliant Nobelists who strongly supported Nazism) and by eugenics and biological weapons (which show that even good science, like good religion, can be dangerously misappropriated).<br /><br />--\\"Delusion\\" remains unconvincing.  The fact is ... the author doesn't know, either.  The answer is well outside his credentials package. \\"Delusion's\\" dogmatism shows that bad dogmas, like bad data, are worse than none.  The descriptions of God reminded me of elementary school, but the book's fundamentalist atheist quest remains an interminable and unverifiable waste of time, fundamentalist atheism remains morally vacuous and untrustable, atheists hardly monopolize intelligence or courage, legitimate spiritual insight retains its positive value, etc.  The author brags his associates are mostly atheist (as if truth were some politically-correct academic popularity contest), but ignores the abundance of non-atheists in science (especially medicine).  \\"Delusion's\\" discussions of modern theology, non-theistic religions, the well-lived life, etc. are painfully shallow.  Its memory is selective; for example, it claims Hitler was not atheist, but ignores how Nazism is more the spawn of Nietzsche's atheism than of religion (indeed, \\"Delusion\\" eerily reflects Nietzsche's supremacist attitude).  \\"Delusion\\" is a good example of atheist fundamentalism, but hardly a proof of fundamentalist atheist superiority.<br /><br />--Finally, science doesn't need \\"Delusion.\\"  Its arrogant rhetoric may further damage science's public support (and \\"Delusion\\" is not science, it's a polemic).  \\"Delusion\\" appears eager to lead science itself down a mean-spirited detour completely in conflict with science's open mind.

B000IFQLLY|4.0|While there are other singles compilations, this is the only one to truly encompass their entire career.  Most of the selections are dead on, for a \\"volume 1\\" it's to be expected that some songs would be missing.  Surprisingly, there aren't any Martin Gore sang songs on this disc.  Also, nothing from Black Celebration.      I think they could have swapped Leave In Silence for See You and made this compilation better, as LIS is the better song from A Broken Frame.  I probably would have put in Condemnation rather than I Feel You here as it is truly one of their best songs ever.  Dave's voice was so harsh at the time from the lifestyle he was leading, and his voice and the song go together to create a truly amazing moment in time.  That said, the album needs a Martin Gore vocal on this disc, and while Home is probably their biggest hit with Martin singing, it would have been great had they dug out one of the live versions of Condemnation when Martin sang it (due to Dave's voice being shot at the time.)  That would have made this a true \\"must have\\" for D-Mode fans.      As it is, it's nice to have this album to listen to when we don't have access to our MP3 players or multidisc cd/dvd players.  It replaced Tool's 10,000 Days in my car, which in turn replaced Playing the Angel in my puter's CD Rom drive.  Yes, I have them in MP3s, but sometimes you just want to hear the album as an album.  And if that is the case for you as well, then this is a great album to get.      Give it to your niece, nephew, cousin, child or step-child and let this be their introduction to one of the longest lasting yet still relevant bands around.  As for you, longtime D-Mode fan, puts this somewhere where you'll always be able to hear it at a moments notice, and take a trip through a great career that seems to have refound its footing and is dug in for the long haul.
B000FQ4M58|3.0|A quick review here, since others have commented well on a bunch of it. I love the voice and the lyrics are pretty clever (like similar Steinman stuff.) What misses for me is that the songs seem out of order... the opening track (Monster's Loose) sets me up for a rock epic, but the album loses steam a few tracks in, and then it's a pop album with several 3 to 4 minute tunes in the middle (which are good, too, btw.) I wonder why the album didn't open with \\"I'm Still Alive\\" and then intermixed the tunes with over-produced epics. Consequently I find myself skipping through songs on my iPod, and skipping \\"Cry Over Me\\" completely because it's just annoying.
B000059QYB|5.0|Most of us love Billy Idol's tunes. Most of us will see the tracklisting and will find it absolutely perfect. I would include myself in that majority, since practically everything a fan might need is there.  <br /> <br />Aside from \\"Blue Highway,\\" I don't think that there are any glaring omissions on here. The live track is okay, but Idol is a hell of a showman; this track doesn't do justice to his onstage persona. And the Simple Minds cover is okay, but it's not a terrible improvement on the original. <br /> <br />But those are minor quibbles. This compilation is nothing but quality hit after hit. An icon's best works have been placed together in this set, and an excellent collection has thus been created. The tracks are all classics and hold up, even today. If you're a fan of Idol and his output, this compilation totally deserves a place in your collection.
B000HEWEE4|1.0|I usually trust Amazon reviewers on movie reviews, but this time ....NO WAY!   This silly, totally predictable film left us playing with the cat for our evening entertainment, hoping the movie would liven up.  Sadly, it didn't. To those who rave about the film...you must be in another dimension or something.  Thumbs DOWN.
B000002MTR|4.0|Ragging on this album just because of Dave Navarro's presence is unwarranted. Face it: The Chili Peppers have seen various different guitarists in their albums, and each compliments Flea's bass and Kiedis' vocals in a suitable manner. Navarro just happened to be heavier. <br /> <br />This album IS, in my a opinion, a strange detour from the line of continuity that the Chili Peppers had been following. The first album was patchy funk affair nurtured under the hollow production imposed by GoF's Andy Gill. The second album saw a lazy, fun sort of funk come to the fore under the auspices of George Clinton. With \\"The Uplift Mofo Party Plan,\\" there was a move towards trebly funk rock. 1989's \\"Mother's Milk\\" was a great blend of powerful funk rhythms and massive guitar overdubs. The sound was rather balanced by the sheer intensity of it all, and the production made it all enjoyable. The next album, \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik,\\" brough the production back to a more stable level. It was here where the care-free funk and the unique guitar work were allowed to flourish in their own manner. And the results were great. <br /> <br />But \\"One Hot Minute\\" sees the production values take an abrupt dark shift. The general atmosphere of the album is one of hazy psychedelia meshed with overly dark sensibilities. Songs like Warped, Deep Kick and the title track best exhibit this foray into the dark side. The psychedelia comes to the fore on both the funky numbers (Walkabout, Falling into Grace) and poppier tracks like Airplane. Both of these types of songs inhabit a barely lucid realm that's totally different from the band-in-a-room sound on the previous album. Sometimes, the darkness and the psych can both manifest themselves within the confines of a particular song. All of this can be rather unsettling for those accustomed to a funky, happy-go-lucky sort of juvenile sound. <br /> <br />The songs themselves are much more difficult to swallow than the tracks on previous albums. Those albumshad a lot of filler and throwaway tracks, while all of BSSM could be enjoyably absorbed in a single sitting. With \\"One Hot Minute,\\" however, the overbearing heavyness makes it hard to listen to the album over and over. Navarro's guitar sound is just too heavy in many ways, and it drowns our Flea's characteristic bass in many instances. The vocals on the tracks rely more on attitude than content (as always with Kiedis), but there's a certain straightforward approach here that stands in contrast with the more playful mannerisms of previous album. The various songs can be instantly catchy or tough to assimiliate, but very few are actually terrible. For instance, the title track descents into unnecessary repetition which just hurts its value in the end. But, for the most part, the tracks are all quite solid in their own right. <br /> <br />This album seems to head down a direction that defies the route that the Chili Peppers seemed to have been following. The production and the songs, coupled with the heavier guitar sound and vocal approach, made it tough to stomach this piece of work. In retrospect, however, it manages to stand on its own quite well. It's not a dud; it's just an odd digression that will take some time to reconcile and appreciate.

B00005JLR8|4.0|Not being knowledgeable about movie techniques, I base my comments strictly on feelings aroused by the movie:<br /><br />puzzlement - if they are immigrating from Ireland why are they driving across a border (finally realized they came in illegally through Canada)? Who is this Frankie they keep talking about (Oh, it's the deceased son)? What did they say (wish they wouldn't mumble some of the important lines)?<br /><br />Sadness - Once you get tuned in, the family's adjustment to America, to being poor, to living in a slum, to not finding work, to finding each other after the horrible loss in their life... it's sad.<br /><br />Joy - the moments where the family successfully connects or communicates with each other, or with their neighbors, particularly the black artist evoke feelings of joy.<br /><br />Beauty - despite the depressing setting and the depressing loss of Frankie, the family is beautiful and their innocence touches even the dying neighbor who before was consumed with anger at his fatal disease.<br /><br />In the final summing up, it is a movie that touches you, makes you think, and sticks in your mind. Isn't that what movie making is all about?
B000B8QF00|3.0|Even if you don't care much for Alanis Morissette's music, she is inarguably one of the most recognized singer/songwriters of our time. As a devoted fan for many years, I was pleased when I learned last year of a greatest hits package in the works. Instead, we have \\"The Collection,\\" more of a retrospective, a reflection of sorts, an offering of half hits and half...whatever. One would automatically think that such a release would contain half of the songs from her milestone album Jagged Little Pill, and with good reason since the album produced six radio hits, so the omission of \\"All I Really Want\\" from this collection is almost unforgiveable. Morissette said in an interview that she hand-picked each song for this release, so I also question why she buried many of the included hits from JLP towards the end. Not that each song should be arranged in chronlogical order, but I think most fans would enjoy hearing many of the early hits first just for the sake of reminiscence. Also not included is \\"So Pure,\\" another one of her best singles, while she only includes one other track from her second album after \\"Thank U,\\" and then there's only ONE song from her third release, Under Rug Swept. So what happened to \\"Precious Illusions?\\" or \\"21 Things I Want in a Lover?\\" Other tracks that seem out of place are a cut she did for a \\"Prayer Circle\\" collaboration, in which Morissette sings in Hungarian, and an absolutely boring cover of a Cole Porter song she recorded a couple of years back titled \\"Let's Do It,\\" but the majority of fans couldn't care less. If that isn't enough, included are \\"Sister Blister\\" and \\"Simple Together\\" from a 2002 release of B-sides and previously unreleased material, so why are they back in light of deleting more of her recognized material. So, again, maybe this \\"collection\\" wasn't meant to come across as a greatest hits compilation after all. This release does include two of Morissette's best tracks, \\"Uninvited,\\"(City of Angels)and \\"Still\\"(Dogma) but youcan also own these songs by purchasing the soundtracks from which they originated. What you won't find elsewhere is the brilliant cover Alanis recorded of Seal's 1991 hit \\"Crazy,\\" almost making it impossible on how to rate this CD with so many hits and misses all the way through, so I guess we'll go with not good, not bad, or perhaps fair to good.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|Keeping track of the storylines and characters is confusing at first. It almost has the feel that the writers brainstormed romantic or heartwarming movie plots, felt there wasn't enough meat on any one to turn into a movie and then just combined the batch of them.<br /><br />One silly storyline has a goofy 20-something traveling to America because American girls go ga-ga over a British accent. Another story shows a loyal wife discovering evidence of her husband's infidelity. This one probably merited a whole movie of its own, as the wrap up on it was somewhat inconclusive. The Hugh Grant as prime minister plot was fun, but again needed to allow more development of the love interest.<br /><br />Despite that, the film grows on you and by the end, you're celebrating each feel good solution. What started as a miscellaneous selection of people, does pull together and interconnect.<br /><br />Other plots in this movie:<br /><br />*widower reaching out to grieving son<br /><br />*betrayed writer falling for his Portuguese housemaid<br /><br />*rock star making a comeback<br /><br />*lovelorn office worker afraid to approach co-worker<br /><br />*actors developing a shy romance amid filming a porn movie<br /><br />*a best man hiding a secret passion for his best friend's bride<br /><br />*young boy trying to impress the most popular girl in school<br /><br />That's all the plot lines I can remember now. Think of it as 10 movies in one and just go with it. Many funny and touching incidents, so once you sort it out, it's enjoyable.
B000I0QK74|5.0|I've been waiting for this one for about 30 years.  JT has the PERFECT voice for Christmas music, and does a fantastic job of ensuring that Christianity is an integral part of the theme (just as he does with many of his CDs).  The best melancholy Christmas CD on the market.
B000IU3XTM|2.0|This album is, as has been mentioned before, a followup to Rice's O -- which in my estimation was an amazing CD that warranted listening to over and over again, adding to ipod playlists, creating CD's for my wife and just generally enjoying. Creative lyrics, although sometimes inscrutable (Blower's Daughter, one of my favorite songs, but what the heck is he talking about?!), made O never get old. <br /> <br />9 really misses the mark. It sounds like Damien has gone through some relationship issues that are still quite raw (affair, lack of passion, confusion, bitterness?) and although this sometimes makes for very interesting music in this case it is just too far inside the angst of Damien for me to relate to. Witness a sample of lyrics from the song 'Rootless Tree': <br /> <br />So **** you, **** you, **** you <br />And all you didn't do <br />I said leave it, leave it, leave it <br />It's nothing to you <br />And do you hate me, hate me, hate me, hate me so much <br />That you can't let me out, let me out, let me out <br />Of hell when you're around <br />Let me out, let me out, let me out <br />Hell when you're around <br />Let me out, let me out, let me out <br /> <br />Ok then. Then there is 'Me, My Yoke and I': <br /> <br />My fall, my fall <br />My fall gonna break ya <br />My fall, my fall <br />My fall gonna break your wall <br /> <br />I'm in, I'm in, I'm in <br />Like a big dog <br />I'm in, I'm in, I'm in <br />Like a big dog yeah <br />My god, my god, my god <br />Gave me a rod <br />My god, my god, my god <br />Gave me a rod <br /> <br />For fishin, fishin, fishin <br />Fishin, fishin, fishin yeah <br /> <br />Starting to get the idea? This is a self absorbed (more than usual) album that an angst filled \\"alone in my teenage bedroom\\" songwriter has written before but had the sense to not share with the world. Oh, and 'Sleep Don't Weep' ends with like 15 minutes of a Tibetan Bowl -- an annoying tone played continuously until it bores into your very skull.Was Rice just trying to see how much his listener's would put up with? <br /> <br />Having said all that, Lisa Hannigan shines once more in '9 Crimes' and Damien complements her very well, and you may find one or two more to strike your fancy, but overall I must say that the \\"emperor has no clothes\\" , even if others are afraid to say it.
B000007RYQ|4.0|On his 1997 release Urlicht / Primal Light, Uri Caine took some of Gustav Mahler's most famous compositions, and, well, jazzed them up, with some of the most prominent musicians on the downtown New York scene, including Dave Douglas and Joey Baron. <br /> <br />What still surprises me about this beautiful album is just how faithful Caine is to Mahler. Unlike his later Goldberg Variations, this isn't Mahler deconstructed, it's Mahler revered, in a small group jazz (and at times, thanks to Don Byron , klezmer) setting.  It makes perfect sense -- if some of the greatest jazz performances have come from mediocre show tunes, why not use symphonies and lieder as a starting point for improvisation?

0060254920|5.0|My 3 year old son wants this book read every night.  Three year olds are creative and this book allows them to dream.  It also allows a feeling of control over those terrible monsters.  When we first shared this book with him about 6 months ago, our son rolled his eyes in time with the story and flashed his teeth.  After reading it over and over again we have also talked about the real \\"wild thing\\" in the story, why Max's Mommy was upset with him, and whether trees can really grow in your bedroom, and how much she loved him, and how he missed his Mom.  I can easily see this book growing with our son on many different levels.
0596007124|5.0|At first, the pagecount is intimidating but once you start reading you realize the format bloats the size somewhat.  But, do not think that it being oversized means there is not much here.  This is one of the best programming books I have yet encountered.  No other self-study tool for programming has provided such a rapid learning curve in my experience.  And after reading this one, I can hardly wait to start another.  In addition, this book makes for a handy reference after reading.  Very highly recommended to share with your Java software team in particular.  The format is to present a design problem then solve it with a design pattern.  The examples are simple yet complex enough to map to real world concepts.  The book is packed with class diagrams and enough code examples to illustrate each of the many patterns it discusses.  Again, very highly recommended.
B000ICLRJ8|4.0|I was concerned that this movie would either be influenced by the continued backlash from Viet Nam or would be so incredibly over-the-top as to be completely unbelievable. I was pleased that the movie combined a bit of political intrigue with generally realistic military action to yield a very enjoyable movie. There are a few moments where the movie is unbelievable, but those moments are few enough to get you to the end.<br /><br />Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) and his friend and partner Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht) are flying a routine mission over Bosnia. They fly into territory into which they are not permitted. During their flight they see something on the ground that causes them to take a closer look. Using their new digital image recording system they take high-speed pictures of an area that incriminates Serbians in aggression towards Bosnians. The Serbians shoot down the F-18 with SAMs, later blaming the incident on rebel Bosnians.<br /><br />Once the plane is shot down the two vulnerable pilots are quickly found by Serbian forces. Stackhouse is quickly executed, causing Burnett to yell in anguish and anger, which was a serious mistake because Stackhouse's executioner hears Burnett, and the chase is on.<br /><br />This movie is all about the chase. Burnett runs for his life, trying to reach an extraction point. The Serbian executioner that murdered Stackhouse chases Burnett almost to the end of the film. During the chase there are several incidents that were very creative, though incredible in their coincidence. One example happens when Burnett has a large group of Serbians on his heels. The chase is being watched from Burnett's aircraft carrier, the Carl Vinson. When Burnett trips and falls according to the infrared image, the anxious crew of the Carl Vinson are sure he is dead, yet the chasing Serbians miraculously do not find him. You'll have to watch the movie to see why.<br /><br />Burnett tries continually to make his way to the rendezvous point for extraction, and is continuously stymied. Eventually the Serbians convince NATO that Burnett has been killed by the rebels, and the Carl Vinson prepares to head for home. But, as we all know, Burnett is still trying to get out. I will not spoil the ending, which is the one portion of the movie that is really over-the-top, reminiscent of James Bond.<br /><br />While the movie contains flaws in how the action is portrayed, for entertainment and patriotism it is a good bet, particularly if you enjoy military action movies.<br /><br />The only question I have is whether this film is worth purchasing in Blu-Ray.  The price of the standard DVD version is significantly less than the Blu-Ray version, and I do not believe the Blu-Ray version has enough difference in video quality to justify the price difference.  My recommendation is to either wait until the price of the Blu-Ray version decreases or just buy the DVD version.<br /><br />Enjoy!int for extraction, and is continuously stymied.

0618680004|5.0|This is a mildly entertaining and informative read. The book has been extremely controversial, mainly due to the title and the semi-divine status bestowed upon Richard Dawkins by the atheistic community. What is most interesting about the contents of this book (amply described in other reviews), is that Dawkins himself has almost nothing original to add to the science-religion debate. What are found in this book are re-hashed arguments that anyone with an interest in theology or philosophy will know well enough. How is it that someone like Dawkins comes to be known as one of the greatest thinkers of our time? I'm afraid that after reading The God Delusion I have no answer to this question.    Dawkins makes a fundamental error in his entire analysis of religion and its implication in the problems experienced in the world. Since evil and the spiritual longing and expression exist side-by-side within most humans and societies, Dawkins assumes that one causes the other. A little knowledge of probability theory and statistics would be of immense benefit to Dawkins.    However, I think religious people of all persuasions should read this book. If this is the best shot that can be taken at religion, then believers of all faiths have nothing to fear. And the informed religious reader will get a chance to compare the thinking of the great spiritual leaders who have imbued people's lives with love, meaning and structure with one of the cold, withered and egotistical minds of one of our would-be secular gods.    And now I offer a koan free of charge: MOST ATHEISTS ARE CORRECT IN THEIR BELIEFS, BUT THERE IS A GOD. THIS MAKES THEM WRONG.    PS: I was intentionally being controversial with my title - precisely because most atheists love to be taken very seriously and to feel that they have power over other people. What is most entertaining is that many/most of these atheists have chosen the path of atheism as a substitute for religion i.e. they derive all the benefits, and even have the structure, of a religion. And why? Because they don't have the courage to embrace the true significance of their beliefs. They always claim to have the good of others or the world in mind, but can never offer a coherent definition of what good is or why anyone else should accept it.  I would rather be a nutter (or be stupid for that matter), than be a self-righteous prig gaining a sense of superiority by trying to destroy the beliefs of others.  Unfortunately God has ordained that we must live with offensive people (like me), some being atheists and some believers.
B0006GAOCW|1.0|Okay, I was actually at the video store looking for a copy of Drive Me Crazy and I found one for 26 dollars.  Then I found it in a double pack with First Daughter for only 15 dollars.   <br /> <br />I got the double pack because it was cheaper and decided to have a look at First Daughter.   <br /> <br />I had to turn off the movie after 15 minutes.  Katie Holmes's character had the personality of cardboard.  She seems to spend her time walking around with a fake smile plastered on her face pretending to have fun. <br /> <br />These movies are always the same - rich girl wants a real life, she rebels and falls in love with some handsome guy who looks like a model, he teachs her about real life, they fall in love, they either have a fight or betray each other, then get back together at the end. <br /> <br />Katie Holmes bored me and so did the guy she fell in love with.  I could see what was going to happen next.  The whole movie was so sickly sweet I literally wanted to throw up. <br /> <br />I think I'll stick to Drive Me Crazy and just forget that I own this movie. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002B15PG|5.0|Russell Crowe (Capt. Jack Aubrey) stars in this classic sea epic about naval warfare during the Napoleonic wars.  The year is 1805 and Napoleon's armies are set to invade England.  The world's oceans have now become battlefields as well.  The French frigate Acheron has been sent to the South Atlantic Ocean to journey around South America and into the Pacific Ocean to raid English whaling vessels.   <br /> <br />Capt. Aubrey's vessel, the HMS Surprise, stands in the Acheron's way.  After a battle off of the Brazillian coast in which the Surprise suffered considerable damage, the French ship made good its escape.  Faster than its English counterpart, it is able to increase the distance between itself and the slower British ship. <br /> <br />During the course of the movie, the viewer gets to experience sailing, sea tactics, and life in general aboard a sailing ship.  Young officers who were in fact pre-teenage children were routinely placed aboard these vessels to learn the art of seamanship from the more experienced crewmembers.  Capt. Aubrey lends in his navigational talents to the training.  Battles are ferocious and often deadly, and young and old alike are the unfortunate casualties.  The overcrowding, poor food, and mental stress of being cramped on a ship for months on end is accurately portrayed, as well.  However, the men are sustained by the thrill of the chase and moments of courage, especially by Capt. Aubrey. <br /> <br />Tough choices are made as well, such as when one of the crewmembers is swept overboard, but Capt. Aubrey is forced to make the agonizing decision to leave him behind rather than risk his ship and crew.   <br /> <br />Starring along with Crowe is Paul Bettany, who plays Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon.  He provides a kind of antithesis to Capt. Aubrey's sense of duty.  The pair play music together, eat together, and get drunk together, and there is a true sense of trust and friendship among them.  While chasing the Acheron, the Surprise stops in the Galapagos islands, where Dr. Maturin discovers many different species of animals, but Capt. Aubrey informs the doctor that the Surprise must resume the pursuit of the Acheron.  This decision drives a wedge between the Captain and the doctor.   <br /> <br />Upon sighting the Acheron, Capt. Aubrey comes up with a plan to disguise his ship as a whaling vessel in the hopes of drawing the bigger and heavier-armed Acheron closer.  The plan works, and a teriffic sea battle ensues.  Will the Acheron win, or will Aubrey's Surprise pull of a \\"surprise\\" of its own? <br /> <br />This is an excellent movie.  The action is non-stop, and Russell Crowe does a magnificent job as the charismatic Capt. Aubrey.  Life aboard a sailing ship in the early 1800s is accurately shown, and the sea battles are truly exhilarating. <br /> <br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Fans of great sea action and adventure will surely enjoy this great movie.

B0001VTPWM|4.0|RoboCop: 1987 <br />It's almost funny how close this is to being a bad movie or even a TERRIBLE movie. All the overzelous \\"punks\\" are here, the dated presentation, and some fairly aged stop motion animation would appear to add up to a RoboFlop. But dig deeper. Peter Weller practically single handedly turns this movie into something of legend. I will stop there. I don't want to give this movie too much praise because it does have some deep problems, but when you toll up the human element, the longing, the memory of family, his detachment, it practically is a modern day Frankenstein. The lead baddies are actually well represented and fleshed out, which is very important and the actual RoboCop \\"gear\\" still looks sweet and actually holds up well. I do get the feeling there were budget contraints but I'm shocked at this movie succeeding on many levels the Terminator misses. Throw in many dvd extras and the excellant box art and I can safely say this movie alone was worth the $15 I spent for the entire set. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />RoboCop 2: 1990 <br />For the first 45 minutes or so I was marveling at what may be a true stellar dark horse series. This second movie opened up getting everything right I liked about the first one... then at about that point the wheels fell off and the story suddenly went south with the telling of a second RoboCop... a drug addicted convict. Peter Weller may have been absent from half this movie! Which is really a shame because believe it or not most of cast isn't really that bad it's just that the story is so poorly constructed it's hard to even tell who, what, and mostly why. It's easier to digest once you realize this series seems to be purposely \\"B movie\\" material but it doesn't make it any more entertaining. I did find it interesting to see Robo riding a Harley... 2 years before Arnold. 6/10 <br /> <br />RoboCop 3: 1992 <br />Sort of works as a \\"bad movie\\". The Neo Punk look and most of the actors range from horrid to so-so. Peter Weller is no longer RoboCop which surprisingly doesn't affect this movie as much as I thought it would. Still how can you have a RoboCop movie where, again, he is missing from half the movie and you spend that time watching uninteresting \\"rebel movements\\" and even worse, bad robot ninjas? I really cannot understand how the script was approved. Through it all it was marginally entertaining but definitely the worst of the three. It does have some decent human moments, but mostly it just shouldn't have been made... like this. 4.5/10
B000J103X4|2.0|I was really pulling for Game on this but he feel way short of the Documentary.  If it weren't for some great producers and cool collaborations, this album would be a complete flop. <br /> <br />Game's lyrical content is so wack now.  All he talks about on the entire album is Dr. Dre, his impala, how he's the king of the west coast (often comparing himself to the greats) and just drops names.  He has absolutely nothing worth while to say.  Pac and Cube didn't have to pound their chests letting us know they were the best on every song; we already knew it.  It went without saying. <br /> <br />As much as I dislike 50, the man can write a hook and that's what he's missing here.  There are songs on the first LP that are so much better than anything on here (Hate it or love it, Dreams, etc.)  There really isn't a standout single that people will remember for years to come.  The album is far from classic. <br /> <br />I give him credit for singlehandily destroying G-Unit but if I were a rapper, there are so many holes in this release by the Game that I'd eat him alive with ease. <br /> <br />Step your Game up next time out!

0345451325|5.0|As anyone who has ever reached for a game novel knows, it's more than likely gonna suck big time. I was literally shocked at the quality of this novel. It seriously is one of the best science fiction/fantasy reads I've ever had, and I've had alot! It's astonishing how little Nylund had to work with and developed such a rich world, with great background constructs, and exciting action. It's as if Nylund is reaching for some tracendency in a Halo book with each page of the novel. I'm serious! The battles are so expertly crafted, that you can culminate the visual in your mind of the Chief jumping through space to another craft, or the astoundingly well written section on Keyes maneuvering against two superior covenant vessels and coming out victorious. This all in a Halo novel! Bravo good sir. They should never let anyone else write another Halo novel again, or be damned.
0895260131|5.0|This book is very good for telling the truth about Islam.  Many of the major atrocities we read about are coming from the Middle East, yet they blame the West for their troubles.  I think it is time for some self reflection on the part of the muslims to learn the error in their ways and make ammends.  Much of muslim history has been involving conflict with other cultures and, even to this day, are unable and unwilling to accept other cultures.
B000J103X4|5.0|This is the best album that I've heard in years. The Game is definitely gonna be a modern day Pac. To this day Pac is still my favorite rapper so it means a lot to put Game in that spotlight. This album is flawless. Sounds ol' school and definitely worthy to go quintuple platinum. It's official, although I love Dre, Game don't need Dre and definitely not punk 50. it's an album for the westcoast that'll be banged for years
B000099T2L|4.0|Its funny to read these reviews from 3 years ago (its 2006 now) and then compare them to B-Day's reviews. There are so many people (myself included) who long for the quality of Dangerously in Love. I loved this album because it seems as though B is giving us a glimpse of the different facets of Beyonce. Her songwriting is superb compared to B-Day. One thing that I would have to disagree with a lot of reviewers of Dangerously in Love is that I don't think this album had a lot of bad fillers. I think that the whole thing (Minus: That's how you like it, The closer I get to you, and that song about her dad)was pretty good. I love Hip Hop Star, and Speechless. My only complaint is that she should have used the Dangerously in Love from Destiny's Child's Survivor. They changed the music, and it sounded kind of corny. Other than that, I thought it was a great debut album.
B0002858YS|3.0|If you liked or grew up with some of that old 80s stuff like the Cure or the Smiths you'll probably like this.  Musically it's lighter, not quite as emotionally rich or heartfelt or experimental (who could forget the Cure's Head on the Door)...sort of like some protected middle class kids grew up listening to big bro's old vinyl...but it's well crafted and innovative enough not to miss. <br />
0743289412|5.0|My expectations of Lisey's Story were mixed, knowing that I had been disappointed with the \\"romantic\\" angle of Bag of Bones.  I am a voracious King reader, however, and was delighted to begin Lisey's Story. <br /> <br />I was SHOCKED and absolutely amazed at how aptly King captures the grief of a widow and the connections of a true relationship, a true marriage, in all its ups, downs, frights, and triumphs.  For a man to write a woman's emotions so well they can be felt is a true inspiration.  I found myself moved to tears in more than one spot. <br /> <br />There have been reader complaints about the \\"made-up language\\" that flows throughout the books.  To them, I say-- do you and your family, your spouse, your friends not have inside jokes?  Is there nothing you say that is foreign to those outside the close circle of your heart?  It's a truth of any relationship that has spanned between people over any length of time, and one he illustrates beautifully.  In addition, a writer-- any writer-- will have his or her own way of speaking, of thinking, and it's not like the rest of the world.  Call it indulgent if you must, but it is true, and it rings true.  The \\"childishness\\" of some of the language in the book serves its purpose well, showing Scott's regression to his most formative years. <br /> <br />For anyone who dismissed King long ago as only a horror author, or \\"only\\" commercial fiction, I urge them to read this, and for those readers who want to see him only churn out \\"scary\\" books by the dozens, I urge you to do him a favor and stay away-- no artist needs to be tied down.
0618680004|4.0|Critics of Richard Dawkins' new book The God Delusion ultimately characterize his work as both angry and vitriolic, or more tamely, polemic. These are unhelpful descriptions as each fails to ask the question whether Dawkins has something to be angry, vitriolic or polemic about. Too many cultural commentators want to engender what they claim to be a thought process, but is in all actuality a feeling, that we should find a middle road between the mandates of science and the insights of spirituality. The bargain such people strike to make has value, but only where we can manage to clearly differentiate between those areas of life which science can and has spoken to, and those where it has not. <br /> <br />A number of reviewers from prestigious newspapers, periodicals and journals have already commented on what they see as the merits and missteps of Dawkins' book; however, many of them have not wrestled with several of the critical insights in his work. To resort to the ambiguous but doubtlessly effective (at least as measured by persuading people not to be bothered with Dawkins) charge that his analysis is angry, is to be unwilling to meet Dawkins on the grounds of his arguments. It should be said that, in the interests of fairness, Dawkins is surprisingly willing not to resort to similar vagaries. While a portion of his book does deal with fundamentalism and its various confused pulpiteers such as Dobson, Falwell and their ilk, this is only a small section of his book. That he is willing to bear the responsibility for pointing out what these people actually believe, their hopes for reshaping American culture, and how their beliefs impact hard science should not mean that we relegate Dawkins to the same heap of exasperation we do fundamentalists. <br /> <br />Perhaps it is the biologist within Dawkins that leads him to believe a parallel exists between biological cancer and similarly suspicious malignant ideological growths. While many of us wish to overlook fundamentalists with the hope they will simply go away, Dawkins fears this might not only be naïve, but irresponsible. History is full of moments when society has regressed, labeling dissent the path to eternal damnation instead of earthly wisdom. While it might be that the inherent practical nature of the American people will be offended by the objectives of religious fundamentalism, rebel and find our historical balance, we easily forget that this balance is many times found only because of the clarion call from those who see the creeping influence and suspicious agendas of fundamentalists and require that we respond. A certain shame should be accorded to those who view with equal exasperation the fundamentalist and those who believe they can not be dismissed, but must be responded to. <br /> <br />As a scientist, Dawkins is privy to a particular question which contemporary culture largely believes remains unanswered, but science does not. This question is the hot-button issue of evolution. For many, belief in evolution is somehow inter-related with issues like abortion and homosexuality. No doubt, within the realm of ideological inquiry, we may successfully frame almost any issue in majestic terms that invoke non-quantitative words which have, at their core, the ability to project and then protect the idea that certain questions are unanswerable through rigorous scientific inquiry. <br /> <br />At its base, the question of evolution echoing in the head of the average person probably has less to do with science and more to do with the implications from scientific inquiry and theory in general. People's intuition subconsciously registers the threat that evolution presents; namely, that naturalism may be a task master no less demanding than certain religious systems. The idea that we may have only one opportunity to experience life adds a certain intensity within it which many currently avoid by pushing their hopes, aspirations and expectations (of themselves and others) into an afterlife. Additionally, among profound thoughts, few exceed the evolutionary realization that life on this planet is precious, inter-related, and that the environment must be viewed as a holistic organism within which we individually and collectively play an important role. <br /> <br />What scares Dawkins is probably the realization that for many people, the insights of evolutionary theory are believed to be inseparable from a descent into animalistic hedonism. Never mind that ideas like morality have equivalents in the animal kingdom, as do love, nurturing and protecting life. If one of the fundamental truths of the natural universe is Darwinism, we should share a certain amount of alarm with Dawkins that the implications to evolutionary science are being so poorly received. Man owes no duty to myth or to tradition, and finds progress only in those moments in time when verifiable truth is allowed to dictate how we engage reality. In this sense, Dawkins bears the vanguard of members of the natural sciences like Galileo who believed that any supposedly spiritual truth which could not bear the light of modernity was not worth protecting in the first place. <br /> <br />For those who wish to somehow tiptoe around the theory of evolution, Dawkins is perceived as hostile. To those who believe something important might actually be at stake by understanding where life comes from and how it develops, Dawkins is fighting for a solitary focus on what we know, not what we wish to believe is true. This latter point has not only important philosophical, scientific and theological outcomes, it has immense practical value by freeing the abused spouse or child to realize that what they wish to be true - that the abuser loves them, but is unaware of how to show it - is simply a prison from which they can only escape by separating what they wish was true from what can be verified as loving. <br /> <br />To his credit, Dawkins takes his scientific and philosophical critics seriously and responds assertively. Those who see his book as bracing are not being fair - if scientific inquiry is to mean anything it must not blanch at challenges which attempt and endlessly find some open hole through which they can see the shortcomings to a particular theory. Dawkins is never better than when defending the difference between science and theology, where one sees ignorance as limits to inquiry and knowledge versus the other as the gap only a creator god can fill. In a successful effort to be intellectually serious, Dawkins carefully uses examples of fundamentalists within hard science. This is probably because they are a rare species (perhaps his critics wish his biologist's sense of the need to protect endangered life was more acutely directed towards them), but more likely because he knows well they can create straw men which he does not appreciate being used on him. Dawkins' treatment of the classical arguments for intelligent design, Anselm and Aquinas' postulates for the proof of God are treated similarly respectfully, which is not to say they fare well in his hands. <br /> <br />It would surprise me if this book did more than add fuel to the fire; however, if we wish to employ a literary euphemism such as this, it would be appropriate to state that sometimes fire is nature's way of regulating itself (as the blow-down effect in the northern woods suggests). If so, the fire Dawkins is building may be an important part of our growth in consciousness. People who look to Dawkins with a critical eye towards what he suggests about internal spirituality should be careful as this was not the primary, or even secondary, thrust of his analysis. The purpose of this book was to deal with a particular set of concerns which Dawkins believes represents a bulwark to the progress of humanity. In a hat-tip to this inevitable criticism, towards the end of his book Dawkins does present a middle way which suggests a vehicle for transitioning between where most humanity is and the implications of evolutionary biology. While well-intentioned and certainly not without its merits, I much prefer writers who consider evolution's insights fixed and have moved on to wrestle with how we reshape religion into conscious personal enlightenment. <br /> <br />To be a spry debater is not to be mean. Many who mistake Dawkins' assertive and direct style for vitriol do so less because they believe his attitude prevents civil discourse, and more in the hopes that society can advance without calling ineptness for its inadequacies, and confusing current limits of human knowledge with the inevitability of supernatural explanations. At his base, Dawkins does not feel compelled to believe without proof, an attitude which some believe has value only within the sciences. Among the many insights to this book, perhaps the one which will stick with most is the simple realization that we have no need of beliefs which can not be tested or of ideas which give solace but wither under scrutiny. What we may hope for should not be what we believe, lest we give in to any number of delusions, only one of which is, as Dawkins describes, The God Delusion.
B0000042MY|5.0|This is the first cd I ever owned, bought for me as a Christmas present back in 1993 when I was 13, and I still listen to it on a regular basis. <br /> <br />When I was younger I mostly just liked the music because I liked the movie, but as I've grown older, I've gotten to appreciate the melodies and the emotions that I feel when I listen to it. <br /> <br />The soundtrack was composed by two different composers, Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman.  Edelman stepped in to finish the soundtrack after Jones was unable to complete his work due to a commitment with another film, but the songs mesh together so well, you can hardly tell the difference between the work of the two. <br /> <br />My two favorite songs on the album are \\"The Kiss\\" and \\"I Will Find You\\". <br /> <br />If you ever loved instrumental music, pick this album up.  You won't be sorry.
B00006JJ51|4.0|NWA was an original rap group and with that being said, this is definitely a must have album for rap lovers. Along with Public Enemy, NWA christened their genre with hard core lyrics and tight bass beats. Although I don't agree with some of their lyrics, one would not expect this white kid to fully understand their view on life. Anyways, buy this album, I recommend it. Keep it away from the kiddies though!
B0007OY2P8|3.0|I was a bit surprised at the movie.  The musical score was intended to highlight the gothic-horror imaginings of the heroine, but I found it irritating and disruptive at times.   <br /> <br />The screenplay took too many liberties with dialogue, and the characters were over-done (Isabella, for example, bared her teeth throughout and was in no way charming). <br /> <br />Perhaps if I hadn't read the book half a dozen times, it would have pleased me more?
B000I5X80G|5.0|As one of the most rabid Neil Young fans alive, I cannot for the life of me understand what all the fuss is about regarding the absence of the first half of this set. There are countless other opportunities to purchase phenomenal recordings of Neil's live solo acoustic work that could not possibly have been outdone by the inclusion of the same songs here.<br /><br />Albums such as \\"Four Way Street,\\" \\"Live Rust\\" and, most recently, the \\"Heart of Gold\\" DVD as well as the DVD accompaniment to \\"Greendale\\" on which Neil performs each song from that album in a sizzling, stripped-down form live in Dublin, are excellent samples of Neil as a live acoustic performer. Why it is so utterly necessary to hear Neil sing \\"I Am A Child\\" or \\"The Loner\\" on yet another live album is completely beyond me.<br /><br />The point here is that this legendary show was one of Neil's final performances with the brilliant Danny Whitten, Crazy Horse's original lead guitarist, just a year before Whitten died of an overdose--a death that plunged Neil into an oblivion of drunken regret and self-loathing that produced what is widely considered his masterpiece: \\"Tonight's the Night.\\" Whitten wasn't in the band to strum an acoustic guitar as Neil crooned on about an Old Laughing Lady; he was there to electrify some of Crazy Horse's most enduring anthems--Down by the River and Cowgirl in particular--and he exceeds that expectation throughout this set.<br /><br />But the boundless treasure contained in merely six tracks here includes a gorgeous rendition of Neil's tune \\"Wonderin',\\" a song originally intended for a very early Crazy Horse album that didn't see the light of day until Neil's unlistenable 1983 Rockabilly rant, \\"Everybody's Rockin.\\" The most moving moment on the CD--and one worth the price of the album alone--is to hear Neil introduce \\"Danny Whitten on guitar\\" before the band explodes into a riotous take on Danny's \\"Come on Baby Let's Go Downtown\\" with Whitten on lead vocal.<br /><br />The sound is unbelievable throughout the album, and these are easily the finest verions of these songs I have ever heard (and I've heard all of them). At just six tracks, \\"Live at the Fillmore East\\" is nonetheless an embarrassment of riches that is worth every penny and moment spent, as I did, parked in a strip-mall parking lot with the seat back, the stereo blasting out the open windows, and my entire face curling into a grin of absolute and invincible joy./>The sound is unbelievable throughout the album, and these are easily the finest verions of these songs I have ever heard (and I've heard all of them).

So much excitement surrounded this album because he broke through MTV with If I ruled the World. Also Nas was the elite MC in the eyes of many including me. He caught flack for not releasing Illmatic 2, but life is different when you leave home and get some money.    Lyrics on here are still inspiring:  I Gave You Power (Classic)  Black Girl Lost  Street Dreams  Take it in Blood  Watch Dem  Affirmative Action (Nas, Foxy, AZ and Cormega) Classic  Live N*gga Rap  Silent Murder (Classic)    Nas flow was peerless.

B0007Y08I8|3.0|Team America is a frequently funny parody of the common action film, done with puppets.  It is utterly amazing how often the satire is dead on the mark and how very close the dialogue and plotting is to the real big screen thrillers that it mocks.  If you pay attention you will notice  whole lines that are stolen right out of other films [such as Armageddon].  The last half of the movie plays like an impeachment of liberal Hollywood, painfully skewering various left leaning actors without mercy and finding creative ways of killing off each of their stand-in puppets.  Most of the celebrity puppets are dead ringers for their real selves [particularly Sean Penn]. It's hard to imagine that these film makers would have any friends left in Hollywood after the way they toasted tinsel town.  It's hard to imagine there are many from the other side of the aisle that would stand and cheer either, considering the distasteful jokes and unimaginably gross hyjinx.  <br /> <br />It's all real fun and amusing.  However, it is the sickest, foulest, filthiest, most crude movie I have ever seen.  My mind's eye may never come clean.  This thing goes way beyond the normal gross-out teen comedy to nearly nudy-picture material.  Who would have ever thought that marionettes could be so vile and potty-mouthed and just plain disgusting?  I will never be able to watch a puppet show again; it would just be too painful. <br /> <br />The film makers are obviously creative, intelligent and slick people.  It's too bad they don't have an ounce of sublety in them because if they could just tone down the needless yuck then everyone could enjoy their humor.

What a wonderful insight into humanity and the good that can come out in the worst of times.  What the author has captured is the good that is born in the midst of flawed, trying to make sense of it all. The character are all very believeable and therefore, challenge you without being preachy.  The use of death as a narrator adds to the book as well as some of the innovative ways the author presents information.

I have the Hallmark CD, but this new one is worth the price simply to add \\"River\\" and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" to the holiday grouping.  His rendition of the latter song really captures the poignancy that song is supposed to have.  Play this CD, grab a glass of your favorite adult beverage, and go put up the tree.  I'll take James' music in the background any day!
B000IU3XTM|5.0|I have to disagree with the Amazon review. 9 is every bit the worthy successor of O. In fact, I feel Rice has expanded his sound a little including a few more upbeat tracks. His lyrics remain at his pristine best, poignantly dark and still emotionally stirring.<br /><br />The opener 9 Crimes is a chill-inducing ballad with Lisa Hannigan, just like a terribly frank exchange of words between a desolate couple. Then there is the movingly lovelorn The Animals Were Gone ending in a sweeping violin climax and the evocative Elephant where Rice rises from a mere whisper to eventual heart-tearing scream towards the end. Things go on a lighter note on the seemingly lyrically-inane Dogs and Coconut Skins and this is where the causal listeners need to read further.<br /><br />Grey Room comes closest to being an O continuation, along the lines of the  splendid Delicate.<br />The closer Sleep, Don't Weep ends the album on a tender note, almost like Rice having reached a resolution of sorts, then quite not yet there.<br /><br />9 is definitely the answer to a long 4-year wait after O. Savour the greatness, it just might be another 4 years before good music like this is bestowed upon us again.
B000000OY9|5.0|I actually really do Love this album, but then I really love it when Young goes exploring and doesnt just do something just to please his Harvest fans. I mean I love Harvest too.but I already have Harvest, so why do I want him to do it again!  I didnt even realize he was doing this sort of exploring during the 80s so I only came upon this album recently . whereas in the 60s and 70s I did consider myself a fan of his music, it wasnt until the 90s that I became a real fan of Young himself and all his creations and projects. I just love how he keeps surprising me .The past 6 years in particular and thats what made me start to explore his \\"missing years\\" ...the years I wasnt paying attention during the 80s. <br />maybe because I did go into this Album with the idea that I now know Young to be a musical and technical adventurer I was ready for anything... but even then I was more than pleasantly surprised by it and its now one of my favorite Young Albums. <br />of course to put that in perspective,I guess I should also add that my favorite Young projects are  : After the Gold Rush, Harvest, Rust Never Sleeps { One of my top fave Concerts I ever went to} Zuma, Ragged Glory, Greendale{another favorite concert} and Prarie Wind . Thats not to take anything away from others, but just the ones I tend to go back to most often. <br />I am so glad to find Landing on Water. In fact I think I need to listen to it again right now..
B000K7VHPU|5.0|I saw this movie opening week.  I absolutly loved this film!  Magical with its suspense. Finaly, a movie with an unexpected twist - actually caught me off guard. Except for Jessica Biel, the acting is top notch.  Jessica has not broken the 7th Heaven range of acting, but I will keep looking at her career and hope she developes to leading lady roles.  As for Ed Norton & Paul Giamatti, they are two of the best actors in films today. I highly recomend this movie to anyone who loves a true love story with lots of mystery through out.
0440180295|5.0|One of the greatest books I have ever read, and I have read a lot. <br />A must read for every human being able to think for her/himself.

0553062182|5.0|well, I haven't atcually read this book, so I probably have no right to post here. But my mother has not stopped talking about it. I think it is interesting how many people gave it such bad reviews. Perhaps they are reading the wrong book.<br /><br />When my mother stumbled upon this book accidentally and started to read it, she almost cried with relief. She could not believe how closely it described how she has felt for most of her life. As she read it, she felt as though it explained so many things to her about her anxieties and she felt as though a weight were being lifted from her. It gave her hope and ideas on how to deal with her sensitivity. I think this book really applies to a certain group of people who are born with HPS and if it applies to you, you could find it to be very enlightening. It might even change your life.
B0000DCGT3|4.0|This is almost as funny as American Pie and American Pie 2, but the humor is getting more than a little predictable.  However, I am still laughing so 4 stars.
0152048049|2.0|This is a beautifull presented book, but this translation is NOT good.  Get the translation by Cathy Woods.  It captures much more of the poetry and quaintness that Richard Howard has seen fit to tear from St Exupery's exquisite writing.
0767836286|5.0|You will never come off the edge of your seat.  You never see the last turn coming...until it is WAY too late.  Just like Jeff Bridge's character, Faraday.  He didn't see it coming until it was too late to do anything, but run and scream.  This moving will leave you blue from holding your breathe.  You will definitely need to do some relaxation work after this moving!
0689878451|1.0|Roy and Silo, the two penguins used, as the \\"inspiration\\" for this bogus tale are not homosexual penguins.  The moment Silo was introduced to \\"Scrappy\\" the female penguin he took off with her.  Male Penguins often sit on eggs.  <br /> <br />Before you buy this book rent or buy the movie \\"March of the Penguins\\" and you will learn the truth.  You can also Google the information I shared above. <br /> <br />I think it's important that readers know the truth before they introduce their children to this awful indoctrination material.  <br /> <br />BEWARE:  \\"Just because it is written, doesn't make it so.\\"
B000HCO83Q|3.0|I enjoyed the X-men comic books since I was a kid.  Apparently, they became something else after I stopped reading comics in my mid-teens.  The first couple of these movies were pretty fun and this one provides the big battle Magneto has been aiming at for quite awhile.<br /><br />What I don't like about this movie is the sheer number of mutants.  I mean, there are so many of them by what definition could they be mutations?  And since all their powers seem more or less unique, what in the world could be happening genetically (which is more about conserving useful traits)?<br /><br />Anyway, the mutants go to war because the government has come up with a \\"cure\\" that suppresses the mutant's mutantness.  And while some mutants want to take this cure, others feel that it is wrong to cure any of them because it is tantamount to admitting that being a mutant means something is wrong with you.  We see this in real life with a movement working against the notion that it would be a blessing to provide them with hearing.  There are other aspects that the X-Men movies allude to none to subtly that I will not comment on except to note that we all know it is there.<br /><br />The big scenes are all quite spectacular and there are lots and lots and lots of mutants with some cool and some silly powers.  This whole cure thing has some odd effects and it isn't only the tangential characters that get whacked in this one.<br /><br />So, enjoy!  But don't expect to get too much in the way of character development.  And you might want to throw a rubber brick at the screen for some of the plot twists chosen.
B00092QUQC|5.0|These guys are a superb rock band. This album is filled with great songs from start to finish with absolutely no filler at all. The production is very big and the guitars sound cool. Great riffing from the guitarist. The highlight of the album is the amazing vocal lines and the brilliant delivery of them. The singer has nailed the power and the passion of the vocals and created some outstanding hooks. It really is a great album to listen to all the way through and really gets you rocking and fist pumping! Great driving music and highly recommended to fans of melodic rock like TNT (My religion) and Glenn Hughes.
B000069KE0|5.0|Are you a fan of Zappa?  Beck?  Walter Becker?  Lucero?  Replacements? <br /> <br />If so, a few drinks (or tokes) combined with this on the turntable will have you sitting pensively, stroking your beard (or scruff), and pondering the rich antecedents to the pop landscape that grant us the music we enjoy today.  <br /> <br />Have we lately heard horns played in the \\"CTA\\" style?  Hardly, since tight orchestration has given way to unscripted, \\"interpretive\\" performances in modern pop.   Of course it's not bad - it's evolutionary after all - but where's the next \\"Wake Up Sunshine\\"? <br /> <br />This is the music that brings us back to our roots.  Listen, reflect and enjoy.
B000F48CD8|5.0|Being a white stripes fan, of course I had to check out Jacks latest.  This album does not dissappoint and is truly distinguished from any of <br />the Raconteur members' previous efforts.  Together. they really sound <br />good.  Really talented songwriting on the title track Broken Boy Soldier. <br />Guitar picking really jumps out at you.  I think my favorite song on the <br />album is secretary though.  The CD's been in my car for the past month <br />and still not tired of hearing it.
B000H305U0|4.0|2006 has had no shortage of surprises: North Korea tested a nuke, Vice President Dick Cheney shot a lawyer, and the Democrats took control of Capital Hill for the first time since 1994.  Justin Timberlake's FUTURESEX/LOVESOUNDS, the long-awaited follow-up to his 2003 solo debut JUSTIFIED, is yet another surprise.  It's an album masked in a heavy sheet of glittering pop; beneath that mask is one of the best albums of the year and what may wind up as one of the defining records of the new millennium's first decade.  The odds of people discovering this are rather slim: after all, how many people do you think will listen to an album by a former member of N'Sync (or at least listen to it and admit to doing so)?  Not a whole lot, and that's a pity, because on FUTURESEX/LOVESOUNDS, Justin Timberlake sets out to prove that he's much more than the lead singer of an old boy band.  And prove it he does.    One of the biggest surprises of FUTURESEX/LOVESOUNDS is that it is, quite frankly, the most unsexy \\"sex album\\" ever released.  Through the whole album, Timberlake tries to maximize its sex appeal, and though he fails in that aspect, he succeeds in another: he creates a cold, false, emotionless atmosphere that perfectly captures the attitude of our society in the 21st century.  On FUTURESEX, sex is simply a tool for brief gratification, to be used with anyone and anyone at any time.  It doesn't really mean anything, like having a one-night stand at some unruly late-night party.  The music itself is equally harsh and sounds almost as though it was assembled from the lonely, emotion-devoid thoughts of a computer, thanks largely to the fact that it's completely electronic.  In another surprise, FUTURESEX/LOVESOUNDS sounds more like the product of such 1980s R&B funk gods as Prince and Michael Jackson than the creation of an ex-N'Syncer.  All the familiar elements are here: exotic percussion, playful keyboards, inviting bass, and excited vocals.  \\"LoveStoned\\" sounds as though itwas yanked off THRILLER, and a more hearty \\"SexyBack\\" could've been a Prince creation back in the day.     The thing that restrains Timberlake from ranking among the likes of the aforementioned superstars isn't so much a lack of talent as a lack of willingness to experiment.  True, FUTURESEX/LOVESOUNDS sounds considerably different than much of recently-released music, but only different enough to make it distinguishable from your everyday contemporary album.  Timberlake is willing to step up to the line to prove that he's not what everyone thinks he is, but he seems afraid to step over the line, to really produce something new and delightfully original like his heroes.  Timberlake sticks mostly to the thick, heavily-overused hip-hop beats, deviating from the norm just enough to make an impression.  He does succeed in that aspect, as the album does make an impression, but not enough of an impression to really knock the listener out.  Though it gets off to a great start, the album lags a little toward the end, leaving the listener with an appreciation for what Timberlake has done, but also with the desire for him to do more.  Maybe that's what he wants; people will certainly pay more attention to his next release.    FUTURESEX/LOVESOUNDS isn't a masterpiece, but it stands out from the increasing number of lifeless, unoriginal albums, and for that reason alone it may be worth checking out.  It works excellently as a time capsule, a collection of music that may be looked upon years from now as a fitting representation of the music of 2006.  Still, it's nowhere near experimental enough, and it's Timberlake's fear of experimentation that ultimately stabs the album.
B000HT386M|4.0|I am a person who mostly avoids mainstream movies due to violence & Hollywood messages that don't match up with my values.  With that said, I'd have to say this movie was definitely worthwhile.  My husband convinced me to take a look & I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br />I won't repeat what others have said, but Click forces you to think about your own choices in life.  The simple message is this--appreciate people, not things.  Maybe that topic makes a lot of folks uncomfortable?  Not sure why else people wouldn't like the movie. <br /> <br />I say if you want a movie with a positive message & don't mind examining your own heart in the process, check it out.

1400034779|4.0|This little detective book isn't exactly a novel in the traditional sense, it's more of a collection of stories or cases that Precious, the detective solves.<br /><br />Precious is the main character and her voice and perspective are the best parts of the book. She's funny, has strong opinions and a strong moral code.<br /><br />In comparison to the tradional mystery novel, No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is much more literary than the usual fare. It's also less mysterious and slower paced.
B000J103X4|5.0|Anyone who doesn't like this album doesn't understand west coast rap, doesn't understand old school rap, doesn't understand gangsta rap.  The fact is, One Blood (the album's first single) is actually the worst song on this album, and that's a pretty good song. <br /> <br />I remember 50 Cent saying recently that Game's CD would prove that he is only a good freestyle rapper because he can't write a song about anything, which is funny, because the songs on this album are all ACTUALLY ABOUT SOMETHING REAL instead of just following the typical pop rap outline (sex, drugs, guns). <br /> <br />If you hear anything about this album not being good because of the absence of Dre, just ignore it.  Every producer on this CD OUT-PRODUCES DRE.  People who say the producers are just trying to imitate Dre don't know a thing about hip-hop production and the styles of Scott Storch, Just Blaze, Will.I.Am, JR Rotem, and Hi-Tek.  Every producer stays true to his style and each beat stands out as perhaps each producer's finest contribution to rap music. <br /> <br />1. Lookin' at You - Fine track.  When I first heard it I was like \\"Damn, Game's back, west coast is back, this is gonna be hot.\\" (9/10) <br /> <br />2. Da S*** - One of my favorites.  Beat is pure west-coast, Game shines.  (10/10) <br /> <br />3. It's Okay (One Blood) - Once again, I said this was the worst song on the CD, but its still an dope as hell. (8.5/10) <br /> <br />4. Compton - Old School sounding drums, creative instrumental produced by Will.I.Am.  Certainly deserving of the title as Compton's hood anthem.  (9.5/10) <br /> <br />5. Remedy - Game actually sounds like he's gone back in time to 1988 and he's an original member of NWA here.  Straight up old school.  Catchy beat, Just Blaze proves his versatility.  (9.5/10) <br /> <br />6. Let's Ride - 2nd single.  Fly as hell.  (9/10) <br /> <br />7. Too Much - Another Scott Storch beat.  Catchy as usual.  Bangin as usual.  (9/10) <br /> <br />8. Wouldn't Get Far - Another top notch beat from Kanye with a great concept.  Game actually writes a catchy 50-like hook.  Kanye raps as well and, although I'm not a fan of his lyrics all the time, he does real well here. (8.5) <br /> <br />9. Scream on Em' - Banger.  I've come to expect beats this dope from Swizz Beats at this point, but this one definitely stands out.  Again, Game with a catchy hook and powerful lyrics. (9/10) <br /> <br />10. One Night - Perfect example of Game's songwriting skills that 50 claimed he did not have.  Game raps about homies from back home and how they've turned their back on him.  Just a great song. (9.5/10) <br /> <br />11. Doctor's Advocate - Game with a rare humble track about parting with Dre.  The beat is some tight s***.  The guy who sings the hook just solidifies this track as a classic. (10/10) <br /> <br />12. Ol' English - Classic, classic, classic, classic.  Ice Cube's \\"Today was a Good Day\\" 2006... but better.  Game's best lyrics so far in his career.  I think this is my favorite song ever. (10.5/10) <br /> <br />13. California Vacation - Crazy s***.  Straight west coast s***.  Flat-out banger.  Snoop and Xzibit prove they can still spit.  Love this track.  Should be a classic. (9.5/10) <br /> <br />14. Bang - Solid track.  Kurupt and Game flow nicely.  Again, mad west coast.  (8.5/10 <br /> <br />15. Around the World - Jamie Foxx sings, which I usually don't like cuz I'm all about gangsta s***, but he does real well here.  Nice track, more for the ladies. (8.5/10) <br /> <br />16. Why You Hate the Game - Produced by Just Blaze, feat. Nas.  Another classic.  This is better than Hate it or Love it and that's one of the best rap songs.  Great way to end the album. (10/10) <br /> <br />The point is, Game doesn't need Dre or 50 cuz he's better than both of them combined.  The way I see it, the more independent he becomes, the better he will be.  Can't wait for LP #3 but for now I'm gonna bang this CD for 2 years straight.  I don't know if I can listen to any other rap besides this with the crap we've seen come out these days. <br />
0452282152|4.0|\\"The Girl with the Pearl Earring\\" tells the story behind the relationship between Vermeer and his subject, his maid-the girl Griet. Like the painting, the story is simple, subtle and strangely intimate.<br /><br />Upon picking up Chevalier's novel, I thought it might be slow and boring. Thankfully, despite the delicate prose, the novel moves along at a steady pace and at times the novel is so silent and intense-like a cat on the hunt- I had to hold my breath. The novel is the perfect length and Chevalier skillfully mixes character, art, plot and 17th century Holland into a tight novel.
B000000WHC|5.0|He is what he is. Is he Blues? Is he Rock? Is he Heavy Metal? Gary says he's \\"Still Got The Blues\\", and I am not gonna deny him his pain. I like this kind of blues as opposed to \\"my baby done left me\\" (wa-wa-wa-wa-WA!) \\"she ain't comin' back\\" (wa-wa-wa-wa-WA!) Know what I'm saying? Gary plays some intense guitar folks. The title track contains some serious, serious guitar. Those who don't show Gary love, and would like Gary to \\"calm down\\" probably wish they could play like he does. Good CD. Find it and buy it.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|This movie may look interesting, but it is incoherent and trivial. Not really worth watching.
B00005NB8K|2.0|This film is a poor take on Jim Morrison's life.    I suggest picking up \\"Riders on the Storm\\" by John Densmore or \\"Light my Fire\\" by Ray Manzarek, both books have their personal accounts and are much more interesting.     I mean if you're gonna just make up scenes at least do it for the benifit of the audience and the person you're portraying.  At least show a little of Jim Morrison's good side and not just jimbo.     <
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Witty, endearing series. Great character development. Overall, very addicting! And you don't have to be female to appreciate it.  <br /> <br />Note: These early seasons are the best. The later ones are still good, but the plots just get more and more convoluted because the producers want to keep making episodes.
B000096BLG|4.0|This album was recorded in Australia, oh so many years back, and I was fortunate enough to be sitting about 10 feet away from Michael Franks and Crossfire (an amazing Sydney-based jazz fusion band who often accompanied visiting musical royalty)during one of the gigs at which some of the tracks were recorded. Jim Kelly, the guitarist, is pretty near my favourite guitarist of all time and the whole band cooked on that night. Sadly, Crossfire disbanded many years back but Jim is teaching music in the Southern Cross University, Lismore, NSW, Australia and maintains a prolific output of music with various projects he is involved in.
B00094OB1Q|4.0|The review below seems dead on target about the pluses and minues of this recording, but I'm not sure, once they are balanced out, that Bohm's 1969 Fidelio deserves highest praise. Gwyneth Jones, even in best voice, is an acquired taste. She manages to be much steadier and mellifluous than later on in her career--I've always wished she could have substituted for Gundula Janowitz in Bernstein's Fidelio recording, also from Vienna on DG, since Jones possessed a true dramatic soprano. Bohm doesn't give her much inpsiration to be dramatic, however. His conducting throughout is traditional, correct, and plain.<br /><br />The opera world is always short of heroic tenors, and by today's standards James King would rank behind only Ben Heppner. He has a powerful, ringing voice, but it's used with little imagination. He's sturdy but not at all moving. I prefer Patzak, Vickers, and Mc Cracken on competing sets; it would have been nice if King, too, could have replaced Rene Killo under Bernstein's inspired direction. All the secondary roles are very well sung. I know I sound tepid in my recommendation, but this bargain set beats out many ohters overall. Among full-price versions in stereo, the Klemperer, Karajan, and Bernstein sets remain untouched.
B00005RG6B|5.0|This is one of the best concert dvds I own.  It is a must have for any queensryche fan.  The audio and video are both great.  Geoff tates' vocals are outstanding.  As is the rest of the band.  I defenitely recommend picking this concert up!
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|My Chemical Romance first release was an album filled with well written material.  Its an album I can listen to everyday and not really get tired of the music.  Their new album The Black Parade is a distinct follow-up.  Its dark theme is wonderfully beautiful. They have an ability to mix a number of different styles to create a sound to set them apart. Songs are catchy but filled with content. This group can really write lyrics but back it up with complex compositions.  I watched them perform live on the Music HD channel a few weeks ago and their guitarist is very impressive. He is not some chump relying on a studio to create magic.  My Chemical Romance has true talent.  I highly recommend this album.  I see more great music coming from them in the future.
B000002JSJ|5.0|If I had to choose only ONE Zep album to listen to for eternity, Presence would be it. I believe this album was the group's zenith. The styles and sounds that were introduced on Presence would later echo in Robert Plant's solo material, of which I'm a huge fan. The downside of Zep albums such as Presence and In Through The Out Door are that they make earlier Zep albums sound dated and a bit primitive (yes, I'm talking about Runes, gasp!) <br /> <br />Anyway, what else can I say to get you Dear Reader to listen to this fine record? There's a secret backward message in Candy Store Rock? LOL
B000GCG59W|5.0|I was in Spain and it was late at night.  I was scrolling through channels on the television and I came upon a live concert of various flamenco musicians.  Enters Concha Buika . . . I was quite unprepared.  I was so moved that I couldn't stop talking about it for days.  Riviting!! absolutely riviting performance! and it's the first time I've ever used that word.  She  is probably the most unique and fantastic singer/musician I have ever encountered.  Her voice is a natural instrument so fine, so beautiful and rich that it's difficult to believe that she's only human.  Many flamenco artists had performed, all great.  But, when Concha took the stage her intrinsic beauty alone was so stunning that everyone was immediately captivated.  Then she began to sing . . . it was devastatingly beautiful!!!  Something so magnificent and pure that she floored the entire audience.  When her set was finished there was a brief silence as everyone collected themselves, then a standing round of applause that must have gone on for five minutes.  Absolutely remarkable!! She redefines the word rare.
B000IOM1RI|4.0|I love this CD although not many people seem to totally love it.  As other people said, its a soundtrack but it's still a CD with original music.  \\"Master Exploder\\" \\"The Pick of Destiny\\" \\"The Government Totally Sucks\\" \\"Kickapoo\\" and \\"Classico\\" are the best on the CD.  And if you fail to remember they are pretentious because thats how the movie was written.  It was supposed to act like they are rock gods and something special.<br /><br />Mostly this album is more polished and sounds more like a CD because there is only music and clips from the movie.  They also worked harder on the metal aspects.  A lot more metal sounding elements and great singing by Jables and Kage sounds much improved on the guitar.  I wish it was longer then 30 minutes but take what you can get.<br /><br />Ill be there at the first showing of The Pick of Destiny!  Its going to be amazing and Ill have all the songs already learned!  I suggest picking it up because its worth listening.
0743289412|3.0|I think Stephen King is a great author, perhaps one of the best of era.  I also don't care much for his genre of writing.  This means I'm very choosy about the King books I read.  I haven't tried much of his horror works and don't plan too.  Lisey's Story is his latest novel and is about a widow, Lisey Landon, still mourning the loss of her husband two years after his death.  Scott Landon was a famous Pulitzer Prize winning author who had a troubled childhood and a tormented past.  The book really is about Scott's past, the way he dealt with it, and Lisey's transformation into a believer in everything Scott believed.<br /><br />The book is hard to read.  The story is written as if every single thought Lisey has is put on the page, so there isn't a smooth flow to the story.  The novel is full of peculiar sayings that only Lisey and Scott or Lisey and her sisters are familiar with.  The action is slow, revolving around a stalker wanting to at first gain access to Scott's notes and old stories, then to just eventually kill Lisey.  Lisey also has to deal with her sisters, one that is crazy, and the others her have their own peculiarities.<br /><br />You'll read many references to this book being a \\"love story.\\"  I wouldn't call it that.  It is more of the story of a journey of a relationship, from the beginning to the end.  The actual story is Scott's tragic past, and the stalker after Lisey.  Scott has a special place he goes called Boo'ya Moon, which is featured quite prominently in the second half of the book.  Some will like this, some won't.  I enjoyed it, but didn't really buy into it because it didn't in anyway tie into reality.<br /><br />If you're a King fan, then of course you should read this book.  If you're considering King, then I'd perhaps find another book that is easier to read.  The Cell, released recently, is a good King book that reads more like a standard thriller.  This book doesn't technically have any horror aspects, but the childhood of Scott and his brother Paul is one of the saddest things I've ever read.f Scott and his brother Paul is one of the saddest things I've ever read. <br />
B00076NYFU|5.0|I am a huge Status Quo fan, I barely remember purchasing the \\"LP\\" back in the 70's. The remastering of this album is great & I love this cd!

B000CE9R26|5.0|In 1984, Donna Summer released her fourteenth album entitled, CATS WITHOUT CLAWS. This is yet another overlooked, underrated album. This album is very clever and brilliantly produced. Just the sound of the album's title is awesome. <br /> <br />SUPERNATURAL LOVE <br />  The first single from the album. Awesome tune. <br /> <br />IT'S NOT THE WAY <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />THERE GOES MY BABY <br />  The second single from the album. This is a great cover of the old 50s song. You know, the one that was played in THE SANDLOT, when Squince sees Wendy Pephercorn walking down the street. <br /> <br />SUZANNA <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />CATS WITHOUT CLAWES <br />  An awesome title track. <br /> <br />OH BILLY PLEASE <br />  When I read the title of this song, I didn't think I was gonna like it, but after hearing it for the first time, it became an instant favorite of mine...well, one of my favorites. <br /> <br />EYES <br />  Great. <br /> <br />MAYBE IT'S OVER <br />  Great. <br /> <br />I'M FREE <br />  Don't like it. <br /> <br />FORGIVE ME <br />  Great. <br /> <br />     Why so many people are overlooking most of Donna Summer's albums of the '80s is something I cannot figure out. This is a great album, with the exception of one song. I wish people would be more open-minded to things.
B0009A40ES|4.0|Bale shines in this here doozy of a cinematic tresure. One of the better black comedies with brutal horrific elements, American Psycho should strike a chord in many.<br /><br />Though it pokes fun at the 2nd greatest US president (Reagan), I couldn't help but nod my head in approval as the director brilliantly expressed her erroneuous views through this artful unfolding of a plastic man.<br /><br />Haven't read the book, but will certainly pick it up sometime soon as this film which should appeal to horror fans as well as indy film lovers and anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humor, is a memorable one for sure.

B000IU3Y3W|3.0|Truth is that Crazy Horse was a really awful band that occasionally rose to the moment. This is one of those moments, but the release, all digitized and separated beautifully in a sparkling mastering, is something short of what it purports to be. For reasons best known only to Ol' Shakey himself, Young has decided not to release the full shilling, in fact not even the full electric set. That's a pity. Honest. I was at the show, and the first set was an acoustic wonder, the second set was, except for \\"Wonderin'\\" and \\"Let's Go Downtown,\\" a thing of awesome power. It was quite a night. Steve Miller had opened with a respectable run through of his hit and a few other tunes. Miles Davis came on next and totally bewildered a crowd completely unprepared for his abstract explorations (but wonderfully captured in a Legacy edition). Then after all that Dark Prince funk, Young walks out with an acoustic set of familiar and brand new tunes that would have been worth it all by themselves. This set has been bootlegged most notably on the YOUNG MAN'S FANCY record. From \\"Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing\\" to the rousing \\"When the dream came\\" from his Buffalo days, Young was amazing. A brief intermission and the Crazy Horse contingent plugged in and launched into \\"Cinnamon Girl\\", most of \\"Everybody Knows...\\" lp, \\"The Loner\\", \\"Mr Soul,\\" and more. <br />What you have here then, is considerably less. And to skip anything that was omitted to include \\"Wonderin'\\" and \\"Downtown,\\" well, only Neil would make that call. He must still feel remorse and guilt about Whitten. \\"Downtown\\" is a pretty crappy song by any standard and the only reason anyone took notice of these guys is that Young liked them. So, if it brings Whitten's relatives a royalty, I shouldn't grouse. Too much is made, though, of the interplay with Young on guitar - Whitten isn't that great. He is certainly no Frank Sampedro (yikes), and Crazy Horse on their best night has never measured up to Chad Cromwell, Rick Rosas, Ben Kiethand Spooner Oldham, but these were heady days way back when, and what is clear is that Young knew that regardless of the garbonzo talent behind him, he had to make this count. <br />And he does. With fire. The renditions of \\"Everybody Knows\\", \\"Winterlong\\" and \\"Cowgirl\\" are definitive, especially \\"Cowgirl.\\" He's never played it as well.  <br />So, I am hoping that this is not an auspicious mist-step to the fabled Archives releases. With Young, who knows? Pity he doesn't take apage out of the Pearl Jam book and offer downloads in FLAC or crappy MP3. He must have lumps of tapes out in the shed somewhere. Personally, I'd love to get a good sounding rendition of the TIME FADES AWAY tour stop in Philadelphia. Until the recent CSNY Freedom Of Speech Tour, it was the very best concert I ever attended. And as I've come to expect with Neil, he opted for bits and pieces of a truly awful outing from LA as his official release. You get used to it after a while.... <br />For this, I'd say it was worth picking up. Maybe Neil will figure things out one day. Way back when he was out to prove something about his art. Wish he'd share some of that.....
B000I5X80G|3.0|I have listened to this CD quite a few times now. The previous reviews are just gushing. As for me, its a novelty. Did I enjoy listening once? YES. Does it make me want to play it again and again? NO. The sound quality is great. BUT....extended bombastic guitar solos just dont do it for me. This kind of music was an extension of Iron Butterfly's INNA GADDA DAVIDDA and set the stage for numerous extended solo early 70's jam bands. Listen , enjoy it but I doubt if you will play it over and over
B00005JOCU|3.0|Saw a preview last night.  Great production values, show-stopping performance by Jennifer Hudson.  Eddie Murphy terrific. Jamie Foxx one dimensional.  Beyonce good, Anika likewise.  A little long at 125min. <br />Fun for those of us who lived through the '60s and '70s.  Music had me movin' in my seat and who-whoing.
B000IOM1RI|3.0|Tenacious D has been steadily gaining popularity in recent years thanks to Jack Black's movie success and the inevitable P2P networks that exist on the Internet.  Their first album was clever and funny, but even though they claimed they were the best band in the world, it didn't seem like they let their proclaimations get to their head.  With Tenacious D starring in their own movie and with their popularity at an all-time high, all the talk has gotten to their heads.  This record is simply not as good as their debut, and there is an almost palpable pretentiousness associated with it.  The only song that made me laugh on the first listen through was \\"Classico,\\" a quick run through of a few classical snippets with JB's nonsensical lyrics and scat thrown overtop. <br /> <br />If you're a diehard fan, you will find something to like here.  They still  have their distinct sound, but it just doesn't feel the same anymore.
B000E6GBV2|5.0|I caught BOH live at Neumo's in Seattle at their show that I was attending to see Sera Cahoone (who is their ex-Carrisa's Weird bandmate and also drums on this album). I had no expectations when they started playing and was initially a bit distracted. The honest and infectious energy of singer Ben Bridwell contributed to the atmosphere of their set but the superb musicianship and classic songwriting had me and the entire crowd captivated. I bought the album the next day and have yet to tire of it. Although there are definite tones of Mercury Rev, My Morning Jacket (reverbed vocals), Flaming Lips and Built to Spill, BOH are a quintessentially Seattle band. Their blend of Seattle alt. country, classic rock and indie rock makes for an album that, if you don't understand it, is truly a remark more on your taste than the quality of the band.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|This movie is a must have for all family libraries. It appeals to adults and youth alike. A true feel-good movie about how we are all the same inside, no matter what our outward differences are. Really teaches the lesson, \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\".
B000GDH9AA|5.0|Clapton is at his absolute best when he is playing live. He never plays the same solo twice. So I really enjoy listening to his live recordings the best because I never know how he's going to play a song on any given night. This recording captures one of Clapton's shows in the late eighties. It's a great listen for the true fan of Eric Clapton.
0618680004|5.0|A superb book. The cretins below who attack Dawkins for being fundementally intolerent of religion miss the point. As was writen wonderfully elsewhere: <br /> <br />I think it would take just a single change to world culture: the end of knee-jerk deference to religion. That would mean: <br /> <br />No more looking the other way when myth is presented as equal or superior to fact <br />No more looking the other way when parents and communities brainwash their young with reality-distorting dogma <br />No more tongue-biting when religion leads to holy wars, terrorism, serial child abuse, and bigotry <br />No more governmental assistance in marketing religion, be it \\"In God We Trust\\" on the currency, oaths sworn on bibles, letting theocrats alter the Pledge of Allegiance, or tax breaks for churches and temples. <br /> <br />That is what we, Atheists, ask. If the above were implemented - if religion were scrutinized as it should be, if it were forced to survive on its own merits - it would crumble up and die and for good reason. Because it is a fraud, and a poison, and not sustainable on its own merits.
B00005KIVN|5.0|This is not a movie. You don't watch x amounts of minutes and get up and go home (or leave the room). This is a film. This will leave the  the room with you. This will stay with you and haunt you.  It will get under your skin and it will become a part of you. This is what makes a film as opposed to dribble entertainment. Brilliance needs not a large budget. Perhaps lesser films need lots of it  to fill the nonsense.  Sally Potter's writing and directing is brilliant. Pable Veron is superb. All of the actors are real. Tango to make you fall in love, music to fill your soul.  if you are prepared to take real film making serious, watch. For mindless entertainment the other selections are  beyound counting.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is a inspired film with a lot of heart and passion. In between the eye popping colorful visuals, elaborate costumes is a timeless story about artists and writers trying to maintain their artistic integrity. Even though Moulin Rouge is set in the 1900 France, this 2001 musical farce had some wonderful parallels to the creative process in modern-day Hollywood.<br /><br />On the surface Moulin Rouge is the story of Christian, a struggling poet from England who has never experienced love. He travels to France to join other writers and be part of the Bohemian revolution transpiring there. (Parallel to today's inexperienced New York writer who travels to Hollywood) Through a series of flukes (a guy falling through his ceiling) he finds himself working with a group of actors and writers trying to develop a play Spectacular Spectacular. One night they all head down to the Moulin Rouge, a nightclub. The actors have set up a meeting between the Christian and Satine, a beautiful actress who they want to star in their play. She's supposed to meet with a rich Duke and fall in love with him but Through a series of more misunderstandings with a handkerchief, she winds up meeting with the Christian first and tries to seduce him to get the part (A terrific statement about the casting couch) She falls in love with him, but When the Duke arrives They all have to put on a show to get his financial support for the play Spectacular Spectacular. What's funny is that they make up the premise for the play off the top of their heads. (Parallel to today's Hollywood Pitch meeting) I won't give up any more; this movie is too good to spoil.<br /><br />I'll just say this: people will come away with their own unique opinion about this movie. I also recommend watching it twice to get a full understanding of the movie. Moulin Rouge is multileveled; its' not just a musical. It's a farce, a comedy and a romance making commentary about the creative process. Yes, a lot of the songs are from the seventies and eighties, but it makes sense in the context of the story. These bohemian artists are making art that's ahead of its time and most people in that era would never understand it. To people in that era it's just noise, while to us these are classic songs.<br /><br />The acting in Moulin Rouge is Spectacular Spectacular. Ewan McGregor gives one of his best performances as the Christian. He disappears and all you see is the struggling man trying to make a statement with his writing and preserve the love he shares with Satine. Nicole Kidman steals the movie with her incredible performance as Satine. Singing dancing, you can't take your eyes off her. She has incredible chemistry with McGregor and you feel the love between them.<br /><br />Director Baz Luhrmann makes a one-of-a-kind cinematic masterpiece. It's truly a work of art onscreen. The elaborate sets and over-the top circus like atmosphere from his imaginative visuals create a mood of surrealism that makes everything in the movie feel like a dream. His shots have a lot of detail but are never overwhelming; it was easier for me to follow the story of Christian and Satine. He should have gotten an Oscar for best director and this film should have won for Best Picture. It's one of the most original films I've seen in years.<br /><br />Moulin Rouge is a Shawn James Five Star Essential video.

1400097029|1.0|I bought this book because it had the Booker sticker, a beautiful cover and it was by an Irish writer, all good indicators. The book is 185 pages that seem like 500. It is well written, and knows it is, and unengaging. Here are its basic problems:    1) The main character is totally, completely and absolutely dull and unsympathetic. Who cares about him and his memories of the drowning of someone he had a crush on? He is an unimaginative, cold, self-involved and thoughtless little person but he is not so much so as to be interesting. Sometimes writers who do nothing but write forget that their inner experience just isn't compelling to people who live a life that is engaged with others and with the world.    2) It is well-written but knows it is. There are needless passages which look at themselves and seem say \\"gosh, that's good writing\\". These passages come off as precious grad school passages. They describe in manicured poetry the uninteresting thoughts of an uninteresting character.     3) Our experiences are not interesting just by virtue of having them. Beautiful, heart string writing don't make them more interesting, it just says to the reader \\"I can write\\". But there are many human stories that are very compelling ...     4) It's a memory, not a story. That's really really a problem for the poor reader.
B00005JNS0|5.0|The word for \\"Cars\\" is WOW!What a brilliant triumph!This is Disney/Pixar at its peak.John Lasseter and his colleagues are the best at what they do,and this visually stunning masterpiece shows it to perfection.The animation artwork here is the best they have ever done(those shots of the mountains are breathtaking!).Under Lasseter's magnificent direction,they have once again brilliantly succeeded in combining artistry with a wonderful story and a delightful cast of characters(Owen Wilson and Bonnie Hunt are terrific,but Paul Newman and Larry The Cable Guy steal it!).This is perfect entertainment for everyone!Sit back and enjoy!
B000ICM5VW|4.0|I loved the first King Kong movie in black & white.  But this movie was for me more enjoyable because of the special effects.  The dinosaur fights were excellent.  I loved the developement with King Kong as having a personality and the interaction between him and the girl.  She even uses her vaudville act on Kong and he pretends to not be ammused but she wins him over eventually.  Black is OK as the promoter of the adventure to find the mysterious island.  He is a bit of a ham and overacts at times but that is his nature.  He acts with the intensity of a Tom Cruise but just doesn't have quite Tom's magnetism.  I would have given the movie 5 stars but they could have cut short the human eating giant insect scene in the chasm.  The scene lasted over ten minutes (or seemed like it) and makes the movie out of reach of most children to enjoy. The old King Kong was accessable to all age groups something lost in this new one.  However I still loved this movie.
B00008I8IF|4.0|I had not purchased a Jayhawks cd since Hollywood Town Hall.  I honestly thought the Jayhawks couldn't be as good with only half the songwriting duo of Louris/Olsen.  Then I started hearing great things about Rainy Day.  Now that I have it, I can't get it out of my CD player!      The first half is definitely stronger but there is no filler.  Even some of the tracks that lag in the second half of the disc are redeemed by the layered instrumentation, great harmonies and catchy choruses (Ethan John's fine production is felt throughout).      This could have been a late 60s Byrds album, and a fine one at that (the verses to \\"Tailspin\\" are indeed reminiscent to \\"My Back Pages\\").  Gary Louris has written a fine batch of song.  Just when you think the cd might not close strong, \\"Tampa to Tulsa\\" brings the songwriting quality back to the level where it started.      Gary Louris has been working with original Jayhawk Mark Olsen recently, so hopefully this is not the last we've heard from this band.
0141439688|4.0|Persuasion was Austen's last completed novel before her death and was written whilst the novelist was dying, which may explain its shorter length when compared to her other novels.  Although briefer in the telling, it lacks none of the hallmarks of Austen's style including the omniscient ironic (and sometimes in this work cynical) narrative voice and her witty yet extraordinarily subtle comments on her societies approach to women and the social hierarchy.  The action of this novel centers on the character of Anne Elliot who under the influence of a close family friend, Lady Russell is persuaded to reject the advances of Wentworth.  The main body of the plot takes place eight years after this rejection; Wentworth is now known as Captain Wentworth and has made his fortune through the collection of enemy booty in the Napoleonic Wars.  Now with England in peace he has returned ashore seemingly having forgotten Anne and his rejection and ready to take a wife.<br /><br />As the romance unfolds the novel covers a number of themes, for instance the idea of being `persuadable' per se.  Initially the notion that Anne allowed herself to be won over by Lady Russell's influence is seen as a fault, however as the story progresses the sub plot involving the character of Louisa Musgrove shows that rather than being a fault, Anne listening to Lady Russell's advice shows that she is susceptible to reason and practicality.  Seemingly the error occurred rather in Lady Russell's judgment of Wentworth than in Anne's decision to follow her advice.<br /><br />Lady Russell's preference for Mr Elliot Jnr as a more suitable marriage partner for Anne over Wentworth seems to be based solely on the class distinction that divides these two men.  This class based prejudice by Lady Russell may be regarded as a critical reflection upon Austen's society which closely associated (and often without valid cause) moral virtue and class status, the assumption being that the higher your class, the better your moral decency.  The reader discovers the error of Lady Russell in relying on such a system of character judgement as it produces such corrupt results.<br /><br />Possibly the greatest achievement of this work is the very quiet proto-feminist message that Austen manages to slip into one of the closing chapters.  Every the ironist, Austen has the meek Anne Elliot, who seemingly conforms to all of societies rules about what a women `ought to be' speak out against the confining nature of a woman's expected place in society.  When discussing the fate of love affairs between men and women, Anne argues that it is easier for men to forget as women \\"live at home, quiet, confined...You are forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change.\\"  Anne then goes on to turn on its head Captain Harville's ideas that the supposedly stronger and more robust figure and mind of man is better capable for love than that of the mind of women.<br /><br />Austen's novels are never innocent of the issues which affected their period and this is yet another example as Austen deftly and subtly critiques gender roles, social class and the notion of `appearances.'  In its whole, this is a great book, perhaps the fact that it was written by an older and dying Austen may explain the nostalgic tone of decline or sadness that seems to pervade it.  It is well worth the money you would spend to buy it and the time you would take to read it.oral decency.

B0000042GM|5.0|Katchen's performace throughout this collection are excellent.Brahms integrates many of Schumann's,Bach's and Beethovens compositional ideas into his own works.He is a master of the appoggiatura(suspension of the dominant chord).And the ghosts of Bach,Schumann,and Beethoven appear at intervals throughout this collection of his piano works.The VARIATIONS ON AN ORIGINAL THEME is an ethereal experience,and the Op.09 VARIATIONS ON A THEME BY SCHUMANN, composed after his death,Brahms's pathos,especialy in the slower variations, make you aware of his sadness of Schumann passing, as there  is vivid sense of despair and remorse you can hear throughout.It is well documented the profound influence Schumann had on Brahms's compositional process.OP.76 is a passionate performance by Katchen.You also have short piano works culminated in Op116,Op 117,Op.118,which includes the great masterpiece in Ebminor,and Op.119.The Pagganini Variations,Variations on a theme by Haydn,the Ballads Op. 10.And both volumes of the HUNGARIAN DANCES,the 2 Rhapsody's,and VARATIONS ON A THEME BY HANDEL.It quite remarkable that such music could be created by such a young man in the astonishing Sonatas,OP.1,OP.2,and OP.5.The slow movements in all three sonates are very inspiring,and heart fealt.It makes you glad to be alive in order to hear such remarkable music.A well balanced performance throughout.If your a Brahms lover,this is a must for your collection.Enjoy
076790592X|5.0|I began by reading the cover with all the reviews, and thought \\"how could the book be THIS great?\\" They say its inspirational, and life-changing, and about an hour into reading this book, i learned how truly inspirational it was, and it made me reexamine my life and gave me a whole new appreciation for life and my family. This is a great book, not to mention an easy read. I was finished with the book after two days, and found MYSELF using words like \\"inspirational\\" and \\"life-changing\\" to describe the book to others. This is one of the best books I've read, and I would and do advise everyone i can to read this book and take in all it has to offer.
B0002O7XW2|4.0|this is one of my favorite john carpenter movies, second only to halloween. it is also one of my favorite stephen king stories, so i have no complaints on the movie itself. the only reason i give it 4 stars instead of five, is because once again sony has rereleased a movie without given it the treatment it deserves, (at least as far as sound goes.) the picture looks fine, but there is no change in the sound. a movie like this deserves DTS. it would greatly enhance the sound of the engine when christine is on her rampage, plus it would bring out john carpenters score. it seems like the only time sony releases a movie with DTS, is with their superbit collection, which would be just fine if you could choose what movies they release in that format. o well, hopefully they will start adding DTS as an audio option more often in the future, or bring back superbit, christine would greatly appreciate it, as well as legend of zorro, and underworld evolution.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I am a heavy metal rock musician with a penchant for sappy musicals. This movie is fantastic with the music cranking on the sound system. I watched it three out of the first four nights after I bought it. Campy? A little bit over the top? --- you bet. How can you have a horror story with everyone singing and not find it campy? I noticed that Christine was actually cracking a smile a couple times when she was suppose to show terror. That was great! <br /> <br />I saw the stage performance a number of years ago in San Francisco and thought it was pretty good. During the movie I felt as though the stage production had come alive and I was in some secret hidden spot, unseen by the cast and the rest of the audience. I remembered how the music filled the theatre and evoked a wide range of emotions. Ok...I admit it...I cried a bit during the movie. Big deal. It is funny, it is sad, it is exhilirating.  <br /> <br />You will read a lot of heavy criticisms of this movie, the music, and the cast...and they are right. You will also read a lot of gushing reviews of this movie, the music, and the cast...and they are right. It just all adds up to a must-see-for-yourself movie.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I have been waiting for a new album from Josh Groban since the last one came out. So my expectations were high for this one. I was not disappointed! Granted, there are a few songs that are not so great but there are at least 4 songs which are AMAZING! The first two songs, \\"Mai\\" in which his voice is at its best, and \\"You Are Loved\\" which is just a great song, are the best. \\"February Song\\" is such a smooth listen but it takes a time through to get it; it doesn't get you at first. It is a great album! I am a diverse music listener covering everything from 80's hair bands to Greenday to Josh Groban to Rascal Flatts and very few albums can I say I like at least half the songs. This album I like 8 out of the 12 songs and love 4 out of the 8. If you're a fan, his voice is like no other!
0060527986|5.0|\\"That is why he is a Warrior of the Light, because he has been through all this and yet has never lost hope of being better than he is.\\" -from the book.<br /><br />I love how this book shows the good and bad of our human nature and blesses it all. We all have within us the light and the dark. Which one will we allow to guide us? We are whole because of both.<br /><br />This book is encouraging and truthful, and full of wisdom. As you read this, you will take a look inside yourself and acknowledge what is there. This is a good book to keep out where you can pick it up and read something from it often. It's great to keep by your bedside for light reading before bed, or in the morning when you get up.<br /><br />\\"In order to have faith in his own path, he does not need to prove that someone else's path is wrong.\\" -one of my favorite passages from the book.<br /><br />I hope you'll read and enjoy this too!
B000I5X81K|5.0|I never write reviews, but this is an exception.  This album is truly unbelievable.  When I first popped the CD in and heard the song, \\"Don't Give Up\\", I could feel my eyes tearing.  Absolutely his best album to date and I have them all. Every song is magnificent, especially \\"February Song\\" and \\"I am not a Hero\\".  Again, truly unbelievable.  What a joy to listen to.
B000J103X4|3.0|I don't like typing up drawn out reviews so here u go.  I haven't reviewed \\"The Documentry\\" yet but I'll give it four stars.  If u liked that album and want to hear the same if not better beats and lyrics don't cop \\"Doctors Advocate\\".  I think all will agree the title of my review sounds familiar if u have the previous album.  Well try listening to that twice over and without the actually good rhymes that were in existence last time.  The production isn't bad but isn't as good this time around.  The Game should also stay away from doing his own hooks so much.  I really had high hopes for The Game as an artist, thinking finally a solid commercial rapper would change the \\"Game\\" a little for the good.  Sadly a sophmore slump can completely break a promising career.  Finally, I give this album 3 stars for the sake of production.
B000F48CD8|4.0|Seeing the raconteurs in concert is to understand why they exist.<br />They played a tight convincingly improvisational set opening for Bob.<br /><br />The eight-minute version of 'Bang Bang (My baby shot me down)' absolutely rocked. A bluesy 'level' and an intense 'broken boy soldier' rounded out the highlights. Brendan Benson silky voice plays very well off Jack White's snarl, particularly on the surprisingly excellent `together'; on the album version you can't really tell if they're kidding or not, in concert, they make you understand that they're serious.<br /><br />This is a very good album. A live album would be better.
B00003E43J|5.0|The original album had 12 tracks,an additional 6 tracks being added to make it up to cd value.This album is one of Elvis's seminal recordings.Elvis was not into album projects ,he would record a batch of songs usually from demos at a pre-arranged session.But this album has a coherence and track by track connectivity usually only prevalent in his gospel sessions. <br /> <br />Other tracks were recorded during the two to three days it took to put these songs together including one of his mega ballads.Just like he recorded Surrender during His Hand In Mine recordings and Love Letters with The How Great Thou Art batch of songs.Such was the nature and the genius of the man..he went with what felt right and what he wanted to sing <br />during these non film recording dates,during the latter he sang whatever Parker dictated for financial gain ,to hell with creativity,even if it was Old MacDonald Had a Farm with negative results for Presley's own ego,standing in popular music circles in mid 60s and his general wellbeing.
B000001ED1|5.0|This set is a case, unfortunately, of just not getting the attention the artist duly earned and Osborne has drifted into musical limbo, in my estimation, as a result. 'Relish' is an awsome collection of songs, and every bit the equal (as another reviewer remarks) of Morrisette's more highly rewarded and profiled,'Pill'. There are no weak songs on the list. There's real eccentric and daring bite to the vocals, the writing and the musical bent.
B000E6FSPW|1.0|Wow. Where do I start? I have all the Rocky soundtracks and this is by far the worst. It's horribly bad. All the '80s songs are dated and horrible. \\"Eye Of The Tiger\\" is recycled from Rocky III. There is NO Bill Conti music on this album. Did he want too much money? Maybe so. His absence is staggeringly obvious. Without Bill Conti's classical orchestrations and the famous Rocky fanfare, there is no real Rocky soundtrack. What we get here is a bunch of crappy pop-rock and some synthesized orchestrations by Vince DiCola that try to put an '80s spin on Bill Conti's work, to horrifying results.<br /><br />There are 2 good things about this album. One is that Frank Stallone is not on it. His laughingly silly contributions to Rocky III thankfully didn't get him invited back. The 2nd good thing is the James Brown song \\"Living In America\\". It's not great, but it's idly amusing enough to mention.<br /><br />Bill Conti is a bigger talent than Sylvester Stallone, and is therefore much more essential to the Rocky franchise. Both this film and its soundtrack are the worst of the series.<br /><br />If you want good Bill Conti music from Rocky, buy the 2006 remasters of Rocky and Rocky II.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I was born in 1972 and didn't come to know Van Halen until their album 1984 hit and I was starting to get into the Hard Rock scene. 1984 was a phenomenal album and I quickly scooped up all I could of Van Halen, even joined the fan club (of which my stepdad was upset because they used the F word in some of their literature). <br />This album single-handedly did for disco music (killed it) what Nirvana did for 80's hard rock music. This album is the father of 80's hard rock/heavy metal music. Yes, there were other influences no doubt but ALL radio-played bands from the 80's got their stuff from Eddie Van Halen. <br />There are really only a few revolutionary moments in rock history and this is by far one of the most recognizable ones. Sure, Dark Side of the Moon was a great album, and even the best-selling album ever, but it merely took the progressive/art rock form to new heights, it didn't change the face of rock music as a whole. <br />This album changed the landscape of the rock music world and it's form of rock held for over a decade. Even British and other European bands wanted to duplicate the Van Halen sound and techniques.
B000G759LW|5.0|I love how Christina takes on a completely persona every time she releases an album.  Some might be irritated by her constantly shifting musical style, but I think it's good that she experiments.  She's gotta find her groove!  Even though some of the songs weren't really early 20th century inspired, like she said, they're still good.  There are only a couple of songs I don't like too much on the whole album, which is pretty amazing.   <br /> <br />I also was happy to find a dedication from Christina to her fans, entitled \\"Thank You.\\"  I wish I could have participated in that song.   <br /> <br />Overall, Christina can no longer be shoved into that corner with Britney, Lindsay, and all the other crappy female singers out there.  She has true talent, and she isn't afraid to show it!  Go Christina!
B000JCETDS|5.0|Just picked this de-lux/limited edition copy of \\"the pick of Destiny\\" soundtrack. Man this thing rocks your f'n socks off right from the first note!!

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|As a newcomer to My Chemical Romance, I've been completely blown away by this CD.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that now I have to get all of their previous CDs because they're just too good.  There were quite a few CDs from my favorite bands that I was anticipating this fall, most of which were a total disappointment.  Thanks MCR, for giving us a worthy CD to listen to.  Flashes of Queen, The Killers (Hot Fuss-not the new horrible CD), Jimmy Eat World, even Rocky Horror Picture Show--I could totally envision a broadway show or movie for the theatrical quality of some songs.  Can't recommend it highly enough.
B000IOM0YM|4.0|I'm not the biggest KISS fan, but I do love collecting pop and rock DVD's of the artists of my youth.  I don't own any KISS CD's (except for their Millennium Collection), but I would have loved to see them live back when I was a kid.  As I started building my Rock DVD Repertoire, I was hoping there would be something filmed of KISS back in the seventies.  And so, here it is.<br /><br />It doesn't do any good to complain about the less-than-stellar video quality of these KISS concerts and interview footage.  This footage is mastered the best they possibly could.  I truly do believe this.  We didn't have High Definition cameras back then, but we do have the technology to moderately improve on aged film filed away deep in the storage vaults.  I'm pretty pleased with this.<br /><br />Unless, visitors from space came to earth to film KISS performing live (with their unearthly advanced technology), this is the best we're gonna get.  Maybe, someday, some space alien will bring us some of their film footage of KISS that their space traveling ancestors captured while secretly visiting us.  We'll see.  My brother-in-law has this old 8-track tape that some space alien gave to him as an apology for landing on his roof and tearing up his antenna, back in the early eighties, back in Detroit.  He knew they couldn't pay for roof repair and other various damages, but they did give him an 8-track tape that their elder ancestors gave them of Franz Liszt performing in Europe about a century or so before.  It's only playable on an old 8-tape tape player that we have to somehow jerry-rig to this old black and white TV.  This tape only works on TV's made before 1958.  Even though this old RCA TV is black and white, the Franz Liszt performance still comes through in color.  When we watch this tape, all the clocks in the house start moving backwards and the refrigerator power diminishes.  Plus, we learned that if we have more than three gallons of milk in the fridge, one usually explodes, which makes all the eggs float upward and just stick to the top surface.  But anyway...<br /><br />KISS is definitely something more enjoyable as a visual experience.  Musically, there is nothing too outstanding here.  I personally like Alice Cooper (musically) more than KISS, but KISS has a more demonic presence on stage.  Alice Cooper is rather comical and campy.<br /><br />I'm surprised that there isn't any kind of rock group out there today that hasn't tried to simulate the KISS concept.  Masks and make-up, and a great theatrical stage show, couldn't help but be an attraction to today's concert goers.  I would imagine with CD sales dropping, the best thing a rock group could do to sell itself to the buying public, is to create a great fantasy stage show.  You can't download \\"being at a live show\\".  Performing on stage is where the money's gotta be for today's rock artist.<br /><br />Anyway,  if you are even just a curious KISS fan, you won't be disappointed with this DVD.

B00006IU73|5.0|Definitely the best of Porcupine Tree so far, the depth of \\"Blackest Eyes\\" and creativity of \\"Trains\\" that I consider as one of the best tracks of the band, if not the best. If you want to introduce the band to someone; play this song first and last. \\"Strip the soul\\" and its great video are rare among rock bands. Such a great clip, I've only seen by Tool. \\"The Sound of Muzak\\" is another track that represents the band and its thoughts. This is a good gift for your friends if you want to introduce the band or listen to for the first time. \\"Heart attack in a lay by\\" is a descent ballad that is similar to others from the band and doesn't introduce anything new; however you'll like it :)

0596009208|5.0|This is an outstanding introduction to Java.  I've done VERY basic programming in procedural languages but had a need to get some object-orientation.  This book explained all the things that most other programming texts assume the reader knows and understands.  To top it off, it did it in an entertaining manner.   <br /> <br />The analogies are great and while the authors frequently repeat the same concepts several times, each time they do it from a slightly different angle.  I need the repetition so this method saves me from having to read the book multiple times. <br /> <br />I first purchased the Head First EJB book but the authors clearly point out in the early chapters of that text that you really need this book first.  They weren't kidding.  If you need to get from a complete lack of Java knowledge to  understanding EJBs, this book should come first, then the EJB book.  <br /> <br />I can only hope the authors will release a book on XML and Web Services.  That would complete me (for now). <br />
B000J103X4|5.0|As I normally do when i hear sophmore albums, i look for the pitfall. I fond none here. In fact Game manages to come with the type of swagger that makes you respect his hustle. Considering there are no Dre beats, the production on the album is serious. Is it better than DOcumentary? I beleive so!! Dont get me wrong The Documentary had its gems, but here on this new effort u hear more freedom in the production and songwriting skills. I'll say that my personal fav on the album is \\"why you hate the game(feat Nas). He not only hangs with him but manages to seal this album with a banger that not only is retrospective, but also special. If you love the ol skool dayz of NWA,  Dre, SNoop swagger. pick up this album you wont be dissapointed..... <br /> <br />p.s. im fron nyc so my opinion is not biased, i love all rap that is intriguing!
B000ICL3KG|2.0|As an environmental scientist, I find these soft-science/hardball political presentations of the global warming discussion distressing and unhelpful. While they rally the convinced, having partisan political types at the forefront of the discussion is probably unhelpful. To wit, about a third of this movie turns out to be a self promotion video complete with a replay of 2000 election footage.<br /><br />About the \\"movie\\": it's actually a filmation of the presentation Al Gore has made for some time on Global Warming. In it he tries to make the case that nearly everything we are measuring on this dynamic earth is the result of man-made CO2 and other green-house gasses. The audience is bombarded with a long series of charts, graphs, and suppositions that make for a compelling argument - IF one has little or no knowledge coming into the presentation.<br /><br />And this is where this production goes terribly wrong, the fact checking was terrible, the cherry-picked data was obvious and heavy-handed, and finally the movie ends up serving those who oppose any discussion of global warming more than it helps the cause. Two examples:<br /><br />An Inconvenient Truth asserts that a sea-level rise of 20 feet is a realistic short-term prospect - yet, the 2005 joint statement by the science academies of the Western nations warns of sea-level rise in the four to 35 inches range in the 21st century.<br /><br />Gore discusses the Earth's atmosphere as relatively thin, and declares that, \\"The problem we now face is that this thin layer of atmosphere is being thickened by huge quantities of carbon dioxide.\\" Hello? Thickness has nothing to do with global warming people. Carbon dioxide has molecular bonds that vibrate on the same wavelengths at which infrared energy radiates upward from Earth's surface - meaning that the vibration warms the CO2, which makes things hotter. Further the references to nitrogen are pure nonsense, since it doesn't play a role.<br /><br />My warning is to not let the politicians ruin the scientific process, no matter how noble the cause may be.g is to not let the politicians ruin the scientific process, no matter how noble the cause may be. <br />
B000IU3XU6|5.0|WOW, what else can be said. The first two CD's had songs that could send chills down my spine and make my hair stand up while I was driving. When I got the 3rd CD I was nervous if it could be anywhere near the first two. When I got up to the songs \\"don't give up\\" and \\"so she dances\\", spine chills started all over again. And this is coming from a guy here. A lady I work with listened to \\"so she dances\\" 4 straight times in her car and couldn't stop crying she said. This CD shouldn't be called \\"Awake\\". It should be called Amazing, because that is what it is. I look forward to seeing Josh again at the Garden in NY.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|The acting in this movie is AWESOME !!!<br />The film revolves around 4 people.<br />The characters are Ellen Burnstein (who plays the mom) Her son(Jared Leto), her son's best friend(Marlon Wayans), and her son's girlfriend(Jennifer Connely).<br /><br />The son and friend start out selling drugs, and become thier own best customers,the girlfriend also becomes addicted, followed by the Mom.She starts taking prescribed diet pills to lose weight, because she believes that she is going to appear on a talk show and wants to fit in a particular red dress, and her 'dieting' does start out innocent enough.<br /><br /> As this movie progresses we watch them become empty shells of who they used to be throughout a one year time period, as thier addictions progress.<br />(The film is shot in 4 parts, 4 seasons:Winter,Spring,Summer and Fall)It starts in the spring and<br />by the time Winter comes around, they are all living in thier personal hells as full blown addicts. Mom on her \\"legal\\" prescription speed, and the other 3 on Herion.<br /><br />The acting in this film is top rank.<br />I think it is right on the money the depths to which these four sink.<br />Addiction is not a pretty thing,and even though the empty shells of the addicts they become is disgusting to watch, it is also hard to turn away.<br /><br />The Mother's \\"bottom\\" that she hits in her addiction will make you cry, you just have to see it to believe it. And I felt the most sorry for her character too, because she was so naive' and  innocent when she began taking the prescribed diet pills, and because they WERE prescribed, she didn't see anything wrong with her use, and it continued until she was a raving lunatic at about 70 pounds, and getting shock treatments.<br /><br />We witness all 4 characters in thier spiral downward, and it is very sad to see.<br /><br />I will have to say that it is about the most depressing movie I ever saw, but this is not totally a bad thing, as there is a lesson to be learned, and that lesson is that no matter who you are,rich or poor, black or white, girl or guy: ANYone can become an addict.<br />Some make it back from the bottom, and others don't.<br />That is the reality of the situation, and this movie captures that perfectly.e, girl or guy: ANYone can become an addict.

B00000K3CR|5.0|I wholeheartedly agree with all of the glowing reviews on this site, and this movie is probably one of the most magical I have ever seen. However, the PG rating is because of some coarse language which Amazon does not mention specifically.  I watched it with my daughter when she was 8, and since I had seen the movie when it first came out many years prior, I couldn't recall exactly what was in it.  Well....it does have the F word and I believe also g-d-mn, so if you prefer that your kids not hear that kind of language in a movie you have chosen then you might want to hold off on this one for a few more years (although they may be hearing those words and worse on their school bus anyway). There is also a scene where the girlfriend comes to spend the night, her shirt gets unbuttoned and you see her bra....so just know that depending on your child's level of knowledge about sex, etc you may get questions you aren't ready for!<br />Other than this it is a terrific movie and definitely one of the most creative of Tom Hanks' career.
B00005K3NR|5.0|\\"Carrie\\" is...without a doubt THE best horror film ever made!!! Well,next to \\"Dressed To Kill\\" & \\"The Shining\\",of coarse. Sorry all you naysayers of The Shining,but it is a directors right,when they take a book and turn it into a movie,to figure out what they want to include and what they want to leave out. Well,enough of that,kiddies,let us get down to business.The second scene,after the opening scene of a volleyball game,is a slow motion scene of the girls leaving the shower,some of them are naked,like the very lovely Nancy Allen (whom I have had a crush on since I was ten!!) while the other girls are in various states of putting their clothes back on.Oh,yea...Amy Irving is also a longtime crush. The piano and strings that are played during this scene are just lovely.Pino  Donaggio sure composes interesting music. (The music that he did for 'Dressed To Kill' just gives me chills!!) The split-screen  technique during Carrie's \\"Rampage From Hell\\" towards the end of the film was used to perfect effect.Nice to see what kind of carnage is going on while at the same time we see Carrie trying to figure out where to direct her telekinetic rage next!! I love Brian DePalma's use of split-screen.DePalma,if your reading this,you are a true master of the horror genre!!! Some of the most terrifying scenes,i think are,When Sue Snell,in her dream leans over to put flowers on the lot where carrie's house used to stand and then Carrie's hand comes out through the rocks. That scene just creeped me out when I was a kid and it still creeps me out today.More creepy scenes are Carrie,with all of that pigs blood dribbling down. Talk about a truly terrifying vision from hell!! Carrie's mom,coming at her with knife in hand,the close up of the very creepy-looking Jesus-on-a-crusifix,and of coarse Carrie's mom waiting for her behind the door when Carrie goes upstairs....And that about wraps it up. Oh,yea,one other thing,with all of the interviews with some of the cast included in the extras,why didn't John Travota do an interview?? Sort of odd. Oh,well               Ira     Coos Bay,Oregon

B00005JPCA|4.0|I had a such a opportunity to see this film on Advanced screening presented by Sony last night. There have been very controversial and negative gossips and publicities about this upcoming film ever since Sony pictures announced Daniel  Craig for new James Bond.<br /><br />After the screening ended I felt very strange.<br /><br />Well, movie was great.  It has great physical actions, less explosions and CGI, and focusing on characters great plots, great lines with surprisingly great delivery.  It clearly portraits where James Bond was coming from.  So as sake of the criticism of the film, it was darn good film.  The movie was darker and more realistic than previous James Bond sequels, besides On her Majesty Secret Service (which is also great film)  but those elements made this film great.<br /><br />My cons on this film would be:  Daniel Craig's bodybuilders body.  I always except old-fashioned hero as James Bond with natural athlete's body.  Like Once Sean Connery possessed.  And he does not have cookie cutter elegance and charm of Bond.  It does not make him a terrible Bond just to be fair.  I just didn't like to see James Bond is transforming into something different.  Just because of movie got realistic and darker, it lost it's corniness and fantasy aspects of film which is the charm of the franchise, but I think it was inevitable to make this good film.<br /><br />For the best or worst, this franchise has evolved something different, and we all are gonna be judge of this updated Bond franchise..........
B000GY729M|2.0|What happened to the band that recorded \\"Hot Fuss\\"?  What happened to the electro-dance charged, hi-energy rock-poppy group that recorded \\"Somebody told me\\" and \\"Mr. Brightside\\"?  I remember in the press this band was hailed as the best British rock band to come from America.  This is definitely not the same band.  This group sounds like the E-Street band fronted by Robert Smith.  If you liked their last album, pass on this one.  If you dig more \\"adult-contempory\\" stuff, this may be right up your alley.  Not the worst album I've ever heard, but thank god for P2P (limewire/Kazaa/Bittorrent) else I may have been sukered into buying this one.  If you like the electro-dance punk sound go check out a band called \\"The Faint\\".

B000EDWKXI|5.0|I rented this film expecting from the reviews that it would be mildly diverting. In the event I found it laugh-out-loud funny: indeed I havn't laughed so much while watching a film for months if not years. And most of the time I was laughing with the film, not at it.    In more than one way this film was surprisingly similar to a film on the same subject which Bob Hope had made more than fifty years previously (Casanova's Big Night, 1954). In both cases the film is built around the same central joke, that Casanova's mere reputation as a great lover is enough to have every woman in Venice throw herself at him, including those who appear to be extremely respectable and virtuous, with precisely one exception - the woman he wants.    The quality of the acting, from the big names down to the complete unknowns, was superlative throughout - Heath Ledger in the title role and Jeremy Irons as Bishop Pucci, the inquisitor who is trying to hang Casanova, were particularly good.    The music, scenery and costumes were also fantastically beautiful. Venice is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and the production team made full use of this, both in the scenes which were shot on location and in the backdrops. The latter included some beautiful buildings which we can appreciate today only in the paintings of Canaletto and his contemporaries, but which have since fallen down or been demolished. Some of the scenes which were shot on location in Venice had to have the dialogue re-recorded in a studio and added back in, as the background noise was too loud and modern - the production team did a brilliant job of this.    The set up research for the background scenes appears to have been very thorough indeed. During the opening sequence Casanova's mother (Helen McRory) leaves Venice while he is still a boy. A panoramic view of Venice is seen behind her barge: the most prominent building in this view, the Campanile of the church of S. Maria della Carita, actually fell down in 1744, twelve years before the main action of the film, but it would indeed have been standing in Casanova's boyhood. I didn't spot it again in the backgrounds showing Venice in 1756, which suggests someone did some very careful work on what would and would not have been seen at particular times.    The musical soundtrack is wonderful, and all of the Baroque style of the period. Of course there is a lot of Vivaldi's music used, but there is also excellent music from many other 18th century composers including George Frederic Handel, Tomaso Albinoni, Corelli, and Teleman. The music track is almost worth buying the film for on it's own, though it is also available as a CD from Hollywood records, and if I don't decide to buy the film I will probably buy the music CD.    The plot is essentially a romantic farce which does not attempt to take itself too seriously. At several stages of the story Casanova appears to be in grave danger of being executed, but the viewer can assume that he will somehow escape, because the film opens with a very elderly Casanova finishing his memoirs. We hear the voice of the aged rake referring to the ten thousand women with whom he had affairs, and then reminiscing about the one love affair, back in 1756, which he has left out - the love affair of Casanova and Francesca.    Each of the characters bring their own brand of humour to the film, but the film seldom goes for more than a few moments without something to make you laugh. After Casanova escape from a nun's bedroom one step ahead of the Inquisition, the head inquisitor Dalfonso, (played by Ken Stott) scowls at the nun and exclaims \\"An eternity of damnation for one night with Casanova!\\" As soon as he has left the room she pulls a wry smile and says \\"Seems fair!\\"     Jeremy Irons as the far more dangerous Bishop Pucci who soon replaces Dalfonso, uses brilliantly dry understatement to underline the menace of his threatening statements, interspersed with throw-away lines. To make some of these work required equally brilliant support from Pucci's assistant Andolini, played by Ben Moor, who has to alternate from one moment to the next between playing Adolf Eichmann to Pucci's Reinhard Heydrich, and acting as Jeremy Irons' straight man.    Heath Ledger plays Casanova as a sophisticated English public school rascal, wonderfully supported by Omid Djalili as Casanova's servant and companion Lupo. I would suggest that Lupo is Jeeves to Casanova's Bertie Wooster except that Casanova, unlike Bertie, is the brains of the outfit. But the farcical scrapes they get up to are very P.G. Woodhouse.    Tim McInnery plays the Doge (ruler) of Venice so well that he finally banishes the ghost of Percy from Blackadder. I was unable to take McInnery seriously in some of his other recent roles because I kept thinking of his role as Edmund Blackadder's second hapless sidekick. However, this time, despite wearing a historically accurate costume which is as silly as anything he had to wear for the former roles, McInnery manages to summon enough gravitas to be plausible as the Doge. The Doge is Casanova's friend, but warns him that he will have to marry a respectable woman or leave Venice.     The apparently respectable virgin who Casanova decides to marry is Victoria Donato, played by Natalie Dormer. Her father is initially horrified when the notorious rake Casanova asks for the hand of his virtuous virgin daughter, and is about to refuse. However, as soon as she hears that Casanova has asked to marry her, Victoria throws respectability to the four winds and demands that her father accept the proposal. Natalie Dormer is a little under-used in this story, and her character is played strictly for laughs. But if she can reproduce in a wider range of contexts the performance she gives in this film, changing in a moment from the aspect of an innocent virgin to that of a woman who is positively smouldering with overwhelming desire, she is guaranteed a successful career om Hollywood.Unfortunately, Casanova has no sooner agreed his engagement to Victoria when fate throws the proto-feminist Francesca Bruni, played by Sienna Miller, in his path - and the fact that she despises him seems to make her irresistible to him. Most male viewers will wonder why Casanova would make such an effort to win the heart of a woman who loathes him, even if she's as beautiful as Sienna Miller, when he's about to marry a firecracker like Natalie Dormer's Victoria, but it's all part of the film's central joke.     There are too many other excellent performances in the film to list them all, but they include those of Lena Olin as Francesca's beautiful widowed mother, Charlie Cox as her brother, and Olver Platt as her fiancee, the wealthy lard merchant Paprizio.     Negatives - it's obviously not a very serious film. Apart from the costumes, sets, and music it bears very little resemblance to historical reality. Some viewers with a more sophisticated sense of humour will find this too farcical. Others who were hoping for something more risque might be disappointed by the fact that this film is surprisingly innocent and has very little nudity.    However, overall I would have to rate this as one of the funniest films I have ever seen and very entertaining indeed.
B000G8OZ02|4.0|Madeleine Peyroux comes across as an artist older than her years.  <br /> <br />Even though she is only in her early 30's, her music and voice sound like they belong to the previous generation.  <br /> <br />The fact that Peyroux's voice absolutely reeked of her Billie Holiday influences somewhat tarnished that breakthrough album \\"Careless Love\\".  <br /> <br />For her new album, \\"Half The Perfect World\\", she showcases the emotional core of songs by other singers and songwriters she's admired, and also displays her talents as a writer on four songs she co-wrote, keeping a distinctly romantic edge.  <br /> <br />The CD is slightly less heavy on the Holiday-isms but more intriguing in the song selection.  <br /> <br />For Peyroux tackles the love songs she loves, treating them to timelessly jazzy readings.  <br /> <br />Given the makeover are Johnny Mercer's \\"The Summer Wind\\", Leonard Cohen's \\"Blue Alert\\", Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\", Fred Neil's \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\", Tom Waits's \\"(Looking For) The Heart Of Saturday Night\\", Serge Gainsburg's \\"La Javanaise\\" and Charlie Chaplin's \\"Smile\\".  <br /> <br />The album conjures in the mind imagery of smoky bars, music lifted from the screen of an American feelgood movie. Drums are always light brushes, barely touching the skins, guitars light and fruity, clearly a double bass rather than an electric.  <br /> <br />No cutting edges are approached, no taboos challenged, but it is a pleasant amble through familiar territory.

B000IOM1RI|4.0|Yeah, the CD seemed a bit short, but what's there is very good. Some songs didn't grab me the first time around, but I'm sure I will enjoy them when they're put into context with the movie (this was the case for me with \\"Lee\\" and \\"Wonderboy\\" from the first album- once I saw the video and story, I LOVE the songs now). I only wish there was more more vocal harmony and more KG in general.
B000002JSJ|5.0|nbdy's flt but mine is the centerpiece that most have heard, but ax last stand is an epic unto itself, & tea is for 1 is simply a great blues-rock song with some of Jimmy's best playing
B000002H97|3.0|I'm not a hardcore Metallica fan. I like the musicianship on this album a lot, I like the vocal style, etc. <br /> <br />But the lyrics are painfully bad. The album sounds, for the most part, like something that a spoiled middle school brat would write. And the worst part is that most of the lame lyrics are in the popular songs, chiefly \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" and \\"Unforgiven.\\" In those two gems (musically, they actually are gems) we're treated to lines like \\"Couldn't be much more from the heart\\" and \\"You labeled me so I label you... I dubt the 'Unforgiven'\\" There are numerous other examples, but you get the point. <br /> <br />If lyrics affect your opinion of an album at all, you might want to read up on this one before buying it, because you'll actually feel your IQ drop if you sing along. If lyrics don't matter to you that much, then  you'll appreciate the musicianship and quality of this album.

B00005JPAD|4.0|The writing, character development and plot were excellent. Leo and cast were absolutely believable in their roles. Although, I must admit I would have liked to have seen Robert DeNiro play the crime boss' role. Him and Scorsese have always made a great combination. I have never really cared for Nicholson's acting and I felt that in some points of the film he was hammin' it up a little too much. Other than that and an unexpected ending this is a good movie to add to you collection when it released on DVD.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I have been a Josh Groban fan for many years, but this album is one of his best to date!  Every time I've listened to it, I've enjoyed it even more.  I feel like I've transcended to another world!   <br /> <br />Not only does he have a more eclectic mix of music in this CD, but he doesn't compromise his vocal style by adding unneeded extra notes nor techno gimmickry, and he SINGS those higher notes effortlessly without either straining or shouting (or - even worse - screaming).  And not only does he have a glorious voice, he sings these songs with feeling and passion. <br /> <br />Among some my favorites: \\"February Song,\\" \\"So She Dances,\\" \\"In Her Eyes,\\" \\"Solo Per Ti,\\" \\"Un Giorno per Noi\\" and \\"Weeping.\\" <br /> <br />Wonderful CD!  I highly recommend it!
B000I5X824|5.0|As soon as I heard this was going to be available on the 14th, I picked it up after work. The CD is AWESOME! I love the live acoustic cuts, and their cover of Comfortably Numb just blew me away! <br /> <br />If you are a Staind fan, or, if you never listened to them before, you MUST pick up this CD.
B000I5X80G|5.0|I have been looking forward to this CD, since I heard rumors of the release of Neil's archives probably a decade ago.  I was very excited a few months ago when I heard that Neil will release the material, one CD at a time. <br /> <br />As soon as I found this one in a store, I picked it up immediately.  And I have listened to it a half dozen times already.  It is fantastic: the driving guitar sounds of Crazy Horse, the magic of the original performance, the excitement of hearing some of Neil's classic songs early in his career. <br /> <br />I have read a few of the reviews of \\"fans.\\"  I don't understand--and being OCD I should--how grown people can speak of being \\"ripped off\\" or \\"disappointed,\\" because this CD does not have all of the songs of the original set at the Fillmore East.  They complain because of one song not being on the CD. <br /> <br />In the first place, this is Neil's artisitic material.  And in the second place, being a \\"fan,\\" I trust and respect his decision regarding how he wants to release it.  His musical skill, his artistic creativity, his perfectionism make me interested in his music.  The only promise Neil has to worry about is one that he obviously made to himself long ago, regarding the way he creates and releases \\"his\\" material without someone spoiling it when so-called experts mix it or put it together.   <br /> <br />I don't know a lot about Rock 'N Roll history, but I once read that Buffalo Springfield's first recording suffered because of those very issues.  I love the album in spite of everything I have read, and I hope that some of the archival material has some early studio and live things by Neil's first band.  <br /> <br />I own everything Neil ever recorded on vinyl, cassette, or CD, most things in all three formats.  I purchased everything in his catalogue a second time on CD, except for two albums not yet available.  I never felt \\"ripped off.\\" NOT EVER. <br /> <br />This CD is no exception.  You hear the early sounds of Crazy Horse with Danny Whitten, something I was ecstatic about getting and 46 minutes is plenty of material for me, although I would like to hear more. <br /> <br />I figure it this way.  I bought it.  I enjoy it.  I hope Neil will continue to release his material.  If I had to encounter the constant negativity from a minority of people who never will be satisfied with anything, I would not release a note for them. <br /> <br />Thank goodness Neil's music is about art and not about making a buck.  That's why people have so much passion for it.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|If Michael Mann was going to use this film to show all those wannabees over the past 20 years how it's done, based on his impressive TV series that made Michael Mann in this industry, this film wasn't it.  There's the title, the names of the two main characters, it was filmed somewhere that vaguely looked like Miami.  Other than that there was nothing that connected this weak movie to his original series.  This flim was an insult.  Unfortunately, the director insulted himself.  How weird.  As to the main actors, they just didn't fill the suits.  From the tabloids: 'Crocket' in this movie was played completely stoned drunk the entire shooting.  He checked into rehab immediately after filming ended.  If being drunk out of your mind is the only way he could capture the essence of this role, I pity him.  Otherwise, he looked like a bleached, sawed off, fancy dressed version of a mimic of a clown that tried in desperation to capture what the original Crockett brought every week to that great TV series.  The film's romance had no connection, no fire, no passion.  It's set up was completely unbelievable, and, it's ethnicity, considering the location - there are places in Miami that don't speak english, only spanish - was odd.  But finally, where did the budget go?  Mann used the same settings as backdrops for different unconnected scenes.  The opening sequence is confusing.  They meet up on a roof.  They drive off.  Their captain phones them to meet him at a special secret meeting place.  They meet him back on that same roof they left hours ago.  How weird.  My suspicion:  Colin drank the budget away, and Mann had nothing left to work with.
0670038040|5.0|This is one of the rare authors where I would have to say, even a \\"bad\\" Rumpole is a good Rumpole, but I have yet to read a \\"bad.\\"<br /><br />What I find the most intriguing about this, and the last, Rumpole novel, is, who has evolved more: Horace, Hilda, or Mortimer himself?<br /><br />I look forward, with eager anticipation, to more of Hilda's \\"memoirs,\\" and find it delightful that Bullingham (of all the horrid people!) appreciates her in the way she deserves.  (Making Horace, it would seem, appreciate her, too?)<br /><br />As to the plot itself: DId it sound a bit familiar, as if perhaps Mortimer has used this formula before?

B000GCFO0I|4.0|I knew the video game existed, but when I watched the movie, I knew nothing of the context.  I wondered if someone such as myself, someone without a reference point for the story and scenes, would enjoy the film as much as a lover of the game.<br /><br />The story concerns a young girl, Sharon, who sleepwalks and, during her somnambulism, mentions the name of a town: Silent Hill.  Her adoptive mother, Rose, desperate for an answer that therapy and medication have not provided, takes her daughter to the town, which has since been closed down due to the unstoppable coal fires that burn beneath it, the result of an obscure accident that occurred years earlier.  This accident, it turns out, created deep spiritual scars that reveal themselves when the town is, periodically, drenched in an explicable darkness.  (Don't let the name fool you; there's a lot of screaming and moaning going on in this so-called \\"silent\\" town.)<br /><br />The town, of course, is a pit of misery, horror, and demons.  Shortly after arriving, Rose loses Sharon.  She goes on a desperate search for her daughter, and finds, instead, shape-shifting demons, a constant rain of ash, and a scattering of dangerously fundamental townsfolk.  It turns out that Sharon doesn't need help.  Rose does.<br /><br />Rose is aided in her quest by a policewoman (the story is almost entirely about the curative faith and destructive hatred capable in women; the men in this film are portrayed as completely impotent; there could, in fact, be no male characters at all and the film would probably work just as well).  The policewoman, Cybil, follows Rose into Silent Hill, intending to pull the mother over for some crime which is unclear (Cybil's motivation is later explained, but it still does little to justify Cybil's actions at the beginning of the film as she chases Rose into the town; for that matter, it is unclear why Rose doesn't simply stop and explain herself to the cop).  When they find themselves stuck in this hell together, they join forces to find Sharon and escape.<br /><br />This movie is one of the most visually compelling horror films I've ever seen.  Sure, there's gore, but in spite of its staggering volume, it hardly ever seems gratuitous.  There are a few exceptions to this.  Near the end, a character is killed (surprise!) in one of the single most disturbing and realistic depictions of someone being burned alive that I have ever scene.  Also, the final Scene of Vindication (for whom, I won't say) is necessary, given the nature of the story, but it goes on far too long, and is filled with the sort of unending and benumbing graphic violence that the movie had mostly, up to that point, only artfully hinted at.<br /><br />The key word there is \\"mostly.\\"  This film is sure to offend and disturb more than a few viewers.  It's visceral cinematography is outstanding, but also truly gut-wrenching.  The squeamish should stay away.<br /><br />The acting and story, however, aren't bad at all.  And even if the story-line occasionally strays into Obviously-Based-On-A-Video-Game territory (Hello, Mazes!  Hello, Occasional Tricky Obstacles!  Hello, End Level Boss!  Power Up!), it is satisfying (in it's own right) for those viewers who aren't interested in role-playing games or first-person shooters.  Radha Mitchell is excellent as the desperate and horrified mother (although she does reprise a lot of the same facial expressions she employed in Pitch Black).  Laurie Holden (who appeared regularly on X-files) takes a little time to find her character, but once she does (taking off her sunglasses and that massive motorcycle helmet helps with this), she fills her niche nicely.<br /><br />I won't lie; although this film is mastefully done, its exquisite attention to detail sometimes comes across as over-the-top, and it can cause an emotional chasm.  I ended up being more intrigued by the film's limits and purposes than I was by the characters'.  This came flying back into my face in the movie's final moments, when character empathy becomes the most important element of the story.  Still, it's a balletic (and appropriately creepy) denoument, and, true to the title, it's pulled off without a word.most important element of the story.

B000002AT6|5.0|One of the things that bothered me a lot is that \\"Legends Of The Fall\\" was not nominated for an Oscar back in 1994-95, and I would have been more than happy if James Horner had won it for this beautiful piece of music, and not for \\"Titanic\\" three years later.  Not that the latter wasn't touching, but I think that \\"Legends\\" has more personality.<br /><br />Some people might say that Horner was channeling Aaron Copland, but to be honest, I simply don't care.  This is his best composition from his 90's output, period.  I mean the theme in the first track, as well as the theme for the Ludlow family, are truly masterpieces in their own right; when I heard them in the movie, I shed tears because these compositions fit perfectly with the drama and the beautiful landscapes you see on screen.  In spite of the similarity of the track 'Revenge' with Horner's 'Hightland's Execution' from \\"Patriot Games\\", the beauty and the power of the aforementioned themes is overwhelming enough to forget that track.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Legends Of The Fall\\" is a far better work than \\"Titanic\\", to tell you the truth, and this is one great, great film score by James Horner.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|I am a Meat Loaf fan, more importantly a Jim Steinman fan, and a Brian May fan.  This CD did not dissapoint!  Although many of the tracks follow a Steinman formula, it is that formula that has made his previous work--\\"work.\\"  Some of the short tracks are forgettable, but \\"Seize the Night\\" makes it all forvigable. Steinman is in true form and the orchestration is powerful and moving.  Needless to say, Meat Loaf's hard-rock vocals are solid, as usual.  A nice addition to the trilogy.
B000IU3XTM|2.0|I think maybe I'm not hip enough to like this CD.  I really want to like it.  I've listened to it several times.  I'm trying really hard to figure out what he's trying to say.  Maybe I'm not deep enough.  So many people are saying this is such a great CD and so much like his first one.  Huh?  I understood the first one.  This one, not so much.  I read the reviews trying to find out what I'm missing and still I don't get it.  Maybe I should find the lyrics and then I'll understand what he's saying.  I'm hoping it will grow on me and maybe '9 Crimes' is starting to, but the others not so much.  Overall, a big disapointment.
B000GFLAI0|3.0|Anyone who says that his album ranks amongst Dylan's finest records is an outright liar, and I would question the fact that they have even heard Dylan's finest work.  I own every record Bob Dylan released between 1961 and 1968 as well as \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and \\"Desire\\" (in other words, his best work), so when Bob's new album got such glowing reviews from even the most respectable publications (I'm looking at you Pitchfork) and a #1 Billboard debut I was interested, excited even.  Oh forlorn! This album is as disappointing as anything I've heard this year. <br /> <br />     The opener is probably the best song on the album, and that's not saying much.  I figured \\"Modern Times\\" would contain a bit of downtempo, old-man-blues, but I never would have expected Bob's lyrics to so thoroughly disappoint me.  Honestly I wasn't expecting another \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" or \\"Tangled up in Blue\\" or even \\"Hurricane\\" but I expect more from the man who gave me \\"It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding\\" than generic biblical allusion and vague, uninspired political commentary. <br /> <br />     Having not heard \\"Time Out of Mind\\" or \\"Love and Theft\\" I was surprised by Dylan's age and tobacco ravaged voice (he is now incapable of the nasal, over-pronounced style he became famous for) and the complete lack of engaging melodies on this album.  I don't mind a slow tempo as long as the chord progression or vocal melody can catch my ear, but sadly \\"Modern Times\\" contains little of either. <br /> <br />     If you aren't familiar with Bob Dylan's work and you're interested, I reccommend giving a listen to \\"Bringin' It All Back Home\\", \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", or if you're into quiet (political) folk music, \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\".  Also I should point out that that his album isn't terrible, just uninspired and that's the real tragedy for me.  Dylan's best work has always been able to trigger strong emotions for me, and this album only makes me feel let-down and, at times, just plain bored.
0385751060|5.0|What an incredible story! John Boyne has created innocent, naïve Bruno and given him a powerful story to tell. This moving book should be required reading for everyone.<br /><br />Set in the 1940's in Berlin, Germany, the story centers around a nine-year-old German boy named Bruno. His family leaves Berlin to move to the country because his father has been reassigned by the \\"Fury.\\"  Bruno's youth and innocence has protected him from the harsh realities of Hilter and his reign of terror.<br /><br />Life in the country is dull and boring for Bruno. He doesn't understand his new home, \\"Out-With.\\"  He's left his friends behind and doesn't like the smaller house he's forced to live in with his parents and his sister. Missing the hustle and bustle of the city, Bruno begins to explore his new surroundings. Beyond the fence near his house, he sees people, but is confused by their strange striped pajamas and their sad demeanor.<br /><br />Bruno's loneliness is somewhat relieved when he becomes friends with a boy on the other side of the fence. They meet daily and exchange comments about their daily lives, but neither fully understands the circumstances of the other.<br /><br />Boyne presents a story about the Holocaust like none other before. He brings tragedy to life through the eyes of innocent children. Readers of all ages will be spellbound until the last page and beyond.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Sally Kruger, aka \\"Readingjunky\\"
0307341542|4.0|I nearly gave up after trying to work my way through the Gordian Knot of metaphors and similies in Chapter I - however - this was a very cleaverly written book and kept me untii the end.  Frankly, I would love to see another adverture with the hero. I know there is a danger repeating a success, but Ms. Flynn has a sharpe sense for character development fitting the hero between the anti and the flawed. I understand why Stephen King liked this book - I enjoyed his book about newspaper reporters/writers of a small town newspaper.  It was particularly colorful in the audio book format.

This guy just may be who we need in the White House.\\" <br /> <br />Unfortunately after reading this book, I came to the conclusion that he is still too much the apologist and politician, not enough of an American. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong...I still have great respect and share many of Mr. Obama's views about our country, but I was expecting a scathing indictment of both the Democrat and Republican parties, and he seems too willing to let the Demos questionable acts just slide by. <br /> <br />He states he spoke to Zel Miller, a man who wrote about the many shortcomings of his party, but did he really hear what Miller had to say? <br /> <br />He talks about going throught the hallowed halls of the White House, thinking of the remarkable history which happened there, but has he heard the people who give tours there talk about how almost all the visitors to the White House constantly ask about wanting to see \\"where Bill and Monica did it?\\" <br /> <br />He tell us the Swift Boat Vets are besmirching the honor of a decorated Vietnam Vet (John Kerry), but has he really heard what they have to say?  <br /> <br />Maybe later he'll be the man we need to run our country...but not right now.
B000002I2M|5.0|LA Woman, the last gasp of a group that was running out of ideas, such that their long erstwhile producer Paul Rothschild threw the towel in and refused to produce it having declared to the group they were merely playing \\"cocktail lounge music\\"?  <br /> <br />Well on the evidence of the remastered CD that was not at all what the final product turned out like. Morrison may have been on his last legs physically as proven by his subsequent early death and emotionally low given the Miami obscenity trial bearing down on him, but the Lizard King went out with all cylinders firing. The recordings were made in a nearby basement the group  having vacated the Elektra studios by mutual consent, but being the professionals they were the recordings retain all that was great about the Doors - well played instrumentation by three great musicians with the right hard or light touch as the recordings required and Morrison contributing some great songs notably the title track and Riders on the Storm, though overall there are no fillers.  <br /> <br />The album was certainly more bluesy that any prior offerings (even including John Lee Hooker's \\"Crawling King Snake\\") but as a band that had always been open to many varied influences that adaptation did not cause any energy level loss. What hits one most on relistening now several decades later  is that while a lot of the songs were longer workouts than the prior rocking \\"Morrison Hotel\\" LP they still have a quality that leaves standing the earlier recordings by the group - \\"LA Woman\\" versus \\"The End\\"? - no contest with the later Doors winning hands down in my book!
B00005JKC3|3.0|Being a big fan of the comic I was really disappointed by this big screen version. Sure it tells the story well of how Bruce Banner became the Hulk but lacked any sense of action or adventure. Way too long, it seemed to take forever for the transformation to take place and was very slow and boring in some parts. Maybe I expected too much from the film, but it is still an okay movie. I was a lttle surprised by the casting of Eric Bana as the Hulk, as much as a fan of his that I am of his having followed his career from 'full frontal' and 'the castle, I don't think he was the best option. A good reason to purchase this movie is for the special features.
B000002I2I|5.0|The general perceived wisdom is that the Doors made two outstanding records at the outset and then it was a story of continual decline except for the odd highlight track until Jim Morrison's death in a bath in Paris. Well, listening at the remastered set of Doors CDs, leaves one feeling that 40 odd years on that initial assessment may be up for challenge. <br /> <br />The reason being that listening now to \\"Morrison Hotel\\" one is not left feeling that this was a group in exit mode. Instead it was one that could still lay down a full set of energetic and memorable songs all well sung and played and well recorded and produced by the duo of Paul Rothschild and Bruce Botnick. The three musicians show yet again why LA always had a harder edge than SF in the late 1960s when it came to playing rock and blues. While a number of songs may recycle prior ideas not least due to Morrison's continual plagiarising of book titles to inpsire his song writing, they are none the worse for that. <br /> <br />When it came out this record got panned based largely on critic's memories of those first two recordings and claims of it being just more of the same. However the lack of over inflated workouts (\\"The End\\" and \\"When the music's over\\") and a better focus on shorter and sharper songs plus a greater energy and sense of rock and roll (\\"Roadhouse Blues\\" & \\"You make me real\\") make for my ears a much better overall set. Special highlight is Robbie Krieger's guitar playing throughout of short and memorable solos and licks - a continual joy and sadly heard too little of post the Doors demise. It is no surprise that such energy was also on show in the subsequent Live double LP set. <br /> <br />With the final recording \\"LA Woman\\" yet to come, \\"Morrison Hotel\\" has no sense of decline or despair about it - it is just great music that as a whole is a much more enjoyable listen in 2006 than the now rather thinner sounding first two LPs.
B000000OUE|4.0|This album is great from beginning to end. A classic heavy-metal album, from Electric Head to Blood, Milk and Sky, this is a ride that will fire you up and stir the demons from within. One of my most listened to CD's, still a favourite, even today.
B000FFJ85I|2.0|I got into AFI with the release of Art of Drowning, which is a fantastic album.  My girlfriend at the time had Black Sails in the Sunset and even though I didn't really get into it then, I now think it rivals AOD.  AFI has always been a band to look towards the future and embrace a sense of progress (this is highly commendable).  These two albums, which formed my introduction to AFI, now stand as the mid-part of their career.  <br /> <br />The band has always refused to simply fall into the groove of what's cool.  They've always been unique.  Their first two albums came out of their intense interest in the 80's and early 90's hardcore punk scene.  Davey Havoc may have summarized the roots of the albums best when he says, \\"Ever since I can remember I wanted to be in a hardcore band,\\" at the beginning of the \\"He Who Laughs Last\\" video.  These albums are full of the intensity of the early hardcore scene.  When the band emerged into this middle era the music was totally fresh and delightfully dark (it was there in the early days, though, in songs like Brownie Bottom Sundae).  These middle albums (haloween ep and self-titled included) also had an intensity and an energy that blew away their old sound.  Moreover, I've yet to hear a band in the world of punk (past and present) who's music rivals this intensity. <br /> <br />I appreciate the two newer albums on an artistic level; they continue to break the mold (the goth glam influence is pretty cool).  Besides, who can say they didn't see them foreshadowed in certain moments on Black Sails and AOD.  But, personally, it's pretty difficult to listen to Decemberunderground.  AFI deserves all the respect in the world but I don't feel much of the fire of the old days.
B00005JLEU|5.0|To put it simply, this movie is brilliant. If you take any part of this movie and separate it from the rest of the parts it would still be pretty good. The drawing and animation is wonderful here, the soundtrack is incredible (includes my favorite song ever), and the plot is exciting and even scary.<br /><br />The first thing I'd like to say is that if you know how to read, please throw away the dubbed listening choice. The voices are much worse and don't fit the characters as well. In the original Japanese everything flows much nicer, and the characters feel more real. Read the subtitles, because this is a Japanese movie, and not an American movie. In English it feels like Disney, which it is very clearly not.<br /><br />Many people, however, do compare Miyazaki to Disney. The two are very different. Some say that Spirited Away is scary. It's not more scary than my personal scariest movie, the Little Mermaid. But in reality, you can't compare the two. The drawing styles are so different, and where Disney is most often awkward, Miyazaki flows and is very pretty.<br /><br />The movie itself has a nice plot that's quite easy to follow. One thing leads to another, after all. Chihiro is trapped in this other world and wants her parents back. Now we ask the question, how? And this is precisely the movie.<br /><br />There are no boring parts. I mean it. Nothing. The one scene that someone might consider dull is one of the best, because it is just so beautiful. The plot glides smoothly, going from one thing to another. It is funny, exciting, sad, scary, and cute all at once.<br /><br />So I'm recommending. I mean, REALLY recommending. It's a wonderful movie that the first time I saw I fell in love with. It's not the kind of movie where with each viewing you discover something new, but it's brilliant nonetheless. It's an incredible film with incredible animation and an incredible plot. I can't recommend it more. Buy it, watch it... It's wonderful. Anybody who claims that this movie isn't a \\"masterpiece\\" may be right. It may not be, though I believe it is. But that doesn't mean it isn't amazing. Everyone can agree on that. Just use subtitles and don't watch it dubbed.<br /><br />Watch and enjoy.right. It may not be, though I believe it is. But that doesn't mean it isn't amazing. Everyone can agree on that.

0684135051|5.0|This is my first EZ purchase.  I was so impressed with the book and with what seemed so obvious in Zimmermann's \\"recipe's,\\" I purchased a 2nd as a gift for my sister.  We are both pleased with the freedom this book has given us! <br /> <br />Zimmermann's whimsical whit is also a joy! She reminds me of the  aunt who secretly spoils you with freshly baked cookies when your parents aren't around. *sigh*  Those were the days.  Anyway, I digress... <br /> <br />I have to admit, the first thing I did when I received my copy was skim through it looking for photos.  I learn better with them.  I was a tad disappointed with the few photos and their less than perfect quality.  But when I started reading, I had forgotten this detail.  This book is definitely worth every penny!  I'm sure this is just the first of many EZ books I'll be adding to my library.
B000J103X4|1.0|Right off the bat how do you name your album after someone who is not apart of it. But then again he couldn't name it anything else cause Dr. Dre is all he talks about and he pretty much just uses Dre's flow. I had to go back and listen the The Documentry to remember what what Game really sounds like. This man's rhyme book pretty much consist of Dr. Dre, West Coast, G Unit and 64 Impalas. He does so much name droppin it sounds like his reading out of a phonebook. this album is mediocre, it comes no where near the The Documentry. Big dissappoinment, not worth half the hype.
0143036556|5.0|Someone gave me Guns, Germs, and Steel last Christmas, and I enjoyed it so much I had to buy the sequel, if you will, Collapse. Normally, the sequel is not greater than the original, but in this case it was. Both books are among my very favorites. Buy and read this book. All world history courses should throw away their textbooks and replace them with Guns, Germs, and Steel and Collapse. These two books provide a big picture on how societies and civilizations rose and fell.
B000HT386M|4.0|I actually took the kids to see this movie and it was entertaining for the whole family.  It had everything for all ages.  Family friendly with a lesson for everyone.  Being a weekend parent I have to utilise the time with my grommits.  Because in a few years they will be turning into their terrible teens. Thats the years they start thinking they know everything. And hanging out with their old man won't be cool anymore.  Adam's movies are so family friendly that my kids always enjoy the night outs.
B000GPIPD8|5.0|I heard a DJ say that rock is dead -- that all the riffs have been invented and all the themes have been explored.  This disc is living proof that the DJ was wrong!  THE RAW POWER OF THE SOUL SHOWCASED IN THIS ALBUM IS STAGGERING! RUN TO BUY THIS AND GROOVE TO IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

B000IOM1RI|4.0|The first Tenacious D album just gets better every time you listen to it. This album is the same way. However, it is definitely too short. Come on JB, the greatest band in the world should release a 10 hour cd. That way we could rock out non-stop!!
B00068IOWC|4.0|Overall this is a good album. A couple of tracks do very little for me, but there are some that shine!! Reading the Bono Interviews book also helped me to understand some of this album a bit more, especially those songs dealing with his father's death. Favorite songs: Vertigo, Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own (I still cry every time I hear it), Original of the Species, and Yahweh.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Whether or not The Open Door plays as a Fallen pt. 2 or not, I'm overjoyed to have Amy back making music. Her voice has always been a favorite of mine and the dark overtones of the music really helped her delivery. The departure of Ben both startled me and left me wondering but I knew Evanescence would be able to move on without him. His presence is missed in a few of the heavier tracks but for the most part, Amy and company put out a great follow up.<br /><br />I, much like just about every other fan, picked up on Evanescence with their breakout single, Bring Me To Life. Fast forward through some inner-band drama and a very long 3 year wait, we now have The Open Door. I won't deny that parts sound very familiar but it's easy to see that Evanescence, and more importantly Amy, has grown a lot from Fallen. The lyrics range from inspirational to scathing and the music covers every emotion possible. The Open Door does beg repeated listens, both to begin to like and then because you can't get the friggin' song out of your head.<br /><br />If you came in loving Evanescence then I see no reason why your love for them won't continue. This IS Evanescence, and it's an angry, focused version of Evanescence as well. Amy Lee sounds as good as ever in songs like Lithium, Snow White Queen, Like You, and All That I'm Living For and the band sounds equally focused in songs like Sweet Sacrifice, Weight Of The World, Lacrymosa, Lose Control, and Your Star. If you were a fan of the original piano-based version of My Immortal then have no fear! Amy fails to disappoint on the piano laden tracks. Other than that, heck it's Evanescence doing what they do, that's it.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Sweet Sacrifice, Snow White Queen, Lacrymosa, Like You, and All That I'm Living For. Basically if you go in with an open mind then you won't be disappointed. The entire band has matured and so has their music. There's change just not a lot and that's probably where my, and every other complaining fan's, beef is. If you listen to Origin and then listen to Fallen, Amy really seems more sure of herself and so did Moody. Listen to Fallen and then listen to The Open Door now. Sure they come out with guns blazing in Sweet Sacrifice but there's not a ton of difference. I love this CD and listen to it all the time still but I do hope that they really experiment with their sound on their next outing (hopefully that won't take another 3 years).laining fan's, beef is.

B000AMJDHY|2.0|There's a certain bourgeois charm these teenagers adhere to, as if they know the world is their oyster if they play coy enough - but they really don't care.  Skip the absurd song titles [come on, `Lying Is The Most Fun A Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off'?  `There's A Good Reason These Tables are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought Of It Yet'?] and you'll find a silly concoction of wannabe PopPunk poetry smothered in Emo-excess from high school graduates who rented `A Clockwork Orange' one too many times. Perhaps, this caught me on a good day, but it's not as insulting as it could have been and a lot more fun than the new one from that other Las Vegas `Vegas' act, The Killers.  My grade:  B-
B000I5X80G|5.0|Finally, a recording that does justice to the awesome rhythm section of Molina and Talbot and Whitten's uncanny sense for fills, frills and punctuation.  Much better,in many ways, than anything captured in the studio by this band, it is absolutely clear,like never before, why Neil loved to play with these guys--especially when he felt like cutting loose some of his unique psychotic guitar----It took a band as heavy as Crazy Horse to keep Neil's feet on the ground---or,at least, provide him with a place to land.  Splendid indeed!!!!!
0312323867|4.0|Emily Giffin paints with a rather broad brush. What would you say? ..... it's well-crafted but not exactly subtle. Her first-person character, Darcy Rhone, is pretty, petty, conniving, shallow, egotistical and to top it off, a gold-digger. Giffin makes sure we readers REALLY get that. Maybe she's hoping even the dimmest bimbo can't miss the message.<br /><br />Anyway, Darcy's materialistic choices propel her into the dog house until she has to trick her only remaining friend - Ethan, a writer who has a tiny flat in London - into letting her \\"visit\\". She has no intention of keeping her promise of a few weeks' stay, as she needs to sponge off someone while getting through her ill-advised pregnancy.<br /><br />The story line is a mixture of simpleton wackiness, sexuality and an extremely obvious sudden change in Darcy's attitude and behavior following a verbal reality check delivered by Ethan. Everything ends up \\"happily ever after\\" in an almost Pollyanna-ish finish.<br /><br />\\"Something Blue\\" is a good, amusing read with much skillful writing and a moral to the story; still not exactly rocket science, folks.
B000I5X81A|1.0|I only hope this doesn't signify the end of his career. Any time an artist begins consistently collaborating with \\"friends\\", it signals the end of a career. Look at Santana. The guy can't make a solo album anymore. This is what happened to John Lee Hooker. Musically, this albums lacks the care Clapton used to give his music. He used to be a careful, calculated musician who knew how to rock. Just bear this in mind if you buy the album. You may want to enjoy this CD with a 6-pack of ensure while wearing your favorite pair of Depends. And a members only jacket. Clapton just doesn't know what he wants on this album. Blues? Jazz? Easy Listening? Ho-Down Appalachian Stomp? Hee Haw? Crooner?<br /><br />Eric, make up your mind. Then give us a cd worth a listen.
B00005JPC4|4.0|A GOOD YEAR indeed is a reminescent and sentimental film.  The main theme falls within the lines of looking back and looking forward, and has viewers watching how fast-paced stock broker executive, Max Skinner, (Russell Crowe)changes to a guy who actually has a heart.  However, it takes the death of his Uncle Henry (Albert Finney)the discovery of an American cousin, Christie Roberts (Abbie Cornish), and a sudden eye for a childhood memory, Fanny Chenal (Marion Cotillard), to change his ways.<br /><br />A GOOD YEAR is a nostalgic film.  The soundtrack is filled with an array of nostalgic 1970s flavor tunes by Harry Nilsson, which accompanies Max's childhood flashbacks, such playing chess with Uncle Henry while sharing a glass of wine, dives into the garden pool, and playing cricket inside the Chateau.  Ridley Scott does a fine job depicting Max's youth and the close relationship with his uncle.  A nice treat to the film, if one watches closely, is the scene where Fanny and Max go on an evening excursion.  They watch a collage of classic French Cinema flash on the movie screen, which shows the legendary work of renowned French actors of French comedy and film, such as Jacques Tati and a host of others.<br /><br />A GOOD YEAR has a combination of comedy and light drama.  If you enjoy films, such as SIDEWAYS, BIG FISH, or UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN, this may be an interesting movie to see.  After all the food and wine references, one may want to have something to eat or drink, but stay away from the Chateau Le Siroque.
B000002IGP|4.0|More trebly than the Crue (and with way less make-up), the mischevous rockers from Ratt put out this classic album back in 1984. More than anything, its a paean to fast and direct rock and roll. There's no pussyfootin' here; lyrics don't deal with anything transcendant (\\"She Wants Money\\" is about a girl who wants money... who would've thought?) and the riffs keep on coming. Yes, on one level, there's nothing redeeming about this sort of approach. On another level, one can appreciate the absolutely rockin' guitar stylings embodied by the band. From the fast \\"I'm Insane\\" to the pop rock classic \\"Round & Round\\" this album packs a nice rockin' wallop. Any fan of 80s rock must have a copy of this in their collection,

B00025ETIW|1.0|I had heard a lot about My Chemical Romance, both positive and negative. I decided to pick up a used copy of 'Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge' so I could form my own opinion without the biased input of from jaded indie hipster snobs who automatically hate anything in the mainstream or 14 year-old spoiled scene kids with questionable taste.    This record was apparently written and marketed to deliver pop songs, and the opener 'Helena' is an outstanding one. It has a great melody that stands up to repeated listening, and the performance is passionate and convincing. The problem is that on almost every other song on the album [with a few notable exceptions], I was bored with the melodies and performances, even after extensive repeated listening [I'm talking about keeping this in my CD player for over 2 months, not just a quick skip-through]. The high-gloss production values suffocate the rocking power and sonic depth that the music otherwise would have had, and the melodrama of the lyrics and melodies gets old real fast when they don't deliver the pop hooks they promise.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|Charlie Price [Joel Edgerton] has spent his whole life in \\"shoes\\" and hated it. He at last finds an excuse to leave Northampton and go to London with his girlfriend. No sooner has he arrived in London when his father dies and leaves the factory to Charlie. The factory [unbeknown to Charlie] has been failing and his father had considered selling up. Business is so bad that  Charlie has to let people go. One employee encouraged Charlie to find a new \\"niche market\\" and quite by accident encounters Lola [Chiwetel Ejiofor], a drag queen in London, when he tries to prevent her from being beaten up. In the fracas Lola's boots fall apart, and ever the businessman, Charlie promises to make Lola some new boots - and Lola tells him exactly what she wants. <br />     This is the start of something new - Kinky Boots which will turn the factory around. <br />     This wonderful film is full of humour, sadness and umpteen other emotions. Chiwetel Ejiofor has a fabulous voice and the role of Lola could almost have been created for him. The scenes from Lola's nightclub are wonderful - the music superb. Some very funny lines \\"are you a man or a lady? I just want to know whether to leave the toilet seat up or down\\" comes from a little old lady who Lola rents a room from.
0307341542|1.0|The characters are all over the top dysfunctional.  The main character is boring and self destructive.  When the characters are not likeable who cares what has or will happen to them??  This book reads like a 1970's Movie of the Week starring Lindsay Wagner.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|As I implied in my review of Muse's album &#34;Absolution&#34;, every Muse album is worth listening.  This one is, again, loud and melodic, tender and heartbreaking. Matthew Bellamy writes songs that will be listened to many decades in the future.  Enjoy!
B000H30B3G|3.0|The 3-disc \\"Collector's Edition\\" is clearly the best version of the 2005 King Kong on DVD. The extras are pretty much complete and you also get a \\"director's cut\\" of the movie. Unlike the long versions of the LOtR's films, this is a true \\"director's cut\\" - if possible, Jackson would have made this movie six hours long!  <br /> <br />Epic remake of 1933 classic is marred by Jackson & Co's typically inept writing, with centerless characters manipulated through contrived plot convolutions until the writers pull the plug on them. The film is now 90 minutes overlong, instead of a mere 60. Being a kid at heart, I welcome the extra dino-action, but expanded 'character' material adds nothing to the film, since the writers obviously never figured out who the characters really are or why they do any of the things they are made to do in the film.  <br /> <br />Visual effects are uneven but above average throughout. Kong himself benefits from the extreme compression of a television screen, looking far more convincing than he did on the big screen. The film is also packed to the gills with references to the original Kong and the 1976 remake (which I recommend). Jackson placed props from the original movie in his own sets and restaged some of its most iconic gags; and the gunner who kills Kong is none other than Rick Baker, famed makeup artist who portrayed Kong in 1976!  <br /> <br />Overall, for Peter Jackson fans or King Kong collectors, this is worth the price tag. For everyone else: stick to the 1933 original, which kids and adults still love!
0783240236|4.0|\\"The Birds\\" (1963) is a film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and that fact alone should be enough to make you want to read the rest of this review :)<br /><br />The plot is simple, but effective. Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), a beautiful woman with a lot of time on her hands, decides to follow Mitch (Rod Taylor), a man she just met,  when he visits his hometown for the weekend. Melanie doesn't know Mitch very well, but she believes that they could begin a relationship, as they are quite attracted to each other. However, once Melanie arrives to Mitch's small town, something strange happens: a gull attacks her without any kind of provocation. That kind of behaviour is extremely unusual in gulls, according to local people. But will that be the last weird thing to happen? Well, just wait and see.<br /><br />From my point of view, \\"The birds\\" is one of Hitchcock's best films, even though my personal favorite is \\"Vertigo\\". I would like to highlight the fact that this film manages to mix suspense, action and terror, throwing in a developing love story and some characters that you cannot help but care about. In a nutshell, the kind of movie you should watch, unless you are already really (really) afraid of birds. Recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcat

B000I5X80G|5.0|If you can't run with this CD, you just don't like Neil Young and Crazy Horse. Long drawn out sets of gritty garage band grunge rock. My only problem with this CD is that there are only six songs. Not going to say it's better then Weld but that's just because of the song count. I love this CD and generally speaking I don't like live CD's. Prefer studio.<br /><br />Buy it if you are a Neil Young and Crazy Horse fan. Period.

0812975219|4.0|Random events are unpredictable.  Reading the review below by Craig West just highlights it. Not as a personal attack on him but it is precisely that kind of thinking among traders and analysts (he happens to be a mid-level analyst one at UBS) that is why most of them have short term careers and most of them generate no real sustainable alpha. As for this book, it is worth your time if you want to really understand risk management which obviously Craig West is not privyed to or maybe UBS would let him manage some money.

0440824400|5.0|This book deeply wrote exactly how I feel about society, harsh judgement people pass to each other, and how everyone seems to be afraid of what's different. Individuality is beautiful. Choices are amazing. Life would be nothing without pain. Without pain you couldn't experience happiness so deeply. Life would be nothing without freedom. Even though I question the \\"freedom\\" we have anyways. This was a very moving book. And it made me laugh too. Humor is always good. The one thing that connects people.

It is truly amazing that he is alive, he probably should have died at least a dozen times.  I am a RHCP fan but you don't have to be one to read this book, you are dragged into the storyline and left wanting more.  I think the book should be made into a movie.  Great read!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|\\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is a film by Jared Hess and stars Jon Heder. It's an independent film, more or less, featuring quirky characters, but unlike so many other independent films in this vein, it's not depressing or malicious. It's a lighthearted comedy with heart and personality, and a very quotable one at that. I don't remember it coming out in theatres here in Australia (I first heard about it here on amazon), but it has gone on to be a big hit on DVD. I've even seen a \\"Vote For Pedro\\" t-shirt or two being worn up in the city. <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite lives in an American country town. He loves to draw mythical beasts, dreams of numchucks and bo skills, plays tetherball, feeds his aunt's llama every day and doesn't have many friends. After going to a self defense course with his brother Kip, he is told that he has to have someone to watch his back. Fortunately, there's a new kid at school, a Mexican immigrant called Pedro. There's also Deb, a girl who left a whole box of merchandise she was selling on his doorstep for college money. The school dance is coming up, so is the school election, and Napoleon's uncle Rico is in town, a man who is stuck in 1982, in his glory days as a footballer. Also on the calendar is a meeting between Kip and La Fawnduh, his internet girlfriend. Do Napoleon, his family and friends have the skills to get through the year? <br /> <br />The film has a tacky, domestic kind of setting, and in that way it reminds me a bit of the Australian TV series \\"Kath and Kim\\", though that show doesn't feel quite as detatched and awkward as this film does. It's a good detatched and awkward though, it goes with and adds to the characters I think. They're all a bit out of the ordinary, but there's a kind of sense to what they're doing. Some of the fun I had watching this was trying to figure out what the characters were thinking and how they really felt about each other (Napoleon and Deb's friendship, for instance). Being set in Jared Hess' home townhelped a bit, I think. He would have known where to go, what backdrops he wanted against the plot.  <br /> <br />I could relate to a few of the characters in this film. I don't know anyone exactly like Napoleon, but I know a few people who have a few \\"Napoleon\\" elements. I know back in high school I used to draw pictures of weird creatures, and of girls in my class (though I never sent pictures to the girls like Napoleon did). I knew people who were way into the self-defense stuff, and one or two people who have Napoleon's way of replying. Maybe there's a bit of Napoleon (or Kip or Deb or Pedro) in a lot of people. <br /> <br />Special features on the regular edition include a making of the after-credits scene, and an audio commentary with Jared Hess and Jon Heder, recalling anecdotes and influences for the film. A lot of it is actually from Jared's life, it seems. <br /> <br />Definitely worth a look if you're interested.
B000000XCF|4.0|Yes, this IS the album with Fortunate Son, CCR's signature tune, on it. Yes, it's also got Down on the Corner, which charted a good eleven places ahead of Fortunate Son (I'm a dork for knowing that. So what?) even though the former is far better-known. These are the best songs off Willy & the Poor Boys. But most (not all, mind you) of the rest unfairly rests in the shadow of those two tracks. They actually manage to breathe new life into the oft-covered Midnight Special (which has transcended the level of \\"standard\\" at this point), thanks to them very much making it their own. It Came Out of the Sky is pretty damn funny; Don't Look Now, a great love song; Side o' the Road, one of their best instrumentals; and Effigy, easily their best extended song. How'd all of these songs disappear? Okay, their cover of Leadbelly's Cotton Fields is far from essential; Poor Boy Shuffle's a bad instrumental; Feelin' Blue, an overlong jam. But this is a solid record overall!
0553573403|2.0|If you like reading fictional historical medieval novels, this book and fantastic and you will love it.  Buy it and read it. But, if you like FANTASY novels, you'd better stay away.  Why?<br /><br />1)There are only two actual fight scenes in the entire 864 page novel.  No, I'm not kidding. Of course, one of the two is in the first chapter of the book, in order to get you to read further (hell, it worked on me, unfortunately).<br /><br />2)There are no monsters or races other than humans in the entire book, other than a brief scene in the first chapter and a brief scene in the last chapter.  Again, I'm being literal here. NO MONSTERS.  NO OTHER HUMANOID RACES.<br /><br />3) As has been stated in other reviews here, there is NO MAGIC.  Yes, they talk about magic (even then, in only one or two scenes) , but you never see any.<br /><br />Again, I'm not recommending against this book.  The writing, plot, and characters are excellent.  It's a great HISTORICAL FICTION novel, but it is NOT FANTASY.  If you buy this book expecting fantasy, you're going to be really, really ticked off.  I was.
0380789019|4.0|This was a very enjoyable read. While it had familiar elements...and was in some ways reminicent of Clive Barkers 'Weave World' (mostly the hero...but also the tone...anyone else notice that?)...I had enough fun reading it to make Neil Gaiman an author I'll read more of.
0446528056|4.0|I would say this is one of my favorite Nicholas Sparks novels. It is a thought provoking and more true to life story than most. If you want a happily ever after story than you might want to read something else, but I say you're missing out. Granted the book didn't have an ending like we might expect or hope, but it couldn't really have ended any other way or I would have been disappointed with the person that John became in this story. Besides,there COULD be a sequel....
0743289412|2.0|As an American child growing up in France I had many testing experiences, but none as grisly as those that befell the future novelist Scott Landon, whose father was certifiably insane and tortured him and his older brother Paul with a sharp cutting knife.  As Stephen King tells it, early trauma caused Scott to retreat to an imaginary kingdom called \\"Boo'ya Moon\\" and then, upon emerging, to begin a career as an avant-garde novelist and Pultizer Prize winner.  Along the way he met and married a waitress with five or six sisters, Lisey Debusher, and they lived together for seventeen years until his tragic death two years before the action of the story begins, as the widow, Lisey, tries to get on with her life, dealing with the problem of Scott's archive, and if she finally feels up to disposing of it at a university library.  The remainder of the book is told from Lisey's POV, and this will be what divides King's public, her stream of consciousness-esque perceptions of every little thing of the past and present, both in Maine and in Boo'ya Moon, and the way she feels the presence of her dead husband ever near.  Most of the firestorm will be because of Lisey's pet catchphrases.  It isn't enough that she comes herself from a family ripe (overripe) with pet phrases, all of them revolting, but she married into another, and then she and Scott developed their own secret lover's code, and the reader can hardly keep it all straight.  You read on for a page or two, thinking, this can't possibly get any more precious and affected, and then, bang, you have no smucking idea.<br /><br />The book improves as it goes along, although a subplot concerning Lisey's ribald older sister, Amanda, and her penchant for cutting herself, is nothing but improbable Lifetime Television for Women nonsense.  A second subplot, that focuses on a conspiracy between a scholar and a sociopath to wrest control of Scott's papers from his widow, is even more unlikely, and King's latest supervillain, the nutty Jim Dooley, is very much like the John Turturro character in the SECRET GARDEN movie.  Why does King even bother to give him a new name, it's the same character--King's fantasy of his crazed reader, I suppose.  The sexual torture of women is very much Dooley's thing and something terrible happens halfway through this book that repels me even to think about.  After forty books I am now thinking, Stephen King, your mind is a swamp and this writing excites you.<br /><br />Okay, now this is one of those things that, for me was a dealbreaker.  Say you were the widow of one of the nation's top novelists, a working class woman who had come into a great deal of wealth.  Say you're now worth 20 million dollars, as Lisey is.  And say you had received telephone calls from a sexual psychopath saying he was coming to molest you.  And say he had put a dead cat in your mailbox.  Wouldn't you seek protection?  Couldn't you afford, say, a bodyguard?  Or would you do as Lisey does and just call the sheriff and nod off when he tells you that sorry, he can't help you?  Of course it's insane.  Anybody would have called a private security firm and in fact, gotten the hell out of Dodge and holed up in Ibiza until your 20 million dollars had tracked the sociopath down and had him disposed of  by hook or by crook.  No commentators have mentioned this point, so perhaps it hasn't occurred to anyone else . . .  but it led me to think, why indeed is Lisey so wealthy--I mean, why is it necessary to the story?  Wouldn't the story have worked just as well if she was an average everyday person struggling to make ends meet?  Has King forgotten that there are people who aren't zillionaires?  (In fact, why is Scott even a writer?  How was that necessary to the story?  Couldn't he just have been an accountant or something?  How many of King's heroes have been tortured novelists, it's tedious to even try listing them.)  Every now and then, King's publishers make a big deal out of his literary skills,and he drags in his \\"quality\\" writing friends to provide promising blurbs.  Amy Tan went to town to sell us BAG OF BONES.  The end of the DARK TOWER series was heralded as a major moment in contemporary writing.  Now Michael Chabon tells us that LISEY'S STORY represents some sort of gravitational shift in ecriture.  The truth is that all these books have been really terrible.  Is it just Chabon's star fever that prevents him from seeing this?  I won't be fooled again.lls, and he drags in his \\"quality\\" writing friends to provide promising blurbs.

B00005KB9R|5.0|In my mind, Bob Marley has great songs, but generally inconsistant albums. This is the exception to the rule. Bob's angry at the state of the human race here, and he wants you to know. And people tend to make good music while angry. This is no exception. Pretty much every song is classic: Get Up, Stand Up (which got even better virtually ever time he played it live); I Shot the Sheriff; and Burnin' are the best-known, and best. Also check out the politically-charged, pro-revolutionary Small Axe; Duppy Conqueror, with great harominies; Pass It On; and the call for unity One Foundation. I'd call Hallelujah Time the weakest of the bunch. But as for the rest? It's all good. BUY IT! (For the record, Natty Dread and Rastaman Vibration are pretty good too, Live! and Legend, greatest hits comp or not, are indespensible).
B00004RFFI|5.0|I don't know how they did it, but they got a cow to fly. They must have put a harness around Helen Hunt's midsection. Truly, truly, truly a movie that should never have been made. The story is absurd, ridiculous and has no basis in reality. Kind of like Helen Hunt's rise to fame in Hollywood.
1563894696|5.0|Jeph Loeb as writer and Tim Sale as artist make an amazing team.  No one can write about the Gotham mob like Loeb, and no one can draw Catwoman like Sale.  The Long Halloween spans one year, from Oct. 31st during one of Batman's earlier years fighting crime (although come to think of it he looks older and gritty) to the following Halloween.  A killer dubbed \\"Holiday\\" by the media is picking off high-ranking members of the Falcone crime family.  Batman and Police Commissioner James Gordon (shown here with brown hair, first wife, and baby Barbara) are completely baffled by the killer's ability to get so close to the targets.  Could it be someone within the Falcone empire itself?  Or could it be Catwoman?  Or Harvey Dent, whose wife Gilda was the victim (she survived) of an attack on their home because of Dent's efforts to prosecute the mob?  Harvey has been hanging by a thread, lately.<br /><br />Gotham's supervillians are not pleased by Holiday's appearance, either. Some are frustrated at having attention taken away from them.  Others are hired by Falcone for reasons unknown.  Some villians featured are the Riddler, Joker, Mad Hatter, Poison Ivy, and Solomon Grundy.<br /><br />The art is fantastic.  Gotham was never drawn and colored better.  Highly, highly, highly recommended as one of the best Batman graphic novels I have ever read.
B000HDR9NG|5.0|Many people are dissapointed by the new sound of this album, the new sound in tracks such as Sam's Town, Bling, For Reasons Unknown, Uncle Johny, and Read My Mind. I too was at first turned off by this new sound, that shows no parallel to Hot Fuss. These songs lack the catchy, \\"sing along\\" quialities as the songs in Hot Fuss, and almost sound \\"emo.\\"  However, for me it was an aquired taste, and after listenting to the album a few times, I was hooked.  <br /> <br />As the rest of the songs such as When You Were Young, Bones, My List, This River is Wild, and Why Do I Keep on Counting: simply amazing. Sam Flowers switches back to his Hott Fuss-esque tone (not even sure if Flowers was lead in the others), and we get all the great elements we know and love about the Killers: strange but catchy lyrics, choruses, songs that are fast and slow at the same time, unique instrumentals, and the somber tone that somehow puts you in a great mood. You won't find another album as eclectic nor exciting. <br /> <br />This album is incredible. If you loved Hot Fuss, you will love the second half of the album, and embrace their new sound in the first half.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|If you have never heard of Nightwish, I'm afraid to say that you are missing out on some great music. I've been a fan of foreign gothic metal-type stuff for a little while now, and I have to say that this is probably the best band I've heard in a long time (second only to Kamelot). Their music is just so soaring and orchestral that it can give you chills. I own Wishmaster and Once, and I have to say that Once trumps anything that they have previously recorded. Lead singer Tarja Turunen (God bless her) is at her utmost highest this time around. It made me extremely sad when I heard that she was fired from Nightwish after their last concert. They will probably never find a vocalist that talented ever again. But, getting back to the review at hand. Once is chock full of songs that will tickle your ear with delight. I am NOT over-exaggerating - I cannot think of more than one or two songs that just don't really do it for me. \\"Romanticide\\" and \\"Dead Gardens\\" don't seem like the blockbuster hits I'm used to with Nightwish. But songs like \\"Dark Chest of Wonders\\", \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\", and \\"The Siren\\" easily make up for these shortcomings. The best song on this CD, probably the best song they have ever recorded, is \\"Ghost Love Score\\". I can almost guarantee that you will never encounter such an epic, soaring piece of music in your life. It's so magical to me that it just sends shivers down my spine. And music rarely does that to me. <br /> <br />In conclusion: <br /> <br />Nightwish is the sort of band that deserves more attention. Unfortunately, they have a bigger following overseas, as will probably always be the case. But it would be a tragedy if you, the reader, never encountered such a masterpiece. Listen to some samples online, buy it, turn the sound up as loud as it will go, and enjoy this album. I guarantee you will.
B000002I53|5.0|I'd point a new listener to either Giant Steps or A Love Supreme, but this is a great record in its own right. The title track is the big-name tune, a cover of the show tune that Trane made into a jazz standard thanks to his great work with the soprano sax. But Not For Me also is a first-rate reading of the jazz standard. I never cared much for Summertime (unless it was Janis Joplin's version, that is), but Trane's reading is decent, though at eleven minutes it overstays its welcome. But the album-closing Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye is a cool melodic ballad. If you're looking for Trane's brilliant compositions, or free-jazz innovations, you won't get any here. But if you want to hear his raw talent with the sax, this is a good place.
B000002JOH|5.0|Pantera has always been at the top of my list of hard-rockin' bands that I play at their loudest. I love to drive my Impala by the high schools with this CD turned way up. Man, I just blow the minds of everyone that sees me. They're all like, \\"What's up with that?\\" \\"Why so loud?\\" And I'm all like, if you got it you need to rock it. Those fools won't ever understand what it means to need to rock. Hey, I'm not judging them or nothing, I just think it's an ignorance thing on their part. Like, they haven't been exposed to enough good music to be able to figure out that the cripe the play on the radio is for losers and hip-hop is just awful. So, to all those reading this who like to rock I give it my highest rating!
0446528056|3.0|I love Nicholas Sparks and I was not as thrilled with his two previous novels, \\"True Believer\\" and \\"At First Sight\\". This book was more like the Sparks I know but still seemed to be lacking something for me that I can't quite put my finger on. It held my interest though and I still enjoyed it but his earlier books are definitely better. This one doesn't seem to have the substance to be made into a movie as some of his other books have. I could be proved wrong however.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Never before has music touched my heart in such a powerful way. When I first saw Wicked, I was absolutely blown away by the wit, wisdom, and magic that the show had. This is a true American masterpiece and I thank Stephen Schwartz for bringing this phenomenal music into the world. All of the songs are amazing, all of them. Idina Menzel's voice is empowering and magnificent, Kristen Chenoweth's soprano is whimsical and in Popular, she is bubbly and fun and fantasitic. The Wizard brings in his share of tunes, Sentimental Man and Wonderful, both stunning. Fiyero's voice is tender and strong and his Dancing Through Life is just plain old fun, along with One Short Day and What Is This Feeling. And the orchestral sections in No One Mourns The Wicked and Dacing are spectacular. And when finishing with For Good and Finale, nothing is more beautiful than Elphaba and Glinda singing their goodbyes together that will jerk tears and give you goosebumps. Buy this CD and see the play and be enlightened.  <br />   <br />
B000FTWB7G|2.0|I was extremely disappointed by this album. It just didn't grab me at all like Fallen did. It has no outstanding tracks or anything much memorable. I guess Nightwish has spoiled me. Before, Evanescence was about the only female-fronted band I cared to listen to. Now that I have discovered Nightwish, Evanescence just seems useless. Sorry, but I just don't care for it.
B0000024ZT|3.0|I'm sorry, but I don't see what the big deal about Greetings is. It's an OK record, just not a good one. It's certainly far from traditional Bruce, mainly made up of spare, folky, stream-of-conscousness (definitly spelled wrong) ballads that work (the haunting Lost in the Flood; Blinded by the Light and Spirit in the Night, both of which feature great sax from Clarence Clemons) as often as they fail (The Angel; Mary Queen of Arkansas; Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?) Classic Growin' Up isn't bad at all, but much better heard in its Live 1975/85 reading. This version is mediocre by comparison. The same with Saint in the City. That leaves room for four truly great songs (the aforementioned Blinded; Spirit and Flood plus For You). This is his most Dylan-derived release, but my advice is you pick up a couple of REAL Dylan records instead, as well as a few of Bruce's later albums. He shows pontential here, but he still had a LONG way to go.
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|Felicity Huffman earned richly deserved critical acclaim and many Best Actress awards and nominations for her transcendent performance as a man on the verge of a sex change operation in Duncan Hunter`s \\"Transamerica,\\" a thoroughly offbeat and utterly winning tribute to both the diversity and the sameness that paradoxically lie at the heart of the human condition.<br /><br />\\"Bree\\" (aka Stanley Osbourne in a soon-to-be former life) is just a few weeks away from officially becoming the woman she's believed all her life she was meant to be, when she discovers, much to her horror, that she may be the father of a 17-year old son she never knew she had.  At first, Bree is reluctant to complicate her life right on the eve of her tremendous transformation and hopes to deal with the boy - if at all - after she has undergone the surgery.  However, her transitional therapist insists that Bree confront the issue immediately so that she will not be going into her new life carrying over any unresolved baggage from her old one.  Thus, Bree heads off to New York City where Toby, her son, is residing in jail on charges of drug possession and prostitution.  Bree doesn't inform Toby of their filial connection, passing herself off as a concerned church lady whose job it is to help rescue youngsters in trouble.  Thus, they set off on a bizarre transcontinental road trip from New York City to the great Southwest, encountering many life-altering experiences and revelations along the way.<br /><br />In many ways, for all its uniqueness of subject matter, \\"Transamerica\\" follows the standard blueprint of the classic \\"road picture,\\" starting at Point A and ending at Point B, with the characters learning a great deal about life and one another on the way to their destination.  As their relationship evolves, so do they as individuals.  Yet, even though we know where all this is probably going to end up, the film doesn't feel stale or forced, partly due to the depth of the characterizations and partly due to the brilliant performances of Huffman and young Kevin Zegers as Toby.  Huffman could easily have relied on mere mimicry to guide her interpretation of a woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman.  Yet, even though she has all the physical nuances and mannerisms of that situation down pat, Huffman goes far deeper in her portrayal, plumbing the soul of an individual who's been hurt by life but whose resilience and sense of decency keep her intensely focused on where she's going in her life.  This is, obviously, a very challenging role for the actress, for in addition to having to remain \\"in character\\" in terms of voice control and movement, Huffman, to make the character truly three-dimensional, has had to flesh Bree out with the subtlest of facial expressions and inflections.  Zegers provides a perfect counterpart to Huffman's often studied rigidity (she naturally fears that she will be \\"read\\" at every given moment and this leads to her seeming uptightness), playing a troubled young man with very few boundaries in his life but whose innate sweetness and capacity for love is still buried somewhere beneath his hardened exterior.  The two of them grow in understanding of one another as they forge an unconventional but potentially satisfying life together.<br /><br />There are other outstanding performances by Elizabeth Pena, Carrie Preston, and Fionnula Flanagan, brilliant as Bree's harsh and highly judgmental mother who has never been able to accept the truth about her one male child.  The screenplay by Hunter is rich with insight and humor, and his breezy direction makes the rural setting - with its shabby diners and sleazy motel rooms and vast stretches of empty roadway - an integral part of the film.<br /><br />In a way, it is a stroke of genius on the part of  Hunter to set his film in the heartland of Middle America rather than in a big city where transsexuals would likely find much greater acceptance by the populace as a whole.  It is Hunter's way of telling people that, even in \\"Red State\\" communities, people like Bree exist and need to be accepted for who they are.  Perhaps this film, so full of warmth, good humor, and feeling, will function as a small but significant step in that direction.hat, even in \\"Red State\\" communities, people like Bree exist and need to be accepted for who they are.

B000002UAO|5.0|\\"Rubber Soul.\\"  Like most baby boomers, I first heard this Beatles release as it was compiled by Capitol Records in the United States.  It wouldn't be until much later that I'd discover \\"Rubber Soul\\" the way its original creators meant for it to be heard.  Regardless, be it the United States or the United Kingdom version, this is a classic release either side of the pond!  The acoustic-base that attracted me to the U.S. version, much akin to the feel I get from the first album by Crosby, Stills, and Nash, early Eagles, or \\"Listen Up... It's The Echoes,\\" gives way to much more experimentalism on the U.K. version.  Of course, Capitol was trying to stretch out the group's records to allow for more releases and, thus, more sales within the States.  That said, songs from the U.K. version of \\"Help!\\" would surface on \\"Rubber Soul\\" in the U.S. while songs meant to be on \\"Rubber Soul\\" were destined for \\"Yesterday And Today,\\" unique American release that it was.  Singles, too, which were seldom included on a Beatles album overseas, would find their way onto American releases, but it didn't really matter to the fans who were eager to hear more of their favorite group from England!  While \\"Help!\\" remains one of my personal favorites by the group, \\"Rubber Soul\\" runs a close second as it shows the band breaking new ground and taking their time in the studio much more seriously.  John's words, George's solos, Paul's tunefulness, and Ringo's percussive explorations all make this an album worthy of any rock fan's collection!  \\"Nowhere Man,\\" \\"Girl,\\" and \\"In My Life\\" are among some of John's finest mid-career work while \\"If I Needed Someone\\" shows George emerging as a force to be reckoned with.  \\"You Won't See Me\\" and \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" display Paul's pop sensibilities at their best, despite the fact I always think of \\"I've Just Seen A Face\\" as a \\"Rubber Soul\\" number due to its original inclusion on the U.S. version.  Of course, this number truly belongs on the \\"Help!\\" album, but that's what growing up with Capitol releases does to someone forced to contend with the compact disc era!  Ringo even gets a song-writing credit on \\"What Goes On,\\" a pleasant country number that would pave the way for \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" on the \\"White Album.\\"  It being pointless to go on and on singing praises of the Beatles, a mild fan wanting familiar songs should stick with a greatest hits compilation, but a serious fan of the Beatles or rock and roll in general can't go wrong with this release!  Highly recommended.
0743289412|5.0|It's been a chore being a fan of Stephen King's these last ten years. This stellar book made all the time and money I spent buying and reading such dreck as From a Buick 8 and Dreamcatchers worth the effort.<br /><br />Lisey's Story bears a passing resemblance to Rose Madder in that both stories feature female protagonists who must escape into another world to escape the harm present in ours.  Lisey is much better than Rose.  For the first time in over a decade I can recommend a book King's written without hesitation.<br /><br />Allow yourself to start this journey, and you'll soon be caught up in the spell of Stephen King's best work in ages.
B000001FMC|5.0|I was in the 8th grade in 1988 when I first heard the CD...I was in the car with my family and boyfriend on the way to San Francisco one cold December night to walk around during the Christmas Holiday when I first  heard \\"Twighlight World\\" and the song stuck w/me for life.  I went to the nearest mall and bought the tape...lol....then I lost it and 8 years later I bought the CD, now I am at it again and purchasing yet another CD from the ones lost in the past, at 31yrs old and married I STILL get tingles whenever I hear this CD, it brings back great memories and loves in my life.  I love EVERY song on this CD and the lead has such a sultry and lush voice and she's in the ranks with Sade.  I HAD to comment because this is a favorite CD of mine and will be for LIFE!
B000J103X4|5.0|In his new album, the doctors advocate, The game establishes himself as one of the best rappers ever.  The reason he \\"name-drops\\" so much in his new album about dr.dre, is because he realizes where he came from and wants to show that he is forever grateful for Dr.Dre.  That's why in the song the doctors advocate, he says \\"I guess what I am trying to say is thank you\\".  He doesnt name drop saying how good he is or how good he will be, he name drops to show all the people who have his back and how good they are.  With that support, he gets cocky and who wouldn't when Nas, Lil' Wayne, E-40, and Snoop Dogg would defend over anyone else in the world.  Also, don't say because he is a blood, he can't make songs with crips.  Game's label is called the black wall street, in case you don't know what it is look it up on google (it was in oklahoma).  Game is trying to unite the entire West Coast together, whether they are crip or not, it doesnt matter.  The combination of Daz Dillenger, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, WC, and the game will knock out any other combination of living rappers excluding jay-z.  And speaking of jay-z, at least game can remember where he comes from, he admits that Dr.Dre invented him.  Who invented Jay-z I ask, possibly Nas.  Now finally a decade after Jay-z said screw you to Nas, he finally says want to be friends, but he doesnt give him respect still.  He puts him on a label that he owns and he is going to manage Nas's album.  The Game will go platinum and possibly double platinum in the united states.  I don't care though if he sold one album, this album is incredible for one reason, he did it by himslef.  He is going to go platinum again and is the only west coast rapper to go double platinum since 2000.  Don't say that he isnt the future of the west coast when he can go platinum without Dr.Dre, 50 cent, and even Eminem, I would like to know how well Llyod banks album did first week, 140,000 albums not bad for an average rapper.  The fact that in one day,ONE DAY game outsold a guy that 50 cent said was of higher potential than him, proves that the game will make it in the rap business.  The lose of the game on g-unit records, was the worst decision that 50 cent ever made.  The Game sold more albums world-wide with the Documentary than Young Buck, Llyod Banks, and Tony Yayo sold for their first albums COMBINED.  The Game is an incredible rapper and will never be overruled by anyone from G-Unit and is a top 5 LIVING rapper.
B000002J0P|5.0|\\"Crosby, Stills, And Nash.\\"  Pretty much every rock devotee has seen their debut performance at Woodstock in the film of the same name.  It's also fairly safe to say that pretty much anyone with a mild interest in music over the past fifty years that rock's existed knows at least one song on this release?  I was a fan of Buffalo Springfield, the Byrds, and the Hollies and hear the echoes of each group in this, the first release by Crosby, Stills, and Nash.  I've always liked acoustic-based music, and very much appreciate Stephen Stills musicianship on this masterpiece.  While Graham Nash seemed to be the member who penned the most tunes for the radio, \\"Guinnevere\\" by David Crosby and \\"Helplessly Hoping\\" by Stills are two of the highlights of this LP / CD.  Of course, it's the opening track everyone either loves or hates, but the moodiness and \\"trip\\" this album takes its listener on can't be overlooked.  I was fortunate enough to see Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young when they reunited to play at Madison Square Garden in New York.  Having seen film footage of the group in action prior to that, and from many years before, I couldn't help but think of the Grateful Dead line \\"What A Long, Strange Trip It's Been!\\"  I've been told that the group's most recent tour will be their last?  I'm helplessly hoping that isn't so, but regardless, appreciate the thirty years of great music they've given us in various conglomerations.  This LP / CD comes highly recommended!
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I just started to listen to rock music and it started with classic rock and eventually to modern stuff. my ex told me I needed to listen to the new AFI CD and I just fell in love with the bands music. later I bought the Art of drowning and a few of there older CD's and I noticed that they have changed there sound a lil but still have some of the old soal thats in there classics. so I believe its a great CD and if it helps anyone I think they should get it too.

B00005JMK0|5.0|I love this movie.  I've worn out the audio tape and was so glad to get the soundtrack on CD.  I bought the VHS tape and wore that out as well.  I want it on DVD.

B00005JPCA|3.0|My expectations were already lowered after the trailer as I don't know why in the world they would ever cast Daniel Craig as James Bond. Craig is better suited as a knight or warrior in a film set in the 11th century, but no, not as 007 - he doesn't fit that role at all. <br />I don't know why Hollywood tries to package this film as a James Bond movie, because it certainly is not a Bond movie and Ian Fleming would revolve in his grave if he sees this mishap. <br />Bond is all about style, a mystic, and flair and this movie is missing all of that. Given, as a no-name action flick I'll give it 3 1/2 stars, but as a Bond movie it's a disaster - this motion picture doesn't capture anything about James Bond. Yeah, the Aston Martin is there for a few seconds, and M is there, OK, well, but why I must ask? But I do know that I won't buy the DVD once it's released - I don't want to see this film ever again. <br />The storyline is weak, the makeup kit was probably lost somewhere and a closeup of Craig's eyes gives you the rest. Yes, there's a high-stakes poker game, but any WPT episode on ESPN is more interesting than the one in Casino Royale - and by the way what a miss the title is. In our day and age with a mega budget somebody could do so much in a production, and then waste it on this film. <br />All I'm expressing is my disappointment so that I will now watch the last Bond flick with Brosnan which was just absolutely phenomenal in comparison, and this Casino Royale I don't know why it is associated with the James Bond brand.

His nuanced, inflected tones come through beautifully on this gift from the man. \\"Back t Tupelo\\" really shines here, much improved over the Shangri-la version. The up tempo version of \\"Donnegan's Gone\\" and \\"Everybody Pays\\" bring them to life, and the smirking on \\"Song for Sonny Liston\\" shows enough grit to please. <br />This is a gem, with superb musicians playing together and having a grand time of it. Richard Bennett is a gem -- his playing showcases Knopfler beautifully. Enjoy.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|Before I get to review this album, I want to get a few points out of the way.    1. I am not some disaffected teen or preteen, I am 22  2. I don't dress in black, nor I am a social outcast, in anyway  3. I am in on way an \\"Emo kid\\", in any way.    With that out of the way, lets get on to the proper review.    After getting a much bigger audience on the back of \\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\\" My chemical Romance Return with their third release, which will be anticipated by some and cause others to groan.     Before this album, I was luke warm on My Chemical Romance, their 2nd album, was so-so par the songs \\"Helena\\" and \\"Im not okay\\", but this in my opinion is a much stronger effort.     This album revolves around the rather cheery story of a guy who is only a matter of hours away from death, reflecting back on the good and bad moments of life, though the moments are mostly bad.     This is a concept album that works, each of the tracks follow a logical sequence, and you can follow the story, which may seem a bit trite to say, but we all know that concept album has a dogged history.    There are many a stellar track to be had on this record, coming in the form of lead single \\"Welcome To The Black Parade\\" and the sing a long that is \\"Teenagers\\"    The song Mama which is as raucous and over the top as Gogol Bordello has done.    This is an extremely solid rock album, its over the top to the point of parody, but the more o.t.t it gets, the better the record is.
0307237699|5.0|It remains to be seen whether Barack Obama does indeed run for president in '08. After reading this book though one thing is clear to me: Barack Obama deserves the chance. People who think he is merely a fresh face or a media darling with charisma and an exotic background, better take a closer look. Obama has substance, depth, wisdom. <br /> <br />The reality is our country desperately needs someone like him. If you're wondering what direction he would take America, read this book. Barack Obama clearly understand the complex issues our country faces, and he addresses them with both fairness and firmness. He is surprisngly erudite with American history, foreign affairs, and economics. <br /> <br />He's also very honest and open about politics and its challenges, both personally and holistically. I haven't read a politician as intriguing as Obama in a long time. I highly recommend this book. Here's hoping America recognizes a good thing when they see it. <br />
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|and this proves it.  While not being an Al Jarreau fan, this CD has made me hear him in a new light.  They have both collaborated and delivered an awesome treat.  My only question is why did it take them so long?  The chemistry, the arrangements, the quality and the duets with Jill Scott and Patti Austin are worth the price of admission.  Bravo Misters Benson and Jarreau.  I know lightning doesn't strike twice but there's no harm in hoping for a sequel, is there?  Thanks, guys.  Stay blessed.
0393061434|5.0|This book is a personal account of who Wozniak is, how he came about his intellectual gifts, when a young fellow named Jobs came along, and what happened in the post-Apple years. I was more fascinated with his childhood of entering science fairs and learning electronic design by studying the manuals for various minicomputers. The most interesting computer story was how Wozniak created a program for a University of Colorado mainframe that was able to print 60 pages of data under 64 seconds since the mainframe kicked off any student program running longer than that. After running the program for three times a day for a long time, he got called in by his professor for overrunning the department's computer time budget by five times and got billed for it. There's nothing new concerning Apple except for a clarification on where the Wall Street Journal got the story wrong on why he left during a time that Apple was having problems. Wozniak went on to put together several successful rock concerts that cost him a significant amount of spare change, an unsuccessful business venture to create a universal remote controller -- with dual processors! -- long before they would become popular with public, and getting the street in front of the Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose named after him called Woz Way for his generous support. Of all the computer history books I have read about Apple and their two co-founders, this one is the most humane in explaining one engineer's love for doing a job well done.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|We loved this show when it was on TV.  It was probably our favorite at the time.  I can't believe they took it off!  The CD set is great.  We saw the movie Serenity too, also recommended if you are a Firefly fan!
B0000CD5I6|5.0|Jethro Tull has successfully combined just about all of their musical influences into one great record.   This album will put you in a very festive holiday mood, and is by far my favorite holiday record of all time.  The flute, Martin's guitar, the classic holiday songs, and the holiday feel come together so naturally; creating a perfect blend of great songs put forth by Ian Anderson and Company.  Ex-bassist Dave Pegg even plays on a few songs, as he was a key Tull member for 16 years from approx. 1979-1995.   <br /> <br />Some of the songs are remakes from past albums, and those remakes are spectacular.   Often times a remake or alternate take of a song is not as good as the original, but that notion must be cast aside when it comes to this album.    The new versions of `Ring out Solstice Bells' and `Fire at Midnight,' from the 1977 record \\"Songs from the Wood\\" and `Weathercock' (1978 \\"Heavy Horses\\") are worth it just to hear how amazing they turned out some 26 years later.   Bouree - from \\"Stand Up\\" (1969) - is played at a different speed and thanks to Ian, it still rocks after all these years.   You can still hear him gulp for air just like always!  `Another Christmas Song' - taken from \\"Rock Island\\" (1989) - sounds just as fresh now as it did then.    `Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow' is a great song, and was originally a b-side during the Broadsword sessions in 1981-82.  All other new recordings for this album are outstanding.    <br /> <br />The liner notes are done very well, complete with photos, lyrics, who played what and on what song, and the story behind the album told by Ian Anderson himself.   <br />Longtime Tull fans will enjoy, as will fans of the holiday season who want to spin those Christmas tunes.  Get this album!     <br />\\"Hey! Santa - pass us that bottle, will you?\\"   <br />
B000IOM0YM|4.0|Been waiting for this for a long time....Check out the January 1976 Detroit show......If you want to see how truly KILLER the original band was in their heyday, check this out..... <br /> <br />Also, I was stunned to see once again how hungry and HUMBLE the band was in this period....  I think Gene and Paul ought to sit down and watch this footage, so they can remember how humble they used to be, how well they all played together in 75, and that a hungry, humble KISS is the best KISS of all......

0671449028|5.0|I read this book to my infant daughter every night during her last feeding before bedtime.  By the time I get to the end of this short book her eyes are heavy and her breathing slow.  I love the book's bright colors and sweet, short story about getting ready for bed.  I know my baby will come to love it too as she gets older.
032147404X|5.0|I love this book, and could probably end the review right here because that sums it up for anyone who is into photography and wants to learn how to get professional looking shots.  I am not a book person, I normally prefer the video version of most things - but with this book, I couldn't put it down, I read it cover to cover, learned a ton about camera equipment and how to get quality photographs.  And with the way Scott writes his books, it's a nice easy read and you'll even crack a smile now and again throughout the book.   <br /> <br />And for the price?!?!  It's not even a thought - just buy it!  It's the best resource book out there for digital photographers who are serious about getting quality shots but are just missing the essential tips - this book will help you \\"get the shot\\" without all the technical mumbo jumbo.  This book travels with me whenever I go out to shoot, I especially like the recipe section at the end.  Great work Scott!
B00005JPCA|5.0|Let me begin by saying, I am 38 years old, and I've been going to Bond movies, starting with my dad, in the 70's. Next I want to let you know I went to the 12am show, thats how excitied I was to see a new Bond movie. Next let me say, I love this movie. This is a new, much grittier Bond. After a fight scene, he looks like he's been in a fight, bruised knuckles, cuts on his face. Craig is a much more believable Bond, his body type is muscular, not model like. Craig looks like what someone who does Bond like things for a living should look like, rugged, fierce with boxer like confidence. The story is great too. Much more realistic then, mmmm, what should I compare it to, oh I know how about much more believible then a diamond smuggling North Korean army officer who transforms into a round eye British diamond tycoon, and builds an ice palace in the artic. I say keep these Bond stories comming, and Craig should get a lifetime contract to play Bond, today.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is just as good as all the other Tool CD's. Tool are real artists, and unlike 99% of all the other \\"rock\\" bands these days, Tool has real TALENT and doesn't care about MTV or all the other mainstream crap. If you like real music get this CD. However, if you are like 12 years old and only watch MTV then get Fall Out Boy or some crappy pop/rock band like that.
0312084986|5.0|What can one say about a masterpiece.  For this is truly what this novel is.  This is a timeless classic that will endure for generation after generation.<br /><br />Follow the true adventures of Yorkshire veterinarian James Herriott and his charming comrades as he traverses the Yorkshire dales in the 1930's attending to the ailing animals that he loved so dearly.  You'll feel every mile as he bumps along over the fells and moors.  You'll see all the wild beauty of the extraordinary Yorkshire territory of England.  But most importantly, you'll feel all the emotions tugging at your heart from the hardened Yorkshire farmers to the humorous and warmhearted denizens of Darrowby.  You'll meet the inimitable Seigfried Farnon, James's veterinary partner, whose constant contradictions nevertheless fail to conceal a heart truly without malice of any kind and filled with love and generosity.  You'll meet Seigfried's brother, Tristan, with his, shall we say, overly relaxed view of life.  There's also Helen, the woman who captures James's heart and the hysterically funny Granville Bennett whose eating and drinking prowess is not to be outdone by anyone.  Yes, there are these lively characters and more that pepper the pages of this work of literary genius.<br /><br />But most of all, this novel will leave you with the warmest and coziest of feelings.  From the blazing fires in the drawing rooms to the shivering winter nights spent delivering precious new animal lives, you'll be drawn into this world of delight and joy.  Don't miss the opportunity of a lifetime to own this enchanting marvel!<br /><br />Smash B
B000JLTRKE|4.0|Compared to the visceral power of the documentary-like \\"United 93\\", maverick filmmaker Oliver Stone atypically goes a more traditional route in focusing his 2006 film on the two police officers who were able to survive the collapse of the World Trade Center at Ground Zero. Instead of going for an emotional gut-punch on a broad canvas, the controversial filmmaker plays it safe by depoliticizing the film from possible conspiracy theories and emphasizing far more on the personal impact. The result still works powerfully, but the movie sometimes feels myopic in making the rest of the day's tragedies a mere backdrop for the central story. Moreover, screenwriter Andrea Berloff, working from the remembrances of the real people, brings a certain TV-movie-level predictability to the narrow focus of the plot despite the devastating power of key scenes.<br /><br />The movie takes advantage of the audience's knowing anticipation of the events at the beginning, but Stone blessedly doesn't exploit the tragedies more than necessary. While he incorporates global reaction to the events, the story quickly hones in on John McLoughlin, who leads a volunteer brigade of four Port Authority officers to the site. In the midst of their evacuation efforts, they find themselves buried in the rubble with McLoughlin and Will Jimeno the only two who survive under several feet of debris. The film then alternates between the dark desperation of the two immobilized men and the agonizing waiting game experienced by their families. There is no getting around the harrowing personal drama unfolding, and Stone is careful not to step out of bounds when it comes to the heroism displayed that day by all the real-life characters shown.<br /><br />The acting is quite sturdy and well-grounded. After a long drought since \\"Adaptation\\", Nicolas Cage plays the taciturn McLoughlin economically, while Michael Pe&ntilde;a, who provided the most riveting moments in the otherwise manipulative \\"Crash\\" last year, brings an honest combination of ebullience and poignancy to Jimeno. Even though the wives are decidedly secondary roles here, Maria Bello continues to gain stature in her gritty portrayal of McLoughlin's wife Donna, while Maggie Gyllenhaal plays closer to the vest as Jimeno's pregnant wife Allison. As the rescuers, Michael Shannon plays former Marine Dave Karnes with steely, singular resolve, and Stephen Dorff and Frank Whaley make vivid impressions as fireman Scott Strauss and reactivated paramedic Chuck Serieka, respectively. Seamus McGarvey contributed the evocative cinematography, and Jan Roelfs' production design is piercingly accurate to our collective memories of how Ground Zero looked on that fateful day. It's a fine, moving drama in many ways but in certain respects, too safe in Stone's hands.on of ebullience and poignancy to Jimeno.

B000EPFVCS|4.0|What do I like about Alistair Reynolds books?  As an intelligent person, but not an intellectual, I marvel at the imagination required to build worlds and factions, future technology and depth of story. I look for detail, a slow build, a gradual unravelling of information throughout the long journey ( not the space chases, but the reading of the book ). I look for believable characters that for a short period become part of your life. <br /> <br />I don't EXPECT an A.R. novel to be a literary masterpiece. I am not sure I would know one even if I read it (unless some high brow told me it was one!).. I am simply looking for a story that makes sense, leads me into situations and worlds that I would not be able to imagine, that creates technologies and cultures that take me away from the \\"9 to 5\\", and makes me yearn to know what will happen next.  <br /> <br />I am a simple guy, not primarily looking for similarities and comparisons, not looking to make judgements on everything from writing style to plot holes. ... just whether I enjoyed the ride for a few days <br /> <br />Century Rain did it for me in spades. The concept of E2 leads to far more possibilities and questions than one book could hope to cover, and surely that in itself is enough to suggest the basic idea behind the book was brilliant? That is why the ending, with a raft of possible options for Reynolds to pick, was so enjoyable. <br /> <br />Yes, the pacing is patchy, there may be a few too many clichés, and \\"phew\\" that was TOO close\\" moments, but that is what happened in THIS story. <br /> <br />References to \\"Casablanca\\"?  They are only relevant if you know Casablanca intimately enough to recognise any homage. Sorry I missed them guys, but what the hell, it did not lead to a lessening of the enjoyment of this novel.... Just the reverse, by the sounds of it ! <br /> <br />Poor ending ?. Not in the version of the book I read. With all the negative feedback on Reynolds endings, you now tend to reach the last few pages of his books with a sense of \\"oh, boy, we are getting close to the point where he whole of the rest of the book will be judged\\". I have to say I thought the ending was superb. No story wraps itself up perfectly and in my mind, if it does, it lessens itself greatly. This story ending was a more than adequate \\"warm down\\" ..  and left me to ask questions and continue to think about what the characters might have done in the future. <br /> <br />I am not criticising anyone who Is able to pull apart a book like this, spot every failing, cliché, or inanity, but I would suggest that the idea behind this sort of book is to suspend belief and lose yourself for a few days... and that is why I will continue to buy all of A.R. books..... some of which, surprise surprise, are better than others   <br />

0802130208|3.0|I read this book at the behest of my wife, who has wonderful taste in literature.  She told me that the book is hilarious and that she laughed out loud reading it.  Having just finished re-reading the Heart of Darkness, I thought, \\"Why not, I could use a laugh.\\" <br /> <br />Let me first say that Toole was a fine writer, and his ability to describe people and places impressed me.  However, I found nothing about this book funny.  Ignatius seems to suffer from some sort of borderline personality disorder, and almost every other character is pathetic and caricatured.  Their antics are not amusing, but sad.  Before you respond that the caricatures were deliberate, the caricatures may have been amusing when the book is written, but I do not feel they have aged well in the 30 odd years since the book was written. <br /> <br />So did I laugh?  No. Is this book hilarious? I don't think so (and frankly, I am easily amused). Reading this book made me sad.  So to cheer myself up, I am going to read an author who makes disfunction truly hilarious: David Sedaris.
B00005JNRY|5.0|Cars is one of those movies that only Pixar would dare to undertake.  Whereas many of Pixar's past successes have been copied by other studios, Cars is a concept that stands alone.  The attention to detail in Cars, in everything from the motion of the vehicles to the breathtaking settings and animation, is simply astounding.  When Pixar decides to create a movie, they do it right.  They do their research and it pays off. <br /> <br />With Cars, Pixar has created a world  populated solely by vehicles; a world in which machines not only have faces-- but have real heart and soul.  Pixar's mechanical world is fleshed out enough to suspend disbelief without insulting or eliminating the need for the audience's imagination.   <br /> <br />The concept of anthropomorphic cars without humans may not sit perfectly in a logical sense, but that's okay-- Much of the movie's unique charm would have been lost with the inclusion of humans. The world of Cars is an alternate interpretation of our own-- it's a \\"what if?\\" world. After all, we spend so much time in our vehicles that to someone looking in from the outside, it might appear as though the vehicles were the actual beings inhabiting the Earth rather than the humans within them.  Somehow, Cars makes surprising sense... perhaps in some ways even moreso than the world that we do live in. <br /> <br />Every scene in Cars advances the movie's purpose and the development of each character, and every voice-- even every spoken line-- does the same.  Cars is simply really touching. There are plenty of laughs throughout, but the real charm of the movie is its heart.  Cars isn't about cheap comedy; it's a movie that makes you genuinely smile if you let it.  The characters are diverse and surprisingly realistic, and the character interaction is unparalleled.  The message of the movie is not subtle or terribly complex, but it's real.  The story isn't anything completely revolutionary, but it's incredibly well polished and superbly executed-- without being overly predictable.   <br /> <br />Cars is one of the few movies I've ever felt the desire to watch multiple times just to fully experience all of the detail and heart infused into every scene.  To be honest, I'm not a big car guy (I probably wouldn't know an automotive joke if it hit me in the face), I've never cared a lick about racing, and I don't have any emotional ties or great interest in the history of the midwest... yet I absolutely love this movie.  <br /> <br />If nothing else, I think that says a lot. <br /> <br /> <br />As for the DVD itself, I'm hoping for a 2-disk set in the near future, as this release is sadly lacking in the bonus feature department.
0553213105|5.0|...This book is a romance, and I liked it.<br />My only excuse is, it's a CLASSIC romance!<br />I loved it, in fact. It's on my Top Ten Favorite Books list. It wasn't gross, it wasn't weird, it wasn't annoyingly romantic. I loved it. (I might say that a few more times.)<br />I loved Elizabeth, Jane, Mr. Bennet's relations with Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingly, Mr. Collins (my cousin cannot say his name without falling over herself laughing from what she saw in the movie.)<br />I can't even find words to describe how much I loved this book. I read it this summer, and I'm still at a loss for words!<br />All I can say is, I'll definitely be picking up more classics. And my book of Jane Austen's works will soon be veeeery well-worn.<br /><br />Rating: Very Good
B000I5X824|5.0|I have every Staind cd including \\"Tormented\\" and I love the songs they chose for this album.  This is one that you can put into the cd player and listen to the whole thing!  In my opinion, they could not do a bad song even if they tried...they're to f*cking awesome.
0156012197|5.0|I' ve read this book at different times in my life, and every time i' ve read it it has hit me in a different way, it is the kind of book that leaves you with THAT feeling, and gets you to think what really IS important in life, many times, we tend to forget those things, as the books says, we tend to forget that once we were children, sometines we forget our inner child.. definitely i'd want my children to read it like i did, when i feel sad or lost, I turn to it. One of my favorite books.
B0007Y08QA|3.0|First, I was amazed at the dedication of Christian Bale to fit into his part. His emaciated body will shout at you from the very start. His character's efforts to move along with his life, despite his horribly desperate disadvantages, will move you to figure out what's going on in this frustrating, but engaging tale of what can happen to a man when lack of sleep starts messing with his ability to see things objectively. Bale, as the lead character, carries the movie on his own. A well-done piece of work, be ready for an intense, psychological roller coaster ride.

0517123207|5.0|I read this book for the first time in 1964 when I was 15 and I kept that copy all these years on my bookshelf. Recently I bought a new copy and read it cover to cover over a weekend. It's really one of the most beautiful books ever written in English. What must it have been like to read it when it first came out?! I guess bewilderment and awe.  <br /> <br />Everyone should read this book. It is inspirational.
B00000D9TK|5.0|I really feel that you do not have to know French to \\" feel\\" this album. In this sense its a album that transcends language. Don't be afraid IF you do not speak French! If you are a purest then this ranks right up there with the magesty that the voice of Edith Piaff commanded in her day. Yes of course Dion is \\" modern day\\" but what is astounding is her command of her gift. The tenor of her voice shifts in multiple fashion within the songs. I beleive that you can actually feel the emotions without understanding a word. You know its from the heart....and the control is exquisite. I much prefer Dion in French. At times her voice in English can feel rushed and pressured BUT when singing in French, it is her \\"voice\\" that becomes universal.  She achieves a depth that, for me at least, is not achieved in English.  DONT BE SCARED OFF.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|I ordered the standard definition Ultimate Collectors Edition. They sent it in an envelope! The metal box was half destroyed, naturally. Then I realize they had sent me the HD version! I rate the movie and the release 5 stars, but I am seriously ticked off at Amazon.<br /><br />My advice, order it somewhere else. The teenage chimps they have working in their warehouses obviously can't read.
B0001932ZA|3.0|I just read an advance copy of a very funny,<br />comically gory novel called THE GAME.[[ASIN:1601640013 The Game]] It's<br />about a game show that ends up being about<br />murder. Almost twenty years ago, in this movie,<br />Arnold Schwarzenegger is the guest of honor<br />on a game show where the contestants are hunted<br />down by celebrity killers and dispatched<br />before your very eyes. This provides the<br />setting for the stuff that packs 'em in to<br />Schwarzenegger movies: high-tech special<br />effects, killing and general mayhem.<br /><br />It also provides director Paul Michael Glaser<br />with the chance for a wicked sendup of<br />television and its place in the moral universe.<br />He and screenwriter Steven de Souza have<br />created a burlesque of telehype that is<br />both marvelously comic and uncomfortably<br />apt. The movie is a little too long and it's<br />a pity that the restored version wasn't<br />trimmed a bit. Some of the dialog is wooden<br />and predictable, but the calculated excesses<br />of the game show host (Richard Dawson<br />who emceed Family Feud) are the perfect<br />frame for the physical excesses of Arnold<br />the Giant.<br /><br />That the same target should be available<br />after twenty years is a tribute to the<br />persistence of televised cheap thrills.<br />I guess we should all be grateful.<br /><br />--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE<br />and the forthcoming novel bang-BANG from Kunati Books.
B00005JPCA|5.0|I just got back from viewing the James Bond movie Casino Royale at the Harkins 16 theater in Bricktown.<br /><br />My history of James Bond movies dates back to the early 80s when I saw For Your Eyes Only on HBO as a ten year old boy.  For Your Eyes Only still ranks up as one of my favorites (along with From Russia with Love and the Living Daylights).  From then on, James Bond became more than a movie, it defined my movie going tastes.<br /><br />Casino Royale stars a new Bond, played by Daniel Craig.  Forget what your opinion is after viewing the commercials.  He is Bond through and through.  Also, you'll view him as Bond, but you'll be able to separate him from the other actors.  This movie is a reboot of the series.  It takes you back to before Bond became the Bond we know and love.  This movie shows his formation.  The movie doesn't show Bond after Brosnan, it shows him before Connery.  Starting with Goldeneye, I told myself that, \\"man, that movie was awesome,\\" because it was a Bond movie, and they just HAD to be awesome didn't they?  Well, some of the recent ones were good.  Some weren't (I haven't seen Die Another Day completely since the theaters.).  Craig's Bond is different.  He makes mistakes.  He doesn't think things through.  It's fun to see his mistakes and know the experienced Bond wouldn't do those things.  At one moment, when it looks like Bond has failed, Bond is ready to strike back and kill, when common sense says he should do something else.  Only other, more experienced spies can stop him, and they do.<br /><br />So, with the movie fresh on my mind, I think this is one of the best, and I think that opinion will hold up through time.  For starters, this movie isn't about a laser pulse that can destroy electricity, an atomic bomb that will blow up Hong Kong or the oil supply, or a machine that can harness the sun.  This movie is about a man who finances the world's terrorists and in order to raise money, he's hosting a poker game.  It's a simple spy story.  As said before, Craig is awesome.  The one-liners and puns aren't as blatant as earlier movies, but Bond is still witty.  He also cares a lot, is more human, and suffers some remorse at the actions his jobs call him to do.  This Bond is on the verge.  At times, he shows heart and compassion, and at times he can be cold blooded.  The person that can draw him out is the beautiful Vesper Lynd, played by Eva Green.  Eva Green is beautiful, as a scene shown where she stands in front of the mirror without makeup will prove, her face is perfect.  (I caught a glimpse of her in the movie Dreamers on the Independent Film Channel, and the rest of her isn't bad either.)  She is tough, yet vulnerable, and her character will leave a mark on you for awhile.<br /><br />Now, what makes this a great \\"Bond\\" movie, and not just a great action movie.  As far as the action goes, it is great stuff.  There are fights on cranes, in stairwells, in collapsing buildings and at airports.  Bond fans will want to know, does the movie have the stuff that makes Bond movies great?<br /><br />Considering the music, and specifically the Bond theme, many people say Goldeneye is one of the best Bond movies.  I specifically remember that movie as being one that went away from the traditional Bond theme.  They didn't use it once!  So while it might have been a good movie, it was a poor Bond movie.  In this film, the Bond music is there, though not as much as usual.  But you can expect that, because Bond doesn't become \\"Bond\\" until the end.  The traditional \\"gun-barrel\\" opening is also a bond staple, something that usually opens every Bond film.  This movie opens without it, and I was disappointed, but then it is showcased in a different way, and that makes it even better.  As mentioned above, the wit is there, just not focused upon as much.<br /><br />This is an intense PG-13, movie.  There is not any nudity, despite what the MPAA says.  The language is fine, the violence is plentiful, but notgory.  I echo other reviews I've read when I say I'm ready for a sequel.  This is the kind of movie that could start a series, even if it was the first, not the 21st.  I hope this movie makes gobs of money because it is that much better than Die Another Day.tiful, but not gory.  I echo other reviews I've read when I say I'm ready for a sequel.

B000069HP6|3.0|So why isn't this film more memorable?  The sets are on the level of \\"2001,\\" the costuming and special effects are on par with \\"Space: 1999,\\" the casting is a nice gaggle of former A list actors on the decline, and the film has three of the most memorable robots in Sci-Fi-dom.  With all of these things go for the film, not to mention the power of the Disney name and distribution, why was it a thud?<br /><br />First, the tone is dark for a Disney film--remember \\"The Black Cauldron\\"?  The main character, Dr Reinhardt, is the space cadet version of Nemo and Ahab.  The cast merely reacts to him, and then gets away by the skin of their teeth.  But at no time do they turn the tables on the good doctor.  Thus, there is no hero, although there are individual moments of heroics of the film. The only person you can really cheer is VINCENT.<br /><br />Additionally, despite having such a big cast, there is no chemistry between the actors, and therefore no chemistry with the characters.  This film is too asexual, even for pulp.  You just see conflict between Durant and McCrae, and after Durant's murder, McCrae spends the rest of the film being drug around the USS Cygnus by Captain Holland.  But not even a courtesy kiss.<br /><br />Thirdly, the ending is weirder than \\"2001.\\"  There is no closure, and no sense to the movie.  OK--I get the idea that Maximilian and Dr. Reinhardt got to hell, and get fused into one body ala Dante. And that the Good Guys make their way to heaven, then out a white hole. But this does not follow logically form the premise of the film.  I get the feeling I am seeing an off-beat \\"Left Behind\\" film.<br /><br />But that is what we have with the film. I am still unsure how to salvage the film--a part II that deals with the recovery of the recovery crew?  Or just re-imagine the film for a new franchise.  Or did they do that already with \\"Event Horizon\\"?
B000AP04L0|5.0|Most comedies are not funny; \\"Office Space\\" is good enough to buy and see repeatedly. Mike Judge pours scorn on a cornucopia of common, yet dreadful, elements of American office culture: programmers stuck with dull make-work jobs replacing 2-digit years with all four digits, or \\"taking the specifications from the customer down to the engineers;\\" bosses who muddle their communications with employees using empty pleasantries (\\"Hey, Milton, how's it going?\\")and euphemized directives (\\"Uhhh...I'm going to need you to go ahead and come on in tomorrow...so if you could just go ahead and do that from now on, that would be great. Okay...?\\") and who think \\"Hawaiian Shirt Day\\" boosts morale.  Every office also has at least one gadget that justifies a Luddite reaction; especially one that displays the infamous and non-descript \\"PC LOAD LETTER\\" warning. In spite of policies designed to enforce a quiet, collegial and productive atmosphere, somehow there are always employees with irritating habits that go unchecked: \\"Corporate accounts payable, Nina speaking? Just a moment! Corporate accounts payable, Nina speaking? Just a moment!\\" Corporate names like Initech and Initrode themselves reinforce the banality of life within their cultures. The ridiculous twists (\\"I'm cheating on you!!\\", \\"Conjugal visits? Not that I know of.\\") make this film a cult classic.
B000ATQYT2|1.0|The heart and meaning of this film has been removed in an edit choice directed at a bland audience.  The Muppets are Not standard Disney characters.  Jim Henson always gave them a tiny bit of an edge that made their work shine and be accessible to all ages.  I am tired of Disney's marketing department making bad decisions that Ruin art.  My years old LaserDisc will continue to be played each year in December until they are Fired and someone who cares about film comes in to makes Smart decisions.  If Disney wants to release a bland Christmas Carol, they should buy the rights to the 'Family Circus' and animate it into the ultimate white bread, politically correct travesty.  I fear for the future of the art that the Disney Corporation owns.
B000001DQI|5.0|This is one of many great albums by Elton John, even if you've never heard some of the songs on this album I would highly recommend buying this one. From Grey Seal to Harmony to of course the ones that got much more radio time like the title song and saturday nights alright for fighting. Anyone who is a fan of EJ should so have this one in their collection.
B00003CXI1|5.0|By the time that Harry Potter & The Sorcerer's Stone hit DVD, I was probably the last person on the planet that hadn't seen the movie or even read any of the four books that were out by that time. I finally watched the first movie when I was house sitting for a friend. I'll admit I watched just to see what all the fuss was about. Two and a half hours later I was hooked. The movie captivated me from the very first scene. In fact, the next day I went out and bought all four of the books and eagerly started reading them. I wanted to have them finished before the second movie came out which (at the time) was going to be in theaters that November.  <br /> <br />Quite simply this movie is just pure magic. It is still my favorite of the movies. John Williams' score really pulls you right into the movie. Each actor delivers believable performances. Even the kids. I've heard people say that the kids just weren't all that great in the acting department, but I have to disagree. I had no trouble believing that Daniel Radcliffe was Harry Potter or Rupert was Ron or Emma was Hermione. In fact, Hermione is my favorite character and Emma Watson captured her perfectly. Then there was Maggie Smith as McGonagall. Loved her.  <br /> <br />Christopher Columbus really did a brilliant job in bringing the first book to the screen. I can't give this movie enough praise. I haven't been as captivated by a movie since the first time I saw the original Star Wars back in 77. This is pure movie magic at it's best. I just wish that I like all of the other films as much as I like this one.
9707704667|4.0|MVLL told a bit of Peruvian history while telling the story of the Ni&ntilde;a Mala. He is very peculiar about naming streets, avenues, restaurants and places of interest, although sometimes, it can be a bit redundant. One of the main protagonist, la ni&ntilde;a mala, not only is she bad but also cruel and quite tormenting to the reader. I am not sure how I feel about Ricardo, other than I pity his solitute and lack of self-esteem. What he felt was definitely not love, at least not the romantizied version that we strive to have, but rather a state of heart that never knows better and decides to just settle. Sometimes, it even crossed my mind that this book resembles a bit of an infamous soap-opera very popular for the protagonist's beauty, cruelty and ambition. I enjoyed very much this book and I recommend it.

B0000648WZ|4.0|I enjoyed the film version of Starship Troopers, but having read Robert Heinlein's book, I am puzzled by one thing: Why did Verhoeven choose to depict the troopers as lightly armed infantry who basically fight the bugs with pop-guns and then get slaughtered? In Heinlein's book they wore \\"powered suits\\" which featured jump-jets (allowing them to jump quickly out of harm's way), and were very heavily armed. The suits were armored, self-propelled, and were equipped with flame-throwers, RPG's, machine guns, and even tactical nuclear devices. The helmets featured radios, infrared sensors and radar screens. Fighting the bugs was no cake-walk but the troopers appeared to at least hold their own. Heinlein's vision seemed like the type of weaponry we might actually see in some future conflict, while Verhoeven's was one no modern military commander would ever employ.

B000EWBKKI|2.0|Back in 2003 T2 extreme was released which was an excellent version of the movie.  Not only did it have excellent extra features, but it had the extended version which is wonderful, and a 1080p version of the original theatrical version (i.e. this one being reviewed) playable via home computer.  Now, at the time the requirements were quite steep in order to view the movie, but to todays computer standards it is minimal.<br /><br />I watched the blu ray version at a friends house, brought over my T2 Extreme edition, played it on his computer next to the HDTV, and compared the two.  There was hardly any difference and if there was the hat went off to the computer version.<br /><br />Why do I mention this?  Because this blu ray is over priced and has nothing for extras.  You want the best version of T2 you can buy?  Then walk yourself down to a local wal-mart and go to the $7.00 DVD rack and pick up Terminator 2: Extreme Edition.  You'll want to shoot yourself if you don't do it.  HECK, BY 4 OF THEM FOR THE SAME PRICE AS ONE BLU RAY VERSION!  There's your Christmas presents!!!
B000H7J9RQ|4.0|I was so happy this finally came out on DVD!  One can tell Streisand was nervous even with all her celebrities friends, who paid $5000 to her Barbra belt out such songs as Over The Rainbow and Send in The Clowns.  As the camera zooms in on Barbra as she sings \\"Clowns\\"  it is such a rare, magical moment in song, from Streisand or any artist I have ever had the thrill to view.  That song is worth the price of the DVD in of itself.  One should never forget all of Barbra's proceeds goes to \\"The Streisand Foundation\\".  So sit back and enjoy and feel good about making a small contribution to the foundation.  One voice at a time the earth can rise to the music.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|I like love stories and I LOVE Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. So the two of them together in a romantic movie, that's a sure winner for me. And it was. It's not the greatest of love stories (therefore 'only' four stars), but it's definitely very entertaining, romantic and worth watching. I agree with an earlier reviewer who said it's a great date movie, as there is even something in the movie that you can talk about afterwards. Nice detail: Dutch actress Willeke van Ammelrooij as mother of Sandra Bullock!
B000F0V0LI|5.0|Now considered the greatest American Film, yes, greater than Citizen Kane, The Searchers was always a John Wayne-John Ford favorite, but lately the critics have chimed in. Ford records once again and for all time his actors in the backdrop of an unreal place, Monument Valley. The jutting rocks placed before the camera as if an Ansel Adams photograph excites the eye.  There's much to be said for a good shoot site.  This one is the best of all time.  The framed shots from within The Edwards cabin, a photo of Wayne coming and going as the lonely American without connection to his family, a beautiful allegory in cinema. <br /> <br />Made in 1955 from a book by Alan Le May, essentially this is a story of tribal hatred.  The white settlers and the Comanche battle it out for the land and the women. The racial insanity, still potent in the mid-50's after two hundred years of murderous strife has hit the wall.  Ethan as played by Wayne, the stereotypical Ford, Western hero, except for one flaw: Ethan is a racist.  The Indian raid on his family, the rape of his niece and the kidnapping of Debbie Edwards, played by Natalie Wood as an adult (her younger sister played the child) send Ethan on a trek of revenge. Young Martin Pawley played by Jeffrey Hunter searches for Debbie also, but only to keep his adopted uncle from murdering her.  Ethan wants do an honor killing because the Comanche Chief, Sky will have bedded her by the time she's a woman.  The search goes on episodically all over the Southwest for five years and Debbie is indeed a woman in Sky's tepee.  <br /> <br />The reuniting of lovers and the return of Debbie to a tranquil America of love and tolerance envelopes all but one in the curious ending.  Only Ethan is alone in the doorway with the rock sculptures of Monument Valley. <br /> <br />One last note: I know cosmetics were important to 1950's sensibilities.  The false eyelashes and ruby red lips of Natalie Wood playing a white- woman turned Comanche and her tight fitting Indian dress, distracted from an otherwise well researched make-up and costuming.  <br />
B000GY729M|5.0|Sam's Town can in no way be compared to Hot Fuss because it's a completely different album and sound. I love Sam's Town and I love Hot Fuss.

I definitely recommend Sam's Town but not if you're looking for another Hot Fuss.
B000IHY9UW|3.0|Calling this movie \\"The Doors\\" is misleading. It would be more accurate to call it \\"Jim Morrison and Those Other Guys In the Band,\\" since that is how it's presented.<br /><br />It's always tempting to latch onto a rock legend in these rock biopics, and Oliver Stone clings like a limpet to the ghost of Jim Morrison. Acid-soaked scenery and mysticism are in every scene, but Stone seems content to wallow in the rock'n'roll debauchery rather than get into Morrison's head.<br /><br />It opens with a voiceover of Jim Morrison's poetry, as we slowly fade into a stalled recording session. Then it flips back to 1949, as Morrison's family drives through the desert. The boy catches a glimpse of several Indians by the road -- and one of them dies as the family leaves.<br /><br />Then it flips ahead to Morrison's (Val Kilmer) years at college -- he crashes a party for a pretty girl, makes arty films, acid-trips, and devotes himself to poetry. Then his pal Ray Manzarek (Kyle McLachlan) creates a rock band, with Morrison's poetry and voice as the centerpiece. Soon The Doors become a fixture in L.A. -- and then a famed band.<br /><br />But as the Doors become more famous, Morrison increasingly loses himself in the messianic-Dionysian-rocker role that has been set out for him. He weds a witch-journalist (Katherine Quinlan) but loves his fey girlfriend Pamela (Meg Ryan). And when he outrages the authorities with the threat of public exposure, the spiral starts that will only lead to death.<br /><br />Stone certainly knew how to evoke the golden ages of rock'n'roll. Lots of sex, kinetic concerts, and bizarre behavior where Morrison jumps up on platforms and screams, \\"I am the Lizard King! I can do anything!\\" The whole movie just kind of sweeps you off your feet.<br /><br />And Stone is quite brilliant with the direction. The movie is filmed like an acid trip -- shifting multicoloured skies, Indian ghosts, shadows on the sand, and eerie lighting. And it touches on other aspects of the late sixties -- the Factory, Nico, and the belief that something violent and beautiful was about to erupt.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Stone seems so enamored of the atmosphere that he never quite gets around to making a biopic. The other Doors are relegated to a frame for Morrison's bizarre behavior, and after the first half hour, they basically fade away. And he gets too enamored of his own style with the Indian ghost, and the arty \\"dead man\\" final scenes.<br /><br />Val Kilmer does a shockingly good job with the languid, unpredictable energy of Morrison. He sings well too. Sadly, his performance is stuck in a one-note character -- Stone opts to potray him just as a random, sleazy, wild jerk, and we don't get a single insight into his thoughts. Sure, Morrison could be horrible. But this is Jim Morrison as rock cliche, not as a human being.<br /><br />And sadly, none of the other actors get much chance to expand on their roles -- the other Doors actors, including MacLachlan, basically play slightly annoyed accessories, and Meg Ryan plays a sweet girl without many other dimensions. Although Crispin Glover has a tiny, memorable role as Andy Warhol.<br /><br />\\"The Doors\\" opens into a beautiful psychedelic movie, but Stone fails to give it a soul.

B00005JPCA|5.0|Everyone is gonna love the Bond they grew up with , both literally and figuratively, for some it will always be Connery or Moore. Each have their take on the role. But, rarely to you get the cold, hard and dangerous killer from the novels. The first Connery Dr. No, has Bond with no Q or gadgets, floating naked silhouettes and less wordplay than later films that better fit what we've come to expect from a movie Bond. When these 'Trademarks' are missing some purists become disgruntled. Royale does what could have been done when Brosnan took over, start over with the original novel and the first adventure with Bond. Overdue due to rights issues, one of the best, rawest 007 tales has never been done (seriously) to date (the '67 spoof and '54 American TV movie not considered canon). What better place to invent Bond, without reinventing him at all.Daniel Craig has the rugged look of a... dare I say it... a \\"Connery Bond\\", more man than model, although he took alot of grief over his hair color. But Craig is the who can utter all the original lines, even the icy closing line of the original novel (ck it out). Dame Judi Dench is so brilliant as M I'm not bothered by the continuity problems of her becoming her own predecessor. Another notable changes to the original, is that Casino Royale's game of choice is now Texas Hold 'em instead of Baccarat, which is cool considering the book was written in '53, swapping a current game the same way that Bond movies swapped post WW II for post Cold War.<br /><br />The story for the uninitiated is roughly the same, a newly upgraded British intelligence operative is assigned to track a band of international terrorist. The plan is to break up the band by breaking the Banker...Le Chiffre, who compulsively gambles with the groups funds. Bond, aided by hot Treasury agent Vesper Lynd, is to play and beat him at poker, forcing him to seek goverment protection from his understandably irrate ex-clients (in exchange for their secrets).<br /><br />In addition to Eva Green as the first \\"Bond Girl\\", we get to see Bond's first Tux, his first Aston Martin, but probably not his first Martini.<br /><br />As I said this one is raw, gritty and refreshingly free of the gimmicky gadgets and supervillian plots, away from the larger than life Bond pic of the past and more firmly set in the real world than ever before (sort of).<br /><br />This is a solid new direction for the Bond films I can't wait for more./>In addition to Eva Green as the first \\"Bond Girl\\", we get to see Bond's first Tux, his first Aston Martin, but probably not his first Martini. <br />As I said this one is raw, gritty and refreshingly free of the gimmicky gadgets and supervillian plots, away from the larger than life Bond pic of the past and more firmly set in the real world than ever before (sort of). <br /> <br />This is a solid new direction for the Bond films I can't wait for more.
0812966066|4.0|\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a unique story in the Sherlock Holmes canon -- author Arthur Conan Doyle wrote it in the years between Holmes' death and his resurrection several years later.<br /><br />But due to public pressure, Doyle brought Holmes and Watson back temporarily for a sort of \\"memoir\\" tale, a tale of supernatural curses, escaped convicts and ghastly glowing hounds. It suffers a little from a lack of Holmes, but is otherwise a tightly-written, solid little mystery.<br /><br />Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead of a heart attack -- apparently killed by a family curse in the shape of a giant dog. So his pal Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to protect Charles' heir, Henry Baskerville, who has just arrived in England to claim his estate and inheritance.<br /><br />But even without Holmes, Watson can tell that something is up -- secretive servants, peculiar neighbors, an escaped criminal, a giant quicksand marsh, and the sounds of a dog howling in the night. But Holmes knows that the curse is no supernatural hound -- and that Sir Henry is in danger from a more real kind of ancient enemy.<br /><br />\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" stumbles in one area -- the relative lack of Holmes. He's out of the picture for most of the book, and Watson does plenty of solid detecting on his own. Everybody loves the faithful narrator, but Watson isn't the Great Detective, and the book feels vaguely incomplete without Holmes inspecting clues and giving little hints to Watson.<br /><br />The mystery unfolds at a languid pace, dropping a few red herrings along the way. Doyle pays loving attention to the dangerous, almost surreal Grimpen Mire and the surrounding countryside. But when Holmes comes back onto the scene, the book tightens itself up. All the plot threads rapidly slip into place as the real \\"hound\\" is uncovered.<br /><br />Holmes' steel-trap mind is untarnished here, especially when he reveals what he figured out at the end. He's especially likable in an endearing scene at the beginning, where he educates Watson on deduction. But this is Watson's turn to shine, since he spends a long time gathering clues and even solving a sub-mystery without any assistance.<br /><br />\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a short, satisfying Holmesian mystery, which is only hampered by Holmes' absence for about half the book.

B000IOM1RI|4.0|Man people are making way too big a deal about this cd not being long enough and a \\"disappointment.\\"  First off, most of the songs will grow more and more on you each time that you listen to them. I think with a few good listens you will begin singing along just as we all did with the first album. Secondly, the CD is a SOUNDTRACK and while you could consider it the D's second album, it's main purpose is still to be a soundtrack. That being said, while some of the songs might not be that good to some of us now, when they are being played in the movie up on the big screen with Jack and Kyle performing those actions in the lyrics of the songs, I would imagine the songs will be pretty awesome.  D fans- Don't listen to all the negative nancys, this is a great buy especially now at $9.99.

B000EHTNU2|3.0|Back in the mid 70s in Germany - naturally - you liked to listen to the Scorps (Scorpions). When you were a fan of the Scorps you normally also liked the British UFO. Why? Well, Rudolf Schenker runs the Scorps (he still does as of today), his brother Michael Schenker played in UFO (and later in the Scorpions for a very short time), and both bands' sounds were certainly pretty similar back in the 70s and early 80s. However, for some reason I was never much into UFO because the sound of their studio records and compositions didn't quite touch me the way the German formation did. With \\"Strangers in the Night\\" it's different, and UFO got even with the high international standard of the Scorpions. We get a very homogeneous set of 18 tracks, initially from the albums put out between 1971 and 1976. In this live situation UFO celebrated their songs powerful like never before, and this fact makes this live album so joyful. \\"Strangers in the Night\\" is a party album, with UFO undoubtedly offering their best at that particular time. I was very pleased by the CD re-release because the sound is crisp and up-to-date. Sure, this kind of music is outdated in a way, but who cares when you heart is beatin' that way?<br /><br />The contained version of \\"Doctor Doctor\\" is the best available and was played on all our parties. On \\"Rock Bottom\\" UFO sounded very much like the German equivalent, \\"Lights Out\\" comes across charming with the customized line \\"lights out in Chicago\\" (and the audiences' reaction). Overall a simple, but solid, good rock album.

An absolute must have for anyone who loves, loves music.
B000I5X80G|4.0|I tend to fall on both sides of the fence with this cd.  I have the electric portion on boot and the sound isn't half bad and Cinnamon Girl sounds fine.  I feel cheated that Young didn't put out the entire acoustic/electric set.  The Dead have been doing wonders with board tapes for years, and I just think that Youngs hyper-perfectionism gets in the way sometimes (okay, all the time). He needs to loosen up. <br /> <br />That said, I bought the new cd and have to say that the sound is pretty amazing, and it certainly trumps the boot in every conceivable way soundwise. But. A few notches down in sound in order to get a full show would've been a sacrifice worth making. But they are his tapes. <br /> <br />If you have/don't have the boot, this is worth buying on quality alone and the performance is stellar.  One more thing. Listen to this until the very end. The set ends, theres the requsite calls for more and then, over the house p.a., comes the sound of...James Taylor?  God bless the old Fillmore crew and their warped sense of fun.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|I am not going to write some big review.  There is plenty of them already. But, I am going to tell you that in the past 30 years of buying music this selection is one of the best I have heard in years.  Way to go Meat! Thanks for the great music.
B000002UAR|5.0|I remember going to the record store with the purpose of buying this one when I was 11 years old in the late 70's. The girl who took money told me it was a good one, mom thought I had enough Beatle records already. I felt I had made a big purchase, entered an adult, older world. I heard about the record from an older cousin and it was supposed to be a big step for them. He was there in the 60s. The songs were a new world for me and I listened again and again, sometimes concentrating on the left, other times the right speaker, searching for hidden surprises. Even now I listen to the Beatles and I find new, interesting things. As I have grown with age and experience, I can 'tune' into new elements and nuances. That for me is part of the magic of the Beatles - their music corresponds to child-like curiosity and adult experience. But it isn't really only the music that does this, touches something essential, it is their collective spirit - even when the music on the surface is not so deep. This is something that can't be copied, imitated or put into a formula, much less analyzed and 'figured out'. So, buy this CD and begin listening to music that can accompany you. It is fantastic and beyond words. <br /> <br />
B000002A3T|3.0|THE BAND: David Gilmour (vocals, guitars, bass, keyboards), Richard Wright (keyboards), Nick Mason (drums & percussion), Guy Pratt (bass), Tim Renwick (guitar), Bob Ezrin (keyboards), Dick Parry (saxophone).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1994) 11 tracks clocking in at approximately 66 minutes. Included with the disc is a 22-page booklet containing song titles/credits, song lyrics, odd photographs perhaps relating to the songs, and thank you's. Recorded at Astoria Recording Studios (London), Brittania Row, and Abbey Road Studios. Label - Columbia.<br /><br />COMMENTS: I wanted to dig this album. I saw the now obsolete \\"Division Bell Tolling Live\\" DVD way back when - and it looked like a fantastic show. In regards to the Division Bell Tour - I think it was such a hit because Pink Floyd always sounded great live, they had a great light show, and they weren't just playing songs from \\"The Division Bell\\". The few really good tunes from this album coupled with classics from the band's 70's material... always a good production. The other missing ingredient - Roger Waters - having left the band in '85 (due to irreconcilable differences). I'm convinced Waters and Gilmour made beautiful music together, but alone they struggled to survive (let alone make a classic rock album again). \\"The Division Bell\\" garnered two true radio hits with \\"Take It Back\\" and \\"Keep Talking\\" (listen for samples of Stephen Hawking's spoken word on this song). Both songs hit #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Gilmour's guitar work is amazing on some songs (\\"Marooned\\", \\"Coming Back To Life\\", \\"What Do You Want From Me\\" are the highlights). While on others, which is much of the album, is mostly uninspired atmospheric tired music destined for a life in an elevator or the local smooth jazz radio station. Long intro's, sound effects, and long exits make up more time on this album than they should. \\"The Division Bell\\" delivers partially - Gilmour's guitar is always recognizable to the long time fan; some nice shredding scattered within... but ultimately fits right in with their undistinguished 80's albums \\"The Final Cut, and \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\"... and nowhere near any of their classic 70's material (3+ stars).d within... but ultimately fits right in with their undistinguished 80's albums \\"The Final Cut, and \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\"... and nowhere near any of their classic 70's material (3+ stars).
B000ICL3KG|5.0|We all need to step up to the plate and deal with global warming. If we don't, our children will be the ones paying the price for our own arrogance and refusal of the issue. Al Gore needs to be applauded for his extraordinary documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, as well as his other roles within the issues of global warming and climate change. I saw this documentary twice while it was in theaters, and will be purchasing it when it comes out on DVD to convince everyone I know that we need to take action and elect government officials (including our next president) that will address this terrifying issue.
B00005B364|5.0|Focus caught a wave in the US with their eccentric hit, Hocus Pocus.  The song was novel and catchy enough to give Moving Waves some notice, although some were surely surprised at how unique Hocus Pocus was even within the context of the rest of the album.  The rest of it is decidedly more serious and less focused, as it were.  Short on vocals (thankfully so) and long on classically influenced instrumental suites, Moving Waves covers a lot of musical territory, sometimes within the same song.  For serious prog rock fans it's a delicious cornucopia.  For casual listeners who are expecting more songs like Hocus Pocus it can be maddening.  The album's centerpiece, Eruption, is by far the most interesting song (plenty of opportunity as it comprises the last half of the album), even if its foundation is little more than an extended jam featuring lengthy keyboard and guitar solos by Van Leer and Akkerman.  It's hardly a spontaneous affair though, carefully laid out to range from somber to achingly beautiful to borderline chaos with a keen sense of musical drama keeping it all tied together as it reaches an end that seems to arrive all too soon.  If you really like Hocus Pocus, a compilation might be the way to go as most of them include the shorter, more accessible songs.  If you're willing to hang on for the ride, Moving Waves offers a wild one indeed, but a very satisfying one as well.
B000001IPL|4.0|After months of apprehension and avoiding this album, I decided to expand my collection of Offspring discs and I bought the cd. I thought I wasn't going to like it but I actually had a good time listening to it. The lyrics and music alike are considerably darker than anything else that followed this album. I also enjoyed the quotations of \\"Change the world\\" in \\"Genocide\\" and \\"Pay the Man\\" during the \\"Come out and play\\" repreeze. Dexter's trademark whine is most obvious in this album, more than any other, and his lyrics cover a variety of ranges: road rage, drug abuse, war, and self-destruction just to name a few. It's quite good but a tough act to follow, especially if you play Conspiracy of One or Splinter immediately after this disc.<br /><br />Out of all my cds, I listen to this one the most.
0670034711|5.0|I like Liz--a lot.  It takes immense courage to admit that merging herself within the conventional, traditional American culture has led to misery.  She doesn't want marriage, children or the perfect house in the suburbs and has repressed her real desire to write and publish her own works full time. Choosing to cross over to the perilous, confusing journey of her own needs, Liz, not knowing what will happen, visits three countries as she frees herself to become a mature, balanced and fully actualized woman.  How does four months each in Italy, India and Indonesia help transform Liz, the acorn, into Liz the oak tree? <br /> <br />She chooses Italy for pleasure in food and language and learns, among many things, that to devote herself to the creation and enjoyment of beauty can be serious (yet comical) business.  She chooses an Ashram in India and learns to move away from the worldly into the eternal, from the village to the forest, to seek the eternal compassion of the divine.  She chooses Bali, searching for balance between worldly pleasure and spiritual devotion, and learns from the Medicine Man who teaches that madness of the planet results when human beings have difficulties coming into virtuous balance within themselves. <br /> <br />Throughout the year, Liz finds people who help her along the way.  Giovanni in Italy, Richard in India and Philip in Bali are among the many people attracted to this friendly woman who seriously, yet joyfully, seeks her own destiny which may be imperfect but better than an imitation of somebody else's life.  She must be her own rescuer to become the oak tree that pulls the acorn into being. <br /> <br />(I not only thoroughly enjoyed this book but used it for our October book club choice and look forward to the upcoming film.)
B0009I7NNA|4.0|It is, no doubt, a healthy sign when a departure is made from a tradition that has become a mere convention through observance, but it remains to be seen whether success can be attained by so abrupt a change from the established vogue as is exhibited in A7X's \\"City of Evil\\" album. My only previous experience with this group is seeing the videos of \\"Bat Country\\" and \\"Seize the Day\\" (which seem to be constantly on the Fuse network), so I was somewhat apprehensive about buying this album. Much to my delight, this album is so drastically different (hitherto all I could listen to was Offspring) and it proves that modern rock can be more than screaming and deafening noise.<br />Rather than give a rundown of all the songs, I'd rather say just a few things. The songs run a lot longer than anything else I'm used to hearing. Shadow's lyrics are quite poetic and metaphorical, and are certainly thorough-composed. However, I felt there was a lot of musical sameness from one song to the next (the majority of the songs are hovering around D minor). The range of styles shows a level of musical sophistication that one would be hard pressed to find in other hardcore albums today. While I enjoyed it very much on the first listen, I can't say that other listeners who are used to death metal won't be turned off from this album. I do think it is a fine album and does not deserve as much crap as it has been given.
0446528056|2.0|I've always been a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, and I couldn't wait to read Dear John. Well, there was no reason to rush. It starts out okay, but then just gets more and more depressing. The main girl character is annoying and you hope that John will find someone who deserves him, instead of just pouting over her for most the book.  <br />I cannot wait for another Nicholas Sparks book, but only because I want to know that he hasn't lost his touch, and that this novel was just a fluck.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I loved this movie in every way. I actually saw the movie before I ever saw the 'Firefly' shows. Even before I'd seen the shows I found the movie very easy to follow. It's basically about a crew on a ship, in space. They have a girl on board with inhuman powers who knows way more information than she should and this gets them into a LOT of trouble. It would be difficult to write a spoiler about this movie because it has a lot in it. It was an awesome movie with a lot of action, lots of good laughs, a fast pace, some scary parts, a good amout of violence but not too much and a wonderful plot with chilling undertones which unfold throughout the film. The suspense was good and the characters seemed very real. It even has a little romance too. It's a well balanced story. Might be a little too scary for young kids but fine for older ones. I really found it refreshing that this movie went back to the roots of action and adventure and focused on a great plot and great acting rather than tons of expensive special effects. Overall, I would say this is a great movie and I can't think of anything bad to say about it. I would love to see a sequel one day.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters, Inc. is a great five star movie.<br />While I cannot, in all honesty, say that I have actually viewed it from beginning to end,<br />I can attest to the fact that I have enjoyed hearing the entire movie at least 100 times.<br />Let me explain. We have put on many highway miles traveling with our grandchildren in our DVD equipped van.<br />Driver: yours truly, DVD watchers: grandchildren, Movie playing: Monsters, Inc. over and over and over again!<br />So, even though I have only seen and enjoyed the actual movie footage a little here, a little there, I feel confident rating Monsters, Inc. a 5* movie. Then again, from what I've heard that's only hearsay on my part. ~ The Boss (Mrs. B. agrees!)
B00009RGBS|5.0|Chicago is on fire from its first ankle grabbing scene until its bullet blazing finish!<br />Each red hot song, dance and drama sequence adds sizzle to the blaze.<br />Passions flame, blood flows and notoriety glows in a showcase of talent.<br />From bars with booze to cells with bars, from jailhouse to courthouse and<br />from hemline to headline Chicago roars across the screen!<br />(By the way, if you're wondering if that was a promo piece, it's not. It's simply my take on the movie.)<br /><br />Catherine Zeta-Jones IS Velma and Renee Zellweger IS Roxie Hart.<br />These two multi talented actresses are fabulous in their roles.<br />Richard Gere as Billy Flynn, their slick lawyer, showcases his talent as an actor and as a song and dance man.<br />The dummy (Roxie) and ventriloquist (Billy) number is my favorite!<br />The choreography of both that scene and the jailhouse dance segment is absolutely superb!<br /><br />John C. Reilly was the perfect choice as Amos, Roxie's naive husband.<br />His rendition of Mr. Cellophane could not have been performed by anyone else. He owns that song!<br /> Queen Latifah as Mama Morton, the women's matron, was top notch and her song<br />'If You're Good To Mama' was done with just the right bawdiness.<br /><br />Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere,<br />John C. Reilly, and  Queen Latifah all showcase their talent gloriously in Chicago.<br />Cast, crew, writers, director, producer, choreographers and anybody else involved in the making of Chicago - stand up and take a bow!<br />Chicago is a blazing success!<br />~ Mrs. B.
B00005JPCA|5.0|You know right away that \\"Casino Royale\\" isn't your dad's Bond. With its visual references (and one characters witty tip of the hat to \\"Reservoir Dogs\\") to any number of Quentin Tarrantino's action/dramas this revisionist approach to Bond (most notable during the opening fight sequence and a torture sequence involving Bond)suits the film, the times and, more importantly, actor Daniel Craig. Craig embodies the best elements of what came before (the ruthlessness of Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan and some of the corny quips of Roger Moore with the pathos of George Lazenby thrown in for good measure). Craig may not be the best Bond (that'll be open to debate for years) but he embodies THIS Bond giving a terrific steely eyed performance with just a hint of Bond's lost humanity. It's petty brave that actor Daniel Craig is willing to reference the past performances of other actors playing Bond while finding his own niche to play the role from.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Spoilers Below!<br /><br />Bond (Craig) recently promoted to a 00 operative tries to track and trap a terrorist using the stock market to increase his personal wealth at the cost of human lives.

This third adaptation of \\"Casino Royale\\" (Bond purists know that the novel was first adapted for American television with American actor Barry Nelson playing Jimmy Bond).

B00022MUTU|5.0|First, although K240 phones old and new surround your ears, they are vented.  Ambient noise is not reduced greatly as a result, but this design improves sound quality.<br /><br />I have used the 600 ohm K240M phones since 1986.  The new K240S are 55 ohms making them far more compatible with todays lower voltage gear.  Even better, this new design gives deep bass response that I never thought was possible from phones.  Even a 32 foot bombarde pipe organ stop sounds quite real, although you will not feel the room shake.  Listening to a signal generator through these new K240S phones gives an impression of powerful bass down to at least 40 Hz.  The old K240M drops off below 100 Hz.  A slight dip in the midrange(K240M) has been filled in, making the K240S more true sounding.<br /><br />Both the new and old versions reproduce operatic voices without increased \\"ping\\" which can be very abrasive.  Years ago I started using phones to judge voices on choral recordings, resorting to speakers only to judge the organ sound.  Speakers can make some beautiful voices sound nasty.  Producer John Culshaw documented this in one of his books on recording the Wagner Ring.<br /><br />The open air design minimizes ear sweating while giving a more open perspective.  \\"In your head\\" effects are greatly suppressed compared to many sealed type phones.  When watching opera DVD I find no conflict between the phone perspective and the TV screen on DVD that are well mixed.  Orchestral sound is excellent, as is piano.  To my ears, these phones give a perspective and tonal balance that is very close to what I hear at Boston Symphony Hall, when I sit in the second balcony front.  These seats overhang the stage.  When I sing in a choir, the live perspective is even closer to what the phones produce, provided my position on stage is fairly central.  This is, in my opinion, a valid sound perspective, even if it is quite different from the tenth row center sound I aim for when I build speakers.  Non performers sometimes have trouble accepting this close a perspective at first, only because it is not familiar.  Many other phones give a perspective that is too close for comfort, a good reason to avoid the low end.<br /><br />It is good to bear in mind that individual ears are unique in shape and that phones are designed to work on a \\"standard ear\\" made with an average shape.  Phones will give different response curves depending on how your ear pinnae and canal differs from that \\"laboratory standard ear\\" shape.<br /><br />People with small heads will have trouble keeping the phones on.  It is unfortunate that although this problem has been known for years, nothing has been done to correct this.<br /><br />AKG did not change any parts that touch your ears and head, a very wise move.  Some parts are interchangeble, as they have the same stock number on AKG parts lists.  Unfortunately AKG has of late been hard to deal with, making part purchases difficult.<br /><br />Consider buying the K 240 studio phones in the MK II version as you get a spare cord and spare ear pads with a velvet like feel. Having these extra parts on hand is worth the extra cost and makes this four star item a 5 star item.ouble accepting this close a perspective at first, only because it is not familiar.

0618680004|5.0|Dawkins did a great job of presenting the current scientific position of atheism. The book can guide the debates between believers and nonbelievers.  It is nice to hear Dawkins say that his mind is open if God's existence is proven.  His book is thus timely because my  scientific proof of God's existence did arrive at Internet book stores this summer. (Search on \\"The First Scientific Proof of God.\\") A am waiting for reviews of this proof. A scientific proof of God's existence was possible earlier because the `scientific method' was found during the Renaissance. However, at that time, Science and Theology were becoming two distinct fields of thought.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this separation silenced the flow of significant scientific thoughts about God beginning with Abraham.  This flow passes through personalities such as Moses, Plato, Jesus Christ, Constantine, Nicholas of Cusa, Leibniz, Cantor, and Cassirer. It is obvious that Dawkins missed this flow.  Because of this separation, the theory of God was transformed from a scientific subject into an irrational mystery.  Fortunately, this separation and mystery were overcome when competent English translations of the work of Nicholas of Cusa appeared in 1979 by Dr. Jasper Hopkins of the University of Minnesota.  After 25 years of research, my scientific proof of God emerged from this flow of scientific thoughts. But, Dawkins was correct to say that a proof of God would reveal a very different view of the world.  A new and very different life for humans can certainly be expected.<br /><br />A scientific proof of God transforms the fields of science and theology into a single field of thought. A single symbolic language thus unifies them. All people must change. For instance, religions must think scientifically. And, science must think godly. In more detail, Dawkins must accept God as a multiplicity of unified symbols. The religious Trinity is thus changed to a scientific Trinity so that God is connected to the universe rationally and logically. Dawkins must also recognize that God and the universe (1)  are one, (2) have no beginning, and (3) have no end.  Finally, Dawkins must accept Michael Behe's concept of irreducible complexity because no atom of the universe is free.  Thus, no atom can be useful on its own.d logically.

My girlfriend is sick of my singing. <br /> <br />Beelzeboss is the best track on the album by far, with Grohl's drumming and vocals as the devil, and the D absolutely rocking. The appearences of Meatloaf and Dio were definite plusses. It's awesome to hear History on this album. <br /> <br />Hopefully my relationship can withstand this onslaught from the D.

Anyway, this movie is one of Stallones best.  It all started with First Blood and you have to see all the Rambo movies to really appreciate what Stallone was trying to do with the John Rambo character.

B00005JPCA|1.0|This review will be pushed to the back of the list for sure because i'm not among the rest of the crowd on this one.  Plus I'll get a big pile of \\"not helpful\\" votes, but I feel this has to be said: Casino Royale has a terrible screenplay, I've never read the book, but I cant possibly see how the storyline could be as bad as it is in the film. I sat through the lame 10 minute long opening credit sequence then the first 40 minutes of the movie and thought to myself, what has really happened so far?  People have come and gone, money has changed hands... and I really dont care about anybody in the movie.<br /><br />This movie could have easily be cut down to 1:20 and not the 2 hour marathon that it ends up as.  I found myself about an hour into it waiting for the credits to roll.  I didnt care about any character in the movie yet it kept carrying on and on.  The poker sequences could have been cut down 1/4 the length they are.  I understand Texas Hold'em is big all the sudden, but Bond was a Baccarat guy.  They waste a lot of time on poker in this movie trying to turn this into Rounders 2.  Hey I love Hold'em as much as the next guy, point of reference my reviews on many Hold'em related books, but this isnt the WPT or WSOP, its Bond.. I'm here for action and babes, not to watch a grind.<br /><br />They also have the lead Bond chick cast incorrectly.  The one that should be the main girl is the one that was the girlfriend of the first villan.  The main girl is cute and cleans up nice in the poker scene to do nothing more than hold up the bar in case it were to suddenly fall over, but seriously.. she's not all that.  The worst thing of all is Bond falls in freeekin love with her!  Come one, he's always been the king of \\"hit it and quit it\\".  Now he's Richie Cuddingham.<br /><br />I know everyone out there is comparing this to the Batman and Superman franchises saying this is the resurrection of Bond.  Honestly, I dont see anywhere near the presence in this Bond compared to our replacement Batman and Superman.  Its nice that they've dumped the slap stick humor, but they could have used a better lead.  Hugh Grant could have been a better Bond and I hate that guy's movies with the fire of a thousand suns.<br /><br />Possible SPOILER:  I was really getting bored when a never ending string of villans parade through the film with little in the way of character building and make an abrupt exit.  The last villan, who seems to be the most important has the least explained about him.  Things just got so predictable after a while.  The storyline is very shallow and I'm now interested in reading the book to see if it was really meant to be this dull.<br /><br />This movie left me looking for a comparison on how something could have turned out worse and I thought of one.

B00026WU7I|5.0|Of all the CD's in my collection, \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" is probably the one I've listened to the most.  It works best when you can listen to it uninterrupted, as the songs lead effortlessly from one to another--I can't imagine listening to it on the \\"random\\" setting.  Other reviewers here have provided excellent song-by-song synopses.  It's hard to pick a favorite track--each has its own attributes:  \\"Shelter from the Storm\\" and \\"Simple Twist of Fate\\" are the most poignant; \\"Tangled Up in Blue\\" and \\"Jack of Hearts\\" tell the best stories, and \\"Idiot Wind\\" is the best rant.  I always love hearing \\"Ashtabula\\" rhymed with \\"old Honolula\\" in \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome\\".  And did I mention the lovely guitar work on \\"Buckets of Rain\\" and \\"If You See Her, Say Hello\\"?<br /><br />BOTT doesn't contain many of my all-time favorite Dylan songs (which include, off the top of my head--Like a Rolling Stone, Hurricane, Isis, Joey, Just Like a Woman, and Visions of Johanna; Jack of Hearts is probably in there somewhere), but it's my favorite Dylan album overall.  The \\"listen all the way through\\" experience is rivalled only by \\"Time Out of Mind\\", but that's a different CD, a different Dylan and another review.

0156027321|4.0|My co-workers recommended this book. One loved it and the other hated it, both were intrigued by it, so I decided to give it a go, if nothing more than to serve as a tie-breaker. <br /> <br />As I began the novel, I found the author's style of writing inviting me to explore further, despite the story line's somewhat mundane beginnings. Martel is a marvelous story-teller! And when the ship sinks - fasten your seatbelts - you'll be swept off into a captivating world of adventure.  I could not put the book down at this point (although I did had to skip over the more gruesome details of feasting animals). <br /> <br />Since finishing the book two days ago, I find myself pondering it over and over, wondering which of the two versions was the true reality for Pi.  <br /> <br />As for my vote - I loved it and then I hated it, but I mostly liked it a lot.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|With an all-star cast, direction with the artistry characteristic of a Spike Lee joint, and a plot with so many twists and turns it was hard to guess the ending,  Inside Man is an above-average heist thriller.  However, as many reviewers have pointed out it is from a director who makes a habit of underlying his story with social commentary, and Inside Man is no exception.  At times it seemed as if the movie was supposed to serve as an expose on the importance of wealth in contemporary America.  From a child's violent video game whose point is to get rich or die trying, to a wealthy mogul who made his fortune from one of the worst tragedies in history, Lee makes a point of showing that all that glitters is not gold.  I liked that part of the movie, but I can understand how others are bored with Lee's tactics.  Overall, the plot, direction, and all-star cast are the most stellar parts of this film and they are reason enough to give it a chance.
B000H30B3G|5.0|Remaking a classic can be a thankless undertaking, but Peter Jackson has crafted a film that stands shoulder to shoulder with the original. Although he rarely mentions other films in KONG history, Jackson has taken elements not only from the 1933 original, but also the DeLaurentiis remake, SON OF KONG, and even KING KONG ESCAPES to forge an epic film about a giant ape and the woman he loves. It's these later films that informs Jackson's take on the love story, as the human object of the gorilla's affections comes to love the monster as well. Of course this also brings the \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" theme full circle, and makes the film's ending even more tragic. Many uninformed critics have labelled this movie \\"Jurrassic Kong,\\" but clearly they are not familiar with the amout of dinosaurs that populate the original film. Now the expanded edition features even more prehistoric action sequences and they are a real treat, particularly the \\"Log Raft\\" sequence. This new edition is well worth the time and expense, and the Kong mini-statue is a cool bonus - GET IT NOW.

B000J10ERO|3.0|Sure, it was fun to see Superman on the big screen again.  We've all been waiting for it.  And yes, the movie had some entertaining areas, but really I think it fell short of what it could've been.  A few weak spots: <br /> <br /> - Too many scenes of flying around.  Yes, we get it: it's cool if you can fly and look at the pretty scenery.  But honestly, by this point I think the novelty of Superman simply flying Lois around has worn off to the point where it doesn't merit a 5 minute flight scene with no dialogue. <br /> <br />- Characters seem a bit wooden.  Routh and Holmes as Clark and Lois: well, they weren't bad, but really there was no fire in their relationship. <br /> <br />- As many have pointed out, Superman picking up an island made out of kryptonite really doesn't make sense.  Sure, you could say \\"But he's Superman! He can do anything!\\", but you have to stick to the rules of the movie.  If simply being near kryptonite makes Superman double over in pain, there is no way he could pull off the island-lifting scene, regardless of how long a sun-bath he had. <br /> <br />- Lex Luthor: eh...  I like Kevin Spacey and all, but he just wasn't diabolical / genius enough.  Really, he should've been more competent an adversary for Superman. <br /> <br />- And lastly, one must question the morality involved in Superman attempting to break up Lois's happy marriage.  Not exactly heroic. <br /> <br />So there's a few areas which bothered me.  Now I know the majority of people loved the movie, and I'm not saying it was terrible, but I just feel it could've been so much more.

B000J103X4|5.0|Well, this could possibly be one of the best cd's I've heard in a while, and I expected it to suck w/o Dre and 50 behind Game.  While I dont like how Game drops Dre's friggen name in every song, and mentions aftermath in every song, and says the same thing in every song, the production on this cd is amazing if you're a fan of old school NWA/Dre/Snoop type west coast beats......its really refreshing compared to whats out now and takes you back to 1992 in a way.  Every song on this cd could be a hit single, but listening to the cd straight thru, Game gets kind of annoying sometimes.  However, when he is just spittin' west coast rhymes, over these sick west coast beats and not name dropping, he is really good.  You cant go wrong buying this cd, its a west coast banger and easy to ride to.  Hopefully Game gets something new to talk about on his next cd, if he could just stop name dropping and crying about certain topics, he could be one of the best.......werd.

B000HEWEEY|5.0|Although this will always be a 5 star movie in any edition it appears the  $21.00 higher price on this edition may not be worth spending. <br /> <br />The Robby figure is in a 3.5 inch scale too small to look good with most other sci-fi figures. <br /> <br />Collectible packaging shouldn't be inferior to that of the standard edition. In this case it is. <br />Another reviewer blamed Amazon for the dented metal box they received. Which may be true, on the other hand maybe Warner's should have used a stronger \\"special\\" alloy.I wonder just how many will ultimately get returned as defective before the DVD's are even played. <br />
140271453X|5.0|This book is a definite must-buy for all mystery lovers.The stories speak for themselves, but for those who are not familiar with the stories of Sherlock Holmes I assure you that they are worth reading again and again. I have a small baby and although he has kept me very busy I was able to relax when I sat down during his breif naps and read this book. I also read the book aloud to my husband while he was working on projects around the house. He was also captivated by the stories in the book. When I saw the price of this book I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is it inexpensive for a hardback book, but it also has an attached ribbon bookmark which is convenient and adds to the book's already pleasing appearance. The text is not printed too small to read either. I reccommend this book for readers ages 11 yrs to 100yrs. It is one of my best buys.
B00008RH3L|5.0|This movie can be a little hard to follow at first unless you keep handy a program of names--many characters are eagerly talked about for a while before you ever get to see them--and some of those characters make their first appearances with holes in their chests.  This kind of confusion and awkward narrative is unfortunately somewhat typical to early Coen brothers movies: Blood Simple is a little mystifying in its timeline of the husband's death, and even Fargo is a little confusing when it comes to figuring out who knows who in the crime world, but despite that, this early chunk of movies, including this one, are some of the Coen brothers' best stuff.<br /><br />This film, if there is any justice in the world, should be a cornerstone work in the modern gangster genre.  Aside from capturing the grittiness of Prohibition-era life, as opposed to the overly clean _Chicago_-esque images, this is an intellectual and emotional gangster film.  Aside from presenting a great cast (Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, John Turturro, Steve Buscemi, John Polito), this movie explores the importance of love and loyalty in the darkness and violence of a crime underworld.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong--this film is not sappy, nor is it appropriate for Lifetime airtime.  Love among gangsters is of course stressful and antagonistic, but above all of the violence in this film is the strategic-minded advisor played by Gabriel Byrne, who digs through the complex relationships of gangland to sort out deep-rooted problems for his boss.  Byrne's character distinguishes this movie so much from other gangster movies in that he is an intellectual gangster rather than a violent one.  He barely ever has a gun, and while his strategies do not always run smoothly, the movie centers around his methods of playing people against each other to eventually gets what he wants.<br /><br />It may take a couple of viewings to follow all the nuances of the plot here, but _Miller's Crossing_ is a magnificent picture.picture. <br />
B0002X314C|4.0|John Legend has been labelled as the male counterpart of Alicia Keys for a reason! From his powerful, soulful, gritty vocals to his remarkable songwriting abilities to his equally stunning display of musicianship (prior to making this album, he did background vocals and other duties for Kanye West, Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys & Twista, amongst others), John Legend is a truly gifted artist. With the help of some top-notch producers (Kanye West, Dave Tozer, etc.), guest artists (Kanye West, Snoop Dogg and lesser-known Hip-Hop violinist Miri Ben-Ari) and others, John Legend has crafted his debut album, \\"Get Lifted\\". Not only does this put John Legend's stellar talents on full display, but the album also shows his abilities to incorporate elements of other genres (especially Hip-Hop) into his brand of R&B/Soul. <br /> <br />Although John Legend fails to deliver on the promises he made on piano-driven album opener \\"Lets Get Lifted\\" (excluding the preceding \\"Prelude\\") - \\"I know you're getting tired / Of the same old thing / When I'mma break the rules / Gonna change the game\\", he says ever so boldly - that doesn't mean that is album is terrible. As a matter of fact, it's anything but - John Legend's lent his helping hand on the songwriting and production boards of many of the album's tracks.  <br /> <br />As great as many of the album's songs are, the highlights aren't that hard to weed out. Second single \\"Ordinary People\\", undoubtedly the best song on the album, is a piano-driven ballad where John Legend's raw, soulful voice sings true-as-can-be lyrics about the ups, downs and unpredictability of a relationship ; Lead single \\"Used To Love U\\", which references Whitney & Bobby's relationship, is a powerful slice of R&B/Hip-Hop/Gospel/Soul where John Legend soulfully sings about a rotten relationship and how he used to love a woman who was more concerned with her material possessions ; \\"She Don't Know\\" is an intriguing guitar ballad where John Legend tells the story of cheatingon his main squeeze with another unfaithful woman (in other words, his sideline woman's also cheating on her respective partner) ; and Miri Ben-Ari shows listeners why she only needs a violin to prove her musical talent on the uplifting \\"Live It Up\\". What's most surprising, however, is the repentant R&B/Hip-Hop ballad \\"I Can Change\\", where John Legend & guest rapper / West Coat legend Snoop Dogg lace their lyrics and voices into an instrumental melange of guitar strings, piano keys and subtle horn bursts. <br /> <br />Despite the album's strong points, it does have weaknesses. John Legend's gangster posturing is unconvincing on the lacklustre \\"Alright\\", and \\"Number One\\", despite a pleasing old-school groove and a jaw-dropping 16 bars from Kanye West, comes off as sleazy, especially when you consider the fact that it's about John Legend shamelessly trying to justify his cheating ways. Then there's \\"Lets Get Lifted Again\\", which is flat-out annoying on nearly every level. John Legend's reunion with his family on the personal, feel-good R&B/Gospel/Soul song \\"It Don't Have To Change\\" is sweet and really has nothing unforgivably wrong about it. Unfortunately, it's hard to imagine a non-Christian/non-God-praising family singing or resonating with this song at anytime outside of Christmas.  <br /> <br />Other than those flaws, John Legend has provided a solid debut album. Lets hope his sophomore album, \\"Once Again\\", continues to deliver more music that equals or surpasses the quality of the material on this disc. 4 stars! <br />5 Best Tracks: <br />\\"Ordinary People\\" <br />\\"I Can Change (feat. Snoop Dogg)\\" <br />\\"Used To Love U\\" <br />\\"She Don't Have To Know\\" <br />\\"Live It Up (feat. Miri Ben-Ari)\\" <br /> <br />Worst Tracks: <br />\\"Lets Get Lifted\\" <br />\\"Alright\\" <br />\\"Number One (feat. Kanye West)\\" <br />

B000002UA9|5.0|This is an album of early Beatles songs and is a different compilation than was available in America at the time it was released. Some were released here on \\"Introducing The Beatles\\" on the Vee-Jay lable and some on \\"The Beatles Second Album\\" on the Capital lable as I recall. They would take the British Parlophone releases which had more songs and split them up into different contents here so they had more albums to sell. There are some of the early hits here and others that didn't get deserved airplay like \\"Misery\\" and \\"Ask Me Why\\". But they had so many great songs coming out that the radio programmers probably didn't know what to do! And back in those days they spun single 45's not album tracks.

B00005JPCD|5.0|I went into \\"Happy Feet\\" feeling a bit jaded from the slew of animated films released in 2006 (those of you who read my review for \\"Flushed Away\\" will know exactly what I'm talking about). I kept thinking: will another one be too much for me to handle? Thank goodness the answer was no; for the most part, \\"Happy Feet\\" is a well-paced, clever film that's delightfully energetic, playfully humorous, and deceptively informative. Above all, it's thoroughly entertaining, containing many scenes that would rival some of today's best musical plays (if it weren't for the fact that penguins can't actually sing or dance). I enjoyed the characters. I enjoyed the music. I enjoyed the choreography. I enjoyed the photography, despite the landscapes being completely computer generated.     Most of all, I enjoyed the fact that, for a family film, the story was original. Let me explain: the ideas that were presented have been used in more serious, less family-oriented films. \\"Happy Feet\\" is formulaic as a Self Discovery movie. It tells the story of an emperor penguin named Mumble (eventually voiced by Elijah Wood) living in Antarctica. He lacks the ability to sing in a world where finding one's heart song is vital for achieving true love. His only form of expression is dance; his feet tap away at lightening speed, and he practically floats across the ice. Unfortunately, none of the other penguins can appreciate or even understand this ability, and he's immediately labeled as an unworthy misfit.    The story is also formulaic as a Hero's Journey fable. The fact that the colony's fish supply is dwindling is hinted at early on. The cause for such depletion is also hinted at; at one point, a ravenous bird (Anthony LaPaglia) tells Mumble that aliens abducted him. The creatures were big and fat, with eyes positioned on the front of the head and with odd appendages protruding from their bodies. And much to everyone's dismay, they're also smarter. They poked, prodded, and manhandled the bird,and they attached a small orange cylinder to his ankle before releasing him. Such descriptions stay with Mumble, and they come in handy when the fish supply is virtually gone; because he suspects that these aliens are responsible, he decides to find them and ask for a stop to their destructive behavior. What he has yet to understand is how far he'll have to go and how dangerous a journey it will be.     Thus far, the plot is fairly straightforward and seemingly perfect for families. However, the film doesn't adhere to the conventional child-friendly storytelling methods; not only does it have a non-traditional happy ending, it also has an underlying seriousness that isn't as obvious in other such films. For one thing, the penguin's group dynamic suggests religious satire; Mumble and his parents are part of a very large gathering, one that's lead by group of elders. Everyday, they preach to the penguins the importance of praying to a god, which we already know is nothing more than the Aurora Borealis. What's worse, they see Mumble as a deviant whose dancing angers the penguin god. If he wishes to remain among his kind, he must give his feet a rest and learn how to sing.    The satire goes further. Mumble's father--the Elvis-sounding Memphis (Hugh Jackman)--has trouble accepting his son's inability to sing, convinced that he \\"turned out wrong\\" because his egg was accidentally dropped. Even though he loves his son, he believes that, for the good of the colony, Mumble needs to shape up. \\"Don't ask me to change,\\" he says, \\"because I can't.\\" His mother--the Marilyn Monroe-sounding Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman)--is much more understanding; even though her son can't sing, she sees that he isn't any less of a penguin. Even Gloria (Brittany Murphy)--the would-be love interest--is eventually willing to look past Mumble's shortcomings. But as he will come to learn, the support of two penguins isn't enough for him to be accepted by the entire colony.    The satire goes further still. After being chased by a hungry seal, Mumble finds a new colony of penguins, ones of a different and shorter species. He first meets a small gang of thrill seekers led by Ramon (Robin Williams), a character so full of stereotypical Latin machismo that he practically steals the film. He introduces Mumble to Lovelace (also voiced by Williams), the religious leader of the group whose voice is a cross between a Barry White impression and a televangelist. He claims to have the answer to everything, and a dedicated following shows that many believe this to be true. All he asks for is a pebble as a form of payment. He's first seen standing on a gigantic pile of pebbles, haughtily preaching to those who seek answers. But from our point of view, something is not right; around Lovelace's neck is a \\"talisman,\\" which in reality is nothing more than the plastic six-pack rings used to hold soda cans. Such an idea is understandably disturbing, and it gets worse when he's later seen choking. But it's also effective, especially as the film draws to a close.    Mumble and his new friends begin the journey to find the \\"aliens,\\" which leads to a pretty interesting turn of events. Let's just say that Mumble finds them, and he sees that their world is defined by putting other species in confined spaces (ones that ineffectively recreate the areas they came from). His experience paves the way for an ending I didn't particularly care for. I found that bothersome; this would have been a perfect film had it not been for the ending, which is far too contrived to suit such an original story. Nonetheless, I have to give \\"Happy Feet\\" all five stars. I was amazed at its willingness to be different and I absolutely loved the satirical undertones.
0375831002|5.0|This book was fantasic. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good read. I started it on a Tuesday evening thinking I could read a chapter or two before bed. Finally, at 3 am I told myself to put the book down. But, I picked it up again as soon as I could the next day and the next. I finished it very quickly and wanted to turn around to read it again.
B00013RC9I|5.0|I had never heard of Air when I bought this album.  I have no desire to compare it to Moon Safari (which I now also own), so Air-fans seeking a grade on the basis of that comparison should look elsewhere.  Let's judge the album on the basis of its own merits, shall we?<br /><br />That having been said, this album is amazing.  Simply amazing.<br /><br />It's not just the songs, which seem to be woven out of dream-silk with a creamy, bittersweet sensuality.  I heard a friend describe the tunes as \\"cheesy;\\" maybe some of the themes could be described as cheesy (undying love, finding joy in spite of pain), but that makes them no less valid.  Besides, what's certainly NOT cheesy is the exquisite and heart-breaking craftsmanship.  I get goosebumps every time I hear this album because Air somehow manages to use a sort of gorgeous and liquid melancholy to craft songs that inspire hope, joy, peace, and faith in the greatness of things.  In spite of the dark (rather sexy) shadow that these melodies cast, the songs themselves loom glittering and unswerving.<br /><br />In addition to having a collection of uniformly outstanding songs, this record has also arranged the songs in an order that encourages an uninterrupted listen from beginning to end.  The tender, sad-sweet love of Venus is picked up by Cherry Blossom Girl and taken to higher and brighter places.  The mood dips and swerves and slides past creepily gorgeous corners in Run, across soothing sunset landscapes in Universal Traveler, through the stratosphere in Mike Mills, and into a cool and twinkling world of stars in Surfing On A Rocket.  Another Day, Alpha Beta Gaga, Biological ... they're all skin-rippling fun, physically seductive, emotionally charged, and achingly beautiful.<br /><br />It's a little short (especially since, with songs this good, you naturally crave more), but I don't think anyone with their sense of wonder still intact will find this record anything short of amazing.
B000I5X824|5.0|Many people who aren't diehard Staind fans may not realize that they have been making music for a decade.  So for some, a greatest hits cd may seem a bit early, but for us diehard fans, its not.  The disc includes the hits form all of the albums that debuted at #1, and went on to be platinum.  Also, it includes covers of Alice in Chains, Tool, and Pink Floyd, that only concert goers have heard before.  These fall into to the category of classic.  Played with such feeling and soul, you would think that they belonged to Staind all along.  It's amazing!  Go get it!!!!
0553275976|3.0|Tom Wolfe knows how to do his research.  In his earlier, nonfiction works, he demonstrates his capacity to observe and synthesize information from even the most chaotic of situations.  This is his first work of fiction, and his critical and all-absorbing eye works overtime; no detail is too small, no element is too minute.  This work is saturated with timeless authenticity.  It is intricate, impressive, and exhaustive.<br /><br />Exhausting, too.<br /><br />I admire the virtuosity of this book -- its scope, ambitions, and insights.  But these admirable qualities are subsumed by an avalanche of detail.  Wolfe amassed a titanic amount of information about New York in the 80's, and instead of carefully parcelling those tid-bits out in a way to delicately suggest the satire he is aiming for, he decided to include every, single, solitary thing he learned.  The story here is secondary to the scenery.<br /><br />Speaking of story: Sherman McCoy, \\"Master of the Universe,\\" a Park Avenue bond trader with a massive bank account (and an ego and debt to match) is embroiled in a political whirlwind when he and his mistress are the cause of a possibly fatal accident in the Bronx.  McCoy's world is knocked out of whack when he finds himself at the mercy of fame-hungry D.A.s, money-hungry opportunists, power-hungry politicians, and gossip-hungry journalists.  It's the story of a world full of fools and blow-hards who spend most of their energy trying to be (or at least appear to be) otherwise.<br /><br />The satire is acute and on-the-nose, but it also centers around a cast composed entirely of unlikeable characters.  Everyone from the naive McCoy to the pompous (and shady) Reverend Bacon, from the hypocritical attorney Kramer to the pickled and brined journalist Fallow: they are well-rounded, mostly believable, and mildly intriguing, but they also reek of their various vices.  Because of this, when Wolfe attempts poignancy, it comes across as vacuousness.  When the satire tries to be tongue-in-cheek, it is instead elbow-in-rib (and not very subtly, either).<br /><br />The biggest flaw in the novel is that Wolfe has tried to make far too many points, and he takes too long to make them.  He puts his two cents in, but it looks like twenty.  The story isn't bad at all, and the turns it takes are certainly entertaining, but it is a wearisome read.  When all is said and done, I feel like I have learned more about political in-roads, journalistic deception, and financial loopholes than I have about real people, much less those all-greed, all-Me people of the 80's, at which Wolfe's novel tentatively tries to aim.<br /><br />Again, this is a flaw of Wolfe's refusal to leave even the tiniest microbe of research out of his writing.  A good knowledge of characters and setting is necessary to give a novel a solid pulse, a sense of liveliness, but any real and true pulse is usually hidden just beneath the surface.  Wolfe has slashed the skin of his story, revealing its pulse in throbbing torrents.  If I may torture the metaphor, he's cut a major artery of the tale in order to show us its life, and what he's done instead is cause his novel to die a slow and laborious death.  We watch the book struggle and plod forward, valiantly, but by the end, all we're left with is a twitching mass that still wears a grisly death grin.  The ending here is less an ending than it is Wolfe running out of research to employ.  The pulse stops there.ries to be tongue-in-cheek, it is instead elbow-in-rib (and not very subtly, either). <br /> <br />The biggest flaw in the novel is that Wolfe has tried to make far too many points, and he takes too long to make them.

B00005JPB4|2.0|The film is about two things. The first is the invasion of Iwo Jima by the US in 1945. The other is about a campaign by three of the veterans of the campaign to raise money by the selling of government bonds to support the war effort.  <br /> <br />The campaign to raise money (although not mentioned in the film) was a big success and raised double the anticipated returns. The three service personnel who participated in it thus provided a greater service to their country than they did by their actions on Iwo Jima. However rather than appreciating the utility of their actions in selling bonds the three are tormented by guilt. (Or at least two are, one is grateful to be out of there) The problem is survivor guilt. A phenomenon in war in which those who are spared death initially feel a surge of elation but then are tormented by the fact that they have let their comrades down and their continual survival is a burden. The problems in this case are worsened by the fact that the three serviceman have been chosen as \\"heroes\\" because they were in a picture taken of a flag being raised rather than for anything they did on the battlefield. However the public at home does not really understand this and the three servicemen not only feel guilt at their survival but they also feel that their being portrayed as heroes is something of a fraud.  <br /> <br />The film is being sold as an essay on heroism. However it is not really that it is something else. The campaign to take Iwo Jima was probably a waste of time. The initial reason was to use Iwo Jima as a base to fly fighters off to support the fire raids on Japan. However fighter support was not needed for the Superfortress Bombers as the Japanese kept their remaining fighters grounded hoping to use them as Kamikaze plains when the US invaded the main land.  Later Iwo was used as a landing point for damaged bombers but this was never raised as a rationalisation for the invasion during the planning phase.  <br /> <br />In realityIwo Jima was the most successful defensive battle the Japanese fought against Americans in the later part of the war and it is the one time that they were able to inflict greater casualties than they received. Broadly 20,000 Japanese troops dug themselves in to a complicated system of trenches, tunnels and pill boxes and fought to the death against an invading force of 40,000 marines. The Japanese had no chance of victory, they were not re-supplied during the battle and they kept fighting even after they ran out of water and food. A tiny number surrendered after most died fighting or killed themselves. The Americans initially thought that they could win reasonably easily as they had been bombing and shelling the Island for months and thought that their fire superiority would quell any resistance. Instead the battle dragged on for 35 days.  <br /> <br />The film gives a good idea of the horror faced by the Marines as they faced a tough well trained and fanatical enemy determined to hold out to the last. It is no surprise that the horror of the battle had such a traumatic effect on the three servicemen who are the main focus of the film. However the film is not so much about heroism. The \\"heroes\\" of this battle were surely the Japanese. Outnumbered little ammunition no hope of victory facing an enemy twice as strong backed by a huge fleet and massive air support. The Japanese never thought of giving in but fought it out to the last. Of course heroism is a rather overrated virtue. Whilst the Japanese were heroic no one would want them to win as they were also barbarous and fighting for the establishment of imperial system based on racial slavery.    <br /> <br />The one's you want to win are the Americans even if they are not brave or heroic in the traditional sense. That is because in this fight at least they were fighting for the sorts of values we all hold as true.  <br /> <br />The film seems to accept that the Iwo campaign had some point. (It accepts the rationalisation used after the victory of the use of the Island as a re-fulling and repair station) In reality of course the campaign had no point and the irony is that the thee servicemen who went around and sold bonds did more for the war effort than all those who died so pointlessly.
B00005JPCA|5.0|I am a lifetime Bond fan.  I own all the films on DVD, view them on a reasonably frequent rotation, and in one way or another love them all.  I'll keep this brief -- no plot synopses, no detailed analyses: suffice to say that Daniel Craig IS James Bond, just as surely as Sean Connery was.  I have great respect for all the actors who have come in between over the last 3 decades, but this film, paired with this actor in particular, are the single greatest pairing in Bond history since Connery in \\"Goldfinger\\".  Kudos to everyone concerned -- Bond is back, he's better than he's been in decades, and he should be around for a long, long time to come.
B00005JPCA|4.0|Danial Craig gives more of no non-sense James Bond then we're used to. I mean this Bond actually leaves a woman that wants him, to go follow a bad guy instead. I can't really picture Brosnan's Bond doing that. Plus he's tougher and more rugged than any other Bond. Most of the other Bond's have there one-liners and have fun with their witty lines. Craig has fun with them too but he doesn't deliver them every time he kills a bad guy. He's a more serious James Bond and Craig and the director Martin Campbell make it clear that you don't want to cross this James Bond.<br /><br />  Campbell's GoldenEye was the best Pierce Brosnan Bond film and it's nice to see him return. Casino Royale is a lot more serious than GoldenEye. I mean GoldenEye even has it's scenes of cartoonish violence. There's no sign of anything like that here. His pace is about as slow as if he's doing a 60's Jamees Bond film. Which is only bad when we get a little too many scenes with Bond playing cards. There's a lot of action in the beginning and then the film gets pretty slow. Craig is so good that it's still hard not to want to stick with the film though. Plus I can't say that I don't want Martin Campbell to come back for the next film. His direction and Craig's performance really are a good combination. All those people that said Craig was a really bad casting choice are gonna choke on those words after seeing how good he is here.
B000IFQLLY|5.0|The problem with Best Ofs, especially single disc offerings from bands with a long career, is the fact that some really great songs are dropped in favor of some not as great songs. The fact that there is a volume 1 next to the name makes the fact that some songs that should be on here, like Blasphemous Rumors, a lot easier to accept.  <br /> <br />However, this, like all Best Ofs, isn't aimed for the established fan. It's aimed for the neophyte, and a different set of standards has to be used. <br /> <br />First off, all of the big songs are accounted for here. So the songs that people who don't listen to Depeche Mode but would be aware of are presented here. Secondly, is the album a good listen. And it is. Now, some may complain that the singles aren't presented in chronological order, but for Depeche Mode, it really helps the cause to show that they were a consistently great band. The fact that early, bright, poppy singles like \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\" can hold their own against the later, more mature singles like \\"Personal Jesus\\" only emphasizes the growth and their initial greatness. <br /> <br />For the old fans of Depeche Mode, what is here to entice you? Well first off, the tracks from Playing the Angel have been remastered. In case you didn't hear Playing the Angel, it was a really good album that was mastered very poorly - the CD was mastered too hottly, giving the album a very muddy sound. Now, the two songs from that album sound a lot cleaner and has a much moodier atmosphere than a muddy one. <br /> <br />And Martyr, the new single, is a fun song that shows the band still has life in them.
B00079FUI6|5.0|I'm 22 and my brother is 18.  He told me he loved Desperate Housewives, to which I responded \\"Gross!  You know, it's bad for you to think life is all about sex.\\"  Of course I thought the show was basically soft-core porn.  Every time I saw a promotion for it on TV, that was the only subject they discussed.  My brother finally told me after the first season was over \\"It's not even mostly about sex!  There are all these murders and mysteries and it's also really funny.\\"  So I said to him I would watch his DVD set one day when I was bored and had seen everything else.  I tried SO hard to still dislike it (because I don't like admitting I am wrong) but I fell in love in the first episode.  You couldn't ask for more in a show.  It has adventure, drama, comedy, mystery, all kinds of families and marriages, and yes, it does have some sex, but best of all there's always a situation you will identify with! -- basically all the most interesting parts of life, admittedly exaggerated to a degree.  It is now in the running for my favorite show, tied with \\"Lost\\".  So ok, I was wrong.   <br />So if you think this show is going to be Sex and the City--it's not!!  just rent the first season and I swear you will want to buy it.  It happened to me!

B000FL7CAK|5.0|It seems like all the shows I fall in love with are ones I think look stupid from the previews.  I figured \\"oh  a kid who works for her Daddy and helps him solve crimes... that's for teenagers.\\"  WRONG.   <br />This show is more adult than Desperate Housewives.  Kirsten Bell (Veronica) is light years beyond her age.   <br />If you like political correctness, this show is not for you.  If you don't like dry sarcastic humor, this show is not for you.   <br />But I do like non- PC shows and I do like dry humor, it also mirrors real situations and the cinemaphotography is AMAZING!  Once again, not a teeny bopper show.   <br /> <br />The first season starts off with Veronica as a regular teenager who cared about boyfriends and proms and didn't really care to do anything with Private Investigation (her father- a disgraced Sheriff's job)  This show explores the social devide in California, between mostly the poor Mexicans and the rich White kids.  As Veronica's father was once Sheriff, that pulled a lot of water in this tiny town, and she was one of the popular rich kids.  Then once her rich, White best friend was murdered (the sister of her boyfriend) And her father suspected the most powerful man in town (her friend and boyfriend's father) of murdering the girl, the kids at school gave her the choice to stick with her father and be ousted from their clique or disagree with her father and stay \\"one of them\\"  she chose her dad.  Therefore, Veronica is the girl in the middle, trying desperatly to find out who killed her best friend, and many other things that have happened to her that stole her high school girl innocence.  She has some friends on the rich/white side and some on the poor/mexican side.   <br /> <br />The very best thing about Veronica Mars is that each episode contains more information, clues, excitment, adventure, romance, betrayl and more than most shows fit into a whole season-- NOT a show you can watch while you're multi-tasking!  I record the shows on VCR until the dvd comes out.  <br /> <br />Honestly I would say that if you are 18 or 78 you will love this show and especially Veronica and her father.  Don't pass this up thinking it's a kid show!

B000LXH0AE|5.0|STRANGER THAN FICTION is a movie that feels very much like a Charlie Kaufman picture (the writer of BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, ADAPTATION, etc.), but it isn't. Unlike most of the films Kaufman has penned, STRANGER THAN FICTION is lighter, more subdued, not quite as surreal, and actually more realistic.<br /><br />The film stars Will Ferrell as an IRS agent accountant named Harold Crick. Harold loves numbers. He counts everything from how many times he brushes his teeth each morning to how many steps he takes in a day to the amount of liquid in the soap dispensers in the men's restrooms. Harold is very quiet, patient, and subdued. He lives alone and only has one friend, a guy at work named Dave (the delightful Tony Hale). In short, Harold is the perfect IRS agent. One morning as Harold gets up for his morning routine he begins hearing a British female voice that is narrating his life. He tries to get the voice to stop, but proves unsuccessful. He seeks the advice of a psychiatrist and eventually that of a famed literature critic and teacher, Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman). Hoffman reaches the conclusion that Harold is caught up in a tragedy and the best way he can avoid his fate is to start living his life more fully. Harold buys a guitar and starts dating a cute little baker, Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who he had just audited. Life seems to have turned into a comedy. But little did Harold know that the woman he hears narrating his life is a reclusive author who has gained fame and notoriety for writer wonderful works of fiction where the protagonist dies at the end. She hasn't written anything for a decade but will soon finish her latest work, an epic of American fiction, the great American novel about an IRS agent named Harold Crick. Sometimes truth is much stranger than fiction.<br /><br />Will Ferrell gives one of the better acting performances of his career. However, he does so without really acting. Imagine all the funny things Ferrell has done and take that all away. Imagine a Ferrell who is completely under control and who keeps his emotions from turning into unnecessary sight-gags. That is the Will Ferrell in STRANGER THAN FICTION. It's a change of pace for Ferrell, yet at the same time the character was perfect for him to play. It is one of the best performances of his career, but it is not Oscar worthy. It does show, however, that Ferrell is capable of more than just being a funny man.<br /><br />Maggie Gyllenhaal portrays Harold's love interest, Ana. I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of Gyllenhaal. I think much of her work has been overrated. However, I really did like Ana. Gyllenhaal gives a fine performance, giving Ana the wit, sensuality, rebellious nature, and a tiny bit of perkiness that makes her the type of woman that any reasonable and sensible single man would find attractive. Ana is such an unusual character that her attraction to Harold doesn't seem unusual at all.<br /><br />Emma Thompson gives a strong performance as the author who is writing what she believes to be a work of fiction, Kay Eiffel. Thompson is almost always enchanting on screen and her presence is as strong as ever (even without wearing any makeup). Dustin Hoffman is also a good fit as the English professor, Jules Hilbert, who tries to help Harold.<br /><br />I found STRANGER THAN FICTION to be a somewhat strange, but enjoyable movie. I related to the film on several different levels. For instance, I've done some writing (though none published) and can relate to Eiffel's writer's block and her struggle in attempting to stay true to the story and not let her love of her character (Harold) overcome the story and make it into a clich&eacute;. However, the big thing that STRANGER THAN FICTION caused me to think about was heroes and the nature of a hero. The movie gives a different twist on the classical idea of what a hero is and what happens to a hero. It's helped me to understand that real-life heroes are better than the ones we read aboutin literature and often see in movies. Real life heroes are the kinds of people we wish there were more of in the world, even if they do live somewhat mundane lives. The truth isn't just stranger than fiction, it's often more interesting and exciting as well.erature and often see in movies.

B000FTWB7G|4.0|CD review from the outside in...when Evanescence first hit the charts with FALLEN, it was a somewhat breath of fresh air...outstanding writing, arranging, let alone a unique sound with Amy Lee's lovely vocals...so we can all agree that their sophomore effort was excellent...which brings me to THE OPEN DOOR, a very nice follow up CD, even with the departure of co-collaborator and guitarist Ben Moody...the outer visual marketing of THE OPEN DOOR is very enticing, artwork and graphics nicely executed, as well as the interior is well laid out in its presentation and with simplicity for the graphics on the disc itself...moving on...the music...it's fantastic, but not surprising...Amy Lee has maintained the pure quality of sound that IS Evanescence, let's face it, she IS Evanescence...but I'm sadden, still EVER the fan...this endeavor is somewhat shallow and maybe forgettable...still there is the beautiful vocals and arrangements, but it's lacking the strong edge, the catchy melodies, the luster that was FALLEN...the \\"music in your head\\" that you would retain all day long after listening to any one track from FALLEN...it's appears that THE OPEN DOOR is a generic, homogenized version of Evanescence, very well produced indeed, but just not the \\"in your face\\" Evanescence I've loved in the past. All n' all, I DO recommend THE OPEN DOOR to any Evanescence fan without any reservation...if you love Evanescence, then you should take this latest creation into you heart for what it is...because there surely is a lot more tasty tunes to come...I would not even be surprised to see Amy Lee easily move into a SOLO career at some point in the future...after all, she does possess the talent, creative soundness and the outwardly physical appeal that is marketable and will sale...and so, I recommend enter THE OPEN DOOR n' enjoy!
B00005JPCA|5.0|Gone (for now at least) are the rediculous gadgets, cornball puns and outsized plots meant to disguise the fact that the series had little left to offer.  From the opening moments of \\"Casino Royale\\" when still rising British Agent James bond (Craig) earns his stripes with two calculated murders, it is clear  that the Bond franchise has rediscovered itself, going back to fundamentals and delivering the most exciting and engrossing Bond film since Sean Connery squared off against a certain deranged businessman with an affinity for gold.  Craig, a seasoned character actor with superstar charisma and animal magnetism to burn, is ideally suited for the restart.  His rough-hewn good looks and gruff demeanor perfectly accentuate this early Bond, who is still trying to channel his anger, aggression and recklessness into the suave charisma and ruthlessly lethal efficiency that a spy needs to survive.   But beyond the superficial, Craig's acting chops are formidable, and he rips into Bond with an intelligence and gusto not seen since Connery.  In fact, Craig may now have outdone Connery, but it will remain to be seen if Craig can muster Connery's consistency.  <br /> <br />However, the Bond series has been known to shoot itself in the foot with stiff, static writing and insipid direction (exibit A and B: \\"A View to a Kill\\" and \\"The World is not Enough,\\" along with numerous others).  But, for \\"Royale,\\" the franchise stewards Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson wooed back Director Martin Campbell from \\"Goldeneye\\" as well as screenwriter Paul Haggis (Crash) to spice up the script by Bond vets Neal Purvis and Robert Wade.  As a result, the writing is astronomically better than it has been in years, refreshingly devoid of cop-out puns and instead chock full of textured dialouge and biting back and forth banter (check the first interplay between Craig and Eva Green, the smartest and strongest Bond girl in years).  Haggis and co. also seem to have taken notes from Matt Damons' \\"Bourne\\" series, realizing that a touch of humanity and reality to the saga of a super-spy goes a long way in enriching character.  They allow Craig and Green to be vulnerable, terrified, and even a little bumbling in the face of the cool, demented and blood-stained eyes of Le Chiffe (Mads Mikkelson), a renegade finacier of terror who uses his clients assets to bankroll a high-rolling poker game and play the stock market, albeit with perfectly placed terrorist attacks of his own to push the market just the right way.  Director Campbell, whose work since \\"Goldeneye\\" has been spotty to say the least (Vertical Limit, Beyond Borders), is reenergized on \\"Royale,\\" his style and confidence rekindled.  He, along with cinematographer Phil Meheaux (The Mask of Zorro) and editor Stuart Baird (A Richard Donner favorite), uncork their shared prowess and deliver a whirlwind of bone-crunching action scenes both small (the opening bathroom brawl between Bond and his first kill) to gigantic.  The foot chase up and down a construction site in Madagascar between Bond and a ridiculously athletic bomb-making terrorist is a show-stopper, as is the finale in a collapsing Venetian mansion.  What this adds up to is that \\"Casino Royale\\" ranks as one of the best Bond films of all time, but it also ranks as the best action film of the year.  Hell, it may end of being one of the best films of the year.

B00005JPCA|5.0|Ian Fleming, in the 1950s, was part of the Playboy generation. Back then, the man to look up to was better dressed, more sophisticated, richer, and a bigger babe magnet you are. Connery's rugged good looks just finished the package. Twenty movies spanning forty years did a great job with that formula, holding firmly to it even as the world changed around it.<br /><br />Bond just changed. He's a lot grittier than the old Bond - but what did you expect from a killer? He's a lot more built up than the old Bond - but isn't that what it takes for all that physical work? And he's not a native to the tuxedo world - but isn't that what his sophisticated female guide is for, among other things? This Bond is a lot more believable then the gadget-laden aristocrat that we long ago stopped examining with a critical eye. The chase scenes are better, too. No helicopters inside of buildings or parachute jumps off towers and mountains, but action that's a lot more believable, physical, and even visceral. Oddly, Ian Fleming's old fascination with the gentlemanly art of gambling has become current again. Now that poker is a televised sport, the gaming table is a battlefield once more, and Le Chifre is a worthy opponent. And Daniel Craig's incidental resemblance to Wladimir Putin only contributes to his smart, tough image.<br /><br />Judy Dench is back again as M, the most memorable in that role. Eva Green is the Bond girl this time. She projects all the appeal she did as a young woman in The Dreamers, but she's matured. As good as she was then, she got better. Her personal (if not physical) strength is as intense as Bond's, and her weaknesses are equally intense. The contrast is striking. If her weakness makes her look human, then his lack makes him look inhuman. I've known a SWAT sharpshooter - that hard, sharp edge that Craig projects is a real thing.<br /><br />This isn't your father's (or grandfather's) Bond, and I mean that in the very best way.<br /><br />//wiredweird

B00005JPCA|4.0|Kicking off the 007 series in 2006 required less fantasy and more reality, and Casino Royale delivers with this physical and real Bond. I knew I was getting something good with the best foot chase scene I can remember followed by some really gritty spywork. Mix a gorgeous Latina into the plot, and you've got Bond 101. <br /> <br />The dialogue between Bond and Vesper at their first meeting is some of the most intelligent conversation I've ever heard. Put that together with the poker room bar chat and you're at 3 stars already. Having a defib machine after being poisoned is too convenient so that loses some suspended disbelief points. Being captured and tortured brings it back to reality-talk about busting somebody's balls! I thought Vesper could have used some developing. Maybe she could have become a villain, or they could have become a team. Her dying was too cliche'. The storyline is becoming too cliche'. Maybe this Bond will be the last Bond. Maybe he will become a monk. That would be interesting. <br /> <br />Bond has to transcend, not unlike Neo, to get 5 stars. That is the task for Hollywood. Can Craig deliver that?
B0001KU93C|2.0|Once again we have a stranger with a score to settle.  Of course, he is lightning fast with guns and never misses.  Before it's all over ( I couldn't bear to watch it all) he's wasted scores of Mexicans and Americans both.  Why exactly I'm not sure.  The story takes a back seat to all the cruel, unusual and gratuitous violence.  I don't mind violent movies but I'd at least like to have an interesting story to go with them.  I kept trying to like this show.  After reading reviews what I imagined sure had the real thing beat.  I mean c'mon, a guy who drags a coffin around through the desert to some God forsaken mud hole of a town, just to waste about 300 or 400 guys who go up against him?  Why it all matters I don't know.  There were so many people getting shot that it was hard to remember what the story was about but it really wasn't worth remembering anyway.
B000GY729M|5.0|The Killers are really something special in the world of music today. There are a band that uses meloncholy new wave sound that is able to put smiles on peoples faces and have them sing along. 'Hot Fuss' was a real coming out for this band but their new cd 'Sam's Town' is not getting the same vibes from many people. This new album has the fans split right down the middle. The first single 'When You Were Young' is just not getting the same feeling as 'Somebody Told Me.' Yet this group is not going in the wrong direction. This is a band like many before them that plans to stick around for while by experimenting and trying new things to see how far they can go. Those types of bands are the ones that stand the test of time. 'Sam's Town' is a real triump there are great songs on this record and even some that keep the origional Killers sound. Songs like 'Bones' and 'See My Mind' keep the fans interested while the rest are a new breath of fresh air which is what the music world so desperatly needs. So take a listen and try and keep an open mind.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|I remember vividly a friend telling me about this show.  My response was that no one would survive and there wouldn't be a day after to tell of.  Then he told me that no one did survive.  There were some who were still alive but you could see that they weren't going to live long.  It's not like some bombs drop, thousands of people die and then the survivors rebuild.  Not with nuclear war.  The fallout and radiation lasts much, much longer.  People's hair falls out, they break out in rashes and eventually die even if they survive the initial attack.  You would have to be in a fallout shelter for months before it would be safe to come out.  Of course all livestock would die and the ground may never be suitable for growing crops for decades.  This is not a scenario we want to experience.  Lets hope our \\"leaders\\" won't choose this path.  It would indeed be madness
B00005JPCD|5.0|Awwwww, so cute! Man, the baby penguins were so freakin' adorable, especially the blue-eyed Mumble! I had such a good time with this film! HAPPY FEET is breathtaking and, like the best of animated films, successfully marries a sense of fun, cuteness, and charm, guaranteed to enchant the young, with a more sophisticated, darker layer which will satisfy the young-at-heart and maybe even make them reflect a bit. HAPPY FEET is an effective fusion of music, humor, and poignancy. It's part coming-of-age story, part heroic quest, and part commentary on staid, rigidly structured societies. And it is all musical. Most will be familiar with the finger-snapping, head-bobbing tunes, including the classic chorus from \\"The Message.\\" Robin Williams (\\"My Way\\"), Brittany Murphy (\\"Somebody to Love\\" & \\"Boogie Wonderland\\"), Nicole Kidman (\\"Kiss\\"), and Hugh Jackman (\\"Heartbreak Hotel\\") offer up their own song renditions. Whether they do their musical numbers justice is wholly up to the viewer's discretion. Meanwhile, Mumble's tap dancing is gloriously brought to life on screen, thanks to the motion-capture work done by heralded tap dancer Savion Glover.<br /><br />Be cautioned that this film isn't quite in the same happy-go-lucky vein as the recent CARS, OVER THE HEDGE, THE WILD, and FLUSHED AWAY. Yes, the humor is there, as well as the familiar family-oriented sensibilities, but Director George Miller injects HAPPY FEET with more depth than normally found in animation (THE INCREDIBLES aside). This film has pretty dark sequences and several legitimate \\"boo!\\" moments, as the key characters are occasionally placed in harrowing danger, which might elicit a frightened gasp or an \\"Oh, no!\\" from the young 'uns. The vast, open, icy expanses of Antarctica lend an aura of grandeur and make the fairly solemn core storyline more credible. Now I'm not really a fan of message films - and HAPPY FEET's key plotline does hinge heavily on the penguins' environmental woes as caused by humans - but this film manages to weave its points seamlessly enough into the story, as opposed to heavy-handedly hammering it home.<br /><br />The plot: Maybe it's because he was dropped while still in his egg, but  Mumble (Elijah Wood), from the moment he hatched, has displayed a penchant for displaying happy feet, in the form of tap, an activity fiercely frowned upon by the penguin hierarchy as being quite undignified. To make it worse for Mumble, he can't sing a proper note, which is a severe dilemma. For without a heartsong, how will he find his  true love? From the get-go, Mumble becomes an outcast, an Emperor penguin forever toe-tapping on the fringes and treated with scorn by his peers. Even his father Memphis (Hugh Jackman) is embarassed of him and strives to make over Mumble into a more stately-shambling citizen. But there's a graver concern in the offing, which affects the entire penguin population: fish is getting harder to find. When the aged community patriarch Noah (Hugo Weaving) blames the scarcity of food on Mumble's unconventional tapping, which supposedly has angered the penguin deity, Mumble vows to seek the reason for the fish's disappearance and begins his odyssey. Initially accompanied by five wise-cracking, fun-loving Adelie penguins (with Mexican accents) who call themselves the Amigos and who think Mumble is accidentally cool, Mumble ultimately finds himself alone as he confronts the source of his community's fish depletion - us.<br /><br />The voice cast is perfectly good and doesn't get in the way of the pretty pictures. The ever-lively Robin Williams, who plays three characters here (Lovelace, Cletus, and the scene-stealing Ramon), is actually back to being funny. And, with CG animation that is drop-dead AMAZING and is guaranteed to make your jaw drop, HAPPY FEET is hands down the best animated film I've seen in years.ilm manages to weave its points seamlessly enough into the story, as opposed to heavy-handedly hammering it home.<br /><br />The plot: Maybe it's because he was dropped while still in his egg, but  Mumble (Elijah Wood), from the moment he hatched, has displayed a penchant for displaying happy feet, in the form of tap, an activity fiercely frowned upon by the penguin hierarchy as being quite undignified.

But there's a graver concern in the offing, which affects the entire penguin population: fish is getting harder to find. When the aged community patriarch Noah (Hugo Weaving) blames the scarcity of food on Mumble's unconventional tapping, which supposedly has angered the penguin deity, Mumble vows to seek the reason for the fish's disappearance and begins his odyssey. Initially accompanied by five wise-cracking, fun-loving Adelie penguins (with Mexican accents) who call themselves the Amigos and who think Mumble is accidentally cool, Mumble ultimately finds himself alone as he confronts the source of his community's fish depletion - us.<br /><br />The voice cast is perfectly good and doesn't get in the way of the pretty pictures. The ever-lively Robin Williams, who plays three characters here (Lovelace, Cletus, and the scene-stealing Ramon), is actually back to being funny. And, with CG animation that is drop-dead AMAZING and is guaranteed to make your jaw drop, HAPPY FEET is hands down the best animated film I've seen in years.
B00005JPCA|4.0|The studio took a big risk with this film.<br /><br />They have basically abandoned the slap-stick comedy that has plagued Bond for 2 decades and created a very close and accurate portrayal of James Bond as written in the original novels from the 50s.<br /><br />These stories were dark, gritty and serious in tone.<br /><br />Of course it is safe to say that probably 95%+ of Bond fans only know James Bond from the movies, thus THEY may think this movie is off base for the character when it is actually the closest we have seen since 1962's \\"DR NO\\" when Sean Connery played a more serious Bond in the firt film.<br /><br />I know this is true because many critics of the film have attacked it for being very \\"un-Bond-like\\" when in fact it is almost dead on.<br /><br />Okay... the criticisms...<br /><br />1)Since this film is intended to explain how Bond earned his Double-0 license to kill, it theoretically of course pre-dates DR NO.<br /><br />This presents a problem for the nit-picky \\"Bond World Historians\\" since Bond's first boss \\"M\\" was a man.<br /><br />Also Daniel Craig appears a bit older than Sean Connery was in the first film.<br /><br />2) About Daniel Craig... His acting and dedication to playing this part wins you over out of respect.... BUT............. James Bond is supposed to have a \\"dark and cruel look\\".<br /><br />Okay.... with that stare, Craig has the cruel part down, but why couldn't they have darkened his hair a bit to at least visually match the Fleming description of Bond since they did everything else so accurately ?<br /><br />In the end, as I said above Daniel Craig earns your respect with his acting ability (I was NOT originally happy to hear he won the role.... I was hoping for somebody like the dark haired actor from SIN CITY---forgot his name right now).<br /><br />But Craig does capture the personality of the \\"Fleming Novel Version of Bond\\", even if the physical appearance is slightly off.<br /><br />Sidenote: I have always seen Craig as a villian for some reason, not a good guy..... but again I repeat..... he earned my respect to the point I accept him in the role.<br /><br />I hope they keep him on a serious side though, I don't want him to start throwing out one-liner comedy in the future.<br /><br />Since I am a Bond fan for over 30+ years, I for one was happy to see the studio scrap the silly humor, the \\"Bond Formula\\" that was being used in almost everyone of the last 10+ films, and the overemphasis on special effects and stunts simply for the sale of \\"eye candy\\".<br /><br />Finally we have a more gritty, dark and dangerous spy-vs-spy world with a tough Bond and not pretty boys grinning and smiling as they toss out one-liners like they know their lives are never in any real danger.<br /><br />I think the success of \\"24\\" on Fox and The Bourne Identity taught the studios a lesson..... people want the serious spy stories again and NOT the comical romps and frolics thru over-the-top CGI-land with bad guys that look like they came out of a Marvel Comic Book.<br /><br />Bond is Back !<br /><br />I hope the general viewing public is sharp enough to know or educate themselves on some Bond/Fleming history to appeciate this film for what it is.some reason, not a good guy..... but again I repeat..... he earned my respect to the point I accept him in the role. <br />I hope they keep him on a serious side though, I don't want him to start throwing out one-liner comedy in the future. <br /> <br />Since I am a Bond fan for over 30+ years, I for one was happy to see the studio scrap the silly humor, the \\"Bond Formula\\" that was being used in almost everyone of the last 10+ films, and the overemphasis on special effects and stunts simply for the sale of \\"eye candy\\". <br /> <br />Finally we have a more gritty, dark and dangerous spy-vs-spy world with a tough Bond and not pretty boys grinning and smiling as they toss out one-liners like they know their lives are never in any real danger. <br /> <br />I think the success of \\"24\\" on Fox and The Bourne Identity taught the studios a lesson..... people want the serious spy stories again and NOT the comical romps and frolics thru over-the-top CGI-land with bad guys that look like they came out of a Marvel Comic Book. <br /> <br />Bond is Back ! <br /> <br />I hope the general viewing public is sharp enough to know or educate themselves on some Bond/Fleming history to appeciate this film for what it is. <br />
0517548232|3.0|This book is a nice introduction to libertarian economic philosophy. Libertarian economics is quite sensible stuff, though there are a couple of interesting ansatzes that are quite false.<br /><br />The main bad idea is that the market is rational. A free market does not choose the best price via the laws of supply and demand. While supply and demand factor in, cartels, monopolies, advertising, irrational exuberance, war, quasi-religious crazes (c.f. cabbage patch dolls or whatever kids toy people go wild for now a days) all factor into prices. This isn't idle theorizing on my part: I make my living on this fact.<br /><br />Another falsehood is that governmentally funded projects are somehow inherently evil. The author goes to great lengths to \\"prove\\" this. I find it absurd (though, to be fair, I have worked for a governmentally funded project). Virtually all scientific and technological progress since the 1940s has been the result of a  governmentally funded project. Most infrastructure since the 1930s; dams, bridges, highways has been a result of same. I can't argue much with his assertion that various ham-handed governmental interferences with the economy (price-fixing, industry bail-outs, etc) are silly and rarely work. Those have generally been disasters.  But, for example, microchips and the internet seem to be pretty useful. Perhaps it wasn't as easy to see this in Hazlitt's era. Certainly some people still make this argument.
B000A2H812|5.0|Take Clash/Sex Pistols punk-hard-rock energy, add a blend of crazy, slippery east european and latin rhythms, and gypsy instrumental virtuosity.  Throw in a shovelful of amphetamines and enough vodka to make the whole thing flammable, then stand back and throw a match.  Voila.  Gogol Bordello.  Probably no other band that's walked the earth, has ever been quite this frenetic, ferocious, or fun.  This is music with angry eyes and a goofy grin.
1594200823|3.0|The authors original intent when writing this book was to chronicle the process of food, from corn to animal to people but because he couldn't get access to the big industrial corn and meat processing plants, the book mutates into an examination of organic farming as an alternative. So the first few chapters are really insightful and then basically its like \\"well the big meat processing companies ain't going to give me any material to write with, so I guess I'll have to be creative and fill this book somehow.\\" And that how is by writing about organic farming, but not in the third person sense where there's facts and figures and insight, rather its the first person sense where there's story, \\"this is what I did here and this is what I did there\\" Much less concise so you can really fill pages with words and pad out a book with. If you're a reader interested in the message more so than in a story then I suggest simply reading the reviews people have posted and save yourself some money, because the author actually devotes five chapters to how he went into the woods to forage and hunt for his own food.
B000IU3Y1O|4.0|Since Amazon does not present the tracklisting of the DVD (and only the CD), here it is:<br /><br />-DVD-<br />01 Just Can't Get Enough<br />02 Everything Counts<br />03 People Are People<br />04 Master And Servant<br />05 Shake The Disease<br />06 Stripped<br />07 A Question Of Time<br />08 Strangelove<br />09 Never Let Me Down Again<br />10 Behind The Wheel<br />11 Personal Jesus<br />12 Enjoy The Silence<br />13 I Feel You<br />14 Walking In My Shoes<br />15 In Your Room<br />16 Barrel Of A Gun<br />17 It's No Good<br />18 Only When I Lose Myself<br />19 Dream On<br />20 I Feel Loved<br />21 Enjoy The Silence '04<br />22 Precious<br />23 Suffer Well<br /><br />Plus - The Best Of Depeche Mode [A Short Film]<br /><br />So, are we really in need of another Depeche Mode compilation?  We have the recent 'The Singles 81-85' and 'The Singles 86-98' releases from 1998 and 1999.  So why invest in another DM compilation?<br /><br />First, these tracks have been remastered by Simon Heyworth @ Super Audio Mastering, Devon.  However, I must note that the remastering here on this 'Best Of' release is not as good as the remastering on the 'The Singles' releases.  In fact, it's disappointing, namely on the earlier cuts.  The difference is that 'The Singles' releases were remastered by Mike Marsh @ the Exchange.  The mastering on those CDs is much more punchy and full, whereas the mastering here seems more restrained and flat.<br /><br />I would have preferred Marsh's work on this release!  I never understood the hype over Heyworth's mastering because it often ends up sounding flat and close to the original in many cases (i.e. The Human League and OMD), whereas other mastering engineers are able to bring out more depth in the music.  That's not to say that I haven't heard some good mastering come from Heyworth.  It just isn't here, unfortunately.<br /><br />For example, do an A/B comparison between \\"Personal Jesus\\" on this 'Best Of' with the same track on 'The Singles 81-85'. The difference is obvious.  It's flat on this 'Best Of' and punchy on the 'The Singles' release.  The latter era tracks are recent so the mastering differences really can't be heard.  Nonetheless, you will be grabbing for your 'The Singles' releases if you are picky about sound quality.  I do, anyway.<br /><br />Second, we have the fantastic new single, \\"Martyr\\", included here. Originally recorded for the 'Playing The Angel' album, it didn't really fit with the style of the album and finds a welcomed place here as the single to promote the release. It's a classic DM recording. Check out that U-Myx as well!<br /><br />Next, and perhaps best of all, 'The Best Of Depeche Mode, Vol. 1' comes with a DVD on certain pressings -- the pink coloured rose pressing has the DVD. This DVD includes 23 promo music videos, some previously available on the DVD 'The Singles 86-98' and some previously unreleased.  All music videos are presented with the Heyworth remastered audio and crisp picture.  The earlier videos presented here have never looked and sounded better with the remastered audio re-synced as the soundtrack.  This is a bonus since some record labels use the original underlying audio track.<br /><br />Furthermore, an excellent 30-minute documentary is included, highlighting a number of the singles and videos here in chronological order, from 1981's \\"New Life\\" to 2006's \\"Martyr\\".  This is an excellent documentary, which I enjoy watching often.<br /><br />So what's missing?  On the CD, we are missing a bunch of hits, considering the release is limited to 18 tracks.  Notably missing from the CD are classics such as \\"Behind The Wheel\\", \\"Policy Of Truth\\", and \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\", to name a few.  The DVD, featuring 5 more tracks than the CD, includes a handful of videos to tracks not presented on the CD.<br /><br />Music fans have to remember that the title is listed as \\"Volume 1\\", more than likely making room for a second installment.  I can only imagine that these missing hits will be included on this second volume.  My main problem with the DVD is that it's missing videos for a few tracks featured on the CD side.  Where are the videos for \\"See You\\" and \\"New Life\\"?  It's a bit odd watching the documentary, which features a highlight of the \\"See You\\" video and single, and not have the whole video included in the package.  \\"Martyr\\" is excusable since it's the new single for the package.  However, all the other 15 songs on the CD are featured in video format on the DVD.<br /><br />So will these videos finally make a complete collection with another set of videos for volume 2?  My understanding is that Depeche Mode do not like a certain selection of videos from their catalogue and therefore will never release them on DVD.  Such a shame really!<br /><br />In addition to the excellent companion DVD, the release is presented with nice artwork and informative liner notes.  I really like the cover!  The DVD is the real treat here, since it features a handful of previously unreleased videos.  It's a very enjoyable package overall, despite the flaws, so I'm giving it a generous 4 stars.  I'm looking forward to volume 2!re are the videos for \\"See You\\" and \\"New Life\\"?

B00005K9LM|4.0|After the massive success of the 'Screaming' album and tour, Priest went back to the studio to create what would eventually be a 'Screming' redux. 'Defenders of the Faith' released in January 1984, was my first Judas Priest record and for that reason alone it holds a special place in my heart. But after twenty-two years does it hold up? 'Defenders' is as loud a commercial metal album as you'll find from this time period, but it comes at a time in Priest's career when they had said all they could say and were far from the metal innovators of the previous decade. 'Screaming' had laid the template and 'Defenders' sticks to the formula although as many reviewers have said, there are no obvious hits. Openning track \\"Freewheel Burning\\" is one of the few great speed metal tracks that Priest were putting out by this point, with Halford and Tipton both at the top of their games from a performance standpoint. Other soild tracks include \\"Jawbreaker\\", \\"The Sentinel\\", \\"Rock Hard Ride Free\\" and maybe \\"Another Thing Comin\\" sound alike \\"Heads Are Gonna Roll\\". \\"Love Bites\\" is OK, not great, and \\"Eat Me Alive\\" is hilariously stupid. Is it just me or do the songs descend in quality as you go deeper into the album? \\"Night Comes Down\\"? Why?? \\"Heavy Duty\\"???? Dumbest song of all time!!!! Judas Priest were now pandering to the lowest common denominator of metal fans (hello \\"Heavy Metal Parking Lot\\"!). The 2001 remaster brings out the loudness of the original but also includes yet another awful song from the \\"Turd-bo\\" sessions and an, \\"Oh you've got to be kidding me\\" version of aforementioned dumbest song ever! What, no great smoking version of \\"Freewheel\\"? Terrible! While Metallica and Mercyful Fate were proving metal was still the best and most dangerous music on earth in 1984, Priest was going through the motions. Buy it for the sheer loudness quality and for four or five solid metal tunes, but ignore the mediocrity of the songwriting quality over all, especailly from \\"Love Bites\\" on.
0897500482|5.0|Be Like Water? March 17, 2004<br /><br />Bruce Lee, got his foundation in Wing Chun Kung Fu. When you read this book, don't misunderstand Bruce Lee's philosophy: he is offering you concepts. The concept of throwing out everything in an art that you can't use and adding what you think is useful often leaves a watered down version each succeeding generation of new students depending upon what their teachers think useless. Some- how I don't think that was Bruce Lee's intention or meaning! The individual can however, develop his or her own repitoire by training in more than just one style, which was considered disloyal, when Bruce Lee was alive. Bruce Lee, wasn't about style he was about concepts, but don't forget he already got his foundation from Wing Chun, so pick an art to stay with and develop your foundation as you grow in the martial arts. Buy this and read it several times.<br /><br />Train hard and have fun!<br /><br />Guro Dennis Servaes
B000HEZF0E|4.0|I am not going to bore people with what the plots on these 3 movies are about as I think we all have a reasonable grasp of them. What I will say about the HD-DVD boxset is that MI2 and MI3 are both spectacular examples of this high definition format. They excel in both the video and audio transfers, I think they would have been par excellence if they had of included a TrueHD audio track.<br /><br />The one down point to this set is the original MI HD-DVD, the ball was dropped on this one with a sub par video transfer which at times was so out of focus that it was not funny. The audio, while not jaw dropping, was acceptable.
B000I0QK74|5.0|I have the Hallmark rendition of this CD, and I must say that it is my favorite Christmas CD.  If my family would let me, I'd listen to it year round.  I've always been a JT fan, and this just frosts the cake for me.  Don't miss it! It's yummy. <br />
1597371424|5.0|I borrowed this set of CDs from the library for something to listen to while I walked.  I fell completely in love.  I had to buy it for myself.  I already knew the story, having read it a few times myself, but hearing it read on this set, it was so much more beautiful.  Ms. Williams voice is lovely, I love the way she speaks as Lady Catherine, and her voice for Lydia.  Both hilarious but real, exactly as I would expect them to sound were I there.<br /><br />This is one of my very favorite stories ever, and Ms. Williams made it that much more wonderful for me.  I recommend this product to everyone in the world.
B0000BWTK3|5.0|I must admit I was sceptical at first when I heard that Andsnes was releasing this new CD of the Grieg and Schumann concertos. As much as I feared that this might be a run-of-the-mill performance, I found I was very well pleased with the result. Although I own the Lupu CD of these kindred souls of piano concertos (and found them perfectly balanced), I soon found that this Andsnes version runs rings around all the other versions I have heard so far. No matter what other people say, Andsnes is a superb pianist who gives well-rounded and balanced accounts of these two concertos, backed by punchy accompaniment from Jansons and the Berliners, and a sumptuous EMI recording that lacks a little in detail and clarity.    The Grieg concerto starts out with a punchy first movement, energetic and poetic, as if Andsnes and Jansons are setting sparks off at each other. Andsnes' opening flourish is firm and weighty, but he counterbalances it with a due sense of poetry in the quieter sections of the movement. The slow movement is meditative but it never drags the concerto, and Andsnes, true to his Norweigan roots, really relishes the dance-like finale. In the secondary theme of the finale he is given excellent support by the winds, especially the flautist, in evoking the Norweigan fjords that might have inspired this music. The Schumann is a beautifully renderred version, and Andsnes taps more into his poetic gifts here. One hears a continuous forward momentum in this work that I tend to find sorely lacking in other recordings. Andsnes conveys a strength and a vulnerability crucial in this piece, and the first movement really stands out. The Intermezzo ably bridges the first movement and the finale, and one can hear a joie de vivre here.    In short, I would recommend this disc to every lover of classical music and especially piano music, no matter how many other versions of these concertos you have. I think that even though I disagree with most music critics, this was well-deserving of the Rosette and the Gramophone Editor's Choice that it garnered.
1401307450|5.0|Wow, what a read! I couldn't put this book down once I started reading it. Anthony Kiedis sure has lived a life, having experienced the highest of highs and lowest of lows. He is very open in this biography, detailing his life from a toddler right up until the band were ready to tour the By the Way album. He tells all on his relationship with girls, his parents and sister. Friends his made over the years and friends he's lost. And is very specific on his tragic addiction to drugs over the years, from an early age. I never knew he had such problems with heroin.<br /><br />This is a very addictive read, very informative and interesting, the life as lead singer and songwriter for the Red Hot Chili Peppers has sure had a rollercoaster ride of a life. My flatmate who knew nothing about the band and wasn't even a fan found this a very interesting book and thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Any fan will definitely love it.<br /><br />You think you know all there is to know about the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Anthony Kiedes?...Wll you don't know anything til you have read this book. Includes lots of pics as well within its 465 pages.
B00005OAIE|4.0|First off i'd like to say that i agree with the person who asked who Rickey Wright was. Does this guy know anything about music? Anyway, i am also guilty of reviewing this album 5 years later, but the fact is John Mayer's music is like nothing that is out today. After falling in love with \\"Continuum\\", i felt compelled to get \\"Room For Squares\\" and \\"Heavier Things.\\" Both albums are filled with great lirycs, smooth melodies, great beats and sounds. Each album has its own classic tunes. If you haven't discovered Johm Mayer, pick up \\"Continuum\\" and you will!  This dude is gonna be around for decades to come..deal with it Rickey Wright!
B00006LLOG|4.0|This has always been my favorite Lou Reed album.<br /><br />I am a big fan however, to be a fan is to also realize that Lou Reed can be pretentious and self indulgent, he's a real hit and miss artist and he goes into phases. These so-called detriments also make him great...he's a true artist that takes chances and does not try to appease the commerciality of his work. This album achieves the perfect balance between experimental, listenable and commercial.<br /><br />There is an incredible variety of different songs and sounds here;<br /><br />\\"Vicious\\" is a great rave up with the dirtiest, raunchiest, nastiest and most fuzzed out guitar tone that I have ever heard. It's a great song with lyrics that perfectly fit the title of the song.<br /><br />\\"Andy's Chest\\" is a this wonderfully odd, perverted and surrealistic ballad.<br /><br />The clasic \\"Walk on the Willd Side\\" is a tale of what it was like to hang out and observe the characters that come in and out of Andy Warhol's world. The song sounds pretty simply but, for its time, it was innovative in its use of featuring a fretless bass. From a musical perspective, this is a cool song.<br /><br />\\"Perfect Day\\" in my opinion, is the best song on the album. It is gorgeous and conveys a nice sense of optimism.<br /><br />\\"Hanging Around\\" is a conventional rock song.<br /><br />\\"Make Up\\" is a weird, ode to gay-ness anmd transvestism. How many songs utilize the tuba as the featured instrument?<br /><br />\\"Satellite of Love\\" is a leftover Velvet Underground tune and is another beautiful melody.<br /><br />Most Lou Reed albums have flashes of brilliance but there are also unlistenable ones as well. This album, from start to finsh, is great. It has a certain bohemian theme which links all the songs.<br /><br />A greatest hits compilation is difficult with this artist since his different phases created a very wide variety of songs and sounds. \\"Transformer\\" was probably the start of Lou's glam period. He  had a lot of confidence in his work and plenty of critical attention was placed upon him.<br /><br />This is the best introductory Lou Reed work.st introductory Lou Reed work.
B0000032LS|4.0|This movie is a classic and love by most people that I've come in contact with.  It was great to be able to find the orginal soundtrack with the orginal cast. To be able to sing along in car with the CD is great.<br /><br />Loved it!!
B00000IMTE|1.0|This is garbage! Ritchie Blackmore took himself way too seriously. He left Deep Purple for this? Grown men singing about fairies, kings, dragons and the middleages? For, like, all the songs?<br /><br />\\"Man on the Silver Mountain\\" is a great, classic song (it is also acts as a bait switch...great first song and then all down hill from there). The instrumental at the end is enjoyable since it showcases Blackmore's guitar playing (which is the reason why most people checked this out).<br /><br />This sounds so silly and dated today. Ronnie James Dio's voice was a bad match for this muscular sound.<br /><br />Sorry metal fans, this stinks!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Stripped, Christina's 2nd album of new material, is her best one to date.  It is even better than this years Back To Basics.  Every Single song is about something effecting and relatable, unlike her other albums.  The song themes range from abusive parents, to abusive relationships, to self esteem issues, to sexual expression, to pro feminism.  In stead of taking a bubble gum approach like her first album, or taking a 'I love my man' theme like her newest album, she bares her soul to the listener and seems genuinely angry by how the world around her works.  She comes off as a strong, intelligent, outspoken women in this album.  This is the only time in Christina's history that I was actually able to respect her as a person and art maker.  I hope that this whole crowd pleasing phase she is going through will end soon and she will get back to doing what truly matter, expressing herself in this world of generic artists.<br /><br />The key tracks are: Can't Hold Us Down, Beautiful, Dirrty, The Voice Within, Fighter, Walk Away, and Make Over.
B00005R24K|5.0|I can't believe it took me so long before I was ever introduced to this film.  This is truly a classic and one of my all time favorite horror movies.  As soon as my friend lended it to me & I viewed it, I was afraid to go down the basement!  I ordered my copy the next day.  Remember, this film was made for drive-ins years ago when video tape didn't exist so it must be appreciated as an early work of art that is timeless and horrific!
B000I5X824|2.0|Perhaps I've been too hard on these schmo's for too long.  Could they really have been as brain atrophying as I remember, with Aaron Lewis's monotonous drone spewing Emo-disguised-as-metal dirges for his ever-dwindling fan base? Could my abhorrence been manifested through my utter disgust with Rock `N' Roll lately, the nucleus that created the boy-to man all those years ago?  Well, sort of; I mean I've always reviled despondent frat boys milking misery all the way to Fort Knox; say nothing of the execrable Fred Durst connection.  But my main gripe has always been their formulaic preconceived propensity - with nary an original musical refrain in their whole catalogue.  But despite that, within the moribund, dank, chain-filled, leaking caverns of Lewis' clich&eacute;d soul lay a man in need of therapy. And sometimes a tortured despondent makes for interesting listening.  Sometimes.  With a wife and family to raise, the incessant need for the continuous shades of grey seems hypocritical at best, a cry for help at worst.  Not to mention formulaic.  My grade:  B-
0671027344|5.0|This is basically my favorite book.  It's not fancy high literature but rather a moving story about being an quasi-outsider and growing up, with a great happy/sad plot and some very witty lines.  I read this when I, like Charlie, was a freshman in high school, and the voice of the novel is so authentic that I really believed in these characters.  I could go on about how much I love this book, but other people have already talked about it, and the main point is that anyone who remembers being a teenager somewhere (Perks is unoffically set in the Pittsburgh suburbs based on my research) in the US should appreciate Perks.  By the way, don't judge your opinion solely on the reviews, check it out for yourself- Publisher's Weekly's review doesn't even get Charlie's grade right.  Years after the first time I read it, I still flip to the letters from certain dates (read about Thanksgiving on Thanksgiving, for example) and have a Perks-style Secret Santa with my roommates.  The Perks of Being A Wallflower is the quintessential high school book, and I've recommended it to my friends, who also love it.
B000I5X80G|5.0|Let me start by saying that Neil Young owes me nothing.I consider myself a true fan because I`m willing to take the good with the bad and it has made for some serious head scratching at times but now we have the first installment from the archives with songs from the imfamous Fillmore East shows from 1970.6 songs and 47 or so minutes later I still can`t understand why he never released this before now.  Each song is played with an abandon and glee that underscores just how good the original Horse was - Danny Whitten,Ralph Molina and Billy Talbot are Crazy Horse...remnants of the L.A band the Rockets and they were the ultimate garage band and for Neils` music and the direction he was heading,they were the perfect choice.  For this particular tour Neil added Jack Nitzsche on electric piano giving all the material just the right shades of color and helped round out the bands admittedly rough edges.Danny was instrumental in pushing Neil beyond his capabilities with his sympathetic guitar playing and outstanding vocals....remember that these guys started out as a vocal group before they even knew how to play their intstruments.  Definitive versions of Down By the River and a vicious reading of Cowgirl in the Sand are the conerstones of the disc,Winterlong,Wonderin,Everybody Knows and then there is Dannys` Come on Baby Lets Go Downtown - a song about heroin - round out the disc.  Incredible music and an essential artifact from a band that is no more,Neil Young has once again proved that in order to stay in the game you have to hold back and in this case I guess he was right.Rock and Roll never sounded better.
B000FQJAIW|2.0|The movie on the second disc is billed as the original theatrical release. This is only partly true. It was shown in 1977, but this was after it was cut to a commercial length. I am not a die hard purist, so don't get this wrong. However, the movie I loved was the one that existed prior to the commercial cut late in 1977. The moments with the character \\"Biggs\\" is an important part of the story, now lost. It supports Lukes longing to leave, but it also shows his longing for someone to look up to. Without these scenes this simply isn't the movie I loved-the initial release of Star Wars before it was cut to commercial length. I guess George Lucas just doesn't care about those of us who cherished the first release, which sadly now no longer exists for those who desire to see it. Shame on you Mr. Lucas!!  <br /> <br />Moral: Don't waste your money!
B000IZJ1KC|5.0|when you could be listening to this album. Abbath and Armegedda from Immortal, King from Gorgoroth, and Ice Dale from Enslaved. Do you really need any more explanation. This is a cross between Motorhead/Immortal/Bathory , this is killer mid paced songs of Ice, Battle , and Freezen cold worlds. This is killer stuff, lots of strong as hell riffs all played at midpaced levels with lots of groove. The leads are melodic and cathcy, and the solos arent over the type and everything fits the songs well. BUY THIS. Demonaz of Immortal wrote all the lyrics. I guess you could call this Bathory worship at its BEST. Def. a top 10 album of the year along with Mercenary Hours THat Remain, The Haunted Dead Eye, Hammerfall Threshold, Dream Evil United, Wolf Black Flame, and Amon AMarth With ODen On Our Side.

1400097029|3.0|John Banville finally won the Man Booker prize in 2005 with this beautifully crafted and brief novel (nearly a novella) about the pleasures and sorrows associated with the play of language, memory and secrecy. Although Banville is often considered a literary descendant of Nabokov, with his love of rich mellifluous language and obscure diction, he might be more comfrotably compared to other great Irish writers such as James Joyce and Elizabeth Bowen, who also share Banville's evident pleasure at (and grace with) the pliancy and luxury of words. THE SEA might be an expected, yet disappointing choice for winning Banville the Booker, given that its plot so closely apes the structure of one of the most crowdpleasing of all narrative arcs of highbrow fiction from the last forty years. Here yet again, a disappointed elderly narrator looks back to the magical encounter in childhood that forever fired the imagination but also implicated him (or her) in guilt when it led inevitably to a terrible and deadly error. Banville's is an odder variant of this formula -- which goes at least as far back as L. P. Hartley's THE GO-BETWEEN, and was recently repeated in Ian McEwan's much loved ATONEMENT -- in the fundamental dislikeability of all his major characters, a Banville trademark. This causes the stakes of the life-changing incident, and its effect upon the narrator, to seem much less  shattering than in Hartley's or McEwan's novels; the repetition of the formula also makes this novel seem much less fresh than in Banville's other works (which often are similarly concerned with the encounters between cruelty and innocence). But Banville is always worth reading if only for his grace with language and with narrative construction: THE SEA is, as usual, beautifully crafted in every formal sense.
B00005JPCD|2.0|It's not unwatchable, but unfortunately this beautifully animated and well-voice-acted retelling of the [[ASIN:B000R7G6KE Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]] story (obvious oddity results in ridicule and ostracism until it Saves the Day) [[ASIN:B00005JPCF Happy Feet]] is severely marred by the most in-your-face anti-Christian bigotry I've ever seen in an American children's movie and the most heavy-handed political indoctrination one is likely to encounter outside of a Soviet-style reeducation camp... or an American public school.<br /><br />Into the world of Emperor Penguins, who, according to this movie anyway, find their soul mates through song, is born a penguin who cannot sing, but he can tap dance something fierce.  So naturally his parents are ashamed, his peers are cruel, and his societal elders disapprove.  So poor Rudolph, uh, that is poor Mumble sets out on a dangerous journey in which he encounters other assorted oddballs and discovers that the oddity others have condemned is the talent required to Save the Day.<br /><br />Sounds pretty innocuous if not particularly original, doesn't it?  Well, the first problem is that in what can only be considered a deliberate (and utterly gratuitous) dig, the Emperor Penguin societal elders are portrayed as deeply religious in a way obviously patterned after Christian Fundamentalism; in other words they are portrayed rather broadly as a bunch of dangerous loons.<br /><br />Hardee-har-har.<br /><br />Second, the penguins are suffering from a food shortage caused by, you guessed it, EVIL mankind, so of course it falls to Mumble to somehow find a way to communicate the penguins' plight to Man, which of course he eventually does.  In fact this totally unrealistic ending is part of my problem with the film.  No, I don't mean the idea of intelligent penguins finding some way to communicate with us.  That is MUCH more believable than the jaw-dropper of having the United Nations in this day and age actually DO something about a world problem, if you call putting up a \\"no fishing\\" sign around Antarctica to be enforced by nothing apparently \\"doing something\\".  And I don't suppose it ever occurred to the filmmakers that their film is essentially advocating ending a penguin famine by replacing it with a HUMAN famine.  On second thought it probably did, but since the people most likely to starve as a result are dark-skinned people living on another continent, who cares?<br /><br />If they'd left out the Christian-bashing, I might have been a lot more tolerant of the (for these days) relatively mild environmental wacko message.  However, I DO think that any time you propose that Man stop eating something, especially very large amounts of something, you should be required to deal with the consequences in your story.  If you think a little mass starvation would be a GOOD thing for Mankind (\\"thin out the herd\\"), you should have the courage to admit it.  If on the other hand you simply haven't bothered to think things out that far, maybe you SHOULD... before you start preaching... to a bunch of children.<br /><br />Note: it has since been pointed out to me that the environmental wackos responsible for this movie got a MAJOR plot point completely wrong.  Remember the nearly indestructible ring carrier that Lovelace (Robin Williams) gets stuck around his neck?  It is no longer possible.  Since the late 1980's, advances in plastics technology have made them COMPLETELY photodegradable -- in other words when exposed to sun, wind, and rain, they fall apart, even when floating in water.  Now I don't write this in order to provide you with an excuse for littering (They can actually recycle these things into NEW photodegradable plastic products!), but rather as a warning for convenience store owners and employees about the dangers of displaying piles of sixpacks outside -- you will very quickly end up with a bunch of loose cans.ing up a \\"no fishing\\" sign around Antarctica to be enforced by nothing apparently \\"doing something\\".

B000IOM0YM|5.0|This collection of old classic KISS live and TV performances captures the essence of what was KISS, as one of the most INFLUENTIAL and ENTERTAINING hard rock bands EVER!  Even though lots of the video is certainly not up to today's standards as far as quality goes, it is nonetheless beyond awesome to watch KISS in action as a younger, hungry hard rock glam band striving for success and notoriety by playing their hearts out and giving 110%!  KISS had some of the absolute catchiest hard rock songs and riffing that inspired countless of young budding musicians to sing or pick up an instrument and express themselves.  The old footage of their early years presented here is a veritable goldmine of classic memories and emotions for the longtime KISS fan!  I should know, as I was at the February 1977 show at Madison Square Garden (bonus DVD included). Moreover, their music stands the test of time.  A MUST buy!
B00005JPCA|5.0|With its death defying leaps, amazing stunts, and action-packed action, I deemed Casino Royale one of the best James Bond movies ever. Add Judi Dench as M and a few Bond girls like Ivana Milicevic as Valenka, Eva Green as Vesper Lynd, and some typical Bond bad guys like Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre and here is a Bond classic. Daniel Craig came across brilliantly and then some, and he was handsome. He was more like Sean Connery than the last Bonds but more high-tech which makes the movie awesome. With all the hype about Mister Craig taking over as 007, I had my doubts that he would fit the bill. But then, he appeared on screen and almost immediately I thought: \\"Here is the new 007.\\"<br />  He has Sean Sean Connery's blessing, and he has mine too. Being a die-hard Bond fan, I can't wait to see Mister Craig in the next Bond film.<br /><br />  This review pertains to the theatrical cut, which kept me at the edge of my seat. What a thrill-ride, to say the least. I give this movie 1,000,000 STARS for being a great film. But, mind you, it's not for the kiddies, only 13+
0739339788|5.0|For a while I resisted reading this book, thinking that it could not possibly be as good as its hype. Well, I was wrong. This is simply one terrific book that will keep the reader riveted to its pages until the very last one is turned. It is a very well-written, intricately plotted thriller in which a great number of esoteric historical facts and interesting theories of a religious nature are woven. Those who read it should, first and foremost, keep in mind that this book is simply a work of fiction.<br /><br />All hell breaks loose when Jacques Sauniere, the elderly and revered curator of the Louvre, is murdered inside the museum. The crime scene and the body itself are laden with symbols and cryptic messages pointing to renowned Harvard symbologist, Robert Langdon. He is invited to the crime scene by the wily Captain Bezu Fache, of the Central Directorate Judicial Police, the French equivalent of our Federal Bureau of Investigation, ostensibly to assist the police. Little does Langdon know that he is, in fact, the prime suspect.<br /><br />When he meets police cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, they join forces. They are then led on a merry chase by a series of riddles and ciphers that are ground in a historical context. They are always just one step of the French police, who seem determined to charge Langdon with the murder of Jacques Sauniere. During their voyage of discovery, Langdon and Sophie come across a secret society, the Priory of Sion, that has a startling list of former members, which list includes Leonardo Da Vinci, as well as the late Jacques Sauniere. There is also some interesting historical detail about the ancient Knights Templar, as well as Opus Dei, a conservative religious organization currently in existence.<br /><br />Langdon and Sophie peel back layers of historical clues that point to a secret of such magnitude that some would kill for it. As Langdon and Sophie surreptitiously travel from France to England and seem to be headed closer to the heart of the mystery that they are trying to unravel, an unknown nemesis is closer to them than they would dare imagine. This unknown adversary is marshaling resources in order to obtain the long hidden secret that Langdon and Sophie appear to be on the brink of discovering. It is one that has the potential to have earth shattering implications.<br /><br />This is a fast-paced, plot driven, rather than character driven, thriller. It hurls itself into the reader's consciousness at break-neck speed, and before the reader realizes it, the book holds the reader in its thrall: hook, line, and sinker. For those readers who love historical detail and unusual facts and coincidences, this is definitely a fascinating book that will hold their interest. It is a page-turning thriller in which nearly every chapter leaves the reader on the brink of a precipice. The book is written in clear, effortless prose, which makes the most esoteric historical details surprisingly easy to understand. Simple in its presentation but intricate in its plotting, it is no surprise that this book has become a runaway, international bestseller.

B00005JLH3|5.0|I saw Drumline at the theatre and I'm still wearing out the DVD!  It is an entertaining look at a part of black culture rarely seen in film or television, black college marching bands.  The main character is Devon Miles (Nick Cannon), a snare drummer from New York City attending fictional Atlanta A&T on a band scholarship.  Devon is extremely talented but his cocky arrogant attitude and defiance to authority immediately causes conflict with his prideful section leader Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts) and straitlaced band director Dr. James Lee (Orlando Jones).  On top of that, it's later revealed that he can't read music and that he lied on his application about it.      Dr Lee reluctantly puts up with Devon and his bad attitude because his job is on the line due to his insistence on playing old school music only (playing \\"Flight Of The Bumblebee\\" while his own band is jamming to the opposition's music) until Devon goes too far.  Devon later realizes that no matter how talented he is, he can never be bigger than the band.  Sean gets over his jealousy for the good of the band and helps Devon earn his way back into favor with Dr Lee and Dr Lee himself relaxes his standards without compromising himself.  Along the way, Devon forges a relationship with a beautiful drill team member (Zoe Saldana).  Seen it all before?  Some may have, some may not have but never like this!  It's a thrill ride from the first day of training all the way to the big showdown near the end!  Credit should also be given to the Morris Brown Marching Wolverines, a very respected band in real-life, for allowing themselves to be portrayed as the antagonists (not to mention having the guts to have J. Anthony Brown portray their band director).    Don't listen to the overly technical critics of this film.  They really need to lighten up and get a life.  I hardly think that anyone really cares about the tips of Nick Cannon's drumsticks among the other nitpicky things people have commented on.  Drumline'smain purpose was to entertain and to give further exposure to an unexplored part of black culture and I hardly think a better job could have been done doing it!  Try watching the DVD with the commentary to learn even more.  Either way you watch it, you will not be disappointed!
B000KFTWIG|5.0|Biggie drops it hard and releases a Classic rap album here for his debut. A good amount of these were killing the radio in 94 and 95 (and still in 05). After this he became crowned the King of the East, the east came back toward the top and the East/West hyped from the media feud, and thus his feud with old homie 2Pac \\"King of the West\\" began and lead to the death of them both.

B00005JPCA|5.0|No joke people, this may be the best 007 flick ever made. Daniel Craig crushes all doubts about his acting with a knockout performance as James Bond. He delivers the lines perfectly and has the muscles to get in some brutal fights with his enemies. Could any other Bond actor pull off these physical scenes? I think not. I love Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan in the role, but Daniel Craig now ranks second in my book, right after Connery. Give him a couple more films and he could be move up to that first spot. Now the movie itself was also much smarter than any recent 007 movie. The dialogue was fresh and lacked the cheese of the last few Bond films. The acting was very good, especially the equally smart Bond girl played by Eva Green. It was also nice to see the usage of practical effects rather than the horrible CGI that plagued Die Another Day.<br /><br />The only minor complaint was that they didn't use the famous Bond theme until the end credits began to roll. I love that music!<br /><br />Like Batman Begins, Casino Royale has restarted the series and taken it into a new, yet positive direction. Daniel Craig is here to stay folks, and Casino Royale can be mentioned in the same sentence as Goldfinger and inspire no laughter.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|By far MCR's best work yet.  Each song is a story in it's own, covering huge emotional ranges, and causing you to constantly press the back button.  Honestly worth every penny and more.
B00005JPAJ|3.0|\\"Babel\\" is a series of four related stories. The first is about a well intentioned Latina nanny, Amelia (Adraina Barraza), who takes the two San Diego kids she cares for to a wedding in Mexico. Unfortunately, her drunk and irresponsible nephew, Santiago, gets involved in a police chase while trying to cross the border and ends up abandoning Amelia and the kids in the desert. Meanwhile, the children's parents, Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett), are on vacation in Morroco. But their trip gets cut short when two young Moroccan shephards accidently shoot Susan while goofing around with a gun. The owner of this gun had originally been a Japanese businessman who has a deaf daughter, Chieko (Rinko Kikiuchi), who is intensely distraught following her mother's recent suicide. Chieko seeks to deal with her emotional neediness by seeking out casual sex. But is only laughed out and rejected because of her disability. Of course, this causes her to become even more insecure and desperate.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the stories are brought together in a way that seems forced and highly improbable. The Japanese story was the best and I would have preferred to see the director make a feature length film of this rather than try to interconnect the four separate plots. The title \\"Babel\\" obviously alludes to the biblical story and the movie seems to be trying to make some grandiose statement about the difficulty of communication in a world that is rapidly facing globalization while still speaking different languages and holding different cultural and religious values. Unfortunately, this point is made in a way that seems all too obvious and heavy handed rather than suggesting anything uniquely insightful. Futhermore, the stories are written with pretense and without humor, subtlety or even a sense of hope.   <br /> <br /> <br />Several years ago Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu directed an outstanding movie called \\"Amores Perros\\" about three sets of characters living in Mexico City. Each individual story was powerfully realistic and yet was interconnected to the others in a way that was almost magically sychronistic. \\"Amores Perros,\\" full of both hope and tragedy, was a great film and heralded Gonzalez Inarritu as a major new figure in the emerging world of Mexican cinema. <br /> <br />With \\"Babel\\" Gonzalez Inarritu shows he is still attempting to make artistically important films but has somehow lost his way. At the time, \\"Amores Perros\\" seemd original and unique with it's use of interlinked stories. But in \\"Babel\\" this method no longer seems  innovative. But rather just a formulaic attempt by the director to duplicate his earlier success. Truly great filmmakers are always striving for originality and new styles of expression. But, after \\"Babel\\" and the also disappointing \\"21 Grams,\\" Gonzalez Inarritu is starting to seem like a \\"one trick pony\\" with nothing new to offer.
B000HTL8EQ|5.0|What would you do, if a mysterious plague swept throughout the world, literally killing everyone off, but leaving in its place something new, something frightening, something downright horrible, while leaving you alive, immune and seemingly alone? What would you do, if the undead now walked the earth looking for you, the last man alive...the last vestige of the human race? What if what they wanted was the taste of your blood on their lips? Just what on earth would you do?<br /><br />These are the questions that faced Robert Neville. It is he who is Legend. How he answers them is what makes this a book to remember and a classic within its genre. It is a book of profound hope and despair. It is a book which demands to be read. Read it. You will not be disappointed.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I have only been a My Chemical Romance fan for about 3 years now, but I love them. I was really hoping that this CD would be better than their previous Cd's, and I think it definetely did. With the guest vocals of liza minnelli (who I never thought would do this), Mama is an amazing song. Cancer, a stripped down song with only strings and light piano in the background, only leaves Gerard's vocals to make this song haunting and beautiful. All the songs are so deep, no matter how much MTV and the radio plays The Black Parade, I will still be so addicted to it. I am a huge My Chemical Romace fan now, they have made this CD amazing!!
B00005JPCA|5.0|The newest edition of the James Bond franchise is the best Bond flick in a VERY long time. The last few had practically bottomed out the legend that is James Bond. This film is precisely what was needed if there was to be any hope left in the series. There needed to be drastic changes that took the movie away from the ridiculous repetitiveness of the tired cliches' that have come to make up a Bond film. And even staple characters of the previous movies have been removed, and the film benefits for it. <br /> <br />There can only be so many Bond films where the villain monologues endlessly about impending doom, only to leave Bond to die at the hands of some nameless lackeys whom Bond beats in time to save the world and the girl. Those were Bond films of a different time. Wonderful classics that deserve praise, however, the franchise could not have continued without fresh ideas. <br /> <br />Casino Royal is the one that has broken the mold, I hope for good.
B00005JPCC|5.0|This movie stands very well on it's own, as an entertaining, intelligent, first class action movie. My wife knows very little (and cares even less) about the Bond legacy, she enjoyed the movie for the action, great acting, and beautiful settings and atmosphere. I on the under hand am a die hard Bond fan and saw all the movies, most of them more than once (except for Die another Day which which was not worth it). I enjoyed it very much for all the small details that build up the evolution of the Bond hero as we know him, including many 'future' gestures.  BTW I don't know if people already wrote about it, Bond uses here many of the killing methods that he will use (have used...) in the 'future' films, on different vilains. This is indeed one of the best Bond in many years.

B0002UOK04|5.0|Only 8 songs.  Average song length would be close to 7 minutes.  The compositions are dynamic, leading from symphonic strings and bells into some of the best speed-metal riffs in existence.  Jari uses a 6 string attack, and he sticks to normal tuning--no dropped playing here.  These songs have a very classical feel... his vocals are much better than traditional \\"death metal.\\"  He sounds closest on his growls to Dark Tranquillity.  There is all sorts of singing as well, he goes from power metal and death metal at perfect times, as someone else stated, his concept of timing on this is perfect for the passage at hand.  It's been a very difficult record for me to stop playing, but you can't listen to it on short car trips... you won't have enough time to listen to it all.  Impeccable, impressive, the best death metal I've heard and a very refreshing interpretation at that.
B000000WFU|2.0|I'm not sure how to refer to song which happens to contain the name of the band.  I'd call it the title track but that's what you call a song that shares the album title, not the band name.  Anyways, \\"Adiemus\\" is the catchiest song on here and nothing else comes close except for \\"Kayama\\" which just sounds like it's trying to copy \\"Adiemus\\".  I'm aware that this isn't really the type of music that's supposed to have catchy songs but even background music should have a sense of being able to stand alone. <br /> <br />Other songs such as \\"In Caelum Fero\\" and \\"Amate Adea\\" have great beginnings but don't go anywhere positive and that's saying something for the former seeing as how it's an 11 minute song.  The only other song that's holding this together is the ending \\"Hymn\\" which is okay but seems like more of an interlude. <br /> <br />If you're looking for New Age music, you can do better than this.
B000I5X81A|4.0|A few years ago, Clapton was quoted saying that he was the \\"closest thing an English man could come to be J.J. Cale.\\" Whether this is accurate or wishful thinking, it speaks volumes about Eric Clapton's admiration for his friend and fellow guitar slinger.<br /><br />Having scored mega-hits with Cale's \\"Cocaine\\" and \\"After Midnight,\\" Clapton has, again, something to thank J.J. for. The former \\"god\\" of classic Rock has not, in my opinion, put out a truly exciting album in many years but, though this is not a masterpiece, playing with Cale has done him a world of good.<br /><br />The overall feel here is 100% Cale, laid back grooves and restrained Blues that, before you know it'll seep slowly into your DNA and make you sway and shuffle hopelessly. Cale capacity to say very much with very few notes is legendary and this album is further proof of it. Clapton, on his part, seems to play freed from pressures to turn out another classic and he sounds more convincing and dead-on than he has in at least a decade or two.<br /><br />There are several songs that either guitar player could be proud to include in their canon. Whether you think of the sensuos \\"Hard To Thrill\\"--probably the best track here--or Cale's trademark cadences in \\"Danger,\\" or the sweet \\"Three Little Girls,\\" \\"Heads In Georgia\\" or \\"Last Will And Testament,\\" if you like these guys you are in for a treat. No surprises nor unexpected turns, nothing \\"escondido\\"--\\"hidden\\" in Spanish--either, actually. Just the album you'd guess these two would make if they ever got together, and that's a very good thing.<br /><br />All in all, this is a wonderful set of songs, played with passion but without the slightest bit of tension or need for showing off. It is an album made by two great musicians who, like any two friends, can relax in each other's presence and do what they do best: make some memorable music.

B00005JPC6|2.0|Max Skinner (Russell Crowe), a successful London stock trader, inherits the French chateau and vineyard he once shared with his uncle.  He goes there to settle affairs and sell the place and is dazzled by Fanny (Marion Cotillard), a waitress who's just as feisty as he is; then a teenager shows up claiming to be his uncle's child, and he could lose the property to her.<br /><br />The title apparently refers to the length of the movie:  It's plenty long enough to catch a nap and still not miss anything important. You know from the start that the money-loving businessman will have his life transformed by the simple joys of Provence, but it takes way too long and you just don't care.  Crowe is a good actor, but his Max isn't likeable at all; in fact, none of the characters are.  (The only cast member I liked was the bouncy little dog.)  Crowe has no chemistry with Fanny (who is too beautiful to be believed) and their relationship is pointless.  The uncle's daughter has no personality, and the winemaker and his wife are just annoying.  The movie gets two stars for the Provencal scenery and ambiance.  Not up to dirctor Ridley Scott's usual standard.
0380778556|5.0|I always think of JANE EYRE and REBECCA together as they are so very similar in plot.  Both have young, artistic, not conventionally pretty heroines who are totally alone in the world and fall madly in love with older mysterious wealthy men.  Against all odds these men fall in love with our innocent heroines.  And of course both novels feature beautiful dark women from the men's past who threaten to ruin our heroine's happiness.  The hero's are both flawed because they have been abused by these horrid first wives.  REBECCA is told in first person by our never named narrator (the heroine is NOT Rebecca) and has a mysterious quality throughout.  It is more modern and less \\"preachy\\" than JANE EYRE.  Many romantic suspense novels have tried to copy the gothic romance formula but none do it as well as Du Maurier in REBECCA or Charlotte Bronte in JANE EYRE.  All book lovers who have not yet discovered the wonderful novel REBECCA should do themselves a favor and start reading it today!

B00005JPCA|3.0|**Warning: Possible Spoilers** <br /> <br />Maybe it's because I'm so used to the portrayals of Bond by Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Pierce Brosnan, that I couldn't connect with Daniel Craig's Bond as easily.  Personally, I was expecting Bond to be a far more suave character in this movie, but Craig's Bond was a lot darker and harsh than previous Bond incarnations.  Frankly, I thought that Casino Royale was a pretty good movie, but not as good as I thought it was going to be, especially after hearing all the critical praise it was getting. <br /> <br />The plot of this movie revolves around Bond trying to stop a man named Le Chiffre, who is a member of an organization that funds terrorists worldwide.  Bond is sent to play against him in a high stakes poker game that would cause the collapse of Le Chiffre's organization should Bond win.  One thing I enjoyed about Casino Royale was that it was full of great twists and double-crosses, many of which were completely unexpected.  This is something you don't often see in a Bond movie. <br /> <br />The action scenes in this movie are definitely top notch.  My favourite scene involved Bond chasing down a man in Madagascar.  In this scene, the man that Bond was chasing moved almost as he were Spider-Man, while Bond himself was struggling to catch up, and had to come up with innovative ways to get to him.  This chase was a perfect way to emphasize the fact that he is new to the double 0 spy game.  Also, the scene where Bond tries to stop a man from blowing up an airliner in Miami may be derivative at first glance, but it was fun nonetheless. <br /> <br />So now you must be wondering why I didn't give Casino Royale a higher score.  Well, first off, the relationship between Bond and Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green) felt a little too forced, almost as if it was simply put in there to forward the plot, and not much more.  Also, the pacing in the movie was a little uneven, especially towards the end of the movie, where it lookedlike the movie was going to end at several points, but just kept on going.  Lastly, this movie just felt that it was about 20 minutes longer than it should be.  Personally, if I were the editor I would have cut out a lot of the unnecessary scenes between Bond and Lynd, as they did little to add to the overall movie. <br /> <br />As I previously mentioned, Craig's Bond is not the type of Bond that I am used to.  The character was just way too brooding for my tastes.  However, this is not necessarily a knock against Daniel Craig's acting ability.  I have seen him in a few other movies in the past, and he is perfectly suited to play a rougher Bond, as clearly shown in Casino Royale.  I appreciate the fact that the creators of this movie wanted to try something different to shake up the franchise's formula, but I'll wait on the next movie to say whether they've succeeded or not. <br /> <br />In the end, Casino Royale is a pretty good action movie, but it just wasn't as good as I hoped it would be.  However, I am more than willing to give Daniel Craig's Bond another chance, and as such, I will hold judgment on this new take on Bond until the next movie comes out.   <br /> <br /> <br />My final score: 7/10 (a mild thumbs-up)
B00005JPCA|5.0|Splendid!  This movie harkens back to the Sean Connery Bonds.  Craig makes a dangerous and dark Bond.   The look, the eyes, it is all perfect.  I can fully overlook the blonde hair.   <br /> <br />The action sequences are very visceral and physical. The gadgets are very grounded and reasonable.  The story is simple and elegant.  One of the things I like about it is that, although they embellished it a great deal, the story stays true to the Ian Fleming original, and Ian Fleming would really like this Bond I think.   People who have not read the books WILL think this is a departure.  I think not.   <br /> <br />Two PPKs up for this Bond.  I look forward to this new re-invented Bond and I hope they keep it up.  Welcome home, Mr. Bond!
0684800713|5.0|The Sun Also Rises is one of the very early works of Ernest Hemingway and it reflects Hemingway's passion for bullfighting.<br /><br />The story line seems a little shallow on the surface. Told from the viewpoint of one of the main characters, Jake Barnes a group of writers in Paris decide to go to Madrid for the running of the bulls and to view the bullfights. An English woman by the name of Brett Ashley whom this group all seem to be pining for tags along. Jake is very much in love with her, but has been rendered sexually disfunctional by a war wound. Her presence causes a certain amount of strife and rivalry within the group. This tension erupts into some mild violence when one of the main characters, Robert Cohen becomes consumed with jealousy.<br /><br />The average plot however is overpowered by the powerful prose of Hemingway. Even in this early work (This was his first novel) the lean, raw style of his writing was present. His descriptions of trout fishing, the running of the bulls and of the matadors in the arena were brought to life with the hard gritty prose that would win him a Nobel prize thirty years later.<br /><br />This story is well worth reading if not for the story itself, which is really not bad, but for the enjoyment of the style of Hemingway. One of the twentieth centuries most influential writers.
0307346609|5.0|World War Z is the best zombie book that I have read in years.  I wish that I could give it 6 stars.  I really enjoyed the realistic (at least plausable) approach.  This book could make you belive. Even the dust cover and introduction maintain the realistic approach.  It is a world wide view of the beginning, duration, and end of the zombie war.  It broke new zombie ground.  It is well written and very entertaining.  I loved it.
B000002UTY|5.0|Searing, tremulous guitar leads from Cipollina and Duncan, gripping vocals, and raw power lift this album to the very top of late 60's psychedelic rock. Standout track: \\"Calvary\\". This record logged more miles on my turntable than any I've owned since I bought it in 1969. Capitol must have made them pretty well; it's outlasted many that I played less. If you get the CD, play and replay often.    Caution: there are many sections where seemingly nothing is happening but feedback and instrumental noodling - \\"navel-gazing\\" music, some may call it. Be patient - these are interludes between powerful musical passages. Although much of it sounds improvised at first listening, I'm convinced it's either (1) been meticulously worked out beforehand, or (2) the result of something bordering on telepathy among the players, who recorded the whole thing live at the Fillmore and in the studio.     The instrumental \\"Calvary\\" is an epic showpiece, recorded live in the studio. It features majestic flamenco-tinged guitar sequences, otherwordly choruses, and beyond that is indescribable to the point where a lone vocal interjects \\"Call it anything you want!\\" near the end.    The final track that follows is \\"Happy Trails\\", credited to Dale Evans. My wife just suggested to me that the line \\"Happy trails to you...until we meet again\\" could be QMS's homage to the Jesus referenced in \\"Calvary\\". Sounds plausible. Amen.
0312340958|5.0|In this, [Book One of Two], written twelve years after Karen Armstrong left her life as a nun, she describes the genesis of her vocation or \\"calling\\" and reveals how reluctant her parents were about letting her embrace a life of ascetism. She was a mere seventeen years old at the time.<br /><br />What follows is a chronicle of what it was like to go through the rigors of becoming a nun. The nine months as a postulant, the two years noviceship, the two years of the scholasticate.... the mind-numbing discipline of achieving full-fledged nunnery-ness (my word).<br /><br />She was one of the last people to go through the old system before it was reformed by the Second Vatican Council and Pope John XXIII. In what I consider extreme generosity, she admits that her own immaturity was the cause of many of her difficulties, but ultimately what happens is that Karen finds out that she is simply not suited for the life of a nun.<br /><br />In the convent, God was conspicuous only by His perceived absence, and confessing this to her superiors was not helpful. It only sent her back into herself and confirmed her theory that God's silence was her own fault. In all of the seven years on the inside, never once did she \\"hear from God\\" nor realize the pre-convent aspirations of her heart. It is a powerful story of religious devotion gone awry.<br /><br />I could talk forever about how IMPORTANT I think this book is.<br /><br />An excellent read!

With his soothing voice of thoughts and sounds, Lisa Hannigan and himself, transform this 10-track masterpiece into beautiful music.

His music, although soulful, this time around will wind you though a variety of upbeat tracks that seem just as interesting as his landmark ballads.  This release is not to be missed.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Expertly avoiding the clich&eacute;s of the well-worn noir genre, Rian Johnson's Brick has one of the most interesting premises in years. By setting his twisty noir tale in a modern day high school, Rian Johnson has breathed fresh life into a style long thought dead. The fact that the setting and style fit together so well ends up being quite a pay off and makes the story that much more intriguing and enjoyable. Every so often there is a line of dialogue that seems a bit contrived for a high schooler to spit out, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt and company usually devlier these lines without any hitches, grounding the film firmly in reality. Gordon-Levitt is excellent as loner hero Brendan Fry and perfectly fits the noir detective archetype; his mannerisms and relentlessly tough-guy attitude seamlessly bridge the gap between the two worlds. Brendan's character calls to mind a number of noir heroes, but perhaps most interestingly is an homage to the protagonist of Miller's Crossing in a series of scenes that hilariously feature Brendan taking beating after beating in very quick succession. While most of the film maintains a slow, deliberate pace familiar to the genre, one scene in particular, in which Brendan is being chased by an unknown thug, is brilliantly directed and delievers a classic \\"wow\\" moment. The conclusion also features the watermark of its influences as it is fairly easy to predict the who, just not the why. However, this doesn't detract from the quality of the film; it just brings the whole experience to an appropriate close. A wonderful film that succeeds in nearly all respects, Brick is the most enjoyable detective film to come along in years and gives the world a new upcoming writer/director to watch.
B00008CLNQ|4.0|Contrary to several reviewers' comments below, I find Karajan's 1989 performance of the 4th superior to the one included here from 1978. Contrasts are played up more, and there's a spellbinding sense of mystery and an inevitable organic flow among clearly delineated textures that lead to intensely wrought climaxes. By comparison, the '78 performance sounds forced and undifferentiated. In fuller passages the strings dominate to such an extent that the winds and horns are barely perceptible.    The reason I suspect that DG included the earlier 4th over the one from '89 is that the latter is two minutes longer, which would have made it impossible to reissue a complete set of the 1980's performances on two discs. (The second disc in this set totals 80'28.) No apparent re-mastering has been applied to the digital recordings.    Collectively, the 1989 Brahms cycle is Karajan's greatest; there are no weak links. I recommend supplementing the 4th here with the single disc issue from '89, assuming you can still find it used.
B00005JPCA|5.0|Back in 1967 a spoof was made about the Bond franchise that were looking to the probable future of the said franchise.  This movie is the serious version of that film (an attempt to make a serious version of the 1967 movie was thought back then to be a sure failure...but Casino Royale 2006 proved otherwise) The names of the characters were revived..Le Cheffre, M, Vesper, Leitan, etc. but the characters holding those names are completely different from the 1967 characters.  One example is when there was a James Bond TV servies back in the 1950's made for an American audience, James Bond was a CIA agent and Leitan (sorry for the mispelling) was a British agent..now it is Bond who is a British agent and Leitan is a CIA agent.  This is the most accurate portrayal of James Bond for the producers made it very close to the original character Ian Fleming wrote in his novels.  I like this kind of James Bond better!
B000002I2G|1.0|Is it true? Have I found the worst album of all time? I think so. It's a thirty-three minute record with three minutes of enjoyment: the first three minutes of Shaman's Blues (which even then overstays its welcome). The rest? Oh, god. The rest. Well, there's the over-the-top hippy anthem Tell All the People. There are a pair of annoying good-timey blues tunes (Do It; Easy Ride) and one painfully bad one (Wild Child). There's Wishful Sinful, which is painful. Runnin' Blue, a country/soul Otis Redding tribute, is a disgrace to the man's memory thanks in part to Krieger's vocals in the chorus. The overblown, eight-minute title track is an example of how over-the-top Jim could be if he tried. Touch Me, the one everybody knows, is the second-best song on this album, but would've been the second-worst on the debut or Morrison Hotel.<br /><br />Teah, I'd say this is the worst ever, though some of AC/DC's '80's work gives it a run for its money.

0743454529|5.0|The brilliant author/writer/wordmaster Pat Conroy has always been my favorite all-time author.  I love his style, his way with words, his storylines, dialogue, description, and masterful similes.  Another Conroy fan once e-mailed me, asking if I knew anyone else who wrote as well as Conroy.  Well, I did a search and asked some of Amazon's top reviewers and they admitted they couldn't find anyone comparable in style, etc.<br /><br />Well, now I have found Jodi Picoult and I think she's in the same league with Conroy.  Her style is decidedly different, but just as brilliant. MY SISTER'S KEEPER is a real page-turner and frighteningly thought-provoking.<br /><br />For details of why this book is so great, please read Eileen Rieback's great review posted here.  She hits the high-points of the book much better than I ever could; all I know is that in author Jodi Picoult I have FINALLY found the PERFECT BOOK, comparable in brilliance to Pat Conroy.  I especially admired pages 308 through 322 where one of the Fitzgerald teen-agers enjoys her first boyfriend, her first \\"prom.\\"  Picoult certainly understands teen-age angst.  If this chapter doesn't move you from the heights of joy to utmost sadness, nothing will.<br /><br />Even in the midst of a long-awaited vacation I found my eyes glued to the pages of this book, abandoning many of the recreational plans I had made ... even abandoning work on my fourth and fifth novels.  Even as much as I hated for Picoult's amazing story to end, and the Fitzgeralds' family trauma to be resolved, I'm pleased to get back to my own writing ... and my personal vacation pursuits.<br /><br />I have many author friends who have come out with potential best-sellers recently, but this book is undoubtedly the very best I have read since Pat Conroy's BEACH MUSIC.  It's a sure-fire winner with believable characters in a very timely, controversial situation that has been well-researched by Picoult, brilliantly and powerfully written.<br /><br />The NEW YORK TIMES wrote following her debut novel, SONGS OF THE HUMPBACK WHALE (twelve books ago): \\"Picoult spreads her wings and catches an updraft.\\"  To that I add: With this novel (her thirteenth) she now soars with the eagles. ... On second thought, make that angels!<br /><br />WOW!  Wish I could write like her ... which is the same thing I've always said about Pat Conroy.  Now I have two favorites to aspire to.<br /><br />Next I plan to read another of Picoult's books, THE TENTH CIRCLE, but NOT on THIS vacation.<br /><br />SIDENOTE: You may have noticed that Amazon has made some changes to its website.

B000002I2I|4.0|Okay, the Doors roared right out of the gates with the classic debut. They then hit a rut with the awfuul Strange Days; mediocre Waiting for the Sun; and The Soft Parade, which we will never speak of again. This is an improvement, and the closest they came to matching their debut. Strong cuts include Roadhouse Blues; Waiting for the Sun; the funky Peace Frog; and the underrated trilogy Ship of Fools; Land Ho and Maggie Mc'gill (bad lyrics aside, it rocks). The bad? You Make Me Real; stale blueses The Spy and Queen of the Highway; and the formulaic ballad Indian Summer. But along with the debut, this is really the only Doors studio album you need. If you own Legacy: the Absolute Best, that is...

039454272X|4.0|What I always keep in mind about Flaubert is that Raymond Chandler admired him. From my own distant recollections of Flaubert, I'd guess that what appealed to such a craftsman as Chandler was the workmanship - in both authors one has a similar sense that every sentence and indeed every word has been worked on with minute precision. On the other hand, Chandler was scathing about pretentiousness and affectation too. I never managed to finish anything by Flaubert because I found him a bit too literary in an offputting sense, and this was no doubt not his fault but mine. However I have to say that when it comes to Julian Barnes this is now the third novel of his that I have read, and for all his outstanding gifts he is beginning to get on my nerves slightly.<br /><br />There is something rather preening and self-regarding about Barnes, I find. I don't deny him creative originality for a moment, but that comes across to me as being secondary to a wish to exercise and display his accomplishment as a writer. The way this book is put together is undeniably effective. Flaubert has a Dr Bovary, and Dr Bovary has a wife Emma who is unfaithful and kills herself. Barnes has a Dr Braithwaite who has a wife Ellen who was unfaithful and killed herself. Some combination of Dr Braithwaite and Mr Barnes (very skilfully alternated) research Flaubert's life, hanging their researches, cleverly but rather artificially, around the identification of a parrot called Loulou belonging to Flaubert's housekeeper. The significance of the parrot, I'd say, is principally to provide a good eye-catching title for the book rather than anything more essential. Dr Braithwaite is very lacklustre as a personality, and while I'm sure that was deliberate on the author's part I'm equally certain he thought his denouement was more effective and less predictable than I have just found it to be.<br /><br />The way this kind of book takes me is that I find the factual material a lot more involving than the `human interest'. So far as I can tell, the research seems to have been meticulous, and I always like to see popular and superficial misconceptions put right. All the same, I could have done with less self-congratulation from Barnes and in particular with less sense of pettiness in the points he scores. Poor old Enid Starkey! I dare say she annoyed him and for all I know she might have annoyed me too, but the triumphs Barnes awards himself are not really very important. If Barnes wants to be as nitpicking as this I may as well point out to him that `ipsophagy' is a dreadful mixture of Latin and Greek roots, and if he wanted to coin such a term it ought to have been `hautophagy'.<br /><br />Obviously, reactions of this kind are subjective on my part, but this is literature and I don't see any way round that. The author's personality as he projects it is not entirely a sympathetic one to me for the reasons I've attempted to explain, but other readers will doubtless react differently. What seems to me a lot less subjective is the sheer quality of what Barnes does. The man is a master and no two ways about that, I'm happy to agree. The book is all over in less than 200 pages anyway, and it is instructive as well as highly readable. Whether it has fired me up to read more by Julian Barnes is maybe doubtful, but it might just get me to have another go at Flaubert.far as I can tell, the research seems to have been meticulous, and I always like to see popular and superficial misconceptions put right.

B000GY729M|3.0|The Killers' much anticipated follow up album SAM'S TOWN doesn't come across quite as \\"sheeny\\" (for lack of a better word) as The Killers' double platinum debut HOT FUSS did.  While some may view that positively or negatively, one must not forget that that albums sporter first-rate singles including first \\"Somebody Told Me\\", followed by the even more infectious, ubiquitous \\"Mr. Brightside\\", and closing with the slightly less embraced, though strong \\"All These Things I've Done\\". Let's face it people, we were all singing the words to \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and we couldn't resist singing the lines \\"I have soul but I'm not a soldier\\" from \\"All These Things I've Done\\".  SAM'S TOWN is consistent with HOT FUSS and even hearkens to be bigger, more athemic in some respects compared to their debut, but it isn't any better and in some respects it isn't as fun as the debut.<br /><br />Sure, \\"When We Were Young\\" is the addictive single from this album when frontman Brandon Flowers sings \\"He doesn't look a thing like Jesus\\", but it isn't as addictive or as predominant as the hooks from either \\"Somebody Told Me\\" or \\"Mr. Brightside\\".  Sure, the Killers want to be taken seriously and SAM'S TOWN is a good move in that vein of thinking, but it isn't enough to topple the greatness of HOT FUSS.  Opening track \\"Sam's Town\\" is certainly a first rate experiment with more U2 veined rock and roll and while it isn't quite as convincing as U2, it is convincing enough.  The tag at the end of the track certainly works well as well as the chorus.  The timbre of the track is also first rate.<br /><br />\\"Bling (Confession of A King)\\" is another solid first rate track, mixing \\"college\\" rock with the added \\"sheen\\" of keyboards.  \\"Bones\\" is another stand out and \\"The River Is Wild\\" isn't too shabby either.  Too often on SAM'S TOWN everything sounds that same as opposed to being its own seperate entity.  Is SAM'S TOWN bad.

B000065PUE|5.0|This album is definitely the Pixies best work, and even though Kim Deal did not put any of her songs on the album (such as Gigantic on Surfer Rosa), it soars above Surfer Rosa as a whole. Every song is brilliant and the sheer range is incredible. Francis' vocals on songs like Tame are not metal or \\"head-banger\\" at all and the only way one could perceive them as such is if that person has no idea what heavy metal is. But that is beside the point, his vocals are not metal but rather epileptic screams with rhythm, and that is the very reason why they're great. The songs are all great but the best ones are th ones that infuse both their poppier sound and harder-edge such as Debaser. The album is truly a masterpiece (without trying to sound cliche), and although someone has probably told you at least something similar to that before it might have been for the wrong reasons. This is a great album not because of its influence or the fact that it's a picturesque snapshot of Indie-rock in the 80's, but because every song is incredible.
B00005JPCA|5.0|I've been a Bond fan all of my life. My dad and I read the books and saw all of the Roger Moore films together. Both of us hoped that one day the rights to Casino Royale could be bought and the book brought to the big screen. When Daniel Craig got the role I was horrified. I thought he was too short, too ugly and too blonde to pull it off. Well, I am delighted to say that I was wrong. After five minutes I forgot about the hair and remembered that Ian Flemming didn't describe Bond as being a handsome man but as a rugged looking one. Daniel Craig must have studied Sean Connery because he reminded me more of Connery than any of the latter Bonds. He's not soft like Brosnan, and he's not fooling around like Moore sometimes seemed to be, and he's not clearly overwhelmed like Dalton. He is extremely physical, tough looking and has that emotional coolness that Connery showed so well.     The plot is tight and remarkably faithful with a few needed updates to the original book. The gadgets are still here of course but they don't dominate the story like they did in the Brosnan years (Remember the invisible car?). The most amazing piece of equipment is 007, himself.   This is young Bond's first 00 mission and he makes mistakes and isn't bothered about being subtle. His relationship with Vesper was well done and the actress playing the part looks like the character is described in the book. I'm glad the producers decided to keep the torture scene pretty much as Flemming wrote it. Later instead of taking pills and leaving a sad little note Vesper gets a much more dramatic death in the movie and when Craig says the  big line, \\"the b---- is dead,\\" you can really see his heart freezing over.      The audience I saw the movie with oohed, awed, laughed and cheered at all the right moments. Casino Royale  was a fan's dream come true. Congrats to Craig. He pulled it off. He IS the best Bond since Connery.
B000003TA4|5.0|this album was released in 1991 and almost immediately reached incredible success, which only skyrocketed into the stratosphere of legends including the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin following Kurt Cobain' death. Usually when I hear someone comment on this album they either say that Kurt (for some reason never Nirvana) is a poser, sell out, etc., or that he was some sort of boy-genius/messiah figure capable of all except fault. This album is great and so is Nirvana--not just Kurt Cobain. The band is not great because any of its members are a god, but because they wrote amazing songs. None of the members were virtuosos; the songs are, in fact, quite simple, but in their simplicity lies the bands talent. The riffs are grungey, but very catchy--almost as catchy as the lyrics. Although this is not Nirvana's best work (if you want songs that actually might be genius, buy the box set) is an amazing album that deserves your money.(Ignore your dumb indie-obsessed friends' scoffs)

It's not about who is the coolest. :-) <br /> <br />This album is really fun and sweet. It's gentle but upbeat pop music. It's a great backdrop for a lonely bus ride. A few of the tracks are not so polished or a little uneven, but I don't think this detracts from the album. It can be part of the charm. Songs like Expectations, The State I'm In, You're Just A Baby, I Could Be Dreaming and She's Losing It are great fun and upbeat twee pop. With some surprising little twists in the lyrics. <br /> <br />In a word: fun!
0618680004|3.0|I came away from Richard Dawkins, \\"The God Delusion\\", thinking, This guy is deluded. Science, for those like Dawkins, is as much Faith based as Christianity or Islam. The cosmology of the Big Bang starts with a Creationism. Modern science, excepting astrophysics, is based on empiricism. Dawkins can speculate all he wants about our universe because it's impossible to test his assertions. A feature he shares with the Prophet. Dawkins complaint that religious belief requires an impossibly complex Being presumes that his science has resolved our universe. Tell that to your weatherman, Mr Dawkins. This is a faith based view of nature.
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|In January of 2005, Donna Summer released her twenty-eighth album entitled, GOLD, a double-disc greatest hits compilation, featuring just about all of Donna Summer's greatest hits from 1975 to 1979. Sure, this album is almost a repeat to that of THE DONNA SUMMER ANTHOLOGY, but the catch is that there are more tracks to be included past the year of 1992. <br /> <br />Disc One: 1975-1979 <br />LOVE TO LOVE YOU BABY (Single Version) <br />  Original version from the album LOVE TO LOVE YOU BABY (1975). Still an awesome song, but I definitely enjoy hearing it a lot more when it is in its full-length 16:51 (sixteen minute, fifty-one second) version. But it is still an amazing (not to mention: Orgasmic) song. <br /> <br />COULD IT BE MAGIC (Single Version) <br />  Original version from the album A LOVE TRILOGY (1976). Still one of the best cover songs around. I love the Disco-Dance version of this song. <br /> <br />TRY ME, I KNOW WE CAN MAKE IT (Single Version) <br />  Original version from the album A LOVE TRILOGY (1976). It is obvious that the producers of this album were not going to let this song get away with coming onto this compilation in its full 18:00 (eighteen minutes). This here single version is great, but hearing the full eighteen minutes of the song is even better. <br /> <br />SPRING AFFAIR (Single Version) <br />  Original version from the album FOUR SEASONS OF LOVE (1976). Great song, but it is not in its entirety. The album version is a full 8:30 (eight and a half minutes), but I could listen to this song without any problems whatsoever. <br /> <br />LOVE'S UNKIND <br />  From the album I REMEMBER YESTERDAY (1977). A great song. <br /> <br />I FEEL LOVE <br />  From the album I REMEMBER YESTERDAY (1977). Still one of the best Disco songs. <br /> <br />I LOVE YOU <br />  From the album ONCE UPON A TIME...(1977). Another great song. <br /> <br />LAST DANCE <br />  From the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack THANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY (1978). Such a great song.  <br /> <br />MacARTHUR PARK (Promotional Single Version) <br />  Original version from the single MacARTHUR PARK (1978). Another awesome song. The version you see here is the exact version to the original 8:35 (eight minutes, thirty-five seconds) version, except that this is known as the Promotional Single Version, where the last 2:10 (two minutes, ten seconds) were cut from it. Included in those last two minutes, thirty-five seconds were the last instrumental breaks and the final chorus. Still a great song. <br /> <br />HEAVEN KNOWS (Single Version) <br />  Original version from the single HEAVEN KNOWS (1978). Another great song. This version actually is not that different from the original. This track is just twenty-five seconds longer than the original. That's the big difference, really. Still a great song. <br /> <br />HOT STUFF (12\\" Single Version) <br />  Original version from the album BAD GIRLS (1979). Great song, and it only runs a minute longer than the album version. <br /> <br />BAD GIRLS <br />  From the album BAD GIRLS (1979). Great song. <br /> <br />DIM ALL THE LIGHTS <br />  From the album BAD GIRLS (1979). Another classic tune. I really enjoyed the way she performed this song on VH1 PRESENTS DONNA SUMMER: LIVE AND MORE: ENCORE!: starting it off with the ballad portion, but in the way Rod Stewart would have sang it (since Donna had originally written the song for Rod Stewart, where she chickened out in giving it to him), and then flowing into the dance portion of the song, which sounds more like a Donna Summer recording. Classic song. <br /> <br />SUNSET PEOPLE <br />  From the album BAD GIRLS (1979). Great song. <br /> <br />NO MORE TEARS (ENOUGH IS ENOUGH) (performed by Barbra Streisand & Donna Summer) <br />  Original version from Barbra Streisand's album WET (1979). Great song, still the best Diva Duet I have ever heard. <br /> <br />ON THE RADIO <br />  From the album ON THE RADIO: GREATEST HITS VOLUMES I & II (1979). Another classic song that is still being played \\"On The Radio\\". <br /> <br />Disc Two: 1979-1999 <br />THE WANDERER <br />  From the album THE WANDERER (1980). Awesome. <br /> <br />LOVE IS IN CONTROL (FINGER ON THE TRIGGER) <br />  From the album DONNA SUMMER (1982). Great song. <br /> <br />STATE OF INDEPENDENCE <br />  From the album DONNA SUMMER (1982). Great. <br /> <br />SHE WORKS HARD FOR THE MONEY <br />  From the album SHE WORKS HARD FOR THE MONEY (1983). Great song. <br /> <br />UNCONDITIONAL LOVE (performed by Donna Summer & Musical Youth) <br />  From the album SHE WORKS HARD FOR THE MONEY (1983). Awesome song. <br /> <br />THERE GOES MY BABY <br />  From the album CATS WITHOUT CLAWS (1984). Great. <br /> <br />SUPERNATURAL LOVE <br />  From the album CATS WITHOUT CLAWS (1984). Great. <br /> <br />DINNER WITH GERSHWIN <br />  From the album ALL SYSTEMS GO (1987). Awesome. <br /> <br />ALL SYSTEMS GO <br />  From the album ALL SYSTEMS GO (1987). Amazing. <br /> <br />THIS TIME I KNOW IT'S FOR REAL <br />  From the album ANOTHER PLACE AND TIME (1989). Still one of my favorites. <br /> <br />I DON'T WANNA GET HURT <br />  From the album ANOTHER PLACE AND TIME (1989). Great song. <br /> <br />LOVE'S ABOUT TO CHANGE MY HEART (7\\" Mix) <br />  Original version the album ANOTHER PLACE AND TIME (1989). Great song. <br /> <br />WHEN LOVE CRIES (7\\" Mix) <br />  Original version from the album MISTAKEN IDENTITY (1991). Awesome. <br /> <br />FRIENDS UNKNOWN <br />  From the album MISTAKEN IDENTITY (1991). Amazing song. <br /> <br />CARRY ON <br />  From Giorgio Moroder's album FOREVER DANCING (1992). Great song. <br /> <br />I WILL GO WITH YOU (CON TE PARTIRO) <br />  From the album VH1 PRESENTS DONNA SUMMER: LIVE AND MORE: ENCORE! (1999). Great song to dance to. <br /> <br />DREAM-A-LOT'S THEME (I WILL LIVE FOR LOVE) <br />  From the album THE JOURNEY: THE VERY BEST OF DONNA SUMMER (2003). Great song. <br /> <br />YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL (Tony Moran Edit) <br />  PreviouslyUnreleased. Great. <br /> <br />    So far, this is the last Donna Summer album to be released, where we fans are still awaiting the arrival of another Donna Summer album. Hopefully, whenever Donna Summer releases her next album, it will be as great as the last twenty-eight albums she has released.
B000BYA5G4|5.0|This tight, well mounted and extremely well acted, produced and directed film, LORD OF THE WAR, brings to light the ugly underbelly of the world of professional arms dealers.  Nicholas Cage is absolutely believable as the purveyor of illicit arms to some of the world's most unsavory dictators.  This is an important film, and while disturbing, perhaps because it is so disturbing, it should be seen by everyone.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|In September of 2003, Donna Summer released her twenty-seventh album entitled, THE JOURNEY: THE VERY BEST OF DONNA SUMMER. This is, yet, another great album by the Queen of Disco, despite the fact that it is missing a few tracks here, a few tracks there. But still a great compilation. <br /> <br />LOVE TO LOVE YOU BABY <br />  From the album LOVE TO LOVE YOU BABY (1975). Still a great song. <br /> <br />COULD IT BE MAGIC <br />  From the album A LOVE TRILOGY (1976). Just simply an amazing cover. It's a song that I could really dance to. <br /> <br />I FEEL LOVE <br />  From the album I REMEMBER YESTERDAY (1977). An amazing song. I love it's Disco-vibe. <br /> <br />I LOVE YOU <br />  From the album ONCE UPON A TIME...(1977). Great song. <br /> <br />LAST DANCE <br />  From the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack THANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY (1978). Still a classic after all of these years. <br /> <br />MacARTHUR PARK <br />  From the single MacARTHUR PARK (1978). Great song. This is definitely a song that I could really dance to. <br /> <br />HEAVEN KNOWS <br />  From the single HEAVEN KNOWS (1978). Another great Disco song. <br /> <br />HOT STUFF <br />  From the album BAD GIRLS (1979). This is, yet, another great song, with it's Rock-Disco combination. <br /> <br />BAD GIRLS <br />  From the album BAD GIRLS (1979). Awesome. <br /> <br />DIM ALL THE LIGHTS <br />  From the album BAD GIRLS (1979). Great song. <br /> <br />NO MORE TEARS (ENOUGH IS ENOUGH) (performed by Barbra Streisand & Donna Summer) <br />  Original version from Barbra Streisand's album WET (1979). Still the best Diva Duet in the history of music. <br /> <br />ON THE RADIO <br />  From the album ON THE RADIO: GREATEST HITS VOLUMES I & II (1979). Awesome song. I could definitely tear up the dance floor with this track. <br /> <br />THE WANDERER <br />  From the album THE WANDERER (1980). Another great song, with Donna Summer leaving Disco behind. <br /> <br />LOVE IS IN CONTROL (FINGER ON THE TRIGGER) <br />  From the album DONNA SUMMER (1982). Awesome tune. <br /> <br />STATE OF INDEPENDENCE <br />  From the album DONNA SUMMER (1982). Awesome tune. <br /> <br />SHE WORKS HARD FOR THE MONEY <br />  From the album SHE WORKS HARD FOR THE MONEY (1983). Great song. <br /> <br />THIS TIME I KNOW IT'S FOR REAL <br />  From the album ANOTHER PLACE AND TIME (1989). I'll never forget the day when I first heard this song. The minute I heard it, I instantly fell in love with it. This is one of Donna Summer's great dance tunes of the '80s. <br /> <br />I WILL GO WITH YOU (CON TE PARTIRO) <br />  From the album VH1 PRESENTS DONNA SUMMER: LIVE AND MORE: ENCORE! (1999). An awesome song. I must have listened to this one at least ten times. <br /> <br />THAT'S THE WAY <br />  Previously unreleased. Great. <br /> <br />DREAM-A-LOT'S THEME (I WILL LIVE FOR LOVE) <br />  Previously unreleased. Great. <br /> <br />    Even though I am asking myself, \\"How many 'Greatest Hits' compilations can someone have?\\", this compilation is still very amazing, even though the compilation is missing the following: \\"Spring Affair\\", \\"I Remember Yesterday\\", \\"Our Love\\", \\"Once Upon A Time\\", \\"Rumour Has It\\", \\"Sunset People\\", \\"Cold Love\\", \\"Unconditional Love\\" (performed by Donna Summer & Musical Youth), \\"There Goes My Baby\\", \\"Supernatural Love\\", \\"All Systems Go\\", \\"I Don't Want To Get Hurt\\", \\"Love's About To Change My Heart\\", \\"When Love Cries\\", \\"Friends Unknown\\", & \\"Carry On\\". But still a great compilation.
0722532938|4.0|Paulo Coelho was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1947, has been awarded France's Legion d'Honneur, Italy's Grinzane Cavour and was inducted into the Brazilian Academy of Letters in 2002. \\"The Alchemist\\" is invariably blurbed as \\"much loved\\" and was first published in 1988. <br /> <br />\\"The Alchemist\\" tells the story of Santiago, a native of Andalusia. He had trained, briefly, for the priesthood though had always been keen to travel. As a result, he left the seminary  and - since the only Andalusians who travelled were shepherds - bought some sheep. As the story begins, he has just arrived - aptly enooough - at an abandoned church where he is planning to shelter for the night. That night, for the second time in about a week, he dreams of being taken to the Pyramids by a girl. There, she promises him a hidden treasuer if he comes to the Pyramids when awake. Although he has his dream interpreted in a nearby town, he only decides to follow his dream following a conversation with a man who calims to be the King of Salem.  <br /> <br />\\"The Alchemist\\" is a very short, pleasant, easily-read book and has a message I'd really love to believe : everyone has a single goal in life (even if we don't realise it) and that the Earth itself wants us to be happy. Maybe I've just become too cynical over the yeras, but I couldn't honestly describe it as anything other then fluff - very likeable fluff, admittedly, though still fluff. Coelho himself has become an alchemist of sorts with this book, though he hasn't needed to turn lead into gold : he's made his fortune telling people to chase their dreams and to follow the right omens.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I am so glad this CD is out!  I think its great that Josh plays drums in \\"You are Loved\\".  That is so cool.  The CD is wonderful, and so is he.
B000J103X4|5.0|Anything with Nas on it, gets 5 Stars from me! I loved \\"Why You Hate The Game\\" and the chix voice from Floetry was flawless too! Good job Game :)
B000I5X81K|4.0|Groban's voice is flawless & heavenly as usual.  I just didn't get as many tingling sensations listening to this one as the previous ones.  It's still great - don't get me wrong!  As with most albums, regardless of the genre, I find myself skipping at least one or two songs.  I found myself doing this more often on this release when compared to the debut and sophmore releases.  He still displays his talent & range beautifully, both vocally & in song-writing ability.<br /><br />I AM glad he didn't do as much experimentation in this one as in previous releases (adding techno sounding keyboards/fading vocals, etc).  According to one of his interviews he was trying to put a new sound & modernization into this kind of vocalization.  I applause his attempt but I still preferred the traditional string or piano accompaniment.  I also firmly believe that those who don't appreciate this kind of music will not change their minds regardless of how many keyboards & sound bending effects to your song.  If I had to rate the albums so far I'd have to say: Closer is the best, Josh Groban 2nd & Awake 3rd.  I STILL LOVE JG!
0684867184|3.0|This is an easy, one day read about friendships.  Not a bad book, but we are so used to the brilliance of Ambrose that we, or me anyway, may have had higher expectations than this book brought.  It was a pretty good read, but most of all it made me want to read more of some of the friendships included.  I'm an Ambrose fan so am glad to have this effort in my library.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This release was just stunning!  There were probably only 2-3 songs I could have lived without but two in particular I think I can listen to over & over again for the rest of my life and still feel as if I'm floating away to heaven!  Those are Remember When It Rained (which Groban co-wrote) & Si Volvieras a Mi.  If you were fortunate enough to hear the bonus tracks Mi Moreno & My December, boy, you're LUCKY!  I loved them so much.  This one is so far my favorite Groban album.  He had the luxory of co-writing a few songs on this release.  WAY TO GO GROBAN!  Showcase that talent!
B000244FDW|3.0|This 1985 BBC mini-series is an adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel.  While all Austen novels revolve around the universally acknowledged truth that, \\"a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" her protagonists are always of the fairer sex.<br /><br />Jane Austen novels are set at a slower time and written for people who had the time to read them.  They are leisurely affairs to be read over days.  That production, with 265 minutes on a two-sided disk has the time to develop the plot.  Although the opening scene is significantly altered from Austen's novel, whole pages of text are presented verbatim.  Unfortunately, the acting is more like that of a stage production with long lines of dialogue.  The actors often delivered their lines word for word from the book but these were talking heads.  They regularly stood tall and stiff with only slight interaction with the set and sadly limited facial expression or feeling.  Mr. Collins, in this version, is closer to the person described by Austen, handsome not all that bright and overly concerned with class and status.  The cinematography is generally good but sometimes the lighting would leave faces in shadow for no apparent reason.  The musical score was weak and dated.  My wife, also an aficionado of period movies, felt this version was agony and quit watching.<br /><br />While there is a 1939 version of Pride and Prejudice, with Maureen O'Sullivan, I have not yet seen it.  The three versions I have seen and reviewed are the 1996 BBC and A&E version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, the 2005 Universal Studios version with Keira Knightley and this 1985 BBC production.  I can recommend the first two versions, for different reasons, but this adaptation is flawed and the least enjoyable of the three.<br /><br />Kyle Pratt
B00008S2VG|5.0|(Note: This isn't really Ken Meyers, this is his daughter who always purchases stuff under this name) <br /> <br />Yeah, I know what the critics have said. This is Madonna's worst album. Well I hate to say it but until I bought this album and REALLY listened to it, I believed them. When I finally bought it, I realized how stupid they really are and that this is actually one of Madonna's BEST albums and the reasons that they don't like it are probably because it's daring, innovative, edgy, and most of all, the lyrics are true. It's unfortunate that they would rather listen to cookie-cutter pop than this, but whatever. I blame it on the wrong time, the war, and the high approval ratings for Bush, but now, three years later and when Bush's approval ratings are in the toilet, it's time to see the genius that is American Life. (BTW if the problem is the Parental Advisory, get the clean version, that's what I did. They have one on here.)
B00005JPCA|5.0|Like many here I was very sceptical about this film. In fact in fact I was down right angry, I thought with the casting of Craig they were ruining a character I considered to be a hero, and that the film would be a disaster.<br /><br />However I was (pleasantly) proven wrong Craig obviously took up the gantlet thrown down by skeptics such as myself. And not only met my expectations but surpassed them. He also showed that Bond could be portrayed in a different manner than he has been shown for the last 40 years. And it could still be enjoyed.  This is far and away the best and most emotionally satisfying James Bond film I have ever seen.<br /><br />I think it's unfair to say that Craig is the best Bond since Connery. Craig as Bond is in a class completely by himself. This is a completely new Bond for the 21st century. I love Brosnan as Bond, but Craig just floored me.<br /><br />  Craig's Bond is a 'soldier' for her Majesties Goverment. But a soldier with a heart and who is also very likable. Craig does not try to be slick or charming like Moore, Brosan or even Connery. He's just straight and down to earth. This is the James Bond directly from the book. He's very much a diamond in the rough.  And very likable.<br /><br />The only major problem I had was with the action scenes in the beginning. I think they should have been interspersed with more drama, because it really made Craig look like a one dimensinal thug. And the construction scene while enjoyable. Really seemed out of place, would a proffesional like Bond really go tearing around like a lunatic like that.<br /><br />Other than that I thought it was an excellent film. One which can be enjoyed continuously.
B0000214F3|5.0|If you have an MTV attention span, you do not need to read further. Otherwise, let me tell you about this movie that has something for almost everyone. Naysayers will argue that it is too long. My personal opinion about ANY movie is--If it's good, then it doesn't matter how long it is (see Dances with Wolves, Titanic, Braveheart,etc.) <br />This is an even-paced movie that lets you get a glimpse into all of the characters without becoming a tedious 7 character analysis. It is a love story. It is a tragedy. It is a drama. William Parrish's tragic tale of a life near ending is somehow uplifted by his recognizing all of his accomplishments, and his children's happiness. His daughter Susan is rescued from her seemingly corporate relationship with a cad. His other daughter is supported greatly by a lovable shlub named Quince. All in all, this makes us look at our lives perhaps. For all the bad things that may have happened, it is, overall, a beautiful life and adventure. Take the time to immerse yourself in this movie. If you don't get goosebumps at the end scene, then you may not be human.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Others have already left a plot synopsis, so I'll be brief.  This is the best movie I've seen in years. This film made me laugh,cry,and want to see more of the talented cast. The storyline is quirky - it's a tearjerker and comedy rolled into one fabulous tale. This is a movie that will go on my \\"keep\\" shelf. Although the \\"F\\" word is used liberally, it's still a heartwarming story of a band of misfits that happen to be family uniting to make one little girl happy. It's fabulous!
0446528056|5.0|Once again a great book from Nicholas Sparks, i've read them all, and Nicholas is always true to what would happen in real life.  He doesn't write about \\"fairytales\\" its all true to what happens in real life.  This was a moving story of what true love is, and allowing another to be happy.  He gave a small window into what it must be like for those serving our country overseas and didn't make it a rosey story that makes the world look perfect.  Definitely a sad story but one that leaves you inspired to hope, that you could do the same for someone that you loved that much.  If you are looking for the fairytale ending, this book isn't for you, but if you want a story that you could actually see happening its amazing.  I look forward to his next book.
B000J10ERO|3.0|My friends and I went into the movie theater with no expectations and amazingly we all came out dissapointed. For me personally, the movie had me until the evil plot and it just went downhill from there. I mean Lex Luthor goes into the \\"Fortress of solitude\\" which has all the secrets of the universe and all he comes out with is a crystal  of a planet that BEW UP!  <br /> <br />I didn't buy it but sinced I like Superman I went with it, but then he actually grows this island and man, it looks like a place that no one would want to come within 500 feet of let alone live on it. I'm supposed to believe that people would pay millions to live on this barren wasteland?! <br /> <br />Also Superman stepped on the island and he was instantly so weak that Lex could punch him down a flight of stairs but yet we're supposed to believe that after a short bath in the sun he can lift that island into space? Did I mention the Kryponite was like IN HIS FACE. I'm sorry but no, you can't set up that Kryptonite made his sooo weak and then suddenly change your mind out of convience. I know they tried to make up for it by putting him in the hospital and I respect them for that. They gained an extra star for effot but that's about it. If your someone who just like Superman. If you're not someone who gets all nostalgic and tearly eyed because you're being reminded of your childhood days when you see this movie, then you're not going to be able to look past the way the script takes a turn for the worst in the second half.
B00006CXSS|5.0|There are very few cinematographic works on war experiences that can match this one. Gripping, compelling, and with a sympathetic portrayal of all its characters and events which manage to be not stereotypical but as impartial as it can be when told from the winner's side. It makes fascinating viewing of human motivation, brilliance and failure. Above all repsect for the other human being, whatever the position and choices in life is the undercurrent that shines through all the layers of activity. Something we can and should all connect to...<br /><br />I spent some of my first 8 years of life in the aftermath of the war ravaged Cologne in Germany. For a child it was hard to understand why much of the city was still in ruins, so many buildings deeply pockmarked, not to mention the psyche of those who had survived and had to get on with life. This series helped me put many things in perspective, such as relatives fighting on both sides of the lines, and the human aspects that, even though we often think we cannot make a difference in the world, we do so with every breath we take.<br /><br />If I were teaching history I'd make this series compulsory viewing.
B000GDH9J6|5.0|This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen.  It's a semi-documentary shot on location.  That river the actors across to capture the skinner family is actually located in Kekexili, according to the National Geographic website on the film.  The story is simple yet powerful.  The ending is just incredible.  A must-see. <br /> <br />It's reported that only three of the actors in the film are pros: the reporter, the ringleader of the patrol, and the guy in the quicksand scene.  The girl is really pretty; too bad she doesn't get much screen time. <br /> <br />You owe it to yourself to see this memorable film.
B00005JPCA|5.0|MOVIE: The James Bond franchise is the most successful series of films in cinema history. So, when it was announced that Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson were looking to revamp the franchise there were some areas of concern. The biggest shocker to hit the film industry was that Pierce Brosnan was out and that it was time for a new Bond. Rumors began circling like crazy. Actors like Clive Owen, Hugh Jackman, and a dozen more were rumored to be the next actor to fill the role. When Daniel Craig was announced as the official Bond a roar of opposition came from fans all over. There was even a \\"Craig Is Not Bond\\" website that started a petition to get the producers to change their minds. It was a sad and humiliating exhibition on the part of the fans, to make judgements based solely on the actor's previous works and different looks from the other Bonds. I mean honestly, who thought Tobey McGuire was going to be Spider-Man, that Christian Bale was going to be the new Batman, and a bunch of other iconic roles. The fact here is that Daniel Craig makes an excellent Bond.<br /><br />  Casino Royale was the first book written by Ian Fleming, and it introduced the world to James Bond. After a decade of inconsistent and so-so Bond films it was decided that character needed to return to his roots, back to the basics. Bond films started to become nothing but mere parodies of themselves. Die Another Day was the biggest sign that a few changes needed to be made. The last great Bond film was GoldenEye so it was logical to call back director Martin Campbell to direct Casino Royale. Another big thing to note about this film is that Paul Haggis was brought on board to do some rewrites, to solidify the script and fully develop the characters. Past Bond films had such laughably bad dialogue that the witty puns the series made famous became poorly executed and just shameful. The plots got so over the top even for Bond films. Die Another Day featured a giant laser, an ice palace, a bi-racial bad guy, and some thug with diamonds in his face. With Casino Royale we go back to the basics of Bond yet we still retain the class and themes that make Bond what he is.<br /><br />  The film's opening sequence is the shortest of all the films (not counting Dr. No since it did not have one). We see that James Bond has just been promoted to double-0 status, we then cut directly into the amazing main titles. Chris Cornell delivers a very Bondesque song with David Arnold arranging the classy orchestral sound mixed in with Cornell's style. The title song is called \\"You Know My Name\\", and the titles are highly stylized animatics that use the poker theme of the film. The plot is simple, a terrorist banker decides to raise money to fund a terrorist cell by winning a high stakes poker game at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. Bond is assigned to win the game thus crippling Le Chiffre and the cell. Things go wrong mostly from the mistakes that Bond makes, which is brilliant. This is Bond as a beginner, so he makes plenty of bad choices. In the first action scene, a thrilling foot chase through a construction site, we see Bond stumbling and struggling to catch up with the fugitive. The scene is absolutely amazing and is really the most amazing foot chase I have ever seen on film. Other amazing action sequences include a rundown at the Miami Airport, a staircase fight with a machete wielding crime lord, a shootout in a collapsing building, and just as tense are the poker scenes. I was reluctant of the choice to drop the game of Baccarat and replace it with Texas Hold 'Em, but it was an appropriate choice considering that times have changed. Poker definitely worked and the games are incredibly tense.<br /><br />  Another aspect of this installment is that it is notably more violent than the other Bond films. We also see more blood than we have scene in Bond films before this. In the novel there is a really graphic torture scene and I was wondering how they were going tohandle it. They toned it down, but it still will make the men in the theater cringe and thanks to Paul Haggis' touchups he inserted the film's funniest line in the torture scene, which worked perfectly. The violence adds an intensity that really elevates the film and makes it a worthy adaptation since the novel itself was really dark.<br /><br />  While the film has its questionable changes they are all for the better. For one, Judi Dench is M even though Bernard Lee plays the role in the original films up till GoldenEye. There is also talk of \\"post 9/11\\" even though the original films stay in their time period of when they were made. If the next Bond film attempts to continue the idea of this new Bond then it will be a big mistake. The next film has to return hitting the ground running as if it were the same old Bond. Even so, this is an incredible action film and an incredible Bond film. Casino Royale is an amazing and is equal to the quality of the Connery days. It is also one of the best action films ever made in my opinion.<br /><br />ACTING: Daniel Craig is a brilliant Bond and that is all there is to it. The character is quiet as he comes to terms with his environment, we feel that he is out of his element and is slowly molding into the James Bond that we have come to love and know over the past 45 years. Daniel Craig molds the perfect Bond to show guts and arrogance that end up teaching him lessons about how to handle the profession. James Bond doesn't become Bond until the very end of the film and that is enhanced by David Arnold's score. He uses the theme that was established in the main title song, but not once do we hear the James Bond theme. We only hear the theme at the very end when James becomes Bond. Any doubts that Craig was a poor choice should be thrown out, and people who doubted him before with such a passion should bite their tongue and take the shame of being horribly wrong. In terms of supporting roles we have Eva Green, Madds Mikkelson as the villain, and Jeffrey Wright as Felix. Eva Green is the perfect female lead in the film, and you really can't call her a \\"Bond Girl\\". She has a presence you can respect and she is not just there as eye candy and a toy for Bond. Madds Mikkelson makes the perfect Le Chiffre, a Bond villain that of course has a some sort of physical distinction like every Bond villain should have. The roles are well written and for the first time we see some real pathos in the Bond franchise.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Casino Royale is genuinely thrilling and works on every level, truly a Bond film that stacks up with the best in the franchise. Daniel Craig will wow you as Bond and I guarantee you'll have a blast at the movies whether you've seen every Bond film before this or you are completely new to it.how they were going to handle it.

B000H30B2C|5.0|As remakes go, this is one of the best and most valid remakes I have ever seen. It should have swept the Oscars and is without a doubt one of the best fantasy films ever made! One of the greatest films of all time gets a high tech upgrade. I really wish that purist could see why this is so beautifully done.<br /><br />I think the extended version is even better in some areas and it runs quite a bit longer, but strangely it seems shorter! I have heard many complaints about this film being too unrealistic? The movie is about a giant gorilla! It is a fantasy film \\"kids\\"! So when we see situations that don't seem possible, please keep this in mind.<br /><br />The original King Kong is one of my favorite movies of all time, but I'm glad this film didn't follow the original note for note. Is it better than the original? Well...In some ways yes and in some ways no. The connection between Ann and Kong,  which a lot of people had problems with,  is welcome, as it makes the story much more interesting and heartfelt. I think Jackson should be commended for his efforts and this could very well be his crown jewel! Both the original and this remake deserve to be in everyone's movie collection!<br /><br />The new extended edition is a worthy purchase as it has a lot of interesting added scenes that should have been in the theatrical release. There is also a ton of great new extras! I wish Peter Jackson would try to remake Son of Kong into as good a movie.....now if he can pull that off.......;-b
B000J4QWMC|1.0|I don't want to even waste time writing a long review for this terrible movie.  I honestly is worse than a bad crime B movie.  First of all, it starts off with no explanation of what is happening, there is no character development, nor any legible plotline.  The dialog is congested and uncomprehendable.  You will feel as if someone threw you into the middle of a movie and left you with nothing but two actors that have no chemistry or longing to engage you. I was lucky enough to get my money back, I only hope anyone else will not waste their time buying and watching this sorry excuse for a film.
0385751060|4.0|Teaching children about recent historical atrocities is always difficult. It's hard for them to believe that human beings can treat others brutally.  It's an element of grace that children find it hard to believe the events we know to be true about the Holocaust and more recently, Darfur, can occur.<br /><br />Imagine what it would be like for a nazi commander's naive nine year old son to realize his father was part of his best friend's nightmare, and you'll get some idea of the power of this book.<br /><br />It is told thru the voice of a nine year old boy as he witnesses events he never fully comprehends.  Does the barbed wire around \\"Out With\\", his way of pronouncing Auschwitz, keep his family from playing with those inside?  Why can't he go in?  Why are there so many children inside and none outside where he lives?<br /><br />Bruno, this nine year old boy, also calls the Fuhrer, the Fury.  Appropriately,  but of course not intentionally.  It's the way he speaks.<br /><br /> I think most people who have read extensively about the Holocaust would relish a book that gives some insight into how a nazi's children would have felt about what went on, had they had any knowledge about the camps.  I know that for years I wondered why there aren't books filled with interviews of such children, explaining how they've assimilated their parent's behaviour into their own personal histories.<br /><br />This book is well done.  I highly recommend it.
0375831002|5.0|Zusak's engrossing tale of two children, struggling to grow up, survive and comprehend the adult world of Hitler's Germany demonstrates the horrifying impact of mass brainwashing and negative social conditioning.  Yet this author has chosen to create not Jewish protagonists but decent German kids who will learn to steal more than books--the very hearts of readers.  Their trials at school, inevitable parental discipline, dealing with gangs and the beginning of puppy love are universal in appeal.  Even children can impact the lifestyle of the adults in their immediate social sphere. But how can they sort out what really is Stealing, from that which is acceptable borrowing or haphazard acquisition? <br /> <br /> Also exploring the theme of the price of bearing a social conscience, THE BOOK THIEF offers incredible insights into friendship, family loyalty, decency and moral obligation. This thick YA book (550 pages) revels in the power of words, both written and spoken, even those words which never were--but should have been--spoken aloud. <br /> <br /> Related by the ubiquitous narrator, the story in interspersed with comments on mankind by Death--the patient and overburdened soul-gatherer. The grim plotline, which culminates in the bombing of Munich, is lightened by the juvenile antics of Liesel and Rudy, neighbors on Himmel Street--an area which becomes increasingly less Heaven-like.  The Narrator occasionally interrupts the strict chronology with references to the past or the future; such somber foreshadowing only increases the tension, as opposed to destroying the joy of literary discovery.  It is several years after the death of her little brother and complete physical separation from her mother that Liesel starts collecting her own library, from unusual sources.  But each book is precious to her, either because of the content, the author or the price of acquisition. <br /> <br /> Liesel's young life is shaped by three wonderful males; a giver of teddy bears and bread; a man with music in his heart and hands; and a grateful, secret man whom she inspired to write and illustrate his autobiography. Having learned the precious art of Humanitarianism from Hans, both Leisel and Rudy continue (however unwisely) to practice his life lessons of compassion--recognizing the universality of Mankind.  A gripping tale not just for young adults, for but for caring people of all ages and countries.  If the author were American THE BOOK THIEF would be a sure-fire Newbery winner.   <br /> <br />
B000IU3XTW|5.0|I have been a Foo Fan since the beginning.  Everything Dave touches turns to gold, and this is no exception.  People who think this is 'just another acoustic cd' should take a good listen; you will change your minds. <br /> <br />The selection of music in this show couldn't have been any better, and the performance is nothing less than exceptional.  The Foos know what their fans want and they give it to them.  This record stacks up with the best of the best, and it will remain a staple of my collection for years to come. <br /> <br />This was an easy 5/5.  I wish I could go higher. <br />
B000GY729M|4.0|The Killers return with their sophomore set, \\"Sam's Town\\". This time out, they emerge more confident and with a harder guitar-driven edge. The synths are still here, but they're pushed to the back, or utilized to help the melodies along. There are plenty of hit singles here such as their first, \\"When You Were Young\\" with its U2-like chorus and guitar flourishes. The title track is a mix of Duran Duran and Rush while \\"Bling (Confession Of A King)\\" and \\"For Reasons Unkown\\" emphasize the tougher guitars while maintaining a delicate balance of synths. \\"Read My Mind\\" would be my choice for second single. The band hits a few speed bumps along the way during the second half of the disc with \\"Uncle Jonny\\" and \\"My List\\", but this is more than compensated for with other good songs \\"Bones\\", \\"This River Is Wild\\" and \\"Why Do I Keep Counting?\\".<br /><br />The Killers avoid the sophomore slump issue and show that they are here to stay. Strong melodies, rocking guitars and intelligent/poetic lyrics keep \\"Sam's Town\\" a cut above other releases of 2006.
1883217040|5.0|My frustration with this book is the considerable overlap between it and the Jazz Piano Book, also by Mark Levine.  I bought the Jazz Piano book first worked through a lot of it before purchasing this book.  The number of pages copied verbatim from one book to the other appears to be significant, particularly at the beginning.  I could not help feeling a little like I paid twice for the same not inexpensive book.  However, the material unique to this book is great, especially the chapters on reharmonization.  Just don't be surprised if you own the Jazz Piano book and end up skipping some sections in this book.
B000E5KUK6|5.0|I read the other reviews of this film and laugh. Some people just don't like anything!  Great effort in making this godzilla fun because it was. I bet those people who rated this 1 star would be happier being just locked up in a closet. You can never have enough godzilla movies and the more movie studios make the better. and why not make godzilla look different?  do you really want 20 movies with him looking exactly the same? those are the same people who still wear bell bottoms and have mullets! fun fun fun godzilla movie!!!  make more and change him again just to piss off the prissies!!
B000007WNN|5.0|I truly enjoyed the album.  A must have to your Cult collection.
B000ION23K|4.0|Some might complain that the lead wasn't likeable because he started out as a bitter kid who picked on ants, but I thought the pecking order shown in the beginning where Lucas did unto ants (and less obviously, his mum) as the bully did unto him was true to human, especially kid, nature. Maybe I'm a bad person but I recall that when the most popular kids teased me when I was younger, I'd take it out on kids who had even fewer friends than me. Teaming up with those kids and standing up to my original bullies might've been more productive, but my excuse is that this movie didn't exist to teach me that. Speaking of the message, I thought the lowbrow humour offset some of the preach factor that the message could've brought about. With jokes like that I didn't feel like it was written by a teacher, or at least not by a stuffy teacher but by the fun teacher who made gross jokes to win me over, then once he earned my attention, taught me something.
B000H7JCG4|2.0|As a teenager I loved this show.  Now that I am in my 30's I still love the show but.....the DVD release of Season One is just horrible !! <br />They couldn't get the rights to the original music so they replaced it with some really lame punk/rock/elevator music.  I hate it.  The show isn't the same without the original music.   <br />If I would have known that all the episodes had the music changed I would have never purchased the DVD. <br />I am very dissapointed and I hope the studio re-releases it with the ORIGINAL music.
B000HD1AEA|5.0|I wasn't a Sarah fan in 1999 when the \\"Mirrorball\\" tour came through my backyard, where \\"Mirrorball\\" was recorded live, at Portland Oregon's Rose Garden.  But I had become a fan, and was at her show, when she came through with the \\"AfterGlow\\" tour.  By the time \\"AfterGlow\\" was out, I had just discovered the original Mirrorball CD and DVD, and up until the release of this 2-CD set, the original \\"Mirrorball\\" live CD and DVD were my \\"most played\\" CD and DVD of my whole 700+ various artist collection.  But even before finishing the first CD of this 2 CD set, I know that I had to have another copy for the car.  Sarah Fan?  You must buy this now.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  It is the full show, with all of her interactions with the crowd, and the sound is better than either of the previously released Mirrorball CD and DVD titles.  I love live music, and this set is a dream come true.  Sarah is a true performer \\"live\\", and I think is actually at her best when performing \\"live\\".  Absolutely amazing recording and performance on this newly released 2-CD Full Concert Live set.  And if you get a chance to see her perform, pay whatever it costs to see her show.
B000I5X824|5.0|If you are truly a Staind fan, this is a must have.  Staind has put together 16 awesome tracks from all 5 albums.  They've also picked some great live accoustics.  I can definetely say that the way they performed Confortably Numb, was great, and I'm sure Pink Floyd would agree.
B00029LNHS|4.0|Black Eyed Peas is a group either people get or don't get.  I fit into both categories.  I enjoyed the somewhat overplayed hit single \\"Where Is The Love?\\" but didn't find it engaging enough to purchase the record it was featured on--until I heard their next single \\"Let's Get It Started.\\"  The funk-pop groove sounded excellent and I decided to get Elephunk.  Highlights are the aforementioned two hit singles, \\"Hey Mama\\" and \\"Shut Up.\\"  The remainder is decent fluff but nothing that lives up to those four likable singles.  Unfortunately the oft-odd personalities of each of the Peas' members are so awkward it's hard to like the band as much as the songs themselves.  Still, it's a decent album that has some good grooves--but far from perfect.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road has been my favorite album since I was 3 years old and I want to hear side 2 cranked up when I'm on my deathbed, yes even if I am in a home. Because was easily the most underrated Beatles song ever (Dear Prudence ranks up there too) and its too bad they couldn't get it on a single since there's no way it wouldn't have charted. Anyway, Abbey Road rules forever!
B000J103X4|5.0|West Coast Rap at its finest. All production issues, label disputes, and personal beefs are irrelevant (I'm a 50 fan/Dre fanatic). This album is straight fire (the best this year so far). Game the young 'G' goin' hard on the mic (the \\"name drop\\" is part of his lyrical style) over immaculate/top-notch production (also the best this year so far). What more could a true Gansta Rap aficionado ask for. If you know, understand, recognize, and feel real Hip Hop/Rap music, BUY THIS ALBUM! It's that good.
B00005JPAO|5.0|The British royal family has weathered abdications, wars, and scandal. But one of the nastiest hits to them in the twentieth century came when Princess Di was killed.<br /><br />And so \\"The Queen\\" tries to get inside the perfectly-permed head of the British Queen Elizabeth II, nearly ten years ago. Helen Mirren gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the title character, as she attempts to weather public and personal difficulties. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.<br /><br />The movie opens with the election of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), who comes to visit the queen (Mirren), despite being rather nervous about his new job. The country has been off balance ever since Di died in a car crash a few weeks ago, and her passing leaves the royals with mixed feelings. The queen decrees that since Diana divorced Prince Charles, she was no longer a royal, and her arrangements are to be left to her family.<br /><br />What she doesn't realize is that the people ADORED Diana, and continue to adore her in the weeks that follow. Then the press joins in, berating the royal family for coldly ignoring the ex-princess, and heralding the Labour Party Blair. Her husband and mother think that she should continue doing nothing -- but the Queen has learned that sometimes the people need to be appeased.<br /><br />\\"The Queen\\" unfolds slowly like an old book, and Stephen Frears gives it the dignified gloss that usually belongs to older movies. Scenes that could have been maudlin or cliche are underplayed, which makes them more powerful. One example is of the queen peering in as Charles tells his young sons that their mother has died.<br /><br />Fortunately, as in real life, there's also comedy as well as confusion and tragedy; Peter Morgan injects some humor when a nervy Blair meets the Queen for the first time. Morgan also spins u[ the kind of dialogue we can imagine the droll Elizabeth or prickly Prince Philip saying (\\"Sleeping in the streets and pulling out their hair for someone they never knew. And they think WE'RE mad!\\").<br /><br />Mirren doesn't normally look much like Elizabeth II. She's younger, taller, and prettier. But with some padding and makeup, she manages to BECOME Elizabeth II. She's dignified, haughty, yet Mirren manages to bring across that she's bewildered and vulnerable as well. In short, she makes her version of Elizabeth II a person.<br /><br />She's also backed by magnificent performances by Sheen and James Cromwell. Cromwell is excellent as the crotchety, stubborn Prince Philip, who thinks the best way to deal with grief is to go hunting. And Sheen is very good as the Prime Minister who is just starting his work, and who gains a new perspective on the royals.<br /><br />\\"The Queen\\" is a unique, quietly compelling film, as it explores what might have happened within the royal family -- and the person that Queen Elizabeth might be, underneath the royal mask.never knew.

B0002DB0FO|5.0|Everwood dealt with everyday situations that actually happen to families, <br />unlike a lot of the other shows that are on the air.

B000CNDIZE|5.0|This album is incredible. Let me expand. I, like many others in the U.S., was introduced to Sia by her single \\"Breathe Me\\" which blew me away and basically obligated me to buy this album right away. While Breathe Me is still my favorite song on the album, every song on this album is so good that I've been listening to it over and over again every day for months, and with the size of my library, that's extremely rare.<br /><br />I've enjoyed her contributions on the Zero 7 albums for a long time, and I recently bought her debut solo effort \\"Healing is Difficult,\\" but both of these projects differ from each other and sound much different than Colour. Her first album is much more beat-oriented, with infusions of R&B and a little jazz influence. Overall, the songs are musically sound and catchy, but her voice does not really get a chance to shine. Her work on Zero 7 accomplishes this better, and comes closer to the sound on Colour, but because it was primarily the work of the other two band members, it wasn't her own work and thus was not a proper representation of her talent.<br /><br />Colour the Small One is a towering achievement, and deserves attention as one of the best albums to be released of late. Sia's voice is almost surreal in its beauty and range--sometimes a light, airy, but melancholy and seemingly effortless expression, other times a piercing, forceful, fluctuating unique sound that seems to serve a cathartic purpose, and certainly demands attention. It's difficult to describe the overall sound of the album, but perhaps a discussion of the instrumentation will be enlightening: there is an electronic component to the album, but it's by no means a dance album, and fits more into a chill category. The use of acoustic guitar is right on: the music isn't centered on it, but is beautifully accompanied by it. Piano provides a similar backing. Orchestral bits (cello, flute, etc.) only contribute to the overall feel and beauty of the album. Each song sounds different but they all seem to fit so well together. Many of the songs are composed of slower verses, and drawn out and repetitive choruses, but this is not a negative thing, because Sia's voice is all you want to hear, and it really shines in this album.<br /><br />I don't really know who to compare her to, because her sound is so unique, but Tori Amos, Feist, a little Rachael Yamagata, and of course Zero 7 come to mind. Everyone of my friends who have heard any of her music immediately ask who it is and love her immediately. Needless to say, I highly recommend this album. It is both sad and refreshingly hopeful at the same time. Breathe Me still blows me away every time I hear it, and I cannot stop listening to the other songs such as Don't Bring Me Down, Moon, The Church of What's Happening Now, and Numb....I also saw her live a few nights ago, and while I wasn't sure what to expect, again I was blown away. Never have I seen an artist have so much fun on stage, but also so in the zone while singing. That supports her talent: Sia is incredible in her songwriting and her execution. The lyrics are deep and meaningful, not superficial poppy stuff, and her execution is of the utmost maturity. You will love this album, it's too varied to be categorized, and too beautiful not to appreciate.all seem to fit so well together.

B00094OB1Q|5.0|Many people say that the best Fidelio in the market is the one recorded by Klemperer on EMI with Christa Ludwig and Jon Vickers.  While I would say that that is a great recording, I think listeners would find a better Fidelio in this recording by Karl Böhm made in 1969 with Gwyneth Jones, James King, Franz Crass, Martti Talvela, and Edith Mathis.  First of all, I believe that Böhm was in every way a great conductor, much better than many of the big names who made their careers skyrocket by recording constantly with many of the big labels.  In this Fidelio, his conducting is animated and full of life. Beethoven's score sings and dances and moves with life, unlike Klemperer's heavy-handed conducting.  Böhm was in many ways an ideal interpreter of the German repertoire, and one can see why he was such a favorite in the opera house.  His Wagner is probably the best conducted on records, along with his definitive Strauss, Mozart, Bruckner, Haydn, Brahms, and Beethoven.  If any conductor can boast having had the most lively interpretations throughout his long and fascinating career, it would probably be Karl Böhm.  I, as a fan of Herbert von Karajan, would even say that most of Böhm's recordings surpass his Austrian colleague's.  His orchestra in this recording, the Dresden Staatskapelle, plays with clarity, transparity, and sensitivity with a Romantic sound rarely found in a lot of German orchestras.  For conducting alone would I give this recording five stars. <br /> <br />The cast is exemplary too.  The Fidelio/Leonore here is sung by Gwyneth Jones, who is in my opinion the greatest dramatic soprano of the century.  Her voice has none of the wide vibrato that would make critics shy away from some of her latter performances, and her interpretation is caught here at its her most intelligent and sensitive best.  I find that her Leonore is infinitely more touching than Christa Ludwig's (and definitely more powerful!) and all other sopranos who have touched the role.Her spoken dialogues are done with perfect German, and her interpretation is feminine and touching.  A definitive performance!  Her Florestan is played by James King, whose voice is simply beautiful.  Although his interpretation doesn't have the psychological probing qualities of James King's Florestan, his interpretation is more natural than the Canadian tenor's, and his voice, like I said, is darker and more beautiful than Jon's.  Edith Mathis is a reference Marzelline for the beauty of tone and lightness and spontaneity of her voice, while Franz Crass makes a most compelling Rocco.  Theo Adam is dramatically right as the villain Don Pizzaro, while Martti Talvela is perhaps the greatest Don Fernando on disc.  This is the best recording of Fidelio, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to understand Beethoven's work in its most truthful and theatrical form.
B000I5X824|5.0|This CD is perfect for any Staind fan as well as anyone that just likes great music.

B000HEWEEY|3.0|I would have given this Ultimate Collector's Edition 5 stars, but I can't because of the glaring omission of any commentaries.   <br /> <br />I just don't get it.  If they can round up the principal cast members such as Leslie Nielsen, Anne Francis, Earl Holliman, Richard Anderson, and Warren Stevens in addition to all the film's famous historian fans like Joe Dante, Alan Dean Foster, and Bill Warren for the documentaries; why couldn't they have used these same people to create at least one commentary track?   <br /> <br />One of the great things about my War of The Worlds Special Collectors Edition disc is the commentaries from Joe Dante and Bill Warren and Gene Barry and Anne Robinson.  I love all the film trivia and cultural aspects they bring up on these tracks.  I was hoping I'd get the same from Forbidden Planet: UCE. <br /> <br />As the documentary on disc 2 states, this is THE science fiction film of all time and the one that started it all; providing  the inspirations for Star Trek and Star Wars.  Yet, Warner Brothers chose to neglect including a feature that most would consider mandatory for a so -called \\"Ultimate Edition\\" for the film's fans.  What a let down! <br />

B00009Y3L4|5.0|+++++<br /><br />This movie is based on the musical play \\"Cabaret\\" (also called \\"Goodbye Berlin\\").  The music and lyrics are by the great John Kander and Fred Ebb respectively.  It was directed by, and the dance & musical numbers were staged by, the late, great Bob Fosse.<br /><br />Personally, I'm not much for musicals but this movie is much more than a terrific musical.  Don't get the idea that there's just singing and dancing.  There's also a good story that delves into the corruption, decadence, and false dreams of Berlin in the early 1930s when Hitler was coming to power.<br /><br />The story follows the life of Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) during this turbulent time.  She is the so-called star of the Kit Kat nightclub that has an impish master of ceremonies (Joel Grey).  Writer Brian Roberts (Michael York) intrudes in Sally's world, hoping to take the vacant room opposite hers.  He soon learns that she is a ball of fire and energy.<br /><br />Sally tells us of her dream:<br /><br />\\"I'm going to be a great film star.  That is, if booze and sex don't get me first.\\"<br /><br />The movie alternates between the real, difficult life outside the Kit Kat nightclub and the carefree life inside it where those who attend can forget their troubles and the troubled times.<br /><br />The song and dance routines inside the Kit Kat Klub provide a sharp counterpoint to the real-life drama on the outside.  Five songs from the original Broadway production did not make it into the movie as \\"performed\\" songs, but appear as background music.<br /><br />The music, costumes, choreography, and acting are all exquisite.  Especially impressive is the performance of Minnelli, awesome on the stage and equally convincing off it.  Matching her is the fascinating performance of Grey as the Master of Ceremonies who injects humor and pathos as well as effervescence and solidity into the proceedings.<br /><br />The last song and dance scene performed by Minnelli is historic and unforgettable!<br /><br />This movie won eight Academy Awards including best actress (Minnelli), best supporting actor (Grey), and best director (Fosse).<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2003) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has a long list of interesting extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would recommend that you go to this cabaret (old chum).  You'll never want to leave!!<br /><br />(1972;  2 hrs;  wide screen;  32 scenes)<br /><br />+++++br /><br />This movie won eight Academy Awards including best actress (Minnelli), best supporting actor (Grey), and best director (Fosse).<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2003) is perfect in picture and sound quality.

B000J103X4|5.0|I PERSONALLY DIDN'T LIKE THE GAME WHEN HE FIRST CAME OUT WITH 50 ON HIS SONGS BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT 50 CRAMPED HIS STYLE(WEST COAST). AFTER HEARING SEVERAL MIXTAPES CDS FROM GAME, HE HAS PROVEN TO ME THAT HE IS REALLY BRING THE WEST COAST BACK. I'M CONVINCED! I GREW UP ON C-BO, CELLY-CEL,E-40,SPICE-1,BIG SNOOP DOG, DR. D.R.E, EAZY-E, AND BROTHA LYNCH AND HE BELONGS HERE WITH THESE ARTIST WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE WEST COAST. I DIDN'T LISTEN TO THE DOCUMENTARY BUT THE DR. ADVOCATE GOES HARD AND REPRESENT EVERYTHING ABOUT L.A AND CALI. AND EVERYHOOD,EVERY CORNER,EVERY BLOCK, AND EVERY CITY. ALMOST EVERY SONG ON THIS CD IS A TIGHT AND THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT VIBES. THIS IS PRETTY DAMN GOOD FOR PRODUCING HIS FIRST ALBUM BY HIMSELF. WHAT I LIKE THE MOST ABOUT THIS ALBUM IS THAT AFTER ALL THE BS WITH 50 ANAD G-UNIT, HE SHOWED THAT HE IS A REAL MAN AND SAID THAT HE AINT GOT BEEF WITH THEM NO MORE AND ACTUALLY APOLIGIZED TO DRE ABOUT NOT SQUASHING THE BEEF EARLIER. NONETHELESS, HE HAS PROVEN THAT HE DOESN'T NEED EMINEM OR DRE TO MAKE A PLATNIUM ALBUM UNLIKE 50 CENT AND G-UNIT. I THINK THEIR CAREERS HAVE CAP-SIZED SINCE THE GAME HAS LEFT G-UNIT AND THEY REALLY DO NOT HAVE ANYONE TALENTED ENOUGH ON THE LABEL THAT COULD HANG WITH THE GAME FREESTYLING OR RAPPING BESIDE EMINEM. TO SUM THIS UP, 97% OF THE SONGS ON THIS ARE BANGIN AND THE OTHER 3% ARE OKAY. THAT 3% I HAVE NOT LISTEN TO THE REST OF THE CDS YET.
B00005RDRO|5.0|This is one of the funniest \\"who dun its\\" I have ever watched.  The puns flow like water, there are lots of laugh out loud scenes, and the casting was excellent.  Although it doesn't have vulgarities, x-rated love scenes, or gallons of blood, and is suitable for children and adults alike, it remains quite a hilarious movie.  Peter Falk, David Niven, Peter Sellers, Alec Guinness, Nancy Walker, James Coco, Eileen Brennan, Maggie Smith, and several others, were great.
B000J103X4|4.0|I was surprised at the quality of this record.  Even without G-Unit or Aftermath behind him, Game can make great music.  I liked the single \\"One Blood\\" a lot, and Game kept the same punchline/shout-out heavy style that made him so popular.  So, this record from jump kept me satisfied.  \\"Lookin At U\\" is a bangin west coast catering concoction that deserves immediate attention.  And actually, the only song on here that I feel isn't as good as the rest (though listenable) is the Kanye West-featured \\"Wouldn't Get Far\\" and it's mostly because the east coast style of the beat doesn't mesh too well with the rest of the record (except the closing number \\"Why You Hate The Game\\" featuring Nas and floetry, but that would've worked regardless).  Surprisingly enough, almost all of these producers are from the aftermath camp or have some affliation with the good doctor (Hi-Tek, Nottz, J.r. Totem, etc. all have worked with Dre in the past and are rumored to have beats on the Detox album) and it shows.  The production value and quality control is worth of Dre and Fifty (well, Fifty's kinda fallen off lately anyway, and I hope they're both kicking themselves after hearing this record and how ridiculously dope it is), and I hope that people hear how much Game's stepped up his flow and lyrics on this record.  Even the sellout Will.I.Am contributes an old school flavored west coast 'gangsta boogie' with \\"Compton\\".  This record is dope from front to back and I would give it 5 stars but the song that leaked that was produced by Dre (eat that, Fifty!) couldn't get cleared for the record.  Game on...
1574241451|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Adrian's view of the history of the 335 and its variants.  Having grown up in the \\"335 era\\" and selling guitars for a time, I related to many of the historic factors highlighted in the book that impacted the success of this wonderful instrument.  I also learned a lot about one of my favorite guitars in this too-brief history. I wish there had been more attention given to some of the smaller technical details of various years and changes, along with even more pictures (both B&W and color), as well as set-up details and recommendations that were not included.  However what I did find in this book was very informative and useful in helping me correctly restore my own 60's ES-355TDC.  I also would have liked to have seen more interviews with famous 335 players.  But, as the only source of focused info on the 335 series that I know of, this is a \\"must-have\\" reference.  Thanks for filling this void Adrian! <br />
B00005JPCA|2.0|I gave this movie 2 stars for the first 10 minutes of this movie-it was in true James Bond style-great action on the edge of your seat!  Then it took a severe nosedive. It was more of a romance story than a action-adventure movie. The card playing was dragged out and boring(I enjoy watching Bravo's Celebrity Poker more!) The only action was just watching Bond run around....alot. The car chasing just involved James Bond following another car down a road for about a minute with no fancy car moves and action.  I didn't care if any of the characters lived or died including Bond!
B000H5V8DG|5.0|This series is excellent and worth watching over and over just like one would watch 24, The Soprano's, Desperate Housewives or any AWARD WINNING HIT TV SHOW LIKE ALIAS!!!  Yes, the story line was rushed in the final season. The writers changed and one could witness the difference in sticking to the story line of Rambaldi and how the LOST series obviously interfered with \\"Alias\\" being the focus of J.J.Abrams who also directed Mission Impossible 3... The man is downright GENIUS. <br /> <br />  This story is about Sydney Bristow and her family who are not who they seem to be.  Twists and turns create doubts in Sydney's life which is what tempted her to risk her life for every mission while leading a \\"normal\\" life in deep undercover. As we learned about Sydney we also learned about her family and the ties she had to a certain Rambaldi Profacy.  This Rambaldi Profacy revealed itself through series of clues \\"Artifacts\\" which were a huge background to the story.  Many villians came and went but Most of us Loved the Evil Ways of re-occurring villans Arvin Sloane, Irina Derevko, Anna Espinosa, the Infamous Mr. Sark and others who are all in the quest of achieving the Rambaldi EndGame. This Series is excellent and the fact the set is encased in a Rambaldi Artifact, comes with a Special Disc and comes with a Book with answers We Have All Been Waiting For!!!! <br /> <br />Critics may trash the last two seasons but I can tell you that was due to the scheduling and changing days and times are huge (viewers are not sure when to watch) the Desperate Housewives time slot on Sunday nights at 9p.m. was the time slot Alias had for over 3 1/2 years and then we were lucky to see a consecutive episode on a weekly basis.  Quite a shame I might say because personally Desperate Housewives is a trashy soap opera and Alias should have been a serious focus to ABC, there is enough sex, lies and phony acting out there...Alias was a family show, fans related with the Characters, the acting is incredible!!  I miss every week watching a spy family show with drama, storyline, mystery and makes anyone who watches the series incredibly unfulfilled because of the short time the network gave Alias to wrap up the plotline.  Its like watching ER and getting attached to the characters they finally reach the end, your sad it ends.  DOES IT ??????  THIS IS THE WORLD OF ALIAS!!!!! HUMMMMM I DONT THINK SO....HAHAHA

B000K7VHPU|5.0|What a wonderful movie. The best I've seen in a long time. The acting was fabulous, the love story tender, and the ending unbelievably clever. I also found the music to be beautiful and perfect for the mood of the movie.
B00005JPCA|5.0|\\"Casino Royale\\" is brilliant! Daniel Craig is one of the best Bonds since Sean Connery. The directing by Martin Campbell (who, ironically directed Pierce Brosnan in his first run as Bond in \\"Goldeneye\\" (1995) is excellent! The screenplay, which is based on Ian Fleming's novel, from Neal Purvis, Robert Wade (both who wrote the screenplays to Bond films such as \\"Die Another Day\\" (2002) & \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" (1999) and both are working on another Bond film starring Craig), and Paul Haggis (who won the Oscar for his work on \\"Crash\\" (2005), and he also recently did \\"Flags Of Our Fathers\\" (2006) is brilliant! The music by David Arnold (who has been doing the score to the Bond films since \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" (1997) is brilliant! The cinematography by Phil Meheux (who has worked with Campbell on \\"The Legend Of Zorro\\" (2005), \\"Beyond Borders\\" (2003), \\"The Mask Of Zorro\\" (1998), \\"Goldeneye\\", \\"No Escape\\" (1994), \\"Defenseless\\" (1991), & \\"Criminal Law\\" (1988) is brilliant! The film editing by Stuart Baird (who recently film edited Campbell's \\"The Legend Of Zorro\\") is excellent. The casting by Stéphane Foenkinos & Debbie McWilliams (who has done the casting for Bond films since \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" (1981) is excellent! The production design by Peter Lamont (who was nominated for an Oscar for his work as an art director on \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\" (1977) & 20 years later, won the Oscar for his work on \\"Titanic\\" (1997), he has been working on Bond films since \\"Thunderball\\" (1965) is brilliant! The art direction by Peter Francis (who was one of the art directors on \\"Batman Begins\\" (2005), James Hambidge (who was one of the art directors on \\"Die Another Day\\"), Steven Lawrence (who was one of the art directors on \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" & \\"Batman Begins\\"), & Dominic Masters (who was also, along with Lawrence & Francis, one of the art directors on \\"Batman Begins\\") is brilliant! The set decoration by Simon Wakefield (who has worked on Bond films since \\"The World Is Not Enough\\")is brilliant! The costume design by Lindy Hemming (who is working on the upcoming \\"Bond 22\\" (2008) & \\"The Dark Knight\\" (2008), also won an Oscar for her work on \\"Topsy-Turvy\\" (1999), she has also worked on \\"Batman Begins\\", \\"Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life\\" (2003), \\"Die Another Day\\", \\"Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets\\" (2002), \\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\" (2001), \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\", \\"Blood And Wine\\" (1996), & \\"Goldeneye\\") is brilliant! This is the best Bond film I have seen since the days of Sean Connery and this is one of the year's best! This is an brilliant, emotionally-charged action-packed thriller that keeps you entertained and wanting more. Yes, it is overlong, but, to me, I don't really care, once you get caught up in the movie. This is an action film to see again and again, as many times as you want.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|HELL YEAH!!! Excellent album!! Powerful, emotion filled vocals with awesome melodies to boot.

B000GW87PC|5.0|The Bends could it be considered as one of the most fantastic works of Radiohead as Ok Computer is through the time. Indeed I like this one, because this version features two more tracks, I'm very satisfied with this version. This Japanese version looks great.
B00005NB8K|5.0|As a huge Morrison fan, I have to give Oliver Stone credit for being one the major influences. This isn't supposed to portray The Doors accurately-it's Hollywood, not a documentary. It's merely one person's vision with theatrics thrown in for good measure. That being said, if you love absolute and utter chaos (as I do) in rock and roll format, this is a must-see.
B00006I53S|5.0|Had looked at this lens both at the camera shop and on line and finally decided after much comparison with other lenses to finally purchase it, have'nt regretted it one bit. This lens is clear with excellent color, saturation and sharpness without any or minimal post processing. Coupled with an external flash it's great indoors as well. Have been using it as my everyday walk around lens. Zoom range is excellent(Rebel XT/XTi 1.6 magnification). Though it's somewhat on the big side, it won't tire you out carrying it around your neck. Purchased the hood seperately which, for the money should have came with the lens.  <br />Anyway, this lens offers excellent value for the money and you won't regret the investment.
0743298020|3.0|THE THIRTEENTH TALE has been heavily hyped, and is probably the biggest debut of the year in terms of sales.  I thought it was extremely well written, but I was never fully drawn into it.<br /><br />This novel is written in a rather old-fashioned style, like the novels of the nineteenth century.  In fact, it is unclear what time period this novel takes place in.  There are no computers, cell phones, or modern conveniences.  We do not even know the age of the narrator, who seems to completely lack any sort of personal life.<br /><br />This novel is leisurely paced.  It begins strongly, but it really sags in the middle.  I found the storyline to be pretty slow going in spots.  There were many times when I put it down.  THE THIRTEENTH TALE does have a major twist near the end, which you are either going to love or hate.  Either way, the twist changes the entire nature of what you've read before.  In the end, this is a rather devious book in many ways.  The reader may resent being tricked.<br /><br />My major problem with this book is with the characters.  They are never fully fleshed out.  Nearly all of them are eccentric in one form or another.  The narrator is a book lover, which I can relate to, but she is a rather lifeless character who is difficult to like.  Many of the supporting characters are somewhat two-dimensional and annoying.  I failed to identify with any of them.<br /><br />As a result, I found it difficult to root for anybody in this novel.  There are some tragic things that happen in this book, but I never felt much empathy for the victims.  This is a clever book in many ways, but I was never emotionally engaged with the story.<br /><br />Overall, though, I enjoyed this book on an intellectual level, because of the high quality of the prose. Setterfield's writing is definitely first-rate.  I would not recommend this book, however, to people who put a high premium on fast-placed plots and vivid, likable characters.
B00005JPAJ|1.0|\\"Babel\\" was one of the most unpleasant experiences I've had at the movies. I don't mean to say that it was appropriately or effectively unpleasant; what I do mean to say is that I wish I had not seen it. It was a low attempt as a cultural commentary, failing to instill even the slightest amount of understanding, compassion, or tolerance. What exactly was director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu hoping to achieve here? If it was to inform the audience, to show that miscommunication can lead to a series of ill-timed and heartbreaking events, then he went about it the wrong way. This film only manages to depress us by depicting people in unfortunate circumstances, and not in a way that's fascinating, enlightening, or even entertaining. It's too long, too slow, and far too downbeat to do any good for an audience, especially if a resolution is desired.    What we have here is a fragmented story of distant connections, told in four separate yet mixed segments. They're so distant that one wonders why they had to be connected in the first place; one idea is incredibly different from the other, pretty much to the point of seeming out of place when forced together in the same plot. Apparently, it wasn't bad enough that each segment was unbearably drawn out, with little dialogue passing between the characters. As the story progresses, its one bad situation after another, and by the end, little if anything has been a worthwhile experience. Yes, I understood that we were supposed to be witnessing several slices of life, and yes, I recognize that it was made to be \\"realistic.\\" But shouldn't such \\"realism\\" actually go somewhere? Was there really no other way to make the plight of these characters understandable and worthy of our sympathy?    I think the best way to describe the plot would be to separate the four segments (I can't describe them in any particular order, considering they unevenly weave together). The first segment involves a poor Moroccan family. The father, Abdulah (Mustapha Rachidi), purchases a pre-owned rifle and gives it to his two adolescent sons, Yussef (Boubker Ait El Caid) and Ahmed (Said Tarchani). One day while atop a mountain, practicing shooting at jackals and rocks, they decide to fire at a passing tour bus in the distance (not out of hatred; they just wanted to test the rifle's firing range). They see the bus come to a stop and immediately understand that someone has been hurt. As all frightened children would do, they run off. They immediately hide the rifle and keep silent about the whole thing, even when they hear the news that an American woman was shot (and supposedly killed).    The second segment involves Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett), an American couple visiting Morocco, supposedly to reconnect after their infant son died of SIDS. It doesn't seem to be working; it was easy to recognize the tension between them, as was the fact that Susan is deeply hurt over Richard's initial inability to deal with the death. Reconciliation is hinted at on their tour bus, when she reaches for his hand. But then things take a turn for the worst when a rogue bullet hits her square in the neck. Thus begins a whirlwind decent into panic and fear; the nearest hospital is over four hours away, and no one will stop to help. The only option is for Susan to be taken to the nearest village and housed in a Good Samaritan's home. While she rests, Richard tries like mad to get hold of the American embassy. He thinks that if anyone can get an ambulance to his injured wife, they can.    The third segment involves a Mexican housekeeper named Amelia (Adriana Barraza), who diligently looks after Richard and Susan's surviving children, Debbie (Elle Fanning) and Mike (Nathan Gamble). Amelia had planned on returning home to Mexico for her son's wedding, but Richard tells her that she has to stay with his children a little longer. Unable to find anyone to watch them, she foolishly decides to take them with her. She meets with her nephew, Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal), and they all cross the border. Initially, everything goes well: the kids have fun (mostly), the wedding was lively and eventful, and everyone came away happy. But driving back into America turns into a nightmare. When the Boarder Patrol demands Santiago to pull over under suspicion of intoxication, he speeds away. He then tells Amelia and the kids to get out of the car. Now there was a bright idea: leaving two innocent children and his aunt alone in the desolate California desert, in the middle of the night, with no food or water. Did he ever intend to find them again? Apparently not: come daybreak, they're left to fend for themselves.    The forth segment was, in my opinion, the worst of all in terms of relevance. It involves a girl named Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi), a deaf and mute Japanese teenager who's still reeling over the suicide of her mother. She's become downright standoffish to her father, Yasujiro (Koji Yakusho), whose emotional distance is giving her reason to rebel. She's so desperate for male attention that she's willing to sacrifice her dignity. She exposes her genitals to a group of teenage boys. She tries to get her dentist to manually stimulate her. She even strips completely naked for a detective. Why, you ask, was the detective there in the first place? He wanted to question her father over an international incident, specifically the shooting of an American woman in Morocco. Yasujiro was recently on a hunting excursion in that country, and he gave his rifle to his guide as a form of payment.    All four of these segments are dismal, practically bordering on melodrama. This is shown through some unnecessary plot details: one of Abdulah's sons is sexually attracted to his sister; Richard gets into fights with other tour bus passengers; an affair between Amelia and an old flame is hinted at (but not followed through); Chieko goes to a dance club only to remember that she can't hear any of the music. Why did any ofthis need to be included? What do they have to do with the underlying story of the rifle? Everything was so disjointed and off kilter that I felt none of the segments belonged together; they probably would have been much better as separate films (without the rifle subplot, of course). Maybe that's why each moment of dialogue felt half complete, as if I had entered halfway through the conversation.     But that's only the start of this film's problems, not the least of which is its intolerable pacing. To say that it moves at a snail's pace would be an understatement. To say that its speed hurts an already unlikable story would be too kind. I only had ugly feelings watching this movie, a movie founded on an idea that would never support such ugliness. \\"Babel\\" was awful, pure and simple. It was as confused and unintelligible as the men who tried to build a tower to Heaven.
B00006JLX4|3.0|I'm not sure how retroactively Pavement's status as definitive indie rock band of the 90s has been awarded but it seems like they became a much bigger deal after they broke up than they ever were when they were together. This debut album could hold it's own against the albums Unrest and Sebadoh released around the same time, but Dinosaur Jr, Yo La Tengo, Buffalo Tom, Sonic Youth, Swervedriver, Superchunk and Archers Of Loaf were making similar more substancial albums. This could be a worthwhile doucment of how ramshackle indie rock can get while still being tuneful some of the time, but it's not a genre landmark or a satisfying listen from start to finish which most fans even seem to admit.

They don't try to resurrect past successes, leading to a couple of uninspired songs, but their playing and production is getting better. There are no immediate hits, save for first single \\"I Am Mine\\". The rockers are very good, most notably \\"Save You\\", which has a great opening riff. The ballads are in full-force here, on the tender \\"Love Boat Captain\\" and heavy-hearted \\"Thumbing My Way\\".
1416909532|5.0|It's true that this book isn't exactly groundbreaking, there's nothing in here that you didn't already know but putting all the \\"signs\\" into one concise book that you can read in an hour or two really makes you think. I'd read it if there's a guy you're not sure about or who always has the best reason in the world for letting you down or not being the kind of guy you want for yourself. Sometimes you just need to hear the truth from someone else - and Behrendt is better than most to tell you. <br /> <br />It's good for a giggle or two aswell, if only at yourself for believing some of the lines people have given you in the past!
078628952X|5.0|I would highly recommend Omnivore's Dilemma by Michael Pollan. The book is about modern \\"industial agricultural\\" which includes processing and animal raising. <br />There were several things I learned from this author, which looking at the extensive bibliography, may be close to the truth. <br />  <br />I learned that \\"cage free\\" eggs at the local supermarket probably are little more than a marketing tool and hardly worth the $2 extra per dozen. Pollan points out that language in USDA regulations, insisted on by giant corporations, merely calls for animals to \\"have access\\" to pasture etc. He observed a 20,000 hen house with a little door at one end and no chickens exiting. Technically they qualify as \\"free range\\". I did find some Omega-3 eggs at Trader Joe's for $1.99 that claimed their feed included flaxseed but no antibiotics, animal proteins, steroids or harmones. The yolks are much darker than the alleged \\"free range\\" eggs. The latter appear no different than supermarket \\"industrial\\" produced eggs. My little experiment tends to confirm Pollan. <br />  <br />I learned that you might want to pay up to get grass fed beef rather than feedlot beef, that are force fed a diet of corn, hormones and antibiotics. The antibiotics are necessary because the animals sleep in the own feces. Additionally cattle are herbivores and evolved to eat grass not corn. Corn lowers the pH of  a cow's stomach acid from 7.0 to 2.0. This quite acidic and unnatural environment in the herbivore's rumen has bred a new Ecoli bacteria which is resistant to the formerly anticeptic effect of our own stomach acid. Thus we now can get quite sick from eating hamburger which isn't well done. <br />  <br />I learned that our  agriculture has been industrialized and become quite dependent on cheap energy from natural gas and other fossil fuels. Thus high energy prices might provide a shock to the system in the not too distant future.  <br />  <br />There are many more peices of information in the book and the author's style of writing bundles the information up in easily digestable bites.  <br />
B000H6SXLU|4.0|I dont know where this famous saying saying started, but this movie gets my vote for having the word \\"SWELL\\" spoken in it more times than any other movie. I think I counted at least 12 times or more, I'm not sure, it was so much fun counting them I almost couldn't  believe it! I think I missed a few cause I started counting a wee bit into the movie before I caught on and began counting! i.e. \\"Oh! He's/She's really SWELL etc . . . And Randolph Scott - WOOF! At 6'2 his size and football Physique is impressive. Watch the parts when he's standing next to Fred Astaire. Despite his size he is surprisingly agile.<br /><br />Thank God women and we gay men can ogle him AND some of the best 30's fashions all in one movie.<br /><br />In any case it's a different way to watch a movie. And oh! yes, Irene Dunn. Her Thin/Shrill soprano voice in Smoke Gets In Your Eyes was INSUFFERABLE - Sorry. I could hardly wait for her to get over herself. OK, OK she was alright for the first two minutes of the song - but pleeeeease drop it a Key or two!
1597771120|5.0|This is the intense, profound, almost unbearably sad story of Swede Levov, brought to life in the audio version by a mind-blowing performance by Ron Silver.      The Swede was the hero of narrator Nathan Zuckerman's youth, the \\"household Apollo of the Weequahic [New Jersey] Jews.\\"  The Swede's blond good looks and athletic prowess became \\"the repository of all their hopes\\" -- and allowed the neighborhood to forget the war.      To Zuckerman, the Swede had been the embodiment of the hero of his favorite childhood book, \\"The Kid From Tomkinsville.\\"  The Kid was a star ball player, a \\"modest, serious, chaste, loyal, naive, undiscourageable, hard-working, soft-spoken, courageous\\" boy, who, in the final pages of the book, was struck down on the field and carried off inert through the mob on a stretcher.  Zuckerman had secretly viewed this story as an augur of the Swede's own life.  Zuckerman had wondered if it had occurred to the Swede \\"that if disaster could come and strike down the Kid from Tomkinsville, it could come and strike the great Swede down too?\\"    The Swede's mythic power stays with Zuckerman throughout his life.  Forty-five years later, out of the blue, the Swede contacts Zuckerman -- now a renowed writer --  and invites him to dinner, ostensibly to talk about the Swede's father.  Zuckerman accepts the invitation, but is incredibly disappointed in how the Swede has turned out.  Although he still had the face and physique of a God, the Swede seems to be almost unbearably bland -- every word from his mouth is good natured and unobjectionable.      Zuckerman sadly concludes that the Swede has turned out to be \\"the embodiment of nothing,\\" but soon finds out that his assessment of the Swede is wrong.  A few months after the dinner, Zuckerman runs into the Swede's younger brother Jerry at their forty-five-year high school reunion. Jerry reveals that an unbelievable, unthinkable tragedy had befallen the Swede twenty-five years before, and the horror of that eventhad destroyed the Swede's life.      For the rest of the book, Zuckerman explores \\"the brutality of the destruction of this indestructible man.\\"  Zuckerman imagines the Swede's internal life over the course of a half-century.  The Swede's story unfolds in a spiralling structure that goes back and forth through time, as the Swede obsessively tries to make sense of the inexplicable.    Through the Swede's ruminations, Roth explores incredibly weighty themes: a parent's love for a child, the nature of perfection, the randomness of life, the delusion of control and moderation, and the helplessness and hopelessness of trying to figure out why things are. Most of all, Roth seems to struggle with the notion that there cannot be depth without suffering, and that without that depth, life would be meaningless.  You get the feeling that Roth wishes he could appreciate the ordinary guy -- the bland, honorable, decent people who live their lives with relative equilibrium.  Roth seems to regret that it is only the Swede's tragedy that makes him interesting, and that it is only in imagining the Swede's excrutiating pain that Roth can identify with him.    Overall, the book's tone is intense and dark, but there are moments of humor that are funnier than just about anything I've ever read.  Roth's description of the Valentine's gift that the fifteen-year-old Jerry makes for his secret crush had me laughing for days.

Several episodes are on there twice with different titles on the menu.  Who ever put this thing together really didn't do a very good job.  Forget about the music...I want my missing episodes back!!

B00005JPCD|4.0|This movie's animation is incredible and the music is awesome!  Those two things get 5 stars!  I gave the movie an overall of 4 stars only because I couldn't give a 4 1/2 star rating and because I thought the message would likely be lost on kids under about age 6, which is a large part of the target audience. Even if you miss the message, this movie is very entertaining and is about tolerance of others and appreciating their differences, as well as protecting the environment.  At least 1 other reviewer thought this movie had \\"anti-Christian bigotry\\" overtones.  I am a Christian and didn't have a problem with the movie on those grounds.  At the very least, it is a great way to open discussion with your kids about other ways the group might have handled Mumble being different and how that can happen in real life.  As well, it is great for discussing ways that we can all protect our environment and how even the smallest amounts of litter can add up when everyone doesn't do their part to \\"keep it clean!\\"

But hopefully it will give the more sane portion of the population some ammunition to meet the dogmatic rantings of the deists. His writing is sharp, witty, and cuttingly sarcastic, and an easy read, even if you don't agree to all his points. <br />

B000HBKCDC|5.0|Sarah McLachlan's Christmas album, \\"Wintersong.\\"<br /><br />I usually try to hold Christmas at bay until Thanksgiving is over, because I love Christmas and don't like to have it shoved down my throat months before its time.  But this year since I'm DJ-ing at a Christmas party on the 9th, I have to have my playlist ready.  I have a couple hundred Christmas cds; there are a few that I like, mainly by the artists that I like (ie Holly Cole, Alan Jackson, Kenny & Dolly, the Muppets, the Judds, Manhattan Transfer, and the soundtrack to A Charlie Brown Christmas) and I actually have those on my iPod during the season.  But the other ones I just sort of put on and don't really pay close attention to, at least not close enough that when I'm playing live at a party I can use my instinct to know what to play next.  So I've been listening to Christmas cds prematurely.<br /><br />I got the Sarah McLachlan last week, and honestly, I can't stop listening to it.  It's so unbelievable incredible.  It's absolutely stunning.  Her version of Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\" (been covered many times by people such as Holly Cole, Heart, Vonda Shepard) is outstanding.  The original song, which I love, is musically very simple, there's not much to it, it's all about the incredible lyrics.  Playing it on the piano it just lies there, there's only four chords in the whole song, and the song is basically a riff that repeats itself several times.  Sarah has re-constructed the song in a whole new way; she's made it her own.  I don't often say this, but her cover version may be actually better than the original.<br /><br />She's also taken the pretty (but tired) old Christmas carol, \\"What Child Is This? (Greensleeves)\\" and totally made it her own; it's a fascinating, evocative and hauntingly gorgeous version.<br /><br />There's also a couple original songs; normally 'new\\" Christmas songs sound like cheap imitations, but her song, \\"Wintersong\\" is particularly beautiful.  She plays the piano with such grace, something to which I can only aspire.  She also bravely covers John Lennon's \\"Happy Christmas\\" and Gordon Lightfoot's \\"Song for a Winter's Night\\" which was previously released, but is absolutely ethereal (and evocative of Jane Siberry).<br /><br />This album may actually cause some sorrow come January, when Christmas is over and I have to retire the seasonal music.<br /><br />Rod Reynolds<br /><br />Los Angeles  CA USAwith such grace, something to which I can only aspire.

B000CPH9I4|4.0|This is the latest release by the Irish pop sensation 'The Corrs'. This group of 2 sisters, a brother and his partner is the answer to 'U2'. Where U2 does not harp on their Irish beginnings and roots, the Corrs do and with beautiful success. They not only verse in their celtic heritage but embrace it and share it with the world. Andrea Corr, the lead singer has an amazing voice that lifts the lyrics and sweeps the listener on a amazing journey by her voice alone. All I can say is I am continually entranced and enchanted by the beautiful music and tranquil qualities of vocals. This album was created and dedicated to Jean Corr, the dearly departed mother of The Corrs. And what a inspiring compliment this album release is for their mother.<br /><br />It is pleasing to see the Corrs return to native roots, shedding their increasing mainstream pop sound to take in and covet intrinsic Irish melodies and lyrics. I so enjoyed 'Black Is The Colour' & 'Heart Like a Wheel'. The latter song moved me as the lyrics touched my heart in a tender way. The instrumental 'Old Hag' is as Irish as you can get a sound with modern traditional Irish instruments. 'Dimming Of The Day' is a short melodious touching song for those who have hurt in love and felt hurt. 'Haste To the Wedding' and 'Return to Fingall' which are instrumentals are perfect finishing touches to this great album.<br /><br />Any Corrs fan will be delighted by this Irish pop album and Irish listeners will revel in the two Irish lyrical songs. Well worth the purchase to complete the updated compilation from the Corrs. There will be undoubtedly more to come from this talented band of sisters and brother.
B000I5X81K|5.0|THIS CD SHOWS MANY SIDES OF JOSH.  IF YOU LIKED HIS FIRST 2 CD'S, YOU WILL FLIP OVER THIS ONE. WITH MORE \\"ENGLISH\\" SONGS, SOME OF WHICH HE WROTE, IT ONLY MAKES ME WANT TO PLAY IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER.......<br /><br />I NEVER GET TIRED OF LISTENING TO JOSH GROBAN!!!
B00005JPCC|5.0|All kidding aside,Casino Royale is hands down one of the greatest Bond films of all time.Anyone spoiled by gadgets,cheesy quips, and his \\"three women per film\\" quota will be a bit disappointed (even the gun barrel sequence doesn't start off the movie),but Casino Royale makes up for it in giving us the Bond that Ian Fleming creates half a century ago. <br />Daniel Craig would silence anyone on who frowned on his being cast as Bond.He ranks with Connery and Dalton on staying true to the Bond in Fleming's novels.And even the updated screenplay is exceptional for keeping the story grounded, centering on a high stakes poker game to prevent funding of terrorism, as opposed to World Domination which goes all the way back to Dr. No(1962).The main villian LeChiffe isn't a larger than life evil genius with a hallowed out volcano layer, but a banker that funds terrorist activities who must replenish the money he stole, before his clients get to him.Even the main \\"Bond Girl\\" Vespa Lynde (Eva Green) is the most multi faceted since Diana Rigg from On Her Majesties Secret Servive(1969). <br />  Casino Royale is a total reboot of a nearly half century franchise that ranges from great (From Russia With Love,Goldfinger,On Her Majesties Secret Service,The Spy Who Loved Me) to far-fetched (Diamonds Are Forever,Moonraker, The World Is Not Enough),and will take it's righful place in the former category.
B000FIMHJ4|4.0|As others have noted, the remastered sound is really good, and makes the purchase worth it.  The bonus song is fine, but not more.  The \\"world premiere interview\\" is really lame though.  There's nothing \\"premiere\\" about it -- it's just some replay of an interview from the time of the album's release with *a lot* of the album music included under the voices.  I didn't hear anything that wasn't just the usual rock star marketing b.s.  I would have preferred an actual premiere interview, maybe some new commentary from the band or something.  Also, who releases a big remaster without liner notes or recollections or interesting anecdotes?  Poison, apparently.  As I said, if you're a Poison fan, buy this for the sound of the remastered tracks.
B000J10ERO|4.0|Superman Returns is alot like a gift from a fairweather friend.The intentions are good, but the execution is less than desired.After years of getting this project off the ground,Superman Returns marks the Man Of Steel's return after a 19 year big screen absence(as well as various TV shows ie Lois and Clark,Smallville).Bryan Singer wisely decided to pick up where Superman II(1981)left off and bring Superman into the early 21st century where most are still jaded post 9/11 and a hero like Superman seems outmoded and archaic. <br /> After a five year absence seaching for the remains of Krypton,Superman (Brandon Routh) comes back to a different world where even his beloved Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) wins a Pulitzer on \\"Why The World Doesn't Need Superman\\".Meanwhile Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey paying great homage to Gene Hackman) recently paroled and rich, plans his next neferious move. <br /> In Bryan Singer's hands,the movie brings the larger than life Superman to a more \\"human\\" level,as well as pay tribute to the first two Richard Donner pictures starring Christopher Reeve(Donnor's original cut of II will finally be released on DVD).Unfortunately, the film contains alot of plotholes(Lex's kryptonite waterworld,the true nature of Lois Lane's son), miscasting(Bosworth), and a downbeat ending. <br /> Like Singer's first X-Men movie,it's more of a (re)introduction that promises a greater follow up.
B000J103X4|4.0|this album is a pure classic. the game has ressurected the west coast and deserves all the respect in the world. the beats are great and lyrics are undeniably great. i love every song on this album. the only thing that i dont like that he namedrops every 2 seconds. he has said dr. dre's name over 44 times. All he talks about on this album is his impala, dr. dre, and compton, and a few other artists. Thats the only bad side, but other than that doctor's advocate is defenately worth buying and i listen to it everyday.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|When watching the third X Men movie, one cannot help but wonder if Bryan Singer was involved in the movie.Brett Ratner does a credible job on his contribution to a movie franchise that Singer defined. <br /> The movie is loaded with great action sequences,new characters,plot twists and and resolutions.Unfortunately at 105 minutes it crams in too much when an over two hour screen time would better service under developed elements(The Phoenix,and the off-screen death of a beloved X-Men)and characters(Angel,Beast,Juggernaught,Rogue). <br />  The endings leaves the door open for this not to be the \\"Last\\" stand of the cinimatic adventure of the X-Men.
B000084T18|5.0|this album goes down as one of the greatest albums ever made. this album came out about 3 or 4 years ago and i still hear songs from this album every single day. i rarely give 5 stars, but this album is perfect. 50
B000JLTRIG|5.0|While this may not be the BEST Season of Charmed, it definitally is up in the top 3.... The only regret that I have is that, like all the other Season released so far, there won't be extra's on it.... It looks like we'll have to wait for the 8th and final Season to be released to get those.... Hopefully we won't have to wait too long for that....
B00005JPCD|5.0|Happy Feet was the most entertaining movie I have seen in a while.  Actually this was the best animated movie that I seen. I thought the \\"Lion King\\" was fantastic, it was but the special effects for this movie were even better. The music was fabulous.  The dancing was truly entertaining. It was a movie that I think everyone should try - I can't wait until it comes out on DVD I will be one of the first people in line to purchase it.  I am going to go and see it again, I came home and told my husband that this movie was fantastic and we should go and see it (did you hear me - I said WE should go see it.   I went to the movie with my daughter (an  adult) and my grandchildren.  I think I enjoyed the movie more than my grandchildren did.  If there would have been music playing I would have danced out of the show - boy I am glad they didn't.   I am going to buy the soundtrack for this movie today  on amazon.  Just sit back and relax - release all the troubles from your day.  This movie was fantastic.  I do not want to start telling you any details about the movie because I will not shut up.  The penguins are all so precious.  I just want to hug them all.  The message I got from this movie was we \\"aliens - humans\\" are litter bugs.  We are destroying each other.  Have you ever been walking or driving down the street and watch someone open their car door and throw trash out on the street.  Like you couldn't keep that bag or fries or whatever the trash is on the floor until you got home or maybe you could pulled up in an alley and threw the trash in the garbage can.  Wow! that would be too easy wouldn't it?  This is the reason we have rats and mice and other disgusting creators running around the city.  Humans are some of the nasties creators in the world.  We are slowing destroying each other all by ourselves.   If that was the point the author was trying to make I got it.  Hope some other \\"aliens\\" adults and kids get it too and use the trash cans.  (This is a issue that I take very seriously.  Look at your city closely and maybe you would too)   <br /> <br />Anyway the movie was truly entertainment.  I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end.  I tried to sing - tapping my feet - laughed - and was truly entertained by the penguins  -  Some elderly people that do not understand change or are afraid of changing, choose not the make changes.  Since it was done this way for years and years, we have to continue to do it that way.  Recognize some these \\"aliens\\", I do.  See them everyday.    \\"Aliens\\" that believe that all people should be identical.  People are different and just because I might not be able to do something like you, then I am not as good as you.  That sad..  Don't turn your nose up at someone just because you can do something better than they can.  I believe that everyone has some type of talent.  We have a real problem with prejudging each other.  \\"Aliens\\" and even Penguins prejudge each other.  Okay I am going off on something a lot deeper than I planed to.  <br /> <br />Just sit back and enjoy the movie and I hope you are as entertained as I was.  Take your kids to the movie and watch them laugh.  I child laughter is the greatest feeling in the world. Look at yourself, you might be laughing too.  I bet if you look deep enough you might see yourself or someone that you recognize in one of the penguins.     <br /> <br />
B000000WA4|4.0|'Melon Collie and the Infinite Sadness' is as diverse and eclectic a rock album as you are likely to hear. As well as the heavier more regular rock songs like 'Jelly Belly' and 'Zero', this album has a lighter contrasting side with songs such as 'To Forgive', 'Cupid De Locke' and the violin bathed 'Tonight, Tonight'. It is because of this eclecticism that this album escapes the repetitive nature that certain other bands fall prey to. <br /> <br />There is much negativity in certain places throughout the lyrics: \\"God is empty, just like me\\". But this is not to say that the Pumpkins completely close the door on hope. Indeed it is their phases of optimism that tends to set them apart, this is an album which is lyrically courageous and dares to go to areas that other bands wouldn't. <br /> <br />Like all great albums 'Melon Collie and the Infinite Sadness' has the feel of a journey and not just a group of songs patched together. Essentially this is a wonderful and innovative album and is one of the must haves of 1990s rock.
B000I5X81K|3.0|A new Josh Groban cd is always a welcome breath of fresh air in this hip-hop/rap crazed world we live in.  Mr. Groban has a beautiful voice and is extremely talented.  That said, I have to admit I am disappointed with his lastest offering.<br /><br />While the lead single \\"You are Loved (Don't Give Up)\\" is a nice song, it doesn't really have the emotional punch of \\"You're Still You\\" from his debut cd or the holiday song, \\"Believe\\" from the Polar Express movie.  The one song I like the most is one of the spanish songs, \\"Solo Por Ti\\".  I also think \\"Lullaby\\" with Lady Blacksmith Mambazo is a pleasant song too.  However, the overall cd doesn't give me the desire to put it in the cd player and hit the repeat button, which is something I still do with his first collection of songs.<br /><br />One complaint I do have is the record companies releasing \\"special edition\\" cds and putting a couple of extra songs and maybe a video or two (plus the making of the video) on these overly priced attempts to sell more cds.  I think this is unfair to fans who truely love the songs of a particular artist and have to pay twice the regular price for a couple of extra songs....in this case the song \\"Awake\\", which I assume is the title track, is only available on the special edition cd.  Maybe those couple of extra songs would have encouraged me to give a higher rating for this cd.  I hope the next go round, Mr. Groban offers us a little more.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|This is a good show. At first I thought it would be a blowout but my friend (who loves Jensen Ackles) recommended it to me or else I probably wouldn't have watched it.If you are into ghosts and supernatural experinces than you will love this show.Season 2 is on now if you like season 1 it is on the CW at 9pm on Thursdays. If you want a little more of an idea of what the show's about think of it as a tv show based on the Amityville Horror movie.
B000GFLAI0|3.0|Lots of media-hype accompanied the release of this album, and in spite of it hitting #1 on the billboard album charts, I find this effort by Bob to be inferior to \\"Love & Theft\\",(01) and the grammy winning \\"Time Out of Mind\\",(98).  The arrangements are superb, the vocals are excellent, but the material is lacking in originality... many of these songs are re-writes of old blues or country standards.  A nice, listenable album - but nothing too earth-shaking or profound here.
B00005JPCD|5.0|I saw this movie yesterday.It is going to be a big box office hit. The cast is great while Britany Murphy, Nicole Kidman,Robin Williams,Elijah Wood and many others achieve high performances throughout this film.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|A simply gorgeous album from start to finish.  David Gilmour here has created mellow, warm music with that unmistakable Pink Floyd trademark sound. From the opening 'Dark-side-esque' sound collage and immpecable title track lusciously harmonized with David Crosby and Graham Nash, to the gently flowing existential nihilism of tracks such as \\"The Blue\\" and \\"Pocketful of Stones\\" - anyone who has ever enjoyed Pink Floyd should find this album a real delight. This CD could be easily listened to over a quiet meal, cocktails and conversation.  Nice work, David.
B000I0QK74|4.0|James Taylor's voice is like comfort food for the ears: distinctive but familiar, mellow and soulful.  So it seemed inevitable that he would eventually put out a Christmas album, and as one might expect, his voice and laid-back style are a perfect fit with the material.  My only criticism is that I wish he'd taken a few more chances with it.  JT performs many of the standard chestnuts, like \\"Winter Wonderland\\", \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\", and several others you've heard a million times before.  But what really saves this album from the run-of-the-mill are his versions of some of the religious carols here, especially the gorgeous but little-performed \\"Some Children See Him\\", as well as \\"Go Tell it on the Mountain\\", \\"Who Comes This Night\\", and Holst's beautiful \\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\".  He also does a pretty jazzy \\"Jingle Bells\\" (I would have liked more of this kind of arrangement, and less of those sappy strings).    He presents a fine interpretation of Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\", which seems to be turning into a holiday standard; and a charming duet with Natalie Cole on \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\".  Finally, he reminds us that \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" has more than one verse.  JT hasn't lost his mellfluous touch, and I doubt you'll find a much better pop Christmas album this season.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Not a fan of graphic novels or CGI, I was fully prepared to dislike this movie, but found it to be so well written, cast and shot that I will no doubt buy it for my collection. It's a dark movie, subversive really, but carries a strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the people, that one strong person with a will, determination and the cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them, can turn the tide. It's a powerful message, and it's beautifully displayed with imaginative imagery, symbolism and script. Bravo!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I had never seen this , but like the spooky stuff. Decided to buy it and I was not disappointed. Each story is as great as the one before it. All original and not the some old same old !!  Just a great and entertaining show!!!
B0009P42VE|4.0|At the end of the 1970s, Monty Python was the height of British Humor. Since we Yanks have had a bit of an inferiority complex about that for the last couple-hundred years, that made them the height of humor. Add in that whole legendary grail thing. C'mon guys, you've had centuries - longer if you paint yourselves blue. This side of the pond, we don't have legends. Heck, we've barely had time for any good juicy rumors. Bring `em on! We'll love it!<br /><br />And we have loved it well, for these many years. The broad gag, the running joke, the literate aside, we've spent years here trying to show y'all that it didn't go over our heads. It really was funny. Lots of it still is.<br /><br />But times have moved on. Parts are still good, but standards have changed. Fer cryin' out loud, a geeky high school boy with no girlfriend has more gigaflops in his botnet then existed back then. Effects? That's not effects. THIS is effects!<br /><br />The movie was as good now as it was then, but \\"good\\" now isn't what was \\"good\\" then. I found the extras to be extraneous. Memory was much kinder to this movie than reality testing was, except in a few places:<br /><br />\\"I got better.\\"<br /><br />\\"I will taunt you again.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'll bite your legs off.\\"<br /><br />But alas, there is no I in \\"reminiscing.\\" Well, it's a metaphor. If you just have to be that niggly about it, there are three, but I meant the higher I that it doesn't have, in that metaphoric way. Well, it's my metaphor and it means what I said it means. What do you mean, what I mean? I mean - I mean that you mean what I mean, but not the way you mean it. What do you mean, that you don't mean what I said you mean that I mean? I meant that I meant that you meant that ... never mind.<br /><br />//wiredweird
0307346609|5.0|I purchased \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" awhile ago, not realizing at first that the author of it and this book are one and the same. I have to say, I'm more than impressed; the book is a real grand piece of work.<br /><br />Done in the form of interviews of survivors of \\"World War Z\\", it paints a thorough and frightening picture of a world that slowly devolves into chaos, showing the crisis from the viewpoints of soldier and average man, of the politician and the physician, and from the level of those who would take advantage of the situation and those who would try to deal with it. One thing that surprised me is that the author, Max Brooks, is the son of Mel Brooks; apparently, talent really runs in that family.<br /><br />It is, at moments, a chilling book because its perspective is reminscent of real war commentaries; it is done very, very well and is convincing in its detail and scope. Anyone who loves stories about the living dead should read this; I think it will become a great addition to anyone's horror collection. This, plus the \\"Zombie Survival Guide\\" will prepare you for any incursions by the living dead, or just the living, who at times are just as scary.

Perhaps I will try again some time;  the book is still weighing down the shelf.
B00005JPCA|5.0|There was never any doubt in my mind that  Daniel Craig would make a sterling James Bond as I have seen  most of his edgy, out of the box film roles in \\"Layer Cake,\\" The Mother,\\" Sylvia,\\" \\"Munich,\\" \\"Road to Perdition\\" to name several. Craig is and has always had weight, focus and importance on the screen. And as James Bond he brings all of these qualities to bear and \\"Casino Royale\\" is the better for it.<br />Many actors were rumored to have been considered for the re-inventing of James Bond and Daniel Craig was not a popular choice but his interpretation here should put all the naysayers at bay for Craig more than re-invents...he makes this part his own.<br />Martin Campbell (\\"Goldeneye,\\" \\"Beyond Borders\\") stays clear of all the wham-bam, thank you M'am special effects of all the former James Bond films and concentrates on the things that make all films important: character, relationships and emotional commitment.<br />The James Bond of \\"Casino Royale\\" (it was the first in Ian Fleming's series of books on Bond) has just been given the so-called honor of the \\"007\\" impranteur and, though he has been an operative for a time, he is still considered the odd man out, the dangerous one, the one who will stop at nothing to solves his cases. On the surface this would seem like the ideal government spy but the operative word here is \\"government,\\" the biggest block of bureaucracy there ever is or was and as such \\"it\\" requires Bond to follow procedure as M (Judi Dench) reminds him time and again.<br />The Bond of \\"Casino Royale\\"is physical, violent, without too much conscience, sexy, fit: more likely to kick you in the groin than serve you a glass of White Burgundy. But this Bond also has a heart and, though he has a couple of dalliances with women, he makes a real connection to one in particular, Eva Green as Vesper Lynd. Though I would have liked somone with a warmer, cushier screen presence than Green, this romance also sets up what is to become of Bond, romance-wise for the rest of the Bond series of novels and, I assume....films.<br />The action sequences are personal and physical (the kind that you never saw Brosnan do) as well as excitingly staged and produced. \\"Casino Royale\\" marks a change of direction and focus of the Bond franchise and from the evidence on the screen, I would have to say it looks like the producers have a winner in Daniel Craig and a homerun in their first outing with him.nd series of novels and, I assume....films.

B000H30B2C|3.0|Let me first say that I am a great fan of Jackson's LOTR trilogy. After that, I looked forward immensely to his King Kong remake. But on seeing the new Kong, I confess to some disappointment. The movie works well if you are not a 1933 KK fan and are uncritical in terms of the action sequences. To set it in the period of the original was a really good (and, I thought, brave) choice - but having done that, Jackson then chooses to follow the lines of the De Laurentis 1976 remake rather than the original. Unlike the original (and as in the 1976 version), the natives completely disappear after the first (scarily well done) encounter! Why? Gone are the later scenes of Kong attacking the native encampment, gone are the scenes of natives being stomped underfoot, gone are the scenes of heads bitten off. The 1976 approach is also followed in the relationship between Anne and Kong - in the original, Anne remains petrified of Kong (to great effect) throughout the whole movie (and, of course, she would be wouldn't she?); here (as in the '76 remake), there is a (much less effective) rapport between beauty and the beast.  <br />In an interview on Australian TV, Jackson stated that he wanted to make Kong as \\"real as possible\\". Unfortunately, in places it is anything but! As an example, the famous log scene from the original is remade well to a degree, but in the original people fell to their deaths and stayed dead. The supposedly lost spider sequence is resurrected here but spoiled because it is difficult to believe that the survivors of the fall are not only alive (they must have fallen 30 - 40 metres!) but uninjured (here my suspension of disbelief - rather necessary for a movie of this nature - is shattered!). On top of this, I am expected to believe that a machine gun    can kill a creature attacking (and clinging to) a human without killing (or even scratching) the human - come on! (On a similar note, the dinosaur stampede is not only NOT as \\"real as possible\\", it's just plainsilly.) OK, despite the above, I enjoyed the movie. And yes, I have the first release DVD. I note that there is now an extended edition (perhaps the natives will reappear - but I doubt it!). If it had a 96/24 DTS soundtrack (or even just a DTS surround soundtrack), I might even have bought it! As it is...
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Wow - it's been an extremely long time since I was impressed and amazed with a band over and over again with each new album.  My Chemical Romance has grown tremendously and will definately win over many new fans with the release of The Black Parade.  Every single song on this album is excellent. There is not one that I wouldn't give 5 stars to.  I love them all.  I highly recommend this album for any fan of rock - and if you aren't a fan - listen to this album and you just might change your mind.
B000002AGY|5.0|\\"Concierto\\" was recorded April 16th and 23rd at Van Gelder Studios, 1975. It is perhaps the most beautiful and lyrical jazz guitar album of all time. There's something about this album that just makes everything else seem secondary. That's an extreme statement for an extreme album.<br /><br />Joining Jim Hall on this session are some really fantastic players. All these players are capable of impeccable lyricism and creative improvisation. Chet Baker on trumpet is a good choice. He always manages to find his voice on a record and does a fine job at providing that voice. Paul Desmond is on alto saxophone and is by far, in my opinion, one of the greatest alto players of his generation. He was so smooth and his technique was unmatched. What a wonderful player he was! Desmond had also been playing with Hall alot in those days. I would also suggest as a companion album to pick up \\"First Place Again,\\" \\"Blue,\\" or \\"Take Ten.\\" All are fine albums by Desmond and also feature Jim Hall on guitar. On piano is Roland Hanna, whose name I was very unfamiliar with up until recently when I bought some Emily Remler albums. He's one of the greats and it's a shame I'm not more familiar with his work. On drums is Steve Gadd who is probably one of the finest drummers of our time. He's done alot of jazz fusion work too most notably with Al Di Meola and Jeff Beck. He surprisingly fits well into this group. He kind of lays back and goes with the flow instead of trying to outplay everyone. Finally we have Jim Hall whose one of the great jazz guitarists of our time. He's so lyrical with his playing and understated. He blends so well with other players. Never crowds them or tries to outplay them. Hall doesn't or never has had an ego. I can tell when somebody has an ego. In fact, most listeners of jazz music can tell when a musician has an ego they try to hog all the space and don't leave any room for the other players. Hall was never like that. He's also not about chops, although the man has plenty, he's not a flashy jazz player. He doesn't resort to licks. Every note the man plays is carefully constructed. A very subtle, melodic, and textural guitar player and an absolute master of harmony.<br /><br />If you're a fan of jazz guitar, then you owe to yourself to acquire this fine release.nty, he's not a flashy jazz player.

B00005JPCA|2.0|Okay, there's a current trend right now to do prequels and reimagine old standards. Excellent examples of this working are the New Battlestar Galactica Series and Batman Begins. However, Casino Royale is what happens when you attempt to force this and you end up with a product that's neither true to the standing mythos nor compelling enough to make the departure worth while.<br /><br />To list every departure from the mythos might come close to being a spolier, so I will only list a few. Although how you \\"spoil\\" something so half-baked I have no idea.<br /><br />Here Bond is not suave.<br /><br />There is no Q and the gadgets are anything but Bond quality.<br /><br />The villians lack those quinessential conspicious characteristcs that have made them so important in the past.<br /><br />The \\"now-I've-got-you-Mr.-Bond\\"  torture is not \\"creative\\" in the Bond fashion, but rather like something that Quenton Tarintino would have thought up on a bad day. Actually, that's not fair to Tartintino. The torture shown is something a Tarintino wanna-be would have thought up on a bad day.<br /><br />Plus, there is a plot hole large enough to drive a semi convoy through, turn around in and drive back.<br /><br />In fact, there is only one scene that gives that \\"How Bond Began Feeling\\" and consists of a simple moment with just Daniel Craig and a mirror. This is the only reason that I think that maybe, just maybe, Daniel Craig can pull Bond off in the future with a script worth putting on the screen.<br /><br />All in all, this film feels as if someone tried to make James Bond grittier, realized it wasn't really a Bond film anymore and tried to cover it up saying, \\"That's okay. We'll just make a prequel.\\" Well it didn't work.
0393061434|4.0|I've never been one to drink the Apple Kool-Aid.  I use a Windows PC and I've never owned an iPod.  I almost headed down this path in 1984 though, when I was one of the first people to buy an original Macintosh.  The only reason I made the $2,500(!) investment (plus an additional $500 for an ImageWriter printer) was because I was writing a book about that revolutionary computer.<br /><br />Despite my limited Apple history, I've always been interested in the two icons behind the company: Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.  Jobs gets a lot more visibility and I think the typical person knows more about him than Woz, which is why I quickly snagged a copy of iWoz: From Computer Geek to Cult Icon when I saw it was available.<br /><br />The book gets off to a rather painfully slow start.  In fact, I almost put it down after about 40 or 50 pages of reading.  Once he gets past his childhood and into college it starts to get more interesting.  Woz obviously loves playing practical jokes and his carefree attitude comes through in the writing.  The guy is also nothing short of a genius, and when you read about how he used to design computers with nothing more than paper and pencil you'll quickly agree.<br /><br />The most interesting aspect of the story has to do with Woz's days as an engineer at HP, prior to the launch of Apple.  Here's a guy who had designed the Apple I in his free time and was pleading with HP management to let him get involved in their plans to make a personal computer.  They not only turned him down, they went so far as to reject his design, giving him the freedom to develop the Apple I on his own.  Oops!  The rest is history, of course, but this has to go down as one of the biggest corporate screw-ups in American history.<br /><br />Once you get past the first 50 pages this is very much an engaging read.  It was also interesting to watch as the Apple II becomes a blockbuster, but the first corporately-designed model, the Apple III, becomes a classic case study of \\"too many cooks in the kitchen.\\"es a classic case study of \\"too many cooks in the kitchen.\\"
B00001U0DP|5.0|I love this movie...I watch it every chance I get.The first half of the movie shows ,the way you present yourself to others creates a positive or negative reality.The second half of the movie deals with how things are presented to us and how we react to those things...creating a positive or negative reality..If a young boy can be made to feel safe,happy and loved in a concentration camp anything is possible...LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL......
B00005JNS0|4.0|I tend to agree with critics who reviewed this film when it was released. <br /> <br />Not up to normal/past Pixar standards. <br /> <br />I say it is most like A Bugs Life.

B000HEWEE4|1.0|If you loved the Back to the Future trilogy and, generally speaking, time traveling extravaganzas on the silver screen... simply forget about buying this DVD. All being well it would make you feel like a total idiot for the first half of the movie, while you try to figure out all the \\"time-traveling science\\" you've been taught so far, then space you out close to the end, leaving you totally speechless. This is not good, simply because the producers and the writers probably went crazy themselves trying to emulate the real time-traveling pros, while winding up with some abrubt, nonsense end of the movie, with absolutely no sci-fi logic at all: they simply had to eventually stop shooting, so they just thought any happy ending would have done the trick, no matter the time differences and the numberless loose ends still untied in the plot. Not a sci-fi movie and not a romantic story either: look elsewhere for any of these two types of movie.
B00003CXBK|4.0|This is another beautiful animated adventure by Hayao Miyazaki. Cons: I gave it four stars because it if definitely not for little eyes-heed the PG13 rating.   Princess Mononoke has a lot of bad language, violence, gore, and many adult themes-like the fact that the fighting girls come from a brothel.  When my 10 year old asked what that was, I realized this movie is for grown-ups.  It was not Hayao's usual adventure that brings a child far away into his or her imagination, and brings a grown person like me back to my childhood.  This film is dark and tortures the soul with a theme of humans once again killing what is innocent and beautiful for selfish reasons. Now for the Pros:  Hayao Miyazaki is a genius once again with his characters, animation, and theme.  Princess Mononoke is going to pull you in and make you fight for whichever side you choose, and not let you go until the very end.  Excellent for grown-ups who want to 'escape' the real world for a while, join forces with Hayao's good Asitaka & Mononoke or the evil Lady Eboshi characters, and fight for what they believe in.  A definite must for Anime lovers.

B000002J09|5.0|Few rock bands know when they're going to make history.  Such was the case with Led Zeppelin and their fourth album.<br /><br />In 1971, Led Zeppelin was wrecking its way through the rock scene and setting the stage that many others would eventually follow. The band kept getting better and better on the road and in the studio, and then delivered this: the untitled fourth album.<br /><br />What strikes me about the album over 20 years since I first heard it, is the unbridled sound and passion of a band intent on conquering the world.  Sheer power in the form of \\"Black Dog\\" and \\"Rock n Roll\\" open the album followed by the lyrical interlude of the \\"Battle of Evermore\\" and the Lord of the Rings journey of \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\"<br /><br />The album interprets Jimmy Page's sonic vision of what he called: 'light and shade.'  But it's Robert Plant's rocket voice that seems to soar higher and higher into an uncharted terrain with tracks like \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" and \\"Four Sticks\\" that reflects the no-limits approach of the band at this stage.<br /><br />Plant might have done his voice more harm than good in trying to hit the superhigh notes, but he carved the band a place in rock history.<br /><br />Then with \\"Going to California\\" - Zep settles into their folk roots.  Bonzo's drums crash in like thunder on \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" - a radical reworking of Memphis Minnie's old blues - and with Plant singing \\"going down\\" to Page's distorted guitar - Zep's epic fourth adventure comes to an end.<br /><br />The world would never be the same again after this soundscape.<br /><br />Zep was later reviled as being a dinosaur of rock by some, but close listening to this album reveal a band ahead of its time and highly cutting-edge.  Radical, experimental and fearless,the band was totally committed to its own direction.  That alone makes this an immortal release.

B00005JPCF|4.0|This is definitely an enjoyable movie.  Having penguins helps in that regard.  It is definitely in the same genre of films as Rudolph the Reindeer; a social outcast for being different, his special ability saves the day<br /><br />This is a move to just relax and enjoy, for the most part.  The cool Antarctic scenery and the multitude of penguins is vsiual eye candy.  One scene is like a roller coaster simulator in its animation.  There are four types of penguins shown: mostly Emperors, the five adelies who are Mumble's closest friends, the Rockhopper sage, and the chinstraps at the zoo.  Also shown are leapard seals, elephant seals, skuas, and killer whales.<br /><br />The problems in the movie come about when they decide to inject humans in the movie.  The humans were like braking from 100mph to 0 in a second.  It was that jarring.  They made zoos seem like jails.  It is understandable that some see a slight anti-religioun message, but its more against conformity than religion.  Still, it could have been done without and still keep the story going.  Of course, I was afraid from reviews I read before going that it was going to be too political in the end, but fortunately they kept to the banes of over-fishing and did not discuss global warning theories.<br /><br />The movie itself is slightly above 4 stars, but the above mention faults keep it from a five.  But if this DVD has extras aplenty, it will easily be a five.  Especially since people can fast forward thru the scenes with humans and stick to the penguins.
1594200823|5.0|<br />Toward the very beginning of Michael Pollan's \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\", there is a rather simple statement of purpose of what is going to transpire over the following 400 pages.  \\"This is a book about the pleasures of eating, the kinds of pleasure that are only deepened by knowing.\\"  Over the course of the pages, Pollan leads us toward the intimate processes that supply four meals, from McDonald's (where apparently one out of three children are getting at least one meal a day) to a modern hunter-gathering meal (or as he says, \\"a meal eaten in full consciousness\\"). <br /> <br />The omnivore is an animal that requires neither a vegetarian's or carnivore's dietetic imperatives.  Each meal is suffused with choice.  A koala bear is tied to eucalyptus leaves (or a baleen whale to plankton) in ways that we can't understand.  In fact, much of brain thought function may have evolved in posing the question: \\"What should I eat?\\"  An interesting feature of the opacity of modern food production is how unclear the answer to that question is.  It's unclear that the hamburger prepared for lunch comes from a cow.  It's puzzling to see the connection between that chicken nugget and the chicken.  Even more puzzling is the nutritional differences between the salmon caught wild in the ocean versus raised in a fresh water farm.  Particularly when the cow has been fed parts from chicken, the chicken from the cow and the salmon from corn.  The question then can be not so much what should I eat as what am I eating? <br /> <br />Wendell Berry defines eating as an agricultural act, so it is fitting that most of the detai in this book is in the food system of this country.  Pollan examines how food comes from seed to the plate (or in the case of those soups that you microwave and serve right out of the designed-to-fit-your-car's-cupholder cup).  The star of the agribusiness model (and therefore, the reigning supermarket champion) is corn (maize). <br /> <br />Pollan refers to corn as the \\"proto-capitalist plant\\".  It has a duality of being both a food and an abstract commodity (a deferred food).  In many ways, it is a species that has evolved in total dependence of humanity (to seed it, havest it, distribute it and have it colonize currently over 125,000 square miles in the US-an area more than double that of New York state).  Another adaptation that is keen for business is that recently engineered seed has qualities that don't propigate to to the next generation.  That is it allows the seed companies to not only sell you seed this year, but have you coming back for more next year (because the seed you might take from this year's crop will be far less productive in the next generation). <br /> <br />The overgrowth of corn has led to many sorts of uses of corn as a processed food.  It is used as feed to all manner of animal.  It is used mixed in with fuels.  It is used as a filler.  It is used to put the sheen on a magazine cover.  When Pollan sits down (in his car on the highway) to his McDonald's meal, the soda (high fructose corn syrup), burger (beef that was grain fed at consolidated animal feeding operation), fries (immersed and sponging up corn oil) are more corn than not. <br /> <br />There are nutritional problems to eating beef that are fed this corn-centric diet.  They are higher in saturated fat and lower in omega-3 fatty acids.  Ruminants have adapted through evolution to eat grasses and have rumen specifically to process  those grasses.  When they eat a diet of corn, they are subject to rumenitis (among other ills).  They need to be medicated with Rumensin and Tylosin to survive the corn diet they are fed on the feed lot.  It is so injurious to their health that 15%-30% of feedlot cattle have abscessed livers.  As poorly as ruminants are adapted to eating corn, humans may be as poorly adapted to eating ruminants who are adapted to eating corn.  We may see this in the rates of diseases like obesity, type-2 diabetes and heart disease. <br /> <br />Pollan makes an interesting comparison to the early 19th century \\"Republic of Alcohol\\" calling our current situation, \\"Republic of Fat\\".  The supersizing effect on U.S. culture has been such that per annum, per capita consumption of sugars increased from 128 pounds to 158 pounds in the 20 years between 1985 to 2005.  Worldwide, the UN reports that there are now more people over-nourished (1 billion) than under-nourished (800 million). <br /> <br />The industry that drives this runs on cheap corn fuel (literally to some degree as ethanol becomes more ubiquitous).  The cheapness though, has hidden costs.  Corn production in the current agro-industrial sense requires fossil fuels for the means of capital that plant and harvest it (combines, tractors, etc.), but also for the nitrogen fertilizers (synthesized from natural gas).  Corn price shortfalls are subsidized by the government (which results in perpetual corn over-production).  The corn operations are a small set of seeds that are grown as a monoculture with pesiticides and fertilizing and soil management that compromise the farmland ecology.  And as far as costs go it piles up because plants grown in synthetically fertilized soils are less nourishing, are more vulnerable to disease and pests and polycutures are more productive and less prone to disease than monocultures. <br /> <br />There are other alternatives to this industry.  There is an organic movement that has been developing since the 1960s and also a local foods movement movement which can be viewed in the growth of farmer's markets over the past 40 years.  Pollan's second meal represented foods that come out of the organic movement, but do not share the local nature of the beyond organic or \\"Clean Foods\\" movement.  This \\"Big Organic\\" shares some of the industrial nature of the mainstream agrobusiness, while excising the use of synthetics (particularly fertilizers, pesticides and antibiotic medications).  Clearly, \\"Big Organic\\" attempts to address some of the more egregious failings of agrobusiness.  It's an incremental change, though, when fossil fuels are not used to fertilize the soil, but are used to haul in the manure that will do so.  It's a small incremental change indeed when an out-of-season bunch of asparagus is flown in from Argentina and marketed as organic.  It's quite hard to see what is organic at all about that refrigerated 747 ride (Pollan described it as tasting like cardboard, so it wasn't a even a guilty pleasure -- more of a guilty mild-annoyance). <br /> <br />In the smaller scale, the local, clean food movement, Pollan spends a week on a farm owned by Joel Salatin in Virginia (with a farmer who would not FedEx food out to Pollan in Berkeley, CA).  This represents the shift of focus from the industrial to the artisanal model.  The farmer Pollan stays with advocates management intensive grazing.  The benefits of this farming practice is that the livestock grazes off grasses and the grasses in turn feed off the nitrogren in the livestock's manure. In effect, the grass grows and feeds the cattle, the cattle clip the grass (and take care of any trees or shrubs), the poultry follows up and takes care of grubs and insect, not to mention grains left in the cattle's wake.  It's a symbiotic process.  The manure from both sustain the grass as the grass sustains the animals.  Which is a brilliant solution to the nutrient problem which large scale industry attempts to solve with synthetic fertilizers and pest controls.  In effect, agrobusiness creates a problem out of a process that has previously been solved.  Prior to the industrial development of fossil-fuel farming, a farm was basically a solar engine behaving basically by the grace of photosynthesis. <br /> <br />Salatin's farm is on a piece of land in Virginia that had been scraped of it's top soils.  Part of the farming strategy is recovering viable pasture land out of a parcel that had been viewed as non-viable.  Topsoil is built up notonly by the accumulation of plant leaves and manure, but moreso by the growth and grazing cycles of the grass due to the cattle and poultry.  In a grassland, the greatest source of humus is from decaying roots (which die back to bring stasis with the biomass (i.e. the leaves of grass).  Salatin says that the greatest efficiency of a farm treated as a biological system is health. <br /> <br />For Pollan's final meal, he sought a number of people to assist him in hunting a feral pig,  gathering mushrooms (morels), gathering salt from San Francisco Bay (which he ended up abandoning because of its nastiness), plus various other locally culivated items.  Pollan confronts the ethics of eating meat particularly from the perspective of if one is to eat meat, then one should be able to experience the consequences of the animal's death.  At one point, Pollan's answer to that question is to be a vegetarian.  Ultimately, Pollan is able to eat meat, but one sees him as eating with much greater intention.  Aldo Leopold said, \\"there is value in any experience that reminds us of our dependency on the soil-plant-animal-man food chain.\\" <br /> <br />Pollan shoots his own wild boar (and ruminates of Hemingway and Jose Ortega y Gasset.  He describes the thrill of the deed and then the guilt, the exhileration and the revulsion.  Ambivalance and ambiguity are a hunter's lot and likely leads to harsh reflection for someone viewing it with great intention.  However, in the same way that it is life-denying to corn-feed cattle for 150 days to create a desirable balance of fat and meat, the act of hunting is clearly life-affirming in preserving a carnivore role and allowing animals that become food to exist with their essential animal character until their death. <br /> <br />What Pollan offers in this book, isn't so much a way of living perfectly as much as pointing out what actually is going on in terms of consequences for these 4 meals.  Specifically, this is addressed by how Pollan himself ended the book.  \\"We eat by the grace of nature.  What we're eating is never anything more or less than the body of the world.\\"
B000H5U832|2.0|I'm a language teacher and I have a number of DVDs that I use at school as language tools.  DVDs are great because they're inexpensive teaching aids when it comes to foreign languages...but only when the DVDs actually have other tracks than English.  Nowadays practically every released movie has language tracks and sometimes subtitles in other languages but this DVD seems like a hearkening back to the dark ages when people were lucky just to get a movie on this format and no extra effort whatsoever was put into a movie's release on DVD.  I was pretty disappointed to discover just as the DVD was shipping that it wasn't what I thought it was going to be.  I suppose it's my fault for assuming, but I feel ripped off just the same.
0743289412|4.0|Like many reveiwers have already stated, this is a different type of King novel. There definitely is a slow unwind at the start for the first hundred and fifity pages or so, but I personally found much of it engaging. Beyond the main love story and Lisey's coping with grief over the loss of her writer husband, much of the book deals with Scott's damaged childhood, and the outlets the creative mind take to cope and fabricate in order to survive, but also in his case, to thrive.<br /><br />The climax for me was a slight disappointment, however the book overall was a reinvigorated and different world for King.

B00005JOQS|1.0|There are two main reasons why this Superman film fails to fly inspite of the special effects. <br /> <br />What Singer and company have missed is the heart of Superman - virtues.  The ideal of the American way (noticably absent) is supposed to go hand in hand with truth and justice.  Donner made the mistake in the 70's of having Superman sleep with Lois, and now Singer adds insult to injury by having Superman discover he has an illegitmate child that he doesn't take responsibility for (deadbeat dad).  Using his super powers to invade the privacy of Lois in her home, drags Superman down to the level of creepy (peeping tom). <br /> <br />The second issue concerns personality.  Routh and Bosworth look nice but have no charm and no chemistry.  These are the two ingredients that made Reeves and Kidder so endearing. <br /> <br />A new director, writers, and cast is needed.  Until then, at least there's Superman 1. <br />
B00005JPAD|4.0|Scorsese is not one of my favorites, but he's moving up.  This movie takes a long moment to get into, but once it gets going you do get emotionally invested.  Of course, I'm still wondering what was in the brown envelope Costigan gave the therapist, but whateva.  There is nothing new as far as the old adage \\"you live by the sword (or gun) then you die by the sword (or gun)\\"  Liars are trying to find out who's lying and so on and so on.  Given how some scenes are choppy, I have a feeling the DVD is going to have a director's cut version because I think there so much of this film that was left on the cutting room floor.  By the last act when people started dropping like flies, the script lost me.  Not that I was confused, but I simply stop caring what happened.  I was like Sullivan's character when he muttered his last line. \\"All right then\\".  I'm in the audience muttering to the screen 'sure, why not?'  It's a good film in a long season mediocre films. Recommended.
0385720920|3.0|Palahniuk is an extremely talented writer.  And I'll admit, I laughed out loud several times.  It was a fun read, which is almost enough to recommend it.  But in the end, it feels like so many empty calories.  There's just no depth here.  And the ending seemed thrown together at the last minute.  But I guess if you're looking for something light and entertaining, you could do a lot worse.
B00001OH7Y|4.0|I'm a guitar fan and this is a most enjoyable Bowie cd, especially because of the guitars.<br /><br />There are some gem songs like \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", \\"Its No Game\\", \\"Fashion\\" and \\"Kingdom Come\\". However, the real highpoint here is the incredible and extremely innovative musicianship.<br /><br />Bowie took eccentric lyrics, unusual time signatures and then applied stellar and inventive musicians to color these songs. I believe Robert Fripp and Adrien Below were the featured guitar players.<br /><br />Check out the strange, angular guitar runs on \\"Fashion\\"<br /><br />After this album he went way too commercial. With the exception of thrusting Stevie Rae Vaughn into the limelight, I do not like what Bowie did after this in the 1980's.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh has done it again but this time, he has gone way beyond in his choice of songs and the instrumentals. <br />After listening to You are Loved, how can anyone not feel loved!  And Lullaby brings tears to your eyes for all children of the world...how beautiful. <br /> <br />Then wham -  he wakes you up with Machine...very different for him and kuddos Josh for stretching your creativity.   It worked and is amazing! <br /> <br />Only negative, not enough albums being produced.   Please produce more albums Josh, you're too talented to keep the world from hearing your gift...your voice.
B000I5X81A|5.0|I've been an avid fan of Eric Clapton's since his Yardbird days and have purchased any recording with his name on it.  Through about 40 years of listening to Eric Clapton, I discovered the amazing J.J. Cale and have purchased many of his recordings over the years as well.  This new CD is just fantastic!! Having these two legends together was well worth the wait! This CD is more Cale than Clapton, but both Cale and Clapton fans will not be disappointed. My favorite track is It's Easy, which in my opinion, is classic J.J. Cale.  Cale and Clapton seem so at ease with each other and it definitely shows throughout the entire CD. I recommend this CD most highly!!  Bravo, Mr. Cale and Mr. Clapton!!
B000I5X81A|4.0|It should surprise no one that this record would turn out so well. \\"After Midnight,\\" \\"Cocaine,\\" and a host of other tunes down the years have made it abundantly clear that Cale's writing was made for Clapton's performance. The only question is why did it take so long?  <br />Regardless of the answer, this is a treasure to savour like very fine cognac - it rolls around in your soul and then a very warm fire is lit. In many ways it is akin to Clapton's brilliant performance of Robert Johnson's songs. And there is one added bonus to this disc - it represents the last recordings of Billy Preston. As you listen to these delta blues unfurl, it is that rhythmic wash from Preston that brings the sultry breeze of the delta into these recordings. Nathan East and a host of brilliant Clapton sidemen are on board as well. But the recording sessions evidence just how much Cale and Clapton are brothers in arms. The title track is absolutely the perfect encapsulation of the entire effort, but there is just so much great music packed into this disc that you will not want it to end. <br />I wasn't crazy about the last studio effort from Clapton, and my essential point there was that he is not his own best friend as a songwriter. In less obvious tones, that is clear here as well. Clapton's two compositions are serviceable enough, but pale alongside Cale's sweltering tales. This is a minor carp. In point of fact, you'll hardly notice the difference in writers. Cale and Clapton are jined at the plectrum and I'm so very glad this finally happened. Stunning is the only word for it.
B00005JPCA|5.0|The Bond films have always been about male wish fulfillment. All the guys wish they could drink, dress, drive, fight and f*ck like Bond. In \\"Casino Royale,\\" Bond is still the ultimate man's man, but he's also something else: human.<br /><br />He makes mistakes. He has flaws. In this film, he learns and matures and develops as a person. Also, the women in his life are real, three-dimensional characters with distinct personalities and motivations. If you're not familiar with the Bond films, you're probably asking, \\"So what?\\" but those who know and love Bond will recognize this as a quantam leap forward.<br /><br />This gives the aging franchise a much-needed shot in the arm. I can now imagine 007 carrying on for another 40 years without seeming hopelessly dated.<br /><br />I hesitate to call it the best Bond film ever, but I think this is possibly the best Bond film in decades.
B000002LQD|2.0|A full cd made up of songs about death and loss is artistic and ambitious but has a lack of entertainment value.<br /><br />I admire how Lou Reed reduced his feelings to a recording however, for the listener, the dour theme prevents this from qualifying of being \\"repeated\\" listening.<br /><br />A better work concerning death is Warren Zevon's \\"The Wind\\". It is very heartwarming but, at the same time, Zevon (always an excellent songwriter) varies the mood rather then making every song so sad and somber.<br /><br />The first 4 songs of this are enjoyable (especially \\"Whats Good\\") but the rest is so depressing that it becomes quite ponderous.
B00005JPCA|5.0|Casino Royale with Daniel Craig as the legendary 007 is simply outstanding.  It is at least finest Bond film in decades and perhaps with the exception of the classic Goldfinger, the best of the entire series. <br /> <br />Craig is the finest incarnation of Bond since Connery.  He is physical, cold and extremely violent.  There is no hint of camp in Craig's 007 and this is a very welcome change in the series.  The viewer quickly understands that this 007 does not need any gadgets to do his dirtywork; this Bond does his damage up close and personal.  The effect this has on the viewer is striking. <br /> <br />This film with Craig has breathed new life into this series.  I cannot wait to see the next film.
B000AA305M|5.0|David Gray's \\"Life In Slow Motion\\" moved us through a critical transition in our lives...it's melodies led our spirits forward and spoke for our souls. This album will forever live in our hearts as music that spoke for us when we could barely speak for ourselves. We could listen to it every day and it would always bring us someplace new.  Soulful, moving...tranformational. Thank you, David.
B00005JPCA|5.0|1. the writing is as tight as anything in the Bourne series: believable, taut, nerve wracking, heart racing and frightening <br />2. the cinematography is breathtaking <br />3. the music enhances the film as no Bond music has since John Barry gave up the franchise <br />4. the acting is phenomenal, and it begins and ends with Craig. If you caught him in LAYER CAKE or MUNICH, you know he has an edge that is ruthless and sociopathic. The man looks and acts like a killer. This is the Bond that Fleming had in mind, and while Connery got close, even he wasn't this good. Forget everyone who followed, and to some extent that is a function of the writing as much as the acting. Not in this one, given the state of decline in the Bond series, it would all fall on Craig, and he delivers with deadly accuracy. If he does no more Bond films, he will have nonetheless rescued the franchise for the foreseeable future. <br />But it isn't just him. Dench seems delighted to play a real woman in charge, and not someone doing walk-on ripostes witha cardboard actor. There is both palpable tension and sexual attraction to the interplay between M and Bond that teeters close to Oedipal undercurrents. Bond is a man with precious little conscience. This film goes a long way to explaining how and why. The villains are perfect: intelligent, duplicitous, treacherous thugs as ready to club and torture a victim as delight in the scheming and the betrayals. Who is really who eludes you throughout the film. The women are diabolical and intelligent. No bimbos. Each of the women is some projection of M, like a diamond turning and catching the light in its facets. Understandably, it isn't a direct line, but step back and consider when M appears in each scene and why, and there's as much going on here as there was in Silence of The Lambs. Except we have Vodka instead of Chianti. <br />The movie is nearly free of product placement, and happily free of Cleese. He was never Q, and he should have been droppeda long time ago. Sony, Ford and Aston Martin make cameos, as does Bollinger, but all of them are less as prominent as they were with Brosnan, and never, ever get in the way. What happens to the Aston will break your heart, and maybe that's also the point. Everyone defined by their possessions is destroyed in this film. <br />I don't want to say too much about it, other than you will read in some newspaper reviews that the card game seemed long. BS. It fairly flies and is so wrought with tension you'll find yourself holding your breath. The original book was based on the game of Baccarat and the financing of organized crime. This is poker and the financing of terrorism. Craig was determined \\"to keep it real.\\" He did. In Spades. If you recall LAYER CAKE, about the last thing he says to the camera is \\"and I never told you my name....\\". Thus the theme song and the very final scene in this film resolve that. <br />It is a long movie, but it has so much heart and soul, you won't want it to end. It's violent, no nonsense crime, spies and peril. The women are both sexual objects and radical challenges to his perception of himself. And if the producers know what's good for them, they will take the lessons of this film and carry them forward. When the James Bond Theme kicks in at the end of the film, everyone in the theatre applauded. Well done, Daniel.
B00005JPCA|5.0|read the books, one reviewer whines about no gadgets and no austin powers type villian. This is the closest A movie has ever come to bond. the reviewer also complains about plotholes ummm and you didn't find any in moon raker I suspect if your reading this you'll see it because its bond, but you'll see it twice because its that damn good.
B00005JPC7|3.0|We are introduced to Harold Crick by Karen Effiel, who is writing a novel with him as the hero, or perhaps it is his watch that is the hero as she ascribes human feelings to it. Harold is an IRS agent who lives in a beige apartment and brushes his teeth the same amount of minutes each morning. He counts his steps and is very good at math. He apparently doesn't try anything  new. While brushing his teeth, he hears Karen narrating what he's doing. This narrating continues while he walks, works, etc. He's advised by a doctor to go to a literature professor. He goes to see one played by Dustin Hoffman, who reprises his role of the offbeat character he played in \\"I Heart Huckabees\\" and to a lesser degree, \\"Meet the Parents II\\".<br /><br />Harold accidentally hears Karen talking on a tape on the professor's television, and identifies her voice. She says she's writing a novel and describes Harold's life. The professor tells him that the tape is 10 years old and the author always kills her heroes. This disturbs Harold Crick as he tries to figure out how to meet her and get her to change her ending. The professor also tells Harold that he does not control his life, and Harold agrees with that. So who does control it - the author of the book? It appears so.<br /><br />In the meantime, he's come to the realization that it's time to live. He romantically pursues a bakery owner who didn't pay all of her taxes (for moral reasons), learns to play the guitar, and gives a present to a friend so that he can fulfill his dream.<br /><br />When he meets Karen, she becomes a little (more) unhinged. She's already finished the book, but hasn't typed it. She gives him the yellow legal pad papers and he takes it to the professor to read. He finishes is and tells Harold that he has to die, that it is a great death, and the book would not work without it. His death gives meaning to his pointless life. Harold reads it, sadly agrees it's fantastic, and resigns himself to die.<br /><br />Karen meets with the professor and discusses changing the ending. He dissuades her from this, extolling the book as one of the greatest ever written. Since she's been reading the whole thing throughout the movie, I didn't think so. It's extremely pedestrian, and since it's about Harold's life, it's boring. Just because there is a \\"magnificent\\" (or stupid and unnecessary) death as the ending, that does not mean that the book is good.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, of which the acting was wonderful, I was expecting some great revelation at the end. Were Harold and the other characters (such as the bus driver and the stupid brat who can't ride a bike) in the book and his life really real? Because of course we are not shown any scenes of life prior to the narrating of the novel. I thought the ending would be something mystical and uplifting, perhaps explained by a parallel universe, a spiritual meeting of the minds, or something else out of the ordinary.<br /><br />Instead, the ending ruins the movie. It cheapens it, it mainstreams it, and it was disappointing after the great buildup.<br /><br />However, what the movie is trying to say is: live now. Like the Addams Family - do what you want to do, live how you want to live, say what you want to say, be what you want to be, act how you want to act..../>Karen meets with the professor and discusses changing the ending.

B000002UUX|5.0|Rust In Peace defines \\"Heavy Metal\\". The formula for this album? Nuclear War meets Aliens / UFO conspiracy. Dave Mustaine is angry from Holy Wars to the last song, Rust In Peace... Polaris. Dawn Patrol isn't hard and fast like the others. Its slow, but you get the idea of the drowsey 3rd shift security at the nuclear power plant that could blowup at any second, which only adds to the album's theme. Tornado of Souls is fast and heav from beginning to end. Take No Prisoners, Dave is as angry and pissed off as in Holy Wars. Hanger 18, again, UFO conspiracy but it adds to mystery betwee that and nuclear holocuast. Five Magics, Poison Was the Cure, and Lucretia are interesting follow up songs to add in between and keep the story going. Unfortunatly, this would be Megadeth's only outstanding album in terms of Heavy Metal. If only Megadeth stayed on this path after their next album, Countdown to Extinction, they would have thrived to being the best Heavy Metal band ever.

B00005JPCA|4.0|Grammatically idiotic though it may be, the initial catchphrase for Casino Royale \\"James becomes Bond\\" is a pretty accurate descriptor for the movie. The film works as a reboot button, similar to Batman Begins, taking the character of James Bond back to his very first mission as MI6 agent 007. There's been a lot of hype surrounding this movie promising that this gritty, modern interpretation of Ian Fleming's classic secret agent will give a second wind to a series that has been struggling for years. Thankfully, Casino Royale doesn't disappoint. Daniel Craig does an excellent job of portraying Bond and he infuses the character with the rough edges that one would expect a novice \\"double O\\" to have. Bond's ego and arrogant recklessness provide many of the close calls that he very narrowly avoids; these scenes add a human element that has been missing in many of the Bond films. Bond's humanity is even more apparent in the ruthless manner he uses to get the job done, especially when compared to the typical, cold-blooded killing that he exercises later in his career. This new side of Bond hints at many layers of unexplored depth that make his character something far more interesting than the walking punch-line machine that he had become in previous installments. The villain, Le Chiffre (played by Mads Mikkelsen), is a more reined-in version of the madmen that Bond usually encounters thanks to the wise decision of skipping on the more camp elements for which the series' villains had become notorious. The battle that Le Chiffre and Bond have over a game of high-stakes poker provides the most tense moments of the movie, a scene that is sure to be loved by all Bond fans eager to see James back in playboy mode. Eva Green, though nothing out of the ordinary for a Bond girl, is just interesting enough as Vesper Lynd to make the audience care for her; her character is one of a handful of people that play a vital role in making Bond the gentleman spy that people know and love. The overall picture is wonderful but it's the smaller moments, such as Bond's birth as 007 and how he earns his first Aston Martin, that help make this installation, and Daniel Craig, the best Bond since Connery.overall picture is wonderful but it's the smaller moments, such as Bond's birth as 007 and how he earns his first Aston Martin, that help make this installation, and Daniel Craig, the best Bond since Connery.
B00005JPAM|1.0|In 1997, Tony Blair wins the peoples' vote to become Prime Minister. The Queen doesn't like this; apparently he is a modernist. However, she must follow proper protocol and ask him if he'll be prime minister. He says yes,  he and his wife back out of the room (never show your back to the queen), and then Princess Diana dies.<br /><br />She and Prince Philip don't think it's any big deal, but Prince Charles actually has a tear in his eye, and raves about what a great mother she was. This makes the Queen feel as though he's putting down her mothering skills. Anyway, as we all remember, the public went crazy with grief, and expected the royals to share in it. But they didn't, and that's what this whole film is about, which makes it super boring.<br /><br />Advisors are afoot everywhere, and Tony Blair finally talks the queen into coming back to London from her 40,000 estate in Balmoral. She happens to see a 14 point stag that her husband and grandkids have been stalking to get their minds off the death of their mother. Seeing the free and beautiful stag means something to her and she begins to cry (with her back to the camera). What does the stag mean? Does it represent Diana stalked by photographers, which some believe lead to her death? Or does the stag represent Diana as she was when married to Charles - stalked by the royal family trying to get her to change, never show her feelings, and put up with Charles having a mistress? OR, does the stag represent the Queen herself, roped into the monarchy due to her father's death, and feeling it's \\"God's will\\" that she is royalty, and must represent her people? Which she does by being filthy rich, being waited on hand and foot, and having 40,000 acre estates. The queen finds out later, that the stag was killed, having \\"wandered\\" off the 40,000 acres to another estate, where a paying guest wounded him, then a servant had to finish  him off. She makes a visit the stag's decapitated body, however, it doesn't show her going to pay her respects to Di. Is the stag a substitute?<br /><br />What upsets the queen so much, is she can't believe that her people are making SUCH a fuss about Di's death, and that now 1 out of 4 have voted to abolish the monarchy. She feels as though she has given her life to these peasants, going around shaking hands with the poor, and they don't even appreciate it.  The queen believes that Great Britain was widely respected for its decorum in the face of tragedy, and that showing your emotions is simply not done.<br /><br />However, to prevent an uprising and perhaps losing her castle, she bitterly and against her better judgment gives in to Tony Blair's (who has gone to the other side and become her champion)advice, goes back to London, looks at some flowers that mourners have placed there, and takes very personally the hand-lettered notes (\\"your blood is on their hands\\"). Bummer.<br /><br />Well, it was all a very unpleasant affair, but now the Queen can go on about her business, without having to worry about Di causing any more headlines.to pay her respects to Di.

B00005JPC7|4.0|Although Stranger Than Fiction looked like it would be a successful enough comedy given the all-star cast, it started garnering the most praise for the bright and refreshing screenwriting brought on board by newcomer Zach Helm. Drawing comparisons to the brilliant mind behind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Charlie Kaufman, Zach Helm's script contains a similar philosophical bent and uncertain outlook on life that made Kaufman's works so incredibly popular. Director Marc Forster does an excellent job bringing the many quirks of Zach Helm's story to life and makes the best of his stellar cast. Will Ferrell again demonstrates why he is one of the most sought after actors in Hollywood giving the most serious performance of his career as obsessive-compulsive IRS agent Harold Crick. Maggie Gyllenhaal's excellent turn as Ana Pascal, the radical baker who becomes the object of Crick's affections, should definitely land her more leading roles and make her a star. Emma Thompson's Karen Eiffel, stuck with the moral conundrum of whether to kill off her main character who just happens to be real, and Dustin Hoffman's cold, reluctant scholar round out the cast and raise the film above the typical \\"supernatural\\" romantic comedy fodder. While the movie doesn't break any new ground per se, it provides a cinematic experience that is simultaneously contemplative and fun, able to tug at the audience's emotions to great effect without being heavy-handed or sappy. Stranger Than Fiction, with its pitch-perfect casting and touching story, provides a great launching platform for an imaginative, new screenwriting talent and effectively establishes Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal as serious talents to watch.
0140189378|4.0|<br />This thin novel is a joy to read because it is a bright study of a man who is vaguely tortured by his own circumstances of the \\"now.\\" The past haunts him.

B000IU3Y1O|4.0|Yes, there have been two singles collections from Mode out, and there is a single-disc version of this, without the music videos and the \\"short film\\" overview of DM. This is supposed to be a \\"best of,\\" although that's what makes it a slight disapponitment: They had good enough album cuts to appear on the compilation. \\"One Caress,\\" \\"Pimpf,\\" \\"Here Is the House,\\": Now THAT is the best of DM of the past 25 years. The only track I really felt they could have left out was \\"See You.\\" In spite showing that the band could have a hit without Vince Clarke and that they represent \\"A Broken Frame,\\" I find that track bland, and it isn't the best-aged of DM's songs. It seems, in this respect, more like a \\"greatest hits\\" compilation, as none of the songs from \\"Black Celebration\\" were included, and those only got to the top 30 in the UK and did nothing in the US. Still, the other 17 make it worth it; even though I never got into \\"Shake the Disease,\\" it's a fan favorite and deserves its place on here. That and the new \\"Martyr\\" are the only two tracks not to make a proper DM album (\\"STD\\" was single-only at the time). With the exception of four tracks on here (one new), everything else has been released on a Depeche Mode singles collection. It doesn't go in chronologic order like those two; it doesn't have to. Everyone needs some DM, so I don't mind this release. Warning to the new ones, though: You might get addicted & then buy everything with the band's name pretty much. <br />Case in point: Last year, of the studio albums, I just had \\"Violator\\" and \\"Playing the Angel.\\" I liked those two so much, I've ended up picking everything up, with the exception of 1983's \\"Construction Time Again\\" (which I may come around to getting).
0060512806|3.0|\\"Cryptonomicon\\" is entertaining and gripping at parts, and downright tedious at others. Stephenson makes a very obvious choice to go into far too much detail about the technical details of plot mechanisms to lend his novel extra geek cred--or maybe he thinks his audience actually enjoys that part (and, judging by the success of this book, he might just be right).  <br /> <br />But while some passages seem, every once in a while, to capture some element of human emotion, those parts are the exception rather than the rule; in general the characters are caricatures, the technology researched and plausible but, frequently, just slightly wrong (the educated reader might pick up on enough of a giveaway, every so often, to reveal that Stephenson is no expert on the technology he uses in his plots), and the descriptive passages tedious and long winded (a previous reviewer mentioned a scene in which the protagonist eats Captain Crunch cereal--suffice to say that that description drags on, in Hemmingway-esque detail, for pages).  <br /> <br />Perhaps I'm being overly suspicious, but all of Stephenson's twists--his unnecessary descriptions of cryptographic algorithms, his in-jokes (punning the name Linux as \\"Finux,\\" for instance), his long-winded lip service to Dungeons and Dragons--seem designed to ingratiate him with the \\"geek\\" crowd that is his intended audience. A reader of this persuasion may find these nods titillating, but he should also question whether this lip service is genuine, or if he is merely being pigeonholed by  Stephenson.  <br /> <br />This certainly isn't a bad novel. It's generally entertaining, good B-grade bedtime reading. But \\"the next Dickens,\\" to quote another Amazon reviewer, Neal Stephenson is not.
B0002W18MU|5.0|I know this is going to sound a bit dramatic but Johnny Cash's performance on this album is so good that many of the song almost brought me to tears. It was a bit embarrassing, because the first time I listened to the album I was at work sitting in my little cubical almost tearing up and one of my co-workers approached my to ask a question. I had to pull myself together quickly to answer their question so as not to look like a total boob. While most of these songs are covers Cash's renditions seem to infuse them with new feelings or feelings that they lacked in their original incarnations.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|My Chemical Romance seemed to come out of nowhere in 2005, despite the fact that the group had already released an album prior to the exceptional THREE CHEERS FOR SWEET REVENGE.  I don't think anyone expected its 2006 followup THE BLACK PARADE to trump it's predecessor.  However, that is exactly what THE BLACK PARADE did. As good as THREE CHEERS is, THE BLACK PARADE is that much better. My Chemical Romance sure \\"upped the anty\\" on this one.<br /><br />The album starts off with the \\"great temptation\\" track \\"The End.\\" which merely teases the listener with its short 1:52 duration.  It is unforturnate it is so short because it is definitely one of the strongest tracks on the album. The chord progression is immaculate.  It leads into the great track \\"Dead.\\" which features the band among their very best.  Gerard Way's voice is as strong and whiny as it ever has been here and the up-beat nature of the track is very much desired despite its dark, morbid ruminations. Specifically, the sick sound of the guitars truly stands out in the listener's mind as there is such a bluesy quality that only MCR possess in their guitar work. \\"This Is How I Disappear\\" is strong as well, but not as strong as \\"Dead.\\" It is very dark as well this time in a dark D minor key.  It doesn't feel to compell or allure the listener in the least.  Way's \\"screamo\\" vocal tendencies also work very well here.<br /><br />Skipping ahead, worth noting are a couple of other exceptional tracks that stand out amongst this very distinguished album.  First worth noting is the great \\"Welcome To The Black Parade\\".  This was the perfect single chosen to promote the album.  It has a different feel than any of the other tracks that MCR has released.  It doesn't have the same sound as \\"Helena\\", \\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\\", or \\"The Ghost of You\\", the hits from THREE CHEERS.  You can't help but to sing along when Way screams \\"carry on, carry on\\".  A five star performance by all means.<br /><br />\\"I Don't Love You\\" is another great track in the form of a power ballad, well in \\"screamo\\" form atleast.  The nice touch about the production of this track is the use of organ and near the very end electric piano.  Way sounds great, the band is \\"in the pocket\\" and the tracks stands alone very well. \\"Cancer\\" is perhaps my very favorite of the album. While the mood of the song is somber, morbid, and generally sad, the track is one of the most powerful, beautiful ballads I've heard for a while.  Everything about it is perfect and Way's whiny, gruff vocals add to the whole ambience of the track.<br /><br />\\"Mama\\" is another solid hit where Way sings \\"Moma, we all go to hell\\".  Despite the morbidity and the dark nature of the album, there is something enchanting, lilting, and drawing about it.  This is particularly evident when MCR barrels through the funnest track of THE BLACK PARADE, \\"Teenagers\\", where Gerard Way screams emphatically \\"teenagers scare the living s*** out of me\\".  Prior to the great \\"Teenagers\\", \\"Sleep\\" is another solid track with angular, \\"juicy\\" guitar lines and great, potent vocal performance by Way.<br /><br />Overall, THE BLACK PARADE is honestly one of the best albums that I've heard and bought in 2006.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  In fact, I personally think THE BLACK PARADE should be selling better than it is.  4 Stars for THE BLACK PARADE.s another great track in the form of a power ballad, well in \\"screamo\\" form atleast.

B00005JPCA|5.0|CASINO ROYALE is easily one of the best James Bond movies ever made.<br /><br />Not since Sean Connery has an actor boldly stepped into the role to put his personal stamp on it, bringing both charisma and brute force at the same time.  For all the Internet belly-aching about choosing Daniel Craig for 007, this has to be a major triumph for him.<br /><br />(Lazenby only did one.  Roger Moore took three films to establish himself.  Timothy Dalton never found Bond's sense of humor.  Pierce Brosnan also had an impressive debut...but then the stories ran dry after that).<br /><br />Everything worked in CASINO ROYALE for me and I've been a Bond fan for my entire life.<br /><br />I reread the original novel last week and appreciated how much of the story appeared in the film (for a change!), as well as the screenwriters' enhancements and developments.  An excellent job of adaption!<br /><br />Eva Green, who was so smokin' hot in THE DREAMERS, is much more than the usual eye candy.  The humor was restrained but pointed (\\"Your name is Stephanie Broadchest\\" is a great line) and the action close-quartered and tough.<br /><br />I plan on seeing it again and will definitely add it to my 007 DVD collection when it comes out.<br /><br />Bond blasts his way into the 21st Century!
B0006399FS|3.0|Now I have to admit, I've waited 2 years to finally give my review of this album.  But, now that I have had a chance to hear all the obscurities and B-sides, here is my take.  For a band that Bono self-professes has always been built around experimentation, this seems to be one of their most accessible albums to date.  In hearing some of the songs that were left off the album, in particular, Mercy, Fast Cars and Smile; it seems as though U2 could have done so much more.  Mercy is a 6 minute epic that rocks out like the old days!  Unfortunately, U2 chose to ommit these songs for a much more commercial approach.  I was very excited when Bono was telling everyone that U2 was going \\"old school\\" again.  While there are a few songs that demonstrate this such Vertigo, Miracle Drug, City of Blinding Lights, A Man and a Woman and Crumbs from your Table; the problem seems to be that there are not enough of them.  Therefore, I can only say this offering is average.  If your looking for something new and exciting, I would skip this and buy Wired Remorse's-The Ides of March.
B000IU3XTW|4.0|First of all, this is an all acoustic album recorded live in Hollywood.  What does that mean?  Fans of the Foo Fighters heavier songs, like me, could be disappointed... if not for Dave Grohl's voice, which is the real reason to listen to any Foo Fighters album. <br /> <br />1. \\"Razor\\" 2/10:  With a few exceptions (perhaps \\"Enough Space\\"), this is Foo Fighters worst song ever.  I don't know what possessed them to play it live.  Maybe they were trying not to get people's hopes up for the rest of the concert. <br />2. \\"Over and Out\\" 8/10:  A dramatic improvement over \\"Razor.\\"  Like much of the album, this sounds a lot better live than in the studio. <br />3. \\"Walking After You\\" 6/10:  It sounds better than the original, but I never really liked this song. <br />4. \\"Marigold\\" 10/10:  For those of you who have Nirvana's \\"With the Lights Out,\\" you know this song as a Nirvana B-Side.  The Foo Fighters version sounds a lot better. <br />5. \\"My Hero\\" 10/10:  If you listen carefully to \\"Marigold,\\" you can hear the riff to \\"My Hero.\\"  This song sounds different acoustically, not worse, not better, just different. <br />6. \\"Next Year\\" 6/10:  There are so many better songs they could have chosen from \\"There Is Nothing Left to Lose.\\"  An acoustic version of \\"M.I.A.\\" would've been a real treat. <br />7. \\"Another Round\\" 5/10:  Here's another song they really didn't need to play. <br />8. \\"Big Me\\" 8/10:  Footos anyone?  This is a nice take on the hit single, but it's still one of my least favorite songs from my favorite Foo Fighters album.  An acoustic version of \\"For All the Cows\\" would've been good, but as Dave mentions later, he was saving his voice. <br />9. \\"Cold Day in the Sun\\" 6/10:  Taylor is better off doing Jawbreaker covers. <br />10. \\"Skin and Bones\\" 6/10:  I have the B-Side.  Yes, this song is a B-side, rightfully so, not that Foo Fighters haven't put out some good B-Sides.  \\"Fraternity\\" and \\"Normal\\" are better than most of the songs they put on their albums. <br />11.\\"February Stars\\" 9/10:  Dave started writing this one while he was still with Nirvana.  I'm only giving it 9/10 because he didn't give it a good scream on \\"February Stars!\\" <br />12. \\"Times Like These\\" 5/10:  Big finish... big finish... I hate this song.  They should've done an acoustic version of \\"Halo,\\" but again, Dave was saving his voice. <br />13. \\"Friend of a Friend\\" 6/10:  It's a good song, but it doesn't sound any better live. <br />14. \\"Best of You\\" 10+/10:  Finally, we get to hear Dave belting it out.  You can barely hear the guitar, and that's the way it should be. <br />15. \\"Everlong\\" 6/10:  Every college kid with a guitar plays an acoustic version of this for his girlfriend.  I want to punch them all. <br /> <br />Overall, Foo Fighters fans have to own this album, but they'll be disappointed by the song selection. <br />
B000H7JD4A|5.0|I've read a lot of dumb reviews for this album.  One criticized the fact that many of the songs on here begin with a quiet sort of guitar or bass stumming and concluded that all the songs therefore sound the same (because the reviewer was too dumb to listen to each track for more than fifteen seconds).  Another said (and I quote), \\"After many sub-par albums and the horrors of Bruce's solo career, they're back.\\"  Firstly, what kind of idiot thinks sub-par is bad?  Anyone who's ever played golf knows that below par is a good thing, not that this has anything to do with music (and also ignoring the inaccuracy of the quote).  Secondly, there's not a single Iron Maiden fan alive who will tell you that Bruce's solo career was anything but \\"great\\" or \\"excellent.\\"  I seriously think that most of the people dishing out bad reviews are just punks who've heard Number of The Beast and think that makes them true fans.  Like the guy who wrote the \\"So You'd Like To\\" guide about Iron Maiden.  He's all too quick to tell us that the X Factor and Fear of the Dark tanked, but Dance of Death was awesome (anybody who has actually heard these albums knows better).    The truth is that 'A Matter of Life and Death' is Iron Maiden's best album in years, but that's not a direct slam against the band's other recent stuff, it's praise for this particular disc.  The fact that the band committed to playing the entire album live during this season's tour is a further testament to the strength of this material.  Of the band's last three albums, this is the best, but only because they have finally eschewed that copy and paste chorus construction that flawed BNW.  I'm tempted to say that 'A Matter of Life and Death' is Iron Maiden's best album since Somewhere In Time, but, I don't think you'd believe me.  Just buy it and listen to the music a few times.  Figure that out for yourself.  Just don't listen to reviewers who mark a star off their review because they were listening to the album through computer speakers.    Pros: Just as good as and better than anything Iron Maiden has put out since Seventh Son of A Seventh Son.  Heavier bass than the previous two albums.  Almost every song on 'A Matter of Life and Death' is epic, and there's only like one or two tracks that clock in at less than seven minutes.  Better lyric writing than Brave New World and Dance of Death.    Cons: It's no Powerslave Pt 2, if that's what you were expecting.  The band has changed their sound since that album and if you're the kind of person who thinks that a band should just recycle the same riffs and song structures over and over again with every album, then you may not 'get' this disc.    Conclusion: Buy this CD if you want proof that Iron Maiden are still great.
0373771665|5.0|VENETIA is one of my favorite books, reread over and over along with Heyer's THE GRAND SOPHY, THESE OLD SHADES, DEVIL'S CUB, THE MASQUERADERS and FALSE COLOURS.I don't dwell here on the plots. See other reviews for that.  I write to point out to today's writers (and readers) of Regency Romance the following:<br />**the main characters - witty, real, intelligent women and men who meet as equals and challenge each other in fascinating, often hilarious scenes on the way to a well-deserved happy ending; characters who come to life so throroughly that they seem like friends rather than fiction<br />**the secondary characters - brothers and sisters, neighbors, suitors, all fully developed and adding to the story<br />**the setting - a Regency world populated with people who think and talk and live their lives according to Regency standards<br />**the sizzle - astounding heat without a single PG-13 word; take VENETIA for instance - in recently published romances, a scene set in a hayloft would include lots of bare flesh, body fluids and cries of passion; Heyer packs a more powerful punch in a scene where the \\"friskest\\" characters are a basket of kittens.<br /><br />I don't necessarily call for a return to Heyer's G-rated times, but oh, how I wish that today's writers could ever approach the wit and wonder of these classics. If you haven't met Venetia and Dameral, Sophy and Charles, Justin and Leonie, Kit and Cressy, Prudence and Anthony - FIND THESE BOOKS and make these fabulous, fascinating folks your friends
B000089RV6|1.0|I never liked ACDC. Their music is just the same and sucks. BRIAN JOHNSON is as bad as BON SCOTT who just screams uses makeup and sells drugs. BACK in BLACK is a very lousy album which has the lousiest songs like the TITLE TRACK. DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF TRASH! GET FOREIGNER'S FOURTH ALBUM INSTED.
B0000A1RJI|3.0|This CD is not a bad buy. Not the best soundtrack I've had.  But it is okay. Ordered from Amazon.com.  The CD arrived in good shape.
B0000027RL|1.0|I can't stand one moment of Pearl Jam. They are very lousy and Vedder sings even more worse. Grunge is the worst most pathetic genre in the world. Ten is horrible, stay away from this as well as albums by GNR, Nirvana, and Pink Floyd. Don't listen to the 5 star reviewers, Peral jam are terrible whereas Foreigner are the greatest with a lovely song in Waiting For A Girl Like You. Avoid this and go with Foreigner 4 insted.
B00005V1B1|4.0|This 1974 followup to their eponymous debut is pretty darn good and shows the band developing themes introduced on the debut.  Simply, they took the shorter pieces on the debut and expanded them by inserting a lengthy ostinato played on the bass guitar atop which (fantastic) guitar and Hammond organ solos were layered.  These jam sessions are very exciting and both Andy Latimer and Pete simply rip.  The harder edged \\"hard rock\\" sounds on the debut seem to have been pared back a tiny bit, although there is plenty of rocking energy on Mirage.  The jazzier elements also become a little bit more pronounced on a few pieces.<br /><br />This album features the \\"classic\\" Camel lineup of Andrew Latimer (electric and acoustic guitars, flute, and vocals); Pete Bardens (Hammond organ, electric piano, acoustic piano, mini-moog, mellotron, and vocals; Doug Ferguson (electric bass); and Andy Ward (drums and percussion).  These guys are very good musicians and work well as an ensemble.  Andy and Doug form an especially tight rhythm section and Andy Latimer is a fantastic guitar player.  Although the vocals are not their strong suit, I do not mind them one bit and find that they work very well with the material.<br /><br />The five tracks on Mirage include a few shorter instrumental pieces in the 3-6 minutes range and two longer tracks in the 9-13 minute range that feature their particular approach to prog, which fused some jazz and classical influences with rock.  Of the longer pieces, I think Nimrodel works very well (love the mellotron playing), although I think that there is too much of an emphasis on riffs in Lady Fantasy, even though this is a pretty good track too.  My favorite instrumental track is Earthrise, which I consider to be representative of the quintessential Camel sound.<br /><br />This remastered package is very nice and features restored cover art along with loads of liner notes and band photos.  The sound quality is excellent. Along with the original tracks are live versions of Supertwister, Mystic Queen and Arubaluba (both from the debut) which were taken from a concert held at the Marquee Club on 10/30/1974; and a previously unreleased version of Lady Fantasy (it's an original mix).  The sound quality and performances of the live versions are excellent, while the original mix of Lady Fantasy does not seem too much different from the version included on the original album.<br /><br />All in all this is a great, high energy album of prog rock from Camel and is recommended.  The follow-up to Mirage would be their instrumental interpretation of the story The Snow Goose (1975), and would show them moving in an even softer direction.  Many folks feel that the excellent Snow Goose is their finest album and I agree.  Mirage and The Snow Goose are recommended along with Moonmadness (1976) which follows the format of Mirage, and the superb Rain Dances (1977), which features Richard Sinclair on bass and lead vocals.live versions of Supertwister, Mystic Queen and Arubaluba (both from the debut) which were taken from a concert held at the Marquee Club on 10/30/1974; and a previously unreleased version of Lady Fantasy (it's an original mix).

B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's 2nd album is a great album. But NOT best. THE BEST SONGS ARE TITLE, FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, FADE TO BLACK, and awesome instrumental closer CALL OF THE KTULU. Recommended along with all their albums except Killem All.
0783233477|4.0|Meet Joe Black is a re-make of Death Takes a Holiday, a 1934 film directed by Mitchell Leisen. This classic differs from the re-make in many respects, however, Joe Black, despite its length, (three hours) maintains its own particular magic. Though many critics praised Sir Anthony's performance, Brad Pitt as Joe Black carried the film.<br /><br />Similar to the original screenplay, Maxwell Anderson and Gladys Lehman's adaptation of the Italian play by Alberto Casella, the central idea of the Death Angel taking a small vacation to then fall in love with a beautiful woman remains the same.<br /><br />It is rare that Sir Anthony Hopkins ever gives a bad performance. He was wonderful in this film but Brad Pitt, forever trying to shed his pretty boy image, does a great job as an angel inhabiting a recently dead person's body with such innocence and believability, that expression in the eyes and his awkward movements, carried the film. It was only after seeing this film that my opinion of Brad Pitt's skill as an actor was revealed. There is an ethereal quality to his performance, a particular look in the eye that suspends all disbelief that he is the Angel of Death.<br /><br />Clare Forlani as Susan Parish is absolutely stunning and her beauty actually grows as the story progresses. The love scenes were exceptional, her expressions heart felt and overall performance, to my mind, outstanding.<br /><br />As many have said before, Meet Joe Black is a celebration of life, a reflection on a life well worth lived and the opportunity to contemplate life before its exit. Although the cynical might label this film sentimental, considering the subject matter, in my opinion, it is appropriate though, interestingly, without a hint of irony.<br /><br />The interesting outcome or climax of the film had a slight twist and seemed perfect for a movie of this kind.<br /><br />This is a film that can be watched again as its nuances and subtlety can be discovered over many viewings.<br /><br />A well acted and well produced film.wings.  <br /> <br />A well acted and well produced film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />

0385486804|4.0|This is the best of Krakauer's books to date and a wonderful exploration of the inner mind.  Krakauer's haunting prose really details his own efforts to understand the motivations and actions of a young man lost in the wilds of Alaska, and perhaps lost in his own identity and life.  Among other things Krakauer depicts himself in a very honest way as he projects his own fears and insecurities on the story's protaganist -- a foreshadowing of \\"there but for the grace of God go I\\" that comes home with special force in his writings on Everest in \\"Into Thin Air\\"

B0002OERI0|5.0|American Idiot was Green Day's best album. I think Billie Joe is talented and sings very clear and I think he's as talented as Foreigner's lead singer. Some of the best songs are Jesus Of Suburbia, and Holiday. I would highly recommend this and is better than any Peral Jam, AC/DC, GNR, Pink Floyd, and Nirvana album. Get this with albums from Foreigner, Dire Straits, Jimi Hendrix, Metallica who are equally good.
B000I5X81K|3.0|Okay, why the title (and one of the best) tracks \\"Awake\\" was omitted from the regular release is a huge mystery to me?  <br /> <br />Groban experiments on his latest CD with the likes of Herbie Hancock (\\"Machine\\"), Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Vusi Mahlasela (\\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Weeping.\\") Considering that Groban can sing the phonebook and hold your attention, these songs really don't work for him.  <br /> <br />\\"You are Loved\\" (Don't Give Up) is a gooey but catchy anthem and all the foreign language material is everything you would expect from Groban. The standouts from this his third release are \\"February Song\\" and \\"So She Dances.\\" These songs prove less is definitely better in vocal arrangement.  <br /> <br />In a shrewd marketing move, the best song, \\"Awake\\" is a bonus track relegated to a special edition CD/DVD release. It's worth the extra cash to buy this version and get this amazing song along with another track \\"Verita.\\"  <br /> <br />Groban is working hard to find his way into the mainstream music market.  His dedicated audience will appreciate this effort but \\"Awake\\" will do little to win over new fans.

That's not really a gut impression.  That's the impression I got hearing my wife say \\"That's not in the book...that's not in the book...\\"<br /><br />Actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling.  It makes for beautiful stills and pictures, and those made me want to see the movie.<br /><br />I expected a heart warming Christmas story, and what I got was about an hour of frantic scenes of out-of-control railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why I'm watching.  You get to see...<br /><br />A kid chasing a ticket through a train,<br /><br />A kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train,<br /><br />A ticket making its way through the forest -- Rube Goldberg style -- back to the train,<br /><br />(Forty minutes into this movie and one girl's train ticket is the star of the show!)<br /><br />OK, the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have...<br /><br />A train sliding out of control on the ice,<br /><br />A train trying to outrun cracks on the ice,<br /><br />A train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster (fans of the \\"coaster tycoon\\" series of computer games will feel right at home) until finally it arrives at the North Pole.<br /><br />Then, the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have...<br /><br />A train car running out of control through Santa's village,<br /><br />Kids getting lost in the Christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory, and then...<br /><br />Kids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to Santa's sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf.

0670038040|5.0|John Mortimer's \\"Rumpole and the Reign of Terror\\" brings back the champion of the underdog, Horace Rumpole, who is the oldest inhabitant of the chambers at 4 Equity Court.  With his trademark frayed gown and yellowing wig, Rumpole appears innocuous enough.  However, when he stands up in court, he has an arsenal of formidable weapons at his disposal:  a stentorian voice, biting wit laced with sarcasm, and devastatingly effective powers of cross-examination.  He frequently angers intrusive and overbearing judges, and he specializes in persuading lying witnesses to blurt out the truth.<br /><br />Refusing to retire from his beloved profession, Rumpole makes most of his living these days defending the Timson clan, whom he considers decent, non-violent criminals.  They engage in breaking and entering, burglary, and receipt of stolen property.  Unfortunately, Rumpole's relationship with the Timson clan quickly sours when he takes the case of a man accused of consorting with terrorists, Dr. Mahmood Khan.  Khan left Pakistan when his anti-government protests made him unwelcome in his native land.  He settled in England and married Tiffany Timson, whose family is none too happy with the match. The Timsons reluctantly withdraw their business from Rumpole when he agrees to represent Tiffany's husband.<br /><br />Khan's case makes Rumpole's blood boil.  The new terrorism laws allow the doctor to be imprisoned without knowing the specific charges against him.  In addition, Dr. Khan is presumed guilty until proven innocent, which leaves him with little legal recourse.  Rumpole defies his long-suffering wife, Hilda (She Who Must Be Obeyed), as well as his obnoxious and condescending Head of Chambers, Soapy Sam Ballard, both of whom urge him to drop the case.  On the contrary, Rumpole is determined to fight Dr. Khan's case to the finish, not just on its merits, but also because of its symbolic importance.  Rumpole is steadfast in his belief that it is his duty to safeguard  \\"civil rights ... and the basic principles of our criminal law.\\"<br /><br />\\"Rumpole and the Reign of Terror\\" is a small gem.  In fewer than two hundred pages, Mortimer writes a tidy mystery, and he also captures the spirit of our times.  We live in an age when elderly people like Rumpole are shunted aside as being out of step, when the fear of terrorism leads to abuse of human rights, and when racial prejudice infects cities populated by large numbers of immigrants.  Mortimer explores these and other themes with wit and effortless style.

In fewer than two hundred pages, Mortimer writes a tidy mystery, and he also captures the spirit of our times.  We live in an age when elderly people like Rumpole are shunted aside as being out of step, when the fear of terrorism leads to abuse of human rights, and when racial prejudice infects cities populated by large numbers of immigrants.  Mortimer explores these and other themes with wit and effortless style.

0307346609|2.0|Max Brooks has written a must-have history for Romero (or just Zombie) fans every where.  Unfortunately, while the story starts off strong, it soon dribbles into a series of disjointed and, occasionally, pointless vignettes.<br /><br />It would be a difficult tale for anyone to carry, given the format that Brooks has chosen to use: a large number of first person accounts of the near take over of the world by the stumbling zombie hordes.  There's no single narrative string for the audience to follow and no heroes with which the reader can identify.  I found myself eventually becoming bored with the different ways that Max's characters described the zombies - there's only so many ways to say \\"undead.\\"<br /><br />To make up for the essential sameness of the story line in every individual short story, Max begins to increasingly rely on overblown rhetoric.  For example, a chain-smoking military veteran, recovering in a psychiatric ward, breaks out of semi-literate street-slang to describe zombie heads popping like \\"Kristal corks.\\" Far from being effectively descriptive, it becomes a distraction that made me start looking for more examples of excessive hyperbole.<br /><br />I think the book would have held up better if, in addition to the large number of independent accounts, Max had found a way to weave a single unifying thread, giving his audience some one to root for and a reason to keep reading. A difficult, but not impossible task and Max Brooks appears to have the talent needed to pull such a task off; but the lack of heroes, or even characters most readers can identify with, makes this a book with no compelling reason to finish.  You can stop on one page, flip at random through the book, start reading again and never feel like you've lost your place.<br /><br />And speaking of heroes - this is really a minor complaint, but once you've figured it out it begins to annoy - Max's characters are all of a type: a PC type.<br /><br />That is, such heroes as the various stories allow, are divided into sympathetic and non-sympathetic groupings.  The sympathetic, most effective, characters are all minorities, women, or handicapped.  The non-sympathetic, least effective, characters are all white and male.  His bias goes so far that there's not a single heroic cop, survivalist NRA member, or even effective military unit.  The president of the United States (sympathetic-minority) is contrasted against the vice-president (unsympathetic-white) by citing many instances of the great president's wise guidance, while the vice president is simply described as \\"the wacko.\\"<br /><br />I'm not saying that it's impossible for the world to be saved by any particular group.  It's Max's book and he can take the tale where ever he wants.  But it's so transparently obvious a bias that, once you figure it out, you find yourself mentally forecasting the characters entirely independently of their stories.  It's a stretch and distracts from what could have been a more balanced (and more interesting) tale as a result.<br /><br />All that said, I started out by saying that tome is a \\"must-have\\" for Romero loving Dead-heads like me and I stand by that statement. For all it's rambling plot and hyper-kinetic speech, it's still the best new installment in the zombie pantheon for many a day.  I predict great success in it's admittedly limited demographic.s the various stories allow, are divided into sympathetic and non-sympathetic groupings.

B000I5X81A|5.0|Saw Clapton interviewed on CBS Sunday Morning on 11/08.  Clapton told the interviewer that, as much as he regrets to admit, he just can't do some of those things he used to be able to do on the guitar.  More and more, Clapton is truly becoming \\"Slowhand.\\"  For the past several of his albums, that really bothered me.  He seemed not only to be slowing down (hey, the man's in his sixties) but he also seemed to be writing songs just to fill up space.  But, here, on this CD with his friend J. J. Cale as his musical mentor, Clapton's guitar work is stellar.  Here, the \\"Slowhand\\" appelation is certainly appropriate, but there's a feeling here that Clapton has also found a new interest in his own playing.  The songs are mostly Cale's and they're great stuff, but what's nice is how fresh and energized and interested Clapton sounds.  By the way, have you seen the DVD of Clapton's Crossroad's Guitar Festival; it'll blow you away.
0446577383|4.0|Although some of the dialogue is rather shallow, I really enjoyed reading this story.  Yes, he is a little preachy, and having senior staff in the department of homeland security neatly sum up the geo-political environment for the reader is rather annoying.  Yet I had a very good time reading this story.  I enjoyed the romantic tension between Alex Ford and Kate Adams, and I was very excited by the prospect of a certain someone having a family reunion with a child thought dead.  Balducci is excellent at controlling pace and keeping lots of variety and tension up in the air.  When a book is that well paced, it's easy to overlook some incredible dialogue.  The accent of the Russian Adelphia was terrible, but oh well.  This is the first Baldacci book I've read, and when I'm ready for moderately smart, somewhat unrealistic but exciting fiction, I'll definitely read him again--especially while on travel.  <br /> <br /> I've lived in the DC area five years, and his geography's a little incredible--particulary one afternoon where the club strolls from the Smithsonian metro to the FDR monument but still not finding privacy there, ends up at Stone's \\"home\\" so they can chat.  That's a trip that would take all day and night (let alone an afternoon walk).  DC's like Las Vegas...objects appear much closer than they actually are.  I really don't expect a life altering or profound experience when I pick up a thriller.  As such, it had great action and thought-provoking \\"fictional facts\\" about modern anti-terrorism and espionage, in general.  It made me really want to visit the Library of Congress.
0743289412|1.0|This was my first experience with Stephen King and I made it to page 150 before I quit.  It was agonizingly slow and it just wasn't my cup of tea.  I told myself that I would quit at page 100 if it didn't seem to go somewhere but I gave it another 50 pages because it was Stephen King.  It was brutal.
B00005RDRO|4.0|Neil Simon'w MURDER BY DEATH succeeds mainly because of the talented actors who bring a lot to roles that aren't that cleverly written.  Simon's script pays homage to great detectives like Nick and Nora Charles, Hercule Poirot, Sam Spade, Charlie Chan, and Jane Marples.  As embodied by this stellar cast, the caricatures are occasionally hilarious but always enjoyable.<br /><br />The world's greatest detectives are invited to the estate of Lionel Twain (Truman Capote in his film debut, who is quite funny and effective) to solve a gruesome murder.  We have David Niven and Maggie Smith as Dick and Nora Charleston, the glamorous duo; Peter Falk as Columbo playing Sam Diamond, who as always is fine; Eileen Brennan is his sexy assistant and girlfriend; the inimitable Peter Sellers is Wang, the oriental sleuth; Elsa Lanchester plays Miss Marbles and James Coco is Frenchy Perrier, who is very funny too.  The supporting cast is effectively rounded out by Estelle Winwood as Marbles' invalid nurse; Nancy Walker as the deaf and dumb cook; James Cromwell as Perriers fussy valet, Richard Narita as Wang's adopted Japanese son, and the scene stealing Alec Guinness as the blind butler.<br /><br />It's all corny but thoroughly enjoyable to watch these gifted actors grace the screen.
B000FSME1A|1.0|Yeah - it's a bummer that they didn't include Hearts of Darkness, but putting Redux and the original together was irresistable (although I much prefer the original). <br />I was ENRAGED that some idiot decided to put half of each movie on 1 disc, instead of the original on one and Redux on the other. <br />All I can say is - WTF!!! <br />If you prefer to sit back to enjoy films in their entirety, do yourself a favor and don't buy The Complete Dossier.  <br />It's such a shame too, the packaging was insanely cool.
B00005JPCA|5.0|Decades from now when people look back on the long-running cadre of Bond films this one will be among the top 5 all-time --- trust me. Daniel Craig gives a new spin to the tried and true 007 formula of non-stop action, beautiful women and international intrigue. His looks and laconic screen presence reminded me alot of Steve McQueen. It's almost as if Bond is being introduced for the first time because we get a real psychological insight into what makes this famous master spy tick. This is masterfully accomplished by action packed harrowing scenes including one torture scene that would make even Quentin Tarrantino blush. This is fitting since 'Casino Royale' was the book by Ian Fleming that first introduced the world to 007. The plot centers around a terrorist ring financed by a very deadly international financier called Le Chiffre. Bond must beat him in hold-em poker at a game where the buy-in is $10 million dollars and the prize is $150 million. Victory for Le Chiffre would mean money in the pockets of terrorists and as usual victory for Bond means saving the world. Of course, as with all Bond films, it's the 2 hours and 24 minutes of getting there that's all the fun --- 'Casino Royale' is licensed to thrill!!!    <br />
0307346609|4.0|Pretty good riff on Studs Terkel's \\"The Good War\\" (he's even thanked)adds biting undead to the equation. Max Brooks' book shouldn't be as good as it is. It is a pretty good page turner, with interesting people, still somewhat disbelieving, just coming out of their shock and grief to tell the story of their part in the battle for humanity. The structure of the book is strong and the shape of the war becomes clear as different narrators step up to have their say. Unfortunately, the time line is a little, um, wobbly at the end as a book which starts in the near future- just past 2007- ends up several years later showing cultural time markers of it being the late 1980s or early 1990s- probably when Max Brooks was in college and, not having a child yet still had time to pay attention to cultural signifiers. Still, these are the things that raise a book from a fun, trashy read- which \\"World War Z\\" definitely is- to a level of Art, which it, quite simply, ain't.
B000FGGE68|1.0|This movie sucks.  Absolutely NO gore with battle scenes, the plot was incredibly weak and Milla J. looked about 45 in this flick.  The movie certainly did not present her in the best light.  Reading several reviews, I think people actually missed the real plot.  Unfortunately, for those who missed the real plot, you have to watch it again.  I feel for you.  There goes 90 minutes of my life I will never get back.  The only good thing about the movie were the graphics.  Other than that, no other reason to watch it.  SKIP IT!!!!!!
B00005JOCT|5.0|I have been waiting for \\"Dreamgirls\\" to be made into a movie since I originally saw the stage production in 1981 and now 25 years later, it has finally happened. It was well worth the wait. I was lucky enough to be invited to a pre screening here in NY on 11/15 and I must say the film is SENSATIONAL. Bill Condon has done a masterful job of adapting this Broadway classic to the screen. On stage, \\"Dreamgirls\\" is more of an operetta than a traditional musical much like \\"Evita\\". A lot of the dialogue is sung rather than spoken so what works on a Broadway stage is very difficult to translate to film. What Condon has done is to change this so it is more dialogue than song so it is more believable on film. The original \\"Dreamgirls\\" from the stage version (Sheryl Lee Ralph, Loretta Devine and of course the incomparable Jennifer Holiday) were incredible but the new \\"Dreamgirls\\" are just as incredible. Beyonce will surprise you with her acting chops. This is the first role she has had where she can really show how she has grown as an actress. Her Deena Jones goes from a naive young girl to a confident woman and the transformation is completely believable. She is also given her own song \\"Listen\\" in the second half of the film that conveys that she does not want to be manipulated anymore and is very much her own woman now. Anika Noni Rose in the Lorrell role was a complete surprise. She does a wonderful job in the movie. Anyone familiar with the show knows that the Effie White character is the center of the show. If your Effie is not good, the show will fall apart. Well, the news is that Jennifer Hudson as Effie White is a revelation. Think Barbra Streisand's movie debut in \\"Funny Girl\\" because just as stunning as that performance was is Jennifer Hudson's performance in \\"Dreamgirls\\". Sassy, sexy, heartbreaking and ultimately triumpant, Hudson's performance is unbelievable. I defy you not to break out in unsustained appaulse at the end of her performance of \\"And I Am Telling You, I'm Not Going\\". I smell an Oscar! Now for the men of \\"Dreamgirls\\". Jamie Foxx does a very good job as Curtis Taylor Jr. He is sneaky, sleazy and manipulative and his singing is on point. The big surprise here is Eddie Murphy. What a performance! He is singing and dancing up a storm as James Thunder Early in an alternately comedic and dramatic performance that I did not know he had in him. The smaller roles are cast well also. Danny Glover as Marty Madison and Keith Robinson as CC White turn in some very nice performances here. Did I love the film? You betcha. Am I going to see it again? Most definitely.
068987474X|4.0|Some of the reviews I've read so far are very accurate. This is a fun, fast paced and commical read but its not without flaws. One, for instance is the premise that all guys are hard wired the same. This notion is ridiculous. Chasing partners is fun and I understand all the reasons men do it but when their ready for something real guys are just as likely to stop playing games as women are. Pushing away a perspective mate isn't what their going for anymore then looking desperate is what women intend. Also, this is a new era and men appreciate a woman who isn't afraid to say, 'Look, I think your kinda cute wanna dance, grab a drink, have coffee ect'. I have the misfortune of being such an agressor, thank goodness I'm married, but still I have yet to meet a man who didn't appreciate a womans ability to say 'this is what i want, you gonna give it to me or not'. It does not make a women needy or desperate because chances are when she's gotten what she's wanted she'll back off and let him make the next move.If he doesnt she may wonder why, or even ask but again I don't think this makes her desperate. It makes her curious. His answer isn't likely to change her life or even make her feel like less of a catch. Its an answer not a revelation. In closing I'll say this, 'He's just not that into you' is a wake up call and a much needed one if I do say so myself but not everything written here is LAW. Sometimes a reason isn't an excuse its exactly that. A reason. An explanation. And other times its the other way around. The trick is letting your instincts interpt the message for what it really is instead of glossing it all over. Which is basically what this book tells you to stop doing. The message is good, the read is fun. It's not a bad way to waste a couple of hours but if your gonna latch onto this thing like its the bible you've got bigger issues then weather he's just not into you!
B000IU3Y3W|4.0|With this release, the first from Neil's infamous \\"Archives\\", comes a all-too brief glimpse of the original Crazy Horse sound captured at full force, with the late Danny Whitten, at the legendary NYC venue in March, 1970.  <br />While the nearly 20 minute long rendition of \\"Cowgirl In The Sand\\" has already attained legendary status, there is also a well played extended take of \\"Down By The River\\" included in this set. The two songs together elevate the overall package \\"just enough\\" for the avid Neil collector to throw their money down, but probably don't add up to enough for the casual Neil fan to do the same this time around. The historical significance of Whitten and Young leading the Horse with such power and electricity will be lost on the less enthusiastic Neil fans out there. But make no mistake about it, this is the way these songs were meant to be played and heard by the world. So if that's important to you, then this becomes a must-have CD (especially in the nice hi-resolution stereo mix of the DVD...turn it up to 11 and enjoy a Crazy Horse show right in your own house!) <br />As has already been stated and commented on in abundance on this site and many others, as well as all over the rock music world, Neil's choices of what to leave in/what to leave out, ultimately leave his fans really scratching our heads and \\"Wonderin\\". But then, what's new? I'm not one to say that \\"Winterlong\\", \\"Wonderin\\" or \\"Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown\\" are less deserving of inclusion than the omitted songs (\\"The Loner\\", \\"Cinnamon Girl\\", the entire acoustic set, etc etc), but those longtime fan favorites not making the cut of a 44 minute CD is baffling to say the least. Ideally, this would've been the full electric Horse set on one CD, and the entire solo acoustic set on antoher CD to make this one heck of a double-disc package and a phenomenal introduction to the vaults. <br />But alas, we'll take what we can get and patiently wait for more. Lord knows Neil has taught his fans athing or two about patience (and head scratching). <br />
0689870280|4.0|Another great little text by Boynton. As usual her witty prose and simple but engaging illustrations are a delight to read and my children always enjoy. <br /> <br />One small annoyance, the book shows animals exercising right before bedtime. After reading my children want to do exercise activity and this gets them a little wound up making bed time a bit extra challenging. My solution is to read that book first, then read another more sedate themed book to help the children settle down again.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|When the scientific facts about climate change are seriously looked into the only inconvenient truth is Vice President Gore needs to find another celebrity cause.  A passionate speaker can sway many people that are already leaning towards a given theory.  It quickly becomes evident that once the predicted ice age of the late '70s and early '80s didn't pan out the only direction to go was the opposite or global warming. What should cause most people to pause and think is that when the noise dies down the only solution to global warming given by it's theorists is to vote for a certain political party.  Sorry, nice try Al. Perhaps if you spent more time cleaning up the heavy metal pollution found on your own property you would convince more people.
1594200653|5.0|Tony Judt's  \\"Postwar - A History of Europe Since 1945\\" is a 5-strar book of well researched material written by a British conservative born 1948 in London  and educated at Cambridge and Paris. The book paints the political, social and economic spectrum in Europe from West to East following World War II.<br /><br />Steeped in information about little understood East European countries, the book is a great read for non-Europeans interested in knowing how the countries of Europe recovered from the war, especially East Germany, the Balkans, and the other Eastern Europe countries which were strongly influenced by the USSR.<br /><br />The book makes the point, that without the threat of the USSR in Eastern Europe, the US isolationist advocates might have prevailed, which would have adversely influenced the recovery of West Germany - and Communism might not have collapsed so quickly.<br /><br />The book is relatively easy to read because its 800 plus pages are peppered with insights that maintain the reader's interest.
B000059XUO|5.0|Personally  i think this movie is fantastic.It should not have 41/2 stars.I think it should have 5.I know they have made many crow movies.But this is one of those kinds of movies that you can not make sequel for.It could never be compaired to any movie.the action the romance but also the tradgedy.Only certain movies can have that emotion that when you watch it,it affects you.It was also tradgic that Brandon Lee died while making this movie.It is and amazing film.And i recomand that you give it a 5.
B000063JDE|3.0|Blue Velvet<br /><br />This is a beautiful movie, set up like a stone in a setting by director David Lynch's trademark eccentric lighting. The photography and the sets are gorgeous; the mix of symbols and refernces and visual styles was daring in its time and the whole experience of seeing it is as much the unrolling of a scroll as it is of watching a movie.<br /><br />The story looks like a William S. Burroughs adaptation of a Hardy Boys mystery. A coupla teenagers stumble on a mystery and, gee whiz, they deced to solve it. Instead of buried treasure, it involves electronically amflified sadists crazed by brain-implanted drugs and wearing leather, velvet, lace and rubber fetish suits. There's an occasional mutilated corpse thrown in.<br /><br />At its release in 1987, Blue Velvet and its creator were unexpected surpises from a Hollywood where the scripts seem to be generated by a computer that watches a lot of television. Today, the movie seems a bit full of itself, (recurring shots of a symbolic flame), and the plot seems less satisfying. The world of horrors that's revealed in the first part of the film is resolved rather stupidly at the end.<br /><br />Isalbella Rossellini made her career with a lush performance in this movie and Dennis Hopper remade his. The rest of the cast seems weirdly restrained: hard to tell if by director's choice or just wooden acting.<br /><br />Still, this was a movie that changed the expectaitons we have of movies and it's well worth seeing.<br /><br />--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE and the forthcoming novel bang-BANG from Kunati Books.

0375831002|5.0|Death can hardly be a reliable narrator. neither can Death be warm and fuzzy and heartbreakingly earnest. Death can hardly be a funny and loving narrator. that will not do, will it? but that is just what markus zusak's narrator does in his tender tale of growing up, loving books and finding oneself, all in the heartless world of nazi germany.   <br />Liesel Meminger, a 9 year old girl and her brother, 6 are sent by their mother to live with foster parents, but on the way tragedy strikes and the young boy dies, the mother lost but the young girl forges on, picking up the one thing lying next to her dying brother, a book. the first stolen book, by an illiterate young girl. At her new parents' place, a seemingly gruff brutish mother who adoringly calls her saukerl (swine) and a gentle accordion player, dreamer of a father, Liesel clings on to life, goes to a school and makes friends with the roguishly charming Rudi Steiner, a boy arrogant and stupid enough to apply coal allover his face in the midst of swirling Aryan pride and pretend to be Jesse Owens as he runs like the wind.   <br />Their blissfully innocent childhood is slowly threatened by the jingoistic bigotist nazis and he sudden arrival of a jew who must be hidden in liesel's basement. There are few unpredictable moments in the narrative, forewarned as we are by Death's announcements at the beginning of the chapter (he doesn't like twists and nasty surprises for they are cheap and vulgar), so right at the beginning of the chapter you will know who dies, lives and does what. Death knows that it is not what happens but how that makes a story.  <br />The Book Thief has its false moments, yes this book is a bit too melodramatic, a bit too doe-eyed. It is far too earnest a story but Liesel is an admirable heroine, one we will love and cherish. Death is the kind of narrator you will choose for your own biography, He is warm and tender and hates his job (\\"War is like a new boss, always expecting the impossible\\"). Liesel's parents are the kind of loving couple that we all wish we knew. Rudi is the friend we all want to be.  <br /> <br />But what it all comes down to is this: It's hard not to fall madly in love with a book that earnestly believes in the redemptive quality of books.
B00005JPAD|2.0|Two guys played by Matt Damon (Sullivan) and Leonardo DiCaprio (Costigan) embark on mirror-image spy careers. One is a mobster pretending to be a cop; the other is a cop pretending to be a mobster. Since the actors look annoyingly similar to me, I had trouble at first sorting things out. <br /> <br />Jack Nicholson (Costello) plays basically the same dirty-minded old grouch in every movie nowadays, so he at least was no puzzle (though he did show something new in this movie, come to think of it). Same thing with Martin Sheen (Queenan), who channeled \\"West Wing's\\" Josiah Bartlett for this movie. Maybe recycling characters saves rehearsal time? Mark Wahlberg played a nasty, sarcastic, snarky guy named Dignam who was in almost every scene with Martin Sheen, maybe to cancel out all that Josiah Bartlett niceness. He did everything but perch on Queenan's left shoulder wearing horns and a pitchfork. <br /> <br />To keep the female viewer's interest, there was a \\"love triangle\\" aspect with a ditzy female therapist who fell for both Sullivan and Costigan. Maybe she couldn't tell them apart any better than I could. A good twenty minutes could've been shaved off the movie if only she'd been able to beg, borrow or steal a clue in the romance department. Both of these guys were Bad Choices. Didn't she learn anything in therapist school? <br /> <br />I didn't like any of the characters enough to care what happened to them, and was thus bored for most of the movie. I nearly gave myself tennis elbow from checking my watch. <br /> <br />So now I wonder why so many people gave this 5 stars. Was it the shock value? Well, there was a lot of skull cracking and blood spattering. Haven't we seen enough of that yet? Lots of foul language, but they're going to have to get truly creative to shock people with that anymore. There was one truly revolting glimpse of Costello in a porn theater that fell squarely into the \\"shocking\\" department, I guess. No, I think what really makes this a work ofgenius is its message: There's not much difference between good and evil anyway, and life is short. Better get while the gettin's good. <br /> <br />That's such an important message to hammer home to people nowadays, especially young people. Through the magic of DVDs, every teenager can watch this movie over and over again until that life philosophy is burned into his psyche. And they will. Thank you, Martin Scorsese!
B00005JPCD|5.0|I saw previews for this movie and thought it was cute.  I was like, Oh yeah, I will have to see this movie.  I did not know that the movie would be THIS good, though.  I thought, 'yeah, it'll be a cute, funny movie without much substance in it.'  WRONG.  This movie is not only funny, it has substance.  It has a strong message to it about accepting others (somehow recently things keep crossing my path that send that strong message.)  Basically, in the movie, a Penguin is an outcast because he can not sing.  His special talent is tap dancing. Well, I don't want to spoil the end of the movie, but Mumble's tap dancing plays an important role in the movie as you will see when you watch it.  When you watch this movie, you will realize that outcasts are not bad.  You might even learn a valuable lesson about reaching out to people and accepting people who may be different than you are.  Who knows why they might be different?  Maybe they were born that way.  Sometimes people who are different have out-of-the box ideas that you may not even have thought of.  What I have to say to you is that just because you are different does not mean that you are still not good.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone of all ages and I hope they will not only make a sequel to this movie but make many others similar to this.   <br /> <br />*PG-Mild frightening scenes <br /> <br />I personally think certain scenes in the movie may be frightening to those 4 and under.  (There is one sudden scene where a leopard seal jumps out and tries to attack Mumble, which could be pretty unnerving since it is so sudden.) <br /> <br />Other than that, I find this to be a very good family movie worth paying theater price for (I paid night theater price for it, and it was worth it.)  I will probably purchase this when it becomes available on DVD. <br />
B000GI3KHQ|1.0|I wrote this first as a comment, now I re-write as a review. <br /> <br />Based on the other reviews here on Amazon, I will wait for a true studio version in widescreen to be released.  I share all the other comments in that it is an absolute insult to a milestone of cinematic history not to have this gem properly available to the public.  The use of this film in education, in reminding our own government and to the wisdom of people in general is beyond that of nearly any other film I can think of.  I can only hope that someone who cares deeply about the legacy of such masterpieces, and who has the resources, can pick up the DVD rights and produce a product worthy of it's content.  (Ted Turner / Turner Classic Movies perhaps?  Possibly one of the academic institutions committed to cinematic history can get involved, or maybe even Bill Gates and his interest in digitally documenting history...) <br /> <br />Does anyone currently owning this basic, standard format DVD have the studio information that produced it?  I guess they hold the ticket on Billy Budd.  I can only hope that information can be posted here in another review so that we can all let them know directly how we feel and what the market clearly wants.  Can someone please post that? <br /> <br />Thanks and ever hopefull, - tbrownusa

B000E41MS6|5.0|At first I had a hard time getting used to the new Doctor, having such a fondness for Tom Baker.  I soon fell in love with the whole show, however.  I find the interaction of Rose with the characters from different times interesting; it's more personal and engaging than the older series.  More suspensful, too.  The fact that the film makers kept most of the series Earth-related is slightly disappointing, but I think it was because of both budget and visual considerations.  It adds something to the show to have a lot of outdoor shots and not just studio scenes; it makes it more easy to relate to.  Overall, I think it's fantastic!
B000J4QWMC|1.0|I grew up with the ORIGINAL Miami Vice series. I've am a bigtime action adventure affectionado. This movie just missed the boat. I didn't find myself being drawn into a story at all. I didn't FEEL like this was an action/adventure movie - just 2 actors getting a paycheck and showing some skin so the fans don't feel thoroughly jipped.    I don't see how they couldn't feel ripped off! Hey, I like Jamie and Colin. But...C'mon guys...you gotta pick stuff that is worthy of the work you've already done.    If I was in a movie theater, I would have walked out LONG before this diatribe finished. I couldn't have tortured myself with trying to watch it there. However I had it BEAMED into my hotel room at a PREMIUM - so, I already had wasted the money...so I kept looking for one sliver of a redeeming quality to this movie. I couldn't find one.    Why make Cockett's character LOOK like he did? I didn't get that.    Why the gratutious sex scenes (yes, multiple)? Neither character NEEDED the sex scenes where they were placed - and Rico's was what - extended just to fill up the time, to try to detract from the LACK of a well written script?    STEALTH was much better than this (and it didn't gross well).    I was thoroughly BORED with this movie. I anticipated that it would be bad, but not THIS bad.    Save your money and the aggravation of watching this. Otherwise you'll just end up saying I told you so.
B000HZGCEG|5.0|I thought this movie was very good. I love the Middle Ages time era, and the things that made this movie good was the fact that it had some history in it. Plus, I liked the way they showed that there were certain problems with traveling back and forth through time. And how at a certain point you won't be able to get back home:( Then, too the end of the movie with Maverick and Lady Claire buried in the tomb stone HE was actually digging up himself. It makes you wonder who would've been there in his place if he kept digging?
B000J10ERO|4.0|This movie was enjoyable and screenplay did not suffer from a rehash of the usual Superman/Lois antics.    I liked the twists - there were several.    However I was disappointed that the talents of Kevin Spacey seemed more than a little under-utilized in this movie. I kept saying - is that all? He could have been much better used as Lex - the script just didn't do his talent any justice.    There were several questions that just weren't answered - oh well, maybe that will be for the next movie.    The movie could have been shortened by what, 10 minutes, maybe 15 with a different edit. But moved fairly well. You will not be disappointed viewing it on your TV or computer screen.
B000F48CD8|5.0|I have to say I read some of the bad reviews on here and I can't really figure out what they think is good music. Seems like some of them just want to cause a backlash against Jack White or they just hate him altogether. This is not a Top 40 album it is a throwback album to yes the 70's but it is one of the best songwriting albums released this year. They are heavily influenced by The Beatles in their harmonies and there is not a weak song on this album. Is it The White Stripes not really although Level sounds a lot like them. Really want to see them live and I have ordered some of their official live bootlegs from their recent European tour. Great album and hope to see them around for a while.
B000002KDS|5.0|I would have to put Killer right up there at the top of all time best Albums ever.  It is Alice at his most insane.  I would agree with alot of people and say this would be the album to buy for someone who has never heard any of Alice Cooper's music.  Then I would tell them to buy these other Cooper albums in order: <br /> <br />Billion Dollar Babies <br />Love it to Death <br />School's Out <br />Welcome to my Nightmare <br />AC Goes to Hell <br />From the Inside <br />Muscle of Love <br />Trash <br />(Some of the newer albums) <br />then I would explain to them about albums like Flush the fashion up to Raise your fist and Yell.  The first two albums and Lace and Whiskey. <br />
B00007G207|1.0|Do we need additional background?  Do we have to see Salvatore nail an old, fat, greasy prostitute on the sticky theatre floor?  This image, among a few others, left me sickened.  Before this, I felt the magic, the innocence of first love, and I'm sure others did, too.  Why does anyone ever assume that shattering that original illusion is a good idea?  I'll tell you.  It was time to milk the old cow again for a few bucks.  If you're anything like me, here's a bit of sage advice:  Whenever you see a \\"Director's Cut\\" or \\"The New Version\\" of one of your intensely favorite films, leave it where you found it.  There are reasons for scenes being cut -- and they aren't all about shortening a film's length.  Many of them are scenes that do little or nothing to help the plot, reveal character, or move the story forward, and they were subsequently removed by professional editors (and many times by the director himself).  I challenge you to test this.  If you see a so-called \\"new\\" version of an old classic, and you can't figure out why the gratuitous sex and/or brutality have been added, I'm pretty sure that you'll be able to deduce the real reason.  The original version of this film left us haunted, entranced, and enchanted.  That was an illusion that I, as a screenwriter, was quite content with.  I enjoyed that bittersweet resonance.  Now, this wonderful film has been ruined for me.  Another enchanting film that was thoroughly trashed by it's director's cut is \\"The Big Blue.\\"  If you haven't seen the god-awful director's cut, for Pete's sake, don't do it to yourself.  If you do, I promise you, you'll destroy that delicate framework that the film took such painstaking efforts to weave together.  Why don't we paint a moustache on the Mona Lisa?  DUH!
B0000028PI|4.0|I will have to disagree with other reviews on this album yes it is the best from the 90's for Alice but far from being a Classic.  The first two songs are corny almost like he is trying to sound like Department of Youth off of Welcome to my nightmare.  From Lost in America and on it is very good so I still give it 4 stars.  You're My Temptation is the best song on Album by far.
0743442539|5.0|I heard this book touted at a writer's conference as the best spy novel ever written--so naturally, being the bookworm I am, I bought it. Three chapters in, I was fascinated, but rediculously confused. But I continued reading, because while I had no idea what was going on, I could tell that it was obviously sleight of hand by the author and not lack of skill.     This isn't the most accessible novel or even easy to understand, but it is definitely good, and at times, flat out brilliant as the layers of the plot get thicker and thicker and the intensity ratchets higher and higher. It is also worth mentioning that I would not usually expect a book like this to have the heart that it does--I found simple love story between Leamas and Liz quite beautiful, and the the strong, forceful ideas of the next to last chapter chillingly satisfying.
B00005O3VC|5.0|King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table set out on a quest to find the Holy Grail...as told to do so by a cartoon God that lives in the clouds...<br /><br />Easily the most hilarious and original comedy ever made, Monty Python and the Holy Grail claims it's undisputed throne through insanely ridiculous situations and characters that will very likely never be duplicated. Pure comedic genius that doesn't go stale with age or decades of competition having been released. Simply seeing the way comedy films are made today, this film will very likely have a long reign before anything can even hold a candle to it. An absolute belly-laugh fest that never lets up.<br /><br />Only the cast of Monty Python could have pulled this film off, with each actor playing many different characters...all hilarious! The genius in the actors' lines themselves are truly to be admired. The comedic style of talking in circles is one technique that most comedies do not try to do, simply because they can't compete with the genius of this film, which uses it flawlessly. Those that do try usually fall flat on their faces. Two particularly excellent examples of this can be seen in the beginning scene, in which the characters discuss the origins of coconuts.....and the other when Lancelot breaks into the swamp castle to save the \\"damsel in distress.\\" This is merely one technique that the cast has perfected to conjure up laughs consistently throughout the entire film. The only way that I can imagine that someone might not like this film is if they simply do not enjoy it's type of humor. Too bad for them.<br /><br />Another hilarious technique used in the film is the use of comedy in the background. From people slamming cats against poles for no apparent reason, to people filling up baskets with mud in the fields....all very strange and hilarious at the same time. It's also simply amazing that all of the characters are played by the same group of actors, which shows the great range all of them have. Some are simply unrecognizable from one character to the other and it sometimes takes a good eye to pick them out, which makes it fun. And I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but this film takes some turns that no sane person could see coming.<br /><br />Ridiculous characters in ridiculous situations equals ridiculous laughter.<br /><br />The epitome of all-star comedy that will no doubt continue to stand the test of time. Kudos to Gilliam and the rest of the Python crew. If you haven't seen it yet, make it your first priority in life!f them have.

B000J103WA|5.0|Superior HD transfer- the standard def edition was very good, but this new high definition version trumps it handily in every way- superior color, detail, etc- <br /> <br />An absolute feast for the eyes and ears- highly recommended!
B000FA57N0|5.0|The HD version of this movie is spectacular. Visuals are stunning. The story moves quickly and the characters come to life right before your eyes. I'm wasn't an original fan of Firefly but I am new, like most of you, to HD DVD. I'm blown away at how cool this movie is and how good it looks.  <br /> <br />I found the extras on the disc great. All of the Firefly backstory came to life. You can definitely see that Serenity is an act of passion and love. Joss Whedon has made something masterful.  <br /> <br />I use the XBox 360 HD player. If you have an XBox and you'd like to start watching blow away awesome movies, you can't beat the value.
B000F7CMRM|2.0|Simply put: the movie is boring.  Clich&eacute; upon clich&eacute; is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the \\"natural\\" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk \\"friend\\" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.<br /><br />All in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause. It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie.<br /><br />Save your money, save your time, choose another movie.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|This is going to be a different type of review, but, I believe, an honest one. The reason my review is a little dated is because my brother gave me this album on Thursday, November, 16, 2006. He said you've got to listen to this. It's great. Well, I was very hesitant in listening to it. You see, I had written Bob Dylan off back in the early '90's after I had seen him perform on a few shows on TV. I couldn't understand a thing he said, and the melodies sounded like junk. Bob's voice sounded like he had mush in his mouth, and he sounded like he was down in some dungeon. I was totally embarassed for him, and embarassed when old friends of mine approached me after seeing the same performances and riding me about why they could never see what I had seen in Dylan for years. <br /> <br />You see, I was a Bob Dylan fan from the beginning, way back in the Folk days of the sixties. I went through the Electric period when alot of Dylan fanatics turned on him, but I didn't. I went through his Spiritual years, also when many Dylan fans turned away from him and I stuck in there. But, after hearing how bad he was in his performing in the early to mid '90's, even I gave up. Now, my brother lays this \\"Modern Times\\" album on me. I put it in my CD player, expecting the mush I had last heard. Remember, I hadn't heard \\"Time Out Of Mind\\", or \\"Love and Theft\\" at all. When I had heard that he won awards for these two albums my reaction was one of disbelief, and didn't care to give them a try. When \\"Modern Times\\" started playing I couldn't believe my ears. This is the old Dylan, sort of. Sure, his voice was more gravelly, but I could understand him, and the band was excellent. A few songs like \\"Thunder On The Mountain\\", Spirit On The Water\\", When The Deal Goes Down\\", Nettie Moore\\", The Levee's Gonna Break\\", and \\"Ain't Talkin'\\", were pure Bob Dylan, with a blues twist to them. You know Folk always was just a step away from The Blues, all along. The songs like \\"Someday Baby\\" and \\"Beyond The Horizon\\"  are basically mainstream country-rock, easy listening, but with Bob Dylan's distinct style. Sinatra could have done \\"Someday Baby\\". <br /> <br />For me, Bob Dylan was back! Something I never thought would happen. What a great surprise! I have been wondering for a long while why two of my all-time \\"Real Country\\" heroes, Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson, had wanted to tour with Dylan. My gosh, do they want to turn their fans off? And, for what reason. <br /> <br />Well, as I'm sitting here, I can't wait, from what I've heard from other reviewers, to here \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" and \\"Love and Theft\\". Before hearing \\"Modern Times\\" I certainly wasn't going to be crazy enough to waste my money on the other two albums. Now, I am crazy enough to spend my money on the previous two. But, I don't think it's going to be a waste. I can't wait!
B00005JPCD|5.0|The incredible voice cast of Happy Feet should be proud of this animation masterpiece.  Mumble, an emperor penguin with a unique \\"heart song\\" sets out on a quest to find out what has happened to the food supply and in turn communicates through dance the importance of ecology.  Some of the ecological messages may miss most toddlers and kids, but the simple message that being different is not bad will still be understood as Mumble dances his \\"heart song\\".  The Characters of Ramon(wisecracking sidekick) and Lovelace(Barry Whitish Guru) both voiced by the magnificent Robin Williams steal the scenes and provide the perfect comedic element to the movie.  I love William's rendition of \\"My Way\\".
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I was sceptical. Cyclical climate change is and always has been universal. So what's new? The rate of change is new, unnatural and, if unchecked, catastrophic - the inescapable conclusion of Gore's thoroughly researched, honest and well documented argument. I was surprised by the force of the film without hysteria, rancour, spin or special effects. Consistent with the UK Stern Report, Gore shows the cost of reversing climate change to be negligible compared with the cost of neglecting it. The means to fix it are here and now. What are we waiting for? We're waiting for a critical mass of us who drive ourselves to our own fates, together with those who drive others, nations and corporations, to ease off the accelerator and apply the brake. Hazard ahead. Driver beware!
B00005JPCA|5.0|While many I knew thought that a blond guy couldn't possibly pull off Bond, I had seen Layer Cake and was pretty sure that Craig was capable of much.  What I didn't expect, was a screenplay so well written and updated that comparisons to recent Bond films would seem an insult.  Detailed breakdown as follows: <br /> <br />Acting:  While everybody does a great job, Daniel Craig and Eva Green are quite fantastic.  Green is appropriately playful and serious when the role requires it.  She gets many of the movie's best lines.  Your opinion of Craig's performance will come down to how well you understand what's being done to the character over the course of the movie.  Given that you do, Craig's performance is masterful.  I can't say more without spoiling something. <br /> <br />Score: Arnold's score feels VERY traditional.  I couldn't distinguish the main Bond theme in the end credits from its counterpart in early Bond movies.  This is good, though- it makes the movie feel connected to its early predecessors.  There are also some achingly beautful but short cues associated with scene changes where the camera pans over long highways, etc. <br /> <br />Effects: For a number of reasons, the effects are not the main attraction here.  However, when they are called for, they are pretty spectacular.  This isn't the gadget-driven Bond of recent years, but technology is rather seamlessly integrated into the film. <br /> <br />Plot: I've slowly learned that you don't go into Bond movies (and more generally, action movies) looking to be impressed by plot.  There's a certain plot structure that you know will be observed.  In this Bond, I didn't know most of the time where the plot was headed.  This aspect, alone, left me glued to the screen.  Casino Royale is, of course, based on the first Bond novel of the same name.  The powers that be decided to update the story and essentially restart the character a la Batman Begins.  What really struck me was how skillfully modern references were added in to make the story relevant and believable.  It doesn't seem too farfetched that the bare-bones of the plot could happen today.  In more ways than I can say here, this is not a traditional Bond film.  Approach it in that frame of mind and you'll be blown away.
B000005RT8|3.0|This release is probably best suited for the McCartney completist, but is still a very good listen.  The album came out after Paul dumped Wings and went solo.  Recorded in his home studio, he really did quite a bit of experimentation on this.  Though Paul is the master of variety, I just don't think this album holds together like many of his other releases.  Many of the songs are more new wave and heavy with synthesizers, which I quite like.  The best songs are Coming Up, Temporary Secretary and Waterfalls.  I was very pleased they put Goodnight Tonight on this remastered version.  I had this on album when it first came out, and the remastering makes it sound even better.
0671027344|1.0|This whole book is pure tripe. It's written extremely poorly and the plot is really severely lacking. The form is verging on ridiculous. My copy was published by MTV. If that doesn't scare you then you probably should stick to TV. If it does go pick up `notes from underground.'
0446310786|4.0|TKaM is not the finest piece of prose -- though it does have some terrific (sometimes humorous, sometimes heartbreaking) stretches.  Nor is it the most compelling story.  But it is a story well told, well voiced (by its very young narrator), and well paced.  Above all, it is a story whose themes -- addressed to the best and the worst in human nature -- endure, themes that (one alternately hopes and is greatly saddened to think) will endure forever.  For this reason, in spite of its quaint anachronistic feel, TKaM is a novel for the ages, and a particularly important read for children.  I had the special pleasure of listening to TKaM narrated by Sissy Spacek, the perfect voice for Scout.
B000HA4WT8|4.0|well, this movie was typical. over the passed few years the fast and the furious films have seemed to do a decent job giving an insider look to the current & up to date car enthusiast scene. however, sometimes it is very unrealistic. i'm assuming for the sake of action.  people seem to forget that it's just a movie. the action scenes are indeed far fetched, but they make the movie watchable. i don't know a TON about cars, so i can't really say if the movie was accuaretly displayed there or not. the plot was dry, like the other 2 of the series, but how exciting of a plot can you have with the amount of action and skilled driving packed into the movie. <br /> <br />acting wise i was slightly over impressed. i could have done with another main character, though he did put me in the mind of a young paul walker. i could have done without zachary ty bryan in the beginning. maybe that's just because the only other place i've seen him is home improvement.  <br /> <br />besides it being unrealstic, yet action packed. i have came to the conclusion that if you are into cars, it's worth a watch. i wouldn't recommend BUYING it, but renting it would be worth it. 4 stars.
0440224764|3.0|For a book that had been thoroughly entertaining, i cannot believe Mr. Grisham would end 'The Partner' on such a sour note. Maybe this is a bit extreme, but five minutes ago i was looking forward to picking up a new Grisham thriller to read. After finishing 'The Partner' i dont think i will ever read another Grisham book. If J.G. writes a 400 page book explaining WHY eva does what she does at the end of 'The Partner' then MAYBE i will stop fuming over this nauseating ending.
0670033375|3.0|The author, Diamond, has impeccable credentials.  Several of his scientific works, especially his 1975 collection which he edited, Ecology and evolution of Communities, are classics in the various fields in which he has worked.  His last work, Guns, Germs and Steel, earned him a Pulitzer, so you know he is well-regarded.<br /><br />In Collapse, Diamond surveys several carefully chosen civilizations where environmental impact of humans possibly led to their demise.  He starts with an overview of current-day Montana, and then covers Easter Island, Pitcairn Island, Henderson Island, Pueblo Indians of the Southwestern US, some of the Mayans, and Greenlanders.  He then covers a few success stories like New Guinea, Tikopia (pacific island), and Japan.<br /><br />Next he covers a few modern collapses like Rwanda, Haiti, China and Australia.  Lastly are a few chapters on practical lessons.<br /><br />The book starts slowly with descriptions of Montana ranches and communities and the changes in this area.  The pace and intensity of the writing pick up when Diamond speculates on Easter Island and its demise.  Diamond speculates on causes of the changes in Easter Island and its ecology.  Since he uses Easter Island as a \\"metaphor\\" for civilization and environmental degradation, this section of the book is vital.  Turns out that the story may well be different than Diamond knew.  See an article by Hunt in the New Scientist for the latest thoughts.  It seems that man's inhumanity to man may have been the main culprit in the sad story of the Easter Islanders.  Slavery and smallpox probably led to the demise of islander's more than their deforesting the island.  Nevertheless, the Easter Islanders did manage to deforest their land rather quickly.  There are still lessons to be drawn, but just not as clear-cut (play on words) as Diamond postulates.<br /><br />Another main part of Diamond's thesis concerns Greenland.  If you will read other sources, you will see that Diamond again over-speculates and leaves out important data.  The paucity of data on what happened to the last Greenlanders supports the idea that they simply packed up and left when the climate cooled too much for self-sufficiency.  Not nearly as spectacular an end as starving to death or being wiped out by the eskimos.<br /><br />The best parts of this book are, in my opinion, the parts where Diamond speculates on lost cultures.  You may not agree on all Diamond says, (nor do many professional scientists of various kinds) but at least Diamond gives us something to think about, and backs up his views with supporting studies.<br /><br />But in order to use these few examples as a metaphor for modern, global civilization, the examples should be more accurate and more comprehensive.  What about Asia, African and Europe?  In the end many, if not  most, of past civilizations died from war and politics.  If anything, Diamonds examples are warnings against big government and immorality.<br /><br />The weakest part of the book are the practical lessons.  Diamond, for example uses the Cuban missile crisis as a paradigm of how government can learn from past mistakes.  According to Diamond, Kennedy learned from the Bay of Pigs fiasco and then handled the missile crisis correctly.  Again, although institutions can learn from past mistakes, this particular example is exactly the opposite.  As I learned from Military War college printed and oral information, Kennedy completely misread the Russians and his poor handling of the Bay of Pigs is what led to the missle crisis.  He then surrendered completely, giving up our forward bases in Turkey and promising to let mass-murderer Castro alone.  And this is just one example of how poltical bias leads to biased conclusions.  Famine seems to almost always be cause by government policy, for example.  I recommend reading PJ O'Rourke's writings for a different take on Somalia, Bengladesh and the like.<br /><br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Its subject matter is interesting and well presented.  The conclusions are however suspect due to some bias on the part of the author.njoyed this book.

B00005JPCA|5.0|Despite significant changes to the Bond film formula, the world's most famous spy is surprisingly better than ever. Is this a James Bond movie, or a legitimate spy film? If you're not a fan of the old Bond films because the franchise had lost touch with reality, then let Casino Royale reintroduce you to the world's greatest spy.<br /><br />Some might not like the departure from some elements of the previous 20 Bond films, but I say that's what makes Casino Royale stand apart, and it's exactly why this film will soon be regarded as the best Bond film ever made. There are no scientifically impossible gadgets or physics (\\"Q\\" doesn't even make an appearance) and no ridiculous doomsday plots (he's not saving the world, just proving himself). There are no brainless beauties just for the sake of being eyecandy (though Eva Green is absolutely beautiful as Vesper Lynd).<br /><br />But what of Daniel Craig? If you base your critique of an actor's performance as Bond on how well he compares to the character in the pages of Ian Fleming's novels, then this James Bond is the best in his bigscreen history. Sean Connery was an entertaining Bond, but he was never this good at being Bond. Maybe it's because the James Bond franchise is no longer a \\"relic of the Cold War\\" (as M refered to Bond in Goldeneye), but a modern film franchise that intends to be taken seriously in the 21st century. And after watching Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, I'm taking James Bond seriously for the first time in my life.<br /><br />This Bond actually appears worthy of 00 status. He is equal parts bold and brash. He's extraordinarily talented and resolute. Most importantly, he's human. He has personality. In Casino Royale, James Bond isn't the same man from the beginning to the end. We watch him change. For the first time ever when watching a Bond film, I felt involved with the plot.<br /><br />This time, the film means something. It's not just mindless entertainment, but excellent cinema. Pick this one up!s one up!

It is a year earlier and you can tell. Geoff's voice is just better. He sings a much better representation of Mindcrime. Yes Livecrime may be a bit more polished but it is supposed to be. It is from two nights put together. It isn't actually a straight through concert. This one is. One night. A couple missed notes here and there but that's real. Geoff doesn't lower near as many parts vocally. I Don't Believe in Love and Eyes of a Stranger are sung perfectly. You can tell the tour took a little from him if you listen to both this and Livecrime. The sound I thought is also pretty good. I didn't have a problem with it. It didn't sound like a bootleg or anything. I love it.
B000002MZ6|5.0|This album is simply fascinating!<br />It starts with 'In the beginnig' and continues with 'Let There Be Light', 2 very inspired songs which introduce you to the entire atmosphere of the album.<br />Oceania is an 'Island' style of song, although better sounding.<br />A New Beginning is a great song with a foreign speaking choir which definitely conveys the message of a 'New Beginning'!<br />There is not a single song on this album that one feels it should not be there.<br />Overall, extremely inspired and sending the audience a sense of 'well being' and 'out of this world'!

If you want your children to learn that their elders are out of touch and full of nonsense, take them to see this movie.

The fluffy and cute main character didn't even stick out to them.  What a waste of money and time.

B000F6IOC0|4.0|Take one part Horror movie, one part action movie and mix in just a bit of political intrigue as well as a bit of classical Shakespearian family values (which usually involved stabbing a family member in the back) and you have Underworld: Evolution.   <br /> <br />Kate Beckinsale once again paints on the fighting black leather and assumes the attitude and killer instinct that go with the character of Selene, a Vampire death dealer.  She continues in the movie to search for more answers to questions that were brought about in the first Underworld.   Quite frankly, I thought this was a better movie than the first.  The story was more clear and easier to follow, but surprisingly complex and full of characters who weren't falling into a sterotype.  As Selene and the Werewolf/Vampire Hybrid, Michael (Scott Speedman) rush to make sure that Marcus (one of the oldest and most powerful of warriors, and a hybrid himself) doesn't free his brother William (the first of the Lycans).  If he does, destruction will reign...we can assume.  These two brothers are tough as we find out in the opening and the truck battle scene of the movie.   <br /> <br />Michael is not to be toyed with.  After Kraven releases him, he searches for the key to unlock his brothers prison.  A lot of things from the first movie start to play a part in this movie as we find out more about Selene's mortal family and the role they play in this.  We find out more about the oldest immortal, William and Marcus' father, who refuses to kill his own sons.  The story becomes more dangerous and more insidious as it moves to the climax.  Blood and gore abound in this movie, giving it the well deserved R rating, but it's actually confined to the fight scenes and does not seem out of place for the type of fighting that's going on. <br /> <br />Overall, the movie was better than expected.  It had a brisk pace, a good story and dialogue as well as great action sequences and impressive special affects.

B000BCE918|4.0|What an entertaining family of films (not to be confused with \\"family films\\"). And with the release of Jurassic Park IV on the horizon (2008 directed by III's Johnston), picking up this trilogy for your collection is a no-brainer in order to get back into dino-fever.<br /><br />Jurassic Park is the film that brought dinosaur movies out of the stone age. The beasts aren't stop motion....They're real! For the filming of these flicks they actually cloned dinosaurs from dino DNA preserved in prehistoric amber! Alright, alright...they look real. Very real. The FX are brilliant in all three Jurassic Parks. And that's the real beauty of the trilogy...the dino FX.<br /><br />Jurassic Park stayed pretty true to Crichton's novel, which was perhaps the fastest I've ever read an entire book (apx 5 hours). I tore through it because it was so good. But there were definitely some impressionable scenes like the T-rex swimming in the river (\\"like an alligator!\\") and of course \\"the bird cage\\" (or was the bird cage not until The Lost World novel?) that were omitted. At least \\"the bird cage\\" made its appearance on film in III.<br /><br />The Lost World was the exact opposite of \\"true to the book\\". Spielberg lost it in The Lost World. He took a lot of liberties making it his own story. How do you leave out of the movie one of the biggest stars of the book: the color-changing, chameleon-like, man-eater, Carnotaurus? Thank goodness Crichton was still involved in the screenplay or who knows how much more the story would have been twisted for the big screen.<br /><br />Jurassic III introduced the mighty Spinosaurus and brought in the pterodactyls. William H. Macy and Tea Leone might not of been the best celeb choices (can you say campy and campier...how about goofy and goofier?), but they got the job done. And Crichton kept everyone in line with his involvement again.<br /><br />Chrichton is also getting (at least) writing credits for IV, so the next installment should be good.<br /><br />Jurassic Park, The Lost World and Jurassic Park III all could have been a bit more realistic/brutal and still got the PG-13; the book versions of Jurassic Park and The Lost World were definitely R-rated. But all 3 films chose the audience friendly/happy ending roads to big ticket sales.<br /><br />Hey, these could indeed be \\"cool\\" family films if you have young kids that are into dinosaurs, you have the time to watch with them (you know...to Parentally Guide) and you're liberal enough to believe that a little dino-violence won't warp your kids' little minds. One thing's for sure...there are no appearances in any of the films by the big purple guy, so if your kids are expecting Barney they will be in for a rude awakening.<br /><br />At the time of this writing this 3-pack was priced like a buy 2, get one free, so it's like paying for your two faves of the bunch and getting the other one free. Add it to your cart.II all could have been a bit more realistic/brutal and still got the PG-13; the book versions of Jurassic Park and The Lost World were definitely R-rated.

B00005AQF7|5.0|Standout Tracks: G FUNK INTRO, GIN AND JUICE, THA SHIZNIT(takes shots at Luke), LODI DODI(the best remake of a hip hop classic ever!), MURDER WAS THE CASE, SERIAL KILLA, WHO AM I, FOR ALL MY N***AZ AND B****ES, AINT NO FUN, DOGGY DOGG WORLD etc. Filler:NONE!. Bottom Line: This was the best album that Snoop ever made period. Not only did he outsell The Chronic he also solidified the west coast's position on the hip hop map. The production was excellent, the lyrics and the hooks were unforgettable plus he made you respect the G-funk era. It is unfortunate that every other album after this is below average but hey thats life. The only album that Snoop has that can stand next to Doggystyle but not touch it is Dead Man Walking. Gin and Juice, Lodi Dodi, Murder Was The Case, Serial Killa and Who Am I are all classics that make this album a definite requirement for your collection.
0446528056|3.0|I've read all of Sparks' books, and I'm a huge fan. I gave this one 3 stars because, for me, it falls somewhere in the middle between my favorite A WALK TO REMEMBER and my least favorite TRUE BELIEVER.  <br /> <br />Everyone says DEAR JOHN so depressing, but if I'm honest that's part of what I loved. I cried the whole last half of the book. It's a beautiful story, and although there are things I'd like to change to make for a perfectly happy ending, really Sparks' readers know that usually isn't the case. I think he left room for a sequal, which I would read, although, I must say I'm not waiting on pins and needles for it.

B00005JPCA|4.0|James Bond has always been a shallow figure, so super suave and so heavily stylized, yet completely lacking in substance. At last, we have a film that gives Agent 007 some depth and complexity; it's called \\"Casino Royale,\\" and while it isn't a perfect film, it's still a far cry from some of the overly ambitious early attempts in the franchise. It's an action film, yet the story isn't drowned out in wall-to-wall stunts. It's a mystery, yet the twists and turns aren't piled on top of each other. It's even a love story, yet it isn't sappy or melodramatic. This is the James Bond movie I've been waiting for: a pleasing blend of classic intrigue, danger, suspense, and sexuality in a plot that--true to the Spy Film genre--isn't even remotely plausible. What a fun, fun movie this was.    This is the first Bond film in many years that's actually based on an Ian Fleming novel. I can't say whether or not that made it worth seeing; I've never read anything he's written, and I can't compare them to the other twenty Bond films. But I can say that this story hit all the right notes, both as an action film and as a character analysis. I could describe in detail what the film is about, but does it really matter? All you need to know is that it's a prequel, and it covers Bond's very first mission. The long and short of it is that he has to prevent a banker from winning at a casino tournament in Montenagro; the prize money will only go towards funding terrorist activities. Specifically what activities are never alluded to, but that's irrelevant. We all know that terrorism, in any form, should be stopped.    Early on in the film, Bond says, \\"I understand double-ohs have a very short life expectancy.\\" How true: the character is now played by Daniel Craig, the sixth actor to assume the role (following a long and fairly mediocre run with Pierce Brosnan). This new portrayal gives Bond a different dimension, one that helps to define him more as a person and less as a debonair drone. Craig definitely gives him a suave demeanor, and to say he isn't physically attractive would be a bold-faced lie. Yet there's an underlying ruggedness to this new James Bond, one that replaces some of the more pristine Bonds of the past. His face shows some wear, as if to say that he's seen plenty of action. He's even capable of making mistakes, as seen during the casino tournament when he incorrectly assumes the tactics of his opponent.    Noticeably absent from \\"Casino Royale\\" are the wealth of over the top gadgets and gizmos; the best we're given are a couple of guns and a few miscellaneous items in the glove compartment of a sports car (including a defibrillator, which will eventually come in handy). I liked this; for once, Bond will have to use his wits and physical strength as opposed to ridiculous science fiction-grade props to gain the upper hand. There are no watches with built in lasers or pens that fire tiny darts. There's no eject button for his car's driver's side seat. There's no hidden radio in his cufflinks. Of course, such a change also required the absence of Q (first played by Desmond Llewelyn, then played by John Cleese). He could always be counted on for a bit of comedy relief.    But I see this as a good thing; this time around, comedy relief wasn't needed. Small doses of appropriately timed humor were scattered all throughout the film, and not just from one character. It was an especially welcome change for Judi Dench to be given a couple funny lines; M was always such a serious character, and she definitely needed to lighten up. In \\"Casino Royale,\\" she's initially portrayed as being very hesitant around Bond, especially since his ego caused him to mess up a few very important missions. He even breaks into her apartment, not to steal anything, but simply to speak to her face to face. She finds such an act untrustworthy, and she's understandably worried about his success at the casino tournament.    Interestingly enough, those moments in the casino are the best the film has to offer, despite being relatively quiet and low key. Bond plays against Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), the film's lead villain. Despite the fact that he says and does little, he's probably one of the coldest villains ever seen in a Bond film. He sits across from 007 with an expression that you'd swear would turn you to stone (if it weren't for the fact that his left eye has an injured tear duct, resulting in tears of blood). He fiddles with his poker chips intensely yet carefully. He makes grandiose bets that he knows Bond will attempt to outdo. There's calculation going through this man's mind, and it was fascinating to watch him at that table (it was also fascinating to watch him during an especially uncomfortable torture scene). If it weren't for the fact that he doesn't fit the usual profile of a Bond villain, that he doesn't have a secret lair rigged with electronic booby traps, and that he doesn't have an exotic pet, then I'd say he would appeal to those looking for a classic bad guy.    And then there's Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), an accoutant and the inevitable love interest. She and Bond play off each other perfectly, with one initially finding the other's personality flaws irritating. Yet there's a definite attraction, made stronger by the mission they're to complete together. She eventually awakens within Bond a desire, one that allows him to see her as a person as opposed to a sexual object (and we all know that James Bond is notoriously sexual). After a while, she, too, beings to see him in a different light. At that point, we can't help but wonder what would happen if the world's greatest secret agent were to settle down, marry, and possibly have a family. Can anyone picture such a circumstance? Of course they can't; James Bond is a man of action, dedicated to service but attached to no one.    This is the kind of complexity I've always wanted to see, and I'm glad the filmmakers of \\"Casino Royale\\" decided to make use of it. I'm alsoglad that it was balanced with a couple of good action sequences; yes, each one is over the top and completely unrealistic, but they're so entertaining that the little details aren't even noticed. Of course no one can jump off of a hundred-foot crane and live to tell the tale. Of course you can't shoot at someone while leaping in mid air. Of course such bodily harm would result in debilitating injuries. No one thought about such things while watching the other James Bond movies, so why start now? This is a worthy addition to the 007 franchise; I can only hope that future additions will be as good.

0307346609|5.0|With his new book Max Brooks creates a realistic near future with our world ravaged by the walking dead. WORLD WAR Z, from start to finish, is presented as an UN commissioned oral history, consisting of a series of interviews with various survivors of the zombie plague virus which originated somewhere in China, swept the world and nearly killed off humankind. We not only hear from the politicians, scientists and soldiers of what became a bizarre world war; we also get some insight as to how the average (and a few not so average) held out and helped to beat back the overwhelming numbers of ghouls who were soon literally clawing at every wall and door. It's not only the physically strong, quick witted and well-armed who survived but also some of those that we would naturally consider to be easy pickings for the zombie: the complacent and sheltered suburban housewife, the timid and sensitive little man, the nerdy tech geek, the hadicapped, and even those young children and cute and cuddly housepets who were lost or abandoned in the the confusion and terror during the early days of the plague's spread. Brooks does good work showing what they were forced to do and what they became as they adapted to this new world. For example, the interview with the Japanese blind man and his sidekick, the formerly socially detached internet addict, was excellently done and made one of the best stories in the book. Another great tale was the one told by a mercenary who was hired to guard a celebrity hideaway/compound. The fate of that place was told with a humorous cynicism and a culmination of poetic justice that can only be read as a sad satire on today's cultural wasteland (you will also easily guess who are the real-life people characterized in this particular story).<br /><br />The zombie isn't our only enemy in this infected world. From the interviews we read about ecological disasters, the return of old diseases and the beginnings of new psychological disorders. We hear of people who saw the plague as an outlet for their particular hatreds and perversities, and of others who saw in it an opportunity to declaring themselves kings of their own little dungheaps. Zombies may have rendered many oldstyle religious and political fanaticisms obsolete, only to help create new ones. The world after the plague is a place where some of the old world powers disintegrated in impotence amidst chaos, while others have arisen in the most unlikely places. It is a time of new and strange alliances, with overwhelming numbers of refugees, many of them the migrations of entire national populations, it is a place of sinister phenomena with disturbing mysteries (e.g. the fate of the North Koreans). Meanwhile, the war continues. As many of the survivors fled to the cold northern parts of the globe, so did the ghouls. Despite the constant vigilance of the allied UN forces, with each spring thaw the zombie continues to rise and to kill.<br /><br />Now I would also like to say a few things about the comments made by some reviewers here on the political opinions of Max Brooks:<br />I do not understand their anger, nor do I respect their spite. Brooks created a fictional world as he sees it and he pulls it off. He is never in the reader's face with his politics and he never resorts to preaching those politics. Instead he subtly allows his views to shape and mold his book as all other authors do. Whatever he might think of the present American political situation, the Iraq War, the NRA, organized religion etc., he has written a genuinely intelligent and entertaining work of satire/commentary and horror/science fiction. One doesn't need to agree with all of his viewpoints in order to recognize that this is a good book and simply enjoy it. I for one wish that this book was longer and hope that he writes another volume of its kind.the plague as an outlet for their particular hatreds and perversities, and of others who saw in it an opportunity to declaring themselves kings of their own little dungheaps.

B000AWYOGE|4.0|I avoided this remake because I preferred the Japanese Ju On to the American Grudge but catching part of the Japanese Dark Water interested me enough to watch the American Dark Water.  The American Dark Water is much much better than the American Grudge.  The American Dark Water can stand on its own as a watchable movie and another strong understated performance from Jennifer Connelly.  I like the small movies with the excellent casts like Dark City and Slipping Down Life so this movie is to my taste although I did fast forward the middle after suffering the very realistic desperate apartment hunter on a budget in Manhattan at the mercy of the merciless real estate purveyor.  And is that the real Roosevelt Island?   The depiction of Roosevelt Island makes a lot more sense than the glowing advertisments.  Didn't Roosevelt Island originally house the criminally insane? Not exactly the hop and skip from Bloomingdale's that one would have in mind.    The ending made me tear up but surprisingly the Japanese Dark Water ending did not. I think that the American Dark Water is a better movie because of Jennifer Connelly's performance.

I've listened to it many of times now to try and get what lots of other people are getting from him, but to no avail.  I'm sorry, but it's just a lame cd to me.  I'm going to stick with the more dynamic songwriting Nick; Nick Cave.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Many of the other reviews have summarized Akira Kurosawa's excellent film, so I won't recap it since you are probably familiar with The Seven Samurai.<br /><br />Rather, if you are concerned about shelling out the money for this edition when you already have the earlier release, rest easy.  It is well worth the price.  Having seen the movie many, many times, I was shocked at how the upgraded footage made scenes seem new and brought out many details I had missed.  The supplemental materials: commentaries, documentaries, interviews, and the booklet (with reminiscences from Mifune Toshiro) complement the movie nicely.<br /><br />If you are on the fence, go ahead and buy it.  This DVD is worth it!
B000000OTY|5.0|This would be in my top 5 cd's to take on a lone island for the rest of my life.  One of the best shows ever caught on cd.  Gabriel is one of our best modern day composers.  The dynamics of the songlist on this live performance are amazing.  It's one great journey through pop music blending seamlessly with great composing, song writing & atmosphere.  The DVD of it is also amazing.

0679720200|4.0|This short novel exemplifies existentialism. Life is meaningless and daily events are trivial. These points are emphasized through the main character, Meursault, and his dispassionate manner. His reaction towards the death of his mother is summed up with the indifferent statement of \\"Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe...\\" As incomprehensible as his response is, as a reader, I found myself sympathizing and relating to this emotionally isolated man.<br /><br /> The Stanger, though not a happy book, is a an insightful and interesting read. Recognizing unfortunate similarities between yourself and the character of Meursault is bound to take place (such as the need to observe surrounding human tendencies, or the need to guard yourself against disappointment). Though you will not be able to fully embrace the character Meursault, you cannot help but feel that his outlook on life makes perfect sense.<br /><br />  Albert Camus excels at using the various characters within The Stanger to represent allegories of life. With old Salamano and his dog, one witnesses the power of daily routine and the resistance to change. Camus' writing style is to the point and easy to read. I enjoyed the existential theme and loved attempting to dissect the complex character of Meursault.
0679721037|4.0|So I would give this five stars, but I just can't. This book captivated me, I couldn't put it down and all that, but it's about the death of countless thousands of people. You can't love or like a book about this subject matter. It reads well and is put together well. Following the plight of six A-Bomb victims is a horrifying experience. This updated version has an additional, \\"Aftermath\\" chapter in which the lives of these six individuals is updated to around 1980. I find myself looking at humanity differently now. What the crap!? How something like this happened and how little it is talked about is unbelievable. Having read basically nothing else about this subject I would have to say that this book is a good point to start at that will not allow you to ignore this piece of human happening any farther. What happened and how what happened was treated is a true sign of how sad and despicable human beings can be. This should be required reading for everyone.

B00005JPCA|5.0|There have been several reboots of the James Bond series but this one is by far the most dramatic and succesful. In `License to Kill' the producers decided to send Bond back to his roots with the grittiest, most realistic Bond movie ever. Unfortunately they produced arguably the worst official Bond movie ever. Besides `From Russia with Love', `Casino Royale' is perhaps the most faithful adaptation of a Bond novel. The first third of the movie sets up the story and the rest of the movie picks up where the book begins. There was a complete reworking of the ending to add excitement but it actually served to make things rather confusing.<br /><br />So is it a success? I am a lifelong Bond fan who owns nearly every Bond film on DVD and I would measure this film as one of the best ever. Like Batman Begins, this as a textbook example of how a venerable series can be reworked a correctly. Unlike many Bond fans I was pleased with the choice of Daniel Craig as the new Bond and he exceeded my best expectations. Gone are the asinine Bond one liners. Gone are the crazy gadgets and say farewell to Q and Moneypenny. The core of guns, gorgeous woman and opulent settings remain intact, in fact this may be the most beautiful Bond movie ever created. The only complaint I have is that the music wasn't up to par. For some reason the producers of this generation of Bond films don't seem to be able to capture the fantastic music accompaniments of films like Goldfinger, You Only Die Twice and even Moonraker.<br /><br />Die Another Day made piles of cash but the series was becoming increasingly painful. The absurd stunts, the headache inducing double entendres, the bad dialogue and the silly characters would have eventually done the series in. After Moonraker the producers pulled way back and released For Your Eyes Only. Personally I found Moonraker the more enjoyable of the two. Casino Royale is the best reboot yet and ranks as the best Bond since at least the Roger Moore era. The story is smaller, the characters more believable and the dialogue is VASTLY improved. Sorry Pierce but Daniel Craig is a big improvement. Good Job EON.smaller, the characters more believable and the dialogue is VASTLY improved. Sorry Pierce but Daniel Craig is a big improvement.

B000K7VHPU|5.0|`The Illusionist' provides great, old-fashioned fun.  Much like `The Prestige,' it is a magician's movie that requires the audience to keep their eyes on the subject.  This time the titled `illusionist,' Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is at the top of his form, but instead of wanting fame and fortune like the magicians in `The Prestige,' he keeps his eyes on the duchess, the love interest of the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell).  At one point his fame gets him invited to an affair held by the Crown Prince, himself, and Eisenheim provides a trick to pull up the Prince's sword, much like the child with the pure heart does in the medieval fable.  He succeeds, but not without some doubts.  His embarrassment at this awkward moment creates a rivalry with `the illusionist'.  Supported by the chief inspector (Paul Giamatti), Eisenheim has just enough time to conjure a brazen love affair with the duchess.  But a drunken confrontation between the Prince and his unfaithful fianc&eacute; provides tragedy, one that seems to only be answered by a different venue on the illusionist's stage.  The Prince's jealous rage has him figuratively putting a noose around Eisenheim, one from which he must escape.<br /><br />While `The Prestige' benefits from Christopher Nolan's modern direction with a progressively dark appeal, `The Illusionist' has time-honored filmmaking with appeal that delivers its magic with greater resolution (from director, Neil Burger).  Both movies are excellent and are edited with precision, but while `The Prestige' is masterful at development; `The Illusionist' wins in a matchup.
B00005JPCA|4.0|When Ian Fleming wrote him, James Bond was a tough-as-nails, take-no-prisoners spy.  Sean Connery played him that way in the beginning and never truely got away from it, but over the years, Bond got softened up and too chatty.  Pierce Brosnan offered up the excellent GOLDENEYE and followed that with three pretty good Bonds.<br /><br />But Daniel Craig is going to remake the franchise and bring it back more to Ian Fleming's original creation.  Craig's Bond is cold, calculating, and driven.  A hard, bloody job takes a harder, bloodthirsty man who brings everything to the bottom line no matter what the cost.  Craig even looks as rough-and-tumble as Connery did in the early movies.  He has a predator's body, heavily muscled and lean.  His eyes are those of a hunter.<br /><br />Daniel Craig has done a lot of different things, including being in a Tomb Raider movie and other action films, so he has quite a bit to bring to the picnic.  Also, at 38, he should be able to carry the role for a few movies.  Martin Campbell, the director, gave us Zorro with Antonio Banderas and Brosnan's first Bond film, GOLDENEYE.  Bond writers, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH and DIE ANOTHER DAY) return for this movie as well as the next, but Paul Haggis (CRASH, MILLION DOLLAR BABY, FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS) joins them.<br /><br />The plot in CASINO ROYALE shifts and evolves, begging a little patience from the audience but ultimately rewarding it.  The movie actually \\"feels\\" as though it's come to an ending three times, with mixed results, before finally cutting to credits.<br /><br />While in Madagascar, Bond -- newly risen to double-oh status in a dark, cold prologue -- is hunting a terrorist funding network.  Almost immediately, the film plunges into headlong action that takes advantage of PARKOUR, the free running style that's gotten so much attention in France.  These sequences are awesome, and even when you see them you'll have trouble believing them.  Of course, they're helped along by some CG work and stunt gear, but nevertheless, it's a romp that ends in a fiery shootout at an embassy.<br /><br />We get introduced to Le Chiffre, the terrorist banker that is Bond's true quarry, in a threatening scene that shows what he is up against and the threats he faces on a daily basis.  He has an oddity, as most Bond villains do, though his isn't of a homicidal nature.  He has mismatched eyes and one of them weeps blood.<br /><br />Bond picks up Le Chiffre's trail in the Bahamas, providing a nice scenic backdrop to action and beautiful women in swimwear.  His infiltration of the Ocean Club to get the information he needs is simple and direct, but with all the finesse of a sledgehammer at work.  This is Fleming's raw Bond at work that so many of the moviegoers haven't ever witnessed because they haven't read the books.<br /><br />THe action and plotting quickly adds layers of complexity, providing a great bit of storytelling that somehow even manages to make the protracted card game interesting even though it should have passed much more quickly.  Then the endings begin.<br /><br />CASINO ROYALE is the start of the new Bond franchise.  The coming movies are going to be interesting, and this movie undoubtedly sets the tone.  So, divided though the camp may be, Daniel Craig looks like the 007 for this generation.they're helped along by some CG work and stunt gear, but nevertheless, it's a romp that ends in a fiery shootout at an embassy. <br /> <br />We get introduced to Le Chiffre, the terrorist banker that is Bond's true quarry, in a threatening scene that shows what he is up against and the threats he faces on a daily basis.

B000J103X4|5.0|I just heard the CD a few days ago, and it is serious as a heart attack. There is no doubt this CD is what hip hop is suppose to be. If it is not a classic, then it is real close to being one. Well have to wait and see. I hadn't heard The Documentary before i heard this one, but after i did, i didn't even want to mess with it after i did hear it cause Doctor's Advocate is so nice. His flow, wordplay, and delivery has gotten better since Documentary. The CD is so nice, that the song \\"One Blood\\" is only a decent song and not one of the best. For most of these so called rappers out here, that song would be there best. He is not only the aire to the Aftermath dynasty, but will carry them and the rest of the West Coast into the next decade if he keeps this up. The only negatives on the CD for me is him mentioning the West Coast so much like we don't already know where he's from, and throwing Dr. Dre's name many times thru out the CD. Overall, this CD is a must buy cause it is the real deal and he is the truth.
0316172324|3.0|This is a book about the split decisions we make--our first impression, our gut reaction, our instinct--within the first two seconds of encountering a problem. Gladwell sets up in his introduction that we too often disregard that gut feeling and eventually over-think, over-analyze, and over-rationalize our decisions. Like in THE TIPPING POINT, Gladwell makes his point through varied and interesting case studies in unexpected fields of study. And although I found some of the case studies fascinating, I was under-whelmed by Gladwell's point overall. Maybe I expected the evidence for making snap judgments to be more compelling. From the title of the book, I expected Gladwell's point to be more about the advantages of snap decisions, but he also provides plenty of examples of when snap judgments can be disastrous. While this is all interesting, I was left feeling like Gladwell's point was a bit muddied. As opposed to a book FOR the advantages of that snap decisions, it seems like a book just about snap decisions, with the theme being that sometimes they are good and sometimes they are bad. Which, for all the interest of the case studies, is a fairly pedestrian thesis.
B00005JPCA|5.0|I've watched Bond films since I was a wee child, and have always enjoyed the mix of action, romance and exotic locales.  But the movies of late have become so formulaic and staid that the franchise was in danger of a giant leap over the shark. <br /> <br />So, the producers of this latest film did exactly what those who made \\"Batman Begins\\" last year did.  They went back to the beginning, stripped away all the fancy gadgets, pithy one liners and unbelievable plots and got back to the simple idea of a British agent who is a cool, calculating killing machine. <br /> <br />There could have been no better choice for this sort of Bond that Daniel Craig.  The man comes aross as coldly single-minded when on a mission.  His affect is calm, well composed and steely throughout the movie.  Watching this guy you can really believe he could wipe someone out without batting an eye. <br /> <br />Playing against him is the lovely Eva Green, as different from the stereotypical Bond girl as any woman could be.  The two start off as reluctant team members, with Green's character loathfully dismissive of Bond as a murderous womanizer.  Needless to say, her attitude does a 180 degree turn as the movie unfolds. <br /> <br />There are many of the classic Bond accessories, including high tech gadgets and fancy roadsters.  But these serve as spice to liven up an already excellent story, not as the main dish in themselves.  Throw in international intrigue and some fantastic action sequences, and you have a refreshingly original film that stays true to the best of the series.  Very highly recommended.

B000HWZ4A2|5.0|King Vidor's hysterically overwrought 1949 film is finally available on DVD, and well worth a look. It's full of ludicrously didactic speeches (by Ayn Rand herself) and mismatched performances (Neal's \\"expressionist\\" performance - all angles and curves - v. Cooper's exhausted naturalism). It is not a forgotten masterpiece, as some have recently claimed, but it is endlessly fascinating. Rand attempts to appropriate Nietzsche (Roark = Nietzschean superman) and place him in an American context. Yet for all its celebration of individual initiative/integrity, and all its attacks on the masses and mob mentality, the film seems to want us to SUBMIT to the charisma and force of the male protagonist. How is this not unlike what the National Socialists attempted by claiming Nietzsche as a precursor to fascist ideology? Note, in particular, the final shot and its jaw-dropping symbolism: Roark astride the world's tallest skyscraper as the camera (simulating the POV of Dominique) slowly makes its ways towards his outstretched legs? You might think my write-up a bit exaggerated -- but wait until you see the film! My review is modest in comparison!!
0812550757|4.0|What can one say about this book that hasn't been said before?  \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" is fundamentally different from \\"Ender's Game.\\"  Those expecting epic space battles and wild technology will instead be confronted with science fiction in which the primary science is anthropology, which is a welcome change of pace.  \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" is by turns gripping, moving, frustrating, interesting, preachy and grossly manipulative.  It's not perfect, but what is?<br /><br />Wise readers will stop the Ender series at the end of \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" and pretend that \\"Xenocide\\" doesn't exist.  Don't say I didn't warn you.
1932100660|4.0|This is a very powerful book supported by solid scientific evidence, that states high protein diets may be detrimental to your health. Dr. Campbell's recommendation is that the reader should become vegan. I am not disputing the fact that there are numerous reasons to not eat meat; Hoof and mouth, mad cow, trichnosis, animal rights and welfare, it just doesn't taste good, etc. I just question whether veganism is really needed <br /> <br />The issues I have with his conculsions are as follows; <br /> <br />1) Dr. Campbell suggests through out the book that the problem with western diets is that there's too much protein without enough fruits, vegetables, and complex carbs. So, why wouldn't I just increase my servings of fruits, veggies, complex carbs, and cut down on the meat, why do I have to cut it out altogether? <br /> <br />2) The healthiest populations in the world still include animal products but in very small amounts i.e. the Okinawans (Largest centegenarian population), the Andorrans (The longest estimated life span in the world), and the Mediterranean populations in general. <br /> <br />3) The general information coming from the study has been the exact same information coming from the health experts for decades: increase the fruits, vegetables, and Complex carbs, cut down on the animal products and refined sugar. <br /> <br />4)Now this has nothing to do with Campbell's scientific findings, but the last part of the book degenerates into a \\"me versus Big Medicine\\" and \\"Big Medicine\\" has been trying to shut me up for decades. He sounds a little like Kevin Trudeau. <br /> <br />All in all, this book provides the everyday person hard scientific proof that we need to radically change our diets for our own sakes. If people walked away from this book with any information, it would be that our health is in our own hands. That we can do more to protect ourselves by watching what we eat, then by going to the doctor. But we also don't have to take 30 nutritional supplements a day to do it. A good, balanced diet is the true miracle pill.

B00005JPCA|5.0|I am a die-hard James Bond fan. I was absolutely devastated when I learned that Pierce Brosnan wouldn't be returning for a fifth installment as Bond and that blondie Daniel Craig was chosen as the replacement. I spent almost two years dreading \\"Casino Royale,\\" convinced that it would be absolutely horrible and that Craig's performance would be a disgrace to the character. Well, all that worrying was a waste of time on my part. When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong, and I was very wrong about this.<br /><br />Here's the bottom line: \\"Casino Royale\\" is the best Bond movie ever...hands-down.<br /><br />This film takes the series back to the very beginning, when Bond is first granted his double-0 status. Based on Ian Fleming's novel, \\"Casino Royale\\" opens with a gritty black and white sequence that depicts Bond's first government-sanctioned kills. The film soon seeps into full-color mode and features a fantastic 20-minute footchase between Bond and a sprinty African bombmaker. Bond soon finds himself hot on the tails of Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a terrorist banker who weeps tears of blood and has a nasty gambling habit that's lost his clients a lot of money. Le Chiffre decides to participate in a high-stakes French poker game in hopes of recouping his losses. MI6 sends Bond there to play against Le Chiffre and prevent him from winning. M (Judi Dench) sends a government accountant, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), to keep an eye on Bond, but 007 can't manage to take his eyes off HER. Eventually Bond and Vesper find themselves in grave danger at the hands of Le Chiffre. There is torture, bloodshed, and suspense, but I don't want to give away any more of the plot because it's so exciting and I don't want to spoil it for anyone!<br /><br />Overall, \\"Casino Royale\\" is brilliant. Craig captures the true essence of James Bond that is depicted in Fleming's novels: an unstoppable killing machine. Craig's performance is also incredibly physical. (He did most of his own stunts for the film.) I really enjoyed the way that the film took a few steps back and attempted explain WHY Bond is the way he is (sort of the way in which \\"Batman Begins\\" reshaped the Batman franchise). This isn't the same suave and unfeeling Bond we all know and love. Craig's James Bond is much more human. He's very introspective and allows himself to fall in love with Vesper very easily. Ultimately, their romance doesn't have a happy ending, which explains why James is the way he is with women. So many pieces of the puzzle from more than 40 years of Bond movies fall into place because of this film.<br /><br />Daniel Craig, if you're reading this review, I'm so sorry that I ever doubted you! Now that I've seen the film, there is no doubt in my mind that you are TRULY James Bond! I still don't understand why the director didn't give you a box of Nice 'n Easy to darken up your hair a bit, but I got over the blonde thing after about ten minutes.<br /><br />James Bond is back, and he's better than ever! \\"Casino Royale\\" surpassed all my expectations.

B00005JPCD|5.0|I took my three children ranging from 7 to 3 to see Happy Feet at the theater today. They all categorically loved it, although to be truthful, my 3 year old did get a little antsy towards the last stretch of the film. This has nothing to do with the film and everything to do with the natural attention span of a just turned 3 year old. The visuals are magnificent, the music was wonderful and the story is classic with a wonderful message. There are a few scenes that can be frightening to young children involving two intense chase scenes but I actually thought the scary scenes in Finding Nemo was scarier than Happy Feet's. My children quickly got over their first startled fright and enjoyed the intense chase scenes that felt almost like roller coaster rides, the animation was so great. There is definitely a little more overt sexuality then I liked, which luckily went right over my kids heads. But I wasn't offended by it since they were penguins and not humans. <br /> <br />I almost didn't see this film because of all the negative reviews it garnered from Yahoo users. So many people hated this film for anti-Christian, anti-human, bleeding heart liberal environmental propaganda and pro-immigration issues. (OK - I thought the person that raised the pro-immigration issue was definitely a wacko...) These are probably the same people that burn picture books like \\"And Tango makes Three\\" which was the TRUE story of two male penguins that adopted an egg and raised a hatchling at the Central Park zoo. They are offended more for what they believe the story is telling rather than what it is saying. Reading into it a negativity that is not there. So it is with Happy Feet. I say this because I am a Christian and I am not a bleeding heart liberal, and I do not condone extreme animal rights groups like PETA, but I loved this film. All those who believe that the penguin elders are made to be Christian fundamentalists don't see that they could also be pagan high priests, orthodox jews,islamic fundamentalists or any other extreme group of leaders who are inflexible in their positions regardless of their religion. They are representative of a position of extremism, not a religion. The environmental message is an important one for all of us to take to heart. And while it was definitely a bit over done, it is still an excellent message to teach the world. <br /> <br />This is a glorious film. When it comes out on dvd, I'll be the first one to buy it in order to enjoy it over and over again.
B0000524E5|1.0|I'm not sure which is worse- the concept of the bar \\"Coyote Ugly.\\" or the movie about it. I suppose both. A lot is made about Piper Parabo's performance, as it were. But I just don't see it. I mean, you'd have to be able to act to receive such an accolade. And in this movie Parabo is a strident, sell a little T and A as far as one can w/o becoming a stripper with as much a grasp on the real world annoyance. The movie is a toy for high school/college age mopes who find places where the worst kept secret in the bar business- hiring hotties to sucker young, naiive men into spending money they can't afford- interesting places to hang out at. This is \\"Cocktail\\" in reverse, to an extent. This is one of those movies that creates a non-existing, pure utopia of a bar. The place where everyone basically laughs, cheers and sings in unison at a contrived, silly atmosphere that only exists in the minds of Hollywood execs, and college campuses to a much lesser extent. The dialogue also is equal to that of \\"Coctail\\"- pointless, been there before, dense dialogue. If you're young and have yet to be in touch with real life, see  this. It's a fantasy flick for escapism. If you're a quality film lover, run the other way!
0743298020|4.0|You absolutely must love the written word to appreciate The Thirteenth Tale. The old woman's hands were a \\"jumble of knuckles and rubies in her lap\\" - can you see it? Yes, the book wanders and meanders at times. It is reminiscent of novels from the nineteenth century, when mood was everything; when a reader had time to immerse him/herself in a pool of language and atmosphere and just float awhile.     I withheld a fifth star because, in my opinion, the ends were too neatly tied up, all the book-long agonies too quickly assuaged, all the wounds too successfully bandaged for the end to fulfill the promise spied in the first few chapters. But, to be fair, there really is no good way to end a good story.     Overall, I think I would describe Ms. Setterfield's style as equal parts Charlotte Bronte and Joyce Carol Oates, with a bit of Ruth Rendell in there for good measure. I anxiously await her next novel.
B000055Y0Y|2.0|This movie certainly had some strong actors and actresses in it and that with an interesting storyline landed it on my viewing list. <br /> <br />Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with this film.  I figured there would be a little more real suspense or \\"thrill\\" but it never materialized and instead just followed many of the usual plot events.  The biggest failure was the completely unneccessary cheesey romance between Eastwood and Russo. It was contrived, lame, and almost laughable. I had to rub my eyes to make sure I wasnt having a nightmare! <br /> <br />John Malkovich does a great job as the wackjob and is totally convincing in this role.  Unfortunately the script didnt do him enough justice and even his character did some staple moves.  Clint Eastwood was great as always but he did play his usual self. No problem here though, Clint was solid. <br /> <br />The film just fizzled as it went along and it started to get tiresome towards the very end.  The climax was rather anti-climactic except for the shooting scene which was kind of cool although I saw it coming a mile away.  There was not as much suspense as I was hoping for and the \\"thrill\\" was mostly missing. <br /> <br />What else can I say, watch it and make your own decision but overall I was not that impressed and the film let me down a bit after such glowing reviews.

B000H7JD4K|5.0|Once again Iron Maiden proves they are the greatest band in the world with this release.  Steve Harris is undoubtedly one of the finest bassists and songwriters ever; without 'Arry, there is no Maiden.  The three guitar onslaught of Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, and Janick Gers both compliment each other and stand out loud and clear with perfection.  Nicko McBrain continues to amaze me on the drums; he's a nut and one of the best drummers in the world.  And what can be said about Bruce Dickinson that hasn't already been said.  His voice is as strong now as it was back in the days of the Beast.  Incredible lyrics and incredible orchestration combine for what would be a Grammy winner if anyone who had any authority to say anything about it had any sense.  This band just keeps getting better and better and never disappoint, in the studio and live on tour.  They are the greatest band in the world.
B00005JPC4|4.0|This isn't one of those movies that would jump at you but on contrary, it would give you a lingering and satisfied quiet smile after watching it.  For the Francophiles, this is an unmissable experience and something to be savoured on the big screen.  It's plain obvious that this is a labour of love for Ridley Scott, the Director who owns a property himself at Provence.  Much efforts have been put in to get the right colour hues to complement the story and the domestic scenes captured on film is simply magical.  There's quite a bit of witty British dry jokes that are coming on and retro British songs from the olden years somehow fit into this movie brilliantly.  Unlike Diane Lane's Under the Tuscan Sun which is a bit forced, one word to describe this one is simply, \\"Charming\\".  Much criticism has been laid on Russell Crowes by critics and even viewers alike but personally, I think he's doing a wonderful job playing a character who has over the years lost his soul but inevitably redeeming it back in the end.  Overall, this movie is about love, life, friendship, wine, memory & Provence.  It would be appropriate to define this as Ridley Scott's homage or love letter to the land that he loves.  Once again, this movie proves the Director's versatility in tackling different genre.  A splendid movie with outstanding performances from all cast.  Highly recommended.
B00005JPCD|1.0|A movie filled by vulgar language with sexual hints. I don't understand why this is for \\"all audience\\". I brought my daughter to the theater to watch this movie because the preview looked adorable. However, we were so disappointed and disgusted by the movie that we quitted in the middle of the show.
0241003008|5.0|This was our first run in with Eric Carle. A friend at my office recommended this book as a Caldecott winner (which at the time I had never heard of) so I bought it. My son loved it 5 years ago and he still gets a kick out of it today. My 12 month old also loves it now too. Best of all, it's fun for parents to read.
B000FVQM2Y|2.0|Yes, it's well-written, and well-directed.  But I'm one of those people who simply does not buy the gimmick, this Neo-noir world inhabited only by adolescents.  Adolescent \\"detective.\\"  Adolescent chanteuse.  Adolescent femme fatale.  Adolescent gangsters. Adolescent everything.  The gimmick kills the story--kills it dead.  Good writing and good acting can't revive it. I think you have to take teenagers a lot more seriously than I do in order to enjoy this movie. Indeed, you have to take them at least as seriously as they take themselves in this movie (and that's pretty damn seriously).    It would have been much better using adult actors.  Adult stories need adult actors.  I'm not surprised this flick got such poor distribution.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I'll admit, I was rather late in picking this one up.  To be honest, I was a bit burnt on Dream Theater after _Train of Thought_ which is a fantastic, if sometimes exhausting, album.  (Sidenote: I also saw them on that tour and was there at the show where the guy fell out of the balcony.)  When I heard this was coming out, I held off for a long time, mainly because I had a backlog of albums to catch up on.  At the insistence of a friend, however, I checked it out and was very surprised (which seems to be a running theme) at what I heard.  <br /> <br />The album starts off well, with the Root of All Evil continuing what I've now deemed the Recovery Cycle (see also Glass Prison and This Dying Soul).  The song features one of my favorite chorus melodies in a long time.  The Answer Lies within is a quieter song that showcases the band's versatility.  It's probably the softest they've been since Scenes...  That's followed by These Walls, which picks up the tempo yet again before they go U2 on everyone with I Walk Beside You, a tune I like in spite of myself.  Panic Attack is the speedster of the album and proves that they haven't forgotten their metal side, as does Never Enough.  James Labrie gets the lyric credit for Sacrificed Sons, another religion-themed track that is less angry though more moving than TOT's In the Name of God.  Then, comes the best part of the show: Octavarium.  It shows everything that Dream Theater is about and more.  Portnoy's collaborations with Neal Morse shine through here, as Myung's bass really comes alive with a great, fat sound and Rudess's synths are warm and analog.  There's not much showmanship or many fireworks, but the song grows and builds from a quiet, Floydian exercise up to a huge crescendo that ends the album where it began.  The track alone is worth the price of admission. <br /> <br />One thing that struck me was the conciseness of the songs.  There are not as many technical fireworks, but it's still Dream Theater and the albumis stronger for it, making it an easier but no less interesting listen than previous records. Indeed, its subtleties are its strengths.  They have always been one of 'My Bands' and they proved why once again with this release.  Definitely one for the ages.
B000002O51|3.0|\\"Amanda,\\" \\"We're Ready\\" and \\"Cool the Engines\\" are the only tracks that really did it for me. Everything else sounded like an overwrought ballad, a stunted rocker or frilly trifles. It just didn't do it for me. For Boston fans, it's essential because it has \\"Amanda,\\" but in terms of being a solid album, it just isn't. There's too much filler and mediocrity for this qualify as a must-buy for average Joe.
B000GFLAI0|1.0|Why is Dylan taking sole credit on an album featuring a fair percentage of other peoples song writing ?  <br /> <br /> <br />Shame on you Bob.
B00006JK1T|5.0|Personally, I hated the first MiB film. Which makes me wonder why I even bothered watching the sequel, but I'm glad I did.  <br /> <br />I REALLY enjoyed MiB II. Its entertaining, its witty, the visuals are crisp, the story moves along quickly, and the dry humor is just hilarious. <br /> <br />I could watch this time after time and still enjoy it. It isn't over-stuffed like some sequels are. This movie was a delight.
B00005JPCA|1.0|I'm a huge Bond fan (owning all the movies on DVD and a good percentage on VHS as well as having read several of the books) and I just feel that this Bond did not fit the bill. There are several reasons: <br /> <br />1) Daniel Craig was neither suave nor debonair. Nor was he subtle either in humor or in killing. These are all characteristics that Bonds have always had. <br />2) Also Daniel Craig did not fit the physical specifications of a Bond. Namely he broke the long standing tradition of James Bond being a hairy dude. This is most notably mentioned in \\"You Only Live Twice.\\" <br />3) He changes his signature drink... \\"Martini shaken not stirred\\" <br />4) The continuity sucked. <br />a) Sure there is no timeline in Bond but this movie proposes to set one up. It's supposed to be the first and therefore the use of computers, cell phones and modern vehicles really ruined it. I understand the hope to use Craig in more than one movie but this one should have been set in the past while others could be set in present time.  <br />b) They say that the Cold War is over however it is quite obviously going on, what I guess now is, later on in the series. <br />c) They use Judi Dench as `M' when she is said to be the original M's replacement in \\"Goldeneye\\" how can she be both the original and the replacement? <br />5) No \\"Q\\" branch. <br />6) No hot girls in the \\"theme song\\" sequence <br /> <br />Craig just isn't that dynamic of an actor and I feel he has trumped even Lazenby as worst Bond. While Craig is still British he doesn't have a very thick accent, something I'd like to have seen, and he acts more like an American Rambo than a British MI6 agent.  <br /> <br />I feel like my only recourse in this is that it was released by Sony Pictures rather than MGM. This allows me to pretend it wasn't a real Bond film just like that other mistake \\"Never Say Never Again.\\"
B000025XKM|5.0|Captivating and poetic, the music is quiet and simple, yet richly woven textures of tones and thought. I love to listen to Pink Moon at night, while driving in my car.
B000002LCK|5.0|Usually I try to not be excessively succinct, but for this one, I'll say the following: <br /> <br />This is an essential 2 Disc set. Rarely are compilations this excellent. Extended A-side of majestic proportions. B-sides of vast or trifled status. Combine it all and you get a perfect set.
B00000JRTX|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I think Hugh Grant is drop-dead gorgeous. I would watch any movie with him in it. This is one of his best films, if not the best. It's funny without being desperate and touching without being depressing. The only thing I would change about it is the casting of Andie McDowell. She delivers her lines so poorly that it's distracting. If it weren't for her \\"performance\\", I might would have given this film five stars. Luckily, she doesn't have THAT many lines for a \\"lead\\" character. I've read that Four Weddings and a Funeral is the highest grossing British film ever and I can see why.
B00005JPCA|2.0|What a bore. I wasn't really excited to this the blonde bond but I went to see it anyway because the last one with pierce was so so good but anyway on with the review. This movie was boring. No gadgets that bond usually has. No witty conversations. If you watch it most of the time they aren't saying anything just chasing eachother and the casino scene is about 20 minutes too long. And the vilian with the bleeding eye? So what!!!! Eva as the bond girl was stupid. The other girl that got killed should have been the bond girl. Eva looked too homely to be considered hot. And oh the blonde bond, what ever his name is isn't hot either!
B000ICL3KG|2.0|Hopelessly misguided.  Overwhelmingly biographical.  Smartly directed. <br /> <br />Al Gore's never ending struggle to prove that mankind is destroying the earth and that the solution is international governmental control and primitive living reared its ugly head on the silver screen earlier this year and is now available on DVD!  Beware, though - that DVD is made of plastic, which is derived from a number of chemical compounds including - (gasp!) - oil.  The recipe for the movie, however, is 1 part science, 3 parts personal anecdotes, and 4 parts slideshow fun! <br /> <br />Mr. Gore has taken the liberty of inventing a scientific consensus (this is, of course after he invented the internet) on which to start his new campaign for president.  His movie is almost entirely about his own life.  A fair amount is devoted to his current struggle to advance the environmental movement, and what is left over is a small amount of very misleading science.  It isn't, necessarily, bad science - it is just far from representational.  However, I won't waste this review debating the scientific ideas advanced by Mr. Gore - there are plenty of other scientists and resources for that. <br /> <br />What needs to be recognized about this movie is that it is a campaign video and not an educational documentary.  There are components of informative dialogue and presentations, but this is really all about Al Gore, not global warming.  There is more discussion of how his political opponents have got in his way and in the way of his message than there is of actual solutions to the \\"problem.\\"  This is my big criticism.  The movie masquerades as a documentary to advance an environmental cause when it really intends to advance Al Gore's availability for political office.  Even in that light it still operates dishonestly. <br /> <br />Mr. Gore chastises the Bush administration for refusing to take action to stop global warming.  However, even when Gore was running the country with Bill Clinton, they did nothing.  In fact, Gore's proclamation in the movie that he tried diligently to get Kyoto passed but was stopped by the Republicans is bogus.  The Clinton administration found the protocol unworkable and challenged the fact that it only bound a few nations to action without timetables.  They never even submitted it to the Senate for ratification.  In this fashion, the movie continues with one dishonest claim after another. <br /> <br />In the end, the movie is full of misleading science and statistics, complete lies and fabrications, and it focuses more on the nobility of Gore than on any perceived global issue.  The only thing that makes me give it a second star is the fact that it was smartly directed and well edited.  The message that the movie intended to convey comes across loud and clear and with style - it's just not a message that anyone should hear or trust.
B000JLTRKE|3.0|I saw this movie on opening day, emotionally preparing myself as I did with United 93. True there WERE many emotional moments, good acting by the principal players and distinguishing choreography.<br /><br />BUT, I was sadly disappointed by the often controversial Oliver Stone's rendition of the events of that fateful day of 9/11/01. The movie was good but really just had the feel of a network/cable TV \\"Movie of the Week\\" movie about so many of the tragic events that occasionally occur, be it a coalmine collapse, earthquake, flood, etc. An okay touchy, feely movie but in reality just entertainment and just barely memorable due to 9/11. The storyline infact mentioned very little of the scope of the destruction of the World Trade Center, the attack on the Pentagon or the actions of the brave men and women on flight 93.<br /><br />For a true, heartfelt look at courage and heroism in action, try to catch the cable documentary \\"The Miracle of Stairway B\\" on The History Channel showing the real time events of the rescue of 16 survivors trapped in the remanents of the North Tower.<br /><br />IMHO, United 93 is far superior and in a complete league of its own. For parents with younger viewers, try to catch \\"Tiger Cruise\\", a fine DCOM (Disney Channel Original Movie) of a true life occurrence coinciding with the attack of the WTC.
B00005IC2H|3.0|I think this is a very well-made album by a creative and unique band. If you find this or any of Sigur Ros's other material to be \\"pretentious,\\" then you're barking up the wrong tree in the first place and would be better off listening to something of a different genre. <br /> <br />That being said, I honestly just can't get into it. I enjoyed \\"( )\\", and I love other spacey rock-ish type music, but... 2 years after buying it and repeatedly listening to it, it just doesn't do much for me. I'm chalking this up to a matter of personal taste. <br /> <br />I'd recommend this to anyone who has heard and enjoyed anything else by Sigur Ros, there's a very good chance you'll dig it. Pick it up and make up your mind for yourself.
B00005JPCA|5.0|I don't know how general audiences will take to a re-imagined, back-to-the-source, colder and harder James Bond as brought to the screen by a thoroughly believable Daniel Craig, but for my money, the team behind Casino Royale has shot some juice back into what had become a lackluster, farcical, and moribund series, reinvigorating the characters while dispensing with much of the nonsense and clutter that had accumulated over the years.      I haven't gone to a theatre to see a James Bond movie in decades, the last memorable outing probably On Her Majesty's Secret Service (one of the better efforts: good movie, bad Bond (Lazenby).  I had seen the various Bonds over the years on cable or DVD and the movies were always somewhat amusing,  well-produced with some great stunts, but they had become so comic-booky and increasingly self-parodying that I found them hopelessly silly and overblown.  I found the Roger Moore era especially egregious and dismal while the attempt in the Timothy Dalton phase to sort-of get back to a grittier Bond was a nice try, but no cigar.  Pierce Brosnan's films were good, but by now so cluttered with nonsense that his last, with the invisible car and the villain's Ice Palace (nee Fortress of Solitude) only served to demonstrate that Bond had become Spiderman.    I had read with relish Ian Fleming's series as a kid and loved the first 3 or 4 Bond movies, with From Russia with Love and Goldfinger favorites, and closest to the novels.  Thunderball was okay, but I started to lose it with You Only Live Twice and the volcano fortress and rocket gobbling, Donald Pleasence doing Blofeld as Dr. Evil, and all the rest of the tripe they began piling onto the series.    So we come back to the first book in the series, Casino Royale, and the producers have shrewdly gambled on taking Bond Back to Basics.  I think they have succeeded admirably, and hope they will find an audience for the newer, harsher Bond.  Judging by some of the reviews from Bond loyalistsI read here, many of them also welcome a new breath of life in what was becoming a stale and outdated franchise.      You have terrific stunts with some really exceptional physical stunt work.  Fights that are nasty and brutal with pain that appears to be painful, and a double-O assassin who looks and acts like an assassin. Judy Dench is a marvelous M.  We have dispensed with Q and all the fantastical and silly gadgets for less but more appropriate equipment.  There aren't a bevy of Bond girls, but when you have the gorgeous Eva Green, you really don't need anyone else.  By and large the cliched quips are gone in favor of some dialogue that is actually kind of adult and often pretty snappy (thank you Paul Haggis).  You have villains that actually inhabit this planet and not Marvel Comics land.  There is a story with some twists and a beginning for Bond that lays the groundwork for some intriguing possibilities as to where they want to take him.  And you have Daniel Craig doing his damndest to re-define the role and make it his own.    Take away the Bond name and legacy, and you would still have a hell of a  good movie here.  It looks great.  It is richly produced with care, and is smartly directed.  It goes places Bond movies in later years seem to have feared to tread.  I enjoyed it immensely, and yes, I would pay to go see the next one in the theatre.  By bringing Bond back closer to Fleming's creation, and by bringing in an actor without the expected, traditional look but who is a bloody good actor, and by dispensing with great heaps of the rubbish, they've hooked me back into it.  I hope others find it as entertaining as I did.
0156012197|4.0|Just like the expression \\"Youth is wasted on the young,\\" I think one can also say that \\"children's\\" literature may be wasted on the young. I don't know that little kids could really appreciate all the valuable lessons that this gem has to offer. It would take a savvy mother or teacher reading this to them in order to help explain the subtleties that might go undetected by the casual younger reader. I almost feel like this book is meant for adults, or at least teens. It highlights the role of perspective, of appreciating the small and large things in life, even of politics if one chooses, so beautifully! Definitely something everyone should read.
B000002H33|5.0|Simply stated,this is the numero-uno of all metal albums.Nothing is even<br /><br />close to touching this awesome work.
1878424319|5.0|If you are seeking a thought-provoking bang for your personal-psychology buck, befriend this book.  <br /> <br />Ostensibly, the author attributes his inspiration for the four agreements to the Toltec, but the precepts work in most all cultural and temporal settings. <br /> <br />Practicing the simple insights shared in this book have had a profound impact on my life over the past two years since fervently reading the book aloud with a friend over the course of a night. Pulled along by the comparative explorations into personal styles, we stayed up all night and still carry the clarity with us. <br /> <br />Invariably, whenever I find myself in a torn or tormented situation, I can back-track to the root cause of my conflict being my violating one (or more) of these Four Agreements:  <br /> <br />1. Don't take things personally <br />2. Don't make assumptions <br />3. Always be impeccable with my word <br />4. Always do my best <br /> <br />In fact, straight-away after reading the book, my thornier issues wrestled mightily to deny the power of these perspectives, only later succumbing to their wisdoms. Most often, I found/find myself making an assumption and then taking it personally when the details fail to bolster my assumption. The worst case is when I am assuming that I am not making an assumption when I clearly am doing just that, like whenever I rant about being \\"right.\\" <br /> <br />I encourage you to read and reread this book. If you can, read or have it read to you aloud.  You are likely to learn a few things about yourself and about other people in your life. <br /> <br />The Four Agreements makes me think of Victor Frankl's small and very powerful book, Man's Search for Meaning, about the elements for surviving difficult times and finding happiness in life. Maybe the equation is that by living the four agreements, the meaning in a person's life emerges from the simple grace of those choices.
B000HIVO64|4.0|I heard so many positive things from the other music lovers in my life, I finally had to sit down and listen to Beck's new album.  I love it when a great artist not only puts out new music, but ensures that it is something fresh and exciting.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|Given the state of world relations, many have questioned whether it was right to make this film, re-enacting as it does, the events of the First Crusade 800+ years ago and it has been accused of exacerbating Muslim/ Christian relations. Strangely, it has also been accused, in the right-wing press at least as being pro-arab, which I fail to see, as it concentrates almost exclusively on the Christian side. <br />Whether you like this film or not though, and leaving aside for a moment its \\"political\\" implications will depend a lot on whether you enjoy historical/ military epics. If you do, this film is pretty spectacular, though not all that realistic. Surely in the 12th century war was not as efficient as it is today... <br />But let's get back to the central issue. I don't think this film takes sides - maybe that's why the right wing objected to it - War is hell and the title of the film \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is very clearly ironic. The central character, Balian, the Christian defender of Jerusalem, a solid performance by Orlando Bloom, says as much, and goes on to question who Jerusalem ( over which the Crusaders and Muslims were fighting) really belongs to anyway. This is really key. The fact also that Saladin is not portrayed as a brutal heathen, but as a knight bound by the same rules of chivalry as the Christians, should surely not be seen as blaspemous. <br /> <br />I hope this film gets a decent audience not only in the West but also in areas of the world not open normally to Western Cinema. It doesn't belittle the often heroic values of those who believe that fighting for the sake of one's religion is right, but it does question the likely outcome. For that reason I would rate this film \\"well worth seeing\\".
B00005JPCA|4.0|Casino Royale is definitely one of the best Bond movies I've seen. <br /> <br />Daniel Craig is the new James Bond, and he's much brawnier (and blonder) than his predecessors.  Craig does a great job reinventing a character that has been played previously by five actors in 20 films. <br /> <br />The debut of a new Bond, however, is not Casino Royale's only indication that the Bond franchise is going in a new direction.  Going back in time to Bond's promotion to \\"double-oh status\\", Casino Royale cuts many of the characters that were regulars in previous Bond films, including Q and Miss Moneypenny.  Gone are the days when Bond killed villains with super-gadgets; the new Bond relies on his gun and his fists to get the job done. <br /> <br />Casino Royale introduces a new, more human James Bond, while still managing to retain the clever lines and unparalleled action sequences that made the previous films such a success. <br /> <br />The \\"romance\\" dialogues between Bond and Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) are the only things keeping Casino Royale from 5-stars.  These scenes are rather corny and seem abrupt and misplaced plot-wise. <br /> <br />4-stars - it's worth it.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|I'm saddened to read a couple of the reviews bagging the new CD.  I remember when Closer first came out some people didn't like at all, but now they know the songs they love it.  I think this is the same thing.  I don't want Josh to release album after album where it all sounds the same.  I want him to grow and diversify and show us the incredible voice and talent for interpretation that he has.  I believe this album does just that.  I love it.  I have it in the car and now the melodies run through my head all day.  The words to most of the songs are really beautiful and Josh makes them better.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion but to call these songs horrible and say they are not suited to his voice seems a bit harsh....even if you're not used to them yet.  He is showing us that his voice is suited to all different styles of music and that will widen his appeal enormously.  I hope that once the songs are as familiar to these people as they are to me, they will change their opinion and love the CD too.  I love it....every single song....it took me a while to like some of them, but now I love them all individually and for all different reasons.  I think Josh is growing up as a singer and I can't wait to see what else he will throw our way in the future.

B000HC2LI0|4.0|There is no question in my mind the \\"The West Wing\\" was one of the greatest drama series on television ever. And if you've been holding out on buying the DVDs until this box set was released then I would suggest you part with some cash immediately. The issue for a lot of people reading these reviews, however, is going to be whether or not they are going to want to replace individual box sets with this release. I'm not going to suggest to you what the best move is, although in the next few days you're going to see my box sets on sale, but this is really a decision on whether or not you want a beautifully packaged set. That is what this is. The 'leather' folder the disks come in is perfect in terms of design for this series. The two 'books' that the set contains are glossy, and the pictures  are beautiful. It is also a welcome change to see seasons 1 to 4 discs one -sided as opposed to the previous release. The individual folders that the disks here come in are sturdy enough and again well designed. However, I can't spot any additional extras on the discs. The foreward by Aaron Sorkin also isn't new - it's taken from the first Scriptbook that was released. So if you are a Wingnut, chances are you've seen everything here before and as I said it really comes down to the packaging and the fact that you were going to buy Season 7 anyway so why not splurge on this. I'm giving it 4 stars as opposed to 5 because I can't quite forgive the makers for Season 5 and also because it would have been nice of them to include something extra for the Wingnuts here considering it is us who are really going to be purchasing this set.
B000G759LW|4.0|christina aguilera is arguably one of the best vocalists of our time.  This girl effortlessly belts out keys that can make the hairs on your arm stand up(not the annoying shrill dog whistle that mariah constantly unnecessarily throws in songs)Her talent can not be denied...her choices..well..lol<br /><br />Ms. Aguilera has definitely come a long way from the bubblegum sound of her first cd(which she is forgiven for).  I really fell in love with her on Stripped, which in my opinion, was a brutally personal album.  Her vocal were incredible, and all of her songs felt raw and uncensored.  So i was definitely counting down the days to her new release.<br /><br />i won't say i don't like Back 2 Basics, but it was a bit of a disappointment. i understand and even appreciate her decision to do something different, but a whole \\"vintage\\" cd got a little tiring after awhile. At times (Slow Down Baby, Makes Me Wanna Pray) christina seemed to let the great music eclipse her awesome voice and that was a bit of a let down.  She also had a few filler songs(Still Dirty) that seemed like an afterthought.<br /><br />Christina shines when plays the diva that she is...she absolutely delivers on Ain't No Other Man(think Amerie's One Thing...but by someone that can sing)and her mournful wails on Hurt are enough to make you forgive her for whatever she did.  My favorite, and by far the standout track is Save Me From Myself, where Christina's gentle voice intertwines beautifully with the wistful strings of the violoin and guitar.  This track is actually one of my favortie songs EVER.<br /><br />So while the album had material that could have been left on the cutting floor, it also offers truly beautiful music.
B000IOM1RI|5.0|All the complaints I see have to do with the album being too short. Like others have said: this is a soundtrack- not a full album. I was able to go to a sneak preview of this movie (which \\"Rocks Your F'n Socks Off!!!!!) and you can see the relevance. Taken in context with the movie, this album fully deserves 5 stars.
0618680004|4.0|After hearing an interview with Richard Dawkins on NPR, I decided to buy the God Delusion . The text is very engrossing, and I could not put it down--I read the entire book in a matter of days. As an Atheist, I found it to be an excellent summary for the case against religion, However, I must disagree with some of the other reviewers who said the text was groundbreaking or Earth shattering--as I read more on the subject I find that The God Delusion is mostly an updated version of existing arguments.<br /><br />For instance, in the chapter \\"Why There Almost Certainly Is No God,\\" -what Dawkins' calls the central argument of his book--he argues that while creationists believe that evolution is too improbable and that creation by deity solves this improbability, in actually there is an exponential level improbability added by supposing a deity, since we now have to answer the questions \\"who made God\\", and \\"who made who made God\\", and so forth. The same argument can be found in Bertrand Russell's \\"Why I am not a Christian\\" from 1927 (and Russell credits the idea to John Stuart Mill, from the latter's Autobiography), although not as scientifically postulated. Many of his other points, such as his counters of Aquinas' Proofs can also be found in the Russell text.<br /><br />From a stylistic point of view, it felt like it has been written as one long stream of consciousness dialog, with the reader following behind the easily distracted Dawkins. At times, this approach can be interesting, but other times it is very frustrating. I would have preferred him to stay more on point. The text as it stands may make it more approachable for casual readers, however.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent primer to modern secular beliefs, but I would encourage people who liked this book to continue reading other books on this topic. The Appendix and Works Cited in this book would be an excellent place to start.

B000HCO840|3.0|Between 2 and a half to 3 stars! <br />\\"Ratner, emphasis on the RAT, what were you thinking?\\"  Eliminating two primary characters and never ever really exploring the powers of the Dark Phoenix is just idiotic!  There were a couple of deleted scenes that I would have included in the original release which would have given more substance to her \\"uncanniness.\\"  But she came in with sort of a wimper and went out the same way. That's not to say what we ended up with,wasn't entertaining, but a lot more exploration could have brought the film to a more cataclysmic crescendo! <br /> <br />As far as the Stan Lee Colletor's edition DVD as well as other Region 1 editions - what a croc!  Although the comic book included is nice, what's the point of using two separate menus, a brotherhood access and an X-men access, only to show the same movie and same features on each?  Where is any behind the scenes features that other regions got?  I thought at least the Brotherhood version would have edited in some of the better or longer deleted scenes or maybe repositioned some of the various scenes, but there was absolutely no difference -- nothing!!!!  What idiot decided this was a good idea?  It was an absolute useless endeavor.  Given that I went out of my way to purchase the Region 1 version, I should have spent my money purchasing an Aussie version instead which includes more behind the scenes features and for basically the same price (or less0.  Shame on DVD producers for screwing the American Market - in hopes of reaping more gold by forcing them purchase the upgraded DVD (when it comes out) that will give the Region 1 market everything else the rest of the world already has (except Stan Lee's comic). For Shame!!!!
B000GRTQSE|5.0|Listen to it where you can here all the sounds, not in your car. <br />Ive been with Dylan since since 1964, and this one is a masterpiece of music perfection. Did not get it much at first, but after a few listens on a good piece of equipment, my computer, not in the car, I heard so much more. <br /> <br />This album is one of his very best, all the songs are excellent and memorable. Buy it, enjoy it, like a great glass of wine, and relax as you listen. Definately the grammy winner.
B000FL7CAK|2.0|Season 1 of Veronica Mars took me by surprise, and I really enjoyed the ride.   The second season, however, doesn't live up to the quality of the first.  Instead of one large mystery, in season two viewers are treated to several smaller mysteries to solve.  There's nothing wrong with that approach, but it seemed that as fast as one mystery skien got solved, another would pop right up without any resolution for the first.  Many episodes ended with my friends and I turning to one another and asking, \\"Is that it?  Where's the rest of it?\\"  This happened quite a bunch, with the child abuse investigation episode as perhaps the most jarring.  Are we really supposed to believe someone as determined as Veronica would just pick up and call it quits because she gets a slap on the wrist?  That's totally out of character, yet we never see that family, the abused girl, or hear about the incident again.       That type of confusion and weak plot points kept popping up.  The \\"major\\" villain of the season comes out of left field to be the murderer, and his motivation for murder ends up being really weak and unbelievable.  Because of the all the loose ends, go-nowhere plots, and the surprise villain who was probably a surprise to the writers up until deadline, I'm giving Season 2 a 2 star rating.  Season 2 of Veronica Mars still has some funny dialogue, and some clever episodes, but it doesn't deserve all the 4 and 5 star reviews I've seen.  I'll continue to watch, however, as Veronica Mars has a lot of promise.  Hopefully the producers can get things in gear for season 3!
B000002UAX|5.0|For many Beatles fans, Sgt. Pepper is the pintacle of their acheivement as a band. Naturally, I have to agree for the most part.  But the White Album is the place, where the songs were their most mature, most focused. I could write a book about this album, my experiences with it growing up, my psychedelic investigations with this as the soundtrack, and later, the way I learned music by playing each song off this album at one point or another. On the White Album, you can still hear all the cliches that the Beatles pioneered on their two year psychedelic journey. For instance, Harrison still uses sitar, but it serves the song so much better, in LONG LONG LONG. Lennon never wrote anything more psychedelic than REVOLUTION NUMBER NINE, which of course is filled with backward sounds. I love that song, by the way. At the time, Lennon defended REVOLUTION #9 by saying that in the future, everybody would be writing songs like that. Well, guess what. Go listen to modern Rap, Mash ups, House music, electronica. Its all about taking samples, looping them, and making a backround soundscape. This song, like so many on this album, set a musical template that is still followed. It predicted heavy metal with HELTER SKELTER, it predicted true reggae with OB LA DI, and the blues revival with YER BLUES. More than anything, it showed that the modern musician has NO CONSTRAINTS of style. The only borders you have, are the borders you chose. We still get albums that show a plethoria of styles, and those albums are ALWAYS going to be compaired to the White Album. I doubt that we would have had albums like the Clash's SANDINISTRA, without the White album. The greatness of this album can be heard just from the acoustic demos that were recorded in George's house, after the 4 month LSD rehab the band were at in India, AKA, the Maharishi's summer camp. Each song was meticulously assembled, guitar parts worked on and perfected, and done in a GROUP SETTING. Again, another myth that needs to be overcome, is that this album is a series of solo numbers. Even songs like McCartney's I WILL, have John and Ringo on the song. The only two solo numbers were WHY DONT WE DO IT IN THE ROAD, where Paul overdubbed all the instruments himself, and REVOLUTION NUMBER NINE, where Lennon and yoko assembled the tapes themselves. As for this album being a random series of songs, in no way is that true. I have never heard an album were the sequence of songs has greater depth, linkage and poinancy. It starts out with the BEACH BOYS take off, goes into a take off of the Canterbury scene folk sound, then into a parody of the Beatles themselves in GLASS ONION, then into Paul's reggae/Ska song, OB LA DI OB LA DA. WILD HONEY PIE is a sort of acid folk song, followed by BUNGALOW BILL, a protest song against senseless hunting as a metaphor for senseless killing during war, into a type of rythym and blues, where the woman is the guitar, in the incredible WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS. Happiness is a Warm Gun, is no doubt a nod to the surreal rock writers like ZAPPA. But this is how the album works. You move from style to style, with each style clashing with the previous song and the following song. Superficially it's an album of clever homages to various styles of rock, sure, but its also all about how these styles remain the same....ROCK. Ever wonder how reggae, surfer music, folk rock, Zappa's wierdness, the country rock of the BYRDS, Psychedelic rock, rock ballads, hard rock, BLUES ROCK, etc, all evolved in a matter of just over TEN YEARS? This album is the text book of rock's evolution from ELVIS right up to the most far out variation beyond rock. There is another internal structure to this album, that becomes clearer as you listen to the album repeatedly over the years. Each clash from song to song, becomes more and more extreme, as the album proceeds. At first, the early clashes are not as jarring, and not as noticable. However, by the time you reach REVOLUTION NUMBER NINE, which isas weird as music CAN become, it's followed by the most corny song possible, that can still be called rock: GOOD NIGHT. So there you have it. Rock is all about constrast, variety, and evolution. This is what really makes this such a complete success. During the 90 minutes of music, the Beatles have shown the history of rock, and music as a whole, and done it in such a way, that simularities and contrasts are pointed out every step of the way. So many bands work years, just to develope ONE SOUND, yet the Beatles by this time, had developed and mastered EVERY POSSIBLE TYPE OF ROCK MUSIC possible. AND, they did it to perfection. I'd like to address a few more observations about the album's theme and over-arching structure. There are a lot of internal links, between songs that are often mentioned as well, like all the \\"ANIMAL SONGS\\" that were placed on the original \\"SIDE TWO\\" of the first album. (ROCKY RACCOON, BLACKBIRD, MARTHA MY DEAR which was about Paul's dog, and PIGGIES.) For me, just the way that side lyrically flows shows great thoughtfulness in arrangement of titles and themes. If Psychedelia is about a KALIDESCOPE of sounds, than in many ways, that is what was achieved here. But instead of the deep layering of random sounds, like ONLY A NORTHERN SONG, you get a montage of styles, all rammed up against each other. One of the true losses of the age of CDs, is that we can no longer recieve the 8 by 10 glossy photos of each band member, and the large fold out poster with all the various photos, that help to underscore the album's theme. FIRST OFF, you are seeing the Beatles as four seperate individuals on this album, just like the individual photos, instead of a group shot. BUT ALSO, you are seeing an apparently random collection of songs, just as the poster is a huge work of little photos and snap shots, of the Beatle's musical world, that merges into a cohestive whole, if you step back and see it all at once. This world of styles and sounds the Beatles intimately shared with each other. In many ways the PURE WHITE COVER is another comment for their sound. THE MULTICOLORED WORLD OF PSYCHEDELIC have merged, just like all the colors of light merge back to the pure white light where they originate, if mixed together. Of course, making the cover a minimalist artwork, individually numbered, was marvelous. Just one more attempt by the Beatles to offer their audience ART, and not just a rock record stuffed in a cardboard sleeve with a photo on the front, and the list of songs on the back. I have only mentioned things like structure, theme and intent here. As for the execution of the songs, their quality, their timelessness, all i can offer someone is this recommendation. Buy the album, and live with it for a few decades.  Maybe you can hear the mistakes they made. I can't. Almost fourty years after the album was recorded, it't still making ALL TIME TOP TEN lists. I suspect that in another fourty years, that will remain true as well.as weird as music CAN become, it's followed by the most corny song possible, that can still be called rock: GOOD NIGHT.

076790592X|4.0|Every now and then a person comes along that inspires more than just a close-knit group of people around, they inspire the world, or at least a part of it. This person was Morrie. <br /> <br />I was surprised to see that this book was copyrighted in 1997. Nine years have gone by, and I haven't read this book until now. Mitch Albom, with his usual simplistic-styled writing (probably because of his journalism background) tells a story about his old college professor that will make you think long and deep about life itself. If nothing else, after reading this book, you will want to reevaluate your life and how you view and interact with the world.  <br /> <br />William Faulkner once said, \\"The young man or woman writing today has forgotten the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing because only that is worth writing about, worth the agony and the sweat.\\" Albom proves Faulkner right, even if this isn't fiction. He paints a visual image of his own \\"heart in conflict with itself\\" by listening to his \\"coach\\" and looking at the world in this new and vivid way. <br /> <br />This book should be read by everyone. It's relatively short (I finished it in a little over two hours). So, take an afternoon with a few extra hours and enjoy yourself, possibly seeing truths that you may have never seen before.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This movie is just as good as I remembered. It's a classic Disney fairy tale, full of love, longing, fear, action, and beautiful songs. And the scene with Sebastian and the chef is priceless! If you haven't seen it yet, you can't miss this film!
B00005JPC7|3.0|It's hard not to smile at \\"Stranger Than Fiction,\\" a sweet-smelling potpourri of dry comedy, romance and \\"get-busy-livin'\\" philosophy. I wanted to dislike it for its faulty logic and gimme-a-hug sentiment, but it's just too well-executed to be trapped by its shortcomings.    I laughed (a little) and rooted for Will Ferrell to get the girl. On this day, in this cinematic wasteland, it'll do. Think of it as a witty chaser to the craziness of \\"Borat.\\"    Ferrell is Harold Crick, an IRS auditor who has reduced his life to numbers: brushstrokes on his teeth, steps to the bus stop. Director Marc Forster cleverly illustrates Harold's fixation with helpful white graphics that flash before the screen. It's needless and a little repetitive, but it's a nice touch and the better to distract you from the story written by Zach Helm.    At some point, Harold's life begins to intersect with a novel written by Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), who has unknowingly made Harold her main character. Harold hears her voice narrating the events of his life in his head, and it drives him nuts.    [...].    So he visits a couple of doctors, who think he has schizophrenia. He is eventually directed to literature professor Jules Hilbert, played by Dustin Hoffman, who agrees to help. If some author is narrating his life, Hilbert tells Harold, he should first figure out if the story's a tragedy or comedy.    Eiffel, of course, is intending a tragedy - all of her main characters die - but she has writer's block. She can't think of a way to kill Harold.    Is it possible to enjoy a movie while mentally eviscerating its logic?    \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" makes about as much sense as a 4-foot giraffe. How did Harold end up in Kay's book? If she has writer's block and has theoretically already written the narration Harold's hearing, why is he hearing it now? Why does the narration disappear for half of the movie?    The inevitable comparison is to Charlie Kaufman's works, including \\"Adapation,\\" \\"Being JohnMalkovich\\" and \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\\" Put simply, Kaufman's better at it; his scripts create a device - whether it's a portal or a memory-erasing program - that, while unreal, at least give the audience some ground rules.    \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" really has none. In some scenes Harold works outside the narration, while in others he's living out the narration. But he's only doing that because ? oh, never mind. \\"Minority Report\\" it isn't. Just flow with it.    Ferrell is low-key and funny, and he surprisingly generates chemistry with Gyllenhaal, who is asked to make a speech about cookies sound sexy. And she does it, twisting \\"macadamia\\" into erotic prose. Forster gives Hoffman some freedom to make an eccentric character. Thompson looks awful, but plays miserable pretty well.    It's easy to sense where the script is going. It goes there, there's a false climax then a real one, and then it arrives the kind of charity and goodness that is totally inexplicable, yet warm and gooey-centered.    \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" has a sharp visual polish and keeps slipping asides in its narrative to keep the jokes fresh.    It's a professional effort - handsome, even. It debases the theories of quantum physics, but if a movie takes the time to put on a suit, mix in some nifty music and have one of those collage endings that feels like the sun rising again, well, shoot - put me down for two boxes of the Shortbreads and one box of the Thin Mints.
B00005JPCA|4.0|Casino Royale is a very good movie, but it is only so-so as a Bond movie. This new incarnation clearly draws a lot of from the Bourne Identity films. That makes for an enjoyable movie if judged simply on its own terms, but we've come to expect more from Bond. It's clear that Hollywood can make a more realistic spy action movie than the Bond series, as the Bourne producers and others have shown. But Bond would do better to stay Bond.    James Bond movies are about opulence, both in the character and in the overall production. First off, Bond is character who can savor the finer things in life as well as fight the bad guys. It's the ability to do both simultaneously that makes him so unique. Daniel Craig's Bond is an amazing bare-knuckle fighter, but he does not enjoy the finer things. If anything, in this film, he seems to hold them in contempt. Many people have commented that Craig's Bond is more like the character of Fleming's novels. But frankly, most of us aren't into Bond because of the books. We're into the movie character. The template for the film Bond was created by director Terence Young as a unique blend of rough and refined, and no other spy or action character can match that. Connery and Brosnan got that balance right. So far, Craig does not.    Secondly, Bond movies are about the sort of locations, stunts, and gadgets that make you say, 'Wow, I've never seen that before!'. The problem is that this sets a high bar for each new Bond film. And sometimes (actually often) they get cartoonish trying to impress, such as with Die Another Day. But even when it gets too over-the-top, it's still like nothing else you've seen. The new film doesn't offer much of that. The early chase scene with that new run-and-jump fad (whatever that's called) is really cool, something we haven't seen before on the big screen. But that's about it. There's no big finale, just a little shootout in collapsing building with a bad guy we've just met. (And that shootout comes after someplot contrivances in the final third of the film that are full of huge gaps in logic.)    It's not that I think that the Bond movies shouldn't try new things. The stripped down torture scene in Casino Royale is great, a welcome change from often ridiculous scenes in earlier films where Bond is hung by a burning thread over a tank of acid filled with sharks with lasers mounted on them (like something out of the Batman tv shows). Likewise, the relationship between Craig and Eva Green is the best in a Bond film since On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Craig is clearly a talented actor. I can only hope that in the next movie Craig and the filmmakers can keep the fresh energy of Casino Royale, but bring back some of the opulence that sets the Bond movies apart from even the best of the Bournes.
B00005JPAJ|5.0|\\"Babel\\" is poetry, building on its humble, multi-layered opening act into a remarkable, crushing peak of emotion before closing on a cathartic shot of such visual power that the camera pulls back into eternity and drags memories of the total experience along with it. Brave. Difficult. Tense. Masterful. <br /> <br />Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro González Inarritu, this is the final in their trilogy of complex, literate films exploring the human condition. \\"Amores Perros\\" and \\"21 Grams\\" were the flowering of their narrative skills. \\"Babel\\" is the best of them; it's also the easiest to follow and the least concerned with applying a fierce narrative logic to its jumbled storyline. <br /> <br />There are four threads: A family of goat herders in Morocco; a married couple (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) on an Moroccan tourist bus; an illegal immigrant (Adriana Barraza) watching the couple's children back in San Diego; and a deaf Japanese girl named Chieko (Rinko Kikushi) whose beautiful eyes peer out at a world of moving mouths and empty words. <br /> <br />Arriaga and Inarritu weave these global plotlines together, yet the movie is determined to be intimate. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto employs so many close-ups that we finally see Pitt's age around his eyes. When a character is hit, we see the blood washing over his whiskers. We see the tears developing in the corners of Chieko's eyes. <br /> <br />We learn things about them. The illegal nanny's nephew (Gael Garcia Bernal) listens to music a little too loud and taunts authority a little too much. Chieko pretends to understand her sexuality, but is in fact so shy and sweet and hungry for contact that she cozies up to a new friend and says \\"You smell good!\\" <br /> <br />In the Moroccan family, there are two brothers. The younger boy is more of a man than the older one. He likes to watch his sister take off her clothes then find a nook in the mountainside to think about her. <br /> <br />What emerges, really, is a portrait of human frailty and brokenness. What suffering these characters endure! Not necessarily physical pain - although Blanchett's character is shot near the movie's beginning - but emotional and spiritual emptiness.  <br /> <br />Loneliness is suffering. To feel cheap is to suffer. To fear the police is suffering. To know you've made an unforgettable mistake that wipes your former life right off the chalkboard - that's an intense kind of suffering. Some of the characters in \\"Babel\\" find redemption; some of them are swept away. <br /> <br />It seems unrelated to the rest of the movie, and it basically is, but the filmmakers invest the most in Chieko's story. To look at the girl is to want to hug her, but this isn't a girl who wants to be hugged. What she thinks she wants and is ready for reveals itself after a rapturous sequence in a Tokyo disco. <br /> <br />From the third row of the theater, which is where \\"Babel\\" ought to be watched, Kikuchi is unforgettable. Give her every award. When Chieko finally releases all of her rage in muted sobs and asks, at long last, for empathy instead of exploitation, it is a crucial turning point. The movie would seem less without it. <br /> <br />Which is not to say \\"Babel\\" is everyone. It begins slowly. Pitt and Blanchett are relegated to less meaty roles. Some viewers won't like the movie's non-linear, out-of-order structure. And some have levied the \\"Crash\\" critique against it, dredging up the backlash that pelted last year's Academy Award winner for Best Picture. <br /> <br />I thought \\"Crash\\" was pretty effective, although it went off the rails in its final scenes. But \\"Babel,\\" while surreal, is more organic and believable. It integrates the use of several languages into the narrative, but doesn't pummel the point home. Arriaga and Inarritu aren't erecting paradigms and straw men so ideologies can collide. <br /> <br />No. \\"Babel\\" is just about us. When we're scared. When we're happy. When we're hurt, or angry, or panicked or lustful. When we're the middle of the world or at the end of it. It is sincerity without the smarminess or sap, executed in visual ecstasy. It's one of the best movies of the year. <br />
B00006LLNU|4.0|This is a nice release by the Icelandic group Sigur Ros that is very heavy on sullen and brooding atmospheres.  Although I loved the highly experimental debut, this 2002 album, while more polished and uniform, is also very enjoyable.  For me, this band is all about mood and emotional sophistication.  The lineup on the album includes J&oacute;n Thor Birgission (vocals, guitar), Kjartan Sveinsson (keyboards, electric piano), Georg H&oacute;lm (bass guitar) and Orri P&aacute;ll Dýrason (drums).  These guys work well as an ensemble and are masters of texture and atmosphere.<br /><br />Although not normally part of my reviews, the track listing was absent from the liner notes, so I have reproduced them here courtesy of ProgArchives: (1) Vaka, (2) Fyrsta, (3) Samskeyti, (4) Nj&oacute;snav&eacute;lin, (5) &Aacute;lafoss, (6) E-bow, (7) Daudalagio and (8) Popplagio.  The total album running length is 71:45.<br /><br />The eight tracks feature a similarly slow tempo, tortured minor chords and washes of sound generated with synthesizers, electric guitars, and most notably, technology including the e-bow, which has been around since 1976 or so - indeed, the group has dedicated a nearly 9:00 minute track to this small wonder.  For those of you that are curious, the e-bow is a hand-held device that utilizes an electromagnetic field to produce a sound reminiscent of using a bow on the guitar strings.  As it is used on the album, it produces very eerie tones, which are perfectly suited for this dark music.<br /><br />Drums and percussion are not as pronounced as on the debut, although they do appear every so often.  This may have been deliberate, because excessive percussion might have spoiled the ambience.  One of the most distinctive aspects of the Sigur Ros sound are the vocals, which are presented in a high pitched \\"choir boy\\" falsetto.  As an editorial comment, one of my favorite prog vocalists (Peter Hammill of Van der graaf Generator) also used a falsetto in the early-mid 1970s, so hearing this vocal technique being used by a modern band was pretty exciting.  One other neat thing that the group has borrowed are lyrics sung in a fabricated language called Hopelandic.  Magma did something similar to this in the early-mid 1970s.<br /><br />The album package is pretty cool and features very delicate pages that simply feature the ghostly outlines of various wintry landscapes and nothing else. One of the more tasteful album packages I have come across in fact.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good album by a fairly interesting new band that is still interested in experimenting - much like the progressive rock bands from the 1970s in fact.  Very enjoyable stuff.rn band was pretty exciting.  One other neat thing that the group has borrowed are lyrics sung in a fabricated language called Hopelandic.

B000I5X81K|3.0|After setting the bar so high with his first 2 cd's, Groban's 3rd effort had no chance of making the same grade.  Although it is not a complete disappointment, it is inconsistant and awkwardly arranged.  The title track, Awake, isn't even included, except on the \\"special edition\\"! He does save the best for last, but it's a long wait to get there.
B000GG4Y32|4.0|Even at its epic length of 195 minutes, Warren Beatty's quadruple hat trick as producer, director, co-screenwriter (with Trevor Griffiths) and star of this 1981 historical drama feels surprisingly intimate despite periodic efforts at David Lean-style grandiosity. Finally on DVD in a pristine print transfer, it's hard to believe it's been a quarter century since I've seen this movie, yet it still casts an intriguing spell probably because Beatty seems so enraptured by the turbulent story of John Reed, the American journalist-turned-Communist activist who provided a vital and controversial first-hand account of the Russian Revolution of 1917, \\"Ten Days That Shook the World\\".<br /><br />The film itself covers the last five years of the young writer's life (he was only 32 when he died), and Beatty smartly uses talking heads by way of 31 surviving eyewitnesses of the period as a means to explain the context of the story being told. Covering the full political spectrum from left to right, none are identified outright, but a few are quite famous like writer Henry Miller, journalist Adela Rogers St. John and comedian George Jessel. This approach allows the core of the movie to be the love story between Reed and his wife Louise Bryant, a fellow writer who became his companion on his first trip to Russia. Theirs is a tempestuous relationship driven by their increasing politicization and complicated by adultery and conflicting priorities. They socialize in an elite circle, which includes socialist writer Max Eastman, political anarchist Emma Goldman and playwright Eugene O' Neill, with whom Bryant has a passionate affair.<br /><br />Divided into two parts (and consequently separated into two discs for the DVD release), the first part focuses on Reed and Bryant's involvement with political and labor disputes stateside and their fits-and-starts courtship, climaxing with their trip to Russia during the revolution. The second half shows them inspired by their experiences in Russia with Reed trying to lead the Communist party back in the U.S. but getting bogged down by bureaucracy in both countries. It all ends in an extravagant series of Zhivago-like sequences that crank up the romance quotient of the entire venture. Except for the occasional lapses into Hollywood formula, this is intelligent filmmaking if rather dense, and the politics become especially cumbersome in the second half with the actors resorting to speechifying.<br /><br />Beatty is as good as he's ever been as Reed, though his innately elliptical nature sometimes undermines the open idealism of the character he's portraying. With her self-effacing Annie Hall mannerisms held in check, Diane Keaton fulfills the comparatively more difficult role as the mercurial Bryant since she initially comes across as an embittered dilettante and then evolves in a somewhat disjointed manner to become the supportive wife. Both are so internally motivated as actors that they come across as a bit too contemporary and human-sized for such a romantic epic. Better is Jack Nicholson who threatens to steal the film as the cynically anguished O'Neill, especially in a hostile, painfully honest confrontation scene with Keaton. As Goldman, Maureen Stapleton transcends the dogma of her obsessive character with an undercurrent of humanity. Gene Hackman, Edward Herrmann, Paul Sorvino and writer Jerzy Kosinski are solid in smaller roles.<br /><br />Not too surprisingly, the technical aspects are impressive from Vittorio Storaro's cinematography, which ranges from the sepia tones of the early scenes to the bold colors used during the revolution montage, to Stephen Sondheim's original music score, which matches well with the period music used, to Richard Sylbert's production design. The 2006 DVD comes with just two extras - a trailer made for the DVD on the first disc, and an enlightening documentary in seven parts on the second disc, \\"Witness to Reds\\" by Laurent Bouzereau, which runs over an hour. Despite hisopen reservations about providing commentary on the film, Beatty is interviewed extensively, and other surviving key cast and crew members are included as well, including a surprisingly open Nicholson. Keaton unfortunately chose not to participate. Regardless, it's essential viewing if you want a greater context for the film from political history to actual production.g commentary on the film, Beatty is interviewed extensively, and other surviving key cast and crew members are included as well, including a surprisingly open Nicholson.

B00006AW2M|4.0|I think this is the better album since I hate the Beatles. You could claim that this was their response to Pepper, but then you'd have to admit that Pepper was the Beatles' response to the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, which is possibly the best record ever made. If you just listen to the record and don't worry about all that stuff, it's actually very good except for Sing all this together see what happens. I think We Love You and Dandelion should be on here too. I find this order works best: Sing all this together, Citadel, In another land, 2000 Man, (check out the cover by Kiss), Dandelion, See what happens, We Love You,Rainbow, Lantern, Gomper, Light years..., On with the show. This album, like Dirty Work, is nowhere near as bad as you've heard.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|After I borrowed this movie from my mom's house I dreaded putting it in. I thought it was going to be a long, drawn out & boring old-time flick about snobby people gossiping about each other. I was PLEASANTLY surprised. It caught my attention from beginning to end. The characters were SO likable. Yes, even the two-faced snobby rich sister, annoying mother & giddy younger sisters! They bugged me but made the movie that much more enjoyable. It was very nice how the script was able to portray the way of life back then. Although the Bennets lived in what we consider a huge house they were considered penniless. 5,000 pounds a year was considered rich. Trying to marry off your daughters to the wealthiest man possible was a goal a mother must bear (at least THIS one).<br /><br />I try to avoid watching Donald Sutherland movies as much as possible. He does so much better with villain roles than good-guy ones. Other than the failed attempt to an English accent, I really couldn't help liking his character in this movie very much. In fact, he was one of my favorites throughout the movie. Especially after he contradicted his wife when choosing sides w/Elizabeth in rejecting Mr. Collins' proposal of marriage.<br /><br />Personally, I don't think Knightley is the hottest fox out there but it fits her role of \\"nearly tolerable\\". Yeah, the lips have always bugged me but I looked past that because she's been great in all the roles I've seen her in. What I found most surprising was when Mr. Darcy first appeared, I had wished they'd picked a more handsome actor. His presentation of the role made him out to be SO irresistible and handsome. I loved the rain-scene the best. You were able to see his big blue eyes & he looked sexiest there.<br /><br />All in all, this was a very passionate & romantic movie. It was innocent enough to let young girls watch. Elizabeth Bennet was an intelligent character & a rather good role model for younger audiences. I put this movie up next to the Anne of Green Gables mini-series. Definitely not as wonderful but comparable in values & good storyline.ne of Green Gables mini-series.

B0009I7NNA|3.0|It's actually pretty good.  AS far as I'm concerned, the guitar work in this album redeems any other flaws, for the most part.  The two guitarists happen to be shred machines, who can outplay just about any other contemporary metal band I can think of, with just a few exceptions.  Their fluid, blistering sweep picking and neo-classical tinged soloing gives Yngwie Malmsteen a run for his money, and their dual-guitar harmonies are nothing short of Iron Maiden-esque.  The vocalist isn't all that bad, either.  I used to think these guys were a joke, but it seems that with this album, they've paid homage to classic metal by really dedicating time to their instruments, and putting a lot of thought and variety into the music.  They aren't terribly original, as their influences can be traced back to punk, hardcore, and ESPECIALLY metal.  I'd argue that they're a full-fledged metal band now, with the chops to prove it.   <br /> <br />Yes, the guys look ridiculous and dress like fools.  BUT so did most metal bands in their day.  These guys actually look less ridiculous than most 80's hair metal bands did when they were getting excessive radio play (Take a look at Def Leppard or Van Halen footage from the 80's).   <br /> <br />They have a good ear for melody and harmony, and can construct some very catchy songs.  Yes, it's true that they can be annoying, but I think that the guitar work and sense of melodic direction makes up for many of the flaws on the album.  It's still a little hokey when they break into a punk-rock tinged verse, or the lead singer hits one of his \\"rough patches\\" where he just sounds ridiculous.  However, it doesn't happen nearly as much as it used to, and I think that it might actually be possible to take this band seriously for once.  If nothing else, listen for the stellar guitar work. <br /> <br />3 stars, maybe 3 and a half.  Definitely not a bad effort.
B00005JPCD|4.0|Okay, the story line obviously doesn't hold in so many ways -- from the whole \\"I'll find out who's stealing the fish, and all will be well\\" bit, to the premise that birds who sing would necessarily have a problem with a bird who chooses to dance instead. The ending (alas) is all fairy tale, but nice enough. The musical twist is novel and comes off okay, even if a couple of the chosen tunes have lyrics that are a bit, ahem, dodgy for the under-five crowd.<br /><br />There are also a couple of places where the plot seems to have needed a random push to get over a hump, and some odd spots where things plain don't make a lot of sense. But hey, if we're okay with penguins singing Elvis tunes and speaking English with a Spanish accent, what can be \\"too weird\\"?<br /><br />This is not a Pixar movie where it all comes together; there isn't the same sense of perfect script, timing, and craftsmanship working harmoniously to tell a story and show off. But that all takes a backseat to the antics of some great characters, some excellent voice work (thank you, Robin Williams), some absolutely spectacular scenery (and incredible CGI) and enough thrills and spills for all.<br /><br />The kids I took to see the movie loved it and weren't particularly scared by the animals with many teeth, nor embarrassed by the mild sexual innuendo that seems to have so many people's knickers in a bunch (c'mon, people, it's all about loooove, as the movie's Lovelace -- aka Robin Williams -- would say). But with it's long, sweepy pans over the landscape and long-ish musical interludes, it may be hard keeping the attention of the antsiest little ones thru to the very end.

B00005JPCA|3.0|There were moments... I admit some jokes were very good (I thought Bond's comment on vodka/martini in the bar was hilarious) and practically every scene with Judy Dench was great.<br /><br />Madds Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre was not bad, though personally I think he had tonns of quiet menace as Tristan in King Arthur - where he looked much more dangerous than in this movie.<br /><br />Craig was slightly better than initially expected but he lacks charm, charisma, humour and wit that is traditionally linked with Bond's role. I remember watching the movie and having a funny thought that it was quite obvious why Lara Croft dropped her boyfriend (Craig played Lara's former boyfriend in the first Croft movie - and she had to save the looser at the end).<br /><br />I hated the absence of logic in actions and characters. The best example is the first chase where Bond shouts to his associate not to shoot the guy running away as he needs him alive. He them proceeds to chase him all over the place, creates a major diplomatic incident and then shoots the guy himself. If he needed to pick up some items from the dead man (as it is shown) it would have been considerably more logical to shoot him in the very beginning and same himself some heavy running.<br /><br />Same with characters. The best way for the girl in the movie would have been to tell Bond everything and get his cooperation. But that would have been out of the type for a femme fatale (who does not have much use for brains, obviously).<br /><br />What I definitely did not like was all the teary-bleary love story that clogged the plot so much that at moments all action stopped to permit another soul-wrenching conversation with Eva Green's heroine. Being a woman myself, I suppose I should have loved the soppy interludes but they were way too pathetic. When the heroine looks tragic all the time in all circumstances, it is really difficult to feel anything for her when the tragedy finally happens.<br /><br />In fact all the sentimentality and wooden acting is the reason I give the movie no more than 3 stars. Have been watching Bond movies for years and I simply do not feel like a \\"New Age\\" sensitive Bond with a broken heart or a Bond without humor and charisma.<br /><br />I shudder at the thought that I now have to wait 10 (20?) years for Craig to be replaced with somebody more \\"bondish\\". What a pity.entimentality and wooden acting is the reason I give the movie no more than 3 stars.

0375751513|1.0|I was really looking forward to this book, since I heard glowing reviews about it. However, I found it to be perhaps the most excruciating reading experience of my life thus far (with the exception of mathematics texts), and I wish I could've given it 0 stars. I don't mind it when authors digress a bit from the story to reflect on a theme or two, but Wilde did it so often it seemed like I was reading a 100+ page philosophy essay on art. I think Wilde is a fantastic writer with an almost perfect sense of wit, and I think he had a good story, but something went wrong when he was writing the manuscript and he ended up making this novel a university lecture for his beliefs.
B000002ITK|4.0|I have been a huge Twisted fan for over 25 years.  I watched them evolve from their small club dates in upstate New York to their immense popularity in the mid eighties.  I sadly watched as internal turmoil tore this band apart in the late eighties, was pleasantly surprised by their collaboration for \\"Heroes Are Hards To Find\\" from Dee's Strangeland movie and impressed by their reunion after 9/11.  It was like they never left.  However, for those of you who disapprove of this recording, please see that the cover does not say \\"Greatest Hits\\".  Twisted was not about \\"greatest hits\\".  They were about great music.  Sure, they could have included great cuts like \\"Come Out And Play\\" or \\"Wake Up (the Sleeping Giant\\" (which may be, admittedly, one of their best tracks).  However, they included several \\"live\\" tracks which is what makes them special.  If you have never seen a \\"live\\" show, catch them before it is too late.  They are the rare band who are amazing \\"live\\".  Studio recordings do not do them justice.  Okay, so not all of their best songs are included here.  If you want all their great music, suck it up and buy their other CD's.  You won't regret it.  But, what IS here is what they were all about...  great band and great music.  Live on SMF's...

B000IU3XTW|5.0|I'm not sure if the cd and dvd will do this performance justice if you didn't get a chance to see this tour. They opened with Razor, which I am not a huge fan of on the studio album.  But by the end of that song my jaw was on the floor.  And it stayed there pretty much the whole night.  When I listen to this album it takes me right back there, so it is on heavy rotation in my cd player and ipod right now. <br /> <br />As some people have mentioned, this disc does not have the complete set that they were generally performing on their tour.  I guess that is a bit unfortunate for those of us that always want more from them, but the Foos just did release a double album so that might have been a constraint.  When I think about some of the songs left off, I am not heartbroken over the tracks that didn't make it.  And as for other Foo songs that would have sounded great if they did acoustic versions...well, I don't know a single live album that doesn't draw that sort of speculation. <br /> <br />I'm really glad they decided to release this live album, because we will hopefully be seeing the Foos rock for years but something like this tour could be a one time thing. I must be getting old, because the fact that I can put this cd in and listen to it and have my whole family enjoy it is also very nice.

B000GTLQXU|1.0|Considering the director's track-record, the high quality of the original movie (The Poseidon Adventure) and the budget available for making this remake, I found Poseidon to be an absolutely awful and uninteresting movie and a complete waste of time and money. I give it 1 star because I cannot go any lower than that. I read the reviews before watching it, so I was prepared for the worst, but it was even worse than I expected. Let's keep in mind we're talking about a film that is supposed to be a blockbuster movie here, not a mere TV-film. The only positive thing I have to say about it, is that it is mercifully short. While watching it on DVD, I barely overcame the urge to fast-forward certain scenes. The plot has holes so big an oceanliner the size of Titanic could sail through them and still have room to maneuver. There is no introduction, no explanation whatsoever as to where the ship is going, who the people are, what caused the monster-wave, etc. Calling the main characters two- instead of three-dimensional is giving them too much credit. You don't care at all whether they survive or die, the only exception perhaps being the little boy. The CGI effects aren't all that great either. I never knew so much things could explode on a partially submerged ocean-liner (a typical and, to me, illogical and extremely irritating Hollywood trademark). The movie really is no more than a boring and repetitious series of clims and crawls through poorly lit and generally burning areas. The water is supposed to be cold and salt, but that doesn't show, even for a second. Although they are just (first-time) passengers, the people involved know their way around the vessel remarkably well (even though it is turned upside down)and have an uncanny knowledge about its inner workings and where to go for escape. They know exactly which hatch or stairwell to take and which button to push, even scared and exhausted in the dark and underwater. Ever been inside a large ship or ferry boat yourself ? You don't know which end is which or where to go if your life depends on it. At the end of the movie, the survivors reach daylight and: lo and behold: there's just one piece of wreckage afloat and it is an inflated life-raft, conveniently located near the bow-thrusters. In typical Hollywood tradition, the ship sinks bare seconds after the survivors have climbed inside the raft. Mr Petersen's Poseidon project should have sunk well before he got started. A seriously uncool movie that is insulting even to people who are looking for 1,5 hours of brainless entertainment. <br />

B00005JMEW|2.0|Kill Bill is the most distasteful movie Quentin Tarantino has ever done. From the unnecessary gore to the artless battle scenes that directly copied Japanese Manga, Mr. Tarantino has really categorized himself as one of the worst fall-from-grace directors of all time. Pulp Fiction was a cult classic, there is no doubt about it, even the Oscars recognized Quentin's talent, but Kill Bill probably stinks more than a jockstrap filled with onions. Despite its great reviews from blood sucking critics, I thought it was a horrible movie. It was bloody. It was boring. It was corny. And if the high-wattage name of Quentin Tarantino was to make this flick an artistic masterpiece, it failed.     First there is the title card with the quote \\"Revenge is a dish best served cold,\\" followed by the attribution \\"old Klingon proverb.\\" Which sometimes does lead the audience to think that the story will dig deeper and include rounded characterization as well as splendid film plot, but it doesn't. Taratino's new film does not portray revenge as a deep and powerful emotion, but rather as just a thing you should do when someone wrongs you. All the characters will remain flat, as Taratino's new film is just an \\"Itchy and Scratchy\\" story played by famous actresses. Hate and revenge are the only themes involved in the storyline and neither is portrayed with great depth.     In the first scene, the story (as in most Tarantino movies) starts at the end. The viewer is immediately placed into the action as we witness a pregnant bride (Uma Thurman) bloody, surrounded by the corpses of her wedding party, and pleading for her life before she is shot in the head. The voice of a faceless man is introduced, and is the one that shoots Uma in the head. But anyone who has seen the previews knows who Bill (David Carradine) is, and remembers the voice that used to fill the old Kung Fu series, so the element of surprise is never there when we are introduced to Bill's true identity later on. Of course, as withany cliché, the hero doesn't die -- and four years later she is out for revenge.     It is also interesting to note that Taratino's new film is viewed in chapters instead of a stream of connection plots. I don't know if this is because Taratino is paying tribute to the Kill Bill Manga (Japanese cartoon) series, but it seems like just another bad attempt at being original. I should also note that perhaps Taratino is using this particular format to \\"cut to the chase\\" better than most other action movies. But who really cares.    Back to the story, the main character's (Uma Thurman) only goal in the movie is introduced early. Well actually, it is introduced in the title - Kill Bill. But first, she has to find Bill. The viewer is introduced to Bill's little gang of assassins. The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad consists of five most deadly killers, led by Bill. There is O'Ren-Ishii as Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu), Elle Driver as California Mountain Snake, Vernita Green as Copperhead (Vivica A Fox), Budd as Sidewinder. And there is The Bride (Uma Thurman), whose name is not spoken.    Uma Thurman battles out with a Copperhead aka Vivica A Fox. The audience is introduced to her in a surreal sequence of events that will set the tone for the rest of the film. Although Vivica's character does include a certain depth, Vivica's love for her daughter does not ever come to the surface, and even when it does, her lines are filled with sarcasm that leads the crowd to laugh rather than to understand her position. I think it is interesting to note that Uma did not kill Copperhead's daughter while Copperhead had no problem killing Uma's daughter, It's also interesting to note that Uma Thurman's character had a baby, and \\"lost\\" it and Copperhead has a daughter and she is four. Which could lead the viewer to think that maybe Copperhead took care of Uma's daughter this whole time and the second film is going to include a more in depth conflict between mother and daughter. Because the daughter thinks Copperhead is her real mother and did see Uma kill her \\"mother.\\"    Uma kills Copperhead and is set out to go to Japan to battle ex-Viper O-Ren (Lucy Liu) and her army of yakuza in a Tokyo dancehall. Asian movie references abound. Taratino honors Sonny Chiba (the very famous Japanese actor) by giving the Japanese movie hero a very substantial role in which he describing O-Ren's violent origins, in Japanese animé. I personally thought that the anime version should have been cut but realized that no moviegoer would have liked to see a child actor commit so much bloody homicide. (Especially a girl) Tarantino also honors Bruce Lee by employing \\"The Green Hornet\\" theme and putting O-Ren's yakuza in Kato-like masks and the final battle scene with Bruce Lee's yellow striped costume. And when The Bride flies into Tokyo, it's not a real Tokyo -- it's a model Tokyo that looks only minutes away from a Godzilla visitation.     The copious violence, climaxing in fire hoses of blood gushing from arms and legs in the dancehall fight, is so removed from reality -- and, in a sop to the MPAA, partly shown in black-and-white -- that they turn comical. Some scenes, chiefly a gratuitously nasty bit involving a hospital orderly who pimps The Bride's still-comatose body, are not so easily dismissed as cinematic excess.     Thurman gives a spectacular \\"physical\\" performance; slashing and dicing probably took hours of choreography and hundreds of hours of practice. Uma's throws her 5-foot-11 self into the demanding fight scenes opposite Liu. But there's not much to say for Thurman's mental performance. She's angry, she fights, she kills, end of story.     In my opinion, some of the highest points of the movie where during the scenes with Japanese legend Sonny Chiba, filled with humor and beauty. It also incorporates a western style of hatred and aggression into an eastern style of seeing fighting as art rather than ruthless violence. Sonny's swords are a sight to see. Another good scene was the final scene with Lucy Liu, as Uma steps out of the tumulus restaurant only to find a peaceful and beautiful snowy setting. Of course then there's more fighting and blood and senseless violence. But oh well.
B00000I07P|4.0|I liked this album till the end. In the end I started to cry after hearing songs like NEVER SAY GOODBYE. The First 4 are all great HEADBANGERS!! Somehow I kinda start to think that all these slow power ballads make me sad..the only ballad I have ever loved in my whole life was ''Waiting For A Girl Like You'' by Foreigner which I found that song sweet and lovely, and wonderful and I think it is the greatest song in the world.

0300108834|5.0|A well written and engaging read, but the focus is narrower than the title would suggest.  My 9-year-old loved having this book read to him.  Be aware that the focus is very much on Western civilization, and, presumably due to the author's background, there is a disproportinate focus on the Germanic peoples.  The author makes sidelong glances at China, India and the Americas, but you will have to look elsewhere for a history of these regions.   <br /> <br />With that in mind, I can recommend the book to parents who like to read to their 4th-5th graders, or to good readers at these grade levels.
B00005JPCA|5.0|I was quite surprised how good this series reboot was. Daniel Craig has convinced me that the 40+ year old franchise will be in good hands for years to come. While I don't believe that there has ever  been a bad actor to portray Ian Flemings creation I feel that each one has brought a different dimension to the role geared towards his strengths. But let's be honest, Connery is still the best because he has that right balance of charm and wit that'll make you smile one moment and then beat you to a bloody pulp the next. But overall I like Craig because he approaches the character closer to the Fleming books and that's not a bad thing although that may turn some people off. <br />        What I really love about this movie is the way we get to see how James Bond becomes \\"James Bond\\" and I think its quite refreshing and fun. I also think Vesper Lynn is quite possibly the most fully realized and best developed Bond girl since Tracy Draco in \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\\" It's also nice to see a more realistic villian in LeChiffre for a change instead of the take over the world types we ushally see. I also think the ending is one of the best ever in the series.Director Martin Cambell does a fine job and it's no coincidence he also directed the best Pierce Brosnan Bond in \\"Goldeneye\\". <br />         The only gripe I have with Casino Royale is the Title song by Chris Cornell . It's probably the weakest in the series. But overall this is a great Bond film and I think I may see it at the theater again.

It also reaches everyone on different levels and gives them something to talk about around the dinner table. <br /> <br />Bottom line...it's just awesome to have this show FINALLY out on dvd, even without all the terrific music that was used originally.
B00005KB9X|4.0|Okay, there are several good songs on Natty Dread. I love Lively Up Yourself, plus Dem Belly Full; Rebel Music; So Jah Seh; Talkin' Blues and Revolution are good too. You'll notice I don't include No Woman, No Cry. I'm sorry, but this doesn't have HALF the sincerity of the live version, which is certainly definitive. This seems almost forced, whereas the live version is a reggae anthem. The title track strikes me as silly and childish, plus I don't see how Bend Down Low made on this album. If you're new to Bob, you're better off with Catch a Fire, Burnin' or Exodus (not to mention Legend). But once you're into him, this isn't a bad buy at all.
B000IU3Y1O|5.0|This is a great collection of songs from Depeche Mode.  Is it really the \\"Best Of\\"?  That is up to debate, because every DM fan has a different idea of what their best songs are (I feel \\"Stripped\\" & \\"Freelove\\" shouldn't have been omitted).  At least with the Singles collection, there was no debate; they were officially released singles.  Regardless of what hierarchy these tunes fall in the DM catalog, they are still great.<br /><br />As for the new track Martyr, it is a great song.  Wonderful synthesizers, guitar and vocals, overall a classic Depeche Mode track.  Recorded during the Playing the Angel sessions, the band felt that this song didn't fit the \\"dark\\" mood of PTA, so it was left off the album.  However, it has found it's home on this Best Of compilation.<br /><br />As for the second disc, it is a DVD with all the videos featured on the CD (the first disc).  Sadly, many of these videos are featured on the Singles 86-98 DVD set.  Therefore, many people will be paying twice for videos they already have. I am sure many fans who are buying this Best Of set, already have the Singles 86-98 DVD set, which where most of these videos have already been featured.  However, videos like \\"Dream On\\" & \\"Suffer Well\\" make it worth the investment for this new set.<br /><br />Depeche Mode is an amazing band and deserve recognition for all the work and contributions they have made to the music industry.  This collection is also a very fan centered release, and Depeche Mode has always been appreciated of their fans.  Which makes them a real class act.  I'm already looking forward to Best Of Volume 2.
B00005LANG|5.0|You'll need this album, along with Burnin' it's Bob Marley's best. So Much Things to Say is a throwaway. The rest? Natural Mystic; the Heathen and Guiltiness are all good. But everything from the militant-yet-danceable title track on is pure gold. As I have mentioned, I love the title song; Jammin' is a classic, and possibly my favorite Bob Marley song; though Waiting in Vain, the perfect love song, gives it a run for its money. You don't hear much about the sexy slow jam Turn Your Down Lights Low, a damn shame since it alone is worth the price of the disc even if you have a greatest hits. And if you can resist smiling after hearing Three Little Birds and One Love/People Get Ready, you're obviously jaded, cynical and have lost all faith in humanity (I'm not QUITE there yet). It's too bad they didn't include Punky Reggae Party on the normal album, instead sticking it on as a bonus track, since it's arguably better than any songs  on the normal album - no mean feat, let me add! Make sure to buy this ASAP.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This has got to be one of the Best Concerts in history.  We had it on VHS, but the DVD is incredible!
B000002A3T|5.0|I bought this album when i was a kid, it was my first cd ever. I saw the video for \\"take it back\\" on tv, and i've never heard anything like it. The music wasn't light modern pop, it was well orchestrated and envisioned, but it's delivery felt light and coherent, free of often stifling self-importance and limiting stylistic elitism of classical rock. <br /> <br />Then after a few months i saw the video for division bell, which once more was unlike anything i heard, coherently melodic and listenable yet rich and evocative at it's core. Realising the same band was responsible for both songs i was determined to buy the cd. <br /> <br />At the time i didn't know anything about Pink Floyd, their history or significance, their age. What i knew is that i had an album that felt electronic, pop, classical rock, but wasn't any of those things or an amalgamation of each, yet instead hovered above genres and utilised, like an instrument, whatever felt right. <br />Now some ten years later, this remains one of the rare albums i keep coming back to, understanding that defying their age Pink Floyd have at the time managed to make an album both inspired and experimenting, defying easy categorisation but maintaining coherency, with unusualy meaningful lyrics that i can virtually see david gilmour penning while laying on the floor, with a sense of liberating disregard for his age.
B00005M91K|4.0|Baraka is a movie that takes you on a trip around the world in somewhat of a dream-like state. I have had this \\"movie\\" for many years now. You have to be in a certain kind of mood to watch and enjoy this DVD. If you enjoy humanity and nature films you will most likely enjoy this DVD as much as I do. Well worth the money for a journey around the world and a peek into other cultures and just pure nature!
B0007LXPBI|5.0|This movie is a pure classics, what else can I say? Perfect cast, great play, timeless story. I've been watching this movie with my daughter for countless times and it still touches the best feelings.<br /><br />It's a remake but if you were to choose between the old and the new movies - this one is the better choice.
B00005JPCA|5.0|I liked this film and it is nice that, like Batman Returns, the producers are taking the character in a whole new direction and breathing life into the franchise.  For once it was nice to see someone who can actually fight commando style fill the role. <br /> <br />We finally see how Bond became Bond and the movie tells how Bond first me Felix Leiter.  This Bond is more ruthless than his predecessors, without the smugness of Moore or Brosnon.  Additionally, this Bond seems to bear his emotions, something we have never seen before and he seems to treat women on a more equal level.  I see this Bond as a lot closer to the Jason Bourne character played by Matt Damon then to any of the previous Bonds. <br /> <br />Though I liked the Brosnon portrayals, his movies were predictable and difficult to differentiate between any of the prior movies.   This movie is fresh and makes you want to see this version of Bond in re-inventing some of the earlier Bond films in a fresh light too! <br />
0671027344|5.0|I read this book in a single night and as i was reading it, i was both shocked and amazed at how well the author described the life of a high school teenager (which i am.) The part that amazed me the most was i found myself thinking \\"this author gets it!\\" for unlike most adults, he wasn't writting from the adult point of view... He was writing through the eyes of a teenager and mastered it brillantly!  I dont recomend this book as \\"a parents guide to what might be going on in YOUR childs life\\" but for a teenager as a \\"your not alone in highschool\\" I hope you enjoy the book as much as i did!  <br /> <br />
0316066524|5.0|There's no way to sum up my thoughts or feelings about this book in a capsule review, nor would I bother to make the attempt, but I feel a need to respond to the countless readers below who portray this book as pretentious or clinical or \\"clever for its own sake.\\"  They've totally missed the point.  When I first sat down with IJ, I was apprehensive, suspecting the novel would be an interminable post-modern wack-off a la AMERICAN PSYCHO, where endless reams of detail act as a substitute for deeper insight into the human condition.  What I found was the exact opposite-- chapter after chapter, Wallace put words to the thoughts and feelings I had never commited to paper, for fear of embarrassment or reprisal.  In an age of irony and sarcasm, IJ is a truly sincere, truly humane work of art, and if this book doesn't move you or touch you than you've missed out on something spectacular.  Despite its epic length and (purported) difficulty, Infinite Jest is not obtuse or elliptical or hard to understand-- it is an examination of the human soul, and for that reason, it is utterly relatable.  Dive in.
0618680004|5.0|I read this book over the weekend and I've read most of the reviews here (yes, all 206 of them) and a lot of the comments.  I'm not sure I have much to add, but here goes. <br /> <br />As a book, I have no doubt that everyone should read it, whether for confirmation of your beliefs, to know thine enemy, or in a spirit of honest enquiry.  The book is well-written, funny, and up-to-date.  Certainly, it is arresting.  Who could not be drawn in by a chapter that starts: \\"The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindinctive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully\\", if only to knock down such an over-the-top description? <br /> <br />Indeed, the book is a polemic, though I am not convinced that the sentence above will persuade anyone.  The book is well-argued, and includes, in the middle third of the book, some facts and theory that were new to me, if a little turgid.  IOW, if you buy this book you will learn something, and be admirably entertained to boot. <br /> <br />I won't go into the arguments he makes here.  I will say that a large number of the 1-star reviewers appear not to have read the book, believe that quoting scripture is an argument, that the \\"tone\\" of sentences such as the one I quoted above somehow invalidates his arguments, or that a rational assertion, such as 1+1=2 or \\"I am 1m77 tall\\", is somehow a matter of faith, as much as their faith is.  If that last is true, we can have no rational argument because you do not even believe in the _concept_. <br /> <br />I will, however, point to some \\"consciousness-raising\\" that he does, because it deserves repeating even if you don't buy the book.  He points out that atheists today are in much the same position as gays were 50 years ago.  If you were gay, you simply didn't say anything.  He wants atheists to come of the closet.  Second, he points out that the phrase \\"a christian child\\" should make us wince, much as a racist or sexist comment does today.  He would prefer to say \\"a child of christian parents\\", since the child cannot have informed consent.  (He further argues that having an adult impose religion on a child in the absence of informed consent is similar to an adult enticing a child into a sexual relationship without informed consent, and so constitutes abuse.  Strong stuff.) <br /> <br />Finally, perhaps the most effective passage of the book for me is where he describes a professor who was proved wrong in a matter of science after 15 years of arguing the opposite.  The professor thanked the speaker.  This moved me.  But what followed moved me more.  A respected scientist found conflict in what his science told him and what his bible told him.  He went through his bible cutting out all the sentences that his rationality told him were false.  He was left with a bible in tatters.  So he gave up science. <br /> <br />Some of you may find this telling anecdote heartening, that the scientist's faith stood up to his reason.  Personally, I find it devastating.  Not the loss of a \\"soul,\\" but the loss of a great mind.  How repugnant.   <br /> <br />By that anecdote alone, Dawkins certainly convinced me.
B000ICM5VW|5.0|Wow the reviews so far doesnt seem to do this movie justice, it was a box office hit. Either way I didnt want to point out whether or not I like the movies storyline, there are plenty of dvd reviews for that.<br /><br />But I do want to leave my recommendations for this as an HD DVD. This is by far one of the best looking HD DVDs available so far. This goes way beyond the picture quality of the DVD version. The images are brilliant and jump off the screen at you.<br /><br />It is amazing that a movie over 3 hours long with a picture resolution of twice that of a regular dvd now fits on a single disk.<br /><br />If you have an HD DVD player and want to be impressed with its picture quality this one is a must have for your collection.
B00008CLOA|5.0|This edition has fantastic sound quality. If you have to ask about the music itself, well, then, please get a copy as soon as possible, so you'll be privy to this classic.
B000JLTR8G|5.0|The Yakuza is one of the great films of the seventies. Although this didn't make much noise in the seventies (despite a truly surreal promotional gimmick, `Join the Yakuza Set' tattoo transfers!), it has held up a lot better than he plethora of seventies thrillers that swamped it at the time.    Belonging to that subgenre of Americans-in-Japan thrillers (Fuller's House of Bamboo, Scott's Black Rain, Frankenheimer's The Challenge), The Yakuza is a film about the price of honor and about people who face their responsibilities. The film could almost be called `giri' - Japanese for obligation or the burden hardest to bear. Richard Jordan's bodyguard may start out wiseguy (\\"That can work both ways. If you ain't alive tomorrow, he don't owe you s***.\\") but even he lives up to his moral obligations when discharged from them by Mitchum. All of the plot developments are a result of obligations, with the characters following through as per their personal codes of honor, taken to the ultimate extreme in Mitchum's final apology to Takakura Ken for destroying both his past and his future.    The hook might be that Mitchum returns to Japan to help secure the release of an old army friend's daughter from a Yakuza clan and in the process reopening old wounds with former lover Kishi Keiko and her brother Takakura Ken, but the emotional undercurrents are as important as the plot developments, with the film's criminal double-dealing mirrored in the myriad personal betrayals he is as he is forced to face the fact that he has always confused his friends with his enemies.    It is not a film that wears its emotions on its sleeve, and is all the more affecting for that the awkwardness of Mitchum's meeting with Ken and the hesitancy of his reunion with Keiko (and the subtle re-enactment of the old photos in her album) - everything is in the pauses and between the lines. It's these emotional undercurrents that make it stand up to repeated viewings.    The early seventies was a last golden age for the eternally under-rated Mitchum, with outstanding performances in The Friends of Eddie Coyle, Farewell My Lovely and Ryan's Daughter, and this is one of his best. His `strange stranger' and Takakura Ken's `man who never smiles' (\\"He's been unhappy ever since he lost the war. I keep trying to tell him it's not his fault but he won't take my word for it\\") is a match made in casting heaven. Their screen presence is remarkably similar, exuding a lifetime of world-weariness and personal loss that attracts both empathy and respect for their characters. Both give superbly understated performances, with the great Takakura Ken getting his best English-language role to date.    Jordan gives a nicely unassuming performance in the juvenile lead, making the most of his romantic subplot by showing the least, and there's an added poignancy to his fate since the actor's death. Indeed, all the performances are superb, with the emphasis on being rather than acting.    The screenplay as filmed is a terrific mixture of the commercial and the cerebral. Where most modern American thrillers are driven by indiscriminate violence (\\"In America, a guy cracks up he opens a window and kills a few strangers. Here, a guy cracks up, he closes the window and kills himself,\\" observes Jordan), here events and participants are interconnected. All of the main characters are friends or surrogate family, and although Robert Towne was brought in to up the gangster element from the Shraders' (Leonard and Paul) more philosophical approach (the differences can be found in Leonard Schrader's novelization), he knows enough to keep it personal. It's witty too, without being condescending or resorting to the pre-kill one-liners so prevalent today that divorce the audience from the consequences and ramifications of violence. Only a very dialog-heavy bit of exposition about the backstory between Mitchum and Keiko feels a tad clumsy.    Sydney Pollack's sensitivity to the material is remarkable. There's anunshowy adventurousness to his direction that he hasn't displayed since. In particular, the action scenes are extraordinary without ever straying from the credible, a disciplined mixture of stillness and sudden violence and a complete departure in style for the director.    Warners' new DVD is long overdue, and very welcome indeed. Extras are a little thin - a very good 19-minute promotional featurette from 1974, Promises to Keep, and an audio commentary from Sydney Pollack - and it's disappointing that the deleted scenes from the longer 123-minute version of the film are not included.
B00005JM1F|4.0|If you're looking for laughs without being challenged, this is a great way to spend a couple of hours. It's not ground breaking, it's just funny. Watch Meet the Press to rev your brain back up after this one.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|There are so many weird artists now days who try to make money off of Christmas, yet their songs have little to do with the holydays itself, which is sad, because obveously they do not respect Jesus, or His birth, they just wanna make money!!! Now, Sarah kept the respect to the holiday, remembering that it is indeed the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, yet she gave it her own style!!! I'm very happy with her CD! It's very beautiful!
0471267554|5.0|I was recommeded this book by a fitness coach.  I was about 50 lbs overweight and suffering health problems.  Anyhow, I been following the program for about 2 months now and occasionally work out and have lost 25 lbs.  I tried Atkins before and did lose about 40 lbs, but as soon as I went off and added carbs back I gained weight like no tomorow.  I wore everything I ate.  With this program I eat a lot of fruit and vegtables and the part that is great is it seems to kill your hunger after awhile.  I used to think about food most of the time and with this program, I actually sometimes have to remind myself to eat.  That is completely un-heard of for me prior.  Additionally, I feel much better, my compexion, and skin is much healthier looking.  I ve lost about 25 lbs already and I have  energy to want to work out.  With Atkins I had no energy and no endurance.  Occasionaly when I cheat, and eat bread, it actually upsets my stomach now.   I used to have indigestion frequently, now that is also gone.  I highly recommend this program.
B000IFQLLY|4.0|Music: 5 Stars; Compilation: 3 Stars<br /><br />Depeche Mode's first album was released 1981, and the band celebrated their 25 years in the music business this year by touring extensively behind last year's \\"Playing the Angel\\" album, their 11th studio album. Depeche Mode has issued many, many hit singles over the years which has been compiled in the \\"Singles 81>85\\" and \\"Singles 86>98\\" compilations. Now comes the very first career-spanning \\"best of\\".<br /><br />\\"The Best of Depeche Mode, Volume 1\\" (18 tracks; 74 min.) tries to capture the essence of the band, and indeed a lot of great music is on here: \\"Personal Jesus\\", \\"Emjoy the Silence\\", \\"People Are People\\" and many other hits are on here. There are 3 songs from the most recent 2 albums (\\"Dream On\\", \\"Suffer Well\\" and \\"Precious\\") and one new song, an okay \\"Martyr\\" (from the \\"Playing the Angel\\" sessions.) Two issues: (1) the music suffers from not being sequenced chronologically: from \\"See You\\" straight into \\"It's No Good\\"? Not good!; (2) There are a LOT of equally essential hits that are missing. Just to name a few: \\"Policy of Truth\\", \\"Barrell of a Gun\\", \\"World In My Eyes\\", \\"Leave in Silence\\", \\"Get the Balance Right\\", \\"It's Called a Heart\\" and on and on...<br /><br />The question then is who this compilations is intended for. Surely the more devoted DM fans will not be very interested in this (just buy \\"Martyr\\" as a single or as a download). So it's for the casual Depeche Mode fan, who just wants to have the best-known songs in one place. This assumes there are many casual DM fans... As mentioned already, there are a lot of hits missing, but teasingly this compilation is subtitled \\"Volume 1\\" so at some point this will be corrected (presumably with the inclusion again of one new track).
B000IHY146|5.0|Karen Dalton's second and final album, \\"In My Own Time,\\" has finally been released on November 7th, 2006--35 years after it was cut on vinyl.  Once you listen to it, you'll understand why this is an outrage.<br /><br />Simply put, Dalton has one of the most complex, emotive voices I've ever heard.  It's something about the way it comes out of her--the listener can hear at least three different timbres in Dalton's voice: from the whispered, muffled breath that gives the singer her inimitable languid time, to the aching, trebly brunt of her sound to a more hidden harmonic resonance that lingers behind every word, Dalton has one of the most unique styles I've ever had the pleasure of listening to.<br /><br />The song choice is excellent--her unique way of singing, timing and phrasing completely transforms familiar tunes like \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\" and Richard Manuel's \\"[[ASIN:B00004W50T In A Station]],\\" and \\"How Sweet it Is\\" giving them entirely new meanings and making them Dalton's own.  Every song is completely enchanting, and even though the chord structures and instrumentation are familiar, Dalton takes the music to a completely different place.<br /><br />The backing instrumentation is great--Dylan's early bassist is along for the ride, the electric guitar is fluid, lively and interesting in its own right, and Dalton's banjo brings some cuts a dark, country feel, adding to the album's stylistic diversity.<br /><br />This album is recommended for fans of folk, blues and jazz (yes, Dalton has been compared to Holliday, but she's in a register all her own), and anyone who appreciates a unique voice.  Sure, it's laid back music, but if you let yourself get into the words and emotions, there's energy there that even the loudest music can't equal.  Once you're hooked on Dalton's voice, check out her lesser classic, [[ASIN:B000001SM7 It's So Hard To Tell Who's Going To Love You The Best]].
B000784WMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, it starts off kinda slow, but is very true to the book.  I loved the passion from Tim Dalton, he was very dedicated to his role. I highly recommend this movie.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|The set is great, make no mistake about that.  Great packaging, great TV drama.  But I am annoyed with Amazon, as I bought it 2 weeks ago when the price was $197.99 and now it has dropped almost $20 in 2 weeks.  Not Fair!!
B000IFQLLY|5.0|This is a must-have.  I'm looking very forward to Volume 2.
B000001FS3|4.0|The beatles had their White album, Metallica had their black album and U2 had Joshua Tree. This was the album that transformed U2 into the mainstream from being an underground protest rock band into a large stadium rock band. They also released a movie Rattle and Hum a year after its release and showed footage of the recording sessions of this album which was pretty interesting. Overall This was the last great studio album they'll do after that they start following trends instead of leading them like their next album Achtung Baby has some good songs like one and a few others but it was too radio friendly and bland but after that album they released unlistenable albums like Zooropa and pop.
1592289444|5.0|Reviewed by Beverly Pechin for Reader Views (10/06)<br /><br />From the very beginning of \\"The Long Walk,\\" the reader will know immediately that the author is no ordinary person. After reading the book, you will truly understand the abilities of the human soul to overtake the human body and survive, literally.<br /><br />The true saga of a man who is imprisoned in Russian work camps, the author takes you from the beginnings of his capture. His writing style, including the translation process, seems to give you an even more authentic appreciation of the trials and tribulations he and the many others he was with went through. You will see determination, human pride and utter miracles as they unfold throughout the story, touching you so deeply within, that you will never be able to simply walk away from this story. You will carry a piece of it deep within your heart and soul and be able to pull it out whenever you need to be reminded of the human spirit.<br /><br />As a former Polish soldier, he was taken prisoner under false pretense. Accused of being a spy against the Russians he was given a trial, basically as a front to say he was justly accused and tried for his wrong doings. Having no truth to the matter, they found most all men in his situation, former Polish military men, guilty and quickly condemned them to work camps.<br /><br />One of the most touching moments of the book was when the men, all gathered tightly in a train car, realized that it was Christmas Eve. Keeping the true spirit of Christmas in their hearts, they banded together and sang to celebrate the birth of Jesus together, ending with most men in tears as they remembered the families they left behind. Those that made the trek through the first part quickly came to realize that survival was going to be something that they had to do themselves, as their capturers were not going to be of any help in keeping them alive.<br /><br />Marching by gunpoint across the cold Russian terrains, they fought freezing temperatures, horrible weather conditions, plagues, lack of food and much more as they were forced to continue on their route to their literal death camp. Eventually, trekking across many miles after a heroic escape from their camp in Yakutsk the author shares every minute of their life with the reader. While some of it can be almost unbearable to read, you simply cannot turn away as you know you have to see what happens to these brave men who escape their assured fate of death.<br /><br />As they come across many people who are so kind and generous, they realize that perhaps not the whole world is cold and evil as they have come to expect. Meeting village after village as they walk carrying what little they have to their name, including their own few articles of clothing that sparsely covers them, they literally walk out of Siberia and through China, Tibet, The Gobi Desert, across the Himalayas, over ice covered waterways and finally into British India. As they watch their friends and colleagues die in front of their eyes, combat such amazing conditions that no human being should ever be able to overcome, they begin to realize that perhaps freedom will be theirs.<br /><br />Touching, amazing and literally breath holding moments will make you want to share this story with others simply to share your sudden awareness of mankind's ability to overcome the impossible. The touching moment when he and his fellow survivors say goodbye from their final ending place, an Indian hospital, you can feel the pain and loneliness in the author's heart. Written with an amazingly poignant touch that will make you not only sympathize but truly feel the pain of all those involved. As you read the special \\"Afterword,\\" added to the 1997 edition of the book, you will realize that this man is truly someone you would want to use as a role model. \\"The Long Walk\\" shows readers a man of men, a man of courage and a man of heart. Not only will you celebrate his ending, you will cry with him as he realizes he truly is alive with life.<br /><br />Book received free of chargeeceived free of charge
B000I5X80G|5.0|I'm not the biggest Neil Young fan but I do like alot of his electric music as opposed to his acoustic stuff. Since I don't have alot of N.Y. music in my collection, I bought this and I'm very happy with it. Recommended to those who are like me in this regard.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already? Final Fantasy 7 is a gorgeous work of art. The voice acting (which wasn't implemented into the game, unfortuantly) was superb. Tifa sounded a little off, the voice didn't match the body, but it was good none-the-less. <br /> <br />The CG graphics were awesome and absolutley flawless.  <br /> <br />This is the single best animated movie, ever.

B000HEWEE4|5.0|My wife and I both loved this sweet film. Sure, there are a few holes in the script from a sci-fi POV but if you suspend belief for 2 hours, you'll enjoy this love story, especially if you can share it with someone you love. And isn't that the point of most movies? That is, we suspend belief in the \\"normal\\", every day rules of logic, and plunge headfirst into the world of make-believe.<br /><br />Bullock and Reeves (I guess you have to be named \\"Reeves\\" to make a film about time-travel love!) have a wonderful chemistry together: they make you believe in the magic of romance. And even though almost everyone will figure out the plot well before the movie's end, there is still one moment that could go either way, which makes it worthwhile.<br /><br />Really, folks - sit back and enjoy this one. Much more worthwhile than brainless, inane flicks like anything starring Jack Black or any of the myriad \\"teen\\" comedies.

B000002V07|5.0|I recall hearing \\"Fade Into You\\" a few times on the radio, late at night, during the 90s -- never found out who the group was, and it haunted me.  The female vocalist's voice was so full of sadness, and I couldn't even make out half the lyrics 'cause it sounded like she'd washed down a handful of painkillers with a bottle of wine, but it was one of the greatest songs I'd ever heard. . . .<br /><br />A few years back, I was drowning my sorrows at a local pub when I heard this song over the satellite radio.  \\"Who is this?\\"  I ask the bartender.  She doesn't know, but calls the waitress and cook over.  The waitress thinks it's \\"The Sundays\\" and the cook thinks it's from \\"The Pallbearer\\" soundtrack.  They were both wrong, but after a bit of research at Amazon, Wikipedia, and the local record store, I FINALLY -- after a decade of wondering -- discovered Mazzy Star.<br /><br />I've since gotten all 3 albums, but \\"So Tonight I Might See\\" is -- by far -- the best.  Since Mazzy Star, I've gotten a number of other albums from the \\"trip hop\\" and \\"dream pop\\" genre -- some of which were quite good -- but this will always be at the top of my list.<br /><br />\\"So Tonight I Might See\\" is, IMHO, the best album of all time.  Nothing else is comparable.  It is truly in a class of its own.
B00005JPCD|5.0|I saw this last weekend at a special screening and was suitably impressed. Although I'm a big fan of George Miller's films, I was very hesitant to see this one. The trailers looked awful and indicated nothing about the story. Until the screening came up, I had no intention of seeing this on the big screen. After the opening musical number, the movie quickly won me over. The way it's made is incredibly cinematic, and, at its heart, tells a great mythic story: an outcast leaves his community and journeys to the edge of the world to find a way to end the famine that's plaguing his species. Along this quest, our hero, Mumble, learns to live with his outsider status (he can't sing) and makes use of his own particular gift (tap dancing). It's a simple story that's told in a very creative way with a lot of heart.<br /><br />The musical numbers, instead of having a disrupting effect and stopping the flow of the story, actually advance the plot because they're integral to the story and this particular type of penguin. Emperor Penguins apparently find their mates by singing. While it all sounds the same to us, they are highly attuned to each others songs. The film cleverly translates that idea to the screen by having these animated penguins sing iconic pop/rock songs.<br /><br />I thought the animation was top notch and the style perfectly suited for the story. This isn't the goofy cartoonish animation seen in this past year's other animal-oriented films. It's very rich and leaning heavily towards realism. The vast icy landscapes seem to be copied straight from documentary footage. Just jaw-droppingly beautiful.<br /><br />There's one shot in the film which really epitomizes how well made it is and made me love it that much more. Mumble, his four friends, and the old wise mentor (Lovelace) are heading to the edge of the world as they know it. They're caught in a snow blizzard. The six penguins are shown in almost a dark silhouette as they struggle to move forward. The fading red light of the sun provides faint illumination. As the penguins are pushed back by the blizzard, they lean into the wind and keep going. It's almost like something out of a Kurosawa movie. And that's all it is. Just one shot of the blizzard. But it's beautifully done. Never seen anything like it in an animated film.<br /><br />By the end of the film, my initial reservations about the film were completely washed away. Disregard the lame trailers and see it for yourself.fading red light of the sun provides faint illumination. As the penguins are pushed back by the blizzard, they lean into the wind and keep going.

B00080ZG10|3.0|I bought it... thought it would be very interesting but I feel some areas are missing. I have no idea whatever Howard is married or have any children... It is just much focus on his disorder and his planes... <br /> <br />The con of all is no closed caption on disk two for Modern Marvels: Howard Hughes, A Documentary by the History Channel. I am sure History Channel does have closed caption for it. I am deaf (born deaf) I am surprised no subtitle either... how can that benefit for me? I like history but that does not help me to understand that documentary. <br /> <br />I hate when movie didn't put in English subtitle or closed caption on something may be important for us to understand. That is waste. That is shame. <br />
B0002EXH4K|2.0|The point has come that nearly all great recordings have been remastered in some way, shape or form and subsequently re-released. Because of that I decided to get an iPod strictly for the purpose of \\"collecting\\" as many of my favorites as possible. My plan has been to buy most of them from Amazon or an Amazon seller & then put them on the pod. So much of my favorite music has been re-mastered (makes me feel old.. maybe cuz I am!) that this has become quite a project! Anyway, almost every re-mastered CD I've picked up has sounded better than the original. Some are improved so much that it's as if the album seems like a brand new release (PSBWB is a phenomenal example).  <br />Anyhow, I didn't realize that CTE was remastered AND remixed when I bought it. I expected it to be like all the other remasters I've listened to - a favorite album with much better clarity and a lot more boom.  <br />Countdown to Extinction is a masterpiece as far as I'm concerned, even though my favorite Megadeath album is probably Peace Sells.  <br />Countdown was (when first released) absolutely perfect - something no other Megadeath album had been. Dave had recently gotten sober if I recall corectly, and that along with the new guys made this a new sound with much more maturity than before. It was landmark to be sure. Did I mention it was perect?  <br />The reMIX was a horrible mistake in my book. If Dave wanted a remix for himself & burned it during the remaster work that would have been fine - but to release the so-called \\"Remastered\\" CTE in a completely different form SUCKS - I feel ripped off. I want the opportunity to own CTE in REMASTERED form without anything other than the quality of sound being tweaked. Maybe if enough people complain and continue to do so the nagging will eventually lead to such a release. Dave should be aware that potential NEW Megadeath fans were won over by the thousands with this album, and it probably continues to do so - but if the average CD of CTE floatingaround on the net or on store shelves 5 years from now is the remaster (and thus ALSO reMIXed), it will likely not win the new listener over. That's sad, because CTE is Megadeath's \\"Black\\" album - and the remix is a completely different album with completely different songs. It is not a remix or a remaster, it's a new release. Had this remixed version been what was released when CTE originally came out, it wouldn't be worth issuing as a remaster in the first place.  <br />I WANT MY CTE REMASTER!!!!
0385504209|1.0|So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know howit ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion.it ends. I don't care.

B000JJS8TM|5.0|Bloody great, amazing, simply magical album, wooooow, what can I say, what arrangements by George and Giles, simply the best of the best, thanks for such joy, I bought it two days ago, in México was released this week before any country in the world. The best Get Back ever. Thanks.
B00004TR2G|5.0|For those who have watched the movie Jaws (ask yourself, who hasn't) will know that one of many key elements that made the movie a huge success was the fantastic score John Williams did for it. This cd captures all the music from the movie perfectly, with some new elements thrown in that are not found in the film. <br /> <br />The linear notes are bright and colourful and provide some interesting information, which gives the overall package a nice touch. The overall cd package is certainly not a rushed effort and is worth every cent. A highly recommended purchase for those who love their soundtracks or anyone who wants to relive the film through the music.
B000J103X4|5.0|The bottomline is... the album is HARD... Whether it will be as much a commercial success as the first remains to be seen but in these days when so much music is all about being bouncy and lack of lyrical content, The Game is one of the few that people can listen to and hear both a tight beat and an ill flow/lyrics.  Whether or not what he is talking about is of interest is strictly dependant on an individual and what they like to hear, but he has proven he does not need Dre anymore.  I mean it is almost erie how he sounds exactly like Dre on many tracks, but the good Dre the Chronic Dre, and I am sure Snoop and Jay-z aren't writing his lyrics like they have in the past for Dre.  Although it would have been so nice to hear him again on a glorious and grimy Hi-Tek track without the interferance of Tony \\"Mayo\\" Yayo, his song with Just Blaze The Remedy, more than makes up for it...though it would have been nice, and he still had a nice Hi-Tek track.  I personally would have much rather hear Game on another Timbaland track then those poppy Scott Storch songs but I guess thats whats moving on the radio... Regardless of the producers, the people who produced on his album all but completely replaced Dre... The Swizz Beat track was decent but Swizz has been falling off for years with his constant sampling of rappers voices on tracks to save him, and I really can't believe that they let the \\"AHHHHHHHHHHH\\" sound on the chrous out of the studio, but thats 2006 I guess... The Kanye Track \\"Wouldn't Get Far\\" is a great concept but once again not Kanye's Best work, sorry Kanye I know you think your work is always the best... Its no \\"Dream\\"...but the song concept is good and very funny, sorry ladies who might be offended, the turth is the truth... The Track with Jamie Foxx should be a single, its hot, marketable, and it would give the Game a chance to diversify a little but I doubt it will be... The last song, with Nas was alright, I am sure people will praise Nas like it is the greatest thing they heard since Ether but its no illmatic and it's no stillmatic, Game outshined him which doesn't surprize me but I guess it's all a matter of opinion, Im from NY by the way so please don't think I am from the West because I think Nas has amazed me in years... Over all the lyrics have improved as has The Games flow, the beats are still knockin but with the exception of Just Blaze, the less known Producers on the album are the ones to look out for.  This album is worth buying without a doubt, especially if you have the first one, but were waiting to hear a Game album without 50 cent and the rest of his stoges on it. The Album Starts and Ends Great...A lot of rappers including Hov could probably learn a thing or two from this album, not saying Game is a better rapper but just cause someone can rap well doesn't mean their album will be good, no matter how much sales they get, radio play, or how much money they have, maybe one day these kids and adults that lack the knowledge of the history of the music that buy albums will realize that... Hope this review helps.  Peave and Love. <br />G
B000JJRIP2|3.0|Although Kiss Online and Best Buy advertise exclusive bonus songs, \\"2000 Man\\" & \\"God Of Thunder\\" from the Millenium Concert, these songs are NOT included in the BB set.  The copy I purchased even had it printed on a sticker on the plastic wrapping...\\"Featuring two previously unreleased bonus songs...\\".  I repeat, these songs can be found nowhere on the BB set.  I called 4 different Best Buy's in my area and was told it was...\\"not their problem\\".  They were completely disinterested in helping me.  If this is a case of false advertising I am sure I am not the only buyer who will be upset over this.  That said, the Millenium Concert is a must have for the Kiss completist.  3 stars for the quality of the remastered versions and for the inclusion of the MC.  I just wish it had come with the 2 bounus tracks as advertised!

They show a bunch of teenagers and hippies playing, drinking, throwing garbages and getting naked!!!!<br /><br />I saw a lot of dvds of 70's rock bands like Kissology, Black Sabbath vol. 1, Deep Purple and AC/DC but they are not good as this one. Led Zeppelin dvd has everything that a 70's rock fan like me should want!!!!!<br /><br />P.S: What was Guns and Roses in the early 90's, THAT WAS LED ZEPPELIN IN THE EARLY 70'S.<br /><br />Adios.
0446691437|5.0|Whatever it is that you know deep down you should be doing, Mr. Pressfield has some tough love to administer in your interest.  He labels the enemy, \\"resistance\\" and exposes that enemy in its various forms then proceeds to let you know that he knows exactly what's wrong with you - you are a coward.  That's right, in the end, it is giving into resistance in one form or another that stops you from living your potential.  Whether you are a writer, painter, software designer, whatever your calling may be, it is resistance that is beating you and you may not even know it.  Mr. Pressfield, in Marine Corps fashion, will expose the enemy within and then let you know he will not tolerate excuses any longer.  Let Mr. Pressfield tear into your resistance and help you get on track to what you were meant to be.  Very well done, marine.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|Fantastic theme, amazing effects, edge-of-your-seat action for about an hour, and then you just get tired.  The movie starts out with one poorly written decision after another.  (\\"Say, I think I'll run from the cops for ABSOLUTELY no reason and then get pissed that they arrest me\\") Unbelievable plot twists (You did at least watch someone else play the game, right guys?), and unexplained goings-on.<br /><br />The acting is great for the most part, and again, the effects are remarkable.  The imagery goes from normal to superatural with eerie speed and seemless conversion, but the part that really needs to be there \\"A story that can tie all this really cool stuff together\\", just isn't made of strong enough thread.<br /><br />Rent it for the effects.  Fast forward any time someone starts to speak.  The movie is just better that way. . .  = (
B000JJ4GW0|3.0|I am a huge U2 fan, and like many U2 fans, this compilation falls short. However, it has a purpose that is really not geared for the die hard fan. This album is meant to be a definitive collection of U2 songs over their career for the casual fan who may be new to the group. If one looks at it that way, this album is probably fine. This album is heavily weighted to the more recent popular albums (except \\"Pop\\" itself), and it does justice in picking those songs.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as a 1 disc compilation it is forced to neglect some early gems, namely \\"I Will Follow\\", which at the least is a definitive U2 song. It also fails in the sense that the casual U2 fan may in fact be more interested in hearing the more obscure greats. It does well in picking from the Joshua Tree, War, and the Unforgettable Fire (Pride, New Years Day, Sunday Bloody Sunday, Where the Streets Have No Name, etc.) but it neglects songs off of Boy, October, and other greats off of Zooropa, Pop that would probably be worth while to the casual fan who is looking for something new without necessarily buying each individual album first.<br /><br />In fact, I would say that if you are a new U2 fan and not aware of much pre- \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" or \\"Achtung Baby\\", you might be better off buying the earlier compilations \\"Best of - 1980-1990 or 1990-2000\\" they give a better sampling of U2's best during those periods. However, if you are content with the popular stuff of the last 5 years, this album will do you just fine.<br /><br />If you are a die hard fan who fails to see the purpose of this compilation, buy the two new songs online and don't support U2's effort here. Or, perhaps the DVD will appeal to you. Just realize that part of the reason of this compilation (and the previous ones) is to fill out a recording obligation, so that they can do more of what they want and perhaps go back and be a bit experimental as in the Achtung Baby / Zooropa days. The sooner they did this compilation, the sooner they can get to the new stuff.<br /><br />As for the song selection. If you are a real die hard U2 fan like I am, you've probably recorded your own greatest hits to fit your own needs. If you haven't, do so. You're better off doing that than complaining about the track listing here. Let this album be enjoyed by those who are still learning U2. In 10 years, they could be the biggest fans just like you and I.ilation, the sooner they can get to the new stuff.  <br /> <br />As for the song selection.

B00005JPB4|5.0|This was a different film from what I expected. Perhaps because I am a big fan of Band of Brothers, one of the best series ever produced, at least in my opinion, and this was very different.  <br /> <br />I found Flags of our Fathers to be slower paced, and thought provoking, although the war scenes were no less gory and terrible. But what was most fascinating was the juxtaposition of everyday normal life back home against the horrors of Iwo Jima. To me the duality of the film with the heroes of Iwo Jima touring the country while their fellow soldiers died in battle was extremely poignant. The breakout performance is that of Adam Beach who plays the tortured Native American Indian soldier living in guilt for surviving while his friends all died. A truly moving performance. <br /> <br />Apparently Mr. Eastwood has also directed a Japanese version of Iwo Jima, meant to be a companion piece to this film. Shot all in Japanese and telling the other side of the story, starring Ken Watanabe. I'm not sure when the US release will be but I will be anxious to see it. <br /> <br />For anyone who hasn't read the book, I urge you to do so. It is an excellent book that delves deeper into the lives of these soldiers and is a wonderful tribute by a son for his father.
0671578855|3.0|LMB may have a great writing talent, but that does not imply a great book. You also need a plot, and this has very little plotwise.  <br /> <br />It's just toooo predictable.

B000HIVIOW|2.0|What a delightful tale this is, too bad it is missing the warm and wonderful intro by David Bowie THAT IT CLAIMS TO HAVE ON IT BUT DOES NOT!!!!  The David Bowie bit was the main reason I bought this, I already have it on tape.  He should not be listed in the credits in the description nor on the DVD itself, false advertising, shame on Amazon. In fact looking at this very page it says by \\".....David Bowie...\\", ridiculous.
B000A2H812|2.0|These guys, at least on this album, are trying too hard (in my opinion) to cater to a certain audience. No need to name your album after the style of music you are playing. Granted, I am not familiar with their previous album, but this sounds like a mediocre attempt to re-create the Inferno sound. <br /> <br />If you want the real deal, skip this nonsense and head straight for the World/Inferno Friendship Society. I promise, you'll like it more. Particularly the album \\"Just the Best Party\\" and the new one, \\"Red-Eyed Soul\\"

B000AMJG4Y|3.0|I am a huge Final Fantasy fan. I have played through every single U.S.-released single-player Final Fantasy game (except for FF III a.k.a. FF VI, but I own it and I'll get around to playing it some day). I even was one of the dozen or so people that went to see the first Final Fantasy movie in the theater (The Spirits Within). I own a bunch of Nobuo's music CDs. I've played through Final Fantasy VII itself three times, on both the PC and the PlayStation, searching every tiny corner for secrets, until finally succumbing to the lure of playing through it a fourth time with a walkthrough. I am a FAN of this series.    I was disappointed in this film.    I watched it three times. The first time, I wasn't really paying attention, and I didn't quite get what was going on. So, the second time, I watched it in English, with English subtitles, to make sure I could get every word. I still didn't quite get it. So, I watched it in Japanese with English subtitles. That was better, because I wasn't distracted by how the lips didn't match up with the words (and the acting was far better), but even then, the plot just didn't make any sense. I'd rather not go into spoilers, but let's just say, I couldn't figure out what was supposed to be happening at the end, and how it was supposed to solve everyone's problems; it just didn't make logical sense. Seemed like a deus ex machina to me. Maybe someone can comment on this and fill me in.    Yes, it's great visually, and it was wonderful to hear some orchestrated versions of my favorite Nobuo tracks, and it was a lot of fun to see some of my favorite characters come back to life, but I just kept thinking... they could have done better with this. They needed a real screen-writer to tell them how to structure it so that an audience can follow it.    I still think you should buy it, as it's an astounding piece of art, but just don't expect too much from it.

Muse can mix energy, passion, and beauty like none other.

B000ICM5MG|5.0|What a great movie.  The first film is grittier and more realistic than the sequels, but they are all inspiration on a grand scale.  The character, himself, is a wonderful draw.  Rocky is a teddy bear.  A powerful, determined, dangerous teddy bear, but a teddy bear nonetheless!  The Rocky series is about love (and looking beyond the surface to recognize a person's true worth), self-respect and becoming a winner...even if you don't actually win.  For years my slogan was, \\"Never trust anyone who didn't love Rocky!\\"
B0002W4SWC|5.0|Most single women can relate to at least a page or two out of Bridget's diary.  Who, at one time or another, hasn't battled weight gain, a craving for cigarettes or fallen head over heels for the \\"wrong\\" guy?  Even though Bridget and Mr. Darcy set off sparks from the beginning, the fireworks tend to create friction rather than romance; however, there's little doubt the two of them will eventually get together.  Like a good friend, we \\"hold Bridget's hand,\\" as she discovers what a scoundrel Daniel Cleaver really is.  Along the way, we meet her loyal, if somewhat loopy friends; her endearingly eccentric parents; and of course, the dreamy Mr. Darcy.  Gather the girls around and spend a Friday night with a great gal pal, Bridget Jones!

B00008DDSC|5.0|Let's be honest. Sex is a fundamental aspect of all of our lives, yet most of us are really afraid to deal with it honestly. This movie deals with a particular aspect of sexuality in a refreshingly honest way. Whether you know anything about dominance/submission or not, this film is remarkable in that it gives us all a glimpse of what that particular sexual dynamic is all about, and it does it in a way that is quite frankly, non-sensational and non-gratuitous. And you do not need to have any affinity with dominance or submission to really 'get' and enjoy this movie, for it goes much deeper. This is a excellent character study.<br /><br />The film is quite erotic, although very little actual sex is shown. It's power is in the anticipation and what is NOT said. It's about NEED. As several other reviewers have brought out here, there's alot going on here besides the allure of a taboo form of sex. The beauty of the film is in it's subtlety and the depth of the characters, which the director takes time to develop.<br /><br />Both James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal are compatible complements in this story, which really is a story about 'complements'. It's about finding that balance in the energy between two people. There is a silent, powerful unspoken attraction between the two characters that transcends their established professional roles. The viewer can really just 'sense' this dynamic building throughout the film.<br /><br />There is so much here that is communicated just with the look in the eyes. There is so much that is unspoken, yet if you pay attention, you know what is going on. I think it's great film-making. In an age when we are innundated with quick, flash images every other second, sensational sex and violence for it's own sake, and a total LACK of character development, I find it refreshing to see a movie like this that moves slowly on purpose to develop the phyche of the characters, and Secretary does that superbly.<br /><br />I also find it refreshing that a film be made about this rather taboo subject with an non-judgmental, open honesty.

B000I5X81K|4.0|Actually I got a chance to listen the pieces in this CD when it just came out, and I have already waited for so long for Josh Groban having a new album come out. Listening this guy singing is kinda interesting and fun: he may not be the best in all of his works, but he has a power that let the audience to explore more different kinds of music in the world. His first album may lead people have attempt to listen real classical music; his second album \\"closer\\" may lead you listen some of the greatest songs in different countries, e.g. Oceano by lisa in Italy San Remo festival 2003, some well known songs like caruso (by Lucio Dalla), hymne a l'amour (by Edith Piaf), broken vow (by Lara Fabian), you raise me up (by secret garden). So this time he created an album that may help audience explore african music (lullaby, weeping), more \\"young-oriented, energetic\\" pieces (machine, in her eyes, mai, you are loved), some more \\"adult-comtemporary\\" songs a bit similar to Lara Fabian style (solo por ti, l'ultima notte, awake, verita, un dia llegara), and song originally was in blue style (smile). And there is one Italian movie track in each of his albums: 1. Cinema Paradiso, 2. Mi Mancherai from Il Postino, 3. Un Giorno Per Noi from Romeo and Juliet (this song is the most beautiful song in the \\"awake\\" album) But one thing really good is, in all these three albums, he did not just sing the words, he felt the power of lyrics, tried his best to express the message to audience. This time one more thing in this album that did not happen in last two albums is, I can feel that he really enjoy performing his pieces. Thats a really good thing being an artist, and being an amateur singer myself, I am glad that he had a good time in his singing. (and he is almost the same age as me) But, there are still something not perfect in this album hence I only give 4 stars: 1. The more \\"pop-oriented\\" songs can be better, either by his performance or by more suitable composing to fit his gorgeous voice (when I first listen this CD I already can predict that some audience may not like the selections in this CD due to different style, but thats OK since everybody has different preference), 2. even though the three extra songs in the special edition are beautiful, I don't think it is worth around $30 more including shipping...thats too expensive. Since he is still only 25, if he keeps on proper practicing and improving, I think one day he would be world famous, just like Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli did, he would become better and better, and it is a very good thing for such a great singer to become world famous isn't it? This absolutely helps raising the music standard all over the world. I wish him all the best in his career. Again he may not be the best (in fact there are many unknown vocalists or theater singers sing as good as or even better than him in the world, and I think Josh himself also know that), but the fact that he is good does not change, just there are people better does not mean he is not good, and he has a breath-taking power in his performances, had a power to influence people try other types of music, so why not enjoy his works? Moreover, I have a final paper that talks about crossover music all over the world, I think I may have to add some of his works in my paper :)
0767821629|4.0|Real interesting film here. The 13th floor is a brilliant conceptual film, and although I found it bit 'hollywood' with it's gratuitous 'action scenes', it still holds up as a really interesting story from start to finish. It also has one of those twists at the end that surprise you even when you thought all the surprises were understood. I like films that do that.<br /><br />The basic story of the movie is about a virtual reality software program that is so 'real' it actual can take a live person's consciousness and move into a cyber reality, like 1930 Los Angeles and the participant experiences life there exactly like his waking life here, only in that everything is the product of computer modelling. It's really a very interesting concept because that is what quantum physicists are saying our own brain does! All in all, a thoroughly entertaining movie. It's a brain teaser, and those who like science fiction and subjects that make you think outside the box, this one is a must see.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|George and Giles Martin deserve tons of credit.  Using today's technology, they did the unthinkable, making these 40 odd year old recordings into a fresh, new sounding package. Need I say...........brilliant. <br /> <br />As I said, I'm a purist. I believe it's a mortal sin to mess with the Beatles material. However, this project has the blessing of Paul, Ringo, Yoko & Olivia. It's also George Martin, so who am I to argue? The sound of so many of these songs and pieces is so much fuller, and in some cases brighter. <br /> <br />Half the fun of listening to this is picking out which parts of which songs the bits and pieces are from. We hear the drum intro from Why Don't We Do It In The Road? We hear a simple intro from Don't Pass Me By. Blackbird merging into Yesterday. Did you ever think you would hear Within You, Without you being sung to the music of Tomorrow Never Knows? Lady Madonna now has a guitar solo; the riff from Hey Bulldog! Mr. Kite  is all of the sudden I Want You (She's So Heavy). In George Martin's final project, he scores a string ensemble (a la Yesterday) to the beautiful, simple acoustic version of While My Guitar Gently Weeps. I could go on and on. <br /> <br />It makes one wonder what The Beatles could do in today's digital studios.  It also keeps the Beatles with \\"new\\" music being released, to a generation of new fans. <br /> <br />Some Beatles fans may not like this as much as I do, but I find it hard to believe any would not like it. Non-fans will be introduced to sounds they've never heard. Many will be prompted to listen to the original versions of these great classic songs. <br /> <br />One final note. The listener should not compare this to the original version of the songs. That is not the purpose of this project, and you will get much more out of it by focusing on what it is. Brilliant!  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Just get this concert and listen to it. That's it...nothing more. It's a 'must have.'
B00003CXRM|5.0|We rented this movie, and after seeing it once, we bought it because we knew we'd watch it over and over.  Everyone in my house loves it, young and old.  It was recommended by the textbook my children used for Homer's Odyssey, and at first, I thought the writer of the textbook was crazy, but when I saw the movie, I understood.  The movie follows Ulysses (the Latin version of the name Odysseus) Everett McGill through his adventures with the Lotus-eaters, the Cyclops, the sirens, you name it.  And who would have thought you could find a Cyclops in Depression-era Mississippi?  This is a great movie:  a great plot, a great script, great acting, a great look and feel, and a great sound track. It's very touching, and really funny.  It's a musical, but not the Rogers and Hammerstein kind -- the characters don't just break into song for no reason. Well, except when they decide to \\"sing into the can\\" at the radio station.  They are simply surrounded by music, and really fun music that adds to a really fun movie.  So read Homer's Odyssey, and then watch this movie. You won't regret it.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Despite the almost ten year hiatus, Loreena returns- shining as always- in her latest release, \\"An Ancient Muse.\\"  <br /> <br />It has been almost ten years since Loreena bridged the gap between what we perceive to be New Age, World and an inflection of rock sensibilities.  She fused music together in a truly innovative way that reflected beautifully in her releases \\"The Book of Secrets and \\"The Mask And The Mirror.\\"  In \\"An Ancient Muse\\" this past glory is not only reflected, but built upon.  <br /> <br />Beginning with \\"Invocation,\\" (A song reminiscent of \\"Prologue\\" in her \\"Book of Secrets\\" album) Loreena cleverly weaves a magical style of rhthym and melody that is all her own.  Throughout the tracks on this album that specific, wondrous style shines through clearly.  For instance, during the ritually methodic \\"The Gates of Istanbul,\\" she builds upon a single rhythm to deliver a song that's breathtaking.  One can clearly see the journey she speaks of, not only in her lyrics, but in the music itself. <br /> <br />Whether you have long been a fan of Loreena's, or have never listened to her music, \\"An Ancient Muse\\" delivers perfectly.  I can not recommend this album highly enough!

B000J103PC|5.0|I find it hard to believe people have written negative reviews of this movie.  Maybe they just didn't get it.  The characters are fully fleshed out and you know what motivates them.  Miranda is so bitchy it's hilarious.  Granted I think most of us wouldn't tolerate a boss like her.  I know I certainly wouldn't.  Fans of Project Runway will find it irresistible.<br /><br />Stand out scenes, Miranda explaining the difference between blue and cerulean.  Andy's makeover and pretty much every scene Stanley Tucci is in.
B000JJ4GW0|5.0|I'm a U2 diehard fan from Chile, and i love their music. The new 2 songs are excelent. This compilation incorpores a beautiful booklet with details of the chart position when each single was launch in USA and UK. U2 has an important place in my life - and i wonder what a lot of people in the world think and feel the same -, so we must celebrate, and wait until the new record is edited - and the begining of the new tour -. If you love U2, you must have this cd. <br />
B000000993|5.0|I know I will catch a lot of flack for such a bold statement.  But I'm not a prog rock purist.  The music I like leans to the more melodic. Of all their albums this is the most accessible and melodic.  Other Tool albums seem to be so restrained to me.  Like you're just waiting for them to cut loose and drop the hammer but they never do.  They did with this one. Stand out track for me is #4 Bottom. catchy bass hook, razor sharp guitars, maynard at his best and guest spoken word by Henry Rollins, it doesn't get any better than that.
B0000A118M|5.0|This disc ranks as one of the most moving recordings these ears have ever heard. The haunting chant of the chorus during the title track really allows a listener to feel as though they were there in the studio. It is amazing what Coltrane did with just instruments and skilled musicians. There wasn't any electronic amplification or sweetening here. One has to wonder just what would have been accomplished if they were allowed to utilize some of the equipment at our disposal today. \\"Acknowledgement\\" is a rolling tidal wave of emotions. Grab it and feel the love !
0316172324|3.0|This book is basically a collection of various stories and their relationships to \\"Blink\\"ing, or \\"thin-slicing\\". The stories are interesting, and the book is somewhat engaging, but it all seemed somewhat incoherent. I came away from the book feeling as if I didn't gain anything new other than a couple interesting stories and maybe a fact or two. It's a good rental from the library, but nothing I'd buy again.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Without too much fanfare, let's just say that this small gem of a movie is excellent.  Certainly more thoughtful, better constructed, and infinitely more entertaining than \\"The Prestige\\", this film provides a delightful evening's viewing.  It is not a great film by any means, but engaging nonetheless.<br /><br />To emphasize my point in the comparison of the two films I present the facts.  I viewed \\"The Illusionist\\" on my own since no one else seemed interested.  A short time later \\"The Prestige\\" arrived and my best friend suggested we see the film together.  He was greatly unimpressed and actually felt we had wasted our time.  I suggested that we immediately see another film of the same genre and he agreed.  His comment: there is no comparison, \\"The Illusionist\\" is a far better film.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and don't miss this fine film.
0763631205|5.0|I collect \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and this is a particularly lovely volume.  The illustrations are wonderful and the overall quality, printing, binding and paper, is terrific.  This is definitely in my top three favorites of all the different versions I own.

The arrangements are beautiful, and I now have a much greater appreciation for this group.  The are not \\"just a band\\" but a true musical force, and the songs are fresh & refreshing & engrossing.  Could I pick one favorite arrangement?  No.  All 26 tracks HAD to be imported into my iPod.  I even burned a backup in case anything ever happens to the original.  Must buy!
B00005JP9V|5.0|it touched me and made me think of all the children we, as human race, take for granted, don't care for and abuse.<br /><br />children are miracle, and joy, and should be cared for lest they be taken away from us.<br /><br />sometimes i do think god would be better off wiping us out by another plague or, as in this movie, by worldwide sterility.<br /><br />if we are not able to care for children of the world, they should be taken away from us, and with them our hope, our future, our joy of life.<br /><br />excellent direction and cast notwithstanding, the power of this movie is in the fact that it made me think, it made me cry, and it made me care even more. it made me care to the point of being determined to do something for children of men we see in the news hungry, maimed, abandones, abused, sold, exploited.<br /><br />we can and should, as race, take care of our children.

I'd be hard-pressed to find one favorite, but if I had to pick it would be \\"Nights in White Satin\\".  I always thought the song was catchy but this time it was engrossing!  Don't just listen to a snatch of it- buy it and immerse yourself in the full effect!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|The stereo CD contains 78 minutes of music. The DVD surround sound version on DVD disc album is slightly extended version with 81 minutes of music.<br /><br />FIRST OF ALL THE SURROUND IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />After being asked by the remaining Beatles, Ringo and Paul, along with Yoko Ono Lennon and Olivia Harrison, to make experimental mixes from their master tapes for a collaboration with Cirque du Soleil, Sir George Martin, The Beatles legendary producer, and his son Giles Martin have  worked with the entire archive of Beatles recordings to create LOVE. The result is an unprecedented approach to the music. Using the master tapes at Abbey Road Studios, Sir George and Giles have created a unique soundscape. The release of this album, which is also featured in the Cirque du Soleil/Beatles collaborative production of the same name at The Mirage in Las Vegas.<br /><br />This album puts the Beatles back together again, because suddenly there's John, Paul,George and Ringo.<br />The music is stunning. I think the most amazing thing about it is that you can pull it apart and all the elements carry with it the essence of the entire song.<br />George and Giles Martin highly original work in creating the LOVE album gives us a genuinely new Beatles album. It makes us respect even more, if that were possible, the creativity and brilliance of the band behind the greatest catalogue in the history of recorded music.<br /><br />The 5.1 disc is a DVD-Audio/DVD-Video hybrid. The audio is presented in high-resolution 96/24 5.1 surround on the DVD-Audio part of the disc. The DVD-Video part carries 5.1 surround in DTS and Dolby Digital as well as a PCM stereo mix. This DVD album is designed to be played on DVD video equipment but will carry no video component.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) \\"just works\\" as a wonderful fantasy and Classical Hollywood cinema. And Warners certainly had the \\"pick of the litter\\" when it came to the cast: Errol Flynn [Australia], Basil Rathbone [South Africa], Claude Rains [England],Olivia de Havilland [born in Japan of English parents], Alan Hale, Eugene Pallette [United States]!It is an exuberant adventure about the second best known English name (after Willaim Shakespeare)and shows Errol Flynn in all his youth and promise.The Adventures of Robin Hood is one of the first \\"feel good\\" movies and your suspension of disbelief is rewarded with an joyous affirmation of life.  This restored print is a visual feast of techincolor and its \\"too\\" perfect contrast of colors in clothing and setting adds to the sense of a fantasy world. It is a black and white world of good and evil.<br /><br /> We all know the story: Robin of Locksley is stripped of his Lands, Title and Liberty by the despotic usurper, Prince John: a Norman. In the act of restoring his name and property, Robin facilitates the return of rule of law to the Saxon people and restoration of the throne to Richard the Lionheart. And of course you can't have plausable \\"goodies\\" without plausable \\"badies\\".<br /><br />Without Rathbone's portrayal of Sir Guy of Gisbourne as a capable, intelligent screen presence to make us believe he means what he says when he shouts, \\"let me ram those words down his throat, your Highness!\\" Robin Hood would have no worthwhile adversary. I mean just imagine Robin Hood having the climactic sword-fight the cowardly blustering Sheriff of Nottingham (Melville Cooper) ~ it would look like something out of \\"The Court Jester\\".<br />A serious sword fight between Danny Kaye and Basil Rathbone, as the equally villainous Sir Ravenhurst would have been nothing short of ridiculous.<br />Add the icy effete evil of Raines' Prince John to Gisbourne's menace and Flynn really has his work cut out for him!<br /><br />Of course The Adventures of Robin Hood never lets the truth get in the way of a good story; the lively exchange between Robin and the incognito King Richard, in Sherwood Forest, could never have taken place; Richard spent almost no time in England and like earlier Plantagenet kings, could barely speak English.<br />But never mind all of that, this is a film is from the Classical Hollywood period, and with Michael Curtiz brought in to direct a film on the verge of disaster it became wonderful Saturday mattinee escapism to another heroic time and place.<br /><br />The Adventures of Robin Hood is pure entertainment and the \\"extras\\" on the second disc in the set are further good reasons to get this Special Edition DVD. The doccos on Robin Hood through the Ages; Alan Hale was to play Litte John in three movies, Robin Hood (1922), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), Rogues of Sherwood Forest (1950). And the History of the Technicolor process, docco is well worth a look.

0743454529|5.0|You  won't regret reading htis book. It adds to the human experience and you come away from it enriched by both the writing and the content. It explores areas of morality worth thinking about without telling you how to think.  It's hard to read at times because the author so aptly describes the human experience that it can be painful.....but that is life afterall.  I recommend it as a book that promotes growth.  It is strictly a secular book in that God is never invoked, and that is where I would have changed it a bit... I believe that all of life is providentially designed, and an acknowledgement of that would have given some hope beyond human endeavors. But then, I am not the author and do not possess the gift of being a wonderful writer like Jodi does!  From start to finish, it is a wonderful, wonderful book that I highly recommend.  If you ever read these reviews, Jodi, let me thank-you for enriching my life. Sincerely, Arden Detweiler
B000I5X80G|2.0|I found this recording disappointing....the sonics are ok but say compared to the Allman's at this venue...it pales....it's interesting to hear Young in this incarnation...most of the songs mirror his Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere album... his redwoods backdrop..dog sitting there...pendleton shirt...it captures that time...just wish it sounded better...this is the 21st century...not eight track heaven...
1577314808|4.0|I rate this book a four because it has many beautifully stated gems about the spiritual life that are most likely based on the author's genuine interior experience.  When he stays within his own experience of reality, I think he writes well and brings to life some difficult to understand spiritual ideas.<br /><br />On the other hand, Eckhart Tolle inserts some opinions that could use more examination.  These are referenced by other reviewers and I see no need to repeat what they have already highlighted.<br /><br />The perspective I would like to add is that despite this book's shortcomings, it is genuinely inspirational in many ways.  It clearly describes what living in the moment means and in places the elucidation of difficult concepts is brilliant.  I think for the ideas that it does explain well, it merits a high rating.<br /><br />I also think it is important to distinguish between another's interior experience vs. an analysis of objective reality as understood by science.  This book is more like poetry than science, but sometimes poetry can shed more light on an important topic.  However, poetry is not as \\"tight\\" as mathematics and therefore, one must accept a trade-off between depth and certainty.<br /><br />I wouldn't rely on this as a one size fits all text.  However, it is very thought provoking and certainly worth serious consideration for the many topics it handles beautifully.  On the other hand, one should read critically and compliment this book with other opinions from different angles.<br /><br />I love the expression that truth is not an idea, it's a state of consciousness.  This book takes this as a tacit starting point and writes from a perspective of full engagement with reality.  I'm sure you will get many useful insights from it, even if you are annoyed by some of its shortcomings.
038533348X|5.0|If you do not feel like reading what I think about the book, and just want a recommendation `yes, go for it / no, you would be wasting your time', go to the end of my review. If, on the other side, you want to know what I do think about `Cat's cradle', keep reading.<br /><br />Politics, religion and God, love and friendship, life and death. All is nonsense for Vonnegut. All is scorned, ridiculed. Or maybe he just tries to throw to the trashcan the absolute character we, human beings, tend to give to all those supposed absolutes. It could sound hard, but probably he is right in some way. Think about love, think how sometimes we just idolize the object of our longings: oh, I would do whatever you want me to do (and whatever means whatever--that crazy we can be). Then, for some reason, you realize the worshipped idol is not such, but just a human being, like me or you. All those great thoughts, ideals, aspirations (`I'll take the moon for you') just blow out. The result: a huge disappointment, a crisis. Any solutions? Yes, realize that love, or friendship, politics, morals, and everything else, are relative. And I am not saying that their value change with circumstances, but that any single of these elements should not be the sole foundation of our life and way of acting. Maybe I should think more about this, but it makes sense to me. My personal experiences tell me so.<br /><br />Anyway, the book is good, funny most of the times, and it makes you think. Worth the time and the money.
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins doesn't like the butters, but I truely hope he doesn't expect his improbability argument to win the day by converting a single creationist or intelligent designer to the creed of atheism. No dyed-in-the-whool believer will see anything new here. This is just the same old trench warfare. Somebody wrote that Dawkins is preaching to the choir. Exactly.<br />For people like me, somewhere on Dawkins' scale of atheism and agnosticism, this book is very entertaining. I love RD's skirmishes with God's various warriors. I love his little vanities, like when he coquettishly calls Douglas Adams his single convert. Man, I bet you got dozens (hundreds? thousands?) of mails telling you of more converts. I was not one of your converts, but only because I was already approximately where I am now when I ran into the selfish gene and saw it as an eye-opener towards Darwinism. I came more from the Marx corner at that time.<br />I agree with most of what RD writes here, except with his strong conviction that improbability is the decider. It wouldn't be for me if I needed convincing.  And, actually, I am not fully satisfied with his claim that he showed the Darwinian purpose of religion. Maybe I need to read that again.<br />Well, I also have a problem with the meme theory as it stands.There may be something there, but I am not happy with the nearly dogmatic insistence on calling this tentative concept \\"Darwinian\\".

B000JJS8TM|5.0|My first thought, as a fairly rabid Beatles fan, when I heard about \\"Love\\" was \\"SACRILEGE!\\"  So I approached this disc with much trepidation and skepticism.  I am very pleased to say that I was wrong.  While not a replacement for any Beatles album or song (hopefully nobody looks at is as such), it is a great addition to the library.  Oh, and note that this should probably not be anyone's 'intro to The Beatles'...they should probably get \\"1\\" for that. <br /> <br />Basically, this is a 'mash-up' of various Beatles material.  While that might sound like it would result in a mess, it really does work here.  The key is that the source material is so, so good...The Beatles, more than any other artist I've known, were not only incredible songwriters, they were the best at what I call \\"moments\\".  Their songs contain so many little passages, hooks, riffs, progressions or whatever that 'catch your ear' that you can listen and listen and still discover new things after years of fandom.  It is one of the things I've loved the most about them.  Bits of guitar solos, the particular way a drum fill works against (or with) a bass riff...Beatles songs have SO many of these \\"moments\\".   <br /> <br />What \\"Love\\" does is take many of these \\"moments\\" and apply them to other songs or parts of songs.  The result is astounding.  This is not to say that there isn't the occasional miss...there are a few, but very few.  Take the a cappella vocal track from \\"Because\\" and apply the 'nature' effects from \\"Across the Universe\\"...it makes it a hymn to nature.  Take bits of \\"The End\\" and various other guitar parts and it turns into a jam. <br /> <br />Anyone who is a fan of 'pop' (XTC, Robyn Hitchcock, They Might Be Giants, The Shins, any one of the indie pop bands out there now, etc.) will have much to catch their ear in this.  If you like Olivia Tremor Control, Frosted Ambassador, Neutral Milk Hotel or any other band that has made effective use of \\"soundart\\", you will find much of interest here (and since The Beatles and Brain Wilson are the ultimate inspiration for most of that type of band, it is fitting to revisit their music this way). <br /> <br />Oh, one final note...the sound quality is nothing short of amazing.  The \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" track, which is actually quite stripped down compared to most on here (a testament to the 'rightness' of that song), makes you feel as if you are sitting in amongst the instruments (in a small room).  The mastering here puts the standard CD versions of the albums very much to shame.  The stereo mix has been very carefully done to provide a nearly perfect soundstage (I've not yet listened to the surround version, but am anxiously awaiting a day when I have the house to myself so I can carefully position my speakers and crank it to '11'.). <br /> <br />I could go on here but you get the point...take some of The Beatles best musical moments, mix them up (with great care and an ear for flow), clean up the source material until it sparkles, apply a tiny bit of psychedelic soundart philosophy, and you get \\"Love\\".  It will make you smile, sing along, glory in The Beatles mastery of their craft and...dig out your collection and re-listen to every single album with, perhaps, a new ear.

Wodehouse is perhaps the great comic author of the 20th century English speaking world. And these series does Wodehouse justice to the great credit of the series' actors and writers.<br /><br />But unfortunately the video to DVD transfer, in terms of picture and colour quality, leaves something to be desired. I have seen single series DVD versions of the Jeeves & Wooster and their video colour quality is superior to the reproduction in this complete set. Hopefully one of these days we will see a complete digital remastering of the series, but this box set is visually disappointing. It's a shame the excellent work of the writers, directors and actors has had below average DVD transfer. The 'standard' transfer quality we are used to these days is generally very good, not so here.
B000001DYA|3.0|Blue Cheer were a psychedelic-era power trio in the mold of the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream.  Although they are often credited with pioneering the heavy metal genre, that honor would have to be reserved for Hendrix and Cream.  The band did take decibel levels to unparalleled extremes, however, beating other power trio's such as Grand Funk Railroad and Mountain to the mega-punch by a year or so.  Their reason for cranking up the volume, however, may have been as much to hide the still rather obvious musical limitations of the band members as it was to venture into uncharted seas.  It is much more entertaining, after all, to hear Leslie West or Eric Clapton shred paint from rafters than the Cheer's Leigh Stephens.<br /><br />While Blue Cheer was the name of a laundry detergent, it was also slang for a particular strain of LSD.  It's about as likely that the band had phosphates rather than acid in mind as it is that 'Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds' wasn't a John Lennon acronym for LSD.  Just look at their hair.  But these boys weren't solid psychedelic rockers.  Their bent was much more in the blues-rock tradition, as evidenced by bassist Dickie Peterson's compositions 'Out of Focus' (which features a tasty bridge as one of the few instrumental zeniths on the disc), 'Doctor Please' (a meandering 7:53 foray into grunge 'n' sludge, a fitting complement to lyrics which basically add up to beggin' for drugs), and 'Second Time Around', about an on-and-off again relationship, which tacks some psychedelic sound effects on the end, seemingly as an afterthought rather than a coherant extension of the piece.<br /><br />The band exists on a much higher plane when it comes to cover tracks, which claim one-half of the selections offered.  All three of these numbers have been, or would be, covered by other, more competent performers, even when it comes to Blue Cheer's singular claim to fame, their number 14 cover of Eddie Cochran's 1958 scorcher, 'Summertime Blues'.  Despite Cheer's commendable effort, The Who's 1970 version from 'Live At Leeds' blows their version away.  Blowing away anything by Blue Cheer is no small accomplishment, but The Who did it in a big way.  Blue Cheer returned to 1958 to pick up another widely covered rock track, B.B. King's 'Rock Me Baby', partially credited to Joe Josea (although King has claimed sole credit for the composition), and also covered by the likes of Deep Purple, Lee Michaels, Ike and Tina Turner, and Eric Clapton.  It's one of the better tracks on the disc, but it comes up short to what performers like Clapton and even Lee Michaels did with it.  Finally, we have a version of Mose Allison's 'Parchment Farm', about doing time on a prison farm in Mississippi.  It contains the interesting sentiment that \\"all I did was shoot my wife... she wasn't any good\\", yet \\"I didn't do anything wrong\\".  Not sure who can identify with that...<br /><br />Blue Cheer is an interesting artifact in 1960's rock, and if you're into loud, distorted guitar music, you probably won't be offended by any of this, and may actually enjoy much of it.  Unfortunately for most of us, better versions of the cover songs offered here are readily available, and Blue Cheer's own compositions are clearly second tier.  Three stars, primarily for bravado.  Worth a listen, but sure to gather a lot of dust on your shelf.e Cheer's commendable effort, The Who's 1970 version from 'Live At Leeds' blows their version away.

B00005ASGI|1.0|There are many reasons why I find this particular volume very forgettable and missable; in fact, this volume falls into the \\"give this a miss\\" category and ranks among the worst ever among all 3 seasons.  In the first episode, we have a ridiculous looking creature that makes me laugh more than shudder in fear reminding me a lot of Paul from the \\"Electric Company\\" and we also see a racist side to Kirk when he automatically assumes that as the doctor assisting Bones is black and so he is somehow not competent and he needs reassuring from Bones that the black doctor is good at his job and hence good enough to tend to the injured Spock.<br /><br />The second episode is worse with a very weak storyline and portrays Kirk at his sexist best with the way he manipulates his female jailor.  The storyline is very far-fetched and the only redeeming factor is the humourous exchange on the Enterprise among Bones, Scottie and Spock when the latter suggests the other 2 mount a mutiny.<br /><br />If you are picking which volumes to keep, avoid this one at all costs; you have been warned!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I've always loved John Mayer's songwriting, he has a way of saying just what you've always thought and expressing your frustrations and joys. Maybe because I've never heard someone completely \\"get\\" Gen-X like John does, and he makes you feel like you're going to be alright no matter how crappy life gets, or is, as a struggling young person these days.  <br /> <br />This album is a true gem, if you love him you'll love this. I've never seen an artist release a fourth album that is better or just as good as his debut album. Get it if you haven't, you cannot be disappointed.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|I was excited for this album a little skeptical but excited the las vegas show is a great idea.  The music would be great in the show, not so much to listen too.  Most of the songs could be made by a 10 year old slowing and speeding up the tracks on a computer and adding a guitar riff here and there.  The song titles are not telling the truth for example blackbird/yesterday, i thought that could be cool, my kids love the black bird song, 6 seconds of the guitar from blackbird than yesterday starts.  There is not 26 songs here some are just plain noise with a 10 second guitar riff.  If you do not like the beatles alot or are heavily into acid and shrooms this might be a good buy for you.
B000002JKA|4.0|It's almost impossible for me to assign anything less than four stars to an album from these guys.  The outstanding musicianship alone raises them above all the pretenders and wanna-be's.  I have to keep in mind that this was recorded in 1993-94 and it reflects the taste and style of progressive metal in that time period.  Especially James LaBrie's over-the-top vocals on most of the songs.  I realize that some actually prefer the band's identity and sound at this stage of their history but I'm just not one of them.  I have three other albums made since this came out and I like every one of them more than \\"Awake.\\"  Scary vocals aside, though, the songs are challenging, intricate and very memorable.  \\"Erotomania,\\" \\"The Silent Man\\" and \\"Space-dye vest\\" in particular.  Overall, it is a good effort and well worth purchasing but I'm still intrigued by the more modern track they are currently running on.
B000301YY8|5.0|'Back to Bedlam' was given to me by my lady. I first listened to 'You're Beautiful' on my local rock station in Sydney. And I instantaneously fell in love with the song. It is a touching and wonderful song about unrequieted love, a love that cannot be had - a longing for things to be different but you know it cannot be different. This is the debut album from James Blunt a former Brittish soldier turned musician. And he has shown he has a great talent. This album is packed with 5 great songs 'Wisemen', 'Goodbye My Lover', 'So Long Jimmy' and 'No Bravery'. Most notable however are Goodbye My Lover and You're Beautiful. For along time local radio stations played these two songs several times a day.<br /><br />James Blunt brings to Brittish pop/rock a sense of much needed innocence and faith. All his songs are about the heart and about how hearts can hurt and show love. I cannot get enough of this superb album and all I can say is if you like You're Beautiful, you shall so enjoy the rest of Blunt's songs.<br /><br />This CD is truly beautiful and a great listen.

No company claims to be a bunch of losers who don't know what they're doing...part of ...the delusion is that entrepreneurs invariably believe that they're telling investors something new...'

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I've never been a fan of My Chemical Romance or the entire Emo/Punk genre, but this is an incredible album.  This album is as pure as rock can be. <br /> <br />It's obvious from the very beginning of the album that The Black Parade was influenced by Pink Floyd's The Wall and Queen's A Night at the Opera.  But the CD as a whole remains original, and every track is catchy, memorable, and addictive.  There are so many styles that are explored here, and the only moments where this CD falters slightly are in the first single \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\".  The song starts promisingly with a bombastic intro, but then it goes into a stock emo/punk riff which thankfully ends soon enough for the orchestration to come back in before you grow tired of it. <br /> <br />The thing that truly makes this album so incredible is the guitarwork.  I'm glad to see that bands like Avenged Sevenfold, System of a Down, and My Chemical Romance are starting to bring an increased musicality into the mainstream.  The riffs on display here are intricate and just as well done as anything from The Rolling Stones to Iron Maiden.  Definitely grand stuff here. <br /> <br />All in all, this is the best rock album to come out in the past year.
B00006G8K0|5.0|Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, two names that would become synonymous with Hammer Studios and the horror genre.  A rebirth of classic horror came in the form of \\"The Curse of Frankenstein,\\" and would continue with scores more.  \\"The Horror of Dracula\\" is probably the best loved of the Hammer catalogue, due to the strong story line, the great atmosphere, and the superb acting by the entire cast.  I agree, `the Horror of Dracula\\" is a classic gothic horror movie and a treasured film in the Hammer Studios collection.  Though Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are excellent in their roles, I must give special mention to Michael Gough (as Jonathan Harker) who also turns in a great performance.  This dvd is not only one that you should add to your classic horror collection, but a dvd that every classic horror collector's dvd collection should not be without!  Don't any of the other Hammer Horror films on dvd, including the Universal Pictures release of \\"The Hammer Horror Series\\" featuring some of Hammer's best! Also Warner Bros box set, \\"The Hammer Horror Collection,\\" with even more great classics!

6300138798|5.0|Talking Heads was a band I knew a few songs of by name, and I saw a couple of their videos and their performance of \\"Take Me To The River\\" on Saturday Night Live.  I felt that philosophically they were pretty nihilistic (no meaning to life).  But I decided to view this anyways.<br /><br />After watching this, I have one question with a follow up:  Are the Talking Heads in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  And if not, why not?<br /><br />I thought the development of the concert was creative.  First, a note that there are four members to the band, but they also had five other additional musicians perform with them.  However, it wasn't until the seventh song (the classic \\"Burning Down The House\\") that all nine musicians were on stage.  It starts with lead singer/guitarist David Byrne coming on stage with an acoustic guitar and a tape player, and did the first song \\"Psycho Killer\\" solo with guitar and rhythm track, on a bare stage with some tape markings.  After each song, he was joined by another band member and their instruments, and it wasn't until the fifth or sixth song that a backdrop covered the back of the stage.<br /><br />One thing I enjoyed is that the band seemed to be enjoying themselves, especially drummer Chris Frantz and additional guitarist Alex Weir.  The most serious looking performer was Byrne, but you still sensed he was enjoying himself as well.<br /><br />One of my favorite performers is Christian singer Steve Taylor.  I know Taylor had been influenced by Bowie.  After seeing this movie, I wonder if Taylor was also influenced by Byrne.<br /><br />Maybe this band is as nihilistic as I guessed at first.  However, they know how to give an effective concert, and I enjoy their style of music as well.

B00003CXDU|4.0|Is \\"Galaxy Quest\\" a movie I feel everyone needs to see?  No.  But if you like either comedies, Star Trek, or movies about people stepping up to responsibilities they were not sure they could handle, you will like this movie.<br /><br />I would divide what many call \\"science fiction\\" into three categories:<br /><br />1) \\"True Science Fiction\\", which is based on realistic speculation (e.g. \\"Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea,\\" \\"Flowers For Algernon\\");<br /><br />2) \\"Science Fantasy\\", which has a space setting, but is more of a fantasy in space than something based on true speculation (e.g. \\"Star Wars\\"); and<br /><br />3) \\"Science Horror\\", which often leans more toward the first category, but in this case it is a horror story in a space/sci-fi setting (e.g. \\"Alien\\").<br /><br />This movie is clearly in the second category.<br /><br />I see parallels between this movie and two others.  One is \\"Three Amigos\\", another comedy about actors who are mistaken for being heroes, and finding themselves having to become heroes.  The other is \\"Space Camp\\", about a woman and several kids accidentally sent into space.  The \\"Three Amigos\\" parallel probably has been noted in other reviews; while this is more of a comedy, I feel with the size of the cast that there are a lot of similarities with \\"Space Camp.\\"<br /><br />One thing I'll mention is that I am not really a Tim Allen fan.  I'm not a Tim Allen hater either, but for me, he was neither a draw nor, for the most part, a distraction from the movie.  I could never picture him being cast as a serious starship captain.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is good, though I think Sigourney Weaver was over-qualified as an actress for her role.  Alan Rickman was excellent in his role, an excellent crumudgeon.

B000I5X81K|5.0|I'm certainly confused about some of the negative reviews here and the reasons for them.  It amazes me that so many posting here are stuck in a musical rut. <br />The talent that Josh called on to help with this album is impressive.  If you haven't looked into the making of the album, it would be worth the effort.  <br />There's a lot of music out there, some good - some questionable - but something for everyone.  So it's sad when people aren't open to new ideas or hate it when their favorite artists deviate from what's the \\"norm\\" for him/her as though they were made only to sing one kind of lyric or type of music. - like a \\"Machine\\". <br />To those of you who aren't sure about his music, there are plenty of opportunities to hear the songs before buying the album - who couldn't figure that out?   <br />But it's well worth listening - you may, like his fans, find that something special in his voice, the music he chooses because he's so musically gifted and knows how to surround himself with stunning talent, and who he is.   <br />But at least listen with an open mind if you're curious - it appears some haven't.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Break out the headphones for this one.    Sir George Martin & Son have put together an entertaining collage of Beatle songs, using tracks and snippets from every corner of the vault. Some of the juxtapositions are merely cute, but every now then comes a virtuostic passage that will take your breath away.    The clarity of the remixes is simply stunning. Although I'm a crusty old purist, it is now obvious that all of the albums need to be completely remixed from the original tracks. The new mixes will never replace the priceless originals, but LOVE conclusively reveals the riches that were buried by the limitations of 1960s technology.    Wait till you hear \\"I Am the Walrus\\" in TRUE STEREO ... ALL of it, from start to finish, not just the first third!    The only reason this CD gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the compression. The entire production is HEAVILY compressed from start to finish. A disc that could have been an audiophile showcase instead sounds like it was mastered for Nine Inch Nails or Britney. What a shame.    Still, I suppose you'll simply have to buy this.

B000I0QM04|3.0|SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW comes off as too campy and too two-dimensional.  Polly Perkins (Gyneth Paltrow) and Joseph \\"Sky Captain\\" Sullivan just don't ever come to life as characters.  We never get to see why they do what they do, or why they're romantically drawn to each other -- except for the handsome rogue and the independent woman that they are.<br /><br />The plot is almost a standard culled from any of the 1930s science fiction magazines, and even takes a few riffs from Max Fleischer's Superman cartoon with the giant robots wreaking havoc in the streets.  After the Great War (World War I), several scientists were pulled into a think tank called Unit 11.  No one knows what they were working on, but now all of these men are starting to disappear again.  Giant flying robots seek out the scientists as well as machinery and raw products, but no one knows what for.<br /><br />Sky Captain gets called in.  His mercenary band quickly assembles and gets ready to probe into the mystery, but they're attacked first and Sky's right hand man and innovative thinker, Dex, is capture.  But not before leaving a clue that tells Sky Captain where the source of the mysterious robots is broadcasting his commands.<br /><br />The movie quickly becomes a chase as Sky Captain and Polly track down one clue after the other to figure out what's going on.  This is familiar fare for anyone who's seen the Indiana Jones movies or the Buck Rogers serials released on DVD.<br /><br />The CG work for the movie is absolutely amazing, though the opening 30 minutes or so are really too dark in my opinion.  They seem drenched in warm sepia tones that I found distracting.  The actions sequences came along regularly enough, but most of them were far too predictable.  The most inexcusable part, though, is the lack of interesting heroes.  They were paper thin and tended to meander through scenes without substance.<br /><br />Still, as a Blu-ray release, it's an interesting one worth picking up.  The high-def presentation is fantastic, and the audio is well sorted out to get the most from your surround sound system.  There aren't any other enticements to pick up the movie if you already own it on DVD other than the presentation.picking up.

B000JK8OYU|3.0|This album is a great overview of Beatles music from start to finish.  The remix of the songs sets a good tempo where each song flows well into each other.  Overall though, I don't think these remixes are anything groundbreaking. While they are a good change from regular Beatles music, they're not anything radically different.  Good album, but not a must-have.  I'd give this 3.5 stars if I could.
B00011RPB0|1.0|Lost in Translation--the whole movie must have been lost in translation for me. The first thing I said to my husband at the end of the movie was, \\"Did we get a defective DVD?\\" Because I saw none of the intelligent dialogue that everyone raved about.  <br /> <br />I should say that, as a stay at home mom of three young children, I don't exactly require the wit of the Algonquin Round Table to entertain me. But even still, I found Lost in Translation's occasional attempts at witty repartee and observations about life trite and flat. This is like a very long, very bad Seinfeld episode--a movie about nothing, but without the humor, either. Or much of a dialogue at all, for that matter. Or even a plot. I struggled to keep awake for Lost in Translation, and I wasn't even tired when we started watching it. The *only* scene in the entire movie I enjoyed was where Bill Murray was filming the commercial with a Japanese director who speaks no English. \\"Are you *sure* that's all he said?\\" Hilarious. The rest of the movie was a crushing bore. <br /> <br />I felt no affinity with, or affection for, the characters. They were self-pitying, self-absorbed people who could find nothing better to do in the fascinating city of Tokyo than to hang out in hotel bars and the occasional club with someone else's spouse and have boring, sporadic conversations about nothing in particular. Every other character in the movie is dismally one-dimensional, and the portrayal of the Japanese people in it comes dangerously close to racial stereotyping. I was offended for the Japanese, and I'm not Asian. I thought at first my Japanease sister in law from Tokyo might enjoy seeing the movie, but after watching it, the racism was blatant enough that I would've been embarassed to recommend it to her.  <br /> <br />Lost in Translation was about as interesting, funny and exciting as overhearing someone else's cell phone conversation about the most mundane minutiae of their life. I'd rather watch a two hour Teletubbies marathon than sit through Lost in Translation again. <br />
0670813028|5.0|Having been a keen King reader in my teenage and early adult years, I have had the opportunity to read many of this fine writer's works.  While I can't agree with Harold Bloom's dismissal of his work as mediocre for the most part, not every one of King's works is a masterpiece, but It comes the closest to being one.   <br /> <br />King's novels lack the scope and scariness of some of the great classical horror writers such as Bram Stoker, Poe and H.P. Lovecraft.  However sometimes King manages to combine several elements in just the right way to create a very dark and scary world inhabited by believable and interesting characters.  The Green Mile, It and Pet Semetary are good attempts, but It really stands out for several reasons.   <br /> <br />The first is that in It the evil monster (which apparently seems to be an alien being from another universe) manifests itself as a sinister green clown.  While the monster transforms into other forms (including horror movie creatues and a giant spider like that in the Lord of the Rings) the clown is a particularly frightening symbol because in the book, the monster preys on children.  In this book King masterfully explores several common childhood fears and turns them into a tangible prescence of evil and darkness which haunts the lives of all the main characters, as well as a manevolent force which preys on the inner sins and darkness in the souls and psyches of the main characters.   <br /> <br />While the novel is very long, this is one of King's novels where the pace of the horror is allowed to build up smoothly to its majestic and terrifying climax.  There is no simple cop out or deus ex machina for the heroes in this character, and some meet a very unpleasant death.  One never gets the sense of redundant characters or plot devices.   <br /> <br />The third strength is the evil being in this novel is quite believable.  While many horror writers and film-makers tend to trivialise evil by often going way over the top in terms of violence and gore, the evil being in King's novel works mainly by deception and stealth.  The insidious and creeping nature of its evil and the slowness and rationality at which it unfolds its evil makes it so much the more believable, and also more credible as a symbol of one of life's deepest mysteries.  The strength of It does not diminish and fluctuate and rather its end comes about through its arrogance rather than through weakness.   <br /> <br />Overall King manages to bring all these elements together and execute them in a finely crafted novel which is very hard to put down.  In my view it remains his best attempt at horror fiction.
B0000009SF|5.0|You enjoy jazz do you? You enjoy the funk that gets you moving out off of your refurbished leather sofa? Zappa delivers the goods on this release. He explores so many time signatures, counterpoint structures, and harmonic relationships that it may be hard to grasp the first time around. Despite it's complicated nature, it sure is a pleasure to subject one's ears to this piece of history. Throughout this composition, Frank has somehow used dissonance as melodic companion. What else is there to say about this album, it lays the foundation for anyone wanting to explore avant-garde jazz fusion.
B000002NC4|5.0|All I have to say is if you give this album six listen throughs, you'll be done for. The first time I put this in a didn't care for it, but I had loved, \\"What's Wrong with Love\\" and I had heard this was an amazing album, so I kept at it. By the 3rd listen I knew something was up, something way beyond the surface. What at first just seemd liked a mass of loud guitars fell apart into a deep, rich, melodic symphony of gigantic porportions. By the time I got to listen number 6 I was done for. Now I can't get this album out of the CD player. Where with other albums I seem to be able to wear them out after a number of listens, this one just won't go away. This is an album with a very large complex number of layers. Get it now!
0618551050|5.0|Lee Smolin is a very deep thinker and original physics theorist, ready if needs be, to question cherished assumptions. One is humbled at how fertile his mind is and how he is familiar with the ideas and the research of so many people    The book is mainly an account of his misgivings about string theory, where he initially states, as he sees it, the five big problems in physics. In this context, he makes the very important point that since the end of the 1970's there has not been a single breakthrough in our understanding of elementary particle physics and, in particular, he claims string theory does not achieve such a breakthrough.     In making his case against string theory he discusses what string theory has given and shows how it appeared to offer a solution to some of the problems of theoretical physics. But then he builds up his case against the theory. He says that string theory does not reproduce the standard model, probably the most successful theory in physics, but even predicts particles not seen in nature. It did not predict and does not cater for dark energy, nor does it make new precise and falsifiable predictions. In particular he says string theory does not offer a solution to the foundational problems of quantum mechanics.  He also notes that here is no complete formulation for string theory. He shows though how the five versions of string theory could be unified if membranes rather than strings were assumed, but notes that this theory, M theory, still remains a tantalizing conjecture. He says hopes for a unique string theory have receded.    This reviewer would not dare to comment on his assertions but will say that any he makes, are based on a very thorough knowledge of modern theoretical physics and merit the full consideration and respect of the reader. Indeed, new ideas are needed in physics as Lee Smolin says. We are missing something big. There is a feeling though, that we are on the verge of that big breakthrough - that something just beyond our understanding at the moment will surface through the `murk' into our consciousness and revolutionize our knowledge of nature. The clues are there. To do this, Lee rightly says that the sort of people who see through universal assumptions and ask new questions are needed. He also says that progress sometimes requires deep philosophical thinking but sometimes does not. And whether it is `lateral' thinking or a leap forward in `conceptual' thinking, new thinking is definitely required. Lee concludes his book saying that what he intends to do is just that. He chooses to start with a paper of his on the relationship between quantum and thermal fluctuation. A good choice perhaps.     I strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in physics and the current problems and mysteries in the area to immediately buy this book, if they have not already done so. Even if the reader does not agree with Lee's contentions, every endeavour warrants a moment of reflection and introspection, and Lee is choosing a good time to do that for string theory. The book is still worth reading from that perspective alone, but having an open mind is the essence of scientific thought, and Lee's arguments deserve just that.
B0000024RQ|5.0|So I'm not that old but this album brings me back to my youth. I can't describe it but evertime I listen to this I feel this amazing calm and peace, like you know, everything will be alright, that the human race isn't so bad, like the sun is shining, like even though it may be cold outside I still feel warm. I'm not some Bob Dylan expert or anything like that. I just really like this album of his and don't know many other albums that put me in such a sound state of mind as this one does. If you're looking for a little piece of mind, this seems like a pretty good place to start.
0670033375|4.0|The author uses the history of civilization to extrapolate the potential impacts to civilizations in the future.  Incredible history book (with good illustrative examples) of common traits to civilizations that have collapsed - and those that have thrived.<br /><br />It does read like a history book - and is a bit long.  But - if you enjoy reading about history - you will definately enjoy this book.
B0006SNK9E|5.0|For a few reasons, Sweet could never emulate their chart success in the U.K. and Europe in the U.S.  Part of the problem was that the singles and LPs that were released in the U.K. and Europe were not released in the same format in the States, or sometimes not at all.  In the U.S., the Desolation Boulevard LP on Capitol was actually taken from two 1974 RCA releases, the first of which was Sweet Fanny Adams and the second of which was the original Desolation Boulevard.  Much of Sweet Fanny Adams was recorded in late 1973 and then released in early 1974.  Desolation (RCA) was recorded in 1974 and released toward the end of the year.  In the U.S., the Capitol version of Desolation Boulevard was released in 1975 and included half of the tracks from the two RCA albums, plus the single \\"Ballroom Blitz\\" which was not on either RCA LP but is a bonus track on the Sweet F.A. CD.  Some of the other RCA tracks were issued as B-sides of Capitol singles but many other tracks were not issued at all.  In my view, releasing this material in 1975 in the U.S. hindered success of the band as the two 1974 LPs represented the band at its peak.  By the time \\"Give Us A Wink\\" was released in 1976 (at last in the same format on both sides of the Atlantic) disco had taken hold in the U.S. and the group was marginalized as hard rock/glam.  Not even the 1978 success of \\"Love Is Like Oxygen\\" could help as the line-up that held for eight years would finally fracture the following year.  Finally, the 2005 re-releases of Sweet Fanny Adams and Desolation Boulevard on BMG-Sony make previous renditions obselete.  The mastering is first rate and the selection of bonus tracks is superb.

B000JJS8TM|5.0|I've been a Beatles fan as long as I can remember music, and, after hearing these songs hundreds of times before, the most incredible thing to me is how fresh and new these remixes sound.  Having seen the show before buying the disc today, I probably understand a bit better why some of the tracks are structured as they are (the long pauses in \\"Because\\" are there for a theatrical reason, for example), but I think this disc stands on its own quite nicely without the listener needing to be familiar with the show.  I have to admit, though, that the one thing \\"Love\\" makes me yearn for is a proper remastering/remixing of the entire Beatles catalog; if these tracks can sound this good here, there's no reason they can't sound every bit as good in their original incarnations.  However, as someone who feared I might struggle with someone - even if the someones are George and Giles (not Nigel) Martin - tinkering with the hallowed Beatles tracks, I can say that I am more than dazzled by the end result.  Buy it now, play it as loud as possible, and revel anew in the music of the greatest band ever.
0393061310|5.0|Although this book is a bit long to read - the writer has done an excellent job at writing about the history and development of civilizations.  Educated as an engineer and not having been a history \\"buff\\" in high school or college, I found much of what was presented as fascinating.  I recommend it highly to better understand the impacts that guns, germs and steel had on the development of modern day civilization.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|This new remixes disc is probably the first great 21st century stoner album. My friend and I made it a big production Monday night. We put on the album in the dark and lay there. Within the first thirty seconds of \\"Because\\" I was in tears. \\"Because the world is round\\" had morphed into the airiest chant. Leave it to the Beatles and their surviving team to come up with a remixes album that is spacey and extremely psychedelic. This was a fantastic idea and I couldn't think of anyone better to have done it than Martin and his son. This album is yet another reason why the Beatles are the best and coolest band ever.<br /><br />There are so many gorgeous moments. \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" was amazing. Many, many highlights that I'll revisit. All the segues were brilliantly done by the Martins. One thing I wonder about the mixing...it seems that when \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" comes on and you hear the Hollywood Bowl live in the back...I feel like they almost made the shrieking too loud on purpose to put you in the middle of Beatlemania. Is it me or does that part seem over the top with how loud it is in comparison to the rest of the album's mix? It'd be pretty clever I'd say! \\"Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is absolutely unreal. There are so many great moments. The new intro to \\"Lucy In the Sky\\" is so trippy! \\"Octopus's Garden\\" is fantastic. So many moments.<br /><br />I haven't heard the stereo version yet, but the 5.1 version is definitely worth it. There is so much space and the sound is so perfect. It was almost Beatles overload to hear them so clear and defined and with so much space flowing throughout the tracks.<br /><br />This is a great day for a Beatles fan.

0451191153|5.0|Anyn Rand is simply a great writer, and you will not be able to forget this story / book.  The education and development of a couple of architects is used as the basis for demonstrating the impact of being \\"true to ones values\\" versus \\"going with popular demand\\".  I feel it is probably the most profound book that I have read, and will go out of my way to read more written by Ayn Rand.<br /><br />A warning is that the book gets slow at times due to the length of the book - but overall it deserves the highest possible rating!
B000HT386M|4.0|I admit this movie isn't completely original or realistic. but it has its moments where it's really funny, there is a lesson to the film and it builds in such that's better then most of the cheesy films made like it. Adam Sandler is fine, though not overly funny in this role. but I liked the concept of being able to control what's around him! it makes it interesting! plus, the ending has a bit of a twist that makes up for the darkness to the film. Christopher Walken gives another solid performance and yet again, gives the heroine something to think about! I admit, at certain points, it gets too dark for its own good but overall, I say it's a worth catching!

Then he wrote the Life of Pi! An incredible book based on true events. I remained incredulous throughout the book because it seemed so far fetched, but I'm glad I held out and finished it, because it all made perfect sense in the end.

B000IMV4IW|4.0|So I've been driving around this afternoon, grooving to the sounds of Oasis.  For me this collection is a good way to listen to their music, since I've been a borderline fan who liked many of their songs but never enjoyed any of their entire CDs all the way through.  So having a lot of good stuff all on one 2-CD set is something I appreciate.  Listening to these songs, I was struck again by how the lads really ROCKED OUT on occasion (ex., \\"Acquiesce\\").  I've heard all these tunes before, but with this particular batch in this order, it often hit me with a cool, heavy 'T Rex meets Sex Pistols' vibe.  (The original Beatles comparisons were left in the dust.)  While I did find these discs to be a good run-through of Oasis material, there were a few dead spots.  I know it's sacrilege to the band's faithful hordes to criticize any of these songs, but \\"The Masterplan\\" and \\"Supersonic\\" felt especially clunky to me.  Fortunately there are many more great cuts to balance those out.<br /><br />I can understand the complaints from other customers about the relative scarcity of material on this set - 18 songs, 86 minutes over 2 CDs.  However, keeping in mind Stop the Clocks is single-CD priced, it's not a bad deal.  Also, I was grateful that at least ONE song in particular was left OFF of this set -- \\"All Around The World,\\" which has been ruined by having the chorus played endlessly on a phone company's current ad campaign.
B000GFLE86|3.0|In 2004 Madeleine Peyroux released \\"Careless Love,\\" a moody, slow-burning jazz/blues record that managed to sell well despite remaining under the radar. Every moment of it breathed passion, class and the ultimate in musicianship, and critics recognized the eerie similarity of her vocals to those of Lady Day. It is thus all the more disappointing that her highly anticipated follow-up, \\"Half the Perfect World,\\" is so aptly titled.<br /><br />What made \\"Careless Love\\" so brilliant was its eclectic song selection, understated charisma and warm, intricate atmosphere, and \\"Half the Perfect World\\" lacks all of these qualities. Rather than follow suit, it instead sounds like a product made with a specific audience in mind.<br /><br />Forgettable moments slant toward the original material, including a trio of songs Peyroux co-wrote with Jesse Harris, heralded for his Grammy-winning work with Norah Jones. It's difficult to fathom how two accomplished musicians could strike such a bland key. The worst offender of the originals, however, is the ghastly \\"It's All Right,\\" a non-Harris selection. Overflowing with embarrassing lyrics and sonic clich&eacute;s, how it lived to see a day outside recording studio walls is beyond wonderment.<br /><br />Elsewhere, her choice of covers doesn't work. Whereas previous choices from the likes of Bob Dylan and Elliot Smith were staggering, Tom Waits' \\"(Looking For) the Heart of Saturday Night\\" does not suit her at all. Charlie Chaplin's \\"Smile,\\" a gorgeous classic, is also unengaging, while her reading of \\"The Summer Wind\\" breezes away with a sweet yet pedestrian air.<br /><br />\\"Blue Alert\\" and the title track, both by Leonard Cohen and jazz musician Anjani Thomas, work slightly better. The lilting, samba-infused \\"Half the Perfect World\\" has a delightfully classy saxophone solo, while the former finds Peyroux in a sultry state despite awkward rhymes. Indeed, if she were to suddenly blurt, \\"her name is Gert/oh, blue alert\\" it would not sound out of place. Both tracks originate from Thomas' latest LP.<br /><br />Still, her enchanting take on Fred Neil's \\"Everybody's Talkin',\\" is a saving grace. Her vocals stir with yearning and resolute melancholy, transforming the song into her own kind of lullaby. It is the only track worthy of her last album, and cannot afford to be missed<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Half the Perfect World\\" is a disappointment. It is no easy task to follow up a classic without stumbling a bit, but this album is average at best - and Peyroux has set the bar too high to put out anything average.

B000GPIPD8|3.0|Magic Potion starts out with a bang-the rickety, punishing \\"Just Got To Be\\" really impressed me, enough that I thought I knew I was going to love this album. Not so. I'm afraid it begins to peter out and become quite repetitive and uninspiring as it drags on for another 40 minutes. Not worth a buy, but not terrible music. <br /> <br />For those of you who are wondering what this sounds like, think White Stripes plays Bad Company. In fact, the whole thing sounds like a Bad Company album with the bass and some shiny, radio friendly production stripped out. If that does it for you, buy away!
B000JJS8TM|4.0|Love was created by Beatles producer George Martin and his son Nigel in collaboration with Cirque du Soleil for a Las Vegas stage show.  It is being called a Beatles mash-up album, but it is a little different from your usual mash-ups.  Unlike the infamous Grey Album which mixed Beatles music with Jay-Z vocals, everything here is from the Beatles themselves. Also, many of the songs are true mash-ups, but rather they have snippets of other songs tacked on near the end of the track. None of the song combinations are truly startling or revolutionary. That being said, the DVD audio version's sound is simply amazing.  The songs leap out of the speakers with a new clarity that makes for a new listening experience to songs you've probably heard a hundred times each.  This makes one hope that they will release the complete Beatles catalog in 5.1 surround sound.

0767903862|1.0|I read Bill Bryson's \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book, and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated (for the \\"educated\\" aspect, Bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents).    I started into \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" with similar expectations, and especially since I have always longed and planned to visit Australia.  To state that I was disappointed is a severe understatement.  After reading this book I now have little to no desire to visit the \\"land down under;\\" my only hope is that I will completely forget what I read in Bryson's book so that I may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting Australia.  (Senility be merciful and consume me hastily!)    My best estimate is that Bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about Australia.  During and / or after his trip, his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own.  I have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as I did with this one.  Bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a \\"story\\" relayed second-hand from one of the Australians he \\"met.\\"  Such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books.    The only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents.  These, at least, provided for some interesting reading.    After comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of Bryson's books (\\"I'm A Stranger Here Myself\\") after she read \\"A Walk in the Woods,\\" it would appear that \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" is not the only snore-fest that Bryson has churned out.  Perhaps he isn't a \\"one hit wonder,\\" but I for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out.    So, if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that Bryson provided in \\"A Walk in the Woods,\\" look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed.
B000JJRIO8|3.0|Why oh Why does his work have to be altered to include people he never met yet his true friends are removed.
B000JJRIO8|3.0|The pickings are clearly getting slimmer with every release.  This is at best a collection of Makaveli B-sides and incomplete tracks (missing a verse or chorus on the original).    The best track is the only track that wasn't altered from 2Pac's original recording - \\"As Soon As I Get Home\\".   The rest are a mixed bag filled with guest appearances, which make it sound more like a tribute album than a collection of unreleased material.  Once again, there are multiple remixes of tracks on the album.  So in this case, what you really get is 10 unique tracks.  Due to the quality of some of the original recordings 2Pac's voice at times sounds distant or scratchy.  Several tracks have completely ridiculous beats, yet other beats approach those that may have been used on All Eyez On Me.    The first impression of this album is not good.  There is no flow to speak of.  Even a hardcore fan might have a hard time trying to like this album like I did.  Maybe it's time to release the best of the rest, rather than sprinkle a few decent songs in on every album...

I felt that Green Day had their masterpiece with American Idiot.  When all the tracks are perfect.  No bad songs to skip over and when the band just seems to be in perfect unison.  This is that CD for MCR.  And its remarkable for such a young band.  Maybe it's too soon for it even.  But it's out there and there is no turning back now.  This CD is excellent.  Yes you feel so many influences, but all good ones in my book!  This might be hard to follow up on, that will be the toughest part for this band.  How do you top this?  If you haven't experienced this CD, please do.  All these positive reviews must mean something!  I have it on at home, in the car and while working on my computer.  Which was how I felt about American Idiot.  Bravo MCR for making music that means so much to so many.  Thanks for your hard work.  Now start an American tour already!!!!!

B000JK8OYU|5.0|Start burning your incense and fire up the lava lamp.  This is as trippy as it gets.  For those who think the Beatles catalog is sacrosanct and shouldn't be messed with, consider the following.  Practically the entirety of Sgt Pepper was made by stitching disparate things together, as was \\"Love.\\"  Bits of Revolver and Magical Mystery Tour were done the same way.  Side Two (for those of you who remember vinyl) of Abbey Road was a bunch of songs stitched together to make a medley. The original Strawberry Fields Forever, as we all grew up with, was for all intents and purposes a patch job.  It was made from two different takes, recorded at different tempos, and in different keys, yet John wanted George Martin to put the bits he liked of each together to make a song, which of course he did.  The version presented here was put together from more than two sources, but it works brilliantly, as does the rest of this disc.  The Beatles were all about experimentation, and this disc shouldn't be treated any differently.  A must buy for any Beatles fan.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Pixar has proven its animation metal a few times. FINDING NEMO and THE INCREDIBLES are their most notable achievements, pulling off excellent scripts mixed with fun animation and great star-power voices.<br /><br />But the one thing that animation studios (including Pixar) have trouble with is displaying human beings within their animation. Many times they look plastic or stilted. The Incredibles avoided this by harkening back to animations-of-ol' but applying new styles. Finding Nemo didn't have many human faces so it wasn't such a hurdle. With CARS, Pixar did something very wise: they didn't show a single human face. Personalities were under the hood (so to speak) of the automobiles which juxtaposed nicely with their humanity.<br /><br />The story follows a cocky up-and-coming race car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson, WEDDING CRASHERS) who's triple tie win forces a showdown in California where the three would-be winners will face off. Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton, FIRST DAUGHTER) and The King (racing icon Richard Petty) are the other two contestants and they make it to California without any problems. They are ready to win \\"The Piston Cup.\\" But Lightning's driver Mack (John Ratzenberger, CHEERS TV series) falls asleep on the road and Lightning slides out the back (also while asleep) while on \\"the highway.\\" Lightning soon wakes up and tries to find Mack, but stumbles upon a one-cylinder town along abandoned Route 66 called Radiator Springs. Unfortunately, Lightning also tears up the town's road and must do his civic duty by pulling the paving machine for the length of the city. Stuck without any resources, Lightning grudgingly does the job, but not before learning to slow his rpm's and smell the proverbial roses. He meets up with Radiator Spring's city attorney Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt, MONSTERS, INC.), a sexy little Porsche model whom he finds himself oddly attracted to. There's also Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, THE STING) the town's physician/judge who harbors a big secret; Ramone (Cheech Marin, TIN CUP), a low-riding, paint-shop owner; Luigi (Tony Shalhoub, GALAXY QUEST), a tire store proprietor with a love of Italian cars; and, of course, Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), the rusted out but trustworthy tow truck who adds the most hilarity to the film.<br /><br />Cars gushes with family friendly messages but no one should hold that against it. Animation features, by their very nature, are directed toward younger audiences and allowing that innocence to come out in Cars is pulled off well without becoming achingly super-sweet. But we've also learned that adults enjoy these movies and Cars does an admirable job of entertaining them, too. Most kids probably won't know what cow-tipping is, so might not understand the slow natured tractors that double as cattle and are tipped over by Mater and Lightning. But adults with experience in this area will probably laugh themselves silly.<br /><br />That there are no human faces in Cars also aided it immensely. Suspending disbelief was easy and will allow kids and parents alike a great ride throughout.bors a big secret; Ramone (Cheech Marin, TIN CUP), a low-riding, paint-shop owner; Luigi (Tony Shalhoub, GALAXY QUEST), a tire store proprietor with a love of Italian cars; and, of course, Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), the rusted out but trustworthy tow truck who adds the most hilarity to the film. <br /> <br />Cars gushes with family friendly messages but no one should hold that against it.

El While my guitar... con un arreglo de cuerda de Sir George es quizás el tema que más me ha emocionado, dejar a un lado el renombrado trabajo guitarrístico de Clapton en esta maravillosa canción  no hace sino encumbrar más aún el genio de George Harrison; tampoco faltan Something y Here comes the sun que brillan con luz propia.

B000002KHB|5.0|Ahh, Machine Head! I remember when this came out. I bought the cassette, and within 4 years had literally played it to shreds. Then I bought another cassette. It was one of the first cd's I ever bought, but the first cd was pretty poor sound quality. I found a German cd at a used record store, and the sound quality was excellent. Then, there was the 25th anniversary cd, which was top notch, too. All in all, I figure Deep Purple owes me a gold record for the amount of money I've spent on Machine Head. And it's been worth every penny. <br /> <br />\\"Highway Star\\" is a great way to start an album Awesome. All of the songs are great here. \\"Smoke On The Water\\" and \\"Space Truckin'\\" are the popular ones, but I've always been partial to \\"Maybe I'm A Leo.\\" <br /> <br />This is one awesome album.

There's also a bonus track on this disc, \\"Take It Off\\".<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned 2 additional bonus tracks for the Millenium Concert sold at Best Buy. Looks like someone goofed. The Best Buy site does say that \\"2000 Man\\" and \\"God of Thunder\\" should be included according to the sticker on the packaging and their own website, but many fans are reporting that they are missing from the set. Whoops!<br /><br />Anyway, the big add in for this set, The Millenium Concert from New Years Eve 1999, is a pretty cool addition to the Kiss discography, but the truth of the matter is that this has been largely re-recorded in studio, some even say up to 100% re-done. Most Kiss fans know that this is nothing new for Kiss Alive albums, but in a way it detracts from the luster of the classic lineup in a new Alive album when you think that Ace and Peter probably werent involved with the re-recorded parts.<br /><br />Also, its a bit disappointing that the Alive 4: Symphony collection wasnt included. Its an official Alive album and this is an Alive Boxed Set, so on the surface it would make sense.<br /><br />In any case, this is a pretty good collection for any Kiss fan, a must have for collectors. I'd recommend picking it up if you can get it for a fair price. I saw it advertised for $20 on sale and thats more than fair for this set even with the flaws. I think Alive 1 alone goes for nearly $20.
B00004YWAG|5.0|That is essentially the 'theme' of the CD. Thus it is not all 'Spanish' music per se but a collection including some old chestnuts from other lands. All that said, it is a superb collection and even the old chestnuts have new life breathed into them given the masterful treatment dished out here. The theme of 'Mille Regretz' appears over and over and we learn, read the notes!, that is is connected personally with Carlos V. Almost a personal theme from a 16th C. soundtrack as it were. A delightful recording.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|This movie is just a copy of the first one in terms of plot and action scenes and like any copy it is not as good as the original.
B000I5X81K|5.0|This CD is amazing!!!!  It still has a lot of the rich orchestration and sounds that made him famous such as in `Mai', `L'ultima Notte' `Un Giorno per Noi' and `Un Dia Llegara'.  His voice is even better than ever, just as pure and beautiful, but he now explores more of his lower register along with his beautiful falsetto and really shows us his amazing vocal range.  But Josh Groban is not just one of the best male singers in our generation, he is also an all around musician and he shows it even more in this album.  He co-wrote 5 songs in the album and he co-produced 3, he also played both the piano and drums on the studio recording for several of the tracks. He is also exploring his musical heart and who he is as an artist.  Josh's taste in music is very varied, mimicking the musical taste of a lot of his fans (including me, I love rock, alternative, hip hop and even tango and classical music) and who he is as an artist is showing more than it ever has, evident in the songs he co-wrote, `February Song' (breathtaking and even haunting, one of my favorites in the album), `Now or Never' (simple vocals and a different arrangement away from orchestra, but you definitely feel his emotion on this song), `Machine' (an awesome mixture of jazz and almost funk that is incredibly well complemented by his amazing voice!! Also one of my favorites) and Awake (wow, this track is just feelings in a bottle!!).  Lullaby, another one he co-wrote complements `Weeping'.  `Weeping' is not only beautiful, but the addition of Ladysmith Black Mambazo makes it even more poignant especially if you know the history of the song.  I heard that Josh Groban himself heard on his last trip to South African and immediately wanted to record it. The song was written by a South African soldier about Apartheid and it's about moving forward from that dark period and make sure it never happens again.  It's just beautiful.  The diversity of sounds in this album in also incredible...you can definitely tell his growth as a person and as an artist in this album.  Bravo!!!  Just wonderful!!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|An amazing (re)work of art by Sir George Martin & Son and, of course, The Beatles.
1594200823|4.0|There has to be a better way.    Michael Pollan's book, \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\", poses two big questions: The role of corn in American food and its implications for our health, and whether it is possible to be a moral carnivore.  Both of these questions are important, and deserving of our consideration.  And Michael Pollan is clearly a writer of talent, perhaps even of immense talent.  He is a wordsmith of exception.  All of this should make for a good, perhaps even great, book.   Unfortunately, Mr. Pollan and his editors seem to be forgotten or ignored one word they should have retained throughout: Concision.  This book, at over 400 pages, is at least twice as long as it needs to be.  Often the reader is enthralled by the point, then the prose, and then wondering when it will all end, as it continues rolling off the page, each phrase spun and respun.  The admiration turns to ennui and frustration, as one repetition succeeds another.  One cannot get over the feeling that there is something obsessive at work here, perhaps even pathological, a malady impelling the author to regurgitate endlessly.  When, finally, it does all end, you wonder why - why here, and whether it was all worth it.     And, this is all unfortunate, and unnecessary, as there are passages, numerous passages, where you are left feeling that here is a great talent at work, and a guy I would like to know, with a rich sense of humor and a broad (if sometimes shallow) background, able to connect strikingly this with that.     Incontestably, American food is a disaster that has already happened, but that is also in the process of creating another, far greater.  Mr. Pollan makes clear that the origins are imbedded in the capitalist dynamic.  Or, he seems to make this clear, as he also has a long, very long, even hugely long, exposition of another idea, from Joel Salatin and his farm, Polyface - that it is precisely governmental regulation that gets in the way of fixing all this.  So, what is it: GeorgeNaylor, the corn grower, a victim of capitalism run riot, or Joel Salatin, a victim of capitalism not permitted to run riot?  We are, most unfortunately, never treated to an answer - nor, for that matter, even to a clear proposal of the question.  Ergo, no real attempt at a solution.  If Mr. Pollan has addressed his issues as matters of serious import - and I am sure he has - then it seems to me he owes his readers (who have struggled, keep in mind, through mind boggling details on his meals) at least a suggestion of an answer.     Shifting gears to the micro-scale, there are also problems that arise in the reading that seem a product of too facile an intellect at work.  Here is considerable knowledge in the hands of a masterful, if often flatulent, writer, who writes much too much, and much too fast, the ideas running riot - there is that word again - unregulated by clear, cold, analysis.  One example: on page 45 he states that it takes ¼ to 1/3 of a gallon of oil to grow a bushel of corn (but, unfortunately, on the very next page he states that it is ½!), and on page 116 you can make 2.5 gallons of ethanol from a bushel of corn.  What is not given is what the equivalency is between ethanol and oil, so it not possible for the reader to determine whether growing corn for running cars is actually a net saving of energy (needless to say, this issue is not even broached by the author, tho he dances around it so enticingly closely!).  Again, on page 148 we find the English Agriculture Ministry is promoting new fertilizers in 1943, while just a few pages previously we were told that these same `new fertilizers' were pushed in the US after that war as a way to utilize the suddenly otherwise useless production of explosives, in particular ammonium nitrate (Tim McVeigh's weapon of choice).  One cannot be reconciled with the other, so one of these stories has to be false, or distorted.  Yet another: The author becomes so enthralled with Sir Albert Howard that he fails to see a patent absurdity (fundamentally undermining the entire credibility of this source).  He quotes the man thus: \\"Mother earth never attempts to farm without live stock; she always raises mixed crops; great pains are taken to preserve the soil and to prevent erosion.\\"  One wonders whether Mr. Pollan has ever visited the Grand Canyon.   I cannot refrain from one last minor note: People's Park was not created in the way the author envisions, as some sort of idealistic new organic food plot, but rather as a provocation by a group of radicals hoping to produce that over-reaction - from the university, and ultimately from the numbskull governor - that, in fact, resulted, which was admitted later by the organizers.  Parenthetically, I know - I was there.   There are others, but enough already, lest I fall into the same disease as Mr. Pollan.   It seems such a waste that the exposition of such import given by this talented author is so unwieldy.    (PS: For those who want to view the inside of a slaughter house - something Mr. Pollan was unable to do - try to find Frederick Wiseman's \\"Meat\\", an incredible film for TV, with no narration, produced in 1976 and 'archived', somewhere, likely by the Meat Packers Association.)
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I must admit I was very disapointed when I saw this movie. The BBC tv-series is so much better. So I wouldn't bother with the movie but buy the tv-series instead!
B000JK8OYU|4.0|I am going to have a lot of my friends and fellow Beatles fans angry at me for calling Martin the \\"5th Beatle.\\"  But I need to stand by what I believe.  All in all, this is simply a great mix of some favorite Beatles songs with beautiful undertones and hints of random takes.  The way the Martins crafted the album is stunning.  The transitions are beautiful and blend songs that you would think had no similarities.  It is my recommendation that you sit down with a good pair of headphones and listen to it from cover to cover trying to pick out the subtle hints of other songs and random outtakes.  It is truly an experience.  I could not give it 5 stars because it is not truly a Beatles album but I would say it is 4.7 stars.  Well done boys!
B000008GSA|3.0|This album by Billy Idol was released in 1990.  The great \\"Cradle of Love\\" was one of his biggest hits, peaking at #2 on the Hot 100.  A pretty good cover version of the Doors \\"L.A. Woman\\" was also released as a single, peaking at #52.  Other than those two songs, the album is pretty forgettable.  Not bad, just not especially memorable.
B000HA4WT8|2.0|I learned quite a few interesting things about life from this movie.  This movie seemed to have quite a lot of plot holes.  Anyway, here is what I learnt about the world from this movie -  <br /> <br />1) The yakuza (they play the bad guys in this movie) have nothing better to do than race cars. <br /> <br />2) If you are a car racer, you will never have to do jail time for any crimes you commit.  <br /> <br />3) If you cannot drive at top speed and make hairpin turns through a car park without crashing into something, you are a loser. <br /> <br />4) Only gorgeous girls and guys with perfect bodies can drift. <br /> <br />5) Everyone in the school is either rich, gorgeous or a gangster. <br /> <br />6) It is perfectly okay to offer your car to a total stranger in a race - just to see what he's made of. <br /> <br />7) Even if you get in a race containing three cars and drive at top speed through a full city, and end up killing someone, then the police will do nothing about it. <br /> <br />8) If you are beautiful and blonde, it is a good idea to offer yourself up as the prize for a race, so your boyfriend gets involved in a race with another guy and almost kills all three of you. <br /> <br />9) It is an even better idea to scream at your boyfriend that he doesn't love you when he is neck-and-neck with another car, so that he rams into the other car on purpose. <br /> <br />10) If you walk away from a fight, you are a loser. <br /> <br />
B0000CDLA7|4.0|this is the heaviest album they ever did and in my opinion the best one. its solid and has that balance of both heavy and melodic. my only beef is the song \\"vacant\\". its short and out of place on this album. this for diehard DT fans though, as this definately different than the old stuff.
B00005JNS0|5.0|i bought this movie for my two year old, because he loves nascar races, but he would rather watch the incredibles, valiant and monsters, inc.  the ten year is the one it appeals to the most.  the storyline is geared to his age more.  In general, the animation is wonderful, but it is more for older children than it is for the tots in your house.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|The UPS man rang the doorbell.  I ran upstairs and ripped open the package.  I put the CD in my player and hit play ---- Ahhhhh.... <br />This album does not disappoint.  It is full of wonderful surprises that make the mind dance and the soul sing.  George and son have done an excellent job.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|this album is proof that jonathan davis has run out of good ideas. every song on here sucks and this album is just an abortion for your ears. they artwork is the now unoriginal kiddy themed artwork they always seem to do(korn, follow the leader, life is peachy, and untouchables all had kids in the artwork). i would suggest j.davis quit his bitching and play something good for a friggin change. nu metal...pssssshhh
1594200823|5.0|Omnivore's dilemma is an absolutely essential addition to the library of  any person who is concerned about his diet.  The book details in engrossing narrative, the author's exploration of the myriad ways in which food-fast and slow- can endanger one's health.  Most of us don't think of the animal that was hideously abused to produce that  roast chicken or steak that we are about to attack.    Every person needs this background tour and should be informed of the grim reality that underlies our diet
B000002AHM|5.0|I have been a guitar fanatic for years! Most of the usual rock/blues/classical guitarists will come to the minds of most \\"in the know\\" music fans out there!  (Satriani, EVH, VAI, Robben Ford, Holdsworth, Malsteem,...etc). <br /> <br />Then, a friend gave me somewhat of a smug smile as I mentioned the above names and mentioned \\"Friday Night in San Francisco\\".  <br /> <br />I bought it for just 800yen(I live in Japan), and was absolutely floored. <br />Period.  I cannot imagine a more talented group of guitar players than this trio.  From the first song to the last(all 5 of them), these men exhibit true guitar brilliance and technical mastery.   <br /> <br />With every listen, I constantly ask myself this:  \\"How long have these men played the instrument?  And did they practice every waking hour?\\" <br /> <br />5 STARS!!!!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!   <br />(Those egotistical rock-stars, and their guitar-god egos, must bow their head to this album.  Period.)
B000I5X80G|5.0|There are many recorded live versions of these songs available.  Unfortunately, few of them are interesting in and of themselves, i.e. beyond the value of the original recorded versions on the albums however great they may be.  Enter \\"Live at the Filmore East\\" and suddenly we can hear such Neil Young classics such as \\"Everyone Knows this is Nowhere,\\"  \\"Down by the River,\\" and most significantly and excellently, \\"Cowgirl in the Sand.\\"  There is also a life performance of \\"Wondering,\\"  a song which would not appear on a Neil Young record until 1986.  Suddenly these songs have a new shade of feeling, of musicianship, of performance, and of course, greatness.  The year was 1970 and I can only conjure that for Neil Young and Crazy Horse the songs were new and fresh and still immediately meaningful for them to perform.  As if they were breaking new ground in their own development as people, as performers, as musicians, and as songwriters/arrangers. <br />One need not be a completest to thoroughly enjoy and appreciate this CD.  Anyone who loves these songs will find new ways to appreciate and love them by listening to this CD.  The performance/arrangements recorded on this CD are exceptional, unique, and absolutely great.
B00005NG9Z|5.0|This DVD looks and sounds spectacular...The remastering job they did is short of amazing, my surround sound system gets a work out, it's crystal clear, and alot of nice bass.<br /><br />Alice in Chains to me are considered Heavy Rock, I noticed people want to put them in the \\"Grunge\\" catergory, but for me they just were a Heavy Rock/Metal band...and one of my favorites. If you like AIC then you need this DVD in your collection.
032147404X|4.0|I thought this book covered a lot of very good tips for beginner and intermediate photographers. It was written in a clear, easy to understand format. The only thing about the book I didn't like was his attempt to be humerous. I thought at times he would go on far too long trying to be funny, when comedy just isn't his forte. But this would be a good book for any aspiring photographer.
B00005JMJG|3.0|Having seen Kaufman's \\"Adaptation\\" and \\"Being John Malkovich\\", I naturally thought \\"Eternal Sunshine..\\" would be great. It turned out to be your average blah art movie. The premise of \\"Eternal Sunshine..\\"--what if you could erase unwanted memories?--is unique.  But it came off as juvenile to apply this to the romantic relationship depicted by Kate Winslett and Jim Carrey.  The characters seemed shallow and self-absorbed, and there was hardly any chemistry between them. (That would be fine, except the filmmakers appeared to take them completely seriously, trying to force their supposed charisma down your throat.)  Unlike Kaufman's other movies, there was no poking fun at anyone.  By the middle of the film I didn't care what happened to them.

B000IU3Y3W|5.0|Why do some people try to analyze what songs Neil decides to play. Just enjoy an excellent CD. For the ones who don't think Crazy Horse is a good band, listen to their first album. It would be a hit today on alternative country stations. Danny Whitten was a very good song writer, and his songs have been recorded by Three Dog Night, Rod Stewart, and The Indigo Girls to name a few. There is not a bad song on this CD. If you don't like C'mon Baby it's probably because you never had the man shine his light in your eyes. Keep these great releases coming!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|George Martin, now old enough to be Paul's other grandfather, gets the last laugh.  First of all, like everybody else, I'm knocked out by the clarity of the re-mastering.  Surely this will put a ton of pressure on those stodgy old fogeys at apple to get their butts in gear and get this precious body of music into the pristine shape that it deserves.  It also seems a shame not to put old George on the case immediately.  Like he's only the greatest pop producer of all time and knows the ins and outs of the material like no one else could dream to.    It took me sometime to catch on to some of the logic behind some of the sequencing.  The disc begins with Because, because that is the very last item the group recorded together before disbanding.  The second track, Get Back, which reflected Paul's desire that the band get back to their old ambitious comradary, is the last live piece they performed.     John was ecstatic about his \\"discovery\\" of backwards vocals (originally on Rain), so George makes it a point to feature a little backward John as the lead into Something.    Old George doesn't feature much of their early work, and in fact barely focuses on what many consider their best period, the year covering mid '65 to mid '66.  He seemed to try to cram a number of bits into Drive My Car (Paul's Taxman solo, the Word, etc.) to cover this.  So if this CD (and/or Beatles 1) is the extent of your current collection, the acquisition of Revolver and Rubber Soul is your best next step.    George also seems to settle a little bit of a score with John, who famously complained the Strawberry Fields didn't turn out as he originally intended, despite it being probably the best pop production ever recorded.  So George manages to redo the thing in a manner that included John's original input, as well as the original group instrumentation, and still throws in enough of his own scoring to make the thing rootsier and still true to the original finished production.  (Maybe a little toomuch stuff tacked on the end, but that's quibbling.)  Pretty neat.    Appyling the dynamic beat of Tomorrow Never Knows into the wise, but formerly static Within You is genuinely inspired.  It also adds to the high percentage of psychedelia in this collection which is not a bad thing.    John, who was disappointed at the lack of regard for Across the Universe responded to Paul's winning choice for a single, Lady Madonna with the aggressive, but similarly constructed Hey Bulldog, so it's very satisfying to hear the two combined.    A number of critics have complained that George's Guitar Gently Weeps was superior in its earlier, acoustic rendition, and the arrangement that Martin adds to the original is classy, if not as astounding as what he did for Walrus back when (but then again, its hard to think of any arrangement that comes close to those heights.)    There are clever bits of combination abouding throughout, and some truly sterling reproductions of a couple of the Beatle's best.  (Funny, even after #1 and this, the surface of what comprises the best is still only scratched.  A Beatles #2 featuring Saw her Standing There, Twist and Shout, I'll Be Back, No Reply, I've Just Seen a Face, In My Life, For No One, Rain, Across the Universe, etc. might still be a superior mix.)    Of course, the unfair thing here is that considering the quality of the material and the intense nostalgia that the boomers have for it, there's a lot going for this kind of project whether the actual execution is worthy, which it really is, if not quite as daring as the Danger Mouse exercise (though I'd have to say the Beatles manage to hold up pretty well without the rap).  One interesting thing is that the album ends with the same Christmas tape line ('good night to yuz all\\") as did the Residents Beatles mash-up from 1977:  Beyond the Valley of a Day in the Life.  How much you want to bet that George wasn't aware of that early piece of sampling?    Ultimately it's about the music, which remains fresh, intriguing and begging for attention.  I've got a feeling that this will sell very well and only spur on continued interest.  Thanks George, for the holiday treat.
B000ICLHIE|5.0|Where do I start? Despite the general strength of Tom's more recent work for Anti, still we have not heard material quite this sharp or focused since Bone Machine or perhaps Mule Variations. The \\"Brawlers\\" CD alone is worth the price of this entire set of outtakes, dense with one riotous stomp after another and brimming over with the kind of biting lyrical turns that are characteristic of Waits's superior ability as a songwriter.<br /><br /> Some of the work here may be familiar to committed fans: the brilliant \\"Walk Away\\" appeared on the \\"Dead Man Walking\\" sounstrack, while \\"Books of Moses\\" is a cover of a Skip Spence tune from a tribute album to that doomed legend of Moby Grape and Jefferson Airplane fame. Similarly, other performances here surfaced on the Liberty Heights Soundtrack, an album of Jack Kerouac rants, and a benefit CD for the infamous case of \\"The Memphis Three,\\" but this set rocks even without those great numbers.<br /><br />Waits is at the top of every game he's ever played here--some of the ballads here among the finest he's ever done, with the gorgeous \\"Long Walk Home\\" and \\"Shiny Things\\" leading the pack, but the bones 'n holler sound he mastered on Bone Machine and Real Gone emerges in full bloom here as well on instantly addictive thrashers like \\"Ain't Goin' Down to the Well,\\" the bitingly political \\"Road to Peace\\" or his rollicking cover of Jack Kerouack's song \\"On the Road,\\" a tune on which he receives a little help from Primus.<br /><br />In recent years, fans have been treated to sprawling sets of outtakes by some of the most recognized artists around, such as Dylan, Springsteen, The Cure and Pearl Jam, but this Waits set outdoes all of them combined. This is a truly amazing testament to a talent whose boundlessness even his most devoted fans may not have fully recognized until now.<br /><br />Visit my blog at [...]

B000JJRIO8|3.0|Iam a huge Pac fan he is the greatest ever to speak in the Mic. <br />As expected this was almost a duplicate to Loyal to the game.  <br />Pac does not have one song by himself it is like this is Pac's Duets with rappers and Instrumentals that he would never rhyme with or on. <br />There are only a few people that belong on this cd collaborating with Pac that is as follows : Bone Thugs, Big Syke,Yaki Kadafi, Edi, Young Noble, Hussein Fatal does a good job on his parts in this though and Papoose, as a Pac fan those are the only ones I would except to stay on this cd.  <br />What is up I'll tell you if there are any previous release for Pac you better expect the following  <br /> <br />1. Instrumentals he wouldnt rhyme with <br />2. Rappers who he wouldnt even speak of <br />3. Another Mixtape  <br />4. More Distorted , slow down his voice tracks <br />5. More Dissapointment <br /> <br /> <br />This cd is for the new wave people not the true Pac fans, this cd is  <br />for people who have never listened to Pac, so they are throwing on these wack rappers on the cd, so you new age kids who dont know what a real rapper sounds like, will listen or buy this cd. Message to those producers for the last 2 Pac cd's The only ones that bought Pac cd's where his true fans not the new age. The new age is about Southern and G-unit crap.  Thats what the new age buys they arent going to buy this. You need to come out with a Pac album for the Pac fans and leave only Outlawz and people affiliated with Pac when he was alive to contribute to the albums.  The problem with this album and the last is that The New Age doesnt care nor respect the greatest who ever done it Pac. They prollay think that Lloyd Banks and 50 and dipset are better rappers then him and they wont pay attention to Pac's cd's being released. <br />Overall I would say Iam disguisted and of course Dissapointed althought it is exactly what I expected it to be so its my own fault. <br />Only buy this cd if you are a true Pac fan and need some new material to listen to from him That is one of the only highlights fo the cd that all his verses are unreleased.  <br /> Other from a couple of tracks on this cd I would say that there isnt anything great about it my favorite tracks would be  : track1 Untouchable Swizz Beats Remix with Bone Thugz also a instrumental I just cant see Pac rhyming on  track 3 DUMPIN feat. Hussein Fatal, Papoose, and Carl Thomas Track 9 SOON AS I GET HOME This is probably the best track on the cd especially because this sounds like a Pac beat something that he would actually rhyme off of.  Track 11 DON'T STOP good point in this track and I quote \\"WHY YOU THINKIN NAS SCREAMIN HIP HOPS DEACESED\\" that was the illest thing anyone who contributed to this album spit on this cd.  <br />Pac fans again only buy it if your a true Pac fan <br />You little new generation southern crunk crap music there is there fair share of southern rappers on this release thats the way this industry is going south get it <br /> <br />R.I.P. 2PAC SKAKUR \\"OUTLAW IMMORTAL\\" \\"MAKAVELI THE DON\\" <br />
B000E1YVZU|2.0|In terms of both format and style - and despite its superficially modernist tendencies - \\"Rent\\" has its roots firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition.  Yet, it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production - which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters.  In more traditional musicals, the long stretches of spoken exposition between song-and-dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable, flesh-and-blood human beings.  This is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like \\"Phantom of the Opera,\\" which seems a natural for this type of approach, but with material like \\"Rent,\\" which is small in scale and intimate in scope, the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience.  I know that this play (and, perhaps now, even the movie) has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers \\"Rent\\" practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism, but to someone, like myself, coming cold to the work, \\"Rent\\" adds up to much less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />The story, a modern day update of \\"La Boheme\\" set in Greenwich Village, starts on Christmas Eve, 1989, and ends on Christmas Eve, 1990.  This was at the height of the AIDS epidemic, and, indeed, many of the film's characters - primarily gay men and former junkies - are struggling with the disease (AIDS being the modern equivalent of the consumption used in the original story).  There's also a wheezy subplot involving a real estate company that wants to evict the starving artists (one is tempted to call them \\"deadbeats\\") from a building in order to further their diabolical scheme of re-developing a city block.<br /><br />\\"Rent\\" - with its noble \\"performance artists\\" doing battle against the Big Bad Corporate Bullies - feels less like a relic from the `80's than one from the `60's.  Though intended to be the heroes of the piece, the artists and bohemians often come across as naïve, painfully self-absorbed, and annoyingly self-righteous, an attitude epitomized by one of the characters rigging a local ATM machine so that his buddies can withdraw unlimited amounts of money from it using his dead boyfriend's name (the heavily allegorical \\"Angel\\") as the password (this is somehow supposed to be seen as admirable and a tribute to the spirit of the dead man).  Anything`s better than actually working, I suppose, and becoming a tool of corporate America.  When one of the men finally takes a dreaded \\"job\\" ( a mere sinecure, I might add) so that he can actually pay the rent he owes (horrors!), he acts as if he is selling his soul to Satan, and has to have two of his lady friends accompany him to the interview for moral support and to offer him assurances that he will still be able to live with himself even after he has soiled his hands with the dirty mammon from an honest-to-God paycheck.  I wonder why it never occurs to any of these characters that the capitalist system they loathe so deeply is also helping to produce drugs that will one day lead to a possible cure for the disease that afflicts them.<br /><br />With the exception of newcomer Rosario Dawson, the filmmakers have retained most of the original Broadway cast members for the movie, and even though their acting isn't all that impressive, some of them do very well indeed at singing and dancing.  In his direction, Chris Columbus has broken away from the confines of the original production, but he never manages to bring us into the world of the people we're watching.  Despite the constantly tracking - sometimes even spinning - camera he has chosen to employ, the film still feels stagy, over-stylized and artificial in almost every scene.<br /><br />As to the libretto by the late Jonathon Larsen, only one tune strikes me as truly memorable, while the rest all sound like repetitive musical doodling.  One of the problems, too, with having so much of the conversation sung rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so utilitarian, pedestrian and prosaic - when they aren't pseudo-intellectual drivel on the order of \\"the opposite of war isn't peace; it's creation\\" - that they become unintentionally funny when set to music.  It's not for nothing that the Sharks and the Jets didn't actually sing out most of their confrontations.<br /><br />There are, admittedly, some very moving passages in the last half hour of the film as the disease finally begins taking its grim toll on several of the characters, but those moments of quality are completely undercut by one of the silliest copout endings I have ever seen in a motion picture.  In that one crucial moment, the movie descends to the level of low comedy and farce, taking any pretensions to seriousness right down the drain with it.<br /><br />I don`t question for a moment the basic humanity and sincerity of the people responsible for \\"Rent\\" (or of its many devoted followers), but it`s hard to get too worked up over a story whose premise seems to be that people - especially \\"sensitive\\" artists - should be allowed to live on other people`s properties for free.much of the conversation sung rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so utilitarian, pedestrian and prosaic - when they aren't pseudo-intellectual drivel on the order of \\"the opposite of war isn't peace; it's creation\\" - that they become unintentionally funny when set to music.

B0000C1733|5.0|No, it's not in chronological order. Yes, it totally ignores everything before BSSM (except for 89's \\"Higher Ground\\"). Yes, it has too much emphasis of BSSM and Californication. Yes, it doesn't even give us the best track off One Hot Minute (\\"Aeroplane\\"). Those misgivings, however, still don't compel me to give this collection anything less than 5 stars.  <br /> <br />First off, it does a fine job at giving newbies a glimpse of the band's peak works. BSSM, Californication and By the Way all get a decent amount of representation. This is whence the public's favourite tracks stem from, so naturally, they get a big emphasis. All the big hits are here, so this gives people a chance to snatch them all at once without having to dish out 15 bucks per album just to get a few famous songs. <br /> <br />Second, it gives fans 2 new songs. These are quite enjoyable, if I might add. In addition, it also gives fans access to the non-album track \\"Soul To Squeeze.\\" This is a good inclusion, but is it necessary? Oh well. They could've also given us the Chili Peppers' cover of \\"Rollercoaster of Love\\" from the Beavis and Butthead film. <br /> <br />Now, some might fret about not getting a complete overview of the band's career. But really, why should this set be charged with such a responsibility? The earlier \\"What Hits?!\\" compilation does a good job at culling (generally) the best material from the band's patchy 80s albums. This one sticks to the better-known tracks from their better-know epoch. <br /> <br />All in all, if you don't own a RHCP album and you like a bunch of their songs, start with this. Sure, it'll get you hooked on the band and their work and you'll probably end up buying all their stuff later anyhow. But hey, at least you'll have some neat non-album tracks with you in the end :D
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Look all you whiners: <br /> <br />if you want bring me to life or my immortal, PUT FALLEN IN AND LISTEN TO IT! if you want ben moody then go track him down and ask him to make some songs for you. <br /> <br />With that said i waited anxiously for this album. obviously i knew it wasnt going to be the same as fallen...read opening comment above. And i knew it wasnt going to be on the same level. Upon buying it and listening the first time, my exact words were 'man this album is crap' <br /> <br />then i gave it another listen. and another. <br /> <br />and now im hooked. <br /> <br />naysayers say whatever you want, thats your 1st ammendment, but try not to defile it with your bias just because you dont like it or it doesnt live up to your expectations or 'its not as pop as fallen' <br /> <br />if you want every track to be a masterpeice that you will follow blindly till your death then go write your own stuff! see how you do. <br /> <br />maybe then you will respect the time and hard work they put into their music and wouldnt bash them just because it doesnt suit your every little need or whim. state so and go listen to something else, dont poison other peoples opinions before they decide to buy the album. words arent meaningless they have effects even if subtle. <br /> <br />now, im just going to say what i feel about this album in my unbiased opinion. <br />Sweet sacrifice- The song i would have picked to open up the album. I personally love the lyrics to this song (who cares who its about, music is meant for personal interpretaion) and i like the guitar rhythms. <br /> <br />Call me when youre sober- Not a bad song, i like the theme,love the last part of the song 'ive made up your mind' and then her giggle. bridge is kind of lacking. <br /> <br />Weight of the world- an average song in my opinion. nothing really fantastic about it, nothing shockingly lacking. <br /> <br />Lithium- I may have to add some personal bias to this right here but i believe this is the best song on the cd, if not the second best of all time behind my immortal. her voice sends chills down my spine every time i listen to this song. i relate heavy to the lyrics in my own personal way. a great song to numb any emotional pain you are feeling. <br /> <br />Cloud nine- great song, the lyrics pretty much give you the imagery of being on cloud nine. <br /> <br />Snow White Queen- Wierd song, didnt like it at first, but that was before i actually LISTENED to the song. now its the song i find most often stuck in my head. <br /> <br />Lacrymosa- I like the lyrics, but the music leaves something to be desired in my ears. not saying you wont like it, it just doesnt click with me. besides, i like beethoven better than mozart anyways. <br /> <br />Like You- This song may be about her sister, but i find it relates well to my feelings of sorrow and longing towards a pet i lost recently. probably not the greatest song to listen to if you want something sappy happy but if you are struggling with the same types of emotions as her, great song to listen to. <br /> <br />Lose Control- I like the guitars in this song, but even after trying to interprate the lyrics, i still dont feel like i know where its supposed to be going...other than cheating on someone 'if we play very quiet my love, mary never has to know' <br /> <br />The Only One- Easily the second best song on this cd IMHO the beginnning just enchants me and the chorus...amazing. who needs something catchy when you have honest brutal eloquent lyrics as this song? oh wait thats right the teenie boppers do. 'all our lives, weve been waiting, for someone to call our leader, but all your lies, im not believing, heaven shine a light down on me' and the bridge...wow...i always find myself bursting out in song when i hear it. <br /> <br />Your star- Third best on my list, didnt know what was really up with the way she draws out the word star but its different and interesting and doesnt detract from the song. 'How can thedarkness feel so wrong?' the guitar riff in this song gets stuck in my head all the time. i like the marching feeling it gives. good to bang your head to, if you are in to that kind of stuff 'why cant you feel me, calling your name? Cant break the silence, its breaking me' <br /> <br />All that im living for- Didnt like this song at first, but it grew on me. the music leaves a little bit to be desired in the beginning but the rest of the song and the lyrics make up for it. <br /> <br />Good Enough- Showcases Amy's Stupifyingly enchanting vocal talent. and its great to see a happier geared song as the closer. Amy, i cant say no to you. <br /> <br />All in all, id say its a fairly solid album, granted, it really does not compare to fallen, like apples and oranges, but a good granny smith apple is just as enjoyable as a big california navel orange. <br /> <br />so leave your expectations behind and enter the door with an open mind. I know thats hard for some people to do.
B000002UWW|4.0|These days, most people are surprised to hear that I am a Chili Peppers fan. \\"What? They're a modern band. Aren't you always saying you hate 90s and 00s bands? You're full of it,\\" they say. At that point, I have introduce them to this particular compilation. <br /> <br />What Hits!? chronicles (in a non-chronological manner) the band's efforts from 1984 to 1991. Bam! See? They were making stuff in the 80s. Now, that's not to say that this era's output was at part with the material from, say, Californication. Rather than giving us sprawling epics filled with many 'a memorable song, their early days gave birth to half-baked LPs that had both gold and dross. This collection attempts to catch the highlights from their early days. <br /> <br />First, we get two tracks from the band's extremly patchy eponymous debut. \\"Get Up and Jump\\" is a repetitive bouncy funk number played at a fast tempo. \\"True Men Don't Kill Coyotes\\" is an okay track that's totally in thrall to Andy Gill's hollow production. That first album essentially follows the templates set by these two tracks. Some are funky (but unfocused) while others are strange and suffer from really awkward production values. Overall, its good that we didn't get too much from that CD. <br /> <br />Next, we get five tracks from 1985's Freaky Styley.\\"If You Want Me to Stay\\" is a Sly Stone cover that's pure lazy funk. \\"The Brother's Cup\\" is a similar sort of treat, and the a reworked cover of The Meters' \\"Africa\\" (entitled \\"Hollywood\\") also boasts this laid-back approach. George Clinton did a fine job in disciplining and then relaxing the band's funky sensibilities. The piss-poor \\"Catholic School Girls Rule\\" is also included, though. This is the kind of senseless filler that tends to cloud the early albums. Horrible. I would've prefered more lazy funk. A track like \\"Yerte The Turtle\\" would've been perfect. <br /> <br />Then, we get 4 tracks from 1987's The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. This is my least favourite album because it melds fast and trebly guitars with rock sensibilties that collide with the slow funk of old. The end result of this crash isn't pretty.  <br /> <br />We also get a track from The Abbey Road EP. It's a cover of Hendrix's \\"Fire.\\" And yes, it is absolute garbage. <br /> <br />Next, we get 4 songs off 1989's Mother's Milk. This album sees the funk come back at double speed. It also brings Frusciante to the fore for the first time. Although he hates it now, the guitar sound here is rockin' (almost metal!) and strong (in constrast to the puny ones on the 87 album). The most famous of these tracks, \\"Higher Ground,\\" best illustrates the marvellous combianation of metal guitars with a funky rhythm section. <br /> <br />We then get a rarity off the Pretty Woman soundtrack: 1990's \\"Show Me Your Soul.\\" This could've been on Freaky Styley and that's why I love it. Very classy, funky and occassionally macabre. A winner! <br /> <br />Lastly, we conclude with a track from Blood Sugar Sex Magik (\\"Under the Bridge\\"). <br /> <br />Overall, this set does a good job at showing us the band's early days. However, by doing that, it exposes the fact that the earlier RHCP incarnations weren't the tight funk-rockers of today. This collection serves a susbtitute for their early patchy works. Those who don't feel like investing in those discs can just buy this in order to get a glimpse of the evolution that the RHCP had to go through before becoming the superstars of the 90s and 00s.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I have seen \\"Love\\" twice, and it is an incredible show. But even if you haven't seen the show, this CD is brilliant. Taking songs that are over 30 years old, and reinventing them and merging them into a whole new experience is sheer brilliance on the part of George and Gilles Martin. The sound qualit is exceptional (especially the 5.1 DVD...definitely get the 'deluxe' edition if you can). My personal favorite is Benefit for Mr Kite merging into She's So Heavy and Helter Skelter, which takes a light-hearted song and turns it into something sinister.
B00004W3L3|5.0|After reading so many comparisons between this album and the PG-era Genesis sound, I decided to try it out. Much to my pleasant surprise, those comparisons turned out to be well-founded. Imagine a logical successor to \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" produced in the 80s. Whatever your imagination cooks up will probably be quite similar to Marillion's \\"Misplaced Childhood.\\" <br /> <br />The album starts out the hauntingly beautiful \\"Pseudo-silk Kimono.\\" That tiny track is then followed by the fantastic pop-prog of \\"Kayleigh.\\" It's the poppiest track on this, and deserves a place in the pantheon of great pop tunes. <br /> <br />The pleasing \\"Lavender\\" is then followed by two multi-piece epics. Both are quite complex and are interlocked in a manner that renders them into a single track. Mind you, both sides of the LP can function as whole tracks, but these two suites are best emblematic of the \\"big song with interlocking songs\\" idea. <br /> <br />Side two is a thoroughly pleasing affair that ventures into epics and also finishes with some delightfully poppy and pleasing tracks (\\"Childhood's End\\" and \\"White Feather\\" ). Superb. <br /> <br />Overall, this disc encompasses both progressive sounds and influnces, all the while merging it with acute pop sensibilities. Wonderful. And it doesn't hurt that singer Fish sounds a lot like Peter Gabriel. <br /> <br />An absolutely indispensable addition to any prog fans collection.
B000IHYVUU|3.0|Calling this movie \\"The Doors\\" is misleading. It would be more accurate to call it \\"Jim Morrison and Those Other Guys In the Band,\\" since that is how it's presented.<br /><br />It's always tempting to latch onto a rock legend in these rock biopics, and Oliver Stone clings like a limpet to the ghost of Jim Morrison. Acid-soaked scenery and mysticism are in every scene, but Stone seems content to wallow in the rock'n'roll debauchery rather than get into Morrison's head.<br /><br />It opens with a voiceover of Jim Morrison's poetry, as we slowly fade into a stalled recording session. Then it flips back to 1949, as Morrison's family drives through the desert. The boy catches a glimpse of several Indians by the road -- and one of them dies as the family leaves.<br /><br />Then it flips ahead to Morrison's (Val Kilmer) years at college -- he crashes a party for a pretty girl, makes arty films, acid-trips, and devotes himself to poetry. Then his pal Ray Manzarek (Kyle McLachlan) creates a rock band, with Morrison's poetry and voice as the centerpiece. Soon The Doors become a fixture in L.A. -- and then a famed band.<br /><br />But as the Doors become more famous, Morrison increasingly loses himself in the messianic-Dionysian-rocker role that has been set out for him. He weds a witch-journalist (Katherine Quinlan) but loves his fey girlfriend Pamela (Meg Ryan). And when he outrages the authorities with the threat of public exposure, the spiral starts that will only lead to death.<br /><br />Stone certainly knew how to evoke the golden ages of rock'n'roll. Lots of sex, kinetic concerts, and bizarre behavior where Morrison jumps up on platforms and screams, \\"I am the Lizard King! I can do anything!\\" The whole movie just kind of sweeps you off your feet.<br /><br />And Stone is quite brilliant with the direction. The movie is filmed like an acid trip -- shifting multicoloured skies, Indian ghosts, shadows on the sand, and eerie lighting. And it touches on other aspects of the late sixties -- the Factory, Nico, and the belief that something violent and beautiful was about to erupt.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Stone seems so enamored of the atmosphere that he never quite gets around to making a biopic. The other Doors are relegated to a frame for Morrison's bizarre behavior, and after the first half hour, they basically fade away. And he gets too enamored of his own style with the Indian ghost, and the arty \\"dead man\\" final scenes.<br /><br />Val Kilmer does a shockingly good job with the languid, unpredictable energy of Morrison. He sings well too. Sadly, his performance is stuck in a one-note character -- Stone opts to potray him just as a random, sleazy, wild jerk, and we don't get a single insight into his thoughts. Sure, Morrison could be horrible. But this is Jim Morrison as rock cliche, not as a human being.<br /><br />And sadly, none of the other actors get much chance to expand on their roles -- the other Doors actors, including MacLachlan, basically play slightly annoyed accessories, and Meg Ryan plays a sweet girl without many other dimensions. Although Crispin Glover has a tiny, memorable role as Andy Warhol.<br /><br />\\"The Doors\\" opens into a beautiful psychedelic movie, but Stone fails to give it a soul. It's a fun biopic full of the sixties atmosphere, but it never quite manages to be much more.er aspects of the late sixties -- the Factory, Nico, and the belief that something violent and beautiful was about to erupt.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Stone seems so enamored of the atmosphere that he never quite gets around to making a biopic.

B00005M989|3.0|Most casual listeners will be familiar with the majority of tracks on the first two thirds of the album. Why? Because these are masterpieces of the pop rock genre, laden with innuendo and superb structuring. Alright, good.    But the last third of this compilation is a load of bollocks. These are some of the most dire tracks I've heard. Why on Earth are they rubbing shoulders with \\"Raspberry Beret\\" or \\"When Doves Cry\\"? After the vivid commentary on \\"Sign 'o The Times,\\" the quality of the tracks plummeted. Some tracks feature raps whose inclusion is unwarranted and obtrusive. Others are unremarkable. And some would be more tolerable if they weren't on a compilation titled \\"The VERY BEST of Prince.\\"    If you just want the biggest hits, then you might want to buy this. It's in chronological order and gives you most of what the casual fan might want. Alas, it also tags some absolute failures onto the end of the disc. If you just assume that the collection ends with \\"Sign 'o The Times,\\" the disc becomes way more tolerable. But then you'll say to yourself \\"Geez, they could've given me more tracks.\\" And indeed, they could've given you some prime stuff from his peak years. But they don't.
