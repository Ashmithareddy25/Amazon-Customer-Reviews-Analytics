B000AP04FG|4.0|This is a highly entertaining movie - the 2 hours at the cinema just flew away. On the movie, Brad Pitt and Anglina Jolie looked cool, intelligent and made for each other. The music score was as exciting as the action quickenened the heartbeat. The director(Bourne Identity) succeeded to maintain the pace and tension throughout the movie. He was clever to make full use of Angelina's strengths - determined look and physical prowess built in Lara Croft movies. Brad Pitt had excellent lines and a big heart.    What makes this movie better than other summer blockbusters is the focus on the romance part and the attention to fine details in the script - well-written dialogues, timely gags, looks exchanged. There is chemistry between Brad and Angelina.     The best scene was when Mr. and Mrs. Smith, both professional killers for different companies, were at the dinner table figuring out whether the other one was the rival player and how much the other knew already. At the same time, they were wary of all sorts of potential dangers - sharp words, knives, poison, guns, car chase etc.  Watch for the crucial moment when Brad Pitt gave a final test to Angelina and she fell for it. From then on, they were at each other's throat and their relationship changed drastically - only for the better as their love for each other was rekindled.     Differences between men and women were implicated in the movie. Consider how Mr. and Mrs. Smith work, Jane's sorority vs John's pair, how Jane outsmarted John in the search of the house. Not to mention the head count between Jane and John. The marriage counsel meeting at the beginning and at the end of the movie was a delightful twist.     A movie with excellent lines, laughs and action. I walked out of the cinema with anticpations greatly exceeded. Love to watch it again.
B00005JNZ4|4.0|Super cute movie. Laughed alot. Love Lane and Cusack both. Charming story. Great everything music, plot, acting. And unlike another reviewer said you dant have to be old or divorced to appreciate this. There were alot of teens in the theater laughing hard. The only downfall was it did start to drag just a little in the middle.
B000002KIE|5.0|This is one of the greatest old school punk rock records ever.  Some of the lyrics are a little too \\"dirty\\" but the beat is amazing!I can't live without this album.Literally, this record as shaped the way punk is today.If Johnny Rotten,Steve Jones,and Paul Cook hadn't tried to put this record out on the market (Sid Vicious didn't help them record Never Mind the Bollocks...), God only knows how punk would be today!
B0009KA7BS|5.0|My husband and I don't see a lot of movies and have no patience for below average ones.  (We are known to walk out of many, last one being the last Star Wars movie - what is it with Lucas, they've been getting cheesier and cheesier).  We both felt that this movie was one of the best devil movies we've seen.  Loved the story, and you know good overcomes evil, yeah... but you never really see the end coming, never have expectations for what happens.  I love that in a movie, it's really hard to achieve.  Having had no experience with the comic led me to have no unrealistic expectations with the movie.  I saw this movie in the theaters and when on a plane and given the option to see it again saw it a second time.  I eventually want to purchase this one too.  Really, as far as acting it was well done, as far as special effects, excellent.  These types of devil movies can be cheesy and stupid, but this one rose above the norm.  If you saw that other devil movie-- Keanu, Charlize Theron  <br /> and Al Pacino (the name escapes me) and liked it, you'll definely like this one.
B00004W52U|5.0|As Comic Book Guy would say: \\"Best ska-punk record ever!\\" <br />The whole damn album is wonderful!A classic!It's perfect in every way!My fave song is \\"Knowledge.\\" The lyrics are great and the beat is totally awsome.Honestly, Operation Ivy is way better than Rancid is and ever was!Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman should've stayed with Operation Ivy.And Tim made a huge mistake by joining the Transplants!But I recamend that you buy this.It's perfect for you if your a huge ska fan.
B0008G2IRO|5.0|'Demon Days' is a wonderful concept record, beautifully conceived and produced. This is what Marilyn Manson's 'Mechanical Animals' might have sounded like, had it been a post-modern jazz/blues/hip-hop affair. There is a similar sense of detachment from the world... the lo-fi soundscapes evoke that same sense of floating in space, while watching the seemingly pointless drama of the world unfold beneath you. The first two thirds of the record, with tracks like 'Feel Good, Inc.', 'Kids with Guns', and 'O Green world' take you through a dystopian land-of-tomorrow style slideshow of sensory overload and amorality. The panorama reaches a crescendo with the intense dance-floor numbers 'White Light' and 'DARE'... but the dancers feel more like zombies- dead things motivated solely by the pounding of drums, rather than by any essential humanity. It is a singularly disturbing daydream. Surreality finally overtakes the narrative with the spoken word apocalypse that is 'Fire Coming out of a Monkey's Head,' before sinking into the warmer blues and greys of  'Don't Get Lost in Heaven' and 'Demon Days'. The end result is like watching a vision of heaven, while coming down off of bad medicine and strong drink. Highly recommended.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|There is perhaps no more appropriate totem for the world of punk rock than the cover of \\"London Calling\\", a perfect aping of Elvis Presley's first album - including the same pink and green font scheme - only featuring Paul Simenon smashing his bass on stage as opposed to Elvis strumming his guitar and singing placidly (at least by comparison).  There is also no greater example of a band whose sophomore album was universally panned by comparison with it's era-defining debut, only to come back and put something out which would silence the critics (including finicky fans) forever - or at least until the solo careers kicked in.    \\"London Calling\\" manages the rare feat of being everything to everyone; there are an almost maniacal variety of musical genres been played off of here, and not a single one is brought off in anything less than triumphant fashion.  Whereas the Clash had toyed with reggae in a more reverent fashion on their first album, with \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\" they fully realize how punk and reggae can blend rather than simply co-exist.  \\"London Calling\\" is stark and anthemic, with it's prophecy that civilization as we know it is experiencing a revolution, a sentiment no more cleverly illustrated than in the line \\"phone Beatlemania/has bitten the dust\\".  \\"Hateful\\" is another catchy hybrid-pop tune with sociological lyrics, a hallmark of this album if there is one.    The band reach a new peak with \\"Spanish Bombs\\", a song that is propellant in rhythm while still being built on minor chords, a paeon to the Spanish Civil War which reaches it's richest symbolism in the line \\"my Senorita's rose was nipped in the bud\\".  Horns make their way into \\"The Right Profile\\" as they both mock and salute the tragic life of Montgomery Clift, and the 80s focus on consumerism is given precognitive analysis in \\"Lost in the Supermarket\\".  My favorite song on the album is probably \\"The Card Cheat\\".  Over swelling piano and horns, Joe Strummer illustrates the plight of the man who seeks heroism in inauspicious times.  Moving from a man looking to succeed his adversaries in the Wild West maelstrom of saloon gambling to less metaphorical examples such as those who have fought unjust wars for incompetent kings, Strummer urges \\"before you met your fate, but sure you did not foresake/your lover...\\".  \\"Clampdown\\" is another pop song typical of the album's style, a vaguely Caribbean influenced number with politically charged lyrics, this one dealing with the purposelessness of willful admission into the rat race in no uncertain Marxist terms.      And of course everyone knows \\"Train in Vain\\", although it was a late addition to the album and wasn't even listed on the record sleeve, hence providing an early example of the \\"bonus track\\" (in fact, even the original CD issue failed to list it, although the reissue campaign of the early 2000s finally fixed this issue --- personally I thought it was a lot more fun when you just had to know it was there).      Altogether, not only are there no weak tracks on this album, but with \\"London Calling\\" the Clash fused punk and more popular strains of rock 'n' roll in a unique way that no one has ever been able to replicate, including the band themselves (follup LP \\"Sandinista\\" would be heavily criticized for exactly that:  attempting to match the eclecticism of it's predecessor while both overreaching and underachieving at the same time).  When I hear people argue over who's the greatest rock band of all time, it invariably comes down to a choice between the Beatles, the Stones, Led Zeppelin, or some other band of that classic rock ilk.  With \\"London Calling\\" the cornerstone of their legacy, I don't see any reason why the Clash can't be considered just as relevant and timeless as any of those bands, and this album proves you don't have to like raw, dirty, two chord punk rock snottiness to appreciate what the Clash have to offer.
0375815260|5.0|I as many others know the story through the Gene Wilder movie.  I remember as kid watching it with my family.  It was one of the moments were you thought there was no real evil in the world.<br /><br />With the new movie I decided to read the original to see if there are any claims of the movie character taking a little from Michael Jackson.  Kind of sad to say there might be some truth to this as I found Wonka to be kind of a Phileas Fogg type of character.<br /><br />The original move stayed the course of the book but there was some artistic license.<br /><br />The book tells the story from Charlies viewpoint.  Charlie is poor.  He lives with his family.  Both grandparents included in a tiny shack of a house.  With all the poverty Charlie retains the pure innocence of a child.  He wishes for more but is is about improving his family rather then simply himself.<br /><br />His opportunity arrives with the announcement of the golden tickets.  As to the movie, he finds money on the street, buts a candy bar and gets the ticket!<br /><br />One thing that is different is the option for both parents can go versus just one like in the move.  Charlie of course picks  grandpa joe rather then mom and dad.  Dad was left out of the movie.<br /><br />Enter Willy Wonka.  I thought Gene Wilder was more to the character then Depp.  He was a gentlemen with a peter pan view of the world.  He didn't like \\"improper\\" children.<br /><br />The umpalumpas are different then the movie and their songs are rather funny.<br /><br />One thing I was surprise was the fact the glass elevator was a different book.  My book had both stories in it.<br /><br />Overall a classic tale of the good and pure getting rewarded in the end.  It is a book that all children should read.
0553573403|5.0|I quite accidentally came across \\"Game of Thrones\\" one day while browsing through Amazon.  I was shocked to see over a thousand reviews (mostly favorable) of this book that I had never heard of.  I was intrigued, although skeptical, since I usually found the fantasy genre to be sort of silly, what with its highly crafted covers and Dungeons and Dragons appeal.  I never fell into the group that was interested in that sort of thing, yet, being an open-minded person who was in search of a good fat read, I took the chance.<br /><br />Man, was I glad that I did!  It has been quite some time since I have had such an engrossing reading experience.  This book is filled with believable, likable (and despicable!) characters, and it is filled with well-thought out, multi-layered plots that will keep you interested until the last page.<br /><br />The book basically is about a land of seven kingdoms at a time in which there is political instability.  Its focus for book one is on the Stark and Lannister families and its multi-narrative point of view focuses on three different Stark members, a Lannister voice plus an additional voice from outside the kingdom.  The different narrative voices keep the pace of the story flowing, and you find yourself left wanting more as each chapter comes to a close.<br /><br />The book is filled with intrigue, mystery, humor, adventure, violence, sex, and much, much more.<br /><br />As a note, the other two books so far in the series build on this excellent debut.  Martin expands on his talents, showing a flair for exceptional characterization, and an aversion for black and white characters.  Just when you think you can determine whether a character is \\"good\\" or not, Martin throws a sucker-punch, and makes you see that people are not the binary opposites that this genre (and others) sometimes make them out to be.  The heroes are flawed, the villains have real, valid emotional sides that I found myself begrudgingly acknowledging, until, the line between hero and villain became erased commpletely, making this a saga about \\"real\\" people caught up in very turbulent times.<br /><br />As a student of \\"serious\\" literature, I admit that I scoffed at this genre without having read any of it, but George R. R. Martin's \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" Trilogy (soon to be a fourth) is as amazing a reading experience you are likely to have.  I'm just glad that I started the book when he already had three written!  I'm not sure I could have taken the wait between each installment if I had been on board from the beginning.line between hero and villain became erased commpletely, making this a saga about \\"real\\" people caught up in very turbulent times. <br /> <br />As a student of \\"serious\\" literature, I admit that I scoffed at this genre without having read any of it, but George R.

0385493622|5.0|Andrew Wiles shocked the world when he broke out of his reclusive studies at Princeton to reveal that he had solved one of the world's most notorious mathematical problems: Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT).  This theorem (or conjecture, as it had not been proved yet) has haunted mathematicians for over three centuries.  It was the last puzzle left by Fermat, who claimed he had a proof for which \\"this margin is too small to contain.\\" <br /> <br />The problem itself is simple, and any grade school child can understand it.  FLT states that whole number solutions to the equation x^n + y^n = z^n do not exist for n greater than 2.  It seemed simple at first, and all the best mathematicians in the world threw all their techniques at it without success.  Almost every mathematician you have ever heard of-Gauss, Euler, and Fourier, to name a few-have tried and knelt in submission to FLT. <br /> <br />The key to Wiles's proof is the use of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture.  This conjecture allowed Wiles to attack the problem from a different angle: if he showed the T-S conjecture to be true, he would show FLT to be true.  The T-S conjecture has to do with elliptic curves and modular forms.  Basically, the FLT equation can be rearranged to an elliptic equation that is so weird that no solutions can possibly exist if the T-S conjecture is true.  Thus, the T-S conjecture implies that FLT is true. <br /> <br />The book Fermat's Enigma, by Simon Singh, details the struggles and triumphs of Wiles's eight years of mounting a proof for FLT.  The story is written with a historical eye, revealing of bits of mathematical history whenever Wiles stands upon the shoulders of giants to further his proof.  The narrative is also gripping, and you will find yourself immersed in the realm of mathematical genius and perspiration as you read about Wiles's risky endeavor on wasting eight years proving a theorem that was possibly out of reach. <br /> <br />Even if you're not a big math fan, you will findFermat's Enigma to be well written, accessible, and exciting. <br />
0790730960|5.0|Tim Burton directed this sequal to his 89 hit Batman. Casting michael Keaton once again as the dark knight, he is pitted against two worthy adversaries - The Penguin, played disturbingly by Danny Devito, and the psychotic Catwoman, the role defined by Michelle Pfieffer. As if these two ecintric villans we'rent enough alone or combined, there is also Max Shreck(Christopher Walken) the ruthless, murderous millionair. Burton once again brings his unmatched Gothic style to the world that is Gotham City, creating beautiful establishing shots, and an atmosphere for every level, whever it be the dark, murky waters of the sewers, to the snow covered streets of Gotham, to the expensive and lavish ballroom masquerade scene. The characters build their lives basically to be plunged into a violent, psychotic play against each other, trapping villans against villans, and the plot itself is based on the firey need for revenge at any cost.To put it simply, this is one of the best sequal's of all time, and the one of the best if not THE best installments in the highly successful franchise. I would reccomend buying this film at any price.

B00005JNZ4|2.0|So my wife & I were celebrating our anniversary and thought a nice romantic comedy would hit the spot.  Well, it would have.  Unfortunately, this ain't it.  Few of the scenes work; most are horribly written and it's sad to see the on-screen talent struggle to make them work.  We kept rooting for the thing to get better, and that's what's so frustrating about a film like this; just when you think it's turned a corner, it stalls again. <br /> <br />\\"Must Love Dogs\\" is a cute enough title and the lead actors appealing enough, but it takes no time at all to encounter the first of a plethora of problems that run throughout this film.  The opening plot exposition and backstory, are the sloppiest I've seen since, perhaps, \\"Dune.\\"  Also, after 10 minutes we know how our happy ending will take shape, but that's forgivable; it's not always the destination that's interesting, but sometimes the journey.  It's unforgivable when both journey and destination are miserably executed, as they are here. <br /> <br />One of the other problems is that none of these people are interesting at all.  \\"Must Love Dogs\\" is basically a romance between animatrons, not people with any substance.  We learn in the opening scenes that the still-lovely Diane Lane plays a divorced teacher of toddlers who still can't bring herself to go on a date, and that the still-geeky Jon Cusack plays a sensitive, more recently divorced boatbuilder with a scuzzy lawyer buddy who thinks Cusack just needs to get laid.  By the end of the film we really know nothing more about either of these two, and the chemistry between them is spotty at best.  Worse, the lawyer buddy doesn't even have the redeeming quality of being likeable at all, or even funny.  He's just putrid. <br /> <br />Fortunately Christopher Plummer is around to add some desperately-needed class, although the equally talented Stockard Channing is wasted in a role that seems cribbed from Marsha Mason's sometime character on TV's \\"Frasier.\\"  She's wasted inthe role because the director of this Dog won't let her play it as brassy as Mason did; if they'd been more honest and just blatantly copycatted, it would've added some pizzazz, but they don't even have enough guts for that much. <br /> <br />We should have left early.  By the time Lane inexplicably finds herself aboard a canoe rowed by a team of college girls, apparently strangers to her, that came out of nowhere to help her chase down Cusack, we were no longer very disappointed.  The film simply never gave us enough of a chance to get our hopes very high.  Yuck.
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|I've never been a real hard core Led fan and own very few of their albums. I picked this one up because of the song \\"Shine it all around\\", I really like that song. All I can say after listening to the entire album is... THIS BOY CAN STILL ROCK. Excellent, excellent album.
B00005JNSK|4.0|I wanted to be original in this review and not talk about the classic Gene Wilder version, but I find it impossible.  Having been a big fan of that film, yet having not read the book, and being a huge fan of each member of the trio named in this review title, here are my thoughts on how this much-discussed project turned out. <br /> <br />It's a very funny film, first of all.  There are a great number of hilarious moments, lots of laughing out loud for all ages.  And the moral that was clear in Wilder's version is clear again:  Wicked children suffer the consequences of their actions and hopefully learn and grow, while goodness is rewarded in one way or another. <br /> <br />And for my money, the music is leaps and bounds better in this \\"rethink\\" version, with Elfman's score sounding more like his old Oingo Boingo sound than anything he's ever put on film.  Having been a Boingo fan myself for about a quarter century, that's saying something.  \\"The Candy Man\\" always seemed out of place to me, the only part of the Wilder film that had to be endured rather than enjoyed (other than the out-of-place super-sappy ending); Elfman has taken the lyrics that Roald Dahl wrote in his book and added his singular quirky pop-rock sensibility to them. <br /> <br />This brings me to the Oompa Loompas.  Modern technology has made it possible to duplicate Deep Roy, a Kenyan actor of Indian heritage who has worked with Burton several times before, into 165 six-inch-high Oompa Loompas.  Instead of merely carbon-copying him, however, a la \\"Lord Of the Rings\\" and \\"Troy\\" battle scenes where a few dozen actors are duplicated into thousands, multiple takes were used to convincing effect as if we were really seeing many tiny Oompa Loompas instead of Xeroxed Deep Roys.  The result is as clever as anything Burton has ever put on film, a solid improvement over the little people in the earlier film.  Roy reportedly earned a cool million for his role(s), nice work if you can get it. <br /> <br />But the heart of the comparison between the Depp Wonka and the Wilder Wonka is, of course, between Depp and Wilder.  While there's no doubt that Depp is a more versatile actor, Wilder's portrayal of the chocolatier is one of moviedom's greatest offbeat characters. <br /> <br />It is unfortunate that Depp's interpretation has come out at the same time that Michael Jackson has been such a subject of fascination, as many have drawn parallels.  I think that in a few years audiences will see this without the Jackson comparisons and be much fairer in their assessment of Depp's work here.  Depp's Wonka is the personifcation of stunted development, single-minded antisocial obsession, and paranoid as well, without being nearly as creepy as some have stated.  I find him no creepier than Wilder's Wonka, and no scarier....in fact, less so.  He's a big kid whose genius has allowed him to not grow up, and whose childhood was really ugly. <br /> <br />Thus we can see that there is a valid psychological comparison between Jackson and Depp's Wonka, but it's unfair and unwarranted to overdo this comparison; it's just a current popular culture touchstone with which some reviewers have pigeonholed Depp's version.  This will wear off over time.  Personally Depp's Wonka seems to me more like an immensely more harmless version of Malcolm McDowell's Alex from \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" at least visually; turn Alex's clothing style black and you have Depp as Wonka in \\"A Clockwork Chocolate.\\" <br /> <br />There is one criticism I can agree with.  The repeated flashbacks to Wonka's childhood, as the son of an obsessive dentist, are really distracting.  We spend the first half-hour of the film being told what a wondrous place Wonka's factory must be, being teased into wanting to see it ourselves, then once we get there we are constantly drawn back out to Wonka's childhood.  It's really unnecessary; more restraint in revealing Wonka's upbringing would have resulted in a smoother story and more satisfying experience.  One reason Burton went this way was that he could work with Christopher Lee in the role of Dr. Wonka.  Having been a huge fan of '50s and '60s horror films when he was young, this is big to Burton; see Vincent Price's role in \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" for a much more effective fulfillment of Burton's wishes to work with such actors. <br /> <br />Ultimately \\"Charlie And the Chocolate Factory\\" is an improvement over the original in a couple of ways (special effects, which is no surprise due to technological advancements; the music; the ending; and, marginally, the acting talents of the children), is the equal of the original in some ways (the set decoration, the wonders of the factory, Charlie's love of family), but inferior in some ways (primarily the flashbacks).  I prefer the original, but this newer model is well deserving of a place on my list of 200 favorite films.

B00005OWEG|5.0|I grew up with Apolcolype Now as one of the first movies in our family's home video collection in the late 1970's.  Needless to say, it was watched more than once and it really set the standard for me as I would enter into movie-going adulthood.  Few movies have matched this over the years and it is now a part of my family's home video collection(thank you Amazon.com for the free shipping feature).  I look forward to the day when my six-year old is ready to experience this movie, as I did with my dad years ago.  Notwithstanding some of the epic scenes that highlight this film, perhaps my favorite scene is the dinner brief.  This subtle work of art revolves largely around Harrison Ford; there is lots here between the lines.  Note the testy inquiry by him of Martin Sheen to see if he (Sheen) was a reliable agent of classified information, to be followed by order instructions by Ford to Sheen delivered in short-breathed, perspiring anguish, hinting of previously unsuccessful identical missions.  The redux version gives this movie a bit of a meandering quality, but does so with an \\"Easy Rider\\" feel.
B000085RTZ|5.0|As I've written only one review before on Amazon, for Sonata Arctica's \\"Reckoning Night\\", I tended to be very wordy. I'll try not to be that way here and I'll just rate the songs, with a description of what I like about them. Here goes: <br /> <br />Center of the Universe ( * * * * * ) - What a way to start off an album! Lots of keyboard and symphonic work, along with the trademark metal double-bass that is featured in over half of the songs. Nice surprise found in the female vocals in the soft middle interlude.  <br /> <br />Farewell ( * * * * * ) - Starts like \\"Center\\", but the similarities end with the general sound and pace of the song. The rhythm is more galloping and frantic, the vocals are more powerful in this song than most others, and the lyrics are more urgent yet contemplative. Has a very powerful ending, too! <br /> <br />The Edge of Paradise ( * * * * ) - Here, the vocalist turns up the grease in his voice for the verses, kinda zepp-ish and weird, but it has a very catchy chorus. Even though it has a monkish chanting in the middle interlude, this is the most commercial rock sound in the album <br /> <br />Wander ( * * * * * ) - This is a very beautiful power ballad. The singer is obviously influenced by Geoff Tate (Queensrche); if he isn't, I'd be very surprised as his voice has a big resemblance, at least in this song. Beautiful string work (or is it synths?) provide good atmosphere. <br /> <br />Descent of the Archangel ( * * * * * ) - A techno/goth beginning that immediately slams into double bass (drum) and double note (guitar) rhythmic bliss. Another catchy chorus with a sinister edge, since this is the part of the story where Mephisto first tempts the main character. <br /> <br />A Feast For the Vain ( * * * * ) - The temptation continues, with a very exotic sounding verse theme. The use of middle eastern sounds in the middle of the song is a nice touch. Not as powerful or moving as \\"Descent\\", but it gets the point across. <br /> <br />On the Coldest Winter Night ( * * * * ) - Very beautiful rhythm and lead guitar acoustic work dominate here. This ballad is not as moving as \\"Wander\\", but it  is rich in texture and provides the perfect melancholy mood for this part of the story.  <br /> <br />Lost and Damned ( * * ) - The tango-ish sounding music switching off with metal rhythms really throws me for a loop here! There's good moments in this song, but I really couldn't get into it the same as the other pieces. (I could just see myself: dancing the tango for a few seconds, then headbanging the next!) <br /> <br />The Mourning After (Carry On) ( * * * * * ) - Add an extra star to this rating, for the sheer enjoyability of this song, especially the sing along chorus!! Not only that, but the transpositioning in the chorus section brought a big smile to my face, as I rarely hear any bands attempt that. This and other little touches they integrate into the song are the reason why I got into this kind of music in the first place! [singing] Carry on, carry on... <br /> <br />III Ways to Epica ( * * * * * ) - This album starts with a powerful beginning, so here's a powerful ending to go with it! The music and vocals in the verses are simply hammering! Again we have an interesting male/female vocal duet, this time in the chorus, and it doesn't detract any from the sheer power in this song. The band pulls back a little in the bridge, then kicks it back into high gear for the rest of the song. A simply awesome finish! <br /> <br />I intentionally left \\"Helena's Theme\\", as well as the prologue and interludes, out of the main body. These extras provide some atmosphere to the story and \\"Helena's Theme\\" is a beautiful way to tell the female character's emotions in the story. This brings the overall review from 4.5 to 5 stars. I'd recommend this album to any prog/epic/power metal fan, or anyone who wants something different from the \\"nu-metal\\" that's dominating the airwaves!
B0006399FS|5.0|I was a little amazed to see some of the negative reviews of this CD by U2.  While I don't worship U2 or consider them infallible, I certainly believe that \\"Atomic Bomb\\" deserves a lot better than it has gotten from certain cynical reviewers.  I can only conclude that some people never really gave it a serious listen. <br /> <br />If you listen to the music, pay attention to the lyrics, and check out the really pure spirit behind it all, you cannot help but love this CD and admire the guts it took to make it.  It sounds as fresh and alive as anything being released by anybody today; even moreso, in my opinion.   <br /> <br />\\"Vertigo\\" is a mega radio single, but there's a lot more to this CD than just that one song. So, whether you love or hate \\"Vertigo,\\" you should still check out what's going on here, because if you do, it might blow your mind.  The second song on the CD, \\"Miracle Drug,\\" is a change of pace, more contemplative with a bubbly electronica feel.  \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own\\" is pretty breathtaking; it starts off slow and then just explodes. The dark rocker \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" may or may not be a political statement, and it's still kind of growing on me.  \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" is really uplifting and \\"All Because of You\\" will make you want to pogo up and down and pump your fists in the air.   <br /> <br />\\"Man and a Woman\\" is a more restrained, observational song that goes down pretty smooth.  \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" gets under your skin, in a good way, and \\"One Step Closer\\" is a multi-layered beaut.  \\"Original of the Species\\" has to be one of the best U2 songs in the past decade or ever; it really is a strong, personal, warm song.  And \\"Yahweh\\" is another one of those stand in your chair, wave your hands in the air kind of songs.  It's not a blazing rocker, but it has a lot of soul and it moves along very insistently. <br /> <br />How would I rate this against U2's other CDs?  Very strongly.  It shows a lot of growth, but at thesame time, it stays true to who U2 is.  I think its a natural child of \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind,\\" but its got a little bit of \\"Boy\\" in there too (all that chiming effervescence and innocent hope).  I wouldn't say it's as good as \\"The Joshua Tree,\\" but then again, what is?  But for now, it's getting a lot more spins on my CD player than anything else (maybe I should say iPod, thanks to \\"Vertigo,\\" LOL).   <br />
B000002JSN|5.0|Physical Graffiti is probably the best Led Zeppelin album. The album is packed with great songs like Kashmir, In the Light, Trampled Under Foot, Ten Years Gone, and the Wanton Song. A must-have.
B00005JNEI|2.0|I saw this when it first came out. I left the theater feeling like I had been manipulated and force-fed an ultra-liberal's agenda.    It was touted as a \\"documentary\\", yet the purpose of a documentary is to present an unbiased and neutral view of a subject illustrated with historical facts. \\"Farenhiet 9/11\\" does nothing of the sort. It's a propoganda film, full of slant.    Moore IS funny, in a way, and he did a good job with piecing together lots of footage in such a way that made The President look bad. I have to admit, I DID chuckle at a few things. But, if I were given hours of footage of Senator Kerry, in day-to-day life, I'd have had no problem at all putting him in a bad light.    I don't know what the big deal was regarding the length of time Bush spent at the school upon news of the attacks on 9/11. What was he supposed to do? Freak-out all the little kiddies and announce to them that America was under attack by terrorists and, as a result, he had to leave immediately? Not an issue.    In the end, no propoganda film was ever going to remove The President of the United States from the White House. I'm glad that not everyone was fooled.    2 stars for SOME entertainment value.

B000002UJQ|4.0|First of all, calling this the greatest album of all time is pretty silly. I mean it's really really good, and I usually like sophisticated alternative music, but in order for an album to be considered \\"the greatest of all time,\\" in my opinion it should be accessible to more than just the \\"mature,\\" or the \\"disciplined\\" listener. I think really great art ought to be universal. <br /> <br />So anyway, yeah, I really liked this album, as will most open-minded people willing to work a little at trying to enjoy it by listening to its initially boring-sounding tracks over and over again until they start to sound good. <br /> <br />Most of these songs are awesome, though the talking computer voice that interrupts occasionally is kind of annoying. <br /> <br />And I don't care what anybody says, Fitter Happier is a cool track.
B0001IN080|3.0|I bought this DVD after the last CD, which I LOVE and haven't stopped listening to since I got it, which is why I was all the more dissappointed by the horrible production in the DVD. The \\"live\\" video parts are just a horrible mesh of fade-in, fade-outs, b&w, cut to another take... enough to give you motion sickness! (and I love mtv, so its not that). the music is fantastic, but i would advice to buy a cd instead and wait for a better dvd to come out. he does come through as a pretty nice guy in the short inverview bits, but even those are with a camera thats jumping every which way in a moving car (thank god for traffic lights, at least when the car stops the camera stays still). advice to michael: stay AWAY from whoever edited this horrible thing.  <br />the live cd it comes with is not bad, though...
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|the person who you will see at the top of page two (thanks to yours truely) has a small penis, so dont listen to him.<br /><br />System of a down is MUCH different from metal/rock bands. if there is ANY band that is different i strongly suggest you buy the CD and stop listening to people with small shlongs.<br /><br />P.S. that person said something about being slaves to MTV, well, i dont even have cable, and love System of a down. so what have it? buy this CD, and the next, and so on... and so on..
0743454537|1.0|The premise of this book is excellant. Everything else is awful. I can't believe I wasted an entire afternoon reading it... I won't waste anytime repeating what other reviewers have already stated...I just wish that I could give the book 0 stars.
0552149519|3.0|In The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown has read some of the more controversial non-Christian histories regarding Jesus and the potentiality of his having sired children, etc. etc.  Unfortunately for those fundamentalists who refuse to acknowledge it, there is enough evidence out there to support at least the hypothesis that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had children.  Whether or not that bloodline survives to this day is a matter of heated conjecture, even among those who argue favorably for the hypothesis; but for those still too closed-minded to even consider it, this book will be an eye-opener and a stunner.<br /><br />For those who have an open mind, and for those who have read Angels and Demons, this book is a bit of a letdown.  If the hypothesis is a letdown, the action sequences seem pre-scripted for a movie, rather than for a book of this length.  The character of Robert Langdon is given some level of development in this book, but that is true only if one has read A&D.  If not, many of the references to Langdon's past will remain questions; but perhaps that was DB's intention (get people to read the other books).  And who can blame him?  A&D is by far the better written, more interesting, even more explosive book; to question the very foundations of the Catholic Church, even to show that, above all else, the clergy are human, with very human frailties and obsessions is to put oneself in the line of fire of the longest-serving mind-control organization in the history of humankind.<br /><br />DVC, as stated, is going to be made into a movie.  Perhaps the choice of Tom Hanks as Langdon is a weak one; but his name sells, and the fact is, Harrison Ford is already too old to play even himself convincingly any more.  So Hanks, a chameleonic actor with plenty of talent and charm, will do fine.  I hope that Jean Reno, as the police sergeant, is less of a stick figure than he has been in some of his action movies, and more like the character we saw in The Professional.  If so, he'll be wonderful; if not, then Fache will be... facile.<br /><br />In any case, this book lives up to the hype only if you're still living in the 1950's and simply don't have the intelligence or wherewithal to think broadly and for yourself about issues such as personal faith and existence of divinity.  If you subscribe to the mindlessness of unabashed faith, without any abstraction of thought or purpose, then this book will set you on fire.  If you're actually capable of questioning established dogma, you'll probably find this book relatively tame.fessional.

B00005JKNF|5.0|Gosford Park provides us with a unique view of British society in the 30's.  The characterizations are so rich that the mystery itself becomes secondary. This is a movie that can be enjoyed on many levels. You become totally enveloped in the pre-war British aristocracy; only the dinner convervations among the men give you any idea of the dangers that lie ahead.   You see American society as \\"comic\\" and portrayed by a weekend guest, a Hollywood producer from America. It is a 2-way mirror, though; he is there obstensibly to view the British on their own turf for his upcoming movie. A brief inquiry is made at the dinner table of his next film.  It is made clear that Americans are not to be taken seriously.  <br /> <br />This movie is exquisitely filmed. The acting is superb. The mystery is sublime. <br />
B00007AJF8|5.0|I already know Charlie Kaufmann wrote this, but still. I seriously think this is one of the only movies that I enjoyed enough to watch all of the credits. Great story, great cast, great soundtrack, great writing; you get the hint. Everything about this movie blew my mind.  Craig... something or another works in a cramped (to say the least) office between the 7th and 8th floor of a big corporate office building. He is a puppeteer at heart, but to make ends meet he takes this job, and loves it! He works as a filing clerk, but two factors heighten the working experience. He is smitten with his co-worker (Katherine Keener), and he discovers a trap door that leads him into the mind of celebrity John Malkovich (John Malkovich)! Holy Wow!   But what does a door into the brain of John Malkovich mean? Does Malkovich know? Is it a hallucination? Is it something else? Believe me, I really want to blurt it out, but I won't. See this movie, it's great.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|I would never have picked this up if I hadn't heard it first.  I live in the state and I wasn't even excited.  But I have to say this guy is pretty poetic and extremely talented.   <br /> <br />I am at a loss as to how to describe it.  It's like sweeping, folk, banjo, poetic...you know what?  I don't know but I like it.  It's interesting and it's catchy.  I hate to say it but the John Wayne Gacy song is astonishing in it's beauty about a subject that is so horrible. <br /> <br />
B00005YXZH|5.0|The 2001 release from Wilco is by far the best album they've done. Unlike Summer Teeth, this album is far more laid back, laxed, and a lot different. Also, the background noise is just the icing on the cake; the layered percussion in \\"War on War\\", the strange high-pitched whistling noise on \\"Reservations\\", and... more stuff like that, create a very outdoors, wilderness type atmostphere to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Oh, and Glenn Kottche's pitch-bending of his drums is friggin' cool.
B0006L16N8|4.0|So it may not be better than Rush to the head you know what, I don't care.  It's still a great cd.  It's still much better than the first cd.  It's still better than most of what is played on the radio day after day. <br /> <br />The sound has not changed since the last cd at all.  As a matter of fact these could be outtakes of that cd for all I know.  It sounds beautiful all the same.  A solid cd and worth the price.  If you like them then just do it.
B0000CNY5G|5.0|Two thieves who have been friends a long time ago, are chased and besieged in the middle of the desert. One of them decides to go for an additional horse but never returns: this is Jack (Eli Wallach) who besides escapes with two gold bags, the other is captured and confined in a prison in Sonora during five long years.<br />He can stand any longer and decides to escape with a partner; but there' s just an issue which has allowed him to bear all the jail's hell: his vengeance's thirst.<br />The exhaustive search leads him to Monterrey where his ex con has become (in an anticipated Kubrick vision' s Clockwork Orange) in the town's sheriff. Brando is not alone; he is accompanied by three gunfighters who have planned to steal the bank. So we have Jack as a distinguished law's ambassador with a clean service' page and happily married with a Mexican and her teenager daughter.<br />The script will be composed by an admirable web of  events that will make to hesitate the viewer; Who is the bad guy?; Is a sheriff 's badge the way to forget about it a twisted life just because you haven't seen them?; Does the law allow you to punish and humiliate a man under the mask of the suspicious?.<br />One of the most interesting surreptitious readings is: \\"The redemption is not precisely, a concept in the values scale of an ex con.\\"<br />Brando stars and conducted this magnificent picture, beautifully photographed and remarkably directed. The 141 min run without you realize.<br />An exceptional and brilliant film that acquired a cult dimension since its first release and still, forty four years later.
B0002858YS|4.0|I don't know what all the haters are talking about.  They have revived a sound that has been sorely missed and an era of fun.  This isn't groundbreaking but it's pretty darn good.  I like the sound and I like their entire vibe.  It does wear a little thin to listen to it straight but it's still a very good cd. <br /> <br />If you still love the 80's and you want something fresh you could do worse.  It's better than Duran Duran's new cd and that wasn't too shabby for a comeback either.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|If you watch the DVD Farewell tour, live from Melbourne, by the Eagles you won't be dissapointed. There is not much new, only a few songs like no more cloudy days. No suprises, but the peformance from the guys as Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Joe Walsh and Timothy B. Schmit are from such a high livel that it's hard to beleve you are watching a so called \\"live peformance\\". The other guys who made the band complete for this occasion are also big fun to watch and hear. The \\"mighty horns\\" are fabulous. For fans like me, I'm a fan since the 70's, and followed them ever since, it's every time a suprise to hear from them. They never broke up as a band but you never know what to espect, retirement or a project like \\"the farewell 1 tour\\". For hardcore fans like me it's a must, this DVD. Also for people who never heared of the Eagles(is that posible??)I recomend this DVD three hours good and crystal claer music and lyrics,most of it from the 20th century but put in 21th century arangement. BUY THIS DVD !!!!
B0002234LS|5.0|Johnny Depp gives yet another magical performance of Mort a struggling writer who is in the process of going through a difficult devorce. Through the movie he comes up with a perfect story, a sequal to an original book of his. He then becomes stalked by an angry fan who swears that Mort stole his copy of the book. Mort hires a secret detective to help him discover who this obsessed fan is. I don't want to give up the suprize ending so I'll leave it at that. I recommend for all Johny Depp fans!
B000069AUI|3.0|A Rush of Blood to the Head unites so many diverse groups of music listeners under one cloak of fondness.  It's not hard to see why.  The hooks are mammoth, the lyrics are sincere, and front-man Chris Martin radiates humility and a kind of non-threatening social conscience.  Coldplay adheres strictly to the Britpop formula of high jangly guitars, piano, ethereal string arrangements, and soaring vocals (see Travis, Starsailor, Keane, to name a few) but Coldplay arguably does it best, perfecting the formula to new heights of impeccability.  The problem is that great music is not just about perfection, but about depth, meaning, and personality.  For all the sincerity of Coldplay's lyrics, the sentiments they are sharing are rather generic and vague, reflecting upon sadness and romantic love (the primary themes) with nary an insight.   <br /> <br />For instance, when Chris Martin sings on \\"Green Eyes:\\" \\"Honey you are the sea/Upon which I float/And I came here to talk/I think you should know,\\" there is something unavoidably annoying about the reduction of a complicated emotion like love to such insipid sentiments.  But by the same token, \\"Green Eyes\\" also features Martin's excellent gift for melody, and the sense that, despite how generic the sentiments are, Martin still feels them sincerely.  \\"In My Place\\" has no real content or bite behind it.  \\"And yeah/How long must you wait for it?/Yeah/How long must you pay for it?\\"  Is this an expression of emotion or simply a compilation of lyrics that fit the choruses?  The best songwriters do both, but Coldplay seems to eschew the former for the latter.   <br /> <br />Lyrics aren't the only problem, though they are the most notable.  Coldplay's reliance on conventional song structures stifle any potential for roughness, fun, or musical inventiveness.  The band's musicianship (of which there are considerable amounts) exists to service the hooks, not to showcase the individuality that can exist within the group dynamic.  Even Travis, Coldplay's Britpop compatriot, features guitar solos that showcase some bite and personality.  With Coldplay, every tambourine clang, every drum thump, every high pitched guitar effect seems synchronized and homogenized toward one vision.  \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is a fitting title for the album because the album seems single-minded in its attempt to achieve that desired effect.  It succeeds smashingly, but sacrifices the uniqueness, originality, and personality that the group dynamic of rock bands can facilitate.   <br /> <br />The Coldplay backlash that began upon the release of X & Y and culminated in a truly stupid New York Times editorial must be in recognition of these weaknesses.  But a backlash seems inappropriate toward a band so inoffensive to begin with.  Granted, the perfection on this album is stifling, but it's also occasionally beautiful.  Coldplay's popularity isn't for nothing.  The band is genuinely talented at writing accessible music, and that gift has thankfully injected some much-needed tunefulness into the dead air that is corporate radio.  But music listeners have to ask themselves: is accessibility enough?
0792164903|5.0|This is the classic tale of Icobbod Crane (Johnny Depp) and his fight with the headless horseman. Crane is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow by the New York courts to find the real murderer and bring him to justice using his own inventions to detect the killer. He meats Catrina Vanhousle (Christina Ricci) who bewitches him and falls in love with.<br /><br />Crane goes to sleepy hollow and disbelieves that a headless horseman is responsible for the murders until he comes face to face (um I guess it would be more face to body) with the horseman. He overcomes his fear of religion and the unknown to find the person responsible for controlling the horseman dispite the help of this God fearing town.<br /><br />Watch as Depp and Ricci fight the horseman. The special effects in this movie are second to none, the soundtrack/musical score adds a chilling feel to the movie. A must see for all Johnny Depp/Christina Ricci fans. Or fans of Horror movies or movies with fantisic special effects.

0805076476|5.0|Like many fans of Chuck Palahniuk's book, \\"Fight Club,\\" I first saw the Brad Pitt/Edward Norton film. Also like many, I have a very difficult time distinguishing between which of the two I like better. After finishing this novel of 199 pages, which is disappointingly short in my opinion, I side with those who say that the movie and the book gave a different side of the same story. <br /> <br />Hm, ironic, isn't it? <br /> <br />Every time I'd pick up this book, I'd read and read until I shouldn't have been reading any more. It only took me four days of on-and-off reading but every time I'd put the book down, I'd walk away feeling an intense feeling of confusion, disgust, and in some cases, a slight depressing feeling. Fight Club isn't about fighting, it's not about action, and it's not about adventure. It's philisophical, it's inquisitive, it's innovative. It's a book that can change how you look at anything, especially soap and soup. <br /> <br />Fight Club immmersed me like any good book and for that, I must commend Palahniuk. I will soon be picking up \\"Lullaby\\" or \\"Choke,\\" as many Fight Club fans also checked those out. <br /> <br />If you're looking for something different or if you've seen the movie, you can't skip out on this novel.
630522577X|4.0|Although a brilliant movie, there are three problems with My Fair Lady on DVD: 1) the movie was designed to be viewed on the big screen, 2) the audio commentary is poor and 3) Audrey Hepburn.  <br /> <br />1) Cukor shot this movie as a direct adaptation from the stage, which was appropriate for theatrical release, but not for home viewing. For example, a great deal of action in this movie is conveyed via the actor's facial expressions. However, Cukor frequently includes wide-angle shots that encompass the entire set. Appropriate enough for the theatre, but a great deal is lost when viewing at home, even on a larger flat-screen monitor.  <br /> <br />2) I listened to about an hour of the audio commentary and then could bear no more. It is largely a bitching session about how difficult it was to restore the film, containing technical detail appropriate for a UCLA film school student, but not the general public.  <br /> <br />3) Audrey Hepburn was a great actor. I've seen a number of her films on the big screen at the Stanford Theatre (a wonderfully restored theatre in Palo Alto that screens the classics). However, Audrey overacts Eliza the guttersnipe and her lip sync performance is embarrassing. She nearly recovers with her Ascot performance, which is absolutely stunning and hilarious. This is Audrey at her best. However, clearly this is a role meant for Julie Andrews. Like Rex Harrison, Julie mastered this role on the stage, and she would have been absolutely perfect in the movie. <br />
1591840562|5.0|There really are two very different kinds of entrepreneurship out there - Bootstrap and VC. The strategies and tactics of each path are vastly different and entrepreneurs must decide which suits them the best.<br /><br />Art of the Start focuses primarily on the VC path and provides excellent advice for those looking to build their business by raising money from venture capitalists. It brings into sharp relief the amount of time, energy and preparation that must go into the money-raising process. Indeed, this becomes the full-time job of the founder.<br /><br />Bootstrappers can take heart, however. While most of this book does not apply to them, Chapter 5 is dedicated to the Bootstrap approach. In spite of Guy's VC bias, this chapter provides an incisive perspective into the unique challenges, priorities and tactics of the Boostrapper.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Fawlty Towers is the number one comedy series of all time. The episode: \\"The Germans\\" is the best comedy sitcom episode ever.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|It is very rare that when I first hear an album, I love it.  In fact, many take time to grow on me.  Well, Illinoise was love at first listen.  Best album of the year (subjectively and objectively :) )  I don't think anyone who listens to this will be disappointed.  Sufjan's voice is beautiful, and so is the \\"noise\\" of the instruments joining in harmony to create these amazing songs.
B000001Y5X|2.0|I bought the album with high expectations only to be disappointed. Some of the lyrics are thought provoking and creative, while others are just juvenile and stupid. Lousy vocals, below average instrumentally, and all in all just not Manson's best work. 'Cyclops' is one of the few songs I can tolerate, but still isn't enough to save this album from becoming a beverage coster on my livingroom table.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|Mark Knopfler's latest album Shangri-La finds the former Dire Straits frontman expressing his more mellow side. Yes the songs are softer than his earlier stuff, but it is beautiful music. The lyrics are those that only Knopfler could write, spellbinding and enchanting. His guitar is also great as always. The single Boom, Like That is no exception. The lyrics are about McDonald's founder Ray Kroc. Favorites include Boom, Like That, Sucker Row, Back To Tupelo, Our Shangri-La, Everybody Pays, Song For Sonny Liston, Whoop De Doo, Postcards From Paraguay, All That Matters, Stand Up Guy, Donegan's Gone, and Don't Crash the Ambulance. Highly Highly Recommended.
0792846443|5.0|Misery provides suspense as well as freaky stuff as James Caan and Kathy Bates play exciting roles. Paul Sheldon(James Caan) is a leading author of the 'Misery' series. Though, on a snowy New England road his car crashes and he is rescued by his No.1, some what unstable, fan. Though at first you might think Annie Wilkes(Kathy Bates) is an average caring lady, think again. The slick-two hander Stephen King adaption is like a prison cell for James Caan. With two mangled legs, his ideas of recovering safely are short lived after he finds out about her mood swings after she reads Paul's latest book. Then, Annie buys the latest Misery book. The physcopath is mad after her beloved Misery is dead and throws the tantrums at the recovering Paul Sheldon. And soon after that, a frightened but determined Paul finds that he will have to outwit a crazy and freakish Annie Wilkes. Soon enough he is told to destroy his own brought copy and make a new Misery where Misery returns and put Mrs. Wilkes name on it. He wanders around the house on two occasions due to he is isolated in one room. He finds her scrap book and is surprised by the horrifying truth. He stills a knife but when asleep has it snatched and is strapped to the bed helplessy and the result is he gets a painful experience after she finds out he had been gone the two occasions.  <br /> <br />Love the scene when a distraught Paul types f***f***f***f***f*** on the typewriter. It was one that made somebody laugh, even when Paul was in a bad situation. <br /> <br />Through this movie there are clues on how Paul was planning his revenge, one was when he was lifting the typewriter thus at the end he smashed it across her head. The healing did help him recover soon enough to get  his revenge. Also the picking the lock scene was clever due it was a coeincidence he found the object on the floor.  <br /> <br />The bloody scene at the end when the two are having a scrappy dog fight and Paul stuffs the burnt Misery copy in Annie's mouth made me feel better due she did shoot the sherrif with a shotgun. She (the bitch) eventually died. Thank god for that. The scene at the very end when the approaching waitress(with Annie's face) made me think she had came back to life. Cartoonish freakish stuff made this movie unpredictable. Thank you Rob Reiner was putting together at last a great movie by the name of Stephen King. Kath Bates deservedly won an Academy Award for her fine freakish performance. <br /> <br />'Misery' will put you out of your misery. <br />
B0000025T6|5.0|No one was ready for this when it first came out. Springsteen, his guitar, and his harmonica make some beautiful music. This is some of his best songs he ever written. A concept album of some sort Springsteen tells tales of murder, deception, and redemption. To make the album even darker he made all acoustic which was a brillant move IMO. Favorites include Nebraska, Atlantic City, Mansion on the Hill, Johnny 99, Highway Patrolman, State Trooper, My Father's House, and Reason to Believe. An album that should be owned by any Springsteen fan. Highly Highly Recommended.
0880796863|4.0|The Tarot deck itself is fine. The booklet accompanying the Tarot deck is missing page 147. Instead, page 145 is duplicated. When I contacted the company, the person I communicate with seemed nonchalant about the problem. She did send me a xeroxed page 147. When I said I would like a complete booklet, she advised I would have to talk to the publisher.
B0007LCNKM|5.0|I got this CD a week ago and can't stop listening to it. Especially now, when it rains and the fall is coming up, it's a perfect companion. Melancholy songs straight from the heart.
B00006LLNU|1.0|If I could rate music on amazon with negative stars i would. I really think this music is a terrible and cruel joke. Save your integrity and your friends...stay clear of this cd.
B0006L16N8|2.0|Don't give in to all the hype about this album like I did. I loved the single Speed of Sound, heard great things about the album, and saw it the store for 9.99. I usually preview albums before I buy them but I didn't with this one and that was my mistake. I figured I'd check it out because it was so cheap. I think Coldplay is a good band and had lots of potential for this album but failed to execute. There are a few good highlights like Square One, Speed of Sound, and Talk but the rest of the album has a dull drawn out sound to it. It was a disappointment.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah is back in all her glory (would be a little better if there were a few more balads), but overall this album is excellent.  Even non Mariah fans will like this because there is a lot of the vocal gymnastics that has disappeared.  Thankfully.  Anyway, this seems to be a little more real to her personality and much more enjoyable than her last two cds.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|13 songs on this cd and every one is fantastic. What a treat! <br /> <br />Comparisons of Mr. Buble to many of the late greats are inevitable even though he has his own exceptional voice and sound. I believe this guy will be the one others would love to be compared to in the future. Passion and feeling for the music is what really sets him apart from today's crop of crooners - he seems to live the music note by note and you will hear romance and fun on this outstanding offering.   <br /> <br />
B0007TKNIS|3.0|I was not as attentive watching the movie as I was watching the play. It seemed to drag to me, especially the singing. Can'r compare it to the play!
B000002J6F|3.0|First off, I want to say , I am a HUGE Stills fan, and in fact a huge fan of all the Crosby, stills, Nash & Young  family of acts- Buffalo Springfield and Byrds right on through. Have been for years.  <br /> <br />So why only three for this \\"classic\\" of the genre? It sounds great- obviously a massive effort that represents Still's attempt at a personal masterwork. So what's the prolbem? Very simple- the songs. There is simply not a single song on here that anyone can remember ten minutes after listening to it. In old fashioned terms, there are no \\"singles\\"- nothing that stands up on its own independent of the collection. Not a single song on here comes anywhere near \\"For What It's Worth\\", \\"Love the One Your With\\" or \\"4+20\\". This is weird, because Stills had so many great tunes \\"Cary On\\", Suite Judy Blue Eyes\\", \\"Bluebird\\", \\"Sit Yourself Down\\" \\"49 Bye byes\\" that stood up on their own. This whole set is completley average Stills songs- now that's pretty good, but not really five star great.  <br /> <br />My cousin bought his album when it first came out- I was 13 and I wondered what the fuss was about- it didn't grab me. I bought it on vinal in the early eighties- was all fired up to really get into this time- it still didn't grab me. Bought it again this year on CD, very eager to hear it again, and once again, It didn't grab me. This time,however, I've finally figured it out- there are no hooks here to grab you. <br /> <br />Then again, maybe the very fact I keep coming back to it searchng for something says more about it than I can describe. It is a fascinating album, well worht the exploration, and a good one- but all these five star reviews, no way. Go to the first Stills solo album and compare. No way this is five compared to THAT!        <br />     <br />  <br /> <br />
0789723107|5.0|This is one of the best books for understanding usability of website design.  <br />The book is easy to read and gives great examples for practical usability.  <br />Steve Krug hits on the most important items concerning website usability and \\"skimmability\\". He is not afraid to point out the problems with some of the common website \\"standards\\", like three-click rule.  <br />He reviews sites from a user's perspective who are there for information and not from a designer's perspective.  <br />Absolutely a must-read for everyone who deals with any facet of web design.
B0000C7PQK|1.0|Cretu doesn't care anymore and he's just trying to keep his record company off his back.  The first three Enigma CDs were some of the most innovative and brilliant works I've ever heard!  That stuff was amazing!  The fourth CD seemed a little uninspired in comparison, but it was still something special.  Now, we've only been served nonsense from Enigma. <br /> <br />     Only a \\"sliver\\" remains of the Enigma we once knew.  This CD is just a bunch of empty noise.  Gone are the profound songs like \\"Rivers of Belief,\\" \\"Return to Innocence,\\" \\"Push the Limits,\\" etc.  Instead what you'll find on Voyageur is a bunch of bubble-gum pop that would make Milli Vanilli seem profound (Boum-Boum, The Look of Today).  Thankfully, there is some relief from the pop nonsense but only in the form of terribly uninspired trance (Total Eclipse of the Moon, etc.). <br /> <br />    In sum, I think Voyageur is one big joke from Cretu to his record company and fans.  (Ever heard the \\"Violent U.S. remix\\" of Sadeness?  If so, you'll know what I'm talking about.) <br /> <br />    If you want pop, buy Jewel's new CD.  If you're looking for profound and innovative music, like Enigma's prior CDs, you won't find it here.  Avoid this one!
B00064AM6C|4.0|One of the most wierd concerts to be seen. I enjoyed it for what it was. An 8mm recording this day in time is kinda backwards in itself, huh? I suppose that's kinda their motto though. Simple sounding rock & roll. The two of them are the \\"entire\\" band remember....

0312954468|4.0|The River God and its 2 companion novels are a wild ride, never a dull moment and books the reader can't put down. Good character development, romance, great detail and very humorous too. All of the above is five star. The only drawback for me, an ardent student of Egyptology since 5 years old, the story is about no known historical characters or dynasty,so it can be occasionally jarring to someone with knowledge of details of Egyptian history, but this allows Smith full reign to his imagination and a totally enjoyable read for all despite us hard-core sticklers for Egyptian history. Highly recommended, as are all of Smith's books, whatever the subject. PLEASE NOTE there are two other books dealing with this story, if you enjoyed it, The Seventh scroll and Warlock. Don't miss any of them.
0385337388|4.0|It seems you expected the author to share his thoughts. Perhaps interns don't think any more? I know I didn't. My brother maintains I became a zombie during internship. We were so swamped with mundane tasks that we'd get through them as well as we could and drop into bed, thankfully. I never dreamed during that time, except on vacation, when I had nightmares about the hospital every night. I found the book true to life, except for the sexual escapades, which fell victim to the Zeitgeist, and I remain grateful to Shem for daring to write it. (Disclaimer: Though I did take antidepressants briefly during internship, I am now reasonably happy in private practice and have enough time to pursue all the hobbies I had as a medical student and before that. A study published in the British Medical Journal found one-half of female interns and one-third of their male colleagues had a major depression at some time during their first year. So I'm normal, and Shem didn't make it up. And he did keep his day job - didn't you know?)
B00003CXDB|5.0|This movie is one of the best portayals of Wallstreet out there. Yes there is some creative license taken but that's Hollywood. The script is great, the cast is phenomenal and Oliver Stone does a really good job with this film.
0895260131|4.0|I read this book cover to cover on a transatlantic flight. It is brutally honest, exploding commonly held myths and I won't steal the author's thunder here. Read it yourself. It is worth it. He candidly talks about Crusader atrocities as well, and makes no excuse for them. Both sides making mistakes? No way right? This is not unusual in war. If you have never been to war, then you won't understand this.  <br />People will believe what they want to believe. One should only care for the truth. Having spent a lot of time in the Middle East, I have developed an affinity for most Arabs that I have met. It is hard not to. They are so hospitable and engaging. <br />I also speak, read and write Arabic and my father does as well. I deeply admire the Bedouin ways, the strong family ties that Arabs have and the religious conviction of the majority of Muslims.  <br />That does not change the facts, however. \\"Dhimmitude\\" as Spencer calls it, is still alive and well today, albeit in a more modern form. Islam is hands down the most intolerant of all the world's major religions. Their prophet (or messenger if you really want to be true to the language) was a general, not a messiah. If you dont believe me book a flight to Saudi or Sudan and see for yourself. They have religious police that can beat your ass and raid your home with no warrant. If you are a woman, walk around by yourself in a fundalmentalist Arab nation in western clothing and I guarantee you will be beaten and killed. Women have little or no rights in a strict Islamic society.  <br />What amazes me more than anything is blacks in the US that embrace Islam. I have never heard more rampant use of the N word than I did when I was in Saudi Arabia amongst Saudi officers. There are NO blacks in the officer ranks in the Saudi military. You can be jailed for talking about Christianity or any other religion besides Islam and there are no churches anywhere. Have you noticed all of the mosques that are springing up all over America? Try and build a church in Tehran or Jiddah or start up a bible study in Karachi. You will probably be burned alive along with it and no one will be prosecuted. The Saudis also quizzed us to see if we had any jews or \\"Zionists\\" in our unit.  <br />People talk about separation of church and state here in the USA (which, incidentally, is not to be found ANYWHERE in our constitution) you can forget it in nearly every Muslim nation on this earth. ISLAM is the only religion and it is ENFORCED by the government. It is called Sharia. The Quran is the bill of rights and everything else. <br />In the US we have freedom of religion and no one religion is forced on anyone. FACT: The US sent 10 times as much aid as all of the muslim nations put together. We sent food, water, money  civilian and military personnel to save lives in the aftermath of the Tsunami. Did you hear about any massive airlifts from any of the oil rich nations of the Gulf? Did you know that Indo has more Muslims than any other nation on earth?   FACT: The day the towers were burning, there were hordes of Muslims dancing in the streets of Jersey City, right across the river, celebrating while innocents fell to their death or were burned alive. FACT: Recently in Tijuana, a cafe was raided by joint US and Mexican authorities that has aided THOUSANDS of Middle Eastern terrorists crossing into the US illegally. No way you say? If an illiterate peasant from Oaxaca can get in the US unchecked, why would anyone be surprised that a trained operative determined to kill \\"infidels\\" would have any problem? FACT: Guantanamo Bay is not the hellish nightmare that the press makes it out to be. Truthfully, these terrorists are treated better and more fairly in detention and enjoy better living conditions than most US personnel in the field. (There are exceptions, of course. Some of our troops are quartered in Saddam's ex-palaces, of which there are more than 900). These detainees' religious rights, even in detention, are honored. When an American noncombatant is captured, he is tortured, exploited and beheaded on film. FACT: while there were some definite acts of misconduct at Abu Ghraib, NOTHING that happened there was as awful as the survival training that most troops go through before deploying and everything that happened there was comedy compared to the atrocities committed on US personnel in SE Asia.  <br />This book has many irrefutable and easily substantiated claims in it about the true nature of Islam. Read it if you dare...
0671015206|5.0|When I was in the Army lots of soldiers came to me because they wanted to learn about personal finance.  Most of them were fresh out of high school and had never really been taught about the subject.  I was considered the expert for two reasons.  One, I had a business degree and knew a good deal about the subject.  Second, and most important, I traveled and went out with them a lot but always managed to have money at the end of the month. <br /> <br />The first thing I would do is make any one interested in finance read this book.  I either loaned them my copy or had them purchase it.  It is a worthy investment.  The main reason I did this was to break the myths of wealth and lifestyles.  This book is an excellent way of doing that. <br /> <br />Once they understood what the typical millionaire was really like and how they lived they knew they could do it too.  This book is not about getting rich overnight or living so poorly that you only enjoy your life when you are ready to die.  It is a guide for how to live a little below your means and being able to save for the future. <br /> <br />With the aid of this book I helped numerous soldiers set up separate accounts and research possible investments.  Every once in awhile I get an e-mail from one of these guys thanking me for putting them on the right path and it makes me feel really good..  If you, or anyone you know, live beyond your means and live form paycheck to paycheck then get this book.  If you follow it you will be better off. <br />
B00000AFHM|4.0|Heirs to the twin traditions of 60s psychadelic pop and British 80s indie (a less cynical Smiths, at times), The Boy With The Arab Strap is Belle and Sebastian at their best - sweet, literate indie which isn't quite as fey as some of their other releases, and just glides through the course of an album. The best track by a country mile is the utterly gorgeous 'Sleep The Clock Around', which features wide-eyed vocals, an aching melody, and a burgeoning arrangement which gradually builds into a gentle cascade of tumbling drums, bleeping synths, and later, quirkily, bagpipies. But there are other good tracks: in particular the upbeat 'Dirty Dream Number Two', which contains a great melody and a perfectly executed string arrangement, along with some almost funk-influenced guitar work, and the jangle-pop of the lovely 'A Summer Wasting'. Reccomended even to the sceptical.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I've been a fan of \\"STAR WARS\\" since I was 12 or 13 years old and have seen the original films more than once (see my review of the original trilogy on DVD), so I expected the 1st episode of the saga to be good. When I first saw this movie in 9th grade (my first summer in high school before 9th grade, actually), however, I hated this film, as I expected it to get into the romance between Padme and Anakin, although I did like two scenes (more on that below). Since  \\"STAR WARS Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith\\" (see my review on this film and the previous installment, \\"STAR WARS Episode II: Attack Of The Clones\\") will be on DVD and video stores November 1 (can't wait), I thought, \\"Might as well check it out again.\\" Read on.<br /><br />Well, screw me for having lost faith in Mr. Lucas. I completely changed my opinion of this film when I saw it again for the first time in four years...and with new eyes. I LOVED IT!! For the life of me however, I can't figure out why in bloody hell a lot of die-hard fans bashed this movie (it earned $400 million at the box-office; domestically, anyway) and Jar-Jar Binks. I thought that he was completely comical. Liam Neeson (\\"Schindler's List\\" [see my review on it] and the voice of Aslan in the upcoming \\"The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe,\\" coming to theaters December 9, 2005), the always-lovely and excellent Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd and Ewan McGregor (whose performance got even better in the next two films) did great jobs in the first of three films which tell the story of how Anakin Skywalker (a terrific Hayden Christensen in \\"Episode II\\" and \\"Episode III\\" [see my review on them, as well as the original trilogy], exuding all of Anakin's emotional pain as he struggles between good and evil); the original films deal with-I won't spoil it; those of you who've seen them, shut up and let the newcomers discover the story for themseleves. I particularly liked two scenes (including one which was cut from the film and appears in the deleted scenes section on Disc 2), which I thought were too damn brief. Lucas should've expanded them, but as he says in the \\"Deleted Scenes Documentary, \\"What interests me might not interest the audience\\"<br /><br />...and he was right, unfortunately; but what the hell. Rated PG for sci-fi violence.m and appears in the deleted scenes section on Disc 2), which I thought were too damn brief.

B00004W221|5.0|I was very skeptical to see this movie when it came out. I figured it was like the boy who could fly so I didn't see it until 2002. It was lent to me by a friend from HONDURAS. My friend Andres said I would like it, if I liked Hoosiers. I liked Hoosiers and Larry Bird is my favorite basketball player of all time but this movie blows Hoosiers away. This shows you even if you feel like you are alone or are an underdog you can do anything on your mind. Don't ever let anyone tell you it can't be done!!!!!! If you see this movie and you don't have any tears of joy or goosebumps you should refocus you life. I did however think the end was corny with the Rudy chant which is why it took me 9 years to see this movie.  <br /> <br />This movie is all about passion and drive. Do you have it and if you don't get it, it's what this country is all about. <br /> <br />Randy <br /> <br />Back to basketball, I have a question for all. <br /> <br />Do you think Michael Jordan ruined basketball??? <br /> <br />HE DID <br /> <br />When Bird and Magic were running in the 80's he came in and created this 1 on 1 thing.  <br />It was unintentional but people saw AIR JORDAN and it was all ahout him  and the team game was dead!!! He became a team player eventually and probably the greatest ever but he created this crap on the court and in LIFE!!
B00005JNTX|5.0|This Movie is The Best of 2005! Every Single Second Is Amazing. This Movie is directed by an all star director named Robert Rodriguez. If you don't know him, well, you suck.

Also Be ready for the long waited special edition dvd.
0525457585|5.0|This work is in a league of its own.  I've never seen anything as imaginative as this.  It even beats the works of Lewis Carroll in that department.  You have to pay attention to every word or else you may miss something fantastic.<br /><br />So many insane sights are described in this book that it's impossible to remember them all.  There's a rabbit covered in colorful feathers, there's a striped hippopotamus whose front and back ends walk independently, there's a man shaving a mirror, there's a tree that's its own grandmother, the list goes on and on.  I think since there are so many wacky things that are so briefly mentioned, many of these things don't get the popularity they deserve.<br /><br />The second half of the book really shines and sets up some very interesting scenarios totally absent from any of the Neverending Story movies, particularly the existance of the lion in the Desert of Many Colors.  That poor lion has it rough since Bastian creates an environment for him where he is doomed to eternal loneliness.<br /><br />I noticed no real problems with the translation; there may be a few differences like calling goose bumps goose flesh, but that might just be a new creative way of describing an old term and has nothing to do with translation.<br /><br />Regardless of whether you get a nice colorful hardcover version, or a cheaper paperback version like I did, don't pass this story up.
B00005JNTX|5.0|OK, I just have to say that the ONLY complaint I've ever heard about this movie is that is it \\"too violent\\". <br />Let's get this straight... it's called Sin City, it's presented as 3 stories about revenge. If someone was going to this movie expecting the care bears... well that's their own fault. <br />And really, violent? Fist fights, guns, and the idea (without the actual view of the act)of torture. What action movie does not have these elements? <br />Let's see, Braveheart: Fist fights, sword fights, graphic deaths, and torture. <br />Passion of the Christ: Graphic torture and death. <br />Hostage: Guns, knives, and burning bodies. <br />Face it, violence in american cinema is as normal as sex in french cinema, get over it. Sin City is a wonderful noir story (stories) with fantastic acting (it's based on a graphic novel with very one-dimensional characters, they played the part well). The direction is great with beautiful style. I would reccomend this to anyone who didn't have a problem with violence.  <br />If you DO have a problem, then don't watch it. Instead, lock yourself indoors, switch on your parental controls to your tivo, and stick to family programing and romantic comedys.
B00005NB0H|5.0|<br />   Over the past months, I've turned into a pretty diehard Who fanatic. I started from the beginning (The Who Sings My Generation), and recently came across Live at Leeds in my library. Oh my god, what an amazing performance! <br /> <br />   The band warms up, starts off with \\"Heaven and Hell\\", and never looks back. Everybody seems to be in perfect shape. Keith Moon's drumming is chaotic and blood rushing. Entwistle's bass lines are clear and fast paced. Roger Daltey and Pete Townshend's singing is great, and who could forget Townshend's guitar work here?! At this point, I've never heard a solo as memorable as Townshends during \\"Heaven and Hell\\". <br /> <br />   The rest of disc one is a daze to me (in a good way). Everybody was playing their hearts out, and I was floored by the end of Magic Bus. <br /> <br />   Disc two contains a performance of \\"Thomas\\" that sounded very much similar to the studio version. Just as entertaining as the first disc, too. <br /> <br />   The crowd was very energetic, and I laughed out loud at some of their random, crazy remarks. The overall sound quality is just awesome. I listen to this album more than any other. That should be enough to convince you that this is one heck of a Who performance. It easily gets a 5/5 in my books! <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|I luv Coldplay!!!!  They are so good to listen to!!!!!!!!!!!!    I luv \\"Square One\\"!  It's really nice!! :-)    Also, I like \\"Till Kingdom Come\\"!!  It's the hidden track which is actually pretty easy to find.  Just go to track 13! I like it cuz I was gonna off myself--cuz life is dank and empty :-(         And I was all ready to do it (I had a friend who was gonna drop a way cool computer on me from 20 floors above) but I heard \\"Till\\" on my iPod and I waved up at him to not drop the thing!        I also really like \\"Talk\\"!  The melody is sooo good!!  :-P
0790740443|5.0|This movie is a must-see. I have never seen acting this good. <br /> <br />In writing, people say \\"show, don't tell,\\" meaning that it is better to describe a person's emotional state through actions (so-and-so clenched his fist and his jaw bunched tensely) rather than just saying it (so-and-so was angry). <br /> <br />Kurt Russell's perfomance took this to heart. Without hardly any words to \\"tell\\" his emotions, he conveyed them beautifully through subtle actions. I especially like that little head tilt at the end when he--to the astonishment of his fellow soldiers--picked up the little boy. Such a tiny motion, yet it said it all. <br /> <br />This is a movie I will watch again many times and enjoy it no matter how often I have already seen it.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Well, this show includes a number of elements that would normally put me off.  I am more often annoyed than charmed by casts of relentlessly quirky characters that are calculated to be lovable, but I was conquered by the Gilmore Girls. The show is just so well-written and refreshingly innocent and the cast is so good that I couldn't help watching most of the episodes with a big smile on my face.  The many distinctive personalities of Stars Hollow form a well-developed community worthy of comparison with Cicely, Alaska of \\"Northern Exposure,\\" the 4077th of \\"MASH,\\" and Mayberry of \\"The Andy Griffith Show.\\"   <br /> <br />Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel are perfect as the mother-daughter pair of Lorelei and Rory who are more like sisters due to Lorelei's early pregnancy.  Lorelei's struggle to form a sane relationship with her mother (Kelly Bishop), Rory's attempts to fit in at the ritzy Chilton Academy, and both women's adventures in love provide the material for some fine television.  A standout episode is \\"Rory's Dance,\\" in which her genuinely joyful relationship with boyfriend Dean (Jared Padalecki) inadvertantly shames a roomful of cynical rich brats.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|This review is for the 2003 Twentieth Century Fox DVD.    The movie opens with Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) returning home from prison due to killing a man who stabbed him in a dance hall fight.  When Tom returns to his home community in rural dustbowl Oklahoma, he learns that the banks are running off all the families who have worked on their farms for several generations.  Joad's entire extended family plus a friend, Casey (John Carradine), are left with no choice but to journey west to California since it appears to be the land of opportunity.  So they pile everyone and everything they own on an old dilapidated truck and head west.  The rest of the movie shows the trials and tribulations of this arduous trip as well as the obstacles they face in California.    The cinematography of this film is gripping, not because of visual beauty - far from it - but for the realism of the filthiness and poverty.  But even beyond the squalor, the story masterfully reveals in poignant fashion the life and death hardships and day-to-day hope for survival.  The acting is great, especially by Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) who won an Oscar for her performance.  The movie is a bit heavy-handed with some obvious communist propaganda depicting privately owned farms as tyrannical and fatally oppressive, while government sponsored camps appearing utopian in every aspect.  But overlooking the political overtones, the best message to take from the movie is the importance of family and the will for survival.    As for the DVD, the picture was restored, but not perfectly restored, since some deterioration is still visible, but the overall presentation is very adequate for a film made in 1940.  The sound is very good too, but at times seems to have a hollow sound to it.  There are plenty of bonus features on this double-sided DVD.  A nice package overall.      Movie: A    DVD Quality: A-
B00004Y2FT|5.0|I'll be brief - The Cocteau Twins have made some of the most heavenly, lush, etheral, otherworldly music I've ever heard. The atmospheres they create are so palpable you can almost step into them. For years, my personal favorite CT song was \\"Pink Orange Red,\\" originally on the TINY DYNAMINE ep. Alas, I became permanently seperated from my old vinyl collection from the 80s (long story) and couldn't get this song for ages. So when STARS AND TOPSOIL came out and I saw \\"Pink Orange Red\\" on it, I snatched it up in a heartbeat.<br /><br />I would agree that this is not a \\"best-of\\" collection, but nearly every song here is fantastic. Actually, it does include my least favorite CT song \\"Sugar Hiccup,\\" but I'm the only one that seems to be mildly annoyed with this track so no matter. Undenyably, STARS does include some of CT's best music, like \\"Aikea-Guinea.\\"<br /><br />This is a fine place to start for newbes although just about anywhere will work since most of their music is wonderful. My first CT was THE PINK OPAQUE which actually is somewhat of a \\"best of\\" collection. Maybe the best album to pick up first would be TREASURE or their debut GARLANDS which is a bit heavier, darker and gothic compared to some of their later works which focus more on beauty. Some of the last few albums they released like HEAVEN OR LAS VEGAS are a bit more slick and digestable, but still great.
B0009UC810|5.0|I highly recommend this movie.  The Blues Brothers cause all kinds of mayhem trying to save an orphanage from being shut down.  A nun shows her appreciation of their concern by beating them mercilessly with a ruler.  They manage to upset all kinds of other people along the way, most notably a country band they impersonate to land a gig.  Then they have to worry about a mysterious and insane woman played by Carrie Fisher of Star Wars fame who keeps trying to blow them up, gun them down, or do anything else she can to kill them.<br /><br />As if this isn't enough, they end up getting Nazis chasing after them too, as well as policemen, SWAT teams, and army officers.<br /><br />But their quest isn't all worries.  They manage to have some fun jamming with a crooked salesman played by Ray Charles, a mean diner manager played by Aretha Franklin, and the Godfather of Soul in a very spiritual church.<br /><br />Very well done and loaded with great songs and jokes.  The fancy restaurant scene alone is enough to make this a classic.
B000002LCI|4.0|Depeche Mode - Music for the Masses (1987)<br /><br />I've been a fan since SOME GREAT REWARD. When MUSIC FOR THE MASSES first came out, I didn't like the title for starters. I didn't want music for the masses, I wanted dark, tripped-out music too cool for the mainstream to be able appreciate - hopefully something along the lines of the new direction they had taken with BLACK CELEBRATION (which it is, to a certain extent). MUSIC FOR THE MASSES actually could be music for the masses in an alternate reality, especially if more classical music lovers could expand their palates to include electronic music. When I first heard this, I wouldn't have given the album more than 3 stars, mainly because the rest of it paled in comparison to \\"Never Let Me Down Again\\" and \\"Strangelove,\\" to my mind. These two songs represent the point where Depeche first reached the absolute peak of what they are capable of, standing tall alongside later greats like the powerful \\"I Feel You\\" and the harrowing \\"Barrel of a Gun.\\"<br /><br />I really wasn't ready for this album when I first heard it; I can appreciate it more today although it definitely has a few weak spots. To figure out exactly how I'd rate it today, I decided to type out a \\"breakdown.\\"<br /><br />Here's my breakdown of MUSIC FOR THE MASSES:<br /><br />\\"Never Let Me Down Again\\" - commanding, driving track, commonly considered to be a song about addiction, although you don't have to interpret it that way . . . this one carries painfully framed spitting images of devastating relevance for me so I'll refrain from further comment except to say this is one of their best . . . *****<br /><br />\\"The Things You Said\\" - previously considered to be a negligible song by yours truly (because I just wanted to ROCK), this is a contemplative mood piece. It's apparently about a girl who betrayed the singer by talking about him behind his back - and he found out.  ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Strangelove\\" - an addictive, tripped-out groove machine. Depending on tastes of course, this song is VERY sexy if kinda freaky and S&M tinged - some of the best DM lyrics  . . . *****+<br /><br />\\"Sacred\\" - yes, it would've been impossible to follow \\"Strangelove,\\" but this is one of their weakest tunes. Lyrically, lyricist Martin Gore is onto something but it's not fully realized. **<br /><br />\\"Little 15\\" - has a spare, classical sound, no drums, stately piano touches. The song is addressed to \\"little 15.\\" It's really gorgeous and Gore seems to have put himself in the shoes of a 15-yr-old girl which makes the lyrics quite convincing. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Behind the Wheel\\" - another one that took me too long to get into, this one is kind of a coda to \\"Little 15.\\" More great lyrics with some of that catchy melodramatic edge DM are so good at delivering. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"I Want You Now\\" - This is a very spare track with quite suggestive breathing and moaning rhythmic overdubs - sexy. But there's a less-than-noble undercurrent to this song if you're paying attention. ****<br /><br />\\"To Have and to Hold\\" - a powerful, doom-laden little piece and a plea for forgiveness. ****<br /><br />\\"Nothing\\" - super-catchy, old-school style DM with intelligent contemplations on \\"nothing.\\" *****<br /><br />\\"Pimpf\\" - this is a brooding instrumental. ****<br /><br />\\"Agent Orange\\" - A great instrumental piece; so good in fact that I'll rate it - *****<br /><br />NOTE - I completely sympathize with the reviewer that follows me, Angela.P - this album might've held up better had the last three tracks been labled \\"bonus\\" tracks instead of appearing to be part of the \\"proper\\" album.<br /><br />\\"Never Let Me Down Again (Aggro Mix)\\" - Inferior to the previous version, but I tend to look at these kinds of album tracks the same way I look at \\"reprises\\" from a Broadway play. This version adds a kind of \\"James Bond\\" feel to the original and pretty much leaves out the lyrics. ***<br /><br />\\"To Have and to Hold (Spanish Taster)\\" - this version has a more distinctive DM sound. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Pleasure Little Treasure\\" - a fun, old-school DM-style rocker featuring an actual acoustic guitar, the instrument Martin L. Gore supposedly writes all of his songs on. Ends the album with some trippy dissected voices.  ****<br /><br />So, adding up my tally, this record averages out to four stars, not three as I previously would've rated it. Kiss-ass die-hards who refuse to rate anything from Depeche less than 5 stars can kiss mine because this is an honest, well thought out opinion. Really, what good would this forum be if people churned out nothing but praise and 5-star reviews? Critical thinking is essential. Peace!inctive DM sound. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Pleasure Little Treasure\\" - a fun, old-school DM-style rocker featuring an actual acoustic guitar, the instrument Martin L.

B000066NW0|5.0|unlike Ashlee, Avril is a mogul in her genre, one of the few albums in my collection with every song outstanding.. I really love this whole album there  isn't a song I skip..
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fox executives were stupid to cancel this show. It is the best show  Fox ever aired. Good thing they were able to make a movie version, maybe they'll be able to bring back the series if it does well.
0930289528|4.0|Yeah yeah, it's a landmark publication... blah blah <br /> <br />I got a bit bored to be honest, just didn't care about the characters all that much. It makes you think, but it's somewhat dated. Every serious comic afficionado should try to read this at some stage, but only people over 30s (or very well read modern history students) are likely to get the whole picture.
B000001FS3|5.0|kick arse album! <br />my favourite tracks <br />with or without you - classic <br />where the streets have no name - U2 summed up <br />bullet the blue sky - love it <br />in god's country - the gutar on this is amazing, very simple but extrermly effective and atmospheric
0141301155|5.0|It came in good time and was in perfect shape.  Thank you.
0767830555|5.0|A simplistic plot, yet such fierce writing, acting and directing make this a must-see for anyone who calls themself a  film buff.      Taxi Driver tells the story of Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who is a loner on the streets of New York, and drives a taxi on the night shift.  Travis is slowly slipping into severe depression with the 'scum on the streets' he sees whilst driving his cab at night. 'They're all animals anyway. All the animals come out at night: (...), skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal... Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets.'    Thus marks Travis' hopes for the future of New York. But when this doesn't appear to be taking affect, he decides to take matters into his own hands, sparked off by some encounters with a few individuals.  The first of which is Betsy, a campaign worker for a presidential candidate, whom Travis spots at the candidate's headquaters - 'That taxi driver has been staring at us' - and attempts to woo. However his idea of this is a little different from most people's, when on their first date he takes to her to a porn film, which she promtly walks out of.    The next of whom is an underage hooker and her pimp, the former being named Iris, the latter 'Sport'. Travis is both shocked and angry to find out Iris is only 12 years old, and attempts to persuade her to desert her pimp and return to her parents, of which he also fails.      Driven by his manic depression and overwhelming powerlessness, he buys four handguns and sets out do something which may turn him from a nobody into a somebody...    Robert De Niro's performance in this film changed my opinion of him forever.  Before I thought he was just some overrated has-been who always acted the same in every movie (if you can belive that!). His performance is so powerful and so sure I couldn't believe he wasn't Travis Bickle. I was genuinely suprised when I learned he hadn't won the Best Actor Oscar.  I was disappointed too - his has become one of my favourite performances of all time.  I even got a bit of a crush on him after seeing this film (he was handsome back then).    The supporting performances are all excellent too, in particular young Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel. Foster, never a generic beauty but a competent and capable actress, gives one of the best performances of her career.  And Keitel, well he's Harvey Keitel, still cool, still perfect, just with dark brown hair and a young face.     Vivid and inspired direction from Martin Scorsese, and a top notch screenplay from Paul Schrader, ultimaltely makes Taxi Driver one of those films you can watch again and again without losing interest and one of my perosnal favourites. Highly recommened.
B0009OPO0S|5.0|I love this CD...it is Shakira's best work yet. Each song has its own unique character to it, so it's hard to get bored from them. From the psychadelic \\"Escondite Ingles\\" to the Sinatra-inspired \\"Obtener Un Si\\" to the dance hall style of \\"La Tortura,\\" this is an album worth every bit of its penny. Owning the DualDisc is better than owning the CD alone. You can see the La Tortura video, along with a short \\"making-of\\" documentary and a longer but very humorous interview made by Spanish singer Alejandro Sanz, the guest artist of La Tortura (both remixes). The other invited artist in this album is Gustavo Cerati from Argentina, who participates in the recordings of \\"Dia Especial\\" and \\"No.\\" <br />The lyrics along with the English translations are found on the DVD as well as on the CD jacket. You also have exclusive online access to information about \\"Oral Fixation 2,\\" which is Shakira's upcoming English album (its release date is November 15th, 2005). You can get this access when you visit shakira.com, insert the CD in your disc drive and click on the \\"Virtual Club\\" icon. <br />This is a work of art that you don't want to miss!
014028009X|4.0|Before there was \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic,\\" there was Bridget Jones Diary...<br /><br />And to be fair, before there was \\"Bridgett Jones\\" there was \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"<br /><br />This book is one of the few that makes me REALLY laugh out loud. I just love Brigett! And it helps that I saw the movie before the reading the book, because I have Colin Firth in my head the whole time.<br /><br />Good book, but the second is a lot funnier in my humble opinion.
1577311523|5.0|You must read this book and experience the true awareness of every page.It is if the pages really are  alive. When the words touch in thought you feel a physical transformation.   I have read many books of this nature, none have this simple and almost automatic understanding of every point. I will read this book many times.Randy  <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead was perhaps the most innovative and original band of the 90s, and \\"OK computer\\" represents them at their peak.  This album has got it all: amazing musical composition, startling lyrics, sophisticated arrangements and production, subtlety, diverse textures, etc.  It is truly a masterpiece from a great band at its creative peak.  This is also Radiohead while they were still accessible.  Later albums still have brilliance, but are far less approachable due to serious experimentation. <br /> <br />Note: this is not an easy-listening album.  It's an album with disturbing moments and ideas, and songs that are plain upsetting (e.g. \\"Fitter, happier,\\" which in my opinion gets better with every listening).  The musicianship is masterfull, though those in search of monster solos and show-offmanship will be sorely disappointed.  It is subtle, and that is the point.  Radiohead has always been about a cohesive product rather than spotlighting skills, and this album is one of the best examples of that in all of rock music.  In that way Radiohead compares favorably with epic bands like the Beatles. <br /> <br />No, it is not the best album ever.  But it is the best alternative album of a generation, and has the crossover appeal to progressive rock fans.  This latter is key, because \\"OK Computer\\" represents a truly rare prog-rock like success in the 90s and since.  Although not true prog rock, they are darned close to it, and will appeal a lot to fans of truly new directions.
B000002H33|5.0|this album is great. my only metallica album and i have to say i plan to buy more after hearing this. i heard all the hype surrounding this one so i figured id eat up the 16 bucks without hearing any of the songs beforehand. one listen is all it takes. since there is over 1000 other reviews im not going to go into extreme detail but this is one piece of work that you NEED to have.
B00007AJF9|5.0|I think that this is the best film about Good Queen Bess since Elizabeth R. The writing and acting was 1st rate and some one paid attention to historical fact to boot.I thought the character of Walshingham was an added plus to the film. Well done to all hands!
0143034901|4.0|I didn't think I would enjoy this kind of book but ended up reading it as part of a book club that I joined. I was pleasantly surprised because the intricacy with which the characters are described and their interactions was wonderful. There was comic relief...yes in a \\"gothic\\" novel...and tragedy at the same time. The story was a little slower starting than I would like but well worth it. And it brought to life the beauty of Barcelona...
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah  it down for you with this record..She is emancipated. And she is free from control, opression. or the power of another as the defination of emancipation states. So to the review below asking \\"Is she was a rapper\\"? The answer is \\"YES\\" and she also so much more. The fact that Mariah can play with her lyrics and still sing chilling ballads shows how great Mimi is. Mariah's versitale and cannot be clumped into one category..It's across the board domination. Sometimes its not what you say but how you say it.
B000002952|5.0|I had only recently discovered music download sites and was looking for love songs from south of the border. I had never heard Gloria Estefan before and got lucky on my first download. It was one of the songs from this album and I was instantly enchanted by the lush orchestration, the beauty of the melodies and the sincerity with which delivered the song. Nearly every \\"cancion\\" in the album has the same premier quality. The addition of a bilingual \\"libretto\\" was very welcome. <br /> <br />Dave Gillis

B0009S4IHY|5.0|this movie is a sort of unexpected hilarious comedy and action kung fu film. i did not expected it to be so freaking funny and the kung fu scenes so well done at the same time. is action/adventure/romance/comedy all in one. anyone who doesn't laugh while watching this movie must be a depressed person. <br /> <br />see it, watch it, enjoy it and recommend it.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Great album I only wish they could have added To live is to die, and Orion.
1400032717|1.0|I am reading this book for high school summer reading. It is the most boring book ever written! There is no humor at all and the main character has no personality and talks about pointless stuff that we dont care about. God! i waisted one week of my life on this boring peice of crap. I recomend that the book should not be read by children because of explict language. Please ignore this book at all costs.
0895260131|4.0|John Spencer's book is bold, brash, and horribly beautiful.  Spencer takes the basic tenets of the Muslim faith that we read and hear about through the liberal media and smashes them to smithereens with ease and fortitude.  He asserts that the Islam is a thoroughly violent religion, oppressive to women and close-minded to all other systems of belief; quite the opposite in the perception that we have been given.  To believe that Islam is a peaceful religion and that Muslims get a bad name because of a small sect of fanatics, who are pumped up by the media, thus translating into a gross generalization about Muslims in general.  <br /> <br />Spencer says otherwise.  He takes a particular interest in addressing the Crusades.  He sets up the PC Myths first; that the Crusades were an attempt by White European Catholics, eager for Christian Imperialism, driven by greed and the need for glory, set out from their homeland to convert or kill the peaceful and enlightened Muslims.  That's the myth.  He turns it around and asserts that the Crusades were really a reaction to the 400+ years that Christians were getting persecuted by Muslims.  It tends to make sense that it would be that, as Islam spread violently throughout Asia, North Africa, and spilled over to Spain, only to be supressed by Charles Martel at the Battle Of Tours in the 700's. <br /> <br />Were the Christians right to Crusade to the \\"Holy Land?\\"  That's probably not the right question to ask in regards to this book.  Spencer is attempting to take off the veil off Islam as a peaceful religion and reveal it for what it is, a violent, repressive religion, intolerant of every thing else, whose followers are told to kill all infidels in order that they might earn their salvation.  That is the point that Spencer tries to drive home, and he succeeds.  Is he right?  Is what he is saying valid?  Is his book borne out of hatred and spite, or is it borne out of frustration that the truth is not being told about the Islamicfaith?  I suppose that spite is triggered by the frustration, and that is what we are reading.  The book is littered with lowblows at the Islamic faith, but, they do not come completely undeserved.  In a country where Islam, like Christianity, is secularized, this book will probably raise eyebrows to most for it's bold assertions.  But, they cannot be dismissed, because his assertions are backed by reasons and are illustrated by defining examples.  John Spencer has taken the veil off of Islam by retracing it from it's origins and revealing that it has never changed from one century to the next.  So that can be seen with events like 9/11.  Christians didn't do that, Muslims did.
B000058B2W|5.0|Whoever this Alan Niester is, his tarring and feathering of this Procol Harum album (CD) did not hold up then and does not hold up now.  The man is quite frankly full of Shiite. I do not know what version of Exotic Bird and Fruit he was listening to but given what things were back then, I am sure something clouded his tastes at that particular moment in his own psychedelic time warp...    **************************************************************    Exotic Birds and Fruit: Procol Harum (Chrysalis CHT 1058): Alan Niester in Rolling Stone, 20 June 1974    Exotic Birds and Fruit is another slab of false majesty for which this band has become noted: elephantine, grandiose production, pretentious, empty lyrics and the sort of artistic posturing that would embarrass Ted Baxter.     Except for the bouncy Nothing but the Truth, every cut on the album has been heard at least twice already - and wasn't that interesting the first time around. The last sign of any vitality or originality in the band was heard on Broken Barricades; even the syphilitic attempts at humor attempted in Grand Hotel are now missing. Procol Harum is a perfect example of a band that has outlived its usefulness, and even staunch fans will undoubtedly be disappointed by this latest effort.     *************************************************************    This is a classic example of why it is so important to read a host of reviews and not any one from some supposed credible source in a rock magazine. Held true then, holds true now.    ********************************************************************  ********************************************************************    \\"More on\\" Alan Neister - several years later and still can't understand which album Niester was listening to or reviewing.  I can usually walk away from differences in opinion on stuff I either like or do not, but not this time.  This one is like confusing solid gold with pyrite and swearing to know the difference by writing a review about it in Rolling Stone!
B000002UAC|5.0|The above description relates to how I really got into this LP . We were in someone's lounge room , right in front of the record player and we flipped this over and over and kept on dancing . We all know that the Beatles could make you feel all sorts of different ways ( they certainly did that in the U.S . Bible Belt after John made a remark ) . <br />This is a feel good record . <br /> <br />Some would call this a transitional record - after all , their next LP would be all original tunes ( A HARD DAY'S NIGHT ). <br /> <br />This is the one for partying to , though . It has only a couple of slower tunes , so you can relax a bit . The songs the band \\"cover\\" are done so well that if you didn't know better you may think they were originals . <br /> <br />To be played loud - I dare you to put it on in a room full of people and not get them grooving !
B0000WN0ZK|1.0|Unlike other reviewers, I was not impressed with this movie in the least.<br /><br />There are some people out there who are philosophical and theoretical. They are deep thinkers who spend time considering the issues both political and moral of the day.<br /><br />And then, there are people such as the writer or writers of this movie, who become existential about defecating but really aren't especially deep thinkers; they just like to think they are.<br /><br />Perhaps this movie was too artsy for my taste, but I thought that it left the viewer to have to decide for him or herself what was going on in each scene. There was far too much symbolism and meaning in this movie and not enough substance.<br /><br />This movie might have made a good point about life and reality had it not been written and produced by people that were too wrapped up in how cool they thought they were. While not a total waste of DVD (like DVD sets of the show 7th Heaven), \\"Blowup\\" is totally lame.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|A delightful sampling of my favorite Beatle songs from throughout their amazing career. Each of these is a cherished melody with beloved lyrics from the masters of classic rock.
B0000C8AVX|5.0|Bringig It All Back Home and Highway Sixty-One were, lyrically, the high points of Bob's career. Bringing It All Back Home is the best record he ever made. Why? The clever wordplay all over the record. Every song but one (She Belongs To Me) has great lyrics. This also features a couple of my all-time favorite Dylan songs: the hard-rockin' Subterranean Homesick Blues, the laugh-out-loud hilarious Bob Dylan's 115th Dream (my favorite Bob Dylan song), the surreal Gates of Eden, the pitch-black It's All Right Ma (I'm Only Bleeding) and the nonsensical It's All Over Now Baby Blue. Some of the lesser-known numbers, such as Outlaw Blues and On the Road Again, definitley can hold their own. And, of course, we have Mr. Tambourine Man and Maggie's Farm. Love Minus Zero/No Limit (Great title!) would be better if it weren't so repetitive. The only bad number is She Belongs to Me, the dumb song does nothing for me. But other than that, this is a great record reccomended for all.
1577314808|5.0|There's not much to say about this beautiful philosophy. I notice that critics of the book are coming from their outer, critical minds. Listen - really listen - with your inner body, not your mind. The vibration of the idea is exquisite. I recommend the audio version as well. Tolle's voice is perfect for his subject. My life is better already, just for having listened.  Thank you, Master Eckhart Tolle.
0743243153|5.0|This book starts off with a reality check:  Life is hard, so.... <br />A fascinating read for anyone interested in a spiritual journey.  I thoroughly recommend this book and another brilliant book, Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self if you are truly interested in being your best self and making the most of your life.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I really love this album right here... It's got everything a metal band should have in it. This is their best album right here, and most people will agree as you can see by other types of reviews people have posted. Slipknot try something new by adding accoustic influences on their album. It works out rather nicely giving a few songs a unique rhythm. It sorta makes this two albums in one. One is the heavy side of Slipknot. The other is the soft side of Slipknot ( Prelude 3.0, Circle, Vermillion Pt.2, and Danger - Keep Away). I like the soft side of Slipknot they should do more of it.    Song ratings and some ect (1 out of  10 rating)    1. Prelude 3.0: 9/10 This is their best album introduction and it's not less than a minute which is what most of their intros are like :D. I love where it says \\" Now it's over\\". The album is just beggining though not ending.    2. The Blisters Exist: 7/10: This song is pretty good.. rolls by fast .. it's just hard to understand the lyrics is all.. but ya gotta give it credit for the good beat on the drums :D    3.Three Nil: 10/10: This song took me awhile to like... but soon afterwards I found the lyrics easy to understand.. I was headbanging like crazy \\" today I said good bye!!!\\"  It's nice and loud just the way it should be when it comes to Slipknot!!    4. Duality: 8/10: I know someone who listens to this song for hours... and that tells ya a lot about this song ... It's a single obviously well known... Lyrics are easy to understand, ya gotta love the \\" push my fingers into my eyes\\" part. The drums on here sound like earthquakes.    5. Opium Of The People: 10/10 This song never became old nor boring to me everytime I listened to it... it might be because it never slows down it's just a nice fast song but not too fast :P    6. Circle: 10/10 Very different... when you understand the lyrics you know why the song is called Circle... because it's basicly like a circle of emotions. The instruments in the song make it sound like an engine literally. Very beautiful.    7.Welcome: 7/10 Loudest song on the album... and it's very good.. only problem is the lyrics are a tad messed up on timing.. nothin much to say about it.    8. Vermillion: 10/10 Very good song about cheating. The beggining of this song's instruments remind me of arabian type music... rest of it's pretty heavy, not to mention how loud Corey screams near the end of the song. Omg it was VERY loud I can tell ya that one right now    9. Pulse Of The Maggots : 10/10 Yes I understand Corey I'll give it a 10 therefore... This song was dedicated for all of Slipknot's fans. Were all maggots!!!!! Do You understand, YESSSS!!!! I understand!!    10. Before I Forget: 10/10 This is without a doubt my favorite song on the album. I mean who woundn't love this song! The chorus OWNS... It's a single so go and listen to it if you aren't even going to buy this... I bet you'll be begging for more whenever you do..    11. Vermillion Pt.2:  6/10 Well it's not bad... just wasn't heavy enough for me... but still it's pretty good when ya think about it... made me shed a few tears cause this song made me think of my ex.... why.... well it's lyrics are just like the first one... but I think the first was better...    12. The Nameless: 10/10 Very good song right here baby... The only thing I ever really loved after listening to this song, was hate! In fact that's what the song was about... all those hating emotions with the loud banging music.. you can feel the hate    13. The Virus Of Life: 8/10 Very good song for a slow song... it talks about a virus... and it gets creepier by each minute that passes..  in the end... well find out for yourself (this is the albums longest song)    14. Danger - Keep Away: 10/10 I found the song's loud sound giving me a headache first 3 times I listened to it. Once I got used to it though I ended up enjoying this song so much. A great way to close this maniac house by taming the lion.    Well as you can tell it's a very good album... I hope you get it.. if not then atleast get the song Before I Forget cause that song is without a doubt their best one on that album.
B00000JNNY|5.0|Etta James has got to be one of the most under-rated singers, I have only just come across her, what a voice!
B00005A46T|3.0|First of all this right here is Slipknot's most graphic album so if you don't like cussing best not get this album. But if your ears can handle some of the hardest screaming you'll probably ever here in your life, then get ready cause this album is just waiting for you (espicially if your a nu metal fan).  Here's how I rate the songs.<br />  Ratings go from 1 to 10 1 worse 10 best<br /><br />1. (515): 3/10 Well it's an ok song if you would call it that.<br /><br />2. People = (censored): 10/10 Well after that.. umm... wierd song..  it starts to get interesting... this song here is awesome and tells you why people (ourselves) are completely messed up... of course there's all sorts of reasons why were the song title.. Pollution, deforestation, cruelness, causing problems for other animals survival.. but anyways you get the point this song ROCKS and it's really fast to :D<br /><br />3. Disasterpiece: 8/10: This song rules... espicially with how it starts.. \\" I wanna slit your throat and **** the wound\\" I love that part so much.<br /><br />4. My Plague: 8/10 Very good song.. it's fast.. just very vulgar with the lyrics seeming to be off timing... But in the end you'll feel like ripping someone apart.<br /><br />5. Everything Ends: 10/10 Wow... This song always reminds me of people I hate... and for good reason to.. it goes like this \\" you are all ****** and over rated think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault. This is the end of everything. You are the end of everything\\" This song right here is a must listen for a Slipknot fan!<br /><br />6. The Heretic Anthem: 10/10 This is the best song off the album I can tell you that one right now... IT RULES, while it's a tad wierd with the numbers to, but in a very good way! If your the 555 then I'm the 666!!! It feels good to be the 666 .. and your definitly the 555 if you haven't listened to it.<br /><br />Songs after The Heretic Anthem aren't as good but are still worth a listen :)<br /><br />7. Gently 7/10: Pretty getle song but makes up for it by a very good beat...<br /><br />8. Left Behind 9/10: This song took me a few listens to like but afterwords I love it... it's a good song for someone who feels lonely like me. But then again... WE ALL GOT LEFT BEHIND!<br /><br />9. The Shape 7/10: Very good song... not their best but very good... I liked the ending part of the song where Corey starts saying \\" It's not a word it's a problem and the problem is easy\\" then he starts singing about it and making us look like were dumb.<br /><br />10. I Am Hated 10/10: This is my second favorite song on this album.. IT RULES AND YOU CAN FEEL THE HATRED IN THIS SONG... It's one of the fastest and shortest song that the band has made. Defintly worth a listen. Reminds me of thrash metal Slipknot style.<br /><br />11. Skin Ticket: 5/10 This song just gets old.. and it's very long to... it's ok the first few times you listen to it I'll give it that... in the end you'll find it drowns... not much lyrics to it also, just says the same thing over and over.<br /><br />12. New Abortion: 5/10 Not bad just difficult to understand...<br /><br />13. Metabolic: 6/10 Not bad also it's just missing something it feels like ... but I do like the chorus .... \\" I'm almost ready to die but your killing me\\" gotta love that part if anything at all in this song.<br /><br />14. Iowa: 7/10 Pretty great song. I have the line \\"all that remains\\" stuck in my head. I skip past the city sounds part, pretty decent closure.<br /><br />So in other words most of the songs are pretty good and this album is worth getting, espicially if your a diehard Slipknot fan. I'd get this last though. Also if your feeling like you want to become a metal fan and want to kick it up a knotch in heavyness (yes believe it or not there is heavier bands than Slipknot) check out Children Of Bodom, Devildriver, Opeth, In Flames, and perhaps even Dimmu Borgir. You will love them I promise you that.: This song took me a few listens to like but afterwords I love it... it's a good song for someone who feels lonely like me. But then again... WE ALL GOT LEFT BEHIND!    9. The Shape 7/10: Very good song... not their best but very good... I liked the ending part of the song where Corey starts saying \\" It's not a word it's a problem and the problem is easy\\" then he starts singing about it and making us look like were dumb.    10. I Am Hated 10/10: This is my second favorite song on this album.. IT RULES AND YOU CAN FEEL THE HATRED IN THIS SONG... It's one of the fastest and shortest song that the band has made. Defintly worth a listen. Reminds me of thrash metal Slipknot style.    11. Skin Ticket: 5/10 This song just gets old.. and it's very long to... it's ok the first few times you listen to it I'll give it that... in the end you'll find it drowns... not much lyrics to it also, just says the same thing over and over.    12. New Abortion: 5/10 Not bad just difficult to understand...    13. Metabolic: 6/10 Not bad also it's just missing something it feels like ... but I do like the chorus .... \\" I'm almost ready to die but your killing me\\" gotta love that part if anything at all in this song.    14. Iowa: 7/10 Pretty great song. I have the line \\"all that remains\\" stuck in my head. I skip past the city sounds part, pretty decent closure.    So in other words most of the songs are pretty good and this album is worth getting, espicially if your a diehard Slipknot fan. I'd get this last though. Also if your feeling like you want to become a metal fan and want to kick it up a knotch in heavyness (yes believe it or not there is heavier bands than Slipknot) check out Children Of Bodom, Devildriver, Opeth, In Flames, and perhaps even Dimmu Borgir. You will love them I promise you that.
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|One of the great advantages of having loved ones and friends (actually that last part is superfluous; true friends Are loved ones, even though it's not in vogue to say it in this day and age) into movies as much as you are is that you end up getting drawn into watching movies they're excited about that you probably never would have gone and gotten yourself.  This is what happened to me with \\"Shall We Dance?\\", a great soft comedy that uses ballroom dancing as its vehicle for making the point that it's just not enough to be alive, you have to Live.  Just going through the motions of life but having lost the enthusiasm is the position the Richard Gere character finds himself in, with a life that's perfectly comfortable but lacking the spark.  He ends up taking a chance on something very out of character for him, clandestinely signing up for a dance class.  Any vehicle for conveying the message could have worked, but I'm glad they chose the dance motif; a ballroom dancing movie is so different from what I usually watch that that's part of what made it so great.  Genuinely funny, with a great cast of characters and the pleasure of watching unexpected relationships form (both romantic and non-romantic; the many different ways in which people can be close is another theme of this movie) and great performances from Gere, Jennifer Lopez, Susan Sarandon, Omar Miller, and the whole cast in fact, but with the show-stealing performance coming from Stanley Tucci.  Plentiful hot girls for all us guys to oogle, and the ladies will likely be enchanted with Gere's prescence.  An uexpectedly great movie.
0812550706|2.0|Ender's Game is not just about games and strategy, and it is not good clean fun for young readers.  This book includes violent scenes of a child killing other children, twice, and also includes one graphic sexual moment.  If you are raising your children to be caring and sensitive, stay away from this book.  It was somewhat entertaining for an adult, with an interesting plot, but shallow and unbelievable characters, sub-plots so outlandish as to be insulting, a ridiculous foe in the \\"buggers\\" and literally no satisfying ending.  I'm sure it will make a blockbuster movie.

0321334876|2.0|People who say this book is great, are those who haven't read or heard of \\" Thinking in C++ \\" by Bruce Eckel. There are two volumes in that book I and II. I will say Effective C++ is a good book, but definitely not worth its price. Thinking in C++ is free ( can't believe it ). Download it for yourself and read both volumes. If you really want to spend money, they I would suggest \\" More Effective C++: 35 New ways \\" is something you should buy. That's exactly what I did. I have both volumes of Thinking in C++ and the 35 new ways book. That serves the purpose. You will thank me later on. I have over 5 years of experience in C++ with a BS, MS in Computer Science. Once again go download Thinking in C++.I loved it.
B0000542D2|3.0|I was 13 when the Beatles came to America, just the right age to be right in the middle of Beatlemania.  I really loved the Beatles then.  So did all the kids.<br /><br />My favorite part of this movie is the end, the performance.  It was great to see all the screaming girls again.  They were so emotional, so overcome.  It's hard to believe.  But it was true.  That's exactly how it was.<br /><br />I don't know what was going on back then.  I don't understand why a million girls screamed their heads off for these guys.  It was mass hysteria, but it was mass love too.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is amusing, not sensational.  The part of it that I found weakest was the short guy who acted so bossy with them.  What was his deal?  Why would they have him around?<br /><br />I think the movie would have had more of an impact if they didn't just play us the album cuts, straight off the record.  It would have been a lot more powerful if they had given us a live version of all the songs.  It would have made the songs fresh and new, despite their being old.  How many hundreds of times have I heard those exact versions note for note.  Even so, at one point one of the songs started feeling hypnotic to me, and strong again.  It's odd that something like that would happen with a song I've heard 1200 times.

B0009S4IHY|5.0|The fun in watching \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" is picking up on the inferences to other films and genres both Eastern and Western.  This is not to say that director Stephen Chow's film is a collage of other styles because he adds some of his own original fluorishes to make this a highly original work.  The title of the film is kind of a paradox because it renders in your mind a polination of seventies Kung Fu and black exploitation films which may have partially influenced Chow but not wholly.  It would also be easy to characterize this film as a parody or a satire of martial arts films but Chow has such an affinity for those films that it holds it's own with them.  Chow hits a homerun here wearing the multiple hats of actor, director, and writer.  His script is rich with characterization and the story takes enough nifty twists that it would be a disservice to reveal them here.  Where he really excels is as a visualist in both action and art direction.  Before you can say, \\"What was that?\\", another imaginative sight penetrates the screen.  If you have reservations about martial arts films and you must see one this it.
B00000099Y|5.0|I can relate to the idea that Tool are geniuses, around a year or two ago I thought about the same thing. I can also relate to the idea that they are overrated and extremely pretentious (they definitely are pretentious) but for this review I will ignore these two things. <br /> <br />Quite frankly, AEnima is everything you could ask for in an alternative metal album. <br /> <br />-Talent/Complexity. Check. (HUGE check for Danny Carrey) <br />-Dark. Check. <br />-Angry. Check. <br />-Pretentious. Check. <br />-Twinge of humor. Check. <br /> <br />Add this to the fact that you *cannot* argue that Maynard has a great voice, you get a great album. True it is pretentious and too many people hail Tool for being geniuses when they really just have abstract lyrics and odd interludes, but this is a great album. <br />

B000A6T1KE|4.0|It was just a couple of years ago that Star Trek Nemesis, featuring the final journey of the next generation crew was released on DVD. Featuring the music of the late veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith, it tells the story of how the Enterprise-E, led by Captain Picard is invited by the Romulans to commence final peace negotiations. Unfortunately it is all a ploy by a younger clone of Captain Picard to not only cripple the Federation but exterminate Earth altogether using their new weapon. The weapon is stored aboard Shinzon's ultra-predator-battleship that carries enough photon torpedoes to take out entire fleets of starships, and a perfect cloaking device making it possible to fire in perfect invisibility- unlike the klingon ship from Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country that had a flaw. Complicating circumstances is the discovery of a prototype android of the Enterprise's Lt Commander Data.<br /><br />There is definitely a sense of goodbye with this film, and although Star Trek Nemesis may not be the final Star Trek movie, it is most likely the final next generation movie. Partings in this film, as well as the loss of a beloved member of our senior crew, include Dr Beverly Crusher who is transferring to Starfleet Medical (as she did in Season 2 of Star Trek The Next Generation), Riker who at last has accepted his promotion to Captain and is taking command of another starship, and Counselor Deanna Troi who is going with him as his wife. In this final next generation movie we also get to see Lt Commander Worf who though leaving to be an ambassador at the end of Star Trek Deep Space Nine has returned to the Enterprise crew. Other minor appearances include Janeway who was promoted to Admiral after leading the crew from Star Trek Voyager home, Guinan who was last seen in Star Trek Generations and Wesley Crusher who we haven't seen since the final season of Star Trek The Next Generation.<br /><br />As for my summary of the whole movie itself- I like it. Quite a few fans have berated it but I like it very much. Despite not being the most original story (just one ship battle really), the dark atmosphere (the darkest for a Star Trek movie to date) really takes our characters into genuine unknown territory. I'm also glad that some of the cheap jokes aimed at the very oldest of Star Trek fans is kept to a minimum here. A negative and a positive about Star Trek Nemesis is the realization of how old our crew have been getting, and indeed how Star Trek itself is. I think the biggest mistake was when the villain of Star Trek Insurrection referred to the Federation as being old. Star Trek is the Federation, and that reference makes Star Trek seem tired. I think that whole thought has connected with viewers, and quite possibly affected the success of Star Trek Nemesis, as well as the final season of Star Trek Deep Space Nine, the last three seasons of Star Trek Voyager, and most definitely the whole of Star Trek Enterprise. I hope that one day the producers of Star Trek move even further along in the Star Trek timeline to an all-new more positive future.<br /><br />So now we have the new 2 Disc collectors edition of Star Trek Nemesis. New special features exclusive to this edition include the movie in more impactful DTS sound, an audio commentary by the man who has continued Star Trek within the 24th Century- Producer Rick Berman and a text commentary- regular to the collectors edition DVDs. New Production featurettes include Nemesis Revisited, Storyboarding the action, Build and rebuild, Four-Wheeling in the Final Frontier, Shinzon screen test. There are new Star Trek Universe featurettes including A Bold Vision of the Final Frontier, and The Enterprise-E. We also have featurettes studying the Romulan Empire including Romulan Lore, Shinzon & the Viceroy, Romulan Design, The Romulan Senate, The Scimitar. Other special features include new deleted scenes and trailers.<br /><br />Special features from the first Star Trek Nemesis DVD are also included.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a fitting end for the next generation crew. Some may love this movie, some may not, but either way, it's time to end the journey of the next generation and this is indeed, the end.is a fitting end for the next generation crew. Some may love this movie, some may not, but either way, it's time to end the journey of the next generation and this is indeed, the end.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie was awful.  No story line, blatant metaphors about being alone even though surrounded by people.  This could have been an important movie about finding friends when you least expect it or how people become so easily lost within and unhappy with their lives......I like independent \\"artsy\\" films BUT obviously the only reason this one got so much industry attention was because WHO the writer and director is.  We can all hope she actually develops some talent instead of riding on her family name.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|As the mainstream continues to pump out the pre-fab hip-hop, non-threating punk rock, and shamefully insincere pop, and just when you feel like all of indi-rocks hopes and dreams are fading. Along comes Arcade Fire. I don't know what they put in the water in Canada, but latley some really amazing music has come out of there. Arcade Fire is at the very top of that list and is without question the best thing to happen to music since modest mouse. Funeral is that oh so rare album that transends generas and changes everything.  <br /> <br />\\"Wake UP\\" is that perfect little song every kind needs to here before they grow up and let the world suck them under.  <br /> <br />\\"Tunnels\\" A fantastic number that makes you feel like you're 12 again, and then makes you feel good becasue you're not.  <br /> <br />\\"Power Out\\" is a pice of pure joy, build upon build that seems to flow so perfectly John Lennon would have loved it.  <br /> <br />\\"Crown of Love\\" will make you wan't to cut your ear off and send it to that special someone. Dear god it's hauntily beautiful. <br /> <br />This is getting far too long. Simply put, this band is the best thing to happen to music in ages. Yes, the are brilliant live, but part of the reason why is that their live shows sound just as perfect as their album does. I cannot think of a single band (OK maybe Modest Mouse) that I can say that about. It's sad that how often personal tragedy creates such amazing music, but for some, unknow reason it does. And, we as and audience, are left feeling better for it. If you don't like this album you have no soul. I suggest Candy Shop by 50 Cent would probably be right up your alley. Oh and if you bring up Pavement, the Pixies, or any other \\"Old School\\" indie band, get over it, move on, and accept that fact that these guys and girls have something really special.

0393312836|5.0|This novel is well known, owing mostly to Kubrick's masterwork with the same title that is a filmic translation from it. What is less identifiable through the movie is that these young men speak using a lot of Russian words, intermingled in the English ones, and written using an unorthodox spelling that, however, allows the English-speaking reader to read them correctly without knowing their real pronunciation. This technique creates a strange form of slang that was the subject of articles, books and also a dictionary. It envisions an (impossible) context in which a hooligan can be well educated. I think that this is the feature that mostly distinguishes this very interesting novel. Not all the readers can, however, understands all the ins and outs of it.
0380789019|4.0|Neverwhere was a good read that kept me interested and engaged.  For those who haven't read other descriptions, it's the story of Average Guy, Richard Mayhew, who helps a mysterious girl named Door and suddenly finds himself to be a part of a darker, more dangerous world.  Richard, of course,  is utterly out of his element and is played the fool in the book, where even the younger Door is wiser than he.  Some remarkably good bits of humor came from this, too, though this is accomplished without making Richard into pure comic relief.  Other characters include the mysterious marquis de Carabas, warrior woman Hunter, and, of course, the two cronies Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar.  Though they were the \\"bad guys\\", I have to say that I enjoyed them the most and found them to be the best-written characters.  Richard and Door, while having sufficient characterization to get by, could have used a bit more depth; at times Richard appears almost two-dimensional with his average-ness, and for someone whose family was recently murdered, Door seems to be rather cheerful most of the time.  There are also a few minor characters in the novel that I would have liked to have seen more of, but it appears that time and the plot did not permit.   <br /> <br />That is another thing.  Gaiman has good bones for a story here, but a little more development couldn't have hurt him.  The novel read almost too fast when I wouldn't have minded more at all.  But this is me as a writer and ficiton-fan thinking of untapped potential.  I don't think that there is a sequel to this book, but it just cries out for one, especially with the fact that several things were left open-ended, seemingly intentionally.  But all of these critisims are because I liked the book.   <br /> <br />This is a book where the characters dance on the edge of reality, opening doors where there are none and for a large part, living in a darker, more fantastic world of myth and magic.  This makes it a vague and otherworldly book, but don't let this scare you away.  Gaiman's dark sense of humor gives it the firm footing that it might otherwise lack.  It's part of what makes the book work, and also what made me keep turning the pages. <br /> <br />And Gaiman is very funny.  There were times when I literally laughed out loud, because the images presented were so ridiculous and yet somehow worked perfectly in this place that is London Below. <br /> <br />The plot is simple and uncomplicated, and again, here there are hints that there could be more.  IF you're willing to accept that there isn't, and enjoy a good read, pick it up.

0808519387|5.0|This is a wonderful work of fiction, by a wonderful author.  Be warned, however, that Rand's philosophy (which she introduces in this book) while brilliant and original, is extremist and close-minded.  To put it another way, Rand believed in The One Truth, and she thought that this was The Only Truth, and held it above all other truths.  Moral issues like abortion, religion, gay marriage, etc... they all fade against the background of the objectivist philosophy.  It's a philosophy about one thing, really: man and his right to be free, as an original, individual being.  Therefore, this book preaches selflessness.  Many people find it offensive, so be warned. <br /> <br />I myself found objectivism to be refreshing at first because I had never read anything like it.  Whatever else you say about Rand, it took guts to stand up and preach as moral something that for centuries upon centuries had been considered immoral.  And while I wouldn't opt for going as far as Howard Roark did in a few instances in this book (which I won't mention because the ones I think of would spoil it for you), I will say that it made me reconsider my own life, and this reconsideration yielded instances that were ultimately liberating, not having to always consider other people, or feel guilty about doing things for myself. <br /> <br />Well, enough about objectivism, and on to the book itself.  If you find you can tolerate/sometimes like the philosophy (some people say it makes them gag) then you will likely enjoy the fiction.  This stands on its own as a work of ficiton.  Rand's descriptions are vivid, and her use of language is simply remarkable.  I couldn't believe it when I first discovered that English wasn't her first language. <br /> <br />As for the characters, they are unconventional, and act in unconventional ways, based upon Rand's odd view of the world.  It's all epic struggle, disguised and re-disguised into everyday life.  The smallest action has philisophical meaning.  When you get down to it, you really can't get away from the philosophy.
6305095442|5.0|Nowadays, the American horror film is raking it in at the box office.  Or so it would appear to the casual observer.  Truth be told, the genre is under siege at all fronts.  It seems like every horror film coming out anymore is a sequel, an inferior adaptation of a J-horror hit, a far inferior remake of a 1970s classic, or just plain garbage (_Godsend_ anyone?).<br /><br />_Evil Dead 2_ from 1987 was guilty of none of the above.  It wasn't even a sequel so much as it was a complete reworking of the 1983 underground cult classic _The Evil Dead_.  While at times the 1983 version suffered because of its extremely low budget, it was undeniable that it possessed a fire and energy that is absent in just about every $100 million (or more)  produced film out there.  Not to mention director Sam Raimi was only 24 years old at the time.  _ED2_ was the version that Raimi and actor Bruce Campbell wanted to make since they had more money to their disposal.<br /><br />The end result turned out to be unquestionably one of the greatest horror films of all time.  It is a wild thrill ride from beginning to end that was wholly unlike anything that came out before it, including its predecessor.  While the combination of horror and comedy was nothing new at the time, it was almost never done with such pinache.  The viewer was treated with dancing demon zombies, Campbell being thrown around like a baseball during spring training, and an epic battle between Campbell and his right hand.  All of which has to seen to be believed.<br /><br />The 1993 film _Army of Darkness_ was the first true sequel of the _ED_ franchise.  It takes the lesser chosen route of sequelization by continuing the story instead of recycling it.  It saddens me to think that that may be the last _ED_ film because of Raimi's success with _Spiderman_.  Don't get me wrong here, I enjoy the _Spiderman_ films.  I'm not going to call Raimi a \\"sellout\\" or anything else derogatory because I believe that he dreamed of making such films his entire life.  I feel his success couldn't have happened to a better director.  It's just that in times like these when originality and energetic filmmaking is lacking in modern horror (well actually any genre today), we need another _ED_ film.  Until, that happens, I'm just going to hope I'm wrong.e.  I feel his success couldn't have happened to a better director.

B00006JU7T|5.0|Al Pacino's performance as idealistic New York cop Frank Serpico not only ranks as one of the great actor's definitive performances, but the film itself is one of the defining films of the 70's.  Based on a true account of a clean cop trying to stay that way in a sea of corruption, director Sidney Lumet portrays Serpico as a man searching for justice to the brink of obsession, costing him everything from his lover, his career, and nearly his life, in the process.  Though he was robbed of an Oscar for Best Actor, Pacino is unbelievably brilliant as he displays all the strengths and vulnerabilities of the title character.  His performance alone makes Serpico one of the finest crime/cop films of the 20th century, and is worth the price of admission alone.  Future Oscar winner (and later Scarface co-star with Pacino) F. Murray Abraham appears briefly as a sleazy detective who plays a pivotal role, and TV's Taxi star Judd Hirsch can be seen in a blink and you'll miss him role as a cop at the hospital.
0767836286|4.0|Arlington Road is a great thriller.  The ending was somewhat predictable, but the rest of the movie is worth the price of admission.  Jeff Bridges is great as the paranoid widower.  He is an expert on native born terrorism who is haunted by the death of his FBI wife.  But, Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack as the happy, creepy, couple next door really make this movie.  And those Hitler Youth kids don't hurt either.  This film does cause the viewer to ask some interesting questions about privacy, a person's past, and how we are all affected by laws like the Patriot Act.

0975991477|1.0|Unless you're an avid reader of scientific jargon and theory, save your money.  At best, this book is misleading; at worst, it borders on scam.    Most readers, like me, are searching for answers:  what is the meaning of Dr. Lipton's miraculous discovery?  How can I apply it to my life?  How can it help me change my beliefs - for that is what the complete title implies:  \\"The Biology of Belief:  Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter & Miracles.\\"    Readers should be aware that Lipton's breakthrough \\"discovery\\" occurred as the result of emotional upheavals in his life that drove him to teach biology at an offshore university that specializes in accepting medical students who can't qualify for American medical universities.  A misfit teaching misfits.    I'm not a scientist, so I have no way of knowing if the scientific \\"proof\\" he presents is proof or hyperbole.  Although it's nice to know his wonderful and exciting discovery has a basis in what he presents as scientific fact, as a layperson I just want to know how I can apply what he learned to my own life.    Halfway through the book, he was still spouting scientific jargon, explaining and re-explaining.  About that time I confess I started to skim, as the suspicion grew that he had no intention of answering my pressing question.  Okay, Dr. Lipton, this scientific stuff is all well and good - but what's your point?    He doesn't state his point until after the end of the book - in the Addendum:  \\"I use PSYCH-K in my own life. . . I believe PSYCH-K represents an important step toward the New Psychology for the 21st century, and beyond.  You can find more information about PSYCH-K at Rob's web site:  [...].\\"    That, my friends, is his answer to changing your beliefs:  Rob Williams' PSYCH-K.  Ah, but visit the website and you'll find no hint as to how to apply these wondrous techniques!  No, you have to take a class that costs around $350.    Neat, huh?    P. T. Barnum said there's a fool born every minute.  I was the fool for falling for the hype and ordering the book.  Don't make the same mistake.
6304708491|5.0|It is a pleasure to watch The Beatle's film \\"Help.\\" It's easy listening, lighthearted  and a nice \\"snapshot\\" in time when they were all enjoying being at the top of their game! All the songs featured were big hits and are well woven into the framework of the movie. Nevertheless, to have another opportunity to experience the dry subtle humor of John Lennon is worth the purchase on it's own! But to know that this was one of the first exposures of Indian music for George Harrison, and to witness this milestone that influenced the rest of his musical and spiritual life, is an extremely rare treat indeed. Ringo Starr continues to entertain with his own brand of whimsical laconicism that remains unequaled and Paul McCartney is very warmly enjoyable in his portrayal of a love-struck member of the band with the lovely leading High Priestess. A must see for new and renewed fans alike!

Grisham just hits on all levels with this book. <br /> <br />You can't help but root for Rudy, as he is the ultimate underdog, whose life is unraveling at the begining of the book. While that idea is rather cliche when it comes to books, the way the story develops and progresses quite entertaining. You'll have trouble putting this book down after you've read the first 50 pages. Pick this book up, and you won't be disappointed.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I have never heard such a powerful album before.  The lyrics are absolutely breathtaking, not to mention very rare these days.  It's great for just relaxing, meditating, or for a thrill.  A Perfect Circle is absolutely awesome!  1)The Package:4/5-Very creepy opening track.  About a guy who wants to steal something from another person. We don't know what.    2)Weak and Powerless:4/5-Good song.  The singer is desperate over someone.    3)Noose:4/5-One of the most unique songs in the album.  Something about an angel's halo coming down to choke him.    4)Blue:5/5-One of my favorite tracks.  The singer praises the color blue in this one.    5)Vanishing:5/5-Another good track.  The singer wants to disappear in this one.    6)A Stranger:5/5-Very mellow track, but very cool also.  Sings about a girl running from her fears.    7)The Outsider:4/5-Pretty good one.  It sings about a father wanting the best for his daughter.    8)Crimes:5/5-Cool song.  No real lyrics.  The singer just counts to the number 10.    9)The Nurse Who Loved Me:4/5-Another mellow and unique track.  The song name pretty much explains the song itself.  About a nurse the singer is in love with.    10)Pet:10/5- My favorite song!  Great electric guitar in this song and a perfect mix of heaviness and mellowness at the same time!  Sings about a father protecting his daughter from enemies.    11)Lullaby:4/5-Not the most interesting track, but still cool.  Just a light remix of Pet.    12)Gravity:5/5-Cool ending song.  Talks about how gravity takes the singer away.
0060594888|1.0|This book will NOT change your life. Only YOU can do that. If Canfield, or some other author can help you realize what you really want to do, and then help you develop the ability, courage, intelligence, and self-discipline to achieve your goals then that's great! Most self-help books don't work because many people already know what they need to do to make themselves happy, and they just haven't found the courage and determination to do it. If you are in denial about who you are, and what you really want out of life, then this book will NOT help you.<br /><br />Your goals must be consistent with who you are as a person, what is important to you, and what you believe. Once you truly understand and accept what these are, then you can make them happen, with or without this book.<br /><br />By all means read this book, and read many other similar books, but know that it will always be 'your' responsibility to do what is right for 'you'. There is no magic pill that can change your life.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|This is a great movie. However don't buy this version get the Chinese import (search the web you'll find it). <br />Not only is it not the full version but it lacks the DTS audio of the import. The DTS track kicks major \\"BUTT\\" and makes the DD 5.1 sound like static. <br />Anyone with a decent home theater setup owes it to themselves to get the DTS audio version
0609610570|3.0|\\"Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done\\" is about creating a culture of focusing on results rather than just strategy.  The first part of the book makes the case for execution in a company, while part 2 looks at how to create a culture of execution, and finally part 3 looks at the 3 processes vital to an \\"execution\\" culture.<br /><br />I found this book to be written at a high level, targeted to CEOs and executive managers.  As a result, I couldn't understand a lot of what the authors were talking about.  However, I enjoyed the examples that they provided and wished they had provided more.<br /><br />I also would have like more diagrams and processes to use in order to create this culture.  Much of the book speaks of the author's experiences, but they don't do a good job of explaining the situation fully.  Unless you have been following these author's lives, this may be difficult for you too.<br /><br />In all, it's an average book.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  If you are a CEO or execution, you may want to skim through this book.  Otherwise, it probably won't hold your interest.  3 out of 5 stars.
B00067BBQE|5.0|I think this DVD is not for Evanescence fans only but also for the people who loves rock and rockstar live. Especially at the last part of the DVD, 1 hour video comes and showes us what is Evanescence in real life. Who they are, what they do, what they like, with goods and bads. It's a great chance for anybody who wants to learn how rock stars work seriously. I really recommend this DVD for all rock lovers.
B000002MFN|5.0|Although not her all-time best album, Erotica is one Hell of an album. Deeper and Deeper is one the best post disco dance tracks to ever hit the air waves. It's simply gorgeous and still stands up today in clubs as one of the best tracks to shake your ass to. Erotica in all it's dirty breathy naughtiness still gets me going. It manages to make Britney's slave 4 u seem like music from Sesame Street. Bad Girl should've been on her ballad collection. Rain is one of her most beautiful songs. Waiting is such a great jazzy track, it deserved to be a single. This album is sexy and will always be that underground Madonna classic. The album that sums up Madonna's career: In your face.

B0007GAERG|1.0|Mariah Carey: Living proof that record sales do not reflect talent. Take the vocals away from this tired album and you've got the basics for every R&B meets pop release in the past year. Mariah Carey lacks the creativity to write songs that sound unique, interesting, or thought provoking. Every song runs together like a never-ending nightmare. If you are a closet-case gay, or a young girl with low self-esteem and braces, this is the record for you. <br />Otherwise, keep Mimi away from YouYou. <br />In addition, the rating system does not offer zero, which this album begs to be given.  <br />For those of you who might not have heard the album, all you have to do is turn to your local top 40 station. It will played intermittantly every hour along with all the rest of the boring fodder that they insist we listen to.
B00005REQR|5.0|This is the start of the \\"Radio Gnome Trilogy\\" in which Daevid Allen and Gong lay out the full mythology of the Planet Gong and the Pothead Pixies. Calling this \\"jazz-rock\\" is completely misleading though it certainly has elements of both. It is the first fully formed expression of the unique sound developed by Gong and used by Daevid and the band to convey profound thoughts in a very silly and beautiful manner. Profoundly psychedelic, this is music intended to be listened to in an altered state, and it is designed to fit together with the following two parts of the trilogy (\\"Angel's Egg\\" and \\"You\\"...both equally essential). Buy all three albums - program them into a CD changer - prepare your head and don headphones - then get ready for a journey you will never regret. This IS \\"Lafta Yoga\\" - Electric Dharma. Hare hare London Bus!!!\\"
0385510438|2.0|Grisham's The Last Juror is a perfect example of a book that means well, but eventually and completely loses its way.  The climax and really only truly effective scene in the book is the murder scene which grabs the reader in the opening pages.  The rest of the book is so anti-climatic that we often wonder exactly where it is all going.  This is not a book I vehemently disliked, but a book that really never served any purpose to me.  It was like a rehash of better, earlier ideas from other stories that you could read about anywhere. <br /> <br />The book, as I mentioned earlier, opens with a devastating murder scene.  A young woman is raped and murdered in front of her two children.  The suspect is quickly apprehended and awaits trial.  The murderer's name is Danny Padgitt.  His family is very influential in the underground crime business.  The murder occurs in the small town of Clayton, Mississippi.  Padgitt is sentenced to a life sentence by a jury and as he leaves the courtroom swearing that someday he will enact his revenge on them. <br /> <br />This sequence occurs in the first third of the novel, but by the way it is marketed, you would swear that this is supposed to be the main plot line.  It isn't.  The story is told first person by Willie Traynor, a normal, long haired young kid who buys the local newspaper in Clayton at the age of only twenty three. <br /> <br />The thick of the story is about him and his success and failures in writing for the newspaper.  The story takes place in the sixties and seventies, and we are given yet another clichd journey through history that really gives no added freshness concerning everything we already know and have read.  Traynor develops a friendship with a black woman named Callie and for some reason the story ends with her.  He meets many other characters as well, but we never really get to know them well and it seems they are thrown in more for show than for substance. <br /> <br />Later in the story, Padgitt is fromprison for good behavior.  Not soon after, a juror is suddenly found dead, followed by another one.  The town is in an uproar and believes that Padgitt must be enacting his revenge on the jurors who sentenced him ten years prior.  There is a slight twist at the end, but then again the book is such an ode to the anti-climax that it does not feel like much of a surprise or a revelation when it comes.  By that point we, as a reader, are daydreaming about the next book we want to read. <br /> <br />I think the main problem, and there are many, with The Last Juror is that the story is written in such a way that we don't really care about it.  The characters are all severely underdeveloped because it seems as if Grisham is trying to do too much here. And it doesn't work.  There are numerous clichs in here as well.  Every lawyer and small town clich you can think of, in fact.   <br /> <br />The Last Juror generates no suspense.  It's funny because it is marketed as a thriller, but with the exception of the first scene, it is dryly told with a level of such mediocrity. This is unusual for a writer as talented as Grisham.  Where was the suspense of The Firm, the intrigue of The Pelican Brief, or the power of A Time to Kill?  It feels like The Last Juror was quickly processed and the Grisham was on auto-pilot when he wrote it and more importantly he puts the reader on auto-pilot as they read it.  It would have been nice if some emotion was stirred up inside of me, but sadly, nothing came.  It was like listening to a tired history lecture from a teacher about events that already knew too well and didn't care much about. <br /> <br />The book did nothing to anger me, it wasn't even particularly boring.  It was just a meandering mess that couldn't find anywhere to go....and when it did find something interesting; it would quickly switch paths to another tired clich.  The Last Juror never could find where it wanted to go and what it wanted to say, so it decided to say everything and nothing through nearly 500 pages (the story could have been told in less than 300).  If you haven't read anything by Grisham, this isn't the place to start, or you might never pick up anything written by him again. <br /> <br />Grade: C
B0009S2T0M|4.0|Imagine the horror:  One day you're walking on a downtown street on your way back from work.  Everything appears normal, until you're suddenly abducted and thrown into a room and locked up in there all by yourself.  You have no idea why, and as each day in your solitary confinement becomes more and more unbearable, the days turn into weeks, the weeks into months, the months into years.  When all is said and done, you've been locked up for 15 years now and you still have no idea why.  Now you're out, and it's payback time...<br /><br />The premise in Oldboy is fascinating and rarely have I seen a movie that made me sympathize so much with its central character.  We as viewers desperately want Oldboy to find out answers and get back at the people who wronged him.  Even if it means watching him commit cringe-inducing acts of violence such as pulling out someone's teeth with a claw hammer.  Yeech!!  Really, it hits home, Oldboy was a previously mild-mannered gent but after being locked up for supposedly no good reason he's out for blood.  Wouldn't you be?<br /><br />Oldboy will no doubt appeal to people seeking graphic violence.  Although there aren't a very high number of such scenes, one stands out as being one of the most entertaining in vigilante-dom history, in which Oldboy is able to take on a group of twenty-or-so thugs all armed with knives and baseball bats and come out victorious.  All by himself.  With his bare hands.  This scene was one of the most ludicrously over-the-top things I've seen since Charles Bronson's antics in the all-time vigilante trash classic \\"Death Wish 3\\".  And the final revelatory scene is shocking beyond belief...<br /><br />But be careful about going into Oldboy thinking it will be one of the best films ever, which is the mistake I did.  Look, I've seen lots of Asian action movies and this one is surely admirable but why is everyone passing this off as the best thing since sliced bread?  It seems downright trendy these days to jump on the Asian film bandwagon and proclaim any good film that comes out of the Orient as being \\"Ultra-Hip\\" and \\"an instant classic\\".  I'm thinking the same people who bestow such overblown praise are the same ones who would tell you that Takashi Miike's \\"Ichi the Killer\\" is also a can't miss classic.  If you ask me, Oldboy is plagued by a lot of the same problems as Ichi, namely a sometimes glacial pace, peppered in with overly gratuitous scenes of torture, a story that lacks cohesion and a run time that far oustretches its concept. So do watch Oldboy because it is a fine film, just don't go into it with overblown expectations after reading the many exaggerated reviews on this website.ump on the Asian film bandwagon and proclaim any good film that comes out of the Orient as being \\"Ultra-Hip\\" and \\"an instant classic\\".

0812550706|5.0|First and foremost, I just cannot see anyone disliking this book.  It is misleading at first (I though that I was going to be reading a The Giver clone), but it quickly changes as Andrew Wiggin (a.k.a. Ender) is faced with a request to go to Battle School, a place where children are trained rigorously to defend the Earth from a mysterious race called \\"buggers.\\"  Once there, Ender excels in all his studies, eventually getting him a position in the Salamander Army under the spiteful Bonzo Madrid.  Things only worsen as Ender moves up through the ranks and earns nearly homicidal enemies, while the teachers do nothing to see how Ender handles the situation.  This is an interesting story, but what really made Ender's Game so good was that it played on the emotions of the reader; the reader could feel Ender's calm moments and his hate when he literally destroyed his enemies (ala the Dark Side of the Force).  Orson Scott Card has sculpted a future Earth where compassion is all but a forgotten concept and sympathy is nearly void in all aspects.  A truly dark and emotional book, Ender's Game will remain on my list of sci-fi favorites second only to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series.
B00005JCAA|5.0|I consider this to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. It took me by surprise...I had seen the DVD in stores numerous times and never even considered renting or buying it; then a friend told me about it and loaned me the Ultimate Edition DVD. The acting was superb, the storyline very credible. I am not usually emotionally moved to tears by movies, but this one had me in tears at the end. There was not one actor in this movie that failed to impress me, and that's saying a lot these days. The film is very allegorical, and one scene that really got me was when Anthony Hopkins' character knocks on \\"death's door.\\" I found myself thinking about the ramifications of that... The sound track was also very moving and includes some great old songs. The Ultimate DVD also has the old B&W original \\"Death Takes a Holiday,\\" as well as some very enjoyable bonus materials. A well put together package. I highly recommend this DVD.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I haven't yet actually gone to a performance of WICKED, but I know that I'll love this CD even more after I do.

The musical themes are a tad repetitious but a few (\\"Popular\\" and \\"Defying Gravity\\") have classic show-tune infectiousness that will leaving you humming.

0143057189|3.0|Diamond admits he set out to write a book about how societies collapse because of enivironmental damage, but through his research he found this was only one of many factors.  This problem hinders the book throughout as he struggles to relate these two phenomena with selective case studies, but I believe these two large topics would have worked better as separate works.     Diamond also tried to create metaphors without the evidence to support them.  For example, he tries repeatedly to convince the reader that modern day Montana is similar to Norse Greenland and the United States is similar to the Mayan civilization, but his arguments fall short.      The best parts of this book are the modern day sections on Rwandan genocide, Hati, and industry and environmental policy.    These appeared well researched and unbiased with a personal agenda.  I felt the problematic sections were those on the ancient past and those attempting to predict the future.  They seemed to be based more on selective facts and personal conjecture.
B0000844I8|4.0|I decided to get the movie after I watch some of the series \\"Stargate SG-1\\", if this is your case I should say it is a smart move because you get the answer to many questions.

B0007M22TI|5.0|I am 21 years old and have only heard maybe one or two Celtic songs in my entire life.  After flipping through the channels on my local PBS station, I suddenly heard the voice of an Angel.  I got chills, goosebumps, and tears throughout the entire TWO HOUR performance.  I quickly realized these women weren't Angels, but Goddesses.  They have the power to evoke within someone every range of emotion with the simplest note of their voice and song.  I am completely blown away, just as you will be.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Sony must still be sore with Michael over that whole \\"Tommy Mottola is the devil\\" fiasco...how else do you explain that ugly picture on the front of this? (Coupled with the curious lack of promotion -- I'll bet Michael doesn't even know about this release.) But I rate it 5 stars based on the excellent, if not perfect, song listing. This is certainly all the Jackson you need if you're not a devoted fan of his. Seems to me \\"Butterflies\\" would have been a more obvious choice than \\"Dangerous\\", but I'm guessing that they wanted the title track of that album to be represented here, as was \\"Off The Wall\\", \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Bad\\". Glad to see they included \\"The Girl Is Mine\\"....and....speaking of Paul McCartney (segueway), I include of cover of his classic \\"Coming Up\\" on my album of the same name...Google \\"motionizer\\" for details!

0783225849|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock's tour de force may be this simple horror film about a guy who loved/hated his mom. Shocking the audience by killing off his heroine early on, he's the director who made viewers afraid to take showers. Hitchcock, who began his film career as a storybord artist, lays out each image in the film with precision, shot-by-shot drawing the audience into the growing horror of a deranged killer who could be lurching behind the desk of the next motel you visit. A masterpiece of suspense and shock!
B00009V7RF|3.0|The sound of the Black Eyed Peas is one we probably all know by now from either radio or Mtv. One of the other reviewers here points out that the BEP were 'better' before, less mainstream and minus the 'unbearable' sound of Fergie. I want to address to that person before I get into the album, because it's really important they - and you as well - understand something. Music changes, times change and taste changes. The Black Eyed Peas changed their sound, to something more mainstream. You can't avoid changes of sound - music grows and changes just like people do. And 'mainstream' is not a synonym for 'bad'. It's different, and it's a path you may choose as a musician. There are plenty of people who aren't into 'quality hip-hop', and who think it's the other way around. So don't let that mislead you. <br /> <br />Elephunk is an airy album, with the beats we all know and expect from the Black Eyed Peas since Fergie joined. If you liked the hits, you'll like the album. It's funky, original and fun and it's probably the highest quality mainstream music out now. If you are, however, looking for deep and true messages such as in \\"Where is the love?\\" you might want to try something else; the main thing the BEP focus on is partying and romance - not that that's a bad thing; that's what the youth culture nowadays is like, and the fact that people listen to this is only natural. Someone here mentioned it is pathetic; I think it's more pathetic to not even try to understand that music means something different to everyone. And if this is your thing - this album will DEFINATELY be your thing! <br />Enjoy! <br />
B00026WU3M|4.0|\\"Oh Mercy\\" is more like a Daniel Lanois album, with Dylan on vocals. While far from bad, considering the stature of the legendary Canadian producer who has worked with Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel and U2, to name a few, this may come as a shock to some die hard Dylan fans, as the album takes on a more \\"Lanois\\" sound. That said, I must say I love it. Not among Dylan's best albums (those honors tend to be distributed among his earlier works, in my opinion), but an excellent album nonetheless, with \\"Most of the time\\" as the best track on it, which happened to be the first song from the album I heard.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|God-awful, pretentious, self-indulgent, soporific nonsense. Vince Gallo needs to lighten up and have his friends pitch in and buy him some film classes, or at least some classic movies on DVD. <br /> <br />If I want to see a film shot almost entirely from the interior of a moving car looking through the windshield, I'll watch my own home movies from my last vacation. In fact, I may enter my home movies at the next Cannes Film Festival and see if I win any awards. <br /> <br /> <br />Only redeeming scene is where Chloe Sevigney goes pole diving on Vincent Gallo, but like another viewer correctly suggests, the movie is not worth dying through for this one scene, so download it from a website instead. The DVD is suitable as a drink coaster or mini-frisbee.
B00005U8EM|5.0|Catching up with the essentials is what we seemed to be doing, as we watched Bill Murray's \\"Groundhog Day\\". We just saw it in 2005, 13 years after its original release. And that says a lot about how timeless it is: how much it can work regardless of the time you watch it.<br /><br />The bottom line of the movie is fairly basic, when you first think of it: Bill Murray, who plays the role of a news weatherman from Pittsburg, is off to cover Groundhog Day once more, an event he's had more of than he can stomach. After the day is over, every day from then on, starts to repeat the exact same Groundhog Day, over and over. This gives him time to look deep inside himself after numerous failed attempts of \\"escaping\\" the time loop, and perfect things from saying the right things to everyone (including his new producer, played by beautiful Andie Macdowell) to becoming an accomplished ice sculptor and piano player, and even attempting to save the lives of those doomed to have an accident and/or die that day.<br /><br />His evolution as a person and the way he begins to see things in a different light as new Groundhog Days keep coming at him once and again is enlightening. At the end, it's more than just a feel-food romantic comedy. It poses some interesting and significant questions for us to ponder: What would you do, if you could live a day over and over indefinitely? What would you make of it? To me, alongside \\"Lost in Translation\\" it easily ranks as Bill Murray's best movie, and overall, it's become one of my favorites.

0441012906|2.0|While reading this novel, I felt convinced it had to be a first effort that had been buried in a file cabinet somewhere, brought out to help satisfy fans of the Revelation Space trilogy while Reynolds figures out where he really wants to go next.  The \\"Afterword\\" suggests instead that it really was written after the trilogy, though I wonder if my supposition isn't at least partly true.  Whatever the explanation, this book reads like very weak Reynolds - with a series of familiar devices:  out-of-control nanotech, personalities forced to share the same brain, conflict between baseline and self-modified human beings, extended chases maintained over astronomical distances, and so on, all handled much less convincingly, imaginatively, and involvingly.  At other key points, it's just weak writing, whether it's on the level of an archaeologist character who, with no apparent military experience or training behind her, rather easily defeats larger numbers of theoretically more capable adversaries, or whether it's on the level of a story that poses huge questions and never comes close to answering them.  Robert Charles Wilson recently handled one somewhat similar central concept, for instance - the Earth segregated from the rest of the galaxy by unthinkably superior alien technologies - in SPIN, and in my opinion his greater command of all levels of narrative, character, dialogue, and thematic development put Reynolds to shame.  Even Wilson's hard science fiction content - supposedly one of Reynolds' greatest strengths - is more well-developed and more interesting.  Here, Reynolds' work reads like naive Sci-Fi of a low order - the kind of thin stuff they might have served out on an old STAR TREK episode when the staff happened to come upon costumes and sets left over from another production.  None of this removes the pleasure I took in Reynolds' previous books - among my favorite novels of the last few years, whatever their flaws - but I'll be looking to his next book withas much trepidation as eagerness.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|It's great to see TITANIC finally get the DVD release that it deserves. 8 years ago, audiences around the world fell in love with this movie and it won a record 11 Oscars and became the highest grossing film of all time (with worldwide box office reciepts greater than $1.8 billion). <br /> <br />Whether you love the film, or hate it, no one can deny that it is a well-made movie and was a definite benchmark in movie history. The scope and magnitude of this picture was unprecedented and to this day, there are very few films with such a high calibre as TITANIC. <br /> <br />This DVD is definitely worthy to carry the name TITANIC, with over 29 delted scences, 3 separate commentaries, an alternate ending, a documentary on making the visual effects, and an anamorphic video transfer with 5.1 Dolby Digital Audio. I am very much looking forward to seeing this film finally come out on DVD for me to add to my DVD collection.
B00003CX9E|1.0|After I watched Citizen Kane 2 days ago, I have to say that I agree with the negative reviews. It's extremely boring. The story is really stupid, especially the ending. Anyway, I feel that he may have tried really hard to make this film good. Sadly it turns out a flop.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I agree with many people who say that X and Y is an excellent album, and features some of Coldplay's best moments. However, I also agree with those who think that this album lacks innovation. But a lack of ingenuity does not equal bad music. I don't listen to Coldplay for their avant-gardeness (if you will), but rather because their concepts and lyrics are universal, and ones that everyone can relate to (love, loss, hope, etc.). Like Chris Martin once said \\"You either like [George W.] Bush, or you don't. But the whole boy-girl thing, that's universal\\" (I might not have gotten that exactly right, but it was to that effect). <br /> <br />Coldplay as a band could work harder on pushing the envelope, but until then, I am completley satisfied with this album, and their previous two. Buckland's guitar work is simply awesome, his highlights including X and Y, Speed of Sound, Square One, and Low. Martin's vocals have also improved greatly,and songs like X and Y, Low, and 'Til Kingdom Come (the latter of which has no falsetto) show that. But, if you want cutting edge, 'progressive' music (I hate labels), why not try the Mars Volta??
B000AM4PBS|5.0|Friends(1994-2004) has not only became NBC's benchmark show for nearly a decade,but an endearing, and somewhat screwball look at late 20/early 30 somethings gained even more new fans today from syndication and DVD sets. <br />Unlike most shows in their first seasons,Friends felt like it was at it's peak,althought it was only the beginning.Thanks to brilliant writing that doesn't talk down to most 20 something at the time(although the creators were mid 30's plus).Another contributing factor were the distinctive characters themselves,Including the wound up,yet nuturing Monica Gellar(Courtney Cox&lt;Arquette>),her brilliant,yet nerdy brother Ross(David Schwimmer),The spoiled,yet endearing Rachel Green(Jennifer Aniston)who becomes Monica's roommate after becoming a runaway bride,The sarcastic,uptight Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry),The dopey,loveable out of work actor Joey Tribbiani(Matt LeBlanc)and the sweet,yet ditzy new age hippie Phoebe Buffay(Lisa Kudrow). <br />The best episodes include The One with the Thumb(Chandler's Smoking),The One with the Blackout,The One with the Boobies,The One with the Candy Hearts(featuring Chandler's loveably annoying on/off girlfriend Janice&lt;Maggie Wheeler>)The One with all the Poker,and The One where Rachel Finds Out(..about Ross's feeling for her). <br />After a phenomenal debut season like Friends,most shows coast on it's success and start to slip in quality.But Friends would only get better with each successive season. <br />Changes were in the air for the group.Joey joined the cast of Days Of Our Lives as the ill fated Dr.Drake Ramoray,we meet Phoebe's ex husband (Steve Zahn),Chandler gets a new roommate(Adam Goldberg)who turns out to be a psycho,and Monica falls in love with her dad's best friend Dr. Richard Burke(Tom Selleck).The seasons driving force is the beginning of the on/off again relationship between Rachel and Ross.Many classic episodes came from this season including The One where Heckles Dies,...the Baby on the Bus,...where Ross Finds Out,...the List,...where Ross and Rachel ... You Know,...where Dr. Ramoray Dies and ...Two Parties. <br />But also from season two was The One With The Prom Video,considered the greatest Friends episode ever.Not only are we treated to a plot involving a hidious bracelet Joey gives to Chandler,but an old video of Rachel and Monica's prom.Giving a glimpse into to past at an overwieght Monica,a pre-nose job Rachel,and an extremely dorky Ross(\\"Looking Good Mr. Kotter).The most surprising moment is after the viewing of the video, one of those special moments why Friends beloved by it's many fans. <br />The Third season of Friends would always be remembered as the year Ross and Rachel broke up,showing that the writers would shake up the show to keep it fresh and on it's feet. <br />In this season,the ups and downs of love effects the other characters.Monica's heartbreak after the break up with Richard,Chandler's short term relationship with Janice,Lothario Joey falling for his play's co-star(Dina Meyer),and even Phoebe reunites with her musical partner(E.G. Daily). <br />The best episodes includes The One with The Princess Leia Fantasy,..Where No One's Ready(Going Commando),..with the Flashback,...the Giant Poking Device,...the Football, .. where Chandler can't Remember which Sister,..without the Ski Trip,and..Ultimate Fighting Champion. <br />The unofficial two part The One where Ross and Rachel Take a Break/ the Morning After was the high point of the season in which Ross and Rachel take a break,only to break up when Ross spends the night with Chloe,\\"The copy girl\\".The episode includes some of the funniest moments as well as the most heartbreaking. <br />Although relationships were still an issue in the fourth season of Friends,Thrown into the mix were Chandler's cure for Monica's Jellyfish Stings,Phoebe Uterus,an apartment switch,Chandler's Thanksgiving inside a box,Ross's musical \\"sound\\",Wedding dresses,free adult TV and Joey's ballroom dancings takes the show to hilarious levels. <br />The season sees both Ross and Rachel make up,then shortly break-up(\\"WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!)only to find themselves in new relationships,Chandler fall in love with Joey's new girlfriend,Phoebe agreeing to carry her brother Frank Jr.'s triplets,and Monica and Chandler finally consumating their relationship. <br />The best episodes include The One with the Jellyfish,..with the Dirty Girl,..Chandler Crosses the Line/In A Box,.with the Embryos,..Ross's Wedding(I take thee Rachel&lt;!!!!>). <br />The fourth season cliffhanger (Ross saying Rachel's name in his vows,as well as the Monica/Chandler plot) promises a great following season . <br />Season five was somewhat of a transitional time on Friends as the Chandler/Monica thing heats up as well as the actors finally settling into their character that would continue to this day,usually a parody into themselves. <br />Ross gets in over his head thanks to his shrewish new wife,Emily and his sandwich,Phoebe gives birth to her brother's triplets,Joey lands a role in an independent movie,and Rachel's career moves brings her up in the world,while relationships get her down. <br />The best episodes include The One with all the Kissing,..The Hundredth Episode,..the Thanksgiving Flashbacks,...all the Resolutions,...where Everybody Finds Out,...the Ride Along,and The One in Vegas.Even with some signs of wear on the show,Friends fifth season is a lot better than most sitcoms of it's time <br />The sixth season of Friends was a turning point in the show as the character grow up and go through various transitions.Even though the sixth doesn't measure up to past seasons,the show is still as reliable on laughs. <br />Monica and Chandler move in together,jarring the winning chemestry a bit.The winning pairing of former roommates Joey and Chandler takes on a new direction.Ross struggles with his third marriage(to Rachel),and Phoebe is still the only reliable constant. <br />The classic episodes include The One where Phoebe Runs,....Ross's Teeth,....the Routine,....Unagi,...and....That Could Have Been. <br />Even after seasons five and six's dip in the show's quality,Friends sixth season still maintained the TV viewer love of this classic ensemble. <br />Season Seven of Friends is considered the weakest ever compared to the quality of the earlier seasons.It was the year leading up to Chandler and Monica's wedding.But with some weak plots, and Matthew Perry's fluctuating physical appearence, the show seemed on the verge of fatigue. <br />Despite such shortcomings, the season boasted such episodes as ...The One with Phoebe's Cookies,... the Engagement Picture,...all the Candy,...all the Cheesecakes,...they all Turn Thirty,...Ross and Monica's Cousin,and Monica and Chandler's Wedding. <br />Just when you think season seven ends with two shark jumping elements (a wedding and pregnancy), The following season bounces back in a way unexpected for any eighth season (if a show even gets that far).Although season seven was the weakest in terms of Friends other seasons, it was still alot funnier than most shows on the air at the time. <br />Season Eight has the show bouncing back and becoming more sucessful than ever.  <br />After ending with a wedding, and a pregnancy(two definate Jump The Shark moments),the show uses these two plots to good effects as Monica and Chandler deal with their first year as a married couple, and Rachel carries Ross's baby.Adding to the mix is Joey falling in love with Rachel.  <br />Premiering after 9/11,the eighth season of Friends took on a deeper meaning to it's fan as it kept up the laughs as the nationed kept up hope in the wake of disaster. <br />Season Nine of Friends was originally suppose to be the final season,but was extended for another.The season dealt with Ross and Rachel's new role as parents to baby Emma,Chandler and Monica's attempt to have their own, Phoebe meeting her soon to be husband Mike (Paul Rudd),and Joey dealing with his feelings for Rachel.  <br />The classic episodes include The One With-Where No One Proposes,...Phoebe's Birthday Dinner,...Rachel's Other Sister(with Christina Applegate),...The Lottery,...,In Barbados (featuring Aisha Tyler as Charlie).  <br />Whereas most shows are creatively bankrupt by it's tenth season(with the exception of the Simpsons),Friends manages to have some inspired moments although it's obvious this show has long since seen better days.  <br />Aside from the season only having 18 episodes,the season's biggest flaw is knowing the end is near, and wrapping up things in a tidy package.The best episode (obviously) is the Finale whereas we know the fate of Ross and Rachal,seeing it unfold is one of the most inspired moments of the entire series.Other classic episodes include TOW...Ross'Tan,...The Late Thanksgiving,...Phoebe's Wedding,and ...The Goodbye Party.  <br />After ten years, 236 episodes, and more classic moments than any show could have given us,Friends will live on in not only Re-runs,DVDs and spinoffs(Joey), but in the hearts of those that it has touched.  <br />
1850898774|5.0|The first book in O'Brien's 20-book saga following the travails of Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, Master and Commander and Surgeon, respectively. O'Brien does a magnificent job of recreating in implicit detail ports-of-call, ships, events, cities, even language bringing a realism to this fictional tale of life in the 1800's navies. However, despite trying to stay within historical accuracy, O'Brien does a great job of explaining those things which most of us don't understand, especially the way officers within the Navy are expected to react to each other. Also, while he doesn't explain all the nautical terms used in his books, I have found that simply having a dictionary near-by is a fine substitute for actual nautical knowledge.<br /><br />The story is set in the years surrounding the War of 1812 meaning that Aubrey and Maturin are involved in some of the more consequential events of that time, many of which you may have heard of. However, despite being so detailed, O'Brien does an acceptable job of keeping the story moving.<br /><br />All of these details work together to build a world that is almost tangible and, especially when accompanied by a CD of chamber-music, often totally engrossing.
B00008K7AM|2.0|Rob Schneider is a great character actor (see 50 First Dates or Big Daddy), but when he's handed the hollywood reins, it just doesn't quite work out (see The Animal or Deuce Bigelow). Movies like this one or The Animal have a few really great moments, ones that you'll be able to remember later, but that's about it.  <br /> <br />In The Hot Chick, Schneider plays a sleezy crook who switches bodies with a girlie, giggly prom queen named Jessica (played by Rachel McAdams). The movie mostly centers around Schneider attempting to play a high school girl, and I say \\"attempting\\" because he's not that convincing. McAdams, on the other hand, in her very limited screen name, manages to do what Rob Schneider cannot-- pretend to be a sleezy man trapped inside a beauty queen's body. Jessica obviously wants her body back, and is utterly grossed out to be a guy. She does manage to convince her friends that it really is her inside this man's body, so they nickname her \\"Spence\\" and have her pose as the janitor just so she can attend school. What's the con-man doing with the hot body? Stripping, of course, and conning and stealing because it's much easier to do as a sexy woman than as a sleezy looking little weasel.  <br /> <br />We see very little of McAdams in this movie, which is one of it's biggest faults. This is also a plot that has been been done so many times, that in order to do it, you have to do something really original. I like the concept of a con-man switching bodies with a high school girl, but there was no balance between these two characters. It should've been called The Rob Schneider Movie. Yes, he's funny and entertaining, but that doesn't make this movie good. If you're a Rob Schneider fan, you'll definitely love this movie. Everyone else... all I can say is rent before you buy.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|But the movie makers, in this case, stripped out almost everything that made Homer's Iliad involving and tragic on a human level.  A major portion of the female characters are gone, no Cassandra, no Iphigenia, no Clytemnestra, no Hecuba.   <br /> <br />I shudder to think what would have happened if Helen hadn't been the reason for the war.  As it is, she is a depleted character.   <br /> <br />I knew we were trouble when the actress playing her, whined in her dinky Little Nell voice, \\"Sparta is not my home.  I was sent from my home to marry King Menelaus.\\"  Oh gee, really?   <br /> <br />In the Iliad, it was made clear that Helen was Queen of Sparta before Menelaus married her. He became King of Sparta because he married her.  He had no right to rule Sparta unless he was married to her.  <br /> <br />When she ran off with Paris, she left poor old Menelaus in a pickle. Which is why he really did have to go after her and try to get her back.  Helen had true power as a woman and a queen.  We never get a sense of that from little dolly Helen in this movie. <br /> <br />What we are left with for the most part, except for the graceful presence of Peter O'Toole as King Priam, is a bunch of warrior jocks butting heads.  The jockiest of them all being Brad Pitt as Achilles.  He doesn't do a bad job of it but one is expected to care more for him than one can. <br /> <br />At the fall of Troy in this movie, who is there to mourn for?  Not the tragic old Queen Hecuba (Oooops, no Hecuba), not the half-mad young seerest Cassandra, enduring her own rape while foreseeing her own murder (Oooops, no Cassandra). Peter O'Toole, however briefly used as King Priam always has a claim on our emotions, so there is him.  In this version, Andromache is allowed to keep her child and Helen and Paris survive.   <br /> <br />No, at the end we are expected to mourn most of all for the one person who merits it least, Achilles.  He is the embodiment of the warlike spirit so his death cannot make usache for the tragedy of war. And since it brings him his dearest wish, the glory of an immortal name, it cannot even make us ache very much for him.       <br /> <br />Too much is piled on the character of Achilles because big money movie star, Brad Pitt, is playing him.  It throws the movie fatally out of balance.
1400049628|5.0|Quite possibly the most important book in my collection. <br />Real time data that just migjt save you and your loved ones. <br />Max Brooks should be considered as a subject matter expert for his wealth of knowledge on the subject. <br />
0671027344|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Stephen Chbosky captures the uncertainty of our teenage years. I definitely recommend this book.
B000002KO3|5.0|Let me explain:    Back in 1983, I bought \\"Speaking in Tongues\\", and thought it was excellent, but rather different - lacking somewhat in heart, and perhaps too \\"intellectual\\" for my taste (though I loved, and love, \\"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)\\").  Anyway, I was impressed enough that I went and bought their live album, \\"The Name of This Band Is The Talking Heads\\", and fell in love (no, I'm not talking about Tina Weymouth, though that's another story, and she does look mesmerizing in that one picture of her in the album jacket as she is walking away at night).  The music was endlessly innovative and invigorating - but one song in particular stood out from the rest for me, \\"The Great Curve\\".  Even though the rest of the songs were terrific, this song was for me like the prize in a tasty box of cereal (how's that for a poetic comparison?).    Well, years have passed, and sometime back in 1984 or 1985 was the last I listened to The Talking Heads.  I don't remember what became of my vinyls and cassettes of \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" and \\"The Name of This Band Is The Talking Heads\\", but they're not with me anymore.  This year (2005), however, the old love was re-inspired by, of all things, the TV series, \\"Numb3rs\\", specifically by its theme song cover of \\"Once in a Lifetime\\".  So, I went out and bought the updated version of \\"The Name of This Band Is the Talking Heads\\" (complete with songs not contained in the original live album), wondering how I would respond to music I had last heard over 20 years before.  Lo, it was as it was - it was as if not a day had passed, and I was in love again.  Especially with a song I had never heard before, \\"Born Under Punches\\".  And \\"The Great Curve\\" still had the same effect for me.    Well, what do you know, but both songs come from \\"Remain in Light\\".  Which means that quite possibly my favorite album of all time is one I've never actually heard.
6304806418|5.0|First, I declare my bias: I loved  the stage musical.  I saw it early on in its London run, and made sure I had a ticket for its final night in London.  And I've seen too many movie versions of stage musicals that are just dreadful.  So I had low, low expectations for this.<br />But it is WONDERFUL.  Not only was Madonna great, the resonances between her life and Eva's rise to fame gave an added frisson to her performance.  Banderas can sing and dance a storm, and the tango sequences are enough to convince anyone to join a dance class.  And there was at least some attention drawn to the repressive nature of the Peronistas, which wasn't - or couldn't be - done on stage.<br />Anything bad?  Sure.  The dreadful reallocation of 'Another Suitcase' to Eva rather than to Peron's mistress.  But I can forgive this in light of the sublime 'You Must Love Me', new for the movie, and a wonderfully double-edged lyric masterpiece.<br />Don't just buy this: play  it again and again!
B0000541AM|5.0|I remember when I first watched \\"The Warriors\\"...it was around 2 in the morning and I was watching HBO and about ready to call it quits for the day when suddenly a little preview for the movie came on. I was interested and decided to stay up and see what the movie was all about. I now am glad for staying up the extra time because this movie was flat out awesome. The basic story and concept rocks and the film pulls it off extremely well. There is chaos exploding all around in this movie and the individual gangs are very cool...they each have their own little niche. It was just an overall cool movie...and I loved it all. If you want an entertaining movie that is fun to watch then just watch this movie and I almost guarantee that you will enjoy it.
0671027573|4.0|Four middle aged work colleagues have had are on in their fair share of failed relationships and at their regular Friday night dinner decide to have a bit of fun and create a list of the characteristics that would make the perfect man. Their Mr Perfect list appears in their unofficial work newsletter and is then quickly picked up the media making them reluctant celebrities. Unbeknownst to them someone they know has been being moulded as Mr Perfect by their abusive mother since the day they were born and not only joins the list of outraged people condemning the Mr Perfect list but puts them on a their own list of women who need to die!<br /><br />A very entertaining read, it does drag on a bit at times, you will work out who the killer is long before the author tells you but this is an enjoyable read none the less. I've also read Dying to Please by Linda Howard which is just as good as this one.
B00097DX3U|5.0|A great classic rock album, with even better songwriting than Audioslave's self-titled first release. I'm a fan of the band's debut, but admit that it often sounded like Chris Cornell had temporarily taken over vocals at Rage Against the Machine. With \\"Out of Exile,\\" Audioslave has found its own sound, with stronger melodies and a more pronounced classic rock character. <br /> <br />My best music purchase so far this year. Great listening for any fan of rock n' roll.
B00006RU5B|5.0|With the members in Auidoslave, as said forms a superband but also causes very high expectations, which were succeeded. I dont know how other people look at it but to my personal likes audioslave beats RATM AND SOUNDGARDEN.     Not to grundgy and not to hard rocky rappy, instead a mix- eliminating the rap, thus Chris cornels voice of a god would be a disgrace rapping.    This album is what speaks rock in its true name loud old skool vocals great guitar and bass teamwork and a drumbeat you can't compete others with! I have nothing more to say, other than, anyone interested in Rock,or Metal the genre in basic, from country, to punk, to goth metal, youl like Audioslave, simply because, its Non- Unlikable.\  Definatly the best Alternative metal band out there today.    Highlights: Show me How to live, your time has come, gasoline, shadow of the sun
B00004YA66|5.0|One of the best movies I've ever seen, shows good father-son relationship. Very emotional as well. Must have for all.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|A mixed presentation of various musical genres and styles, this album is an appropriate last offering for the genius who influenced, popularized, and outright changed American music forever. <br /> <br />Although Ray is clearly not at his vocal best here, the emotion of his voice--which defined his career and ultimately never left him--is clearly evident here.   <br /> <br />Ray, who knew this was to be his last recording, breezes through lighter fare, as well as getting down to his heart-wrenching best. <br /> <br />Goodbye, Ray--we'll never forget you. <br />
B00000JNNY|3.0|This particular song by Etta James, is truly one to give  you  goosebumps.  John
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I absolutely LUURVE this man!  \\"The Way You Love Me\\" is the Michael I love....smooth vocals.  Almost takes you back to the \\"I Wanna Rock With You\\" feel.  This collection is a must have for any fan and admirer.  He put everything in this joint!  And you won't have to worry about any of your guest getting board at your house.  Just sit 'em on the sofa and pop the DVD concert footage in there.  Who do you know on this planet that can keep their eyes off of this dude when he is doing his thang on stage?  Nobody! <br /> <br />I love all of the unreleased joints.  I hope that when he recuperates, he comes back to his roots.  I can not wait to see what he will drop on us next!
B00004XQP4|5.0|This is the good ol green day i love. Warning is their more alternative album, kinda a sneak peak of what their going to bring next. Green day has grown a lot as a band in this album. Some good acoustic melodies and the catchy beats, youl have yourself a good time listening to this cd. IF you liek the sound of new green day then go ahead and buy the alright american idiot but if your digging this sound, this is a perfect punk album, or even if u dig the old skool green day you can go buy dookie or Kerplunk.  y  The album has 4 videos Macys Day Parade, Warning, Waiting and MInority, which are all stand out songs. Billies vocals have a different approach in this album to his old albums, more of a calm fun time then agressive dont give a sh** vocal jobs like in older albums.     Highlights: Warning  Waiting  CAstaway
0694003611|5.0|I have to say I never thought I would love this book.  If I were to rate it just as an adult, I would give it like 3 stars.  Having read it to my kids, I have to say this is their favorite book.  Margaret Wise Brown obviously knew something about kids I didn't know.  I can't believe she never had children yet she understood them so well.  I love the cardboard lap edition so the kids don't have to fight to see and the words are nice and big.  The kids are paying more attention to the words.  The letters stand out more in the bigger print.  It is built to endure too.  It is a beautiful book.
B00004U28G|4.0|this is one of my husbands favorite movies, I found it very funny
B00005Y84D|5.0|This DVD is long overdue.When George put this extravaganza together in 1971 he opened the door to benefit concerts, the most famous being 1985s' \\"Live Aid\\". Not only does Harrison give an impassioned performance but you also get the top celebs du jour, such as Clapton, Leon Russell, Billy Preston, Ringo and even Bob Dylan...to name a few.The band is in top form and everyones ego is in check on this night.You truly get the feeling that these musicians are serious about the cause which was the starving people of Bangladesh. <br />Harrison plays a lot of songs from his \\"All Things Must Pass\\" album which is considered by many to be his best right up to this day. Leon Russell is a show stealer and a smiling and humble Eric Clapton adds class and professionalism to the night. Billy Preston gives a spirited performance behind the keyboards and Bob Dylan, who comes out later in the show, takes it to another level playing a few songs on his own before being joined by the band for a sloppy but fun version of \\"Just Like a Woman\\". <br />George does an acoustic version of \\"Here Comes the Sun\\",accompanied by Peter Ham of Badfinger,which is not to be missed. When it all wraps up, Harrison sings his heart out on the title song, leaving no doubt that he means what he sings. <br />The fact that the DVD will contain added footage, including more Dylan and interviews with Clapton and Ringo makes the whole thing that much more enticing.  <br />A good companion DVD to this one would be \\"The Concert For George\\", whichn is a tribute to the late Mr. Harrison and features Clapton, Ringo, Billy Preston and Paul McCartney, to name but a few.
B00003CXXS|4.0|I like all the Jurassic Park movies, and without question \\"The Lost World\\" and \\"Jurassic Park 3\\" can't come close to the original materpiece, which is about 12 years old now, hard to believe!!! In my opinion, I think that this movie is better, than the \\"Lost World\\" by far!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      This movie just doesn't have the same feel as the original, but is obviously the most advanced film, with visual eye candy and plainly breath taking visuals!!! It just seems this film was rushed and could have been better!!! I just don't personaly like this movie as much as the original \\"Jurassic Park\\" for some reason!!! Well I suppose it doesn't matter because all the films are awesome!!! I will suggest this film for any action fan looking for \\"A Thrill Ride!\\" or a great movie!!!      The story take place after the evnts of the two before it!!! The movie kicks off when, Dr. Grant(Sam Niel) and Billy, his young counterpart are asked, by a wealthy couple (William Marcy) and his wife (Tea Leoni) to accompany them on a tour of the dreaded Isla Sorna, Ingen's former breeding ground for prehistoric creatures, and the second sight for the Jurassic Park!!!     Dr. Grant then discover's that their is more going on than he thought, it turns out that they aren't rich and are looking for their son who dissapered around the area!!! It turns into a struggle between life and deaf, facing clever and deadly Raptors, along with the whole dino infested island!!! Can they survive, and stay in one piece!!!      The special features are awesome too, which even makes this a better buy, of an already great one!!! This is plainly a great film !!! The movie was straight action from start to finish, which was great and always has you thinking, I wonder \\"What Will Happen Next\\", wanting more, more action!!! I also like how they featured the raptors more in this film, the raptors are kick @$$,... yeah, I love @$$ kicking action!!! The Teradactols, with the whole bird cage thing were awesome too!!! I also give kudos to some great acting!!!    Overall,  I will give this a 4/5!!! Plainly a great movie, but can't match the greatness of the original \\"Jurassic Park\\", It just doesn't have the same feel as the other two, but opens up Isla Sorna a new front in The Jurassic Park world!!! Not as good as the original, but kills \\"Lost World\\"!!!    Pros:  -Great visuals, breathtaking eye candy  -Raptors are new and improved  -More straight forward action approach  -Dr. Grant is back in this film  -Great concept, as usual!!!  -Awesome special features  -Terdactols!!!!!!!!    Cons:  -Not the same feel as the first two  -The movie was a little too short     Unlike, the other two films this is more of a survival thriller,with straight forward action rather than;adventure, guns galore action, and chaos feel that the original and \\"Lost World\\" had!!! Like I said before, this is a heck of a great movie, it isn't the best in the saga but is worth watching!!! This is overall second best next to the original!!!    I will suggest this to any action fan, or someone looking for a movie filled with thrills and chills!!! Or anybody who likes Jurassic Park, or any kind of sci fi!!!
B000002MP2|5.0|This was, lets face it green days most popular album, the one that sky rocketed them to over 14 million sales. Tre keeps the songs rolling with his drumin skills while billy keeps a melody with his bad-ass punk voice and his guitar.  Every song is extremly catchy and fully listenable not like some heavy rock these days. A great non-skip-track album. Includes a lot of hits like longview, basketcase and when i come around.The three of them make a great unbeatable smart team. The best 3manband around.     This is whats called good music, not by opinion by fact, Greendays a type of band thats just non-hatable.    SO if you just got into punk rock and are searching for the right band, well incase you havent heard, Green day are the PUNK-KINGS. And if youre already familiar to more modern green day releases well, every year music gets worse thats all i can tell you.  My personal favorite- Wheni come around, Longview,She
006092988X|3.0|I can't say I really loved this book but it was a decent read.  I loved the symbolism and the characterization.  I would say this is between 3 and 4 stars.  I just can't say it gripped me.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|I have to admit, this one was a bit of a disappointment. After having read the manga, and watched a few of Miyazaki's other films, I was expecting a lot more. I thought that my disappointment was caused solely by expecting it to be like the book, but even my sister, who never read the manga, said that she was disappointed. Please, do not judge Miyazaki by this film. It is not his usual quality of work.
B0000057C5|4.0|If you know of Rammstein, and like them.........why not have this album!  Gotta have it if your a fan......working on acquiring all the albums myself.......also, the Lichtspielhaus DVD is well worth the 10 bucks.......for the videos themselves......nice introduction to the band.......live feeds start off with pretty low quality, but they get better as the shows go on.........still 10 bucks!!!  Why Not! <br /> <br />Du hast bit......English version is junk......my take is a combinaion of the two sides of the contraversy. <br /> <br />song starts: <br /> <br />Du (You) <br />Du hasst (You Hate) <br />Du hasst mich (you hate me) <br /> <br />Du hast mich gefragt (you have asked me) <br />Du hast mich gefragt, und ich hab nichts gesagt ( you have asked me and I have said nothing) <br /> <br />listen to the song closely.......I think the Du....Du Hasst.....sounds different than the du hast in the du hast mich gefragt verse. <br /> <br />makes sense for the song too!1.....from the point view of the song \\"I\\" reject the vows because I know that the partner actually hates \\"me\\"...... <br /> <br />could be total bunk, but that's how I look at it........Jeremy Williams at [...] let on to this idea to credit where the idea came from.

B0007TKNIS|2.0|Honestly I think this movie seemed more of a comedy than any tear- jerking musical. And you probably assume I do not watch musicals but trust me I have seen a few musicals and a few of them were a lot more entertaining than this one. This is the show so widely praised all this time? Please, the story is by itself interesting enough to watch once, but the way it is played out, no catch that, dragged out, was boring, cheesy, and overdramatic. I mean I'm not a huge fan of musicals anyway but nonetheless I have enjoyed a few and this was not one of them. I just wanted to watch the Phantom because well I assumed if all these people kept saying it was wonderful it must have been. A common mistake I hate making.  <br />My friend says that the old one is different and I really hope so because getting to the end of this movie was exhausting. They just would not stop singing about every single thing and what would be a normal five minute conversation they made like ten minutes longer by singing it out and that is why the movie felt like it was being dragged out so slowly...I don't know, it just certainly was not an interesting movie to me nor entertaining. I found myself and my friend laughing at this movie more than anything, and also rewinding through a lot of the what we considered unnecessary singing.  <br />Why you wonder, if you're still reading this instead of angrily going on to another post possible Phantom fan, did I not so harshly give it a one star instead of an actual two star review? Well there was one thing I absolutely loved in this movie that unfortunately couldn't save the film but nonetheless kept me till the end and that was indeed the picture itself. The movie itself, the setting and the costumes, were gorgeous and I thought almost every scene in the movie was magical and lovely by sight. I loved looking at the movie definitely. But hearing it, and trying to keep interest in it throughout the long painful process of their constant prolonged singing, was too much. I don't think I could ever watch that story again, I don't care if there were other versions of the story, this movie just killed my interest in the Phantom plot.  <br />I watched it once out of curiosity and I think that's it for the Phantom and I. I know this movie has excellent reviews, but I feel I need to speak out for the people, and I know there are a few including my friend, who did not think of it so highly.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Don't let anyone tell you otherwise but all musicians either want you to hear the sounds they hear in their heads or the sounds that they hear in the studio.  Because technology in the 60s and 70s was nothing like what we have today, musicians could do nothing but the best that they could with the equipment of the time and hopefully with as good a sound engineer or producer that they could find.  Even Paul himself said that this represents as close as they could get to the sound they played in the studio itself.<br /><br />The original \\"Let it Be\\" was a Phil Spector album; 3 of the remaining 4 Beatles got together and decided that this was what they really wanted to produce i.e. what they intended and heard.  Who the heck are we to say this is crap compared to something Phil Spector did etc?  As I didn't by a Phil Spector album but a Beatles one, to me this very well-remastered and fully endorsed version of \\"Let it Be\\" without the inane interstitial chatter and over-the-top polish Phil Spector mess sounds very good and has Beatle support so screw the other version.<br /><br />The great sound has given the whole album a new lease of life and I can actually listen to it as if it's a new release.  Here's hoping all the other albums are given the same treatment!  I can hardly wait.  For those who are new to the Beatles and are wondering which version to get, get this one for all the reasons above.  If you are a Phil Spector fan, get the old version.<br /><br />The additional disc is also nice to have to give us some idea of how witty and funny the guys were in the studio and I'm sure is appreciated by many fans.  Hey, more is better than less to me anyway.
0613325419|3.0|I really expected more graffiti and more fabulous creatures. And alot of the creature descriptions were similar and confusing. But it was a good reference for the Harry Potter series. It helped me understand alot more about the creatures that made it more vivid in my mind.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|This cd is truly amazing. I'm a 15 year old African American female. Now i mainly listen to R&B or rap, but when I listened to the smaples I decided to just give it a shot and if I didn't like it then pass it along to a friend. Man was I in for total shock. This man blew me a way. I have never heard a voice like his on a caucasion (hope i spelled that right & no offense). I mean when I heard \\"More than Anyone\\" for the 1st time I cried. When I heard \\"Chariot\\" I remembered that song from a while ago. I didn't know that was by him, but I do know that I used to LOVE that song. I could go on for days talking about this man, but I won't. What I will say is that he is truly blessed with a gift and his cd is my favorite cd at the moment. Can't wait to hear more from him
B0002OERI0|1.0|Wow what do you know another mediocore realese from another mediocore band we get these songs this year and will get the same songs next year just more and more boring overdone bubble gum pop songs if you own one greenday record there is no need to buy this one or any other one becuase if you have heard one you have heard everything this band has to offer this band has been giong for along time but still fails to record anything somewhat original or thought provoking whatsoever anyone who takes political insight from billy joe is a tool
B000058T5E|3.0|I'm a very big Jeff Beck fan and have been for a number of years.  Yes, I belong to the \\"Truth\\", \\"Blow By Blow\\", \\"Rough & Ready\\", \\"Wired\\" school and I even learnt to play rock guitar by playing his licks and solos from all the albums above but what makes me respect JB is his insistence on experimentation and in reinventing himself instead of getting stuck in the blues like many of his contemporary greats that have already been mentioned in previous reviews.<br /><br />This disc is nothing close to his albums mentioned above and I bet he's gained a whole new fanbase since then and I suppose to them, this album will be truly great.  For me, there's just too much Prodigy in this and it's really hard to hear what JB's contribution to it all is except that he wrote most of the tracks and plays some guitar.<br /><br />It seems the MVP here unlike in JBs other albums is not JB but the producer Andy Wright who does a really great job.  This album is very well produced and sounds great.  Although it's quite short, it's still quite a fun listening experience which is why I've given it 3 stars.  For those who are expecting \\"Wired\\", please don't get this album as you'll be very disappointed.<br /><br />As for me, I've accepted that as a musician, JB had to grow and move on and so I respect this effort of his although I'll probably never buy another one of his albums unless it's a remastered miniature-LP cover re-release of the albums I mentioned in the first paragraph.  I was too late the first time around and now they've all been sold out!  Drats!
0064407667|4.0|I think that this book is very exciting and original. It is a educational book even! It is really a pleasent (or unpleasent) family book! I do hope that people of all ages can read it together!

B00067ZONA|5.0|I have been a marginal Genesis fan for some time, and I have enjoyed most of their eras of music.  If you are a fan of the early music, you are in for a huge treat with the re-mixed versions from Nick Davis. <br /> <br />Simply put, he took enjoyable tracks and turned them in to blazing, crystal clear renditions of themselves.  From what I understand he worked from the original master tapes, and used modern digital audio software to clean things up, re-balance the mix and make things sonically tidy. <br /> <br />The results on tracks of Disc 2 and 3 are worth the price.  Simply put I was not prepared to enjoy these old tunes this much. <br /> <br />In case anyone who has control over such things is reading this, I would be happy to purchase all the oldies again if they had this treatment to them. <br /> <br />Hogweed anyone?
B000006NPY|1.0|Take this CD, put it in your player. When you hit \\"play\\" you will soon hear a grating sound, aka the whiny voice of Billy Pumpkinhead. Alternatively, take this CD, put it in your blender, hit \\"grate\\". It will make a better sound.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|I have all the Beatles stuff and I will always purchase all the Beatles stuff because they were just the best band in the world.  But I can only give this CD a marginal recommendation.  Yes it is a great big collection of Beatles songs, but the dictionary has all the words in it too, and it doesn't make for very interesting reading either.    The Beatles albums were all so good and the songs on each album seemed to belong right there.  There was a theme and a concept for each album.  The problem with this number ones CD is that it covers such a large span of time in the Beatles careers that it includes songs that don't fit so well together. If you want a compilation look to Past Masters volume II which was pretty good.  Even Past Masters volume one for the earlier stuff.  I am more in favor of breaking up the work into \\"like\\" sections of material.     What the Beatles haven't done yet is to make a \\" Best of \\" CD.  The very Best songs.  Not the number ones.  Because number one is really meaningless.  I would have to have \\" Strawberry fields\\", \\" \\" A Day in the Life \\", \\" Blackbird\\",\\" \\"I saw her standing there \\", \\"Across the Universe\\" just to name a few on a \\" Best of the Beatles \\" CD.    And finally, what is with this new remastered sound they have?  Perhaps it's because I have listened to the original Beatles albums and CDs so many times and for so long that these digital remasters sound a little strange to me but I think there is something missing.  It sounds like some of the volume is gone or something.  I can't quite put my finger on what it is.  That vintage \\"Punch\\" has been removed and they sound too weak.       If you want to own a few Beatles CDs that represent the group and their music, here is my recommendation:    1.  \\"Please Please Me\\" ( Earlier work with Excellent Rock and Beautiful Ballads ).  2.  \\"Revolver\\" ( for harder Rock and complicated ballads ).  3.  \\"Past Masters Volume 2\\" ( Good compilation overall ).    Then if you liked \\"Please, Please me\\" better than the other two I would recommend you next acquire:      4.  \\" Help \\"   5.  \\" Rubber Soul\\"  6.  \\" A Hard Days night \\".     Those are the other stand out CDs from the early era.  All with amazing songs.    If, on the other hand you liked \\"Revolver\\" more than \\"Please, Please me\\", I would recommend you go directly to:      7.  \\"Abbey Road\\"  ( Oh, Darling ! )  8.  \\"Let it Be\\"   (Across the Universe )  9.  \\"The White Album\\"   (Blackbird, Julia, Dear Prudence, more)        To round out your collection you must have:    10. \\"Sgt. Peppers\\"  ( A Day in the Life, Lucy in the sky, Sgt Pepper)  11. \\"Magical Mystery\\" Tour.  ( Strawberry Fields, I am the Walrus )    Those albums made history and contain excellent work.      The rest of the CDs are good too.  There are great songs on every Beatles ablum that was ever made.        Better pick up all the vintage versions of these CDs before they screw them up too.  Your collection is not complete, is not really a collection unless you have all of the Beatles suff.  Then you can make your own \\" Best of\\".
B00030590I|2.0|This is a beautiful movie; visually stunning, outstanding choreography, good acting, and made with real attention to detail.  But what is the point of all this genuine artistry?  The dialogue is a lot of semi-mystical garbage.  Much has been made of the Rashomon-like structure of the plot but without real human content this is just another piece of slick technique.  Commentators who argue that this is a thinly disguised piece of Chinese nationalist propaganda are onto something.  The first Qin emperor is an ambiguous figure in Chinese history; the first unifier but also a real tyrant.  This film's argument is that individuals have to be sacrificed for the greater good and glory of a unified Chinese nation.  There is no doubt that this message is congenial to the present rulers of China.  This certainly wouldn't be the first time a historical fantasy has been used to support contemporary ideology (by either nominally communist or non-communist leaders).  Nor is it the first time that a really talented film maker has exchanged their services for resources to make a big film.  It wouldn't be fair to say that Hero is another  Triumph of the Will, but its closer to that brilliant but immoral picture than to something like any of Kurosawa's best historical films.
B00007AJGH|5.0|Not too many family movies stand the test of time...this is one of them!  A bit too intense for little kids, but my 7 and 10 year old girls love it.  We were watching with their grandfather who got a big kick out of it, too.  Christoper Lloyd is a terrific villian and there are plot twists worthy of an adult murder mystery.  And where else can you see Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny sharing the screen? <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|U2 still isn't shy about favouring the ATYCLB era. Since 2000, U2 isn't U2 anymore, rather is the most commercial and ugly pop. The rating bad is too good for it.  <br /> <br />Do they had to sacrifice their whole songwriting quality, greatness, transcendence, in other words art, in order to get their hands on the big bucks?. <br /> <br />But what pisses me more is that they throw us two candies (Vertigo and City Of Blinding Lights) as if die-hard fans were stupid to believe it's a \\"return to their roots\\" only because these two tracks.  <br /> <br />In other words they insist with the pop ATYCLB stuff but because they know new fans are not faithful enough to buy this sad collection of ATYCLB outtakes (most of them had forgotten the band after Pop), but they try to sell a few more albums to the older and only loyal fans using a few tracks and JT sound (With keyboards, Edge's guitars, etc, etc) as a fishing hook. <br /> <br />Waste of time apart from City Of Blinding Lights. If you've ATYCLB, then you've got the stuff already and it shows how crap later U2 music have been, particularly to us fans who followed the band from War onwards. No doubt adored by the US and European corporates who hated their glory 90s. <br /> <br />Even the \\"U2\\" trademark isn't the saving grace anymore. Stop pretending to be \\"the biggest band in the world\\" and all that Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame s*** and try hard to write decent songs and NEW music before calling something as a \\"U2\\" release. <br /> <br />... and you know it's time to go... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0009W5JS2|4.0|Suprised me...Ice Cube did a good job.  The movie was non stop action packed with good special effects.  Good mixture of action, humor and sarcasim.
B00005JNTX|1.0|First, let me start off by saying that I'm a huge comic book fan. I'm even a big fan of some of Frank Miller's work and recognize that Batman: Year One is one of the best Batman stories ever written. That said, I hadn't read any of his Sin City stories and I definitely won't be reading them now.<br /><br />The thing that bothers me the most about the steaming pile of crap called Sin City is that it is being held up as an example of what comic books are truly about, with numerous reviewers touting it as the first authentic translation of a comic book.<br /><br />The only positive thing about Sin City was its visual style, specifically the limited and dramatic use of color against a backdrop of a black and white world. The acting was very poor, even by the big name actors. The dialogue was so cheesy it made me wince. And the story was trite, ridiculously gory and completely mysoginistic. The outcome of all the violence is also so unrealistic (with people getting shot repeatedly, blown up, being in horrific car crashes, etc., and then getting up and walking away as if nothing had happened) that I half expected Bugs Bunny to pop up at any moment. And some of the scenes were profoundly disturbing, and not in a good way (like the sick romance between Jessica Alba and her father-figure Bruce Willis).<br /><br />My friend was begging me to walk out after the first half-hour, but I stayed hoping the movie would get better because I really wanted to like the movie. I am completely baffled by the number of good reviews this movie has gotten. It's hard not to wonder if we saw the same film.<br /><br />Please don't leave this movie with the idea that this is what comic book fans like. Sin City is not at all representative of the diverse, mature works the comic industry is capable of. If you want a true example of a good adaptation of a good independent comic, go see American Splendor or Ghost World. And if you want a good example of the best that the action adventure genre of comics has to offer, go see Batman Begins instead.genre of comics has to offer, go see Batman Begins instead.
0743454537|4.0|If you are a member of a family, this book will make you think and probably make you cry.   <br />There is no getting around the fact that Anna was picked before birth because she was a genetic match for her cancer-stricken sister.  After years of donating renewable resources to her older sister, she is told -- at the tender age of 13 -- that she will be donating a kidney. <br />From here on out the Picoult gets into how Anna must feel, and how she's coping.  We hear from both parents, who oddly have very differing views on what her sister's illness is doing to Anna and the family.  We see the love --- and resentment --- that Anna has for her sister.   <br />This is a very thought-provoking book.  Would you side with Anna in the medical emancipation lawsuit?  Are you sure about that? <br />A great book.  I couldn't put it down, but I sometimes found it difficult to read through the tears.
B0000C0FJB|1.0|Unbelievably bad. The DVD sounds even worse, as it is more compressed. I still can't believe Rush even agreed to release this garbage. Their audio standards are usually quite high. The person in charge of this mix should NEVER be let inside a studio again. EVER. I want my money back.

B0009W5JS2|1.0|I suggest you see this movie if:<br /><br />1. You're a genius and need to feel dumber<br /><br />2. You're a liberal and don't believe Hollywood has an anti-conservative agenda<br /><br />3. You're an idiot and need to feel smarter<br /><br />I'm no genius and no liberal, so I fall into the third category. This movie is complete garbage. Force-fed political-driven plot (haven't we had enough of this?), crappy dialogue (no surprise), non-believable scenes.  There were a few redeeming qualities such as the cool gadgets and the fact Jackson can light up almost any movie no matter how stupid.  Just to be clear, I am a fan of Jackson's talents, just not a fan of his views and movie roles.<br /><br />My favorite part of the movie was when computer boy hacks into NSA's security system within a couple seconds/minutes/hours.  I mean, come on.  We're talking about a security agency whose sole purpose is to protect National Security.  Key word here guys, \\"Security\\".  Not something you just waltz into. Not to mention he's able to find this \\"needle in the haystack\\" document while he's in there.<br /><br />Let me sum it up this movie for you:  \\"Black man done wrong by white man gets chance to seek revenge and justice\\".  It seems at least one movie like this comes out every year.  And almost always stars either Samuel Jackson (Rules of Engagement, Changing Lanes, Shaft, Die Hard III, The Negotiator, A Time to Kill) or Denzel Washington (Manchurian Candidate, Out of Time, John Q, The Siege, Crimson Tide, Ricochet). Why is this?  For the most part (of course there are exceptions), white folks would like to blur the lines between black and white.  As a white person, it becomes frustrating to constantly see your race labeled as evil/greedy/selfish, uncool, oblivious people.  This film just further proves my point...they're either:<br /><br />Evil (Dafoe, his 'hillbilly' agent, sexy white girl)<br /><br />Nerdy pawns (computer boy)<br /><br />Oblivious pawns (Speedman and Strauss)<br/><br />I did find it a bit comical that Dafoe's character's initials spell GOD.<br /><br />I was able to look past most of the racial remarks made by Ice Cube (the supposed hero of the movie), however, the one that stuck out was when he called Dafoe's white NSA agent a 'hillbilly'.  Isn't that just a tab bit insulting and racist?...even if he was the bad guy.  I could understand if the villain was to utter those words to the hero, as it further degrades the villain's character.  For one thing, the guy wasn't even remotely 'backwoods' material.  He was a highly trained/educated special agent.<br /><br />Also, why does the movie have to portray most of the black characters as \\"cool\\" criminals?  Ice Cube's only friends run chop shops.  Is that supposed to imply this is a cool profession?  If you've never had your car stolen before, you probably don't see a problem with this.<br /><br />As XXX-2 was worse than the first, let's hope the third installment doesn't follow suit.
B0009HLDFU|2.0|This two CD set is not a CD you should rush out and buy.  The first CD is classic Foo Fighter style.  The songs are good, solid rock - just what you'd expect from the Foo Fighters.  CD two is acoustic.  It isn't what you'd expect.  It is good to see a band step outside the box and do something new and unexpected.  So while I applaud the Foo Fighters for stepping out of the box, I found the second CD completely lame.  The songs were unmelodic and uninspiring.  There was no punch, no life.  If you want solid rockers doing acoustic the right way pick up the last Godsmack CD or take a step back in time about a decade and pick up an acoustic version of Alice in Chains.  The verdict here is download the best and forget the rest.
B00005JMXX|3.0|Another one of the typical HolyWood, Liberal, Tree-Hugging, Elitest movies, blaming the evil conservatives for everything from the extinction of the dinosaurs to the Tsunami that hit Asia.  Note the resemblence of the high political figure to a real Republican one currently in office. <br />If you can get past this fact and you're not one of the dumbing-down generation capable of being brainwashed by it...the special effects are good and if you just let yourself enjoy, it's a fair doomsday movie.
B000002C1V|5.0|Are you people mentally challenged? I love every one of Floyd's albums, but this album makes clear on who was the creative force driving the early Floyd albums; Waters. Gilmore is an excellent musician, but Waters had the skill for masterpieces.  The Final Cut is Another Brick in my Pink Floy Wall.      Sadly, I did not hear this album until recently.  I thought I had heard all the Pink Floyd there was, but I was sadly mistaken.  This is the most underated Floyd albums that ever existed.      I am only 26 yrs old, therefore, I did not \\"grow up\\" with Floyd.  But, to all you Waters naysayers, I say open up your eyes, your ears and your mind. It is blatently clear  who was the creative force behind \\"The Wall\\", and it wasn't Gilmore.  If you think you are a \\"diehard\\" Floyd fan, but don't own this album, then you are not and you must do 1 of 2 things;  stop being a Floyd fan (cuz your not) or add this album to your Floyd collection.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Really impressed with both the lyrics and the music. Just listening to the soundtrack, it is possible to follow the story of the show...not always the case with musicals. Great variety in the songs, excellent characterization: we are saving our pennies to get to the nearest city producing 'Wicked'. We have listened to this soundtrack at least 20 times since we purchased it- we love it! Extremely strong vocal artists with dramatic, often moving lyrics.
B000000OUE|5.0|I remember loving this cd back when in was in middle school (which was around the time this came out) but I hadn't heard it since. Well, my brother recently bought it and I've been listening to it alot now, remembering how bad ass it was. <br /> <br />The lyrics in here make absolutely no sense, and sometimes you can barely even understand what he's saying. So with that being said you can basically make whatever you want out of the lyrics. I remember that I used to think that this cd was somehow based on the Book of Revelation and that it was about the end of the world. After all, the song \\"Blood, Milk, and Sky\\" has that apocalyptic sound to it. I think I once actually sat and thought about how each of the songs somehow represented all the stages of the apocalypse. Wierd. This is a great cd.
B0009IOR6Q|4.0|This musical uses young Johnny's musical talent. It is a classic teenager story. It is well done and entertaining. A must have for any Johnny Depp fan.
B0006399FS|1.0|U2 absolutely should've packed it in after Pop. There's something in this world called \\"selling out\\" and it occurs when for some reason...great bands decide that they want to \\"please the masses\\" personally, as a musician, I've never understood this.  <br /> <br />Nobody can deny the fact that they completely sold out with ATYCLB, and it works, at least in terms of record sales and charts, but NO artistically. The problem is that they didn't notice that. They still believe that ATYCB is their third masterpiece and both Zooropa and Pop are just crap. They are so, so wrong. Just 'Please' alone blow all this free falling (musically) 2000 era away. <br /> <br />This unforgivable collection of radio friendly commercials mixes ATYCLB, arena rock and the obligatory mid tempo songs in the same vein as Joshua Tree, but now sounding 20 years older, sellouts, unoriginal and dated. No possitive thing remains of the original band, and this iPod band has not enough quality to even reach a mediocre status.  <br /> <br />All the songs are unmemorable, except for City Of Blinding Lights, maybe. The rest is just shame. <br /> <br />I'm a U2 purist (that's 80s and 90s) and, like most of long time fans here, I detest, absolutely detest 00s. <br /> <br />This is a truly awful album by a bunch of washed up middle-aged men attempting to connect with the kids! The songs on this album are nothing more than a vain attempt to cash in on a legendary name & sell the product to the MTV generation by people who should know better. <br /> <br />Please U2, trying to catch with commercial mainstream. What a Shame. Sellouts <br /> <br /> <br />
0064471837|4.0|This is a good, fantastic read, with well-drawn and intriguing characters and a strong pace in an exciting world where the dead come to life at the hands of necromancers. The style and substance and imaginative energy of the novel can be compared favorably with that of other stories like the Earthsea trilogy of Leguin or the Dark Materials trilogy of Pullman -- even if, so far in the first novel at least, it lacks what you might call the theological and metaphysical dimensions of either of these. So far, in spite of an inventive system of magic (both that tied to an ancient charter that brings order to the realm and a deeper and darker \\"free magic\\" that binds life and death), the story is really tied at a metaphysical level to a fairly conventional sense of good and evil, of heroes and villians, in a world that is interesting but not entirely original. The world it is set in, while fairly complex, is also more narrowly self-contained than that of these other novels. I expect that things will deepen as the trilogy progresses; so far, this is an excellent and gripping read, that doesn't yet have the feel of an abiding classic.
B00004TWZF|5.0|The Big Blue by Luc Besson was not well received by the french critics when it came out almost 20 years ago in France. It tourned out to be a massive commercial success. French people are conoisseur of great quality movie. This film should be studied by anyone in the film industry. It appeals too everyone. It is very visual, the images of the sea and Greece are truly amazing. It is also very auditory, the jokes, the differents accents (the characters are very international) and the unforgetable music that really captures the drama of the movie. It is also extremely kinestetic, the love story is great, the slow motion free dives are unreal, the dolphins... <br />This movie is really entertaining. The characters are really funny. Rosanna Arquette is at her best. It is the movie that made Jean Reno famous and Jean-Marc Barr is magnificent and really captivating. <br />It is really a breathtaking movie about love, friendship, passion and staying true to yourself, while it remains hillarious and has great photography. I highly recommended to everyone. I am sure you will love it too.
B00000F14B|5.0|\\"The Music Man\\" is, for my money, the definitive piece of musical Americana. It's also my all-time favorite Hollywood musical, a movie I've loved every minute of ever since I first saw it in my hometown theater at age 7 or so. Now, thanks to this excellent DVD, everyone who loves great musicals can enjoy <br />it.  <br />       What makes \\"The Music Man\\" so special? That's easy: the great Meredith Willson and his rollicking, rousing, hilarious songs, story and script (the latter faithfully adapted by Hollywood veteran Marion \\"See Here, Private\\" Hargrove). Nobody ever wrote better, wittier or livelier comic patter songs, and nobody delivered them better than Robert Preston- who, nearly half a century after his Broadway debut and many years after his death, IS Professor Harold Hill. Preston still bursts through your screen with his confident, exuberant and mesmerizing turn as the world's most famous flim-flam man, that wannabe bandleader who jumps the train to put one over on those straitlaced rubes from River City, Iowa. I still think \\"Trouble In River City\\" is the greatest comic number of its kind ever, and if \\"Seventy-Six Trombones\\" doesn't get you marching around the room, go call your local funeral director. \\"The Wells Fargo Wagon\\", \\"Gary, Indiana\\", \\"Pick-A-Little\\"- it just never stops. What a clever, unique lyricist Willson was! Of course, he wrote lovely ballads here too: \\"Goodnight, My Someone\\", \\"Till There Was You\\" (legitimized by the Beatles, of all people, who sang it on their \\"Ed Sullivan\\" debut), and my lifelong barbershop favorite, \\"Lida Rose\\".  <br />       Preston isn't the only one who delivers the goods on this fabulous score. Shirley Jones was a huge musical star by now (and an Oscar-winning dramatic actress too); she's just right as the prim-and-proper Marian, madame librarian and piano teacher, who happens to sing like an angel even if she sees Hill's game right away. I love her \\"Will I Ever Tell You\\" counterpoint to \\"Lida Rose\\". Little Ronny Howard, then known as \\"Opie\\" from \\"Andy Griffith\\" and decades away from becoming a beloved movie director, is great as lisping, towheaded Winthrop (who gets to sing parts of \\"Gary, Indiana\\" and \\"Wells Fargo\\"). Even Buddy Hackett, whose mush-mouthed Flatbush accent sounds way out of place in this heartland setting, does his best as Hill's old buddy Marcellus as he introduces \\"Shipoopi\\", the big square dance number at the ice cream social.  <br />       Most of the supporting cast were well-worn comic character actors who'd been around forever and fit the turn-of-the-century, \\"American Gothic\\" (look for the sight gag based on that Iowa icon) setting perfectly: Paul Ford as the scatter-brained, huffy mayor; Hermione Gingold as his stuck-up wife (I love how she says \\"BALL-zak!\\"); Pert Kelton as homespun Mrs. Paroo; and the Buffalo Bills- not the football team, but one of America's great barbershop quartets (named for their hometown)- who add old-time vaudeville intros to their precious, old-time harmonies. <br />       This movie runs 2 1/2 hours but doesn't slow down for a minute. In addition, the widescreen presentation allows for clear, bright looks at the lively dance numbers and gingerbread- <br />Midwest settings. A nice old-timey touch was added by director Morton DaCosta, better known for his excellent stage work capped by this original Broadway show; he employed the silent-era \\"iris\\" <br />shot to give Hill and Marian a quaint, yet warm, \\"footlight\\" glow as their numbers fade out. <br />       There's also a nice half-hour feature on the movie (and stage play)'s history, featuring the still-gracious Shirley Jones <br />(Preston passed away in the '80s). Onna White, the choreographer on both versions, also appears; her work took weeks, and it shows. Who else pulled off a delicate, ten-minute soft shoe in a library? Oddly enough, Warner wanted Sinatra- Sinatra!- for the Hill role. But Willson was \\"Iowa Stubborn\\" enough, she says, to say \\"No Preston, no picture\\". Can you imagine Ol' Blue Eyes in that band outfit? Me, neither. It's also well-known that Shirley was very pregnant while doing this movie. The answer? Well, check out the July 4th pageant scenes and the slide that gets slipped into the \\"Columbia\\" number! <br />       There's a reason- actually, a lot of reasons- why \\"The Music Man\\" is still staged, revived, remade and loved even by the most jaded, sophisticated \\"blue-state\\" audiences. But why should I tell you what they are? Go rent or get this DVD for yourself. There's no better musical Americana!
0451527046|5.0|I had already tried reading my copy of this book when I was far younger, but I was not as avid a reader as I am these days. Recently, parted from my copy, I picked up an old nondescript hardcover of Treasure Island at the library to complete the book in its entirety.<br /><br />I found the first half of the book highly enjoyable, one that I recalled warmly as I re-read it. But as the book progressed, I was astounded at how difficult the reading was becoming; the pirate slang and their use of strange metaphors obviously grew proportionate to the amount of pirates in the scene. In one of the few moments of humor, the hero Hawkins even says, \\"`Well,' I said, `I don't understand one word that you've been saying. But that's neither here nor there[...].'\\" The dialects makes the book that much more realistic; in my mind, however, I wonder if children reading this book fully comprehend it, or were they simply smarter in the 19th century? After spoiling myself with easy modern thrillers, I had to hunker down and really concentrate my efforts in trying to understand the subtext. The rough slang slowed my reading down greatly, but increased my enjoyment. And, of course, having finally completed the book and knowing the true story, my re-read in a few years will be thrice as good!<br /><br />In 1881, while vacationing in Scotland, Stevenson painted an island with his stepson which became the inspiration for the novel.  He soon wrote 15 chapters, and completed the rest in Switzerland at the rate of one chapter a day.  It was finally published as an entire novel in 1883.<br /><br />Stevenson throws together goods that have become legendary in pirate lore: Pirates with fantastic names, like Captain Flint, Billy Bones, Black Dog, Pew, Israel Hands (based on the real-life member of Blackbeard's crew), and the now-infamous Long John Silver, himself with a parrot on his shoulder; a single treasure map that has three red crosses (designating two piles of treasure, one pile of arms); a beautiful schooner that's put through its paces; a 23 member crew (excluding Jim Hawkins, Doctor Livesey, and Squire Trelawney), most of whom become gentlemen of fortune; mutiny; double-crosses; the shanty \\"15 men on a Dead Man's chest/Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum\\"; the notorious Jolly Roger; spirits, superstition, and lore; and even a skeleton or two.<br /><br />Treasure Island actually refers to the fictitious Skeleton Island---perhaps an inspiration for the children's book The Secret of Skeleton Island (1966)---, a sweltering jungle in the day and eerily submerged in mists in the early mornings. A strange coincidence I found led me to some interesting finds. Stevenson named an anchorage point after the pirate Captain Kidd. In 1935, Harold T. Wilkins published a book entitled \\"New Facts about Mysterious Captain Kidd and his Skeleton Island Chests,\\" in which can be found one of Kidd's treasure maps. Two years after Wilkins's book was published a treasure hunter found an uncanny resemblance between this \\"Skeleton Island\\" and Oak Island in Nova Scotia, Canada. Oak Island's impervious Water Pit is purportedly where Captain Kidd buried part of his treasure before being hanged in 1701 (the Pit is also the main inspiration for the 1998 novel Riptide). In a twist worthy of Robinson himself, despite Kidd's map uncovering some of Oak Island's mysteries, Wilkins eventually stepped forward to admit his maps were fabricated.

B000067CQK|5.0|Could The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars be the very best album of all time. Does the legendary album live up to all the extravagent hype, or does the album just fall short at the finish line? Well I personaly think Ziggy Stardust is one of the top three albums of all time along with Aerosmith's Get Your Wings, and The Rolling Stones' Exile On Main Street. Released in 1972 David Bowie created a spaceage creature who fell to earth with his band and became the biggest rock star the world had ever seen, bigger then Elvis and The Beatles. Ziggy Stardust takes you on an apocalyptic journey through exactly what the title suggests, the rise and fall of him and his amazing band. The album also shows what an ego-maniac Bowie was in the 1970's as been quoted as saying, \\"Thats truly what I though was going to happen to me!\\"<br /><br />The album opens with the beautiful 'Five Years' which is truly one of the best songs David Bowie ever composed. The wonderfull lyrics and perfectly complamenting piano tell the story of Ziggy being and outcast on his home planet of Mars and him knowing that he was something special. Next is the saxaphone heavy 'Soul Love' which is another nice ballad with a great chorus that is sure to have you singing along, this song is about how even though Ziggy knew he would become the biggest rock star in the world he was still a person searching for love and exceptence. 'Moonage Daydream' is quite possabley the best song David Bowie ever recorded. This is one of those songs where every little detail came together perfectly creating something so special and fantastic that words themselfs can't begin to describe. I mean where would you start, the powerful vocals and production, The amazing lyrics, or how about that legendary guitar solo that Mick Ronson plays at the end of the song. All who have hear this song know what I am taking about and those who havent should do themselfs a favor and pick this up for 'Moonage Daydream' alone! The next song was David Bowies biggest hit to this point, 'Starman' is a beautiful ballad about the people on earth who knew Ziggy was coming and the song is not one you can really describe it's one that has to be listened to, to be fully appreciated. 'It Aint Easy' is a cover song that unless you had heard the original you wouldnt know it was a cover. Bowie takes this song and makes it all his own, and takes the chorus to a whole new world. 'Lady Stardust' is a beautiful ballad from the point of view of who else, Lady Stardust, Ziggy's wife. It tells of how she first saw the band perform and how she fell in love with Ziggy. The next two songs 'Star' and 'Hang On To Yourself' seem to be the blue-print for late 1970's punk, proving once againt the Bowie was ahead of his time and is post-modern in all the terms glory. 'Ziggy Stardust' the title track shows the demise of the band as Ziggy over indulges in drugs and booze. The title track is one of rocks most legendary songs, as it is still played on the radio today some 30 years later. The legendary 'Suffragett City' is next with it's classic guitar riff and \\"hey-man\\" lyrics. This song as well as many of the other on the album is still to this day played on the radio. This song shows how Ziggy went solo only to find he was nothing with out the band and he becomes a brok burn-out. The last song on the album aside from being one of Bowie most heartfelt and best songs is also the perfect end to the legendary album. 'Rock N' Roll Suicide' ends the story with Ziggy killing his carear as well as himself. This song is a mini-epic in all the terms glory, it starts with a beautiful acoustic start and slowly builds to a hard rocker and leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />Disc to of this cd is out takes and tracks that were recorded for the album but were never used all of the demos and outtakes are nice but it's amazing to see how Bowie went from that to what he put on the album. 'John, I'm Only Dancing' was a Bowie single andis concidered a Bowie classic.  'Velvet Goldmine' is a great Bowie song and I dont knwo why it was left off the album it is just as good as all the other songs. 'Holy Holy' and Amsterdamn are both very good songs that also could have been on the album. 'The Supermen' here isnt as good as the one on The Man Who Sold The World. 'Round And Round' is a great Chuck Berry cover. 'Sweet Head' is just pure amazing, there is no other way to say it just amazing!<br /><br />The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars is with out a doubt one of the all time greatest rock and roll and pop albums of all time, do yourself a favor and pick up this amazing classic!and is concidered a Bowie classic.

B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica Mars is definitely the best teen oriented show, even adult oriented show to come out in the last year. You can't help but love Veronica, she just seems like the type of girl anyone could be friends with. Now, I know it is a good show because after looking through all the reviews I only found 3 bad ones, from people who are just plain STUPID!!! One of the reviews posted stupid little things that only someone too into details would notice, about the headlights on her car. Oh, and about rich kids going to public schools, it happens, trust me I knew some wealthy kids in my school. And to say this is like saying that non-rich kids can't go to private schools which is bull. Another dumb post mentioned that we should be watching something better, like The O.C. or One Tree Hill. Are you kidding me? Those shows are so unrealistic. When would so many of those things happen to one group of kids. Some of the situations in both those shows are overreacted, and it's not like we haven't seen shows like those before, Beverly Hills 90210 and Dawson's Creek for example. Veronica Mars is fresh, smart and just great. I know I will definitely be buying the first season on DVD and anxiously awaiting the second season.
B000040OBS|4.0|I'm no expert on this type of music but i am a big fan of pretty much all punkish/newwaveish music to come out of NYC in the 70's so it is obvious that i needed this for my collection. The thing i love about this scene is that, while it's all sort of blanketed under \\"punk\\", most of the bands sounded like anything but punk and the diversity was enormous. Each had their own great contribution to make and Suicide is no exception. These guys were so obviously ahead of their time (i have a friend who makes this sort of music now).

B00092ZMDY|4.0|Don Felder is sorely missed and the guy who replaced him, to me sounds, either off-key or 1 octave too high.     I have both Hell Freezes Over (HFO) and the Farewell I tour; both are very good, but if you have to choose between the 2, HFO is better because Eagles have all 5 of their star performers in HFO - Don Henley, Glen Frey, Timothy Schmidt, Joe Walsh and Don Felder. However Farewell I has lot more songs than HFO.
0425179877|4.0|...or at least a highly-detailed insight as to what happened, from the perspective of the man in the white vest who was sitting in the Flight Director's chair at the time?<br /><br />Then look elsewhere. (Jim Lovell's book, \\"Lost Moon\\" and the movie that it inspired, \\"Apollo 13\\" both feature much more detail about that ill-fated flight than Kranz does in \\"Failure.\\")<br /><br />That being said, it is STILL a very good book, although it can get a little tedious, given the overwhelming use of technical abbreviations. Many of them may be familiar to most people, (i.e., \\"CapCom\\" or the Capsule Communicator... who is the guy in Mission Control that actually TALKS to the astronauts), but there are plenty of others, (TLC... Trans-Lunar Coast; SPC... Stored Program Command) that are not generally used outside of a control room, and therefore serve to slow down the readers' comprehension.<br /><br />Former Flight Director Gene Kranz, (who was portrayed by Ed Harris in the aforementioned film \\"Apollo 13\\"), details much of his life, from his introduction to Mission Control at the dawn of the Space Age through the final Apollo 17 moon mission.<br /><br />The book is layed out chronologically, and perhaps BECAUSE most people know so much about the aborted Apollo 13 mission, he wastes very little time writing about it. For example, much more ink is devoted to the horrifying Apollo 1 disaster, in which three astronauts, Grissom, White, and Chaffee, were incinerated during a training exercise in the command module while it sat on the launch pad, firmly attached to the ground.<br /><br />He also provides interesting facts and stories for virtually every one of the Mercury and Gemini missions that led up to the Apollo project.<br /><br />One interesting tidbit of info that I knew as a kid, but had since forgotten... the longest Gemini missions lasted 14 days; longer than any of the Apollo missions. While that might not seem to be all that difficult a feat in light of the amount of space afforded modern astronauts, on the Gemini craft they were basically strapped into their seats for the ENTIRE two weeks. There was no getting up, floating around the cabin, ducking away for a bathroom break... nothing.<br /><br />Back then, they really did have to have \\"The Right Stuff\\" in order to endure the extremes they were subject to.<br /><br />And, thankfully, Kranz has taken the time to let us know what it was like to sit in the Director's chair, leading the United States through a momentous decade of exploration.amount of space afforded modern astronauts, on the Gemini craft they were basically strapped into their seats for the ENTIRE two weeks.

B000063DHK|5.0|This is a must for every Maiden fan. I bought this album just after it had been released in the mid 80`s, bust it`s still one of my favorit listenings more the 20 years later (altought I now have converted it to CD). The best part is that Maiden still are at their top - having just seen them at their \\"Eddie Rips up Europe\\" tour this summer: Amazing!!!
0634060384|5.0|This is finally an official published book that we have used for many years.  Finally time to get my own copy!
6305364648|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining action movies, and what makes it really appealing (beside special effects), is an interplay between well developed characters. The casting is first rate. Both Arnolds are terrific, exuding humor and special chemistry that often exists between opposite personalities. On a similar level is Tia Carrere. Art Malik skillfully hides his British accent behind Arabic one. I saw him years ago in some BBC TV production, and that was a memorable, subtle performance. He is excellent here too, although in a different way. Among other roles, my only disappointment turned out to be Harry's wife (and perhaps the daughter too - must be genetic). If almost every other character in the movie is larger than life, Helen Tasker is rather ordinary, and remains such even after the life transforming experience in the middle of the feature. Such normalcy puts her at odds with the rest of the ensemble. This may not be entirely Curtis' fault, however, but the result of overextended writing, which, in her case, drags the action.  It seems that the creators of this film in their rush to produce another AS box-office hit did not expect it to come out so well, or they would have tightened the plot and plugged a few holes in it. Despite that, the highest recommendation is still in order.
B00004U8JV|1.0|I remember how disappointed I was when I first saw the movie (in the theaters).  I recently read the book (I've been on a Michael Crichton kick). Anyway...the book gets a 4 or 4.5 star rating!   <br /> <br />I can't believe Michael Crichton actually allowed this farce to have the name \\"The Lost World\\" when they are nothing alike.  There are over 30 people in the movie, only 3 of which are in the book.  From this, you should easily guess that the plots are totally different.  I won't tell you more, because I want you all to read the book! <br /> <br />Three cheers to Crichton -- a Bronx cheer to Spielberg. <br /> <br />BTW -- I did the book on tape while in the car. George Guidall (narrator) is excellent (as usual). <br />
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Constantine is a horrible movie. The first hour of it is just unexplained occurrences.  In a movie, it is good for things to be unexplained at the beginning and gradually explain themselves as the movie goes on, but when it goes on for an hour, you get bored and stop caring about the characters.  Then when this happens you can't tell when the movie starts to pick up.  Then, no matter what happens in the movie you don't care and it becomes a long boring escapade.  None of the characters interested me because I didn't think any of them were well done and as I said before, it needs to explain some stuff earlier in the movie and when that doesn't happen the more unexplained events that go on just add on to those before, so you stop trying to keep track of it all and that's when I stopped caring.  It would be a form of torture if someone made me sit through this movie again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I do not own a TV, so I first saw this show on DVD. Why a network would cancel a quality show like Firefly boggles my mind. The driving force behind this project was a combination of elements that all network shows hope for: great writing, an excellent cast, great direction, great music, and fabulous FX.  This show is way above other sci-fi shows still on the air!
B0001I561E|5.0|The reason why I favor this better then the Lion is I like to see a different race hit the animation business it not everyday you see Arab cartoons.

B000002P5R|5.0|\\"First Ray of the New Rising Sun\\" is a compilation of some the strongest material released on the 3 posthumous albums \\"The Cry of Love\\", \\"Rainbow Bridge\\" and \\"War Heroes\\". The recordings date from 1968-70, and were intended for a new double album Hendrix was working on at the time of his sad and tragic death in Sept. 1970.<br /><br />Though Hendrix probably would have given most of these new recordings a final touch before letting them go for release, they are in no way in unfinished or demo form. On the contrary they sound completely finished and ready for release, and match with the best material on his first three studio albums.<br /><br />Great drummer Mitch Mitchell and and bass-player Billy Cox are backing Jimi on most tracks, but other people like Buddy Miles, Steve Winwood, Chris Wood, Stephen Stills, Juma Sultan and The Ghetto Fighter make appearances.<br /><br />Though Hendrix's music generally was going in a new direction compared to \\"Electric Ladyland\\" (slightly more funky/jazzy), there are still many songs that would have fit into the old Experience concept. Among this type of songs \\"Angel\\", \\"My Friend\\", \\"Hey Baby\\" and \\"Drifting\\" stand out.<br /><br />The \\"new\\" Hendrix sound is displayed best by strong recordings like \\"Freedom\\", \\"Ezy Rider\\", \\"Night Bird Flying\\" ( A little Steve Miller in that one!) and \\"Dolly Dagger\\".<br /><br />Conclusion: This is a fine final chapter to the recording history of a uniquely talented and influential guitarist. Containing the complete tracks of \\"The Cry of Love\\" and some of the best material from \\"Rainbow Bridge\\" and \\"War Heroes\\", this CD easily compares with<br /><br />Hendrix' original studio albums.

B000063KG6|5.0|These expanded remastered TYA releases are all great for their fans and certainly add a lot to the old releases as far as additional tracks with beautiful packaging and wonderful ruminations and photos with commentary by Ric Lee,their drummer..their debut was a pretty traditional moody self titled blues rock cd, their 2nd was a wonderful exciting Blues Jazzier live set called Undead recorded in a small UK club atmosphere, while this experimental 3rd offering brings the band into the studio creating a rich sound scape of some great rocking blues songs,traces of jazz,scat,all mixed with a touch of psychedelia..The CD is sounds well produced and ranks in style the likes of early Pink Floyd,Soft Machine and Traffic in it's mode of experimentation.<br />The bonus selections and inclusion of I'm Going Home and an additional version of the rocker Hear Me Calling (later covered by Slade on their Alive album) makes  this  a wonderful release from this band of blues travellers whose Woodstock appearance and love of the blues with serious musicianship throughout their live puts them in a category of one of the great UK bands of the day.
B00005JKHP|3.0|There's little argument that Robert Wise's belated \\"director's cut\\" of \\"Star Trek - The Motion Picture\\" is an improvement over the original 1979 release. However, this big-screen debut represents the weakest (and slowest) of the series, partially redeemed by some awe-inspiring visual effects and Jerry Goldsmith's classic score. The camaraderie between Kirk, Spock and McCoy is sadly lacking, while the remaining Enterprise players are overshadowed by the unnecessary addition of Captain Decker (a horrible performance from Stephen Collins). Luckily, you can hit the warp-speed button during the film's several \\"longueurs,\\" which Wise should have pared down even further. Though flawed, \\"Star Trek - The Motion Picture\\" succeeds as a preview of better voyages to come.

0823016714|5.0|This book is a must buy for any artist. The variety of expressions and models is awesome and I particularly like the photos taken at low and high angles. I also like the way the book is organized. It's perfect to have expressions grouped by person because when I'm drawing a character I need to see how that character's expressions look. As fascinating as the photos are of different people, the artwork inspired be each model is so creative! The galleries in the back of the book of a kissing couple, phonemes, and models wearing hats are an invaluable resource.
B000002UAR|5.0|Beginning with \\"Rubber Soul,\\" the Beatles transcended pop music, and continued their ascension with \\"Revolver.\\"  With this album, they began to experiment more with the studio.  On this album, however, we also see the beginnings of the individuals voices of the Beatles (which were blended up through \\"Rubber Soul\\").  That being said, this album kicks off with Harrison's \\"Taxman,\\" one of the few Beatles kick ass rock songs (check out McCartney's bass playing).  From there, the album moves into McCartney's existential \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" Lennon's lazy hazy \\"I'm Only Sleeping,\\" and back to Harrison, with the sitar driven \\"Love You Too.\\"  This album finds McCartney honing his unbelievable pop skills with \\"Good Day Sunshine,\\" \\"Here, There, and Everywhere,\\" and \\"For No One,\\" while Lennon contributes the drug influenced \\"He Said, She Said,\\" \\"Dr. Robert,\\" and \\"And Your Bird Can Sing.\\"  Everytime the Beatles released music, critics claimed there was nowhere else to go.  After this album, there was only one way to go...up.

B000002KHH|4.0|I'd rather listen to either the S/t or \\"Master of Reality\\", but that doesn't detract from the fact that this is one of the most important and groundbreaking rock releases, one that virtually defined the genre of heavy metal (along with Led Zeppelin's first album). Aside from Zeppelin, nobody at the time played the same style of mutant and sludgely blues rock that Sabbath excelled in. While everyone else was singing meaningless songs about peace and love, Sabbath tackled themes that were important. In addition to sci-fi and supernatural songs, there are songs dealing with war particulary, making it clear this is coming from a pacifist point of view. One of the main components that makes this album work is the lack of any overt filler. After a while, the three most popular songs on the album (\\"War Pigs\\", \\"Parinoid\\", and \\"Iron Man\\") sound just as good as the rest. The best song on this album would have to be \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\" which illustrates why stoners love Black Sabbath. A good and essential if slightly overrated album.

B0009W5K0Y|5.0|Paramore's debut record, \\"All We Know Is Falling,\\" which is distributed by Fueled By Ramen Records, is a solid release. Not many bands in this genre of music have accomplished what Paramore has. This band has fused pop-punk with heart felt lyrics all sung by Hayley Williams. <br /> <br />Not being a fan of many female lead singers, I was skeptical when I first heard this album. However, her voice and the melodies from the other band members will have you won over on the first listen. <br /> <br />This album opens up strong with the track \\"All We Know,\\" which is also the first single. The track starts with a drum hit and in come the guitars at full force. From the first time the listener hears Hayley's voice to the end of the album, the listener will be amazed at her range of vocals and how well the band harmonizes with her. The video for this song, directed and edited by Dan Dobi, showcases the raw energy Paramore puts into their live show. With various clips of the band performing, the viewer sees how passionate they are towards their music and how much fun they have together. <br /> <br />The third track on the album, \\"Emergency,\\" is by far the strongest track on the album. This is hard to say, since 90% of the album contains radio singles. The tracks starts stating, \\"I think we have an emergency, I think we have an emergency.\\" This song is one that hits hard with the listener. It talks about seeing someone suffer during a tough break up. The lyrics, \\"I've seen love die way too many times, when it deserves to be alive, I've seen you cry way too many times, when you deserve to be alive,\\" are one of the more profound lines sung on the album. Some albums contain lyrics that just make one think, and this is one of theme. How many times has someone close been affected by heartache and shut down? <br /> <br />Halfway through the album, there is the one song that will have you trying to sing the chorus after the first time it is heard. \\"Here We Go Again\\" opens with a thumping guitar line that runs throughout the song. There is not a weak moment in this entire track. When Haley belts out, \\"I'll write you just to let you know that I'm alright, can't say I'm sad to see you go,\\" one wonders if she has been screwed over by someone. Even though the lyrics to this track may be those of heartache, this track is a perfect song to drive along to and just lose yourself in. <br /> <br />The next track, \\"Whoa,\\" will leave you in awe. This track is the poppiest track on the album, which is not a bad thing at all. You will be singing along due to its catchiness. The chorus will smack you, due to the fact that the verses are a little more serious. \\"We've got every one singin' whoa, whoa.\\" Even the band knows everyone will be singing along with their album, as well as this track. With the poppy music and sing-a-long lyrics, the band has outdone themselves with a song that will be stuck in your head for days. <br /> <br />\\"Franklin\\" seems to be the most emotional track on the record. This song is one of the slowest paced tracks on the album and showcases the true talent of the band. With lyrics about missing their hometown and feeling out of place, anyone that has moved can truly relate. Due to the dual vocal track on this song, the listener can hear both Hayley and Josh singing different lines over each other. The layered effect really adds to the track. The raw emotion makes this track stand out from the others. <br /> <br />Finally comes the closing song, \\"My Heart.\\" On this track, one thing stands out that will blow the listeners mind. The song opens very mellow like many of the other tracks. During parts of this song however, the band's love for metal and screamo is shown. There is screaming during parts of the song, which may catch people off guard due to the mellowness of the rest of the album. This screaming actually adds to the dynamics of the record, once again showcasing the talent that these teenagers have. <br /> <br />\\"All We Know Is Falling\\" is a solid record, considering half the band is under age 17. They write lyrics better than some of the emo bands out there now and the sound of the instruments is stunning. Fueled By Ramen has picked up a band that will be huge. If you are looking for one CD to buy before the summer is over, this is it. There is nothing else on the market that has the passion and talent that this record contains. Once you begin to listen, it will be an album that will not come out of the CD player.

B0000584TJ|4.0|Originally released in 1972, by this short-lived project. Even though it's not as mind-blowing as Steve Hillage's earlier one-time group effort, Arzachel (see my review) it's still a good disc to own a copy of. Nicely done / obscure progressive art rock title. Took me a while to get a copy of this reissue, but was worth the wait. Key tracks are the nine minute title cut \\"Space Shanty\\", the airy and sometime even spaced out \\"Mixed Up Man Of The Mountain\\" and \\"Stargazers\\". Line-up: Hillage - guitar & vocals, Nick Greenwood - bass & vocals, Dave Stewart (keyboardist for Egg) - piano, organ & marimbas and Eric Peachey - drums. A should-have for most Gong and Hillage fans.

B0007OCG4W|3.0|On the back of the Closer DVD jacket, there's a quote from Time saying \\"at last, a love story for adults.\\"  Obviously, Time watched the wrong movie because if there is one thing this movie is definitely not about, it's love.  These four characters are among the most amoral, dysfunctional human beings (and I use the term lightly) I've ever encountered.  The sad thing is that there are probably some people out there who act just like them.  This is a truly uncomfortable film to watch; it's crude, lewd, and dripping with misery from start to finish.  And the director, not satisfied at merely making you ashamed to be a human being, throws in a bonus in the form of something I found completely inexplicable at the very end.<br /><br />I don't know why Jude Law keeps playing pitiful losers, but he's certainly quite good at it.  The character of Dan comes right from the very bottom of the barrel.  He's a would-be novelist who seemingly falls crazy in love with Alice (Natalie Portman) after his very presence makes her walk out in front of a moving car.  Ah, this is Fate doing its thing, you think - until he puts the moves on Anna (Julia Roberts), a photographer he has just met.  Anna rebuffs his advances - sort of, and Dan gets back at her by playing a moronic (not to mention filthy) joke, which, strangely enough, brings a perverted dermatologist named Larry (Clive Owen) into her life.  Dan still lusts after Anna, even after she's married Owen, and eventually Anna and Dan fall in mutual lust and break up both couples.  This is not to say that Alice and Owen are innocent, as they engage in all kinds of perversions of their own.  To its credit, the movie doesn't exactly let everyone live happily ever after - which is good because none of these characters deserves one moment of happiness.<br /><br />The film is somewhat strange in that major shifts in the relationships take place off-screen; we're going along one path, and then all of a sudden we're told that we've actually been going the other direction for months and months.  The interrelationships of these four people shift more often than the plates around the San Andreas Fault - with most of the action taking place beneath the surface.  The results are emotional earthquakes that leave everything dirty and unsettled, with no solid ground upon which to build anew.  The emotional wreckage of these people's lives is not a pretty sight by any stretch of the imagination.  The acting in the film is top-notch, but the story makes Closer quite a miserable, disturbing thing to watch.her direction for months and months.

B000055Y0X|4.0|Upon a nuclear attack on the Soviets ordered by the mad general (Sterling Hayden), the President (Peter Sellers) and the generals (most notably George C. Scott) had an important meeting at the Pentagon to resolve the crisis.    George C. Scott was the man to see in the film. He had great speeches to make and his convictions were unfaltered right to the end. Peter Sellers (as the President, the aide captain to the mad general as well as the ex-Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove) was everywhere in the film. I never saw Peter Sellers in such a serious role as the President.  The most impressive shot is the one when the military man riding on the bomb down to USSR.    Many parts of the film was documentary like, deliberatley so. But I can't help noticing that(1) 18 minutes before the bomb was to be on USSR soil, the Presidents of the 2 countries were still exchanging pleasantries on the phone. (2) the man on the falling bomb was holding in a position most convenient for the camera but defying gravity nevertheless. (3) the captain (Peter Sellers) could manage to phone the President from a military base. All these begged disbelief and contributed the comical/cynical elements to the film, they were more symbolic than anything else.     A film with sarcastic, dark moments and an ending to be pondered.
B000006TRV|5.0|What's not to like.  Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" is a classic that only got better when remastered.  Anyone who loves rock should have this in their cd collection.
0525457585|4.0|Bastian Balthazar Bux is a fat, lonely boy who seems like a bit of a screwball to the kids in his school. So one rainy day when he was running away from them, he hid in a bookstore. There he found a fabulous book called The Neverending Story. Tempted by the promise that this book would never end (who doesn't want a book that won't stop before you find out just what exactly the author means by \\"happily ever after\\"?) Bastian steals the book and runs with it to school. On the way he is mortified by what he's just done. He decides he can never go home again, because he's a criminal. He climbs to the school attic and locks himself in with only his lunch and the Neverending Story to sustain him. <br />   This is a story of adventure, of truth, of friendship, of joy, of hope, of despair, of power, of self-esteem, of humility, of pride, of wisdom, of mistakes, of, of... of everything! <br />   The Neverending Story is the circle of life, is what I believe the author was trying to say. That's the main idea I gleaned from the mountain of allegory in this dazzling, thought-provoking story.  <br />  The other major theme is love, which becomes extremely clear only at the end of the book. But all of the aforementioned themes were in the book, one after another, drawing you back for more. This book is not for fun, although its characters and locales are so wierd and beautiful that it often is fun. <br />   The prose is powerful because it is so stark. I'm not saying there wasn't enough description. Rather, there was the perfect amount of description, and no excess. You have to use your imagination to see the described things, but you never have to fill in uncomfortable blanks. One small thing I found confusing was the way the author describes sounds. He seemed almost...well, inept at that. For example, he says that a stone-eating giant with buckteeth \\"crackled\\" words out, instead of saying he had a gravelly voice or whatever he could have meant by that. He also describes a dragon's voice sounding like a bronze bell, but that's a bit easier for me to imagine. <br />  The book is extremely long for a children's novel, but every word counts, so careful reading is a must. Nonetheless, I was so absorbed in the story that I finished it in two days!  <br />   There are some theories in the book that are absolutely mind-blowing. For example, while Bastian is inside the story, someone mentions to him that perhaps someone else is reading the story that he's in. It sent a chill down my spine, because while he had been reading a book by the selfsame title, he had been blasted into its pages! For a split second those words give you the feeling that the same could happen to you! If you don't believe me, try it. It's freaky.
B00005JKES|5.0|I love Twin Peaks!  That being said, I was so delighted to experience the crisp, clear transfer of the audio and video, as well as all the extras.  After watching the whole series from the pilot through the series and the movie Fire Walk With Me, I like all the little details you notice, like the references to owls and the interactions between characters.  I enjoy this campy stuff, and despite the series only lasting two seasons with a hell of a cliffhanger ending that leaves Peakies wanting more, I suggest you buy this awesome collection.  AND IF THEY RELEASE SEASON TWO WITH AS GREAT OF A TRANSFER AS THIS ONE, THAT WOULD MAKE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAPPY.

It was good, but not THAT good. I can't even tell you what it's about. I say this is a good time-filler, but other then that, it isn't really all that good.
B0002VEXUA|2.0|If you already have this album on CD there isn't much point in buying this unless you simply can't live without it. I was extremely disappointed. I had thought it had a 5.1 soundtrack which is what the UK reviews indicated. Turns out that the Region 4 release only has PCM stereo and Dolby 2.0. Since the extras are thing you watch only once or twice, it is hard to recommend it. If you do decide to buy it, make sure your version has the 5.1 soundtrack!
B000066C6Z|3.0|I did not know what to expect when watching this for the first time. I had seen this video around for sale before, but I had no idea it was by the Zucker Brothers and Jim Abraham. And upon inspection of the credits etc.. and saw it was made in 1984! The cover made it look like a modern day movie, but I'm glad I finally got to see it.    Top secret is typical Zucker/Abraham humor like there other films, Airplane(flying high), Naked Gun & Kentucky Fried Movie. This one however may not be the funniest movie they have done, but it is the funniest movie about a rocker from America who goes to Germany to be the first ever rocker allowed to perform in the country, but ends up tangled up with a woman who is the head of the underground rebellion and there mishap adventures continue from there.    What I really liked about the film was how it was shot in 84, yet it looks like a huge Hollywood blockbuster from the 50's or 60's. Huge stages and looks very 'classic' in it's appearance. It really is a wonderful job in shooting it and the scenery and backgrounds are very nice... and that's coming from someone who never gives a s#!~ about that kind of stuff!!!! IMO it deserves an award for it, you just don't see those kind of things anymore these days.    Overall, the comedy is definitely there. It is funny, whacky and crazy as you expect from the Z-Z-A trio. But what really surprises me is how the 3 of them don't seem to like the film very much from there audio commentary. They said the movie did nothing when it was released but has done well in the rental market! They say it's 'cause you can fast forward the slow bits and get to the interesting part and watch a 30 minute movie... nah, i thought it paced OK, so i dunno what there on about it. it probably just went up against something else that took all the focus off this one.    Overall, it's a great film for what it is. Guaranteed to make the Airplane/naked gun/KFM fans laugh.
B00000JBCP|5.0|Man&aacute; is one of the better known and talented recording artists to come out of Latin America in recent years. This particular CD contains a recording from MTV Unplugged of some of the group's best songs. In particular, some of Mana's most impressive tracks include the live versions of their hits:<br /><br />-En el Muelle de San Blas<br /><br />-Perdido en un Barco<br /><br />-Te Solt&eacute; la Rienda<br /><br />From very high energy to slower melodies, the music is a tremendous represenation of Rock en Espa&ntilde;ol with catchy latin rhythms combined with the best influences of modern rock. You don't need to speak Spanish to appreciate the music on this CD. Buy it and you'll enjoy it.
B000001E3L|5.0|Probably the best 'live' album I've ever heard. The band is incredible, the flow of the music is incredible, the energy and sense of enjoyment released by Van and all of the performers is incredible. Much of the set consists of extended versions of Morrison's own songs augmented by fragments of tunes made famoud by others, such as snippets of 'It's All In The Game', and 'It's A Man's World'. This approach of 'sampling' from other styles and genres works beautifully and this astonishing group of musicians will make you feel like you are sitting in the first row. Crank up the volume or the headphones and transport yourself into the middle of a Van Morrison concert. Awesome.
B000002UAU|4.0|it's heresy to admit it, but some of the songs are mediocre, especially playing alongside cuts that are arguably at the apex of 20th century music. day in the life? incredible. lovely rita? please don't make me ever hear it again. within you without you? beyond incredible. mr. kite? oh, dear. she's leaving home? stunningly beautiful. with a little help from my friends? sorry, not a classic. it's about 75% as great as everyone says, and 25% not just 'not great', but not even typically beatles good.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is a short review...well sort of <br /> <br />London Calling by the Clash is undoubtedly on of the best records of all time.  There may be some of of you who want to bicker and argue about you it, but you can NOT deny the fact that this album and the band itself laid down many ideals and principles that many popular to this day follow. <br /> <br />For one reason their music and lyrics were well thought out and well said .  May they have been singing about the hardships and issues of living in 1970s London *London Calling* or poking fun at the coca cola cocaine scandal *Koka Kola*, at least the lyrics told a story and left you walking away with feeling something (may it be humourous or just plain good).   Also I LOVED the way they experimented with ALL types of music, which many bands aren't daring enough to do.  Many bands stick to the same style and after a while it gets boring, like  The Sex Pistols.  Granted they made some good songs, but their music was always so angry and they never derived from anything else. At least the Clash was willing to take a risk. <br /> <br />London Calling really is the perfect \\"mix cd\\". The Clash takes you through such diverse music genres *from punk to rockabilly to reggae to ska to r&b* What more could you ask for? <br /> <br />For the person who hated the Clash's \\"ham-fisted\\" attempts at reggae, fyi, even joe strummer didn't think that their reggae was the greatest, but they did it anyway because it was what they loved *and god bless them for it*

B0002858YS|4.0|I'ld just like to say that this is not a bad little rock album, you can hear influences from The Pixies,The Cure, Bowie, Placebo, Suede, even U2 on occasion, with numerous other influences all through it. They wear these influences on their sleeves, that is for sure, but this album is a good little production all the same. The songs are quite good, and it should be noted that there is not many 'fillers' on the album at all, so you get your money's worth with this one.   The second or third playing really gets this album in its groove, and this album became a mainstay in my car stereo for several months after I first purchased it.  The Killers have made an excellent debut, and this album has turned out to be one of the best rock releases during the past year. I hope they can keep it up with subsequent works, and if this album is anything to go by the next one will be great as well.    Check it out for yourself to see what all the fuss is about!
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Ah, Slipknot.  They are the band everyone loves to hate.  As Anatole France once said, \\"If 50 million people believe a foolish thing, it is still a foolish thing.\\"  The same applies here.  Just because every goth kid goes around wearing their shirts doesn't mean they are a great metal band.  I had to find out for myself if they really worth listening to.  I have never liked them, since the days that the goth kids in middle school started listening to them.  The music does nothing to impress me.  After having heard the old stuff and compared it to this I can figure out one thing about this band-they are nothing but trend following posers.  Seriously, I have nothing against bands that make changes in their sound from album to album(e.g. Opeth is one of my favorite bands), but these guys seemed to have felt the need to do something different to keep up with the changing trends of the mainstream mallcore crowd.  So what do they do?  Seeing as how shred is making a comeback they add guitar solos and, to make themselves seem like more credible songwriters and I guess to get some appeal from the emocore crowd, they write some acoustic stuff.    All this aside, lets look at the musicians themselves:  Vocals - Corey is the biggest whiney boy.  His clean singing is mediocre at best; there is much better out there(for instance, every power metal singer in existance).  His screaming flat out sucks.  I always get a laugh out of how he likes to start out on a lower volume and build up, like in the bridge of duality.  It seems almost pathetic, how he can barely get any distortion into his voice.    Guitars - Ah, so they actually CAN play their instruments.  Impressive?  Hardly.  There are solos and shreddy parts on Opium Of The People, Welcome, Vermillion, and Pulse Of The Maggots, however, they are nothing that hasn't been done before, only better.  It just shows that all they care about is following trends.    Bass - They might as well not have a bassist at all, because he doesn't add anything.  No runs, no fills, no slaps, and he plays with a pick!    Drums - All I've ever heard about Joey Jordison is how he is the \\"best metal drummer ever.\\"  Sure he's fast, and he does a lot of double bass, but he's hardly one of the best.  That is reserved for such people as Flo Mournier, Pete Sandoval, Hellhammer, Richard Christy, Gene Hoglan, and Sean Reinert.    Everything else - All the other \\"musicians\\" in the band are there for is the whole gimmick of Slipknot, just like the masks are.  They add nothing and without them the band would sound the same, if not better.
0802136834|5.0|A very fascinating read.  So superlatively and richly written  I felt that I was transported back in time.  Colorful characters, intrigue, murder, politics--I could NOT put it down.  I will read this book again.  Fantastic!
B0002DB52M|5.0|Following the distinguished traces of his previous six generations literary herald: Henrik Ibsen (A people's enemy) and a smart blending with an amazing and enrapturing vision of the purest spirit of the Greek Tragedy, it is not a mere casualty that Lars von Triers had employed a theatrical stage, to induce the viewer to add the necessary amount of febrile imagination; even in the simplest actions as open a door or cultivate flowers in a non existent garden.<br />The monumental process of overpowering crumbling of the artificial bonhomie, good will and superficiality of this peaceful and apparently inoffensive community of Dogville, will be falling down in a anguishing dropping of improper actions, false promises, tantalizing situations that culminate with that brutal rape. Under these considerations we will become silent witness of  abominable corporal abuses and physical sadism, double moral behaviors, acid comments under the holly blanket of dogmatism and religious fervor (the sordid sequence in which the bells mask the aggression is simply magisterial).<br />Triers, to my mind is one of the most gifted directors in the world actually: In my previous review about Zentropa (1992) I remarked his visual and storytelling innovations. And Dogville represents (at the present moment, because with the genius the definitive statement is never possible), the supreme summit of his original career.<br />I hope you agree with me when I say that Triers reached the cathartic state at the end of the film, without stylized concessions or intellectual pretensions. And considering the fact the elapsed time is 170 min. the wholeness of the human soul (with all its imaginable and glittering morbidity and rotten nakedness) was showed with all its tempestuous rage with a minimum of resources, but talent in its highest level.

B0001DI0FI|4.0|Widescreen.  Exceptional extras on the second disc of this two-disc DVD set.  The deleted scenes and featurettes are extremely interesting and well-done.  The best of these is the \\"Hundred Days\\" documentary which chronicles each step of the making of the film.  Covers everything from adapting the book to Weir's painstaking attention to preserving the authenticity of the period.  A look into the superb casting, shooting at sea, visual effects, and composing the score.  A great gift for fans of Peter Weir.
1401200605|3.0|I don't read many comics and I had no problems following this.  So this is a good place to jump in and read a superhero comic if you want to read one but not get all pulled into the DC Universe.  The drawback is that maybe this would have a bit much rehash if you read tons of comics.  That's just speculation, since I'm not in that category.    The plot here concerns a ransom of the freckled faced son of the head of a chemical corporation.  Naturally Batman rescues the boy, but as he ties up the bad guys and checks the boy out Catwoman snatches the ransom he has just recovered.  It turns out that she is in this case innocent and that she and the kidnapper, Killer Croc, who is in fact a giant human/chameleon combination, have both been duped by the real mastermind.  Batman and Catwoman join up to find his or her identity and recover the money.  Along the way they kiss.  Catwoman doesn't stress about it but Batman spends as much mental energy trying to figure her out as he does trying to discover the identity of the villain behind the kidnapping.  (Book 1 doesn't finish the main plot or the romantic plot or even any of the maybe 5 subplots it cracks open either, so you will be left hanging if you don't also have access to Book 2.  Overall it seems like a consistent and safe series, so this is not a problem.)    The graphics here are well done.  Each page is drawn, shaded and colored well.  There is really good consistency from page to page.  At the same time this is not a must see.  New ground is not being broken and the layouts are adequate but not working too hard.     Overall this is an adequate comic.  The graphics are well done, not breath taking.  The plot is a vehicle for fights and showing off super powers but still has some nifty twists.  If you get this book you won't feel ripped off, but you also aren't going to be amazed by anything new.  The best use for this is maybe to try and introduce someone to the characters.  Like if you think Batman is sooo cool and you want to give your 10 year old kid some exposure, then this is the book for you.  The comic is clean (plenty of black PVC clad pin up super girls and two little kisses, but nothing more).  If you do get it then also get Book 2, since this one ends on a cliffhanger.
B000000W6F|3.0|I love the Pumpkins. Listen to \\"Gish\\", and you can see the rise of a terrific band. It's good music, but it hardly compares to \\"Siamese Dream\\" or \\"Melancolly and Infinite Sadness\\". If you are a fan of the band, you will appreciate this CD. My personal favorite is \\"I am One\\". Although it's not their musical peak (hence 3 stars), it is worth your time and money.
B00004Z459|5.0|Ah! Just like the title says, I'm so glad I disregarded the fact that Linkin Park integrates rap into their music! I have never been a fan of rap. In fact, I could even say that I find most of it a bit unbearable to listen to. However, Linkin Park's form of rap is much more agreeable than your typical rap. It doesn't feel quite as aggressive or angry and, unlike most other rap, it doesn't make me cringe. In fact, I can now say that I love Linkin Park's rap. Their music wouldn't be as good without it!   <br /> <br />That aside, boy, am I glad I settled down on purchasing Hybrid Theory! I had heard Linkin Park's song \\"Papercut\\" as the background music in a flash movie compilation (the first time I'd ever actually heard anything by Linkin Park) and thought that it kicked butt, so I did a search here at amazon and found that there were several Linkin Park albums that contained the song \\"Papercut.\\" After listening to the samples provided by this site (thank you, amazon), I found that Hybrid Theory's version of \\"Papercut\\" was the most pleasing to my ear and was the one that was used in the aforementioned flash movie. I also found the other songs on Hybrid Theory to be more attractive than the ones on some of the other albums I previewed. Of course, for many of the songs, the samples don't do justice. You've got to hear them to their fullest to be able to appreciate their greatness. <br /> <br />Anyways, I decided to risk the fact that I'd never purchased any music quite like this sort before and bought Hybrid Theory. I absolutely love this album. It is my favorite music album I own and I never get tired of listening to it. My favorite songs are \\"Papercut\\" (of course), \\"In the End\\", \\"One Step Closer\\", \\"Runaway\\", and \\"By Myself.\\" Love 'em. They are all filled with the action-packed hard rock/heavy-metal music that I adore and the lyrics are pretty good - sometimes a bit nonsensical though (The dude sounds a bit delusional in \\"Papercut\\" :D - very cool.) All the other songs are quite enjoyable as well and none of them are too slow for me, which I greatly appreciate. I'd also like to mention that there's not one swear word on the entire album and the only content that I find that could be considered even remotely offensive is the screaming \\"Shut up!\\"s that the singer does in \\"One Step Closer\\" and in \\"A Place for My Head.\\" However, I actually find them quite amusing, and the songs wouldn't be as fun without them.  <br /> <br />There's a great combination of metal and hip-hop going on in Linkin Park's music and that's what makes it so great. While hip-hop isn't normally my thing, I like what Linkin Park does with it in their music. It adds a tasty variety to their music and blends in well with the metal style which dominates the majority of their songs. Most of the songs on this album are primarily of the metal genre with the main singer's forceful (even screaming) vocals doing most of the lyrical work, but also contain a lot of intervals which include the hip-hop style music and the rapping. The merging of the genres yeilds a superb product, in my opinion. Very enjoyable. The only track on this album that sounds purely like hip-hop to me is \\"Cure for the Itch,\\" which is conveniently the only track that doesn't contain any singing or rapping. What do you know, I even like this track. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I love this album and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes hard rock/heavy metal. Even if you don't like rap, give it a chance; you may end up coming to appreciate rap as I did through this album. Also, if you like this album, may I also suggest checking out Evanescence's album \\"Fallen.\\" Evanescence uses a more dark and haunting style of heavy metal than Linkin Park does, but it also kicks butt. Evanescence also doesn't contain any rap or hip-hop, so if you're still having trouble getting over the fact that Linkin Park contains that, then \\"Fallen\\" may be more the thing for you. I've also recently discovered the band Hoobastank,which I'm also liking. Check out their album \\"The Reason.\\" They've got some good stuff too.

B0007CNXUK|3.0|Johnny Depp plays a guy named James Matthew Barrie, who is a guy who writes plays, and not too many people like them. Later in the movie, he is claimed to be Peter Pan. That's really all this movie is about. I just have one question about Peter Pan...why is he always played by a woman?? Answer:I don't know. Maybe it just seems right, but not to me. Basically, this movie had barely anything to do with Neverland. Even though that is the case, there is one scene where Kate Winslet is shown Neverland. That's about it, and they talk a whole lot about stuff like it and James Matthew Barrie was saying to \\"Believe\\" at the end. I didn't think this was awful. Only alright. It's worth seeing.
038572179X|4.0|Excellent descriptive detail of a young girl's imaginative, creative world in England during the 1930-40's.  So much detail (and little story line) may seem a bit slow-going for some readers.
B0009S4IHY|1.0|As the title says, this is by no means a bad film, no. Not at all. In fact, I'd sincerely reccomend this disc if it weren't for one fatal flaw: SONY CENSORED THE FILM. Yes, that's correct. Despite its \\"R\\" rating, Sony still felt it necessary to defile this masterpiece of a movie through pointless edits. I ask you, don't support Sony and buy this! Get the import if you still can, but whatever you do, don't let Sony see one red cent!
0060930187|4.0|<br />A portrait of madness written with a light touch. Breathtaking, sad and timeless. A must read for lovers of personal literature of the 20th century.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Dylan's follow up to Time Out of Mind is just as good. Though not as lyrically great as Time Out of Mind, it is a musical masterpiece. The production by Jack Frost is top notch as always. The songs are well written just some are better than others. The guitar on this album is used exceptionally well. Favorites include Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum, Mississippi, Lonesome Day Blues, Floater (Too Much To Ask), High Water (for Charlie Patton), Honest With Me, Po' Boy, and Cry A While. Highly Recommended. Came out on 9/11.
0375805613|4.0|This is one of my 2 1/2 daughter's favorites. It is funny and cute.
B0000640VO|2.0|I would have loved this movie without Amelie. I would love a love story or a drama about the real often middle aged or older people in this movie confronting their lives and their loves and their pain, and finding something to sustain themselves in the real grind of life, not in the actions of an ignorant girl with no respect for other people.<br /><br />  This is a very artificial movie. It dresses itself up in supposed quirkiness, it claims to be romantic but it is not about what real love or even friendship is about, real people knowing each other, liking each other, sharing their humanity, real people living in life.<br /><br />  Essentially, the character Amelie is a person with no social skills, no real friends, and no experience in life or love, and little desire. Yet, she sets herself up with no experience to disturb the happiness and pattern of other people by lying, trying to fix people up with others who are not really interested in each other, and theft.  She steals precious letters from her father to fabricate lies for her concierge--is it an emotional problem you cant be more faithful to your father than to a stranger.<br /><br />  The character Amelie really has not respect or faith in the humanity of other people. She only sees them as good or bad, and from a position of ignorance of life breaks into people's homes and steals things, doctor's people's food and medical supplies to cause them wrong, etc. etc.  All of this without trying to find out why people feel the way she does, even though her own life from conception is treated with understanding and explanation for her supposed pain.<br /><br />  Amelie ultimately falls in love with a man whose work she steals for a period of time and does not seriously, promptly or courteously attempt to return to him.  Instead, she ferrets out the secrets of his work, and then forces him to go through all kinds of twists and turns and running and climbing up and down hills that would cause a normal person a heart attack.<br /><br />  For what?  She doesn't know him.  Nothing meaningful is revealed in his work but obsession.  What does she love, a person?  Or is it that this movie is supposed to be a love story but the author and directors don't know how to talk about real love and real life, so they artificially produce it give this film a plot, when it really has not much of one.<br /><br />  At the close of the movie, he comes to her house, she prevents him from speaking to her--having seen him once or twice without saying anything--and they make love.  Then they are seem going through Paris on her motorbike, her father, despite the purloined letters of his love being stolen, decides to travel the world which never has done before, etc.<br /><br />  This movie is nothing but the fantasy of the author and director that isolates love and happiness from real life.  A character is created who in essence has no life--curiously before she does all this she is shown not to be interested in boy friends and romance--and no real aspirations.  We learn, a bit surprised, that she just wants love in the abstract or so we are told after being told that she doesn't. Nothing really convinces her that she should. The film simply relies on the fact that we are inserted in a discourse of realizing that movies with attractive young women are love stories.  The assumption is that completion in life for women is only love with a hunking handsome moveie actor type of man. We note all other men except the lover she choses without hearing or speaking a word to him are middle aged or disfigured or ancient.  Her treatment of other people really ranges from the greatest rudeness and manipulation to crime.  I have always thought love involved accepting the humanity of others and realizing that your own humanity can be share with them.<br /><br />  Real people struggling to make a real living, real people with quirks and imperfections, real people who do not look as classically beautiful--but dressed unfashionably and \\"quirky\\" as the costume designer for the film wishes--who are really beset with making a real living-are belittled, persecuted, or given the drastic surgery by crime or abuse that Amelie seems to carry out.  No one who has known the Paris neighborhood Amelie lives in can figure out how she can live in such an apartment, in such a building, on a waitress's tips.<br /><br />  The film seems romantic, but it really exports romance outside of real life. The character seems sympathetic, only because she has no real life; none of the real desires needs, ambitions and wants that real people have.  Her actions as some beneficent match maker and changer of trouble people's life in the real world would be better replaced with an ability to learn about the pain that people who have had more life and reality have.<br /><br />  She finds her father's letters of passion for his mother while he was away in the army.  Instead of cutting them up and using them to falsify that a philanderer didn't desert her concierge, she should have revisited her view of her mother and late father whom she has remembered as cold and cruel as once being a woman of passion and a man filled with poetry and fire of love. Shouldn't she want to talk to her father about this, treat him differently, respect him as she has not to this point. Indeed who in the world does Amelie respect?<br /><br />  See this movie as a low level fantasy for childish thoughts, rather than the deep arty romantic movie it attempts to be.  Instead, it is someone's fantasy that sees love as alienated for real life.  That is sadness.gner for the film wishes--who are really beset with making a real living-are belittled, persecuted, or given the drastic surgery by crime or abuse that Amelie seems to carry out.

6305508550|5.0|Office Space is a very funny, on the mark movie about working in cubicles, having a dead end job and brain dead bosses.  One of those movies I can watch over and over and it gets funnier each time.  Our poor hero has a mind numbing job, answers to 5 bosses and is asked to take on extra work as they proceed to lay poeple off.<br />Favourite scene has to be the beating death of the despised fax machine, anyone who has worked in an office can totally relate and probably do as I do and play that scene over and over as some sort of catharsis.<br />Highly recommend this movie
B00065JTBA|5.0|Bon Jovi has endured the test of time from the hair metal, to grunge, to modern times. I have always appreciated the cheesy lyrics and great guitar solos. On this box set, is all that and more. <br />The most surprising songs on this collection are Tico Torres and David singing. When Tico sings \\"Only In My Dreams\\", his bluesy voice just moves you. When David sings \\"Memphis\\", you feel the song and his passion. If they make solo albums, I'm buying them. <br />You cannot go wrong with this set. Even at full price, its worth every penny.
B00003CXA3|5.0|Starting the gritty cop dramas to follow, THE FRENCH CONNECTION can only be describes in one word: Gritty. Before all the glamour that is the Hollywood blockbuster there was THE FRENCH CONNECTION. With no CGI or huge explosions how was this film ever great? during this review I'll tell you why THE FRENCH CONNECTION won 5 Academy Awards icluding Best Picture. <br /> <br />For the starters the film is fast. It holds nothing back with it's quick chases and startling uncovering of the facts the movie is rlentless. It moves along at apace rarely seen anymore. The movie is only about an hour and 40 minutes. Before the story has started it's already done and you're left to figure it out. To have the audience believe that this is really happening the performance of Gene Hackman is truly top- notch. He's not a real complicated character and in the script he's written pretty straight forward but Hackman puts a twist, a lonely side to \\"Popeye\\" (his nickname in the movie that is typically looked over in the film's first viewing while most are just waiting for the famous car chase. The movie shows modern day problems that people have with the law including racism and Hackman's character chases down and beats a black guy for some intel. The movies shows that cops were just as crooked then to get what they wanted people just din't care. Popeye is an old fashioned cop who does what he has to, to get what he needs no matter the level of damage he creates in getting there. <br /> <br />I read Roger Eberts review to see what he thought of the film and he says the story hardly matters in the film. I have a hard time taking a side in this debate. The movie' plot is sort of irrelevent in a way. The movie really needs no specific story for what it's trying to say. THE FRENCH CONNECTION is in no way light on story, it just takes a back seat to the unfolding of an unknown mystery of the characters and how far they will take or can take of dead ends and stakeouts. <br /> <br />Director William Friedkin (THE EXORCIST) gives the film a fast pace with close ups and chases spread across the scenery of twisting New York. He keeps a certain pace of uncertainty of the line between good and bad just likes 2001' TRAINING DAY. Friedkin's job is not underrated because he won the Oscar but is truly unappreciated. <br /> <br />THE FRENCH CONNECTION is unlike any other cop film ever! It never slows down not even to let you realize how many connections it truly has to modern day motifs of fear, uncertainty, and chaos just like it's main character.
B00005PJ8O|4.0|PATTON is really two films. An epic war masterpiece by director Franlin J. Schaffner and an intense character study of one of America's best and most mysteriuos generlas. Upon it's time of release in 1970 PATTON was the most intense war film to date and im my opinion the best. It's huge and for the most part historically accurate. Winner of 8 Academy Awards icluding Best Picture, Best Director, Best original screenplay, and Best Actor (Scott)PATTON still resonates 35 years later. <br /> <br />Pressed against the odds and facing the Nazi ank general Rommel Patton was the right man for the job. Just the right amount of insanity and genius he helped win the war. He was a very competitive man competing for different assignments and making himself very unlikeable. He believed in reincarnation and destiny. This is not a war film from the point of the soldier like so many made today. It's from the high chain of command. Patton speks waht is on his mind not caring what others think that eventually led to his downfall. The film opens with Patton speaking about war and what he feels that war is. It resonates to the times now in which Patton may have been more socially acceptable now. He says that war is not about dying for your country is about making the other bastard die for his. This happens to be one of the most effective openings in film history, painting the character right before our eyes as almost to say here he is feel free to judge because he won't care. This allows the viewer to think that they know him but Patton crushes through the movie layng out as many surprises as possible. <br /> <br />Directed under the keen eye of Franklin Schaffner Patton is one of the few war films to show scope. To show the vastness and the lonliness of war instead of the claustrophobic feeling that most films portray now. Wide shots of the African dsesrt and viwing battles not from first person, gives the audience a feeling of a foreign land. Scotts perfromance was well deserving of anOscar. <br /> <br />Despite all the wonderful things about PATTON it still cannot rival a film like APOCALYPSE NOW, THE DEER HUNTER, PLATOON,or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN that raise more important questions of morality and believing what you want to belive despite not having a choice gives other war films morw meaning to the average person. However, PATTON will remain one of the most stunning character pieces ever assembled.
B00003CXB7|4.0|As the 1970's took off and Vietnam was well underway struggling Tv director Robert Altman put together one of the finest films of the decade. contrary to popular belief MASH takes place during the Korean war at an army hospital. Although the film doesn't always take itself seriously the themes of the film do. <br /> <br />The film is basically an anti-war film. the characters seem as though they have to be there and are never at any time letting the war go to their head. It displays the rebelliuos spirit of the 70's and might be the most well acted comedy of all time. Looked over on Oscar night in favor of PATTON, MASH is a superior film. It shows the bond of friendship and despite being a heilocopter ride form the front lines the team is never at on edge and anyone to seriuos is gone.  <br /> <br />The question still to me: Is MASH a comedy or a dromedy. I feel the film and what it stands for but I've made up my mind that MASH is a comedy. A film that sugarcoats it's underlying message that war can never truly be ignored.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I know absoultely nothing about Celtic music.  I just happened to see PBS one night and I was captivated by the beautiful voices.  I watched the Celtic Woman show (twice) and decided to buy the CD through Amazon.com (not through PBS for $150).  It is soothing, angelic music...a must have!  These women are incredible.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Not much new can be said in praise of this superb film. I'm always struck by the beauty of  Jeff Gibbs' score. The successful use of other music, including Jarvo's 'Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten' and most of the pop elements, is indebted to the deeply felt original score Gibbs has created. Synth effects, maybe, but the pieces are beautifully conceived, if not entirely without precedent. The brutal effect of the film depends so tenderly on the musical score, one is reminded of Britten's high valuation of the usefulness of music. Moore's vision is commendable, and beholden in turn to the musical tableaux of Jeff Gibbs. The soundtrack CD is fine, but needs the film as much as the film cries out for Gibbs' music.  Highest recommendation for both film and musical score, both Moore and his composer. [2007 update: It's unfortunate, isnt it, how the conservative/fascist think tanks that blight the American social-political landscape actually hire people to scour [...], among other sites, in order to vote 'negative' on reviews that repudiate their vicious political agenda? This is a well documented fact. The 'votes' against this review are one example - negative 'votes' for what is really a non-political review of a film, a review focused almost entirely on the film's musical score! One can find this tactic throughout the amazon site. No matter. This is a great film that exposes Bush for the fraud he is, something the American public finally realized in 2006. Still, these cheap and honorless tactics are like food and drink to these people. What a comment on American life in our time. I gladly wear 22 'negative' votes like a badge of honor.  ~J. Anderson]
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Robert S. McNamara was undoubtedly a very prominent figure during the Cold War, as he served under Kennedy and Johnson as Secretary of Defense. He was also a controversial figure and a lightning rod for his critics because of his involvement in the Vietnam War. <br /> <br />This documentary was definitely one of the best I have ever seen. You would think that this might be a boring movie since the central character is an octogenarian man who looks like he might be a bit on the senile side. However, McNamara is a lively and interesting man who keeps you engaged in the interviews. <br /> <br />The format of this movie is engaging because it draws upon excellent historical footage and uses excellent editing in the interviews with McNamara. The movie is divided into lessons, which are often very intriguing. You'll also learn about McNamara's rapid rise from going to college to being president of the Ford company to becoming the secretary of Defense under Kennedy. You'll learn about the struggles he went through and the very difficult choices he had to make. This movie sheds light on the reasons for the failures of the United States during the Vietnam War and how the protests were difficult on McNamara's family life.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is definitely a documentary worth watching. If you are interested in American history and the Cold War, or if you just want to learn some more about the precarious situation during the Vietnam War, this film is for you.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is my third favorite Pink Floyd album behind Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. Sheep is the highlight, but the album is well balanced and complete, a true concept album.
B000002UE9|5.0|I really love Poison! The guitar riffs are great, listen to \\"Fallen Angel\\" to notice this better. \\"Every Rose Has It's Thorn\\" is a great 80's song, if you listen to any classic rock station, they'll likely be playing it often. \\"Fallen Angel\\" is my favorite though, I LOVE THE GUITAR PLAYING IN IT!!! Check this out. Oh, I notice that someone... *cough* untalented Hilary Duff *cough* copying the Open Up And Say Ahh cover. That is rude; expect a one-star!!!
B000002J29|5.0|I like this lineup of musicians, but was disappointed that Bill Bruford only appeared on one song, Cinema Show, which is an excellent version of the song. The song selection is very good, with seven songs from the Peter Gabriel era, including the epic Supper's Ready, mixed in with half of the songs from A Trick of the Tail, the album the band was touring to support when this was recorded. Phil Collins vocals sound amazingly like Peter Gabriel, and his masterful drumming is unmistakeable when he joins in during a break in the vocals. This is Phil Collins era Genesis at its peak.
B000001FKY|5.0|I love Def Leppard! This was their most successful and best CDs to date! \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" is an ultimate classic, and one of the best songs of the 80's! If you like this, you should also check out Poison's \\"Open Up And Say...AAH\\", that was another classic and great 80's album.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan Stevens has put out some great cd's, Illinoise being one of them, and is even better live. This cd of over 20 songs is creative and a great listen. I would suggest buying this cd as well as any other cd Sufjan puts out!
B0000524E5|3.0|The motion picture \\"Coyote Ugly\\" is a story that takes place in the world famous \\"Coyote Ugly\\" saloon in New York City.   The \\"Coyote Ugly\\" saloon rose to fame in the 1990s.   The saloon was the brainchild of Liliana \\"Lil\\" Lovell.   The thing that distinguishes this saloon from many others is that \\"Coyote Ugly\\" features female bartenders dancing on the bar that often will challenge customers to drinking contests while performing outrageous antics.  \\"Coyote Ugly\\" first rose to fame in 1997 when \\"Gentlemen's Quarterly\\" magazine published the experiences as told by a former \\"Coyote Ugly\\" barmaid named Elizabeth Gilbert.   The publicity of this article along with the success of the New York bar would soon lead to the movie \\"Coyote Ugly\\".    This movie basically is a movie that is set in a Hollywood version of the bar.  While this movie will entertain the audience, it can't seem to overcome a weak storyline. <br /> <br />One thing that I was immediately disappointed with is that \\"Coyote Ugly\\" isn't the story on how Lovell formed the \\"Coyote Ugly\\" saloon (which I think could have been the basis for an interesting story).   Instead, producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson along with writer Gina Wenkos tell the story of an shy aspiring songwriter Violet Sanford (played by Piper Perabo) from South Amboy, New Jersey who leaves behind her father (played by John Goodman, who delivers one of his best performances) and a job at a local Pizza Parlor to pursue a songwriting career in New York City.  When Violet arrives in New York, she realizes that breaking into the music business isn't all that it is cracked up to be.    Desperate for work, Violet hears about an opening at the \\"Coyote Ugly\\" bar.    Violet goes to meet Lil Lovell (played by Maria Bello) who sees something in Violet and decides to give her an audition.   After some rough goes, Lil eventually hires Violet on a regular basis.   The shy Violet will at first be uncomfortable with the aggressive nature of the bar, but will soon grow into the role while keeping it a secret from her father   At the same time, Violet develops a relationship with Kevin O'Donnell (played by Adam Garcia) who convinces Violet to overcome her remaining shyness and sing her songs herself.     Eventually, her job at Coyote Ugly, her quest to try to sing her songs, the relationship with Kevin, and her relationship with her father will all reach a head. <br /> <br />One of the main reasons why Coyote Ugly will entertain is because of the dancing and the soundtrack.   The dance scenes in the bar are spectacular.   Although the bar scenes are exaggerated from what actually goes on in the saloon. they are going to entertain you.   Director David McNally does a sensational job at putting integrating music throughout the movie - whether it is a bar scene or not.  While this film did spawn two soundtrack albums (\\"Coyote Ugly\\" and \\"More Music from Coyote Ugly\\"), it is worth noting that there are a few songs in the movie not found on the soundtracks (most notably, Def Leppard's \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\").   The music and dancing come together perfectly when the Coyote Dancers perform The Charlie Daniels Band's \\"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\\". <br /> <br />The movie has two noteworthy performances.  John Goodman is the perfect person to play Bill Sanford - Violet's father.  He brings the perfect balance of humor and sensitivity that is needed for the role.  While I am not a Goodman fan, I really enjoyed his performance.    The other standout performance is delivered by rising star Bridget Moynahan who plays the Rachel - a dancer with attitude who will give Violet a hard time at working at the bar.   Playing this kind of a role was something new to Moynahan and she pulls it off flawlessly. <br /> <br />Unfortunately the story just isn't that strong to support the music or the performances of Goodman and Moynahan.   The weak storyline is seen throughout the movie, but probably is best illustrated in the scenes whereViolet first goes to work at the bar.   To me, the story doesn't do a good job at convincing me how Lil Lovell sees something in the shy Violet Sanford that she hires her for an audition and then give her several chances to secure a job at the bar.  I didn't like the way that Violet overcame her early struggles in working at the bar - it seemed too scripted to me.   In general, the \\"Coyote Ugly\\" bar serves as a backdrop for the story of the movie - but I would have preferred the movie to revolve more around the bar and the Coyote dancers that worked there.   Namely, they could have done so much more to develop the character of Rachel as well as a lesser-extent Lil and another dancer named Cammie.   <br /> <br />Perhaps one of the big letdowns of the movie is Adam Garcia.  Garcia is famous for his outstanding portrayal of Tony Manero in the London stage version of \\"Saturday Night Fever\\".   Garcia is someone who has shown real talent.   Although Garcia doesn't do a bad job in the movie, the film doesn't do a good job at utilizing his talents (for example there is only one big dance scene with Garcia).   I would have liked to see Garcia have more interactions with some of the other characters - for example, interactions with Violet's overprotective father would have been very interesting. <br /> <br />It is worth noting that Supermodel Tyra Banks and singer Leann Rimes have cameo roles in this movie. <br /> <br />Overall the movie will entertain - especially from a musical standpoint and a comedic standpoint.    The ending is actually pretty good as well.   However, the shortcomings of the storyline are going to be too much to overcome.   You may be a bit disappointed if you have been to the \\"Coyote Ugly\\" saloon.   This might not be a movie you watch over and over, but it is still worth checking out.
B00006879E|4.0|I think \\"Songs About Jane\\" is a good album, the only thing that really sucks is how radio overplayed this thing... that is why I can't listen to songs like \\"Harder to Breath\\" or \\"She Will Be Loved\\" without slightly getting annoyed. Regardless, I think the music on this album is great. It is R & B and funk with a rock twist. My favorite cut on this album is \\"Sunday Morning\\", I think that is a beautiful song that can put a smile on your face. Maybe once this thing stops playing on radio 24/7 it will be easier to listen to...
B0007OCG56|4.0|I'm a huge Adam Sandler fan so much I could quote every line from Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and The Waterboy for much of the late 90's. Going into the new millennium, Sandler seem to not be able to decide whether to stick with his sophomoric shtick as with Little Nicky or move into a more sophisticated style as he did in Punch Drunk Love. And of course there is always romantic comedy with Drew Barrymore. His latest trek into the sophisticated realm was Spanglish. <br /> <br />The backdrop of the film is an essay a student has written for her application to Yale. It explains why her mother is the person she most admires and goes on to explain how her mom took her from Mexico and made her the person she was today. The problem with this is that the movie then doesn't revolve around the young girl yet focuses on the family he mother began to work for upon arriving in America. In fact the girl gets very little screen time in the movie. The family includes Sandler as the dad with an inferiority complex at being the best chef in the country, his wife, played by Ta Leoni, a victim of downsizing who can quite adapt to being a stay at home mom. They have two children, a son who barely makes blip on screen and an overweight daughter played by an actress who tries to pull off the \\"wise beyond her age\\" act but isn't able to do so. Alcoholic grandma also lives with them played perfectly by Cloris Leachman who delivers the best line in the movie, \\"Honey, lately, your low self-esteem is just good common sense.\\" That line has entered into my repertoire of insults and can't wait until I find the perfect time to unleash it. <br /> <br />The movie finally hit its stride when the family movies to a beach house for the summer when Sandler's family is introduced to the Mexican girl who is forced to move in with them due to distance reasons. Leoni finds in her the daughter she always wanted which causes problem with basically everyone else in the film. <br /> <br />The film is well written finding a balance in-between drama and comedy and also features what was one of the most disturbing sex scenes I have seen in a while. If that ever happen to me, I may have to give up sex for a while. As for the negatives, the movie seems to forget that is it based on an essay and there are many things that I doubt the girl ever knew yet she is able to write about it. Also all the driving scenes it is very obvious that green screens were used and they looked as bad as a SNL skit. A big budget movie should avoid such pitfalls. On the DVD, don't forget to check out the deleted scenes to see one of the funniest scenes with Leoni's character preparing for a party. Although the other scenes make you understand why they left out.
B000002UDG|4.0|Okay, so I go for technicalities, and the name \\"All the Best\\" is a little misleading. I argue that most of his \\"best\\" came out when he was a member of the fab four, but I understand that this album is McCartney post the fab four, so I will rate it as such. I like Sir Paul and hold him in high regard in music greatness, but at times this guy makes candy even look not sweet his music is that schmaltzy and fluffy. I can't stand cuts like \\"Silly Love Songs\\" and some of the other lovey dovey crap he has put out post Beatles. It makes me sick to my stomach how cutsey some of these songs are. However, there are some really great songs that Paul obviously has released. \\"Band on the Run\\" shows Paul tingling with progressive rock, \\"Jet\\" shows Paul can be a straight ahead rock and roller, \\"Live and Let Die\\" remains my favorite Bond theme song, and \\"Say Say Say\\" was a killer duet with then best friend Michael Jackson, much better than the insufferable \\"The Girl Is Mine\\" that they also did together. There is one missing song that really made me angry: \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", in my opinion the strongest song he cut post-Beatles, is missing??? HOW??? For that, the album drops a full star. I also take off half a star for some of the excessively sweet material he put out during this time, making this a 3.5, rounds up to a four. McCartney is a music legend, no doubt, but just like his fellow bandmates, solo success just wasn't as big as their band's success, not even close.
B00003CXAT|5.0|This is one of my favorites. It's not too deep, but yet, it's interesting to watch and the special effects are ever so realistic.
0380002930|5.0|This is an amazing book. It was a book my mother suggested to me. At first I didn't want to read it but she ended up making me read it. After the first few chapters I couldn't help but get stuck to it. After I got into the feeling of it I read it in a matter of days. This is something that everybody should read at least some time in their life. This looks like a kids book at first glance, but it is truly something you can never get too old for, I believe.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Two listens in, I was a tiny bit unimpressed because I felt like Mr. Stevens sometimes uses the same ditties over and over again. But wait, not unlike a great Pixies album, it takes a few listens and a great sense of adventure, and the album just glows. Sufjan is a great songwriter, and this album is a wonderful, fun, excellent thing
B00006RCNW|5.0|I am almost angry with myself that I waited this long to \\"get into\\" this amazing series called \\"The Shield\\". <br /> <br />Yes, I was aware how Michael Chiklis won the Globe, the Emmy, the freaking Nobel Prize, etc. Critics drooled over themselves in a manner not seen since the debut of \\"The Sopranos\\". <br />I just wasn't ready for another cop show. I loved \\"NYPD Blue\\". That was enough for me. <br /> <br />Then I got horrifically addicted to FX's  \\"Nip/Tuck\\", and now can't wait for Tuesdays and \\"Rescue Me.\\" And then \\"NYPD\\" ended. <br />I suddenly had the urge to give \\"The Shield\\", FX's flagship show, a try. <br /> <br />What an idiot I was. This series is nothing short of amazing. <br />There is nothing wrong with this show. Nothing.  <br />Name one other show you can say that about. <br /> <br />The concept: to show the inner workings of a beleaguered police station, inhabiting an old church, in the middle of the worst section of L.A. They take an unflinching, thinly veiled look at the corruption (and decency) that led to the Rampart scandal, how race riots, drug wars, and political racketeering are part of the urban landscape... you will sit goggle-eyed staring at the TV at the brazen approach to some of these topics.  <br /> <br />This show is refreshingly lacking in political correctness. <br /> <br />The idea is to present various points of perspective, good, bad, black, white, gray...and allow the viewer to arrive at their own moral conclusion. <br /> <br />And my morals have never been so challenged by any sort of media than they have by this show. You will grapple with feelings you didn't realize you had. Your own ideas about race, drugs, crimes, the police, city politics will be prodded, pricked and scrambled like an egg. This happens because you are so drawn to the characters, you will find yourself wondering what you yourself would do in these tense situations. And you will do this without realizing what you are doing. Every brain cell will be involved andattentive. <br /> <br />The thirteen episodes unfold like a carefully constructed puzzle. There are dramatic peaks within a show, as well as across 3-4 shows like mini-arcs, and in the end, all the threads come together in the altogether satisfying finale.  <br /> <br />The screenwriting is whip-crack smart...the dialogue is about the best on TV. The plot twists and turns are impossible to predict, yet as logical as a mathematic theorem. In other words, after seeing the entire season, there is not one false step. Not one unfair misdirection. Yet I was so absorbed...it was like riding a terrific rollercoaster, and you KNOW there's a drop or a loop or a curve up ahead, but you STILL are thrilled to the core. <br /> <br />The look of the show takes the handheld technique pioneered by \\"NYPD Blue\\", and elevates it to a whole new level. It's beyond the \\"docudrama\\" level, to the point where you feel like you are \\"on scene\\", peeking over people's shoulders... <br /> <br />The acting is justly celebrated. Top to bottom, these actors have been perfectly cast, beginning with Mr. Chiklis. I was only peripherally aware of him before, but during the pilot episode, he vaulted into my personal pantheon of great television actors. He makes an impression within milliseconds. After seeing the season, it will be not be a surprise to you anymore that he won the Emmy. In fact, it will seem like it could not have been anyone else. <br /> <br />Next up on the \\"ridiculously good\\" list is CCH Pounder, so often seen on network TV, yet so often unappreciated. THAT will never happen again, as her every line, look, head move and scene entrance in this show is performed to perfection.  <br /> <br />Walton Goggins, as Chiklis' loco 2nd-in-command, is a bug-eyed manic marvel. This guy's clearly defective, but you can't take your eyes off him for a minute. <br /> <br />Catherine Dent, as the female cop with secret issues and desires; Michael Jake, as the rookie black cop with religious conflicts; Jay Karnes as the flawed Boy Scout detective; Benito Martinez, as the Latino Captain with skeletons and political aspirations...they are all masterful. If they were this good before, where have they been all this time? <br /> <br />Every episode has merit...in fact, on this DVD, every episode gets a commentary, and the funny thing is they DESERVE them. But I must single out the pilot. <br /> <br />After seeing it, I knew instantly that I was hooked, and hooked for the long term. I knew I was in the presence of greatness, and I literally could not wait for the next episode. For me, this had only happened twice before: the aforementioned \\"Nip/Tuck\\" and \\"24\\". After the final shot, I yelled at my TV screen, apoplectic, \\"Holy s@#t!\\"  <br /> <br />It was awesome, let me tell you. <br /> <br />This is up there with \\"Firefly\\", \\"Buffy\\", \\"Hill Street Blues\\", \\"Sopranos\\"...it's just great television. <br /> <br />This is the reason TV is available on DVD.
B00000DCHE|4.0|Live albums are not often held in high regard in an artists discography. Although there are many exceptions to that rule, many listeners simply turn their noses up at live recordings. It's too bad, because this live album lives up to the quality of most of his studio albums. This album was executed perfectly. Joel just came off of a string of 3 multi-platinum selling albums before deciding to record his first live album, \\"Songs in the Attic\\". Joel, being the smart showman that he is, wisely decided to play cuts from his first 4 albums (besides \\"Piano Man\\"), that were not huge hits. Aside from that, Joel also had a strong backing band to give these older songs a thicker sound, more in line with his bigger hits. Joel seized the opportunity to bring his earlier discography to life, and he succeeded brilliantly.<br /><br />The album starts off with a bang on \\"Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)\\", which clearly presents that the listener is in for a treat. Some of my favorite cuts are \\"Summer, Highland Falls\\", \\"She's Got a Way\\", and \\"I've Loved These Days\\". Like I said, many of the original versions are outshine by the new live versions, including \\"Streetlife Serenader\\", \\"Captain Jack\\", \\"The Ballad of Billy the Kid\\", and \\"Los Angelenos\\". His voice is a large part in the vast improvement. It just sounds thicker and full of life. The melodies and feel of the music is warmer than that of the studio recordings.<br /><br />Although I can't put this album above some of Joel's most seminal work, I will say that it's a lot better than his first three albums, and definitely stands as essential listening for those seeking out the beautiful crooning talents of Billy Joel.
0743246616|5.0|I am a recent convert to the Magnolia Bakery. Seeing it on Sex and the City, I took my husband on a tour of the show where we tried these magnificent cupcakes. I have made them as well as the Red Velvet Cake... both fantastic! If you want a different cook bok for cakes - that people will love - get this one!
B00000DCH9|4.0|Coming off of his muddled 1971 debut, \\"Cold Spring Harbor\\", we find Joel still searching for his signature sound. Joel spent six months as a lounge singer in his hometown on Los Angeles. During that time, he continued to write songs, including his breakthrough hit, \\"Piano Man\\". Probably most apparent for the search for finding his true sound, is the heavy lyrical and musical influence \\"Piano Man\\" borrows from Elton John's \\"Tumbleweed Connection\\" (by far my favorite work from Elton John). The album coveys Western images and bluesy gospel sentiments (similar to that of the \\"Tumbleweed Connection\\"), but makes it his own with his clear knack for soothing melodies, which is a large step up from his debut.<br /><br />Although this isn't Joel's best work, I'd have to say that there are quite a few quality standout tracks. \\"Travelin' Prayer\\", the album opener, is very enjoyable, and unique among Joel's other work. Of course, \\"Piano Man\\" is the album highlight, where we hear some of Joel's finest character sketch work, which will be more prominent in his latter efforts. The sweeping melodies of \\"The Ballad of Billy the Kid\\" ranks among my favorites. The lush epic \\"Captain Jack\\" also stands as a strong cut. Some cuts aren't as strong, such as \\"You're My Home\\", where he delves back into \\"Cold Spring Harbor\\" territory. But the high points of the record overshadow many of it's weak points.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine record. All the talent that brought us his most groundbreaking records (1976-1980), is presented here in a maturing fashion. If you have never purchased anything by Billy Joel, this isn't necessarily the place to start. I would start with \\"The Stranger\\", then work your way around to \\"Turnstiles\\" and \\"Glass Houses\\". This is far from Joel's crowning achievement, but it's an enjoyable piece of discography in Billy Joel's early years.
0375507256|4.0|An astonishing tour de force, if there's a problem with this book it is that it operates on too many levels.  But it certainly operates.  It's hard to imagine an imagination that could dream it all up.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love Joss Whedon.  I loved his Buffy and Angel series and I love this series too.  The movie (Serenity)will be out in September so get a jump on the move and get this series first.  You won't be disappointed.
0316168815|5.0|I read this book (as recommended by other reviewers) in a few<br /><br />long sittings.  It is a real tear-jerker, for powerful reasons.<br /><br />The book, as everyone knows, is about a teenaged girl who has<br /><br />been raped and murdered and watches her family fall apart and<br /><br />fall back together, while she lives in \\"heaven\\".  This description<br /><br />sounds hokey, but in my opinion Alice Sebold has done a wonderful<br /><br />job.<br /><br />Sebold is a powerful writer who draws realistic and compelling<br /><br />characters.  She also does a masterful job of portraying adolescent<br /><br />attitudes and their evolving maturity.  I particularly liked<br /><br />how she writes about the victim's sister (Lindsey) and her<br /><br />boyfriend (Samuel).<br /><br />The story is truly heartbreaking, but somehow there are occasional<br /><br />rays of light and hope that make it bearable to comprehend.<br /><br />I liked the poetic justice for the villain, though he has<br /><br />unfortunately done a lot of evil by the time he meets his fate.<br /><br />The victim's parents are presented realistically but<br /><br />sympathetically, and I liked how Sebold deftly created their<br /><br />characters and interactions so that the reader could really<br /><br />understand who they were and why they made their choices.  This<br /><br />was further evolved by the grandparents, who make various<br /><br />appearances on Earth and in heaven.<br /><br />It is true that there must be some suspension of disbelief for<br /><br />a reader to enjoy this novel.  But if you have patience for<br /><br />magic realism, and want a moving emotional experience, I highly<br /><br />recommend this book.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Highly recommended. Martin Tillman has brilliantly captured the thrill and sounds of Pirates and the high seas. If you are a Pirate at heart, there is no way that you can not love this score.
B00003CXXP|2.0|There are no recycling centers or toxic waste regulations in AI's resource-conscious future? <br /> <br />An expensive prototype child robot is abandoned by \\"mother\\" on a roadside, with no accounting to the manufacturer? And no tracking system is installed on these robots? David's designers conduct zero follow-on data collection, and aren't remotely concerned with David's welfare or whereabouts? Well maybe, since they couldn't even be bothered to program this robot to avoid consuming solid food. I'd like to have seen how \\"father\\" and \\"brother\\" reacted when David suddenly went missing. And speaking of missing, did anybody else notice that a police amphibicopter can be hijacked and flown away by anyone who just feels like climbing in -- like, whoops, they neglected to program an i.d. check or automatic power shutdown into that machine. It's strange that catastrophic global warming results in the ocean FREEZING solid...and then the advanced robots magically know to excavate through billions of tons of ice in southern Brooklyn, expending unknown gigawatts of energy to locate David (even though he has no tracking system installed). <br /> <br />I can enjoy a fantasy narrative, but here the director/writer wants it both ways: the film commences portraying the scientific method and peer review and normal cause-and-effect; but whenever these become inconvenient to Spielberg and his story, out the window they go. It degrades the viewer when logic is blatantly ignored if it is deemed inconvenient. Maybe that's the true meaning of Artificial Intelligence: the deluded minds of Hollywood liberals!
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|If you were born around the 77-80's then you'll remember this movie for sure. Nice recopilation of interviews, you will know some facts that you never imagined. Do you know who was the first option for Miyagi San?? Who trainned the actors? How do you hate John Kreese? What happened with the Kais? What happened in the Crane Kick scene?? You'll have to but this DVD my friend!!
B00005JNTX|5.0|It is now official that Robert Rodriguez will be releasing a full, 2-disc special edition copy of Sin City in early December. It will feature the film (theatrical version and a version in which the three tales can be viewed separately)and a disc of bonus features (ten minute cooking school, ten minute film school, a few commentaries, trailers, poster gallery, and a load of featurettes). <br />So if your just looking for the theatrical version and nothing more, buy the featured DVD now. If your a fan, and want all of the nooks and crannies, I think you can hold out until late November or early December, trust me, it should be worth it.

B0009P42S2|4.0|Do you love steam? I mean do you REALLY love steam? Do you love pressure gauges and release valves and gears and pipes? If so \\"Steamboy\\" is the movie for you. The movie opens in a factory where the steam pressure has increased to a dangerous level. After the inevitable explosion the movie switches to its second scene, a factory with an uncontrolled buildup of steam. This is a movie that SERIOUSLY enjoys showing the effects of steam pressure. The knock against \\"Steamboy\\" is that it's visually stunning but lacking in story. For the first half of the movie I was ready to write a review disagreeing but at the half way mark the movie seemed to lose...steam?<br /><br />\\"Steamboy\\" takes place in Victorian era England featuring steam technology that never actually existed. At this point mythological industrial era technology has practically reached the level of genre having been used in more than a few movies and books most recently in \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentleman\\" and the unfortunate \\"Wild Wild West\\". The story revolves around the near magical steam ball, a bowling ball size object that contains enough pressure to power an entire building. This is the device that young Ray Steam uses to become the titular \\"Steamboy\\" although he doesn't don his flight suit and steam rocket until an hour and a half into the movie and even then only takes a few short flights. The last half hour of the movie seems to be an homage to steam pressure with expanding and exploding pipes and endless scenes of destruction and then the movie quickly ends.<br /><br />The plot seems a bit threadbare which is a shame after the loving devotion spent on animation. Director Katsuhiro Ôtomo seemed to be trying to make some kind of point about the place of science at the dawn of the industrial age but I wasn't sure what the point was. On one hand the Steam Castle was a technologic (if unfeasible) wonder but on the other hand the technology was used to create weapons which nearly destroy London. In the end the Steam Castle seemed to exist merely to demonstrate how much steel and glass could be lifted off the ground using steam.<br /><br />\\"Steamboy\\" has more than its fair share of powerful imagery including the re-introduction of Ray's father Eddie who, thanks to an explosion, seems to be practically steam powered himself. The movie is a step above the usual Japanese Anime but Ôtomo still falls well short of the storytelling skills of a master like Hayao Miyazaki.he end the Steam Castle seemed to exist merely to demonstrate how much steel and glass could be lifted off the ground using steam.<br /><br />\\"Steamboy\\" has more than its fair share of powerful imagery including the re-introduction of Ray's father Eddie who, thanks to an explosion, seems to be practically steam powered himself.

B0009NCQJ6|4.0|I always enjoy listening to this lovely quartet's music. <br />So having not only the CD but the DVD on one disc makes it easy  <br />to take along when traveling. And who wouldn't want to be with <br />them?
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|If you're looking for a movie true to Homer's work, this isn't quite it.  All they say is it was \\"inspired by\\" anyway, never claimed to be a screen version of the Illiad. <br /> <br />If however, you're just looking to be entertained by a well acted, beautifully shot epic movie, I thought this was very good.  I watch movies while I work out and judge them on how well they hold my interest and make the workout go quickly.  This was a 5-star on that.   <br /> <br />Acting was great.  Several memorable lines in a generally good script.  Acting was convincing.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend it if you like the genre. <br /> <br />

B0002Z9HT8|5.0|For those off you who either were there or watched on TV as the day went on and group after group offered their time and talent to a worthy cause,............this set provides performances that will never be seen again. Outstanding to see, for those of us who taped the event on our VCR's back then, how clear the picture and the sound were. I would recommend this set to those of you with kids that watched the Live 8 concert so they may have an appreciation for the musicianship and showmanship of the entertainers of the time.
B00004XPPK|4.0|This review is for the 2000 Columbia DVD release.    The story opens on the waterfront of Buenes Aires during World War II where a cheating street gambler named Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) is rescued from an armed robbery by a more refined gentleman named Ballin Mundson (George Macready).  Mundson invites Farrell to his posh casino and Farrell shows up and uses slight of hand to go on huge winning streak at the blackjack table.  In spite of Farrell's untrustworthiness, Mundson hires Farrell to be his right hand man for overseeing the casino operations.  Not too long after that, Mundson goes out of town and returns with a beautiful wife named Gilda (Rita Hayworth).  When Mundson introduces Farrell to Gilda, there is instant tension and discomfort between the two.  Its obvious they have noticable distain for each other.  This opens up a long and loathsome relationship between all three of these characters.    The saving grace of the movie is Rita Hayworth.  She lights up the screen with beauty and style and can even sing and dance.  Her first scene in the movie is one of the best glamour shots in the history of filmmaking.  She radiates with charm and grace in that famous scene.  But in this film, she plays a character where her beauty is just a thin veneer for an extraordinary amount of distain and she constantly undermines the other two men.      The plot of this movie is not easy to follow.  There is clearly a hidden past between Gilda and Johnny, but only a few vague personal remarks seem to be the only clues of their prior history.  There is also another subplot between Mundson and a group of men with a powerful and subversive business plan.  That plot too is underdeveloped.  All in all, it's a very ambiguous story of people with a beautiful facade, but rotten to the core.  It seemed more of a visual exercise than a mental one.    As for the DVD, the movie was restored, but not meticuously.  There is still a lot of tiny specs of film loss throughout most of the movie, but the picture quality is still very sharp.  The sound is excellent.   There are also a handful of brief but informative bonus features.      Movie: B-    DVD Quality: B
B00005JKC3|4.0|This movie is about anger, violence and their consequences. Ang Lee has chosen to make a comic book movie adaptation with a conscience. It's too bad it was marketed to the most puerile audience. They have little chance of getting it.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This is a great album for someone who is a collector or doesn't have the rest of their albums. Guns n' Roses Live Era '87-'93 already has all these songs. Also I read Fred Dursts Numba One Fann opinion, and I should say that first of all, he should find out what band this review is on and then make an opinion. He mentioned all these songs that he said were missing in this album, and the songs he mentioned are by another great band, Poison not G n' R. So please check before talking!
038533348X|4.0|Like most of Vonnegut's works, \\"Cat's Cradle\\" proves incredibly hard to explain or review. To sum up, if you like books that make you think, keep you on your toes and off balance, and challenge your assumptions about the way things are or should be, you'll like \\"Cat's Cradle.\\" <br /> <br />In this book, Vonnegut explores some familiar themes like the interconnectedness of peoples' lives and how, even from distances of time and space, unexpected and seemingly trivial interactions between people can have huge consequences.  Vonnegut makes it clear to us all that sometimes matters of huge importance hang on tragically small details.   <br /> <br />So if you like a book that will challenge you and make you pleasantly uncomfortable (whatever that means), give this one a read.  It won't take you long and you'll have experienced the world from an entirely different perspective - not a bad bargain.
B000002C25|5.0|I have never understood how an album so good has been identified with being so mediocre.  The only guess that I can surmise is the fact that Oasis: Be Here Now is a very indulgent record ( a lot of long tracks with overdrawn choruses that have a lyrical swagger bordering on the obnoxious).  For some bizarre reason, maybe because of the fact that they themselves are elitists, music reviewers tend to wince at anything that seems pompous or overindulgent.  Don't believe it! <br />     Be Here Now, the last truly great Oasis album, is a masterpiece.  It seems that over time more and more people are discovering this fact.  I actually believe it to be the finest Oasis album, ever so marginally better than What's the Story, Definitely Maybe, and The Masterplan (which, of course was B-sides).  It has amazing, driving guitar tracks (My Big Mouth, I Hope, I Think, I Know) and poignant hook-laden ballads (Stand By Me, Magic Pie) throughout the affair.  This was the final Oasis album with Guigsy and Bonehead, and the loss of them, however debatable, seems to have made a significant impact on their following releases.  This is an outstanding album, and should be considered no other way.
0767834739|3.0|This movie had better actions scenes and a more interesting plot. There were more emotions in the actors. I felt that one of the actresses, whom ever played Jill, wasn't up to par. The ending of the movie was another cliff hanger just like the first one. It leaves you wanting more.

B00005JNBQ|2.0|This movie really should have just been one of those short movies you see at film fests which are twenty to thirty minutes long.  There were a few funny lines here and there and I even chuckle when I think back on some of them (i.e. Kid on Bus-Napolean what are you gonna do today; Napolean- Whatever I feel like I wanna do. Gosh!).  However, after forty-five minutes or so the movie just seemed to drag.  Like others that have written reviews, I profess to liking offbeat, otherwise dull character driven movies.  Nevertheless, I watched the last part of the movie while unloading the dryer.  Note-If you too do this make sure not to miss the final dance scene.  That is worth checking out.
B000AP04FG|1.0|I can't believe the reviews I'm reading about this movie, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Boring plot, ridiculous action and corny dialogue! I fell asleep watching this and wanted my money back for sitting through this crap, I think the only reason people watch this is because of the star power that was involved and the whole break up and Brad and Jen, This movie was ridiculous! Common on people back me up.
B00007ELEL|4.0|One of my favorite movies ever, The Big Lebowski is a masterpiece.  The parts are perfectly cast and the music gives the exact mood to every scene. <br />It took me a long time to finally buy it on DVD and to be honest, it doesn't have as many extras as I would like to (it loses a star because of that)
B00006AW2P|5.0|Another response to the reviewer bashing the SACD Hybrid releases. First, no one is making you buy an SACD player. Relax. Second, considering it IS an SACD, the price is actually a bargain. So, again, relax. Third, yes, the sound quality of SACDs IS that much better. Refrain from making judgment on something until you have experienced it. And fourth, as the other commentator diligently noted, these are HYBRID CDs. They will play on your Hello Kitty CD player and sound oh so sweet. Please, pull the cotton out of your ears and your thumb from your nose. <br /> <br />And by the way, the music rocks.
B00003OSSL|4.0|For those of you out there that have completely destroyed this film with your words, I suggest revisiting Random Hearts post-9/11.  While I hate to use that dreadful moment in our history as a staple for this review, one cannot help but consider the connections and possibilities between the fictitious story of this film and those unthinkable WTC events.  Director Sydney Pollack has done a fabulous job of adapting a story that is both suspenseful, creative, and full of human emotion.  He did a superb job of casting both Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott-Thomas who engulf these sinister characters and bring that much-needed emotion to the screen.  His music seems cheesy at times, yet draws you into some scenes the next.  With all of these great elements coming together for Random Hearts, why is it that so many people have rated this film low?  My response to that has to do with seeing this film in a completely different light.  There were elements that I thought were brilliant, yet needed to have some thought involved.  Harrison Ford was one of these elements, as well as Pollack's use of airports throughout the film.  Let me explain.<br /><br />I saw Harrison Ford as this very evil character in this film.  Perhaps this was not the tone that Pollack was hoping to create with Random Hearts, but it was what I witnessed when I watched it.  When you watch it, see if you see it as well.  Throughout the film Ford pushes Thomas into what he wants.  He invades her life, rummages through her personal moments, and even seduces her to discover more information.  He is the one most hurt by this disaster, and it turns him dark.  While most will argue that the event brought these two hearts together, I think Ford's character was weaker than we imagined.  He needed that comfort level that his wife provided and found it with Thomas.  He wasn't going to stop until he was with her and found out everything he could about his cheating wife.  Ford was creepy to me in this film.  While I think Kristin Scott-Thomas did an outstanding job countering this insanity that Ford brought with him, it was really Ford that captured the aura of the film.  Thomas was like a child being lead throughout the mall by her determined father.  Broken, hurt, destroyed, and even paranoid were all elements that were creeping into Ford's life, and he had no clue how to handle them, so he attached himself to Thomas ... perhaps more than he should have.<br /><br />Take Ford's powerful character and Thomas' weakened version of Kay and throw in Pollack's mastermind and you honestly have an amazing film.  The scenes that really blew my mind in this film were how Pollack continually brought Ford and Thomas back into the airport.  It was because of an airport that these two random strangers met, now throughout the film, they have some of their toughest moments back in that same airport.  When they return of Miami sparks a new chapter for both of them, the scene where they both are flying, but cannot be seen together was beautifully awkward and dark, then at the end when they meet together for the climax, it felt a bit stalker-ish to me.  Ford was spooky, nearly saying that he cannot continue life without Thomas' comfort.  His final speech was supposed to be happy, but to me came across as very wimpy and boarding on lunacy.  It was amazing.<br /><br />While the background stories seem to mesh well, I honestly could have done with less of Thomas' story of trying to win an election, and pushed more of Ford's story of how the loss of his wife was destroying his career.  I thought this was a really interesting segway that should have been explored more.  I wanted to see the fall of Ford, and I think he was just about there.  I wanted to see him break down and really turn into this Hitchcockian character.  I wanted to really see him corrupt his life because his persistence on detail created this flawed marriage.  There was so much more that should have been done with Ford's character, thatI was continually biting my nails hoping that Pollack would take that Requiem for a Dream direction.  Alas, he did not, I am not sure if it was because he was trying to attract a different audience or what, but Pollack had a dark film on his hands, sadly, he just didn't push that envelope that far.<br /><br />Overall, as odd that this may sound, I was impressed with this film.  I believe this was one of those rare Hollywood instances where they had the chance to really scare us with some backwards characters, but instead changed to this high road of \\"romance\\" and \\"drama\\".  I saw this film as a very disturbing film thanks to the work of Harrison Ford.  I am not sure if this was the direction either he or Pollack saw the film going, but it is what I experienced in my viewing.  I really suggest you go back and see this film with its darker undertones.  I may be pulling this out of nowhere, but to me Ford was spooky, Thomas was this pushover that Ford manipulated, and Pollack had a masterpiece before his time.  Random Hearts was an unexpected film that I cannot wait to watch again!<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****er, that I was continually biting my nails hoping that Pollack would take that Requiem for a Dream direction.  Alas, he did not, I am not sure if it was because he was trying to attract a different audience or what, but Pollack had a dark film on his hands, sadly, he just didn't push that envelope that far. <br /> <br />Overall, as odd that this may sound, I was impressed with this film.  I believe this was one of those rare Hollywood instances where they had the chance to really scare us with some backwards characters, but instead changed to this high road of \\"romance\\" and \\"drama\\".  I saw this film as a very disturbing film thanks to the work of Harrison Ford.  I am not sure if this was the direction either he or Pollack saw the film going, but it is what I experienced in my viewing.  I really suggest you go back and see this film with its darker undertones.  I may be pulling this out of nowhere, but to me Ford was spooky, Thomas was this pushover that Ford manipulated, and Pollack had a masterpiece before his time.  Random Hearts was an unexpected film that I cannot wait to watch again! <br /> <br />Grade: **** out of *****
B00005JNSK|3.0|I won't be a spoiler...but having said that I was not happy with the ending...or how Tim Burton interpreted the ending... <br /> <br />Now that that is out of the way, Johnny Depp was, as usual, great.  His portrayal of Willie Wonka was amazing...although the haircut was left over from the Dutch Boy paint can.  And the casting of Charlie was spot on.  Although I liked the first grandpa bucket from the Gene Wilder version. <br /> <br />It was a good film, but like many films based on books, it could not fully recreate the magic of the Dahl book.  Better than the first film?...maybe, but I don't like musicals!

Also I like all kinds of genres from Pop to rock, even folk, punk, grunge, and some times techno (mainly Massive Attack), but of course I'm a all time saddo for rating this so-called masterpiece one, oh I'm even more sad for not not liking ATYCLB, or anything U2 have done in the 21st Century (not including Electrical Storm, U2's last decent song!!!!)  <br /> <br />You'll find it's people who KNOW SOMETHING about music dislike this album because it is old, washed up, and to put it plainly a sell out. Also when I listen to something 8-10 times but it sounds worse with each listen I hardly would say that I should give it more time, I mean Zeppelin are tough to grasp at first, so, are Floyd, and Dylan, but with each listen the quality comes through and the listening experience is better and better and on some occasions (like some Smiths albums) you almost bond with the album!!! It isn't you force yourself to listen to it for an eleventh time, thinking maybe it won't be bad after 12 listens, sorry butit isn't just me but over 300 people have rated this one star!!!! So I am not the only one am I!!! <br /> <br />As for the album, well Vertigo is decent, but it wares of after a couple of listens, in truth the first six are ok, but nothing special, and whilst you can barely go through that the last six are awful, and Man & Woman is possibly the worst U2 song ever, actually maybe it's Original of the Species, hell it could be any of the last six!!!! <br /> <br />There are ok tunes, the forementioned Vertigo, All because of you, and the two singles, but these are ok, nothing special, nothing to bond to, and nothing for you to say, I want to hear more of this U2, I wonder what they'll do next??? No after this you'll never want to listen to U2 again, and God forbid if you're new to U2 because if this is your introduction I feel sorry for all the things you've already missed out on!!! <br /> <br />So don't buy this, may I please (if you're new to U2, if not just click yes, if helpful, or no, if a member of U2's marketing team) advice you to spend your money of other U2 products, you see all those U2 marketing guys who vote no, don't realise I'm actually doing them a favour by introducing them to the good stuff instead of turning them away because of this!!!!! <br /> <br />Anyway, buy these instead!!! <br /> <br />War <br />The Unforgettable Fire <br />The Joshua Tree <br />Achtung Baby <br />Zooropa <br />Pop <br /> <br />You see, I've just made U2 a good fortune, and that marketing team must really hate me for including Zooropa & Pop in my list, I mean what would Bono ever say???

0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris makes assumptions that for atheists, and many agnostics, are self-evident but will slap a few unsuspecting readers right in the face. The assumptions: there most likely isn't a god and the mainstream religions of the world are highly questionable on a number of counts. I'm sure some readers will indignantly put the book down at that point, which is too bad. Others may seek evidence of these assumptions -- happily, one of Harris's main points is that our tendency to demand evidence for all claims of truth should be applied equally to religion as it should be to everything else. For people who get stuck on the points of whether there is a God or whether religions are truthful, there is a wealth of erudite sources (such as George Smith's \\"Why Atheism?\\") that you might want to consider reading as a supplement.<br /><br />Harris's point is not whether or not there's a god, or whether religions are right, he assumes the negative (probably correctly) on both these counts. His points seem to be these: (1) we demand evidence for all claims of truth, why not for religion? (2) faith - belief without evidence - can lead people to do things that hurt others, sometimes on a large scale, and this isn't good. (3) Islam, as it exists in the modern world, is potentially a very dangerous set of beliefs and Western leaders who want to be \\"tolerant\\", as well as moderate religious people, don't sufficiently challenge the erroneous thinking that stems from extremes of religion. (4) that there are plenty of ways to be experientially fulfilled without having to rely on religion or a God concept.<br /><br />Harris's main point is that we need new rules for conversation. Simply put, he says that when someone says something absurd that they believe \\"on faith\\", we ask them for proof rather than that being the end of the discussion. If people cannot support dubious ideas with logic and evidence, Harris argues that we should not take those views seriously.<br /><br />In general this is a clear, incisive, and occasionally shocking book (see what \\"moderate\\" Islamic Egyptian media says about Jews). It also makes a good attempt at reasoning around some tricky ethical territory. My two reservations were (1) what seemed to me not sufficiently skeptical treatment of \\"parapsychology\\", which came up on two occasions (as best as I recall), and (2) the inclusion of extra useful content in endnotes, perhaps this is personal preference, but footnotes make it much easier to read asides without losing one's place.<br /><br />Readers of this book who are fascinated by psychology may also enjoy \\"In the wake of 9/11 the psychology of terror\\" by Pyszczynski, Solomon, & Greenberg.nd occasionally shocking book (see what \\"moderate\\" Islamic Egyptian media says about Jews).

B000067IZ3|5.0|There's tons of reviews of this movie, so I'll just give a short impression.  I watched it again recently, thus the review.<br /><br />The war on drugs is ill thought out and will never work.  This film is art that makes that point.<br /><br />I'd say this movie should be watched and digressed by politios and pundits and really mulled over.  How many innocent lives need to be destroyed before we realize that peoples behavior cannot be changed by legislation?<br /><br />I don't know all the answers, but this movie provides some food for thought.<br /><br />Legalize it?  Maybe it's not a pancea, but, I, with my libertarian bent, seem to think it'd be a better way to deal with the problem, and I think this film, if really thought about, supports my view, at least from the aspect of the fact that the film could be totally nonfiction.<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend the movie if you haven't seen it yet, and if it's been awhile, it might be worth it again if you wondering about how we might change our drug laws to better society.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I received my DVDs in great condition and in a reasonable time frame.
B000957O82|4.0|Come to think about it, I've enjoyed most of his movies, I think that Wild West one was pretty much a total flop, but other than that, he's done pretty well in the films he's signed up for.<br /><br />Okay, I Robot was a bit slow and that other futurist flick with the guys that can find you anywhere was kind of silly, but I digress.<br /><br />I know Will Smith bugs some, but I've always enjoyed his characters and I think he's a good actor (provided he's in the right role).  I can't wait to see him star opposite Slim Shady, now that'd be a film worth waiting in line for.  But I digress, ya think those two will do a film?  Anyway, back to this one, what was I saying about it?<br /><br />Oh, the chemistry here was good, I liked the co-star, but can't recall her name at the moment, or where I've seen her before, but anyway, this is a good date film, one of those chick flick type movies that guys can enjoy as well.<br /><br />I watched it with my girlfriend, case in point, and while that means I missed a couple scenes along the way, I did enjoy the movie and give it a recommendation.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a movie you either love or hate.  Those who love it are open minded, look deep within the film, and closely observe the characters.  Those who hate it are not true film lovers. They only like to be entertained so that there simple minds can have 2 hrs of action packed, sensual, and unprofound images and characters.  \\"Lost In Translation\\" does not rely on action or really even dialogue for that matter.  The entire movie is all based on the characters themselves, their facial expressions, their behavior, etc.  One must observe the movie rather than watch it.  Keep an open mind when viewing. Do not let your mind wander.  Focus on the film, the story, the thoughts, the pictures, the characters.  If you do this, you will see the beauty behind the film and why it was nominated for 4 Academy Awards!
B000286S8S|4.0|The Best of Both Worlds is a very good compilation of the career of an awesome rock band: Van Halen. I am 17 years old, so I was not around when VH was at its best, but I've found them and for me, their music made me a rock and roll fan 100%. Here are my thoughts on the album: <br /> <br />Pros: <br />All the best VH music is represented here, much more than the \\"Best Of\\" released in 1996. The three new tracks by Sammy and the band are good (not big hits, but nice songs to satisfy the hunger for new work). I do want to say that the artwork for this 2-CD set was the perfect choice. Awesome! <br /> <br />Cons: <br />Now, there are a few things that would make this near perfect. First, I'd rather the songs be in chronological order. But, it's not the worst thing; the songs are still there. Second, I personally would not include the three live tracks on this compilation. Instead, songs such as \\"Mean Sreet\\" (Fair Warning) and \\"Little Guitars\\" (Diver Down) would fit nicely into this collection. I also feel that another song from \\"Women And Children First\\" would complete this 2-disk set. <br /> <br />Now, to touch on the stupid \\"David Lee Roth/Sammy Hagar\\" debate. Again, I wasn't around back when it happened, but here's my view. Yes, DLR and Van Halen were the perfect match. But, I also happen to like the band with Sammy. For those of you who are DLR loyalists, I have this to say: Did the band have hits with Sammy? Yes. Did the albums with Sammy as the lead man sell millions? Yes. Did \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" receive a Grammy? Yes. There's some food for thought. <br /> <br />The bottom line is this: You can't change what has happened. The band was awesome with both Dave and Sammy, and that's why this is \\"The Best Of Both Worlds.\\" <br /> <br />It is the story of a band that made it's own unique mark on rock history. It's one that I surely love, while rock today isn't that bad, this is great rock from a time when rock was bigger than it is today. <br /> <br />My personal reccomendation is to get this, and if you can, check out the complete Van Halen by taking a listen at songs from their other albums (except maybe Van Halen III, that is!)
B00092ZL80|5.0|Same selections as at the Greek here in Florida last Friday night.  I was simply stunned at the overall presentation.  Amazing!!  My only semi mild note is that Peter Cetera is sorely missed.  His replacement is a bit weak..  However, we paid a fortune for the tickets and they would have been worth twice as much!!  Ordered the DVD and hope that one comes out for Palm Beach, Florida as well!!  Thanks EWF and ORD- see ya next summer!!
B00012QM8G|5.0|I always have this image of a filmmaker who does films that may not be historically important or \\"serious\\" films and decides he's going to do one just to show that he can too do films that are not just fluff pieces. Look at Michael Bay. He tries to do films with heart but they end up becoming looking plastic or fake like Armageddon. Then he tries Pearl Harbor and despite the nice looks of Kate Beckinsale and the great job of ILM it's still shot in that kind of MTV style editing where it's too fast to see anything. So Spielberg after making a big hit with Jurassic Park made this next and it's really good, even if you can only watch it now and then. <br /> <br />Oskar Schindler started out as not the savior he ended up becoming. He was a war profiteer, womanizer and member of the Nazi party living in occupated Poland. Soon the Jews are rounded up by the Germans and put into camps, overseen by Amon Goethe. First wanting to get money, he decides to \\"hire\\" some Jews to save them from the camps. It's only after that it's ordered that Jew bodies be exhumed and burned that he sees the horror(punctuated by a very effective red colored dress amongst the black and white of its surroundings). <br /> <br />Shooting in black and white in a way makes the violence a little less so. Some of the Jews that get shot in the head actually have like a gushing of blood, kind of like a tamer version of Kill Bill 1 scenes. The violence is meant to show the horrors of it all without having to kind of get the audience on your side(I still hate that scene in the Pianist where an elderly man is thrown off a balcony). Also the black and white helps one scene where in order to hide, kids go inside toilets, floating around in the...well you know. Wouldn't look appealing in color right? <br /> <br />The blonde girl in the red dress actually existed, she wrote a memoir called The Girl in the Red Coat and was named Roma Ligocka. She lived naturally but here she's one of the many bodies sent to be burned. It's there to change Schindler from a laissez-faire attitude about the Jews to something terrible. In a way, he's one of the only sane people in the place, treating Jews like people, like hosing them down with water when they're on trains and kissing a Jewish woman(who's hot by the way, just saying). Performances are great all around, notable being Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley. <br /> <br />It's easy to understand the noticeable thin extras but you still feel slightly disappointed. You have 2 featurettes: Voices of the Past which is an hour documentary about the Jewish survivors having their recollections videotaped which is the goal of the company featured in the 2nd featurette. The Shoah Foundation videotapes and catalogues their testimonies to have a record of all that happened during the Holocaust. Well they're good in their own way, it still would've helped to have at least something on the film like the interview with Spielberg on the Close Encounters and Jaws DVD's. <br /> <br />It's not really a film where you're going to watch it repeatedly but when you do you end up enjoying it. <br /> <br />BTW: the man who puts the rose on the grave at the end is Liam Neeson. The actor is supposed to accompany the Jew they portrayed in the film so that's why he's putting the rose down. <br /> <br />
B000002C1W|4.0|...the post-Waters-Floyd I still have to admit that I prefer most of the songs from this first release by \\"Gilmours'\\" Floyd live on both \\"Delicate sound of thunder\\" and \\"Pulse\\" (this having nothing to do with the \\"show\\" of the Pink Floyd-conserts, though I am a big fan of the visual creativity that contains in their gigs also -and without doubt plays a big part of their reputation and fame today), and especially perhaps the awesome, stunning, magical, genious \\"Learning to fly\\" -probably my favorite Pink Floyd-song ever. This being said; The album includes some absolute classics like \\"Sorrow\\" and \\"On the turning away\\", and also \\"Yet another movie\\" and the superb instrumental of \\"Terminal frost\\". <br /> <br />The sound could have, no, should have (!) been better -but it does not ruin the experience of \\"A momentary lapse of reason\\", it's just that sound is playing such a big part of Pink Floyds' music -as in a big part of what they are famous for. I hear the remastered-edition of the album is much better, and this is good news. <br /> <br />It has the sound of the 80s', the previous Floyd (and also their latest \\"The division bell\\") sounds perhaps more \\"timeless\\" in a way -but you can instantly hear that this is a Pink Floyd-album, and a good one such. Musically Roger Waters isn't missed, it has (or had) a fresher sound to it -the lyrics on \\"Learning to fly\\" are great, and there is nothing embarrasing (to say it least) about the rest of lyrics on the album -and though I am a big fan of Waters, well -personally I was becoming a bit tired of his childhoods' many traumas after \\"The wall\\". And to you who complain about this being Gilmours' solo-album, what about \\"The wall\\"? What about \\"The final cut\\". Whos' solo-albums were those? Read interviews with Roger Waters who himself is saying that Pink Floyd was no longer a band at the time of those. That they hadn't been a band since \\"Wish you were here\\" when the band was falling apart. Not that I care much about that, the albumsare good. And so is this one, and better yet -perhaps Pink Floyd needed a change? Where Pink Floyd would have been today with Waters still behind the wheel is hard to say? I am a fan of his solo-albums (\\"Amused to death\\" is my favorite), but very often he sounds to still be stuck behind his wall. And Pink Floyd with the tour of \\"The division bell\\" were as big as ever, so if many Floyd-fans are stuck in the past, well, the boys have made it!
B00004RJ74|5.0|In one of my favorite films Aliens, besides one scene involving a chestburster, it's literally gore free. That is until the end when a certain artificial person gets a messy end(doesn't die but might as well be). So what happens is that one moment of gore seems more amplified because the rest of the film was completely free of it. So it is too with this film, it starts out with some violence but nothing too over the top and then boom, gore galore. <br /> <br />Seth and Richard Gecko are wanted by many a government officer and need to get into Mexico, only Mexico's border crossing has more cops than before. So they kidnap a small family and break through and end up where they need to:  a seedy biker bar named the T***y Twister. A thing goes awry and the bar's workers shows their real faces: vampires. So begins a fight to survive the night. <br /> <br />The 2 distinct styles of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are shown in a nice hybrid. Robert's penchant for fast editing mixes with Quentin's long takes and Quentin's usual snappy dialogue. It's funny that many people considered Quentin an influential director injecting a new type of film and dialogue into film, despite getting ideas from other films. The guys named after colors in Reservoir Dogs was from a different film, the many references in Kill Bill. So it's nice to see something that isn't so obviously familiar to film geeks. <br /> <br />The extras are definately great. You get a long documentary on the making of the movie, a featurette, deleted scenes such as more gory moments(and you thought the human being as a guitar was bad) and Robert doing commentary on his film school like features. Also it contains Robert and the very first and to date only commentary(I believe) with Quentin Tarantino and its neat seeing their differences: Robert, composed calm and descriptive while Quentin is his usual hyperkinetic self. <br /> <br />So may not like the obvious split from the Pulp Fiction/Reservoir Dogs like opening to the big Kill Bill 1 ending last half but it's what makes that second half all the more cool and this movie is cool. <br />
6305508550|5.0|With over five hundred reviews there has to be more than a few cubicle drones who've vented their frustrations.  I don't work at one of those industrial park tech firms as portrayed here but I may as well.  I have suffered more than my share of Hawaiian shirt Fridays and mandatory birthday parties than I care to count.  This film is catharsis, even wish fullfilment, for anybody stuck in a dead-end job counting away the brain cells that are eroding from their person.  Director-writer Mike Judge gets so many details right here from the insipid \\"Cathy\\" cartoons hanging in the cubicles to the malfunctioning office equipment that seems to have a personal vendetta against you.  Ron Livingston is spot on as Peter the Everyman who just wants to take this job and shove it.  Jennifer Aniston gave me a newfound respect for waitresses at strip mall eateries.  Gary Cole is spot on as the most insufferable boss you ever had.  Stephen Root gives an inspired account of the office sociopath that everyone tends to ignore.  I remember when this film first came out it barely had a run.  Fortunately for us through home video this film has a growing following.
B00006LLNU|5.0|When considering to Sigur Ros's \\"( )\\" don't purchase it with the fatuous belief that it will host a number of songs that you love and a number that you skip over. Instead consider that it is a single epic song, that reache a zeniths of rapture and hits lows of explicit sadness.  <br /> <br />With that said, the album can be catagorized into two sections; using the album title as a visual representation of this dichotomy. The former section of the curve being the beginning four tracks on this album showing the sublime heights of song 2 and 3, where lead singer jnsi's voice exhibits sounds bordering on alien. This division is best seen with through the 30+ second pause between songs four and five (five beginning the heavier half of the album). Somewhere between Thom Yorke's ghost-like sound and Chris Martin's falsetto lies jnsi. The later section of the album represented by \\")\\" exhibits a much harder, guitar driven sound best seen in the ultimate track on this album \\"Untitled #8\\", which is based around a simple distorted guitar line, that conjures imagery of cold rainfilled days and melancholy hours.  <br /> <br />Overall, Sigur Ros's \\"( )\\" is not the playful easy listening of A.B, but it certainly stands on its own as an epic.

The limited edition with a dvd. I was a bit dissapointed that it only includes the AOL SESSIONS cos if it included the videos too then it would be a great buy but if you are like me that is into LIMITED EDITION's cd's from artists I like then you would very much like this version. What is the catch to my review? I AM ONLY 15!
B000002TYX|5.0|In November of 1995, The Beatles released their 30th album entitled, ANTHOLOGY VOLUME ONE. This double-disc album features all songs from The Beatles' career. You'll get the usual released classic hits from their previous albums, as well as bootlegs and unreleased tracks. Plus, this album features a new song entitled, \\"Free As Bird\\", a new song The Beatles had recorded, before John Lennon's murder.    Disc One    FREE AS A BIRD    New song.

B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is the only show that I have religiously watched on television for years now. It's not hard to explain why. This is some of the most superb writing on television.<br /><br />I love Lorelei. She'd be my friend. She's strong and smart. She makes pizza towers and watches really bad movies over and over again. She messes things up with men...a lot. She completely loves her kid. She keeps her sense of humor through it all. Is there a better fictional woman out there?<br /><br />And, don't even get me started on Luke, Suki, Rory...etc etc.<br /><br />If you loved Northern Exposure like I did, there is something familiar here. The town is small. The cast of characters is both eccentric and eclectic. You'll love them while you want to strangle them....just like family.<br /><br />If you haven't watched the show, start here. Start at the beginning. Watch things unfold, grow, change. It's worth your time.
B000007MVD|5.0|In 1994, The Beatles released their 29th album entitled, LIVE AT THE BBC. I was not too thrilled with this album because most of the songs on this double-disc album are songs, which are all peformed live, that were not The Beatles'; songs that I've disliked or hated from day one. Some of the songs on here are to my liking, and there are twenty-five songs on here that owned by The Beatles. <br /> <br />Disc One <br /> <br />BEATLES GREETINGS <br />  Nothing special. <br /> <br />FROM US TO YOU <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />RIDING ON A BUS <br />  Hate it. <br /> <br />I GOT A WOMAN <br />  Hate it. <br /> <br />TOO MUCH MONKEY BUSINESS <br />  Hate it. <br /> <br />KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF MY BABY <br />  Hate it. <br /> <br />I'LL BE ON MY WAY <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />YOUNG BOOD <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />A SHOT OF RHYTHM AND BLUES <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />SURE TO FALL (IN LOVE WITH YOU) <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />SOME OTHER GUY <br />  Hate it. <br /> <br />THANK YOU GIRL <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />SHA LA LA LA LA <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />BABY IT'S YOU <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />THAT'S ALL RIGHT (MAMA) <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />CAROL <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />SOLDIER OF LOVE <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />A LITTLE RHYME <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />CLARABELLA <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />I'M GONNA SIT DOWN AND CRY (OVER YOU) <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />CRYING, WAITING, HOPING <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />DEAR WACK! <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />YOU REALLY GOT A HOLD ON ME <br />  Ah.

I know, I know; I should not be comparing the likes of Barry Manilow to the legendary Beatles, so strike my last statement. Not a bad song. <br /> <br />I WANNA BE YOUR MAN <br />  Great. <br /> <br />JUST A RUMOUR <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />ALL MY LOVING <br />  Great. <br /> <br />THINGS WE SAID TODAY <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />SHE'S A WOMAN <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />SWEET LITTLE SIXTEEN <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />1822 <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />LONESOME TEARS IN MY EYES <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />NOTHIN' SHAKIN' <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />THE HIPPY HIPPY SHAKE <br />  This is the only non-Beatles song that I really like on here. <br /> <br />GLAD ALL OVER <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />SO HOW COME (NO ONE LOVES ME) <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />I FEEL FINE <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />I'M A LOSER <br />  Classic. <br /> <br />EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO BE MY BABY <br />  Classic. <br /> <br />ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />TICKET TO RIDE <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />DIZZY MISS LIZZIE <br />  Great. <br /> <br />MEDLEY: Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey <br />  Great. <br /> <br />SET FIRE TO THAT LOT! <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />MATCHBOX <br />  Great. <br /> <br />I FORGOT TO REMEMBER TO FORGET <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />LOVE THESE GOON SHOWS <br />  Not bad. <br/> <br />I GOT TO FIND MY BABY <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />OOH!

This album is not very well to do, since most of the songs on here are not The Beatles', but there are 25 great Beatles songs, so go on a head and buy a copy of THE BEATLES LIVE AT THE BBC.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I'm an ICU nurse. After spending 12 hr stretches in the hospital, watching people in a hospital is not my idea of a good time; but, omg, I love this show! The chemistry between the characters is great. I am completely hooked. You can't even get me to go into work for incentive pay on a Sunday night now! Forget about it. And, should I even run into Dr. \\"McDreamy\\" in an elevator, I'm going to do just what Meredith did!

You'll see how his writing is developing and refining itself. If it's the third Dan Brown book your buying, you schould consider. <br /> <br />I read A&D and TDC in two days eatch. Now I've been reading for a week, and still ain't finished. <br /> <br />

1402543689|5.0|Each time I read one of the No.1 Ladies Detective Series, I am transported to a place where old fashioned morality, courtesy and respect are placed above all else.  It is heartening beyond all expectations.  I have purchased all of the books in the series available on CD.  Lisette Lecar is outstanding in her voicing of all the characters.  At first the phrasing and accents seem strange to the American ear, but after just a few minutes you wish everyone spoke with such caring and respect for others. I highly recommend the CD version so that you can feel it in the reading.  If you buy these books and don't like them -- for any reason -- send it back so that someone who values the true meaning of life can have it.
B0007GAERG|2.0|Ok wait just understand that i use to be  big carey fan back in the day dreams days when she was putting out music, but now what happened to the old mariah. girl friend is turning to hip hop and rap and its just not her.  <br />Shes trying to attract the young kids with her skin tight outfits and what not. <br />Just who do she thinks she is ?!! Beyonce?  <br /> <br />Oh no child you didnt dress up like Beyonce on the album cover. <br /> <br />Ok wait. you gonna like this one. I was looking for the new cd in the record store the day it came out. I actually passed her cd, thinking it was some Beyonce single release <br /> <br />I kept searching for it, i had to ask the cashier where the new mariah cd at. She's like over there girl, and i'm like , what! i moved up closer to check out the cover, I said I could of sworn that was Beyonce on the cover. Oh no she didnt. someone said she changed her skin color to match Beyonce's . Mariah is lighter than that album cover . cmon who she fooling, She cant even be herself any more. Now shes trying to be Beyonce.  <br /> <br />Ok thats when i started to roll my neck lol. what happned to her days when she could wear a proper dress and sing properly. Now a days she gotta be rap, hip hop, what not, roots , rock or reggae, what ever's the latest thing is where u will find her, so i feel dissed and since her 90's days she's let alot of fans down who supported her and she turned her backs on them and she ignored people telling her to turn down the sex stuff, she never listens and she kept going on and on, now she has turned into Beyonce, LOL , ok, wait this is crazy. Next who will she turn into, avril lavigne??? or Celine Dion ?? lol dont laugh. shes getting a show in Las vegas like Celine, no joke. lol

B00005JLSE|4.0|Chicago is the film adoption of the Broadway musical, and Catherine Zeta Jones and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger (looking more like a sheep than ever with a wooly-bah-lamb hairstyle) truly shine. Some musical numbers are really quite awesome such as \\"We Both Reached for the Gun\\" and \\"Mr. Cellophane.\\" But as I watched the film, it became clear that the producer was a man. Some of the costumes were quite bondage-looking, and the dance numbers were quite sexual and provocative. The director misses no opportunities to flash a bit of skin and I'm reminded a bit of the 'women in prison' sexploitation films from the seventies. =-/ Bleh.<br /><br />Still, this is a light-hearted glossy film with some great dance numbers and a few catchy tunes. Well worth the time and expense, even if I found the style a trifle exploitive and the plot glossing over such serious subjects as prison, murder, and spousal abuse a trifle disturbing.
B000002OX7|1.0|Creed! WOW! Amazing band. I have to give My Own Prison and Human Clay five stars each. Weathered gets four stars, though. That's pretty good in itself! Oh wait, I'm supposed to be reviewing The Who's overwrought borefest called Who's Next. Is this supposed to be a rip-off of Goldberg's catch phrase? Gosh! Idiots! This album deserves about -79 stars. It's really that bad. Though, that's better than anything Pearl Jam ever released or ever will release. Go Creed!
0698115635|2.0|I love Eric Carle's books, but this one does not measure up to his other works. It introduces an animal eating a food on each day of the week starting with Monday (not Sunday), but there is no plot and is just plain boring. Wish I hadn't spent my money on this one.
0061053430|5.0|Not much more I can add that others haven't other than to push the point home. This book is a technical sci-fi fan's dream come true. The level of detail and realism put into this book rivals that of the Star Trek technical books, and even surpasses them on some levels. This book is painstakingly researched and is an official and authorized explanation of the weapons, ships, tech and much more are covered in this book.  <br /> <br />Just about everything you could want to know about the technical aspects of the Alien and Aliens universe are here. You can know exactly how a pulse rifle or a power loader works. You can see the inner workings of a dropship. You can see the full capabilities of the Sulaco. You name it, and it's there. You even get entries for military equipment that was not in the movie, but still part of the Alien universe.  <br /> <br />Did I mention Alien? Yeah you get a ton of information on the Nostromo as well as details on the escape shuttle and equipment they used. You also get extensive details on androids as well (from both movies). They even go so far as to explain how faster than light travel works. Not only do you get all this, but you get some awesome information regarding the alien itself.  <br /> <br />The book itself is very well made considering it's labelled as a paperback. The cover is a thicker card stock and glossy on the front while the pages are made from a quality paper as well. The book quality is like what you would find on the Star Wars technical books or better. Definitely bigger than those books.   <br /> <br />I wish all sci-fi technical books would go into this much detail with their subject matter. This book is pretty much the standard I look for in other technical manuals. If you ever get a chance to find this one and are either a big Alien fan or just a big fan on these types of books I recommend getting it. For some of you even with the high prices (I think the original list price was around $20) you see in auctions and here you might still find this book worth it.
B000002I53|5.0|John Coltrane hasn't made too many sub-par LPs throughout his career. However, two LPs that really stand out are \\"A Love Supreme\\" and \\"My Favorite Things\\". And, it is my opinion that most will tell you that if you want to start with Coltrane, that you get the former LP and not the ladder. <br /> <br />I think this is an incorrect statement. However, to each his (her) own. \\"My Favorite Things\\" was a real big step forward in the genre of free-form jazz. John Coltrane, along with the rest of his band, know the tricks to improvisation at a mastery level. Being able to take such a fun tune as \\"My Favorite Things\\" and extend it into thirteen minutes of sophisticated music is a very impressive feat. There are plenty of \\"jazz greats\\" out there, but few can rival John Coltrane in his ability to not only make his improvisations sound impressive, but also sound just as formidable as his opening, inspiring tune is from the beginning of the track. <br /> <br />The title track actually demonstrates this ability the best, to me, and I think that the title track alone warrants the purchase of this all-time classic. <br /> <br />In addition, however, if you are an Amazon shopper who does not listen to jazz, and have happened to have arrived at this page by accident, keep on reading this review. <br /> <br />John Coltrane possesses a very interesting sound signature, one that I don't think any other jazz artist does today. He plays his sax in a way that a singer would sing on a rock track. He plays it so that it stands out ahead of other instruments, and he makes it sound more rich and majestic than Jon Anderson's voice, but he also makes it as complex as any other instrumental. In other words, John Coltrane's sax playing sounds much like a singer would in a rock n' roll band. To those who are unfamiliar or \\"scared\\" of the jazz genre, this means that this album is a fantastic segway into other, more serious and sublime forms of jazz music. I would highly recommend it as a first pickfor jazz music. <br /> <br />'Trane is a virtuoso, he is inviting, and he is full of expression. There is no reason why ANY music fan would not buy this record. If you don't have this LP yet, then run to the nearest store and buy it! <br /> <br />Enjoy the music! <br />-Andrew

B0009UC7QQ|5.0|Before the absurd reality shows took the airwaves by storm, director Peter Weir and writer Andrew Niccol imagined the world of Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey). Adopted and placed in a soundstage build to resemble a small American town Seahaven, Truman discovers that his life is nothing more than a TV show full of product placement. Truman discovers his friends, family and the world he lives in is nothing more than a construct. The first clue occurs when a flood light used to illuminate the massive soundstage where Truman lives falls into the middle of the street.  When Truman wants to leave the small town he lives in and go to Fiji the TV show that is when his life begins to fall apart. Although Weir didn't write the film it deals with a subject common to his films; an individual who literally is an outsider in his own world. It's also about deception. Truman like most of Weir's protagonist discovers a web of deceit that corrupts his own world.<br /><br />A brilliant film that finds Weir (\\"Witness\\", \\"The Year of Living Dangerously\\", \\"Picnic At Hanging Rock\\") in top form, it's amazing that this Oscar nominated film didn't pick up Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Writer and Best Director it was that good. Instead, the Academy rewarded \\"The Truman Show\\" like it does any film made by a Hollywood outsider-with a few awards recognizing the brilliance of the film and then settling into sublime mediocrity for the rest of the awards. There are clever visual references to Patrick MacGoohan's \\"The Prisoner\\" TV series woven into the visual motif of the film.<br /><br />Featuring a stunning anamorphic transfer, \\"The Truman Show\\" looks nearly perfect. Paramount has done a terrific job with this new edition. Colors are vibrant and bright and the image quality is amazingly sharp and crystal clear. The 5.1 sound mix makes nice use of the format with imaging placed around the speakers.<br /><br />We get a two part documentary that can either be played separately or as one. Weir, Carrey, Lara Linney and Noah Emmerich appear in interviews in the documentary. Curiously, the only person missing is writer Andrew Niccol. I'm not sure why Niccol doesn't appear in the film (perhaps he wasn't happy with some of the changes that Weir did but they work brilliantly). The fact that it closely resembles elements from Philip K. Dick's \\"Time Out of Joint\\" is also not addressed as well. The two part documentary runs about 40 minutes. The first part of the documentary focuses on the genesis of the film and some of the changes that occurred before the film was shot. The second part of the film focuses on pre-production through critical reception. This includes information on the wealthy beach community Seaside, Florida that DIDN'T want them to shoot there.<br /><br />We also get four deleted/extended scenes that provide additional information and background on the story. While they aren't essential, they are pretty fascinating to watch. There's also original theatrical trailers, TV spots and previews for other Paramount releases.<br /><br />A terrific film that was overlooked at Oscar time for far lesser films, \\"The Truman Show\\" catches Weir and his collaborators in top form. It's ironic that 10 years later the \\"reality show\\" world that was predicted came true (although not on this scale). The transfer looks terrific and the extras are certainly superior to the previous release on DVD.

It is a movie about the various interpretations of what it means to fight a war.   <br /> <br />\\"I remember when I was with Special Forces.  Seems a thousand centuries ago.  We went into a camp to inoculate the children.  We left the camp after we had inoculated the children for Polio, and this old man came running after us and he was crying.  He couldn't see.  We went back there and they had come and hacked off every inoculated arm.  There they were in a pile; a pile of little arms.  And I remember... I... I... I cried.  I wept like some grandmother.  I wanted to tear my teeth out.  I didn't know what I wanted to do.  And I want to remember it.  I never want to forget it. I never want to forget.  And then I realized... like I was shot... like I was shot with a diamond... a diamond bullet right through my forehead.  And I thought: My God... the genius of that.  The genius.  The will to do that.  Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure.  And then I realized they were stronger than we.\\" <br /> <br />This movie will challenge your ideas about war, not to change them or to promote a particular ideology, but just to inspire introspection.  If you have not yet seen this movie, it should be on the top of your \\"Must See\\" list, and the DVD provides a fantastic home theater experience.

034544678X|5.0|This is an excellent book that will give you more insight into your dog's behavior.It explains the natural behavior of dogs vs. humans, and why sometimes our most instinctive reactions to our dogs can be ineffective or even harmful to our relationship with them. Patricia McConnell is a wonderful writer who weaves excellent stories, sure to make any dog lover laugh and cry, into this information laden book. This book does not tell you specifically how to train your dog or deal with behavior problems. It explains the psychology of humans vs canines and how we can work together to enjoy each other fully. I originally got it from the library and could not put it down. By the time I was done I had to get a copy for myself. Although, I have a line of friends waiting to borrow it. Happy reading!

B0002EXH4K|5.0|Metallica and Megadeth followed career formats which were very similar. They both were thrash-metal bands from the 1980's who released three genuine thrash C.D.'s, then they gradually simplified and commercialized their sound, before finally releasing albums which were alternative (Metallica's \\"Load\\" and Megadeth's \\"Risk.\\")<br /><br />It is generally believed that Megadeth's first non-thrash album was 1990's \\"Rust in Peace,\\" but I think their first non-speed metal record was 1992's \\"Countdown to Extinction.\\" \\"Rust in Peace\\" was not only very speedy, it was also my favorite `Deth album of all time. So, compared to it's predecessor, \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" is a letdown. Megadeth probably released this album in response to Metallica's commercially successful, 1991 self-titled album. \\"Countdown\\" is quite a bit less aggressive, more slow, simple, and even more formulaic. (It has a lot less tempo changes, and most of it even follows the standard verse-chorus format). Plus, Dave Mustaine's vocals also took a little dip; they're a lot less clean, more whiney and they even get a bit irritating at times.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I still very much enjoy listening to this C.D.; it at least deserves a 4.5 star rating. Every band has to evolve and change their sound from album to album; thus, this album was, for the most part, the beginning of their evolution. Granted, speed metal freaks won't find a lot to enjoy here, but `80's metal fans (especially of bands like the Scorpions) should enjoy the many hooks (even though they're nasal ones). There are some classic tunes (i.e. \\"Skin `O My Teeth,\\" \\"Symphony of Destruction,\\" \\"Sweating Bullets,\\" and \\"Psychotron\\"), and there is still plenty of great guitar shredding to be heard. So, yes, \\"CtE\\" is definitely different, but it's still Megadeth.<br /><br />1. \\"Skin `O My Teeth\\" begins with a smattering of drums, and has catchy, groovey guitars throughout. Plus, there's a great, long guitar solo around the middle (which I believe is one of Marty Friedman's best solos).<br /><br />2. \\"Symphony of Destruction\\" is famous for its slow galloping beat and the aforementioned vocal hooks. A good, two part solo is also included.<br /><br />3. \\"Architecture of Aggression\\" begins with war sounds and gunshots, but then the fast, chugging riffs kick in.<br /><br />4. \\"Foreclosure of a Dream\\" is a song about the rise and fall of politics and economics, and it also includes George Bush Sr.'s \\"read my lips\\" quote. Part of this song sounds acoustic, and, even with some machine gun riffs and an up and down solo, its pace is quite slow.<br /><br />5. \\"Sweating Bullets\\" is one of the most well known Megadeth tunes of all time. It has a 45 second intro, but then the real song begins (with toe-tapping, \\"nah ner\\" sounding riffs, which Dave Mustaine sings in between.) The riffs are pretty simple, and Mustaine's vocals are greasy and grime-y, but this song is very catchy, nonetheless. Plus, Dave's lyrics, lines like \\"Hello me, it's me again\\" and \\"Well me, it's nice talking to myself\\" are entertaining.<br /><br />The album drags a little bit for the next three tracks. \\"This Was My Life\\" is quite catchy, and a winding, melodic solo flares up in \\"High Speed Dirt,\\" but these songs are both nothing spectacular. And track seven, the title track, is pretty slow, boring, and completely forgettable.<br /><br />Track 9, \\"Psychotron,\\" is where things pick back up. It has a good, stop-start, opening riff, but the real highlight here is the seven (count `em, seven!) guitar solos. Granted, these solos are fairly short and not nearly as good as \\"Hangar 18,\\" but they're still great. The first two make a wah-wah sound, and some of the later ones are careening.<br /><br />10. \\"Captive Honour\\" is about the prison system and the consequences of crime. It has a mid-song skit, where a judge and jury (the jury is played by Dave Mustaine's voice) sentence a man to life in prison. This song isn't instantly memorable, either, but it does have another good guitar solo (which builds greatly).<br /><br />11. \\"Ashes in Your Mouth\\" features a tempo change near the beginning, turning the song into a moderately paced chug. There's another tempo change around 2:45, with heavier drums. There are two final guitar solos (the second of which is an excellent, wailing solo), and the song ends with fading out guitars and a brief, fast drum solo.<br /><br />\\"Crown of Worms\\" is an essential part of every Megadeth diehard's collection, but the four bonus tracks are negligible.<br /><br />Like all of Megadeth's reissues, this album isn't really worth buying for the four extra tracks, but it is definitely worth buying for the improved sound quality.<br /><br />In conclusion, \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" is the sound of Megadeth evolving, while still remaining true to their roots. No, \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" isn't as great or fast as \\"Peace Sells...but Who's Buying\\" or \\"Rust In Peace;\\" but this C.D. is still greatly entertaining, catchy, and features some great, trademark Dave and Marty guitar work, so \\"Countdown\\" is definitely still a Megadeth album. Yes, Megadeth ultimately evolved so far that they made the mistake album, \\"Risk,\\" but every band needs to evolve and change their sound (for better or for worse).<br /><br />Even though not all of their albums were classic, standard setting albums, it is my opinion that (like all metal gods) every Megadeth release is necessary for every complete heavy metal collection.(which builds greatly).  <br />11. \\"Ashes in Your Mouth\\" features a tempo change near the beginning, turning the song into a moderately paced chug.

B00004XQP4|4.0|Before the trio wore eye liner and after their hardcore punk found them fame they put out this great album: Warning.  This CD has a ton of variety, including an accordian performance, solid punk, a few acoustic jams and more!<br /><br />Their punk roots are apparent in \\"Blood, Sex And Booze\\" and \\"Jackass\\", instead of being short 2 minute punk jams like before in Dookie and Nimrod, they sound a little more like rock songs, which personally, I like better.
B000063DFN|5.0|The year is 1984, and Iron Maiden are boarding a train. Bruce, Adrian, Dave, Steve, Nicko...all aboard? Now it's time to push the pedal to the metal, and don't let up until the album's over. The next stop? A classic, timeless metal album known as \\"Powerslave.\\"<br /><br />This English metal band is about as important to heavy metal as Black Sabbath and Metallica. They debuted in 1980, when bands like Ramones and Clash were popular.  So, Iron Maiden (and other New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands, like Motorhead and Judas Priest) killed off the uprising of punk, and helped to keep heavy metal alive in the `80's.<br /><br />\\"Powerslave\\" flies by at about the same pace as a Judas Priest record, but there's more to this album than just speed. Like stellar musicianship and super catchy rhythms. Plus, frontman Bruce Dickinson's vocals may be considered by some to be annoying, but I think they help to give Iron Maiden a sound of their own. His famous British-accented upper register usually shines in every song, and he also makes some good vocal hooks.<br /><br />\\"Aces High\\" begins with a chugging riff and stop-start bursts of drums. It then becomes a continuous, running beat, with some of the aforementioned high pitched singing (which sounds similar to Maiden's earlier hit, \\"Run to the Hills.\\")<br />\\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\" has another fast, catchy riff and two melodic solos. This song is really a highlight, though, because the chorus is a shout-along (well, almost).<br />\\"Losfer Words (Big `Orra)\\" is a personal favorite, because it's an instrumental. A lot of heavy metal's best albums (i.e. Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets,\\" etc.) have instrumentals, and not only does \\"Powerslave\\" have one, it has a GREAT one. This song features some great guitar work (including a classical sounding solo), and a couple of tempo changes.<br />\\"Duellists\\" is also mostly an instrumental (the middle and most of the end is free of vocals). It also has a fast, chugging riff, two more tasty solos, and a couple more speed changes.<br />\\"Powerslave\\" has mostly galloping riffs. It slows down for the middle, when there are two wailing solos, but it turns back to the galloping beat near the end.<br /><br />Even though they may not be as relevant now as they were in the 1980's, they have influenced many popular bands (like Metallica), so the spirt of Iron Maiden lives on through them. Plus, even if you don't give them credit for being one of metal's most important and influential bands, \\"Powerslave\\" is still a classic, timeless masterpiece which should always have a place in every metalhead's C.D. collection.\\"Powerslave\\" has mostly galloping riffs.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm not a huge sci-fi fan, but I'd rather watch a bad sci-fi movie than an average romatic comedy. I bought the Firefly DVD set after watching the Serenity trailer and instantly fell in love with it. My wife, who hates Star Wars and Star Trek *loves* Firefly. She can't wait to watch it with me at night.    I can't believe this show was cancelled. I hope it lives on in some form or another.    Two years later: I now watch the whole series every six months or so. It's still the best TV (no longer) on TV. I'd even go so far as to say it's on par with the best video entertainment ever. The cast is perfect, the sets are beautiful, and the writing is phenomenal. This is storytelling in the digital age at its best. I've always held a fairly narrow definition of \\"literature\\". Firefly, in my opinion, qualifies.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|I'm kind of puzzled with all the negative reviews floating around.  Hardcore fans are ripping on the packaging and completely losing site of the movie itself. <br /> <br />First, this is not a movie that stands on its own.  A first time viewer will not understand this movie.  There's too much hidden context and too many references to other works in the series. <br /> <br />Add to this the language barrier.  The captions demand the eye's attention for the majority of the movie.  I'm not going to touch the dubbing argument other than to say I personally prefer hearing the original Japanese voice actor's emotions over understanding the mechanical English voice actors. <br /> <br />Add to this the overpowering graphical presentation.  It's going to take a normal person two or three viewings to appreciate this film.  So, the whining about hearing impaired versus the non-cc captions is inane.  It's a few extra captions.  Drop it already.  The dubbing argument is more problematic.  But, in a nutshell, if a non-English audio track bothers you, skip this release. <br /> <br />The movie itself is simply brilliant.  It is one of the very FEW movies on my shelf that I would watch again and again.  I am not the type to watch Star Wars 12 times.  But this movie struck a chord with me.   <br /> <br />It's appeal is difficult to explain.  The visual presentation is flawless.  It's like watching a 3d still frame animation expo in motion.  The philisophical blending of man and machine is intriguing (although the character conversations on the subject were often flat and odd).  The action is incredible.  And getting lost in the film is much more fun than having all the pieces ahead of time.  I quite enjoyed reverse engineering the plot and figuring out what I couldn't possibly have known just from watching this movie. <br /> <br />I'm not going to make any corporate slams here or try to guess what went on in a boardroom meeting.  DVD's have been a scam from day one.  The DMCA, greed,and DVD can't be distinguished any more.  *Shrug*  I just like the movie. <br /> <br />But with that said, watch out for the ripoff sound track release.  It's an \\"anthology\\" that amounts to the soundtrack placed down on top of some slow zoom stills straight from the movie.  A friend gave me this anthology thinking it was the movie.  The anthology is junk.  Avoid it.
0312330529|5.0|IMO this has been one of the, if not the, best books depicting India, Bombay and the character of Bombayites. It is well written, descriptive and heart moving. The plot is developed very intentionally and the flow of story is capturing enough that 900 pages seems to fly-by.  <br /> <br />Having lived in Bombay, it was quite an experience to be able to visualize Lin when he described his walks on Marine Drive, Haji Ali or around Colaba. Reading about Lin and his friends meeting at Leopold, reminded me of similar times at Caf Mondegar, Bade Miyaan and Shamiana. I laughed loudly (in a plane!) when I read Prabhu explain Lin (Ling) the meaning of his name in Hindi or when the Australian fugitive learned how to curse in Hindi. I also choked, when I was reading about the struggle through the cholera epidemic or when he found out about Abdullah and Prabhu's death. <br /> <br />I can go on and on, but to summarize, it is a great book, don't matter even if you are not remotely connected to Bombay and/or India.  <br /> <br />But to all Indian/Bombayites - it is an exceptional book. I have been living outside India for the last 5+ years and it took a novel by an Australian guy, who made Bombay his home, to remind me - where my home is! <br />
6305907145|2.0|I was absolutely disappointed by Frances O'Connor's adaptation of Jane Austen's phenomenol novel: MANSFIELD PARK.  Many events in the story as seen in this movie differ from those in the actual novel. The time line is manipulated to make the movie into a more Cinderella style, rather than the dark and more matured original version in the novel.  I did, however, like the fact that the movie emphasized on the then political problems such as slavery in Antigua. <br /> <br />Manipulation of Mary Crawford's character in the movie is misleading and hints on a cinderella style of the story, which is far off from the actual novel. Jane Austen has written a simple story of a simple girl, Fanny Price, who is neither tortured or harassed for most of her stay in the Mansfield Estate under the care of Lord Thomas Bertram.   <br /> <br />Overall, the movie was made very well (cutting, color, long-short shots of camera work, choice of actors, etc.) but it lacked in substance.  The movie should have had more of the younger fanny rather than the older one. <br /> <br />I am looking forward to watching older versions of this movie to see if they have more truth to the story than this one! Do not recommend this 1999 version to anyone who enjoyed the actual novel.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|If you loved the movie, get the 2 disc edition, if only to see and hear the \\"cut\\" scene, which is a song the Phantom sings, alone in his \\"lair\\", about Christine.  I rented the movie, (watched it 4 times), and can kick myself silly for not seeing it in the theaters.  Since then, I've been haunted by the songs, (thus buying the movie AND the extended CD together).  I recommend this to all; it starts WAY back when A.L.Webber picked up a 50 cent copy of the book, and the seed was planted. <br />
B000092Q4U|1.0|we all know there is only one true lamb of god and it's not these clowns. one a scale of 1 to 5 these guys and this cd should get a zero. this is some of the most un-original music to emerge on the scene, they think with a name like this they will create some controversy and sell more cd's, wrong. the metal scene has just gone downhill since bands like this emerge onto the metal scene, todays bands have the same tuned down guitars, the vocals all sound like a barking dog doing the vocal tracks. this is not metal it's just another band trying to hop on the bandwagon of the sounds that bands like napalm death, carcass, unseen terror made so popular, it's like the black metal scene, when venom first did it everyone jumped right in on it, only back then in the mid 80's bands back then had their own sound, thy did not sound like everyonelse. you could tell them apart, like overkill did not sound like destruction, kreator did not sound like slayer,hirax did not sound like testament, save youself some money and pass on these clowns. this is not true metal.
0765348780|1.0|Started this book because I was looking for something to tide me over until the new GRRM relase: FEAST of CROWS. Just could not get into the book. At first it seems like it might take off but by page 300 it just falls flat. No character development, no sense of time (events seem to happen rather quickly without explaination and we jump dates, sometimes years, with each passing chapter), and lack of language prevented me from 'getting into' the plot. By page 450, I just didnt care anymore and put it down. Usually I try to finish every book I start, but this one is better left on the shelf.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay once again touches peoples hearts, with their melodic, piano rocking music.  This album is by far there best so far.  Parachutes, there debut album was a good album, but they still needed to improve, and they did it with A Rush of Blood To The Head, and now have made there best album of there career.  A great band always has to come out with a strong 3rd album.  Coldplay has surpassed great in this album.  They have proved to be 1 of the top 3 biggest bands in the world along with U2, and Radiohead.  <br /> <br />The Album starts off with \\"Square One\\", which starts off with a slow melodic drum beat, and then turns into a fast drum beating, guitar playing song.  \\"You just want somebody listening to what you say, It doesn't matter who you are.\\"  Chris is trying to be heard, and send a message here.  Overall I give it a 4 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br />The second track, \\"What If\\" starts off as a slow piano song, and builds into a drumming but still melodic song.  In this song chris is trying talking about a girl, and what if things happen like if the girl decides she doesnt like him, but then says, \\"How will we know, If we dont even try.\\"  That is a great message that everyone should listen to and pay attention to......  I also give this song a 4 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br />The third track \\"White Shadows\\", starts off as  an organ, and builds, into a drummy guitary upbeat song.  In this song Chris is talking about the typical system people follow, when they really something, they don't realize that what they want is right in front of them. \\"Mabe youll get what you wanted, Mabe youll stumble upon it.\\"  It's a great song, I'll give it a 5 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br />Track 4 is \\"Fix You\\" which i believe is the best track on the album.  It starts off with a slow organ, and sweet singing, and builds into an awesome guitar, and drum song, and also has some piano in it that makes it even better. Chris wrote this song for his wife, actress Gwyneth Peltrow, when her father died.  He wants to fix her.  The video for the song is awesome.  Chris is walking down the streets, of some city in Europe I think, and in the song he says that same message, \\"If You Never Try You'll Never Know Just What Your Worth.\\"  Throughout the video he is swinging a lamp around, and when the guitar kicks in he runs to the stage where there is thousands of fans, and there is fireworks, and the fans sing the ending of the song.  One of coldplays best songs.  I give it a 1000 out of 5 stars... =D <br /> <br />Track 5 is \\"Talk\\" which is another great song on the album.  The sounds very U2ish, like the \\"Boy\\" Era.  A great song.  Great guitar to.  Sounds like \\"Edge\\" from U2.  That is Coldplay's goal though, to get where U2 is.  The song is about Chris wanting to talk to someone, and get to them, and help them.  I give the song a 5 out 5 stars.  Great Song. <br /> <br />Track 6 is \\"X&Y\\", which is a slow, melodic pianoish, drummy, guitary song.  It talks about Chris trying to fix something, when its broken.  Overall I give the song a 4 out 5 songs. <br /> <br />Everyone know about the albums first single, song number 7 is \\"Speed Of Sound.\\"  Starts off with a studio piano, and in the song he sends that same message again. \\"If You Never Try Then You'll Never Know.\\"  Great song, he is talking about the creation and beggining of earth, and that no one can create god has created.  I give the song a 5 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br />Track 8, \\"A Message\\" starts off with a sweet acoustic guitar, and turns into an upbeat acoustic guitar and drums song.  Then the electric guitar, and piano kick in, and the best part of the song is the guitar solo which is at the \\"3:11\\" track duration point.  Great guitar, once again very U2ish. Chris is telling people that they dont have to be alone, and he doesnt want to be alone, and he wants his girl to come home.  Great song.  I give it a 5 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br />Track 9, \\"Low, starts off as a fast upbeat guitar and drum song.  Greatsong, very upbeat.  Chris is talking about how people should try, even if when there in the worst situations, to keep driving and going, I think when there trying to get love, and be perfect.  Great song, sounds a little U2ish.  I give it a 4 out 5 stars. <br /> <br />Track 10, \\"The Hardest Part\\" Starts off as acoustic, electric guitarish song.  Also a piano is included in the song a little song.  Pretty Good Song.  I give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br />Track 11 \\"Swallowed In The Sea,\\" starts off as a slow melodic sad singing, and then turns into a happy song.  He is talking about belonging swallowed in the sea, and then getting lost and found.  There is acoustic guitar, and upbeat drums in the song also.  Electric guitar can be heard in the background.  He also talks about a girl helping him find himself.  Great song.  I give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br />Track 12, \\"Twisted Logic\\" Stars off as a slow singing song, and then builds into a piano, electric, melodic drummy song.  He is talking about the positve and negative.  \\"You Go backwards, You Go Forwards.\\"  Another Great Song.  I give it a 4 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br />The bonus track \\"Til Kingdom Come.\\"  Very uncoldplayish and different, but thats good for music artist, starts off as a piano, and acoustic guitar song.  Kind of bluegrass music.  Songs good though.  I give it the lowest rating on the album, a 3 out of 5 stars.   <br /> <br />I would highly recomend this album, all the songs are great, i can listen to this album over and over again. Pick it up!!!!!!!!                  <br />I can't wait to see what they come out with next!!!!!!! <br />  <br /> <br />
B00007BH3Y|5.0|masterpiece from Philip Glass, it reflects all movie emotion since movie beginning until the end.  You can go from calm and quiet short periods to an inevitable rush.  A barely bearable anxiety.
B00065LY1I|5.0|I giggle everytime I think about this CD. As a kid I used to remember \\" Locamotion \\" coming on every Friday when I went rollerskating. The first cd in the 2 cd set lets you run down memory lane...and then the second cd makes you feel like you could open up a dance club in your own apartment.  <br />I enjoy Kylie's music without guilt. I don't feel she is too raunchie or explicit. This cd set was well worth the price.
0061015725|4.0|With currently 707 reviews of this book I don't know how you are going to notice mine <br /> <br />~ B U T . I . W I L L . G I V E . I T . A . G O . A N Y W A Y ~ <br /> <br />This book isn't bad. Have a quick look through the other reviews, you'll see about 1/3rd of the people loved it, 1/3rd hated it, and 1/3rd were 50-50 .... so it is worth your while trying to discover if you are in the 1/3rd who loved it. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed it. It isn't perfect. It isn't great literature. It isn't bestselling blockbuster fiction. It probably will be made into a movie, with an A-rate budget but B-rate profits. Or maybe the script will never get through ... the novel reads a bit like it was designed with a movie in mind, a thriller.  <br /> <br />The science is far from realistic, but THIS IS A NOVEL, people, this is not a textbook. Surrounded by doctors, geneticists, engineers and with skill in AI and interest in nanotechnology that puts me well above average understanding of these topics I did not have much trouble suspending my belief whilst reading this book - my secret is, when I look down and see a book in front of me, I realise IT IS A WORK OF FICTION and I don't nit-pick it to pieces. If the other reviewers can't suspend their beliefs for awhile, then it is true that the author has failed them - it is the authors' job to help people suspend their belief.  <br /> <br />I would imagine many fans of Crichton are very technical, and love his previous work for helping them suspend their belief, something they probably have trouble doing if they are scientific minded people. Although perhaps he did that in the past by presenting accepted science, not through the skill of an author.  I would say that people with some knowledge in these fields who have trouble suspending their beliefs (to allow for the inadequacy of Crichton in this novel) will probably be disappointed. They certainly sound angry in their reviews. <br /> <br />However if you can suspend your belief andmake up for his stuff ups, then you can really enjoy this novel.  <br /> <br />There isn't much else I can cover that has not been covered by the many other reviews here (which are as good a read as the novel itself) - just keep in mind that you might really enjoy the novel, perhaps give it a go.  <br /> <br />
B00001QEE7|5.0|The Little Mermaid was the last in the line of fully hand drawn animated Disney features. The story of a little mermaid named Ariel who wishes to explore the land above the sea, is supported by the music of Alan Menken and the lyrics of the late Howard Ashman. It was The Little Mermaid that heralded the renaissance of Disney animation and led to classics such as Beauty & The Beast and Aladdin. I'm not really going to go into too much detail, but suffice it to say, The Little Mermaid is an animated classic that will stay in a beloved part of your memory forever.<br /><br />This is the first limited release issue onto DVD. This edition of The Little Mermaid was a re-release in 1998 featuring improved sound and picture, but not to worry, there is no change to the content of the film itself. The DVD is presented in widescreen with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, and it has no special features to speak of.<br /><br />Obviously you will be buying this DVD because you truly love The Little Mermaid. I actually own the first VHS video release, and this 1998 re-release edition on VHS video, yet I still bought this DVD, just so I could see the film with the best quality picture and sound. I'm sure I'll buy the 2-Disc Platinum Edition DVD with actual special features when it's released on its new brought forward release time of October 2006. (Other brought forward release dates include Cinderella in October 2005, Lady & The Tramp in March 2006, The Jungle Book in March 2007 and 101 Dalmations in October 2007). And I'm sure I'll buy the High Definition DVDs too at some point in the future- all for love of The Little Mermaid. If you really love The Little Mermaid, you won't wait for October 2006- you'll buy this one, right now.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I have greatly enjoyed this season. I am looking forward to purchasing the fourth season in September. The only thing I miss with this season is the fact that the isms on are an actual cd instead of in a booklet. This way you can't look at the isms while the show is going like the other seasons. I miss that.
B0009MAO46|5.0|Buzz and Woody have been a staple of the US for 10 years now. Wow, the time does fly. I have always been a huge fan of the Toy Story series, they are SMART, FUNNY, and overall amazing. If you were not able to get the 3 DVD Set then, this is the next best thing, many of the same features are in this set. It's wonderful that they are \\"Officially\\" Re-Releasing it to market it to another generation so they can go to..<br /><br />\\"Infinity and Beyond.\\"
B0006L16N8|4.0|Consistency.  If there is one element of music that Coldplay has mastered with its latest \\"X&Y\\" album, it's consistency.  Known for their meditative music and thought-inspiring lyrics, the members of Coldplay continue the tradition of albums worth producing in this latest hit.  This record can be purchased in anticipation of the same Coldplay style found in \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" but also with confidence that the tracks will be distinctive and new. <br /> <br />\\"X&Y\\" is divided as such, with the first six of thirteen tracks representing \\"X\\" and the following six representing \\"Y\\".  (The last track is an unlisted bonus.)  They're even numbered accordingly (X1, X2...Y1, Y2, etc.).  By this division, one would expect an abrupt transition in the music from one half to the other.  However, the album flows beautifully from one track to the next, start to finish.  This is the music that you play when you want to reflect, relax, or enjoy a still summer drive with the windows down.  Coldplay has always been versatile in use, and \\"X&Y\\" does not stray from that path. <br /> <br />In addition to consistency and versatility, intrigue may be added to the list of Coldplay's musical attributes.  According to the band's website, [...] the lyrics are deliberately omitted from the liner notes to inspire listeners to derive their own meaning from the songs.  There are no explanations of the tracks, no side notes to guide listeners through the album's meaning.  It is completely open for interpretation.  This is surprising in a time where media moguls are using any and every opportunity to blatantly promote political and social opinions through the platform of fame.  Don't be misled, however; Coldplay has its causes to fight for.  That is the second part of its intrigue. <br /> <br />The members of Coldplay are passionate about their music.  There is no doubt about that.  Their passions extend far beyond the music industry though.  A quick visit to the band's website offers links to various causes that the artists themselves are fighting for.  World poverty, handgun violence, and fair trade are just a few of the issues at the forefront of Coldplay's crusade.  There is also a list of websites to visit included in the liner notes.  The activist side of the band is not limited to these lists though.  Front man Chris Martin visited Haiti to learn more about trade and also Ghana to get a firsthand view of the need for fair trade ([...]  There was no stop on a world tour to maximize profits.  It wasn't even highly publicized on Entertainment Television.  Martin went out of passion for a cause.  That is something to be noticed, because it is completely characteristic of Martin and his bandmates. <br /> <br />Coldplay releases great records.  That is safe to say.  \\"X&Y\\" is one of three so far, and surely of many more to come.  The lyrics are poetically written, the music is emotionally inspiring, and the platforms, while passionately pursued, are very much up to the listener to discover.  Nothing is forced, but everything is supplied.  You may listen and enjoy or listen and be moved to action.  Either way, Coldplay is the mode of transportation that listeners should be seeking.
B00005JNTX|4.0|To begin, do not let children see \\"Sin City.\\" It's way too much for them. In fact, if this film was shot using traditional color schemes, there's no doubt it would be rated NC-17 because of the violence. That being said, \\"Sin City\\" is a great ride of a film. It's Chandler-on-steroids, pulpy and over-the-top. The characters say things that no one could ever get away saying, do things that no one could survive doing, and act like no one else would ever act. You can tell the actors involved (especially Rourke, Murphy, Dawson and Owen) are having a great time when they're up on the screen. This movie is every actor's dream, to go overboard, and many of these people are relishing their moment to do so. Also, the look of the film is completely compelling. It is a near perfect comic-to-screen translation, which brings me to the only real flaw of the film: the length. Because it is so faithful to the source material, it goes on for probably ten minutes too long. However, if you let yourself fall into the world that is being created in front of you, you can (and probably will) have a great time. Not for everyone, for sure, but great for the people it's aiming to please.
B0000070QS|5.0|Like all successful bands, often times the lead singer wants to prove that they also have talent to write songs rather than having others write them for them.  Often times it's the same songs that were writen as part of the group effort, and more often than not it's something only for hardcore fans or a collector's item.  This is one of the rare exceptions. <br /> <br />Morten Harket has a lot to prove to US audiences.  He has the double task of proving that he has talent as an individual and that he isn't just an 80s one hit wonder with \\"Take On Me\\".  This is a good album, and I'm not just saying that because I'm an a-ha fan or because he's the most handsome man on earth.  It's a personal statement, telling us about his work in East Timor, his marriage's falling apart, and his deep feelings about just anything.  This speaks to anyone who ever had an insecurity or an interest, and that's what great song writing is all about.  Too simple?  Well, simple is better than most of the other hubris out there.  Morten's a great frontman, and a great songwriter on top of that, truly a hiden gem.
B000AR8PPK|5.0|Pulse has no word to describe it, because it is so brilliant. Pink Floyd in general must be the best, the most brilliant band ever created, where every word they say has some meaning and truth in our ever day lives. Even Roger Waters on his own must be about the best solo artist ever created on earth. Five Stars !!!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Christopher Nolan's \\"Memento\\" is a revenge story told backwards from the end to the beginning.  Our main character, Leanard(Guy Pearce) lost his short term memory one night, when two unidentified bandits invaded his home and allegedly killed his wife.  Leonard managed to gun down one of the bandits, but was pushed into a mirror by the other, knocking him out and taking away his capability to form new memories.  His motive is simple:  Find and kill his wife's killer.    When we first meet Leonard, he is well aware of his condition and knows pretty well how to deal with it---or so we think.  He is constantly on the look out for those that might want to take advantage of him and is not trusting of anyone.  He takes pictures of place, people and thing and jots down notes on them to jog his memory.    The first scene in the film is Leornard gunning down the man whom he is hunting for the rest of the film.  The rest of the movie goes backwards, explaining how Leonard came to the conclusion that the man he shoots at the start, was the second bandit involved in his wife's murder.    This movie is exceptionally well shot on film and very captivating.  This is a completly original concept, at least as far as I have ever seen and engages the viewer's full attention.  The ending is sinister and makes the viewer change the enttire perception of Leonard.  You feel total pity for the man throughout the whole film and during just the last five minutes of the film, everything changes.(I don't want to go into detail, as to not spoil this for the first-time viewers.)    Joe Pantalioni is perfect for the role of 'Teddy' a \\"friend\\" of Leonard's and is very convincing as the overly-annoying \\"nice\\" guy.    This film is well worth purchasing, as it will take a viewing or two to fully understand, appreciate and get used to the way this story is told.    Highly recommended.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I hate when I read reviews that say an artist is \\"selling out\\" \\"too pop\\" etc etc. What the heck? An artist is a 3D person just like us. Do you expect them to continually churn out similar music over and over? No, you want them to mature and grow and explore. This is what Green Day has done. This is by far their best album. Billie Joe's voice shines on it, the lyrics convey opinions/crevices of the human experience/freedom of speech perfectly, and the tunes are insanely catchy in the process. Part of being alive and human is feeling a broad range of emotion. Music is one of the best outlets for that. Green Day is utilizing music to the best of their advantage as seen through their own eyes. What is so wrong with that? How is that being a sell out? I can't stress it enough, if you haven't checked out this album DO IT! <br /> <br />I also want to applaud Green Day's live shows. They are full of brilliant energy and passion which many artist lack. I was amazed by them in the two concerts, which were in the past four months, I attended. Green Day deserves to be on top and I am definitely anticipating what they have planned next!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold have somehow managed to take Waking the Fallen and improve on it. From the killer intro of \\"The Beast and the Harlot\\" to the accoustic outro of \\"M.I.A.\\" they take you on a ride with their most diverse songs to date. Examples of this would be the intro to \\"Strength of The World\\" which sounds like it could be the opener for a Clint Eastwood western and the Flamenco style breakdown of \\"Sidewinder\\". Through all of the experimenting with sound they stay true to their huge sounds and killer riffing. To all those who are naysaying about M.Shadows not being hardcore and screaming should read the July Guitarworld where it was reported that he shredded his vocal chords and underwent sugery and had to relearn how to sing. I am amazed at how well he did considering all of this. All in all this album is a must have for any fan of the twin guitar attack metal of old.
0316777722|2.0|I had heard several of David Sedaris' hilarious NPR reports which prompted me to buy this book.  David's writing is very funny, but I got tired of him pretty fast when reading this book.  His self-absorbed personality can really get grating after awhile.  He's like the funny guest that turns obnoxious after a couple hours and you wish would just go home....
B0009R1T7M|4.0|I read everyone's reviews about this album as well as also the Pitchfork review, which raves about this peice of work. I have to say, I went in expecting A LOT. Everyone proclaimed that it was by far the album of the year and a heck of an experience. I was a tad dissapointed. This amazon page says that customers who bought this also bought Funeral by Arcade Fire, as well as Bright Eyes, so I expected something in that general area. What I found was something totally different.   <br /> <br />On some songs, Sufjan sounds a little like a male version of Frou Frou. There are yet those songs that sound like Broadway musicals. On some songs, there are choruses where women sing; that was the only annoying thing I found about this CD.  <br /> <br />The music sounds pretty original and folksy, yet a little on the safe side. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great listen, and you will surely enjoy a lot of it, just don't expect it to be the greatest album ever, which the hype seems to suggest.
B0007GAERG|3.0|After I got over the high pitch squeaks, I enjoyed the music. I think you need to be a Mariah Carey fan to love this CD. I guess now I learned to enjoy it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't even tell you how great this show is, was, and always will be. I am so obsessed with this show, I am avidly searching the Internet looking for any tidbit about the show or soon to be movie (Serenity) every spare chance I get. I am even one of the browncoats, a group of people all about Firefly and Serenity. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone. It is the best show you will ever see.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay ahs always been and always will be one of the best bands out there.  Their music is so touching and stands out so much from today's hard rock/rap culture.  Not only are the harmonics absolutely wonderful but the singing is amazing!  X & Y lived up to my expectations.  I reccomend this to anyone!
0441172717|5.0|Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto Atreides, was not supposed to be a boy. Paul's mother belongs to the Bene Gesserit, an elite group of women who have fine-tuned their muscles and nerves to the point of absolute control. The Bene Gesserit have a secret breeding plan for all the nobles of all the worlds to create the one they call Kwisatz Haderach, a male Bene Gesserit with fearsome powers. But Paul's mother disobeyed the Bene Gesserits' order to bear a girl child, and had Paul. Now Paul must learn to survive on a desert planet, and comes to realize that he may indeed be the Kwisatz Hederach. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />           Herbert's futuristic world has amazing characters and a captivating plot. The Bene Gesserit way is extremely fascinating to me. I found the idea of absolute control over the body and mind incredible. Their ability to hold completely still or to move only a single muscle was amazing to me. I also liked the desert people of Dune. Their society was so different from ours and was portrayed with great detail. They aren't at all wasteful like us today, and conserve everything to the point where they lose only a thimbleful of body water each day while living in the desert. I loved everything about this book. <br />
B0006FFRVG|5.0|I fell in love with this music in the first 5 seconds of the first song I heard.  In one sense it is alot like Coldplay but it also has it's own unique sound and style.  I have listened to each song hundreds of times and I will never get tired of it!  Their music is wonderful and the lyrics are so amazing!  If you like Coldplay you will love Keane.
0812550706|5.0|Andrew Wiggin may be humanities sole chance of survival. And he's only six years old. Andrew (known as Ender), is a military genius. The government takes him to Battle School, a training station for children that orbits the Earth. This school's purpose is to train military geniuses to destroy a great threat that looms over Earth, an alien race called the Buggers. The Buggers are ant-like creatures that almost destroyed Earth twice before, and Battle School is training children to be the ultimate weapon against their return. Ender must be a model student, because the fate of the Earth rests on his shoulders. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Ender's Game brings the reader deep into a world of child geniuses who were never really children at all. The children know the buggers are coming and know that they are humanities last chance. Card's stellar descriptions and insightful looks into these children's minds are fascinating. Reading this book, I soon came to sympathize with Ender. He is tortured by the huge responsibility he faces, and he empathizes with his enemies (both his enemies in Battle School and the Buggers). Ender was chosen for the combined qualities of empathy so he could come to know his enemy and enough aggressiveness to destroy his enemies when the time came. This story has both humor and tragedy, and every step of the way the reader is drawn further into this world where children are forced to grow up far to fast to defend humanity. <br />
0895260131|5.0|Spencers book is hard a hitting, no nonsense, non Politically Correct expose of the true Islam.  Page after page, he exposes and debunks most every \\"myth\\" about Islam, the religion of peace. <br /> <br />If you don't read another book this year, read this one!  It is both disturbing and in places frightening to think about how an Islamic state would treat you and me.  After you have read this book, you'll never call Islam the \\"religion of peace\\" again, I guarantee it! <br />
0440237688|5.0|Jonas lives in a Community. In this odd world, there is no pain, because as soon as someone is hurt, they are given pills that make the pain disappear. There is no fear, because there is nothing to fear. There is also nothing to choose. Everything anyone does is chosen for them. In this Community, there is no love, simply 'family units.' Two people who work together well are married, and can apply for children. Children are then assigned to them if they qualify. Jonas is now twelve years old, and nearing his \\"Assignment,\\" which is actually his career for the rest of his life. However, Jonas' Assignment is different from the others' Assignments in his class. Through his special Assignment, he begins to discover why his Community is the way it is, and the vast world that is being kept from him and the rest of the citizens of the Community. <br /> <br />  I've always been a fan of Lois Lowry's works, and this book is no exception. The Giver portrays a chilling 'what if' story of how it would be in a 'perfect' society. There is no pain in this Community, only the shallowest of feelings, and an oblivious populace. The whole Community is intriguing and a little on the scary side. Jonas embarks on his journey with determination and is a likeable character from the start. He has the willpower to discover the secrets of the Community, and the courage to do something about it. The ending is a little too ambiguous for my liking, but all-in-all this is a fantastic book everyone should read. <br />
1400032717|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who has read and loved anything by David Sedaris. This book seemed to have a style similar to that of Sedaris - plenty of witty humor and an entirely engaging story with real characters. <br /> <br />I found the book to be very fluid. Due to the easy-to-read yet complex, humorous writing style, I flew through this book in just a few hours.

0316172324|4.0|This book is a fascinating treatise of how we use our intuitive mind to make snap judgements.  The author takes us into situations where our mind can lead us to places we had no idea it inhabited.  We get a graphic look at how unconsciously we are prejudiced and why we react the way we do to certain people, colors, tastes, animals & inanimate objects.<br /><br />You will see clearly how you are manipulated by the marketing industry all the way back to the original marketing concepts of \\"Imperial Margarine\\" & \\"the Pepsi Challenge\\".  The material is surprsing and will help you gain insight into how marketing affects our everyday choices.  You can clearly understand how marketing affects children who are exposed to hours & hours of TV ads from infancy to adulthood.<br /><br />You come to understand that it is possible to educate your mind (ie: hone your skills) so that you can enhance your power of snap judgements, intuitions, \\"thin slicing\\", face recognition etc. to react in a rational manner to situations.<br /><br />When I first began reading this book, I thought to myself that it would make it would make a perfect companion to Gavin de Becker's book, THE GIFT OF FEAR, & I was right because Mr. Gladwell, the author of this book, begins to quote examples from Mr. de Becker's book on page 230.<br /><br />The last chapter of this book lays bare the erroneous thought that we have the ability to judge based solely on what we see and hear.  Rather that we are uncounsciously programmmed by subtle & not so subtle prejudices picked up from our families & the world around us.  If we can educate ourselves to set these thoughts aside, we might just see how much we are missing.
B0000CDL93|2.0|Oliver Stone has created a film \\"monster\\" that forsakes the facts of the Kennedy assassination, and focuses on a pure imaginary conspiracy that is the \\"brainchild\\" of New Orlean's District Attorney Jim Garrison.  Wow, does Stone ever take liberty with the facts to present Garrison's deeply flawed and unproven theory!  Yet, because he is a good dramatic filmmaker, Stone makes this film very interesting and intriguing, and leaves the (uninformed and casual) viewer with the sense that a great travesty was inflicted on the American public with the death of JKF.  In essense, Garrison's theory was that Clay Shaw, a prominant businessman in New Orleans, arranged for the assassination of JFK and recruited a bunch of shady underworld characters to do the job for him, one of which was Lee H. Oswald.  Garrison's complex theory has Lyndon Johnson as the eventual source of the asassination, as Lyndon's motivation was to obtain the power of the presidency.  Of course, there is actually NO proof of anything in Garrison's theory, and in a court trial (which is the film's climax), the case against Clay Shaw is dropped for lack of evidence and he is declared innocent.<br /><br />Garrison got a lot of press out of his theory and antics, and he was a media darling appearing on late night talk shows giving the audience nothing but innuendos and half-truths.  Yet, the public was intrigued by a man such as Garrison who so confidently proclaimed he knew the REAL truth about the Kennedy assassination and would shortly break the news and case wide open.  Of course he never did.  What he did do was ruin Clay Shaw's business and life, and all because Garrision sought personal fame and the spotlight.  Garrison used Clay Shaw to elevate himself, destroying Shaw in the process.<br /><br />Kevin Costner is excellent as Jim Garrison, and because of Stone's script and Costner's performance, the viewer wants to believe that Garrison was a man who was after the truth and acted with honor and within the law.  Unfortunately for reality, the cold hard facts say otherwise.<br /><br />Stone sets back the Kennedy assassination light years with his untruthful account and his impact on viewers who have had little exposure to the real facts about the assassination.  This is why his book is a \\"monster\\", as Stone has set off his eager viewers down a path that leads nowhere.  If Stone wanted to do service to the Kennedy assassination, he could have least selected a conspiracy theory that had some basis in fact; in this case, Garrison's theory has been shown by several authors to be completely without truth or merit - a complete fabrication of Garrison's immagination.<br /><br />While the acting and story are worth a 5-star rating, the real truth about the assassination takes a beating and I cannot give this film a positive rating.  If you want to view the film as a pure effort in fiction, then it could perhaps be rated a 4-star movie, however, it's message is that Lyndon Johnson had Kennedy killed, and this is a charge that must be taken seriously and not lightly.  Therefore, I say avoid this film.  It will fill your mind with half-truths and conspiracies and will not point you to the truth.<br /><br />Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenighin the law.

B000001FRY|3.0|This 1980 release of the band's first solo debut album did not immediately herald success for this band of four Irish men. This album is for fan's who are into the real early sounds and melodies of U2. The songs on this album were bland in sound but made up in the lyrical side with heavy hitting lyrics based on many current social issues that affects the world today. The great songs of this album were 'I Will Follow', 'A Day Without Me' and 'The Electric Co'. This was a CD I needed to get to complete my majestic U2 music collection - it is worth 3.5 stars out of 5.
B0002OERI0|5.0|this album is so amazingand the bets track on this album is got to be boulevard of broken dreams  and ameriacan idoit this one of green days more rock albums than punk album im so glad i got this album for last christmass
B000001FS6|4.0|What is not to like in this jumble of 17 songs that mixes the early sounds of U2 with their more recent and contemporary sounds. This album was first released in 1988 when U2 were definitely becoming main-stayers on the rock scene be it in Europe or the United States. This album was panned by the critics but I feel the critics mis-judged this album. You need to listen to this album more than one time for it is a CD that grows on you with time. There are songs on this album that should have never been added like 'All Along The Watchtower', 'Silver And Gold' and 'God Part II'. But the positives of the album far outweigh the negatives. Songs like the immortal 'Desire' and the romantic 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For' meet great Bono vocals in 'Pride' and 'Love Rescue Me'. All classic hits of U2. But the best of the album are the last two songs 'Bullet In The Blue Sky' and 'All I Want Is You'. These are songs that can be played at a party or alone - but the album is a pleasure to listen to.
B000001E18|4.0|I remember when I first heard this CD, around eight or so years ago. I would've been in the 10th grade, maybe the ninth. I grew up hearing anthemic hits from The Joshua Tree, and I distinctly remember hits such as 'One' and 'Mysterious Ways' from Achtung Baby before I fell upon the CD in review here. <br />While there is absolutely no comparison whatsoever between The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby, there is certainly no comparison with Zooropa with either of those albums. In fact, there is no comparison with it in regards to any of their previous or later albums. I remember falling immediately in love with this album, loving songs such as 'Lemon' and 'Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car.' <br />I ended up giving my copy of this CD to a close friend of mine, whose CDs ended up getting stolen. That was at least five years ago. In the course of those year, I lost touch with U2. This past year, I have really gotten into them again, and am finally going to see them in concert in Atlanta in November. I found a used copy of Zooropa at a store in town, and bought it. The very friend I gave my original copy to tried listening to it, but, despite his love for it years ago, couldn't get into it at all. He immediately labeled it as 'U2's worst album.' After a cursory listen, I immediately disagreed with my friend. <br />The jist of the complaints I've heard in regards to this album, and Pop---another masterpiece---and Achtung Baby, ultimately boils down to, 'It doesn't sound like The Joshua Tree.' My response to that is, 'Get over it.' <br />In fact, one thing that makes U2 so great, is that they don't play one style of music, cashing in on 'whatever sells the records.' No. They write what they want to write, and, surprise surprise, it's great. In fact, I think of U2 as the modern day Beatles, precisely due to the versitality that they have demonstrated over the 25 years or so of their musical career. Whereas some people think that their diversity is their weak point, I thinkit is precisely that which makes them legendary. <br /> <br />Cocamo Joe
B000001FA4|4.0|This magnificient album 'The Unforgettable Fire' showcased what would become some of the most endearing and popular U2 songs through the early and middle 90's to even now the mid 2000's. This album deals with racism and prejudiced views and highlights the works and wonderful words of Martin Luther King, a warrior for peace and equality. The words of King are sprinkled here and there throughout the album and for the listener it is a time to reflect and think about the legacy of this great man. For he had the courage to speak out in a time that racism was vagrant. U2, especially Bono has always been a band that has taken world issues and brought them to the spotlight of public view and this album is no different. 'Pride' and 'That Unforgettable Fire' are touching songs and even to this day and age are requested by people of all ages.<br /><br />If anything, this album is a enjoyable 45 minute journey through thought provoking views in a musical sympthony that promotes hope and desire in the human race to succeed and overcome its own embarrasing shortcomings.
0316172324|3.0|This was a quick and enjoyable read that helps to explain why snap judgements are so pervasive and sometimes valid, othertimes not.  Of particular relevance to those in law and policing are the sections implying how deeply imbedded prejudice is.  The analysis of the Amadou Diallo killing and other police shooting incidents (at the end of the book) was excellent because it makes accessible to the general public that the problem is ameliorable through better training, that it is not just demon cops or demon criminals.
0070511136|4.0|I absolutely love books based on research, and besides the catchy name, that is the single biggest selling point for SPIN Selling. Rackham is a researcher by profession, and he wrote the book after conducting an extensive research effort and then testing his theories as best he could.<br /><br />The primary conclusions of Rackham's research are that people behave differently when making major purchases than they do when making minor purchases, so salespeople should adapt their approaches to this fact. He concludes that the best salespeople interview prospects carefully, and that, to sell high-ticket items, you must get the prospect to discuss both the pain associated with the problem at hand and the positive results of fixing that problem.<br /><br />While his conclusions aren't anything new (after all, he learned all of it by watching individual salespeople do their thing), Rackham's logical approach to proving his theories should help sales managers convince salespeople to stop talking and start asking questions - eliminating a fundamental mistake made by most salespeople.<br /><br />Anyone who is struggling with the sales appointment will find value in this book, because it proves you should ask questions instead of talking all the time. However, if you're looking for more than proof of what should occur, this book is probably not for you, because easily 85 percent of the content is devoted to proving the point, rather than to helping a salesperson learn how to fix the problem. In other words, Rackham stays true to his values by describing the situation, identifying the problem, demonstrating the implication and putting value to the payoff, but then falls short of actually providing the value he says is needed to keep customers happy. If you read SPIN Selling, you will definitely learn what's broken and should be fixed, but you will be left mostly to your own devices on how to fix it.<br /><br />Enjoy,<br /><br />Gill

B000683VI4|5.0|I read the book, so I thought I wouldn't get teary from the movie. I also thought the movie might not be as good as, or just like the book. I was wrong. the movie was just as moving and very ownable. I, along with my three daughters and husband thought the movie was great! My sixteen year old daughter didn't think that the \\"young Noah\\" was a good choice when she started watching the movie, by the movies end, she thought that they couldn't do better with anyone else. All the characters were so believable! What a great job and wonderful movie.
B000000OU6|5.0|Slash is a one-of-a-kind guitar player, and any fan can pick out a new song from one of Slash's bands (the latest being Velvet Revolver) just on his unique bluesy guitar style.  After seeing the direction Axl wanted to take GNR with electronic music, it was a relief to see Slash get back to his roots, to the blues music he loved, and release this outstanding album with the very talented Eric Dover on vocals.<br /><br />This is an album for hard rock fans who thought Appetite was the best thing to come out of GNR.  If over-the-top stuff like Novemeber Rain is your favorite, you might not appreciate Slash's Snakepit as much.  This is Slash truly playing the music he wanted to do with GNR.<br /><br />There are some great blues rock songs on here, especially Be the Ball and Neither Can I.  Personally, I love Doin' Fine, which is nothing but a pure party song.  I've played that for a lot of non-GNR fans and they've enjoyed it.<br /><br />On a side note, I had the pleasure of seeing Slash's Snakepit open for AC/DC back in 2000, and Dover did a dead-on impression of Axl singing Mr. Brownstone that proved the band had a great sense of humor along with their immense talent.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki has directed many great films this one though I must say, (because I've watched it a total of 11 times-in the past 4 days,) that this is the best in the world, a great story from beginning to end, it was great.  To tell you the truth, \\"great\\" is just not good enough for it. In fact I looked it up in a thesaurus. \\"Excellent, Splendid, Swell, Grand, Top-notch, Favorable, Noble, Superior, Fit for a King\\" all this and more.  I bet I could watch this over and over without getting bored.  <br /> <br /> <br />In this movie Hayao Miyazaki included it all, action and drama, magic and war, peace and understanding. \\"He surely got it all and stuffed it in one darn wonderful story\\", as one of my best friends would say. <br /> <br /> <br /> For all you people who haven't seen it, I'll try not to spoil it for you.  In this movie \\"A courageous princess leads her people in the struggle against a powerful insect race determined to take over their land.\\" -the back of the Blockbuster case. At the beginning of the film this line is said by Patrick Stewart-\\"A thousand years have passed since the collapse of industrialized civilization, a toxic jungle now spreads threatening the last of the human race.\\" (So many big words) In my words, \\"Princess Nausica must defend her people from giant bugs trying to destroy everything.\\"-Me, Katy It's just easier that way, you see. <br /> <br /> If you are like me and like action and drama, war, guns and tanks and all that stuff you should see this movie.  The first time I saw it (I was 11) I even cried!  If you like Howls Moving Castle, you will love Nausica. <br /> <br /> If you are also like magic and peace, love and all that mushy crap, you should see this movie. (Even if you have to close your eyes and plug you ears during the tragic parts) (That was not me closing and plugging, it was my seven-year-old sister) <br /> <br /> So without further ado, THE END  (Of this review that is) <br />
B00000G3I2|4.0|I can understand why modern viewers do not appreciate this film and give it negative reviews. I was born after Vietnam, and I was too young to watch this film when it came out in 1983, but I wanted to check out what all the hype was about. Not having been a crusader for the anti-establishment in the late 60's, only to suck it up and join the corporate world by age 30, I had to really work to appreciate this movie. It is much more natural for someone who lived through having the ideals of a late 60's college age student to identify and relate to the stuggles of the characters in this film.<br /><br />Without the historical context, this is still a good movie about friendship and the ways people change in just a decade's worth of time. I caution younger viewers to keep an open mind and to put this film in perspective when they check it out.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I was initially very disappointed in this album.  I listened to it once and had little interest in listening to it again so I didn't hear it again for a few weeks.  Well, after 5 or 6 times through it started to click and now I think it is outstanding.  These guys really know how to write a song to make it sound distinctive and catchy.   <br /> <br />The nasally sound of the singer is the only downside to this album, but after awhile I didn't really notice it anymore.   <br /> <br />I'm glad I gave this one a chance, I wouldn't be surprised if I end up prefering it to their last album (which I really like).
B0007Y08IS|4.0|To begin with, this film is admirable purely on its technical achievements.  The puppets are outstanding, and they often convey more complex facial expressions that many real actors do!  I found myself amazed at the realism of the faces and eyes of the puppets.  The soundtrack of custom songs is also great, especially \\"Freedom Isn't Free.\\"<br /><br />The movie has two main plot elements:  a satire of action flicks and commentary on America's position as the world police.  The action flick satire is brilliant, especially as Team America sets off on mayhem and destruction in the name of police work, often causing more damage than the bad guys were going to do!  Your take on the war commentary will most likely depend on your personal views.<br /><br />I'm rating this film high because I admire it and I think there is an audience for it out there, but on a personal level, I thought it was drawn out just a bit too much.  It might have been better as an extended skit or a smaller bit, not a full length feature film.  South Park is superior humor and modern political/cultural commentary, in my opinion.
0393317552|5.0|For those of you who have always wondered how human fair on our planet before the Egyptian Pharaohs, this book tells it all.  The author covers the evolution of mankind all the way back from homo-erectus and explains in great details the reasons why some early hunters and gatherers evolved into farmers that  ultimately conceived of advanced tools such as writing and political systems, enabling them to ultimately dominate other less fortunate groups.  The wealth of knowledge of the author is incredible.  All aspect of evolution from plants to animals, to geography and climate are explored and used to explain our current state of evolution.  This book is a great complement for any one interested in understanding the history of mankind all the way back from our days in the trees of Africa!
0440241413|5.0|If you are considering trying out a Shopaholic book, definitely make this one your first read.  They've gotten less fun and more annoying as Kinsella has tried to ride out the Becky character for far too long.  This book, stand-alone, is completely hilarious.<br /><br />Becky is unbelievably genuine in her beliefs. She truly believes she can completely re-invent herself by buying expensive cooking equipment and cooking at home forever and ever, or that buying a dozen Christmas gifts in March means she will never have to shop again for the rest of the year.  I saw so much of myself in her, only blown up to outrageously funny and loveable proportions.  Most women will identify with some part of Becky's shopping habits.<br /><br />I'm one of the few people who didn't find Bridget Jones hilarious, and I think Kinsella managed to succeed where that book in failed, in showing us the inner workings of a slightly delusional woman via her journal of shopping or food.

0152023984|5.0|When a pilot makes an emergency landing in the Sahara desert, he is quite surprised at the appearance of mall boy. The magical and smart fellow turns out to be a little prince, who lives on a planet not bigger than a house. He entertains the pilot by asking him hundreds of questions, but slowly the pilot gets to hear the amazing history of the boy himself. He tells the stories about the planet with the three volcanoes and the extremely vain flower. The boy explains about his travels, the many Rulers of the planets that he has visited. Like the King who thinks that he rules everything, but in fact has never left his own tiny planet. Sad is the case of the guy whose job it is to light and extinguish a lantern about 1440 times a day, because the sun around his planet is travelling faster and faster.<br /><br />The Little Prince was written by Antoine de Sain-Exupery, a French author, journalist and pilot, one year before he died in 1944. Although it is written as a children's book, it contains many riddles and metaphors that will also appeal to adults. It is indeed wonderful how by visualising the imagination of a child the author brings up such a warm and comforting feeling of recognition, without getting too preachy about the so called lessons of life. Above all the story contains many layers where the silliness of the boy only reveals a poignant analysis of common human behavioural. Not without reason has this book been selected as Book of the Century in 1999 in France. Hurry to the bookstore if you have never read this wonderful book and dive into a story that will really help you to rejuvenate.
B00009W0U4|5.0|this is the first time i see a movie begin from the end and continues its way to the beginning. The way the movie presented is amazing as it begins with the resolution and that's the death of someone and the hero being carried on a stretcher away, it then cruels its way into the incident that tuened the movie upside down and that's Belluci being raped in the tunnel it then goes back to Belluci being happy with her boyfriend / real husband and her discovering that she is pregnant and dreaming about a happy life, which turns out ugly as people will see in the movie. The movie is Belluci's best since Malena. Belluci and her husband appeared in the Matrix sequels as guests, their performances were astonishing as usual, but the sequels as everyone knows where a flop. Belluci is an outstanding actress and this movie is what makes her the best European actress today.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|The point of a musical is \\"MUSIC\\".  The Phantom of the Opera is filmed beautifully. The story (even with modifications) is good. The orchestra and orchestrations are terrific. Even the direction I can accept. BUT, the singing!!  <br /> <br />Carlotta's dubbed voice -- operatic and good.  All other leads -- ??????  What are you folks doing?  Millions in production costs and your lead singers? -- Nice to look at but can we sustain a note without voices cracking?  Round those tones, sing like you mean it! <br /> <br />I'm from Boston and there have to be 500 actor/singers who could have fulfilled those roles. Go to New York or London and there are thousands.  Whoever cast those roles should be ashamed.  (It's of course possible that the \\"casting director\\" was not the person who cast the leads, so I won's jump on that person.)  But if you're going to dub Minnie Driver's voice, they should have dubbed all the leads.  Is Marnie Nixon still available?
B00009V7P8|5.0|Like many people, I suspect, I purchased this album because of the song, \\"Blower's Daughter,\\" which Mike Nichols used so brilliantly in the movie Closer.  I am quite happy that I did.  I gravitate more towards singer/songwriters as I get older, and Damien Rice is certainly a gifted member of that category.  The entire album will appeal to fans of \\"Blower's Daughter\\": all the songs are about love and loss.  The arrangements are refreshingly spare and empty (sometimes just a guitar and a cello) in this era of overproduced Muzac.  Some of the tunes might prove to be a little too \\"folksy\\" for mainstream listeners, but songs like \\"Cannonball\\" definitely make the album worth the purchase.
B0002858YS|5.0|I was debating for a few seconds whether or not to give this album 4 stars or 5 stars. After all, 5 stars means it would be among the best of the best.<br /><br />I think its up there. This is one of the best debut albums I've ever heard from a musical act.<br /><br />This album has barely left my player since I got it. It's very addiciting music. Every song is at least good - amd most of them go beyond that and are great.<br /><br />Most people know the big hits from here - \\"Mr. Brightside,\\" \\"Somebody Told Me,\\" and \\"All The Things That I've Done.\\" There are a lot of other gems here which could easily (and will probably) become hits: \\"Believe Me Natalie\\" and \\"Change Your Mind\\" are the first ones that come to my mind. I love both of them. \\"Change Your Mind\\" is a future hit just waiting to happen.<br /><br />There's so much good stuff going on musically on this album. The Killers are not just another rock band. They've got a LOT of talent.<br /><br />I think right now we're only just beginning to see the makings of a band which are going to go on and become legendary in the music industry.<br /><br />If you love great rock music, or even just music in general, then do yourself a favor and get a copy of this great album. Really listen to it and you'll end up loving it.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I'm going to break this review into three parts: for those who have seen the musical on stage, for those who haven't, and those who have read the book. <br />Firstly: If you have not seen the musical on stage.  Well, if you are not an obsessed Broadway oriented person, you'll probably like this, if you like musicals, action, and dead-sexy Opera Ghosts that is.  This movie does move slowly at points, due to the musical nature of using ten minutes of singing to potray two minutes of speech.  However, the costumes and scenery are fantastic, Gerard Butler is the best kind of eye-candy, and Emmy Rossum does a superb job of acting like a very innocent Christine. <br />Secondly: For those who have seen the stage production.  It ain't Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman.  That should be enough said right there, but I do plan to elaborate.  If you are obsessed with the stage version, or with the CDs that have their voices, then you will be disappointed.  Some lines are spoken rather than sung.  The camera has a tendency to jump around during musical numbers.  And while I did think that Christine and Raoul were well-sung, Gerard's singing voice is much rougher than Michael Crawford's and can be grating at times.  So, watch at your own risk. <br />And Thirdly: For those who have read the book.  If you haven't come in contact with the play by now, I'm rather appalled with you.  As you know, books and adaptations are notoriously different.  Here, there will be no Persian.  Or really a whole bunch of things, like true backstory and the use of Erik's real name. (i.e., the Phantom does have a name!)  So, if you are a true devotee of the gothic masterpiece, again, this film probably isn't for you. <br />Now, why did I give it four stars?  Well, I did enjoy this film immensely.  If you have no expectations that it will be a perfect adaptation of the adaptation of the book, then you can and will enjoy it.  Raoul may be a little wooden at times, but Butler plays a very passionate Phantom/Erik, and Rossum I believe to be a very good Christine.  If you're used to the CDs of Brightman/Crawford, the singing can be a little grating here... hence the four stars.  But otherwise, outstanding work, and I hope you enjoy it.
006016848X|5.0|This book nails the communication differences between men and women RIGHT ON THE HEAD!  I was so frustrated with the way my relationship was going with my husband until I read this book and learned that 1) I'm not crazy and 2)I'm not alone!!  This book is a great TOOL (with practice, of course) on how to give members of the opposite sex the KIND of love and support THEY need, instead of the kind of love/support you yourself need.   A MUST READ for EVERY marriage and EVERY relationship! (It would even help within your business relationships too!)
B000002J2D|5.0|And Then There Were Three(1978) is Genesis' first album as a trio, with the departure of Steve Hackett. When I listen to the album, there are some parts where I wish they were still a quartett, mainly because most of the songs on here really lack 12-string guitar. The album starts out with DOWN AND OUT, which is pretty good. It has excellent keyboard elements in it. UNDERTOW is one of the slowest songs on the album, it's okay but not the best. BALLAD OF BIG, which tells the story of a cowboy, sounds almost like a pop song. SNOWBOUND is definitely one of the better songs on here and Mike Rutherford's best composition. BURNING ROPE is tied for the best song on here, it goes back to the prog-rock roots of Genesis. DEEP IN THE MOTHERLODE is one of the dramas on the album. MANY TOO MANY really isn't the typical Genesis ballad and I'm saying that in a good way. SCENES FROM A NIGHT'S DREAM is the other best song on the album mainly because it is fast and catchy. SAY IT'S ALRIGHT JOE is mostly good and sounds a bit like a show tune. THE LADY LIES is great but you have to hear it a few times to appreciate it. FOLLOW YOU FOLLOW ME is the final song. The best Genesis ballad period.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Submerged into underground avant-garde art, Pop is U2's most inhuman and volcanic collection of songs they've ever done. <br /> <br />Living in a completely material era (U2 included by releasing ATYCLB and HTDAAB, iPod, buying at Grammies and all that bulls***) Pop has won the hearts and minds of a good few of us (your humble reviewer included, who found it extremely hard to remove from the CD player for a good few months). <br /> <br />Just listen to those melting chords, swelling guitars and haunting vocals, emotive climaxes and hushed comedowns, with tiny samples and electronic sounds hovering on the threshold of hearing.  <br /> <br />This album does what very few bands can achieve. It makes you feel something. Unlike ATYCLB and HTDAAB Pop really has the ability to make you feel good, lonley, cold. Strangely fascinating.  <br /> <br />I know this is a hard-listening album, but once you get to understand the music and lyrics, you get to like it, it's soft, hard, elegant, rude, ironic, euphoric, thundering, unidentifiable, controversial and even sad. <br /> <br />Absolutely breath taking! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005BL2A|2.0|Most of these songs belong on a B-side of an LP. Very little new ideas or emotion from DM. Almost as if they just put out an album of their jam sessions. Showed so little of the refined Depeche Mode lyrics or techno sounds that I am disappointed. Do nto get me wrong there are a couple of good songs on this album, but not an outstanding DM album.  <br />The 90's (Ultra, Songs of Faith and Devotion) and the new millineum (Exciter)has been unkind to the Fab Four of the Eighties. Maybe the next album will meet our expectations, I am not giving up. I hope the passion for music returns for Playing the Angel. Dave and Martin have been quoted as saying; \\"It is better to be in Depeche Mode now, than in the past 15 years.\\" Now, if they could only get back Alan and his energy, the Fab Four would truly be back!!
B00006AG9F|5.0|The single from this album - \\"Just Like An Arrow\\" - brought me into Magnum's world. And what a world ! Storytellers is a fantastic album, both the sound and Rodney Matthews' artwork. More complete than perhaps any other that they've recorded though I would rate \\"Sleepwalking\\" and \\"Rock Art\\" as both at least 4 stars... Bob Catley's voice and Tony Clarkin's words create an incredible imagery in your mind - I challenge anyone to listen to \\"Les Morts Dansants\\" and not picture the soldier shot by his comrades - \\"paper square to his heart pinned tight...\\" I've been lucky enough to have seen them live at their peak - once at Birmingham Odeon and a couple of times at Birmingham NEC. For a band that was so relatively unsuccessful in sales terms to fill a venue like the NEC was amazing. They're still around, having reformed 3 or so years ago, releasing albums and touring. Go and see them if you get the chance...
B00006EXL5|1.0|lets have a little poll, if you think MCR sucks, click yes, if not...(if i have to say....you are stupid too.)...Im sorry for comming off as a jerk, but i just favor music over...whatever this is.  MCR is for whiny \\"teen angst\\" losers.  Are you realy going to be listening to these guys in 15 years???.  ACDCs been around since the 70s and we still listen to them..Listen to some rock n roll, metal, or blues
0131103628|5.0|By chance I picked up this thin not so well typed C book from a shop, after I read through half of the book I was amazed how concise, well written, and full of insight this book is. It is the best C book I ever read. About a minute later, I realise the authors are the C founders.... well... what can i say.....
0823016714|5.0|In my 19 years as a professional animator I've never seen a book of facial expression references as extensive and well thought out as Mark Simon's book. I was pleased to see that the expressions portion of the book was organized by character types rather than expressions because the animation thought process works in the same order. The type of character needs to be established first before storyboarding and animation can begin. Gender and Age are typically a great place to start. Another great thing about this book is the uniqueness and diversity of artwork from various artists. It clearly shows how a human facial expression can be applied to a wide range of character types - from animals to mythological creatures.
1573223026|4.0|Four people who couldn't be more different in their day to day lives find they have something in common when they all prepare to jump off a famous London building known for suicides. That they don't, becomes the lift off point of the novel as these broken individuals connect with each other and parts of themselves. Four different souls: Martin, a morning television personality who was imprisoned after having sex with a minor, Jess, a turbulant teen, who has a bone to pick with anyone who'll listen, JJ a washed out American musician, and Maureen, an older woman caring for her son who is a vegetable. The premise sounds horribly depressing, but you'd be surprised how funny it is at times. The narrative shifts between the four players, some working more successfully than others, namely Maureen's who I felt had the most satisfying and interesting character arc. The book has some unexpected and funny turns and manages to be heartfelt without dipping into sentimentality. A good summer read.
6305311463|3.0|All the other reviews of this DVD seem to simply trash the flick without considering that it is just that: a flick.  And, an ACTION flick none the less.  It's no Citizen Kane or Casablanca, but I'm proud to have it up on my DVD shelf with the greats.        So I'm takin' the high road, folks.  I'll say it: I'm a Michael Bay fan.  Yup.  I like this movie, especially the Criterion edition.  Unlike the other Amazon reviewers, I enjoy the ridiculous gravity simulations and all the other little inconsistencies.  Hell, that's a staple of the Michael Bay film.  Remember The Rock?     Anyway, back to the case at hand.  If you know Criterion, you know why their editions cost almost double the regular studio releases--often much more if the title is out of print.  If not, check out their homepage at [...]  I wouldn't buy the Criterion edition of Armageddon unless, 1) you've seen the film, like it, and want to own the definitive version 2) are a Criterion collector, and you've ' just gotta have it.'  If you're just looking to watch the movie and then throw it on a shelf, I'd go with the Touchstone version available on Amazon for under $12.      What's the difference between the two?  First of all, the Criterion transfer is digitally remastered and is beautiful.  In a movie governed by special effects, it really makes a difference.  Also the sound is far superior to the Touchstone release.  If you don't have a home stereo set-up this may not be relevant to you...but even if you don't the movie's going to sound better on Criterion.    The gag reel on the Criterion is exclusive to the Criterion release...and is rather crude.  That's why I like it.  They show what the guys in the film were really like during filming.  If you are offended by certain four letter words, stay away from this part.      There is an analysis of the special effects that's real cool, as well.  All I could think while watching the movie for the first time was, \\"Wow.  This must've cost a LOT.\\"  And I was right.  The special effects reel shows you how they composed a few of the action sequences.      Finally, the Criterion edition is real hard to find.  Try searching for it in your local retailers.  Bootlegs of the DVD seem to floating around, as well.  Amazon is a quick, easy way to secure an authentic copy.      That's about all I've got to say, and frankly, Amazon ain't paying me a dime for these words so I don't care if this review was helpful to you or not...    Al Sacco  [...]
B000002KDS|5.0|\\"KILLER\\"    REVIEW:    What can one say about \\"Killer\\" other than to say it is a rock and roll masterpiece. Truly. All eight tracks are just flat out excellent. The album achieves tremendous lyrical content, flawless drumming by Neal Smith and great vocals by Alice. For the uninitiated, start here.    MUSICIANS:    Alice Cooper... Vocals and Harmonica    Neal Smith ... Drums and Vocals   Dennis Dunaway ... Bass and Vocals   Glen Buxton ... Lead Guitar   Michael Bruce ...  Rhythm Guitar, Vocals, Piano and Organ   Bob Ezrin ... Keyboards, Mini-Moog   Rick Derringer ... Guitar on 'Under My Wheels' and 'Yeah Yeah Yeah'   Reggie Vincent ... Backing Vocals    INTERESTING FACTS:    1. An early working title for the track \\"Desperado\\" was \\"Desert Nights\\".    2. The click sound at the end of 'Be My Lover' is Neal Smith dropping his drumsticks.    3. 'Halo of Flies' was a mixture of three different songs that Alice would eventually \\"arrange\\".    4. The album was released in November of 1971 and would peak at #21 on the Billboard Top 200. The album would be certified a Platinum seller.    5. The singles \\"Be My Lover\\" peaked at #49 and \\"Under My Wheels\\" peaked at #59.    PACKAGING:    The words \\"Killer\\" were written by the right-handed Dennis Dunaway left-handed while Neal Smith's snake, Kachina, is photographed on the simplistic but effective album cover. Booklet features song credits, musician credits and a \\"NOTES\\" page.    APPROX. RUNNING TIME:    35 min. and 15 sec.    FINAL ANALYSIS:    Another definitve Alice Cooper album under the production of the great Bob Ezrin. ***** out of 5. A MUST HAVE!!!
B00005JLKB|5.0|I haven't been a Smallville fan for long, but I stumbled across it while flipping through the channels n I was hooked. The first season is all about Clark figuring out who he is, and that he's not from around here. He learns about the effect the meteor rocks have on him, that he has x-ray vision, and is pretty much inpenitrable. Also Chloe, Clark, Pete, and Lana work together and tie all the weird happenins in Smallville to the meteor rocks, and it's pretty much up to Clark to save them.

1573223026|3.0|I have to say I liked High Fidelity and About a Boy much better than this novel. It felt a little bit as if Hornby were going through the motions. He does his usual stream-of-consciousness thing with the characters' internal monologues, but it comes across as each of the characters being much more analytical than they would otherwise seem. <br /> <br />The fracturing of the narrative across four viewpoints was also a problem. The book jacket touted them as \\"four distinct voices,\\" but at first, they really weren't. About halfway through the book, they became distinct. Before that, the changes felt jarring. <br /> <br />Also, I don't think he handled the topic as well as he could have. It came across as kind of glib with a manufactured sunny ending. I don't think it was a realistic depiction of how suicidal people feel, with the possible exception of Martin, who had loads of self-loathing but was not very likable. <br /> <br />That said, if you like Hornby, you should probably read this. Just check it out of the library, as I did, rather than buying it in hardcover. Or wait for the paperback.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you haven't seen the show already, Firefly is a fantastic genre blending ScifiWestern.  The writing is beyond witty, each episode full of humor, suspense, adventure and drama.  This DVD set contains all the original episodes (including three not aired by FOX)in the intended wide-screen format, allowing the viewer to experience the full impact of Firefly's artistic cinematography.  It also features extras such as behind the scenes specials, interviews with the cast and crew, a gag reel and commentaries.<br /><br />The show is a must see, but not recommended for kids under 13, because there are some sexual themes (no frontal nudity) along with mild cursing and some violence in the form of gunfights and fisticuffs.  For anyone else, Firefly is a genius show that was cancelled before its time!<br /><br />Look out for Serenity appearing in theaters this fall... and to all my fellow Browncoats... Keep Flying!  You can't stop the signal.
B000006XSD|2.0|<br />\\"LACE AND WHISKEY\\" <br /> <br />REVIEW: <br /> <br />This has to be Alice's most inconsistent album. The albums only real standout tracks are \\"It's Hot Tonight,\\" \\"You And Me,\\" the funny \\"King of the Silver Screen\\" and the gut-wrenchingly sad \\"I Never Wrote Those Songs\\". But this album may be home to the worst Alice Cooper song and that's the Chas Underwood-penned track, \\"Ubangi Stomp\\". Both \\"(No More) Love At Your Convienence\\" and \\"My God\\" aren't very good either while \\"Lace And Whiskey,\\" \\"Road Rats,\\" and \\"Damned If You Do\\" are nothing more than just decent.  <br /> <br />THE PLAYERS: <br /> <br />Dick Wagner - Guitars, Vocals  <br />Bob Ezrin - Keyboards, Vocals  <br />Steve Hunter - Guitars  <br />Babbitt - Bass  <br />Tony Levin - Bass (\\"Lace And Whiskey,\\" \\"Damned If You Do,\\" and \\"Ubangi Stomp\\")  <br />John Prakash - Bass (\\"Road Rats\\")  <br />Allan Schwartzberg - Drums  <br />Jim Gordon - Drums (\\"Road Rats,\\" \\"Damned If You Do,\\" and \\"You And Me\\") <br />Jim Maelen - percussion, vocals  <br />Jozef Chirowski - keyboards  <br />Al Macmillan - Piano (\\"Damned If You Do\\")  <br />Al Kooper - piano (\\"Damned If You Do\\")  <br />Ernie Watts - tenor sax and clarinet  <br />Venetta Fields, Julia Tillman, Lorna Willard - Vocals (\\"Road Rats\\")  <br />Douglas Neslund and the California Boys' Choir - vocals  <br /> <br />INTERESTING FACTS: <br /> <br />1. Released in April of 1977, \\"Lace And Whiskey\\" peaked at #42 on the Billboard Top 200. Despite having a Top 10 hit single (\\"You And Me\\") this has yet to be certified by the R.I.A.A for sales in excess of 500,000 copies sold. <br /> <br />2. \\"You And Me\\" would later be covered by the late Frank Sinatra at the Hollywood bowl. <br /> <br />3. \\"Lace And Whiskey\\" was Alice's highest chart placing album in Australia at #3. <br /> <br />PACKAGING: <br /> <br />The front and back cover are cool concepts while the booklet does feature the album's lyrics. <br /> <br />APPROX. RUNNING TIME: <br /> <br />40 min. and 16 sec. <br /> <br />FINAL ANALYSIS: <br /> <br />This was Alice's worst album up until this point but it is intriguing to listen to if nothing more than to wonder \\"what the hell were they thinking?\\". This is - however - the worst Alice Cooper album that Bob Ezrin has produced. **1/2 out of 5.  <br /> <br />
0792164903|5.0|I am a big Tim Burton fan. I love look and feel of all of his movies. I always liked the tale of Sleepy Hollow as a child and was very excited to hear Tim Burton was making a movie about it with my other fav. Johnny Depp. A great movie with a great cast. If you like a good mystery/ghost story, buy this one you won't regret it.
B00005JLEU|4.0|I can't say anything about Spirited Away that hasn't already been said.  I saw the film three times in the theater and absolutely adored it, and I purchased the DVD as soon as it was available Stateside. <br /> <br />However, I was deeply disappointed by the English subtitles.  Rather than subtitling the original subtle Japanese dialog, the English dubbed dialog is subtitled.  This creates a strange disconnect when viewing the film with Japanese voices and English subtitles, because subtitles appear when nothing is being said.  Worse, the English dialog apparently gives away certain details that are left ambiguous or delayed in the Japanese version (such as Haku's true nature). <br /> <br />I am currently searching for an alternate version of the film on DVD which is not similarly flawed, but I found this peculiarity disappointing and would not have bought the DVD if I had known about it in advance.
1400031087|5.0|At first I shied away from this book, thinking it would be too depressing. Then I tried it out when I couldn't get through John Irving's new book, and I was riveted right away. <br /> <br />This is a first-person, nonfiction account of James Frey's time in a rehab institution in Minnesota after he got so drunk and high that he fell down a fire escape on his face. It recounts his growing friendship with the other inmates, his stubborn refusal to learn about AA or work the Twelve Steps, his root canals without anesthesia, his forbidden relationship with a girl in rehab, his coming to terms with his parents, and his unstinting look at his own past. It's a no-holds-barred account and it's written beautifully. <br /> <br />I have already put the sequel on hold at the library.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|Some Kind of Monster can be simply described as the best documentary ever. You get behind the minds of the creators of classic albums like The Black Album (Metallica), Kill 'Em All and Load (only to name a few). This film builds a bond between you and the band. You feel for Hetfield and his problems. I was particularly sad for Kirk Hammet due to his lack of having much of a say in the band. Hetfield and Ulrich are the two remaining founding members of Metallica and they often times show it. I am not speaking for everybody, but as a pretty big metal fan, the best part has to be the conversation between Lars Ulrich and Dave Mustaine. If you call yourself a fan of Metallica and/or Megadeth, I don't need to explain the signifigance of this confrontation. You also get to see the making of St. Anger, Metallica's newest album. It's not their best, but it is a descent Metallica flash from the past. <br />Even if you are not a huge Metallica fan, this movie is still very intruiging. The interactions between the band are at times funny, angry, sad, etc. I was a little mad at Lars Ulrich for the Napster thing, but after seeing this film, it became understandable, a little bit.  <br />P.S. FOR THE RECORD, DON'T STOP LISTENING TO METALLICA BECAUSE OF THE NAPSTER INCIDENT SEL YEARS BACK. THAT WAS MOSTLY CAUSED BY ULRICH. HAMMET AND HETFIELD DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH THAT.
B000022TSW|5.0|This movie is probably the funniest movies I have seen in a while, along with Team America. Who cares about the rating? This movie is good for under the age of 17 also. I just seen it yesterday and I'm 13.
B0002S94OS|5.0|I think it is sad that some people can rate this album lower beacsue they \\"don't love politics.\\"  Lamb of God is one of the only bands who can tell that this country is in the waining stages of a democracy and has the balls to write about it.  If more people could grasp this and maybe particiapate in their own government maybe this country could be rescued from idiot Bush and pulled out of the toilet.  Not to mention the musicality of this album is far superior to most any metal or hardcore or whatever you call it album out there.  Hopefully LoG can continue on this brilliant path.
0739313126|4.0|I bought the audio version of the book because it's 18 hours long and I had an 18 hour car trip to make.  It definitely passed the time and was worth every penny, but I have to give it only 4 stars because of some picky things with the reader...<br /><br />He does a good job doing female voices and his narration is pretty good (except when he gets confused and does an accent during the narration parts) but his \\"evil French guy\\" accents (there are at least 3) sound EXACTLY like Strongbad.  If you don't know who Strongbad is, then this won't bother you a bit.  Also I can't decide if the albino monk comes off as a total idiot because of the reader or the writing.  But I wanted to fast forward through his parts (except, heck, I had 18 hours to kill).
B0002OERI0|5.0|Why are so many of you hating on Green Day so much?  I, of all people, never ever thought I'd enjoy anything they ever put out.  I see reviews calling the band \\"sellouts\\", but what makes a band a sellout?  They aren't a punk band in the first place!  They've always been a pop band that tends to \\"borrow\\" from their punk roots from time to time.  So what's wrong with that?   <br /> <br />I remember when I was of prime Green Day listening age, when Dookie first hit the shelves.  Some people say that American Idiot is overexposed, taking over MTV and radio.  Well I remember when Basket Case was on MTV nearly 900 times a day.  My god, I really hated that song. <br /> <br />The point I'm trying to make here is that with this album, Green Day has done nothing so awful as to sell out.  They've always been pop.  So what?  It's damn good pop music, bottom line
B00005ONMJ|5.0|I wish I could give Furtwangler's DON GIOVANNI 6 stars, as it is a great performance.  If you buy this, you are in for a real treat.  The sound is 1954 mono, and the picture quality is very good for it's age.  If the color looks a little washed out, one can always adjust the color and/or tint on their TV set.  There is an audience present,applause when Furtwangler enters to conduct the overture, but they are very quiet through the opera, if they are present at all.  There is no applause or curtain calls at the end. <br /> <br />The singers are terrific, especially Siepi, Edelmann, Della Casa, Grummer, and Berger.  They work wonderfully as an ensemble and as soloists. Sound balances between singers and orchestra are also excellent. There are audio recordings of these same soloists working with Furtwangler in this and other operas during the early 1950s, so they were obviously quite used to working together.  Della Casa, Grummer, and Berger are the best in the females roles that I have heard, and I have seven recordings of this work, between CD and DVD releases. <br /> <br />DG is to be commended for keeping this before the public, as are the video director of this production, and those who worked 51 years ago to preserve it for the ages. Highly recommended! <br /> <br />
B0006284JQ|1.0|Britney Spears is an awful singer! She can't hit any notes, maybe two. Her concerts are fake too. I can't stand her! The only song I like is \\"Everytime\\". Oh, and this CD is not by Britney Spears, it's by the Apple Computer Company, because she uses computers for almost all of her voice, lol, what a fake. Just as bad as Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan. The earlier reviewer must be a kid, just because your songs are big doesn't mean your music is good!!! Avoid this!!!
1400032717|5.0|A professor of mine once said that the purpose of reading fiction was to have a vicarious experience impossible in real life.  Rarely, if ever, have I encountered a better and more intriguing proof of that concept.  Mr. Haddon's protagonist is autistic to a degree that at once allows him the privilege of being a disinterested observer of our world while at the same time being functional to a degree that raises the question in the reader's mind as to whether life is actually more fulfilling with or without the emotions, attachments and social rules in which the rest of us are immersed.  It is a very quick read.  The plot moves briskly and the characters are wonderfully developed.<br /><br />The author neatly interweaves his various themes into a quest novel--a quest no less epic in its unique fashion than any of the great works.  The work is profoundly moving.  The journey Mr. Haddon portrays is shared by all if not experienced in the same fashion.  It is outstanding fiction and is my first recommendation to anyone looking for a good read.
B00092ZL80|5.0|First, can we finally admit that old music is BETTER than the stuff that poses for pop and rock these days? With some exceptions, this is true. Why? Because old rock and rollers often had roots in other forms of music. Or, they studied music somewhere. Or they paid amazing dues before getting signed. In the case of Chicago and EWF, both bands have credentials that go into classical and jazz. Both are amazing to watch and do their material effortlessly. Even at the age they're at, (Chicago members near or at 60 years old, EWF in their 50's) these guys play with energy, enthusiasm and passion. With that editorial done, we're ready to talk about this DVD. <br /> <br />There is so much here, I'll just highlight what goes beyond amazing. The opening has both bands onstage doing \\"Beginnings\\" which ironically is what Chicago would often close a show with in years gone by. I was immediately struck with the energy and youthful look of founder Robert Lamm. At 60, he still looks and sounds authentic. His voice has only deepened slighty over the last 38 years. This makes all the Lamm tunes very enjoyable, \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is\\", \\"Beginnings\\" and \\"Saturday In The Park\\" are all smokin', yet smooth and like the original 45's. Lamm even takes Terry Kath's \\"Color My World\\" and gives it new life. Kath was the original guitarist who was killed in a freak shooting accident. Kath's absense from Chicago haunted them from his death in 1976 up until his replacement, Bill Champlin was selected in 1982. Champlin and David Foster are often given the credit for revitalizing Chicago. Truth is that Robert Lamm has led this band with all the right personnel decisions, much like a great football coach.  <br /> <br />EWF takes the stage solo and slams through a set featuring one of the greatest soul singers of all time, Mr. Phillip Bailey. Bailey even joins Chicago later for \\"If You Leave Me Now\\". Bailey's take on Peter Cetera might be a little unsettling to some diehard Chicagoans, but this works, mainly due to Bailey's unbelievable voice. Needless to say, the EWF set which concludes with \\"Mighty, Mighty\\" has the crowd dancing, smiling and singing. <br /> <br />Chicago returns solo with the \\"Make Me Smile\\" medley which contains some great deep cuts from Chicago's earliest works. This is a great part of the show for old FM radio buffs. \\"Mongonucleosis\\" is an instrumental tune featuring Lee Loughnane on trumpet and Jimmy Pankow on the congas. A fantasic mix of everything Chicago represents. \\"Old Days\\" is a surprise in that Peter Cetera used to hate the song, yet the current Chicago has always included it in their set list. The big surpise is that guitarist Keith Howland (the yoot of the band) sings it on key and plays a great lead to boot. Another unexpected inclusion in the set list is \\"Alive Again\\". Here, Jason Scheff shows why he was able to fill Cetera's shoes. In fact, Scheff gets better and better as the show progresses, masterfully handling \\"Just You N' Me\\", \\"Hard Habit To break\\", \\"Call On Me\\", \\"Feelin' Stronger\\" as well as his great youthful take on \\"I'm A Man\\" and \\"25 or 6 to 4\\". Scheff is great on bass as well. <br /> <br />One of the great moments on the DVD is during \\"Just You N Me\\" where Walter Parazaider does this flute solo that can only be desicribed as part scat, part jethro tull, part world music and part fusion. When the song concludes, Jason Scheff says \\"lets here it for Walter Parazaider and that killer flute solo\\". The crowd erupts as Robert Lamm chimes in, \\"you did good Walter, you did very good\\"...And then Lamm hits the first few keys that begin \\"Saturday In The Park\\". This to me was one of the greatest one-two punches in concert history.  <br /> <br />EWF returns and both bands do an amazingly smooth \\"September\\" with Bill Champlin adding great soulful vocals to the already R&B drenched production. \\"Free\\" comes on with the American flag draped in back. The horns are pumped up throughout this ending set. \\"Sing A Song\\"finds everybody getting a crack at lead vocal, and the mix is near perfect. \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is\\" is amazing. It's encored by a sizzling \\"25 or 6 to 4\\", with both bands jamming at full tilt. This concludes a show that is exhausting and totally fulfilling. The material chosen is perfect. The concert energy is dazzling. The spectacle will leave you wanting to watch it again and again. This is as good as it gets!!!
B00006AUIG|5.0|Plot: Danvers Asylum has been closed for a long time now. A cleaning crew has been assigned to remove all of the harmful chemicals and such that have built up throughout the building over the years. They must do this in only one week. The problem is, Danvers is a massive place. It will be quite stressful, but the men need the job. Surely enough, the old asylum begins to work on the crew's nerves. Although they are together, working side-by-side everyday, they each become more and more withdrawn to their own thoughts inspired by the creepy building. One member of the crew has discovered a series of old audio recordings of a psychiatrist and an inpatient named Mary -- a dissociative woman with multiple personalities. Something horrible had happened -- the thing that landed her in the asylum. And, as the tapes go on, more and more is revealed. Session number nine, the last session, holds the key to what happened and why Mary is so disturbed as she is. Terrifyingly enough, one crew member has been driven to the same edge. And, before the week is over, the tension becomes too much. Death occurs, and horrors beyond the boundaries of any sane imagination take over.<br /><br />Session 9, upon the first viewing, is one of the creepiest films you could ask for. It's one of those \\"it's not what you see, it's what you don't see\\" feelings of dread that haunt the audience in the same way the characters are haunted. You never know what's going to happen. But don't think it's just another fix for a Saturday night creep-out. It is also great for multiple viewings because, it seems, each time you watch it, you catch little bits and pieces you didn't notice before that really get you thinking. Even though you'll know what happens at the end, you'll still find it plenty enjoyable just to see it all unfold time after time. Plus, the Session 9 DVD has some great special features, including a documentary on Danvers (yep, it's a real place) and the filming of the movie, deleted scenes, and more (as a little hint, you might want to use the director's commentary on the deleted scenes in order to understand how they fit into the plot). Session 9 is an excellent thriller/horror movie that deserves a spot in every DVD collection.s a little hint, you might want to use the director's commentary on the deleted scenes in order to understand how they fit into the plot).

B00030EIXW|5.0|These are excellent performances, but they are electric with very fast allegro movements.  Not all listeners will respond well to them:  fans of Furtwangler, Bohm, and Bruno Walter in these symphonies may not like Kleiber, considering him too glib, and that he misses/glosses over important points.  But the precision of the Concertgebouw Orchestra players is thrilling!    Sound quality and picture quality are both excellent.  DVD picture is full screen, and has great perspectives/shots of Kleiber in dramatic moments or of a flute, clarinet, oboe, etc. player when they have a solo lick/passage.    The Concertgebouw Orchestra plays better for Kleiber in Symphony 4 here than the Bavarian State Orchestra (also a live recording) did in 1982 (Orfeo CD).  Kleiber's 7th here is superior to his Vienna Philharmonic studio recording from 1976(DG CD): I and IV sparkle more here.  The intensity and excitement of playing in front of a live audience helps.   The audience clearly loved Kleiber, and it shows.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Wow, I like Christina Aguilera! I thought her album was going to be like Britney Spears's \\"In The Zone\\", like a \\"yeah, whatever, she'll be gone in a year\\", this girl actually has pipes! Her concerts are not fake like Britney, she can really sing! Once listen to \\"The Voice Within\\" should blow you away. My favorite song is \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\", because it's very catchy and has Lil' Kim in it. Buy this CD today!
B00005JLEU|5.0|It is the rare work that can transport one to a completely new world both familiar and strange.  It is an even rarer work that speaks to both children and adults.  In my personal opinion, the American public does not demand quality from its artists--sure, there is the occasional serendipitous work that manages to find financing and an audience; however, in large part it takes an artist of great perserverance and no small amount of luck to reach the audience.<br /><br />Based on this work alone, Mr. Miyazaki's movies are on my instant purchase list.  Other reviews adequately treat a summary of the story and the various strengths of the work--I would like to just state that it is our responsibility to demand and support art of this magnificent quality.  This is art that affirms life and teaches that virtue is its own reward, that moderation and patience can conquer difficult problems and that sometimes we need to have terrible experiences in order to discover our inner strength.  (And, it is a fun movie to watch.)<br /><br />I can't think of a better family movie.  At once entertaining and instructive, its only negative for me was that this work exposes most other movies as utterly worthless dreck.
B0009A40ES|4.0|Some of the extras are a lot of fun, such as those with the filmmakers talking about how the film came to be and what they wanted to do with it, and some of them, such as an analysis of New York in the 80s, were quite uninteresting. The trailers and tv spots included here were priceless. There's an essay in the sleeve that's a good read as well.
B0002EXH4A|1.0|Whatever you do, don't buy this CD.  I thought the remastering would be just cleaning up the hiss and the vocals some.  This sounds like Dave stripped off the old vocals and laid down new ones to emphasize his voice.  They took out the aggressive sound to the songs and made it a cookie cutter version of the original.  The only good part to it are the last 4 songs, that supposedly have never been heard before.  These actually sound like the original songs.  Find yourself a version of the original CD, you will be much happier with it than this piece of junk.
0440211727|5.0|I'm sure you've read the story synopsis, so I won't bore you with it.<br /><br />So why did I give it 5 stars? In short, it's a legal thriller at its best. The main character, Jake Brigance - defense lawyer for Carl Lee Hailey, is hardly endearing - he's openly hateful towards his secretary, lies to his wife, submits to the temptation of alcohol when the heat comes down. However, in reality, it makes the character more real - nobody's perfect, everyone has their dark sides. Sure, he's hounding after the publicity at first, but he also comes to care about the fate of his client, and while he flirts with his law clerk (always got a chuckle out of \\"Row Ark\\") he doesn't submit to THAT temptation and stays true to his wife.<br /><br />The topic is interesting - how the law should treat a vigilante killer. Yet deeper than that is the fundamental question of equality of treatment between whites and blacks in the law. Yes, the law itself holds all people as equal, but it's the eyes of the 12 jury members that really determines the guilt or innocence of a person.<br /><br />The characters are well crafted - not all likeable, but at least, for the most part, believable. The pace of the story nicely snowballs - adding in essential tension with the addition of the Klu Klux Klan's involvement in the proceedings.<br /><br />So it certainly deserves the 5 stars and I thoroughly recommend it it anyone (which is more than I can say for the movie adaptation, but that's another story!)
B0007VZ9DK|1.0|I bought this DVD about 3 weeks ago and have returned it for a third time because the format that Universal chose for this cool movie is horrible. I have had problems with Universal products before such as \\"The Abbott and Costello\\" Collection where the DVDs freeze up on my player. It is not the player's fault because each one that I have gotten to replace the defects have had the same problem occur in different parts of the film. I know from a documentary that I saw about ten years ago that Universal Studios was known as the cheapest hollywood studio and it seems that not much has changed. Be warned for those of you that already have this on the older DVD release to just keep it. I did not pick it up until this copy came out so I will have to keep trying until I find one that works.
B00001QEE8|5.0|While it does not possess any concrete plot of any kind, this is a perfect family movie/musical. It's the songs that make this the best Disney movie of all time, and the animation is top notch. Here are my three favourite scenes...<br />1. Trust in me (The Hypnotizing scene)<BR>My favourite scene from the whole film when I was a kid, and now my daughter's favourite moment too. With some wonderful animation combined with the film's BEST song, as Kaa the giant python hypnotizes Mowgli in a tree top.<br />2 Tiger Fight<BR>Filled with lots of simply stunning and often intense animation, this provides a suitable climax to the movie.<br />3. Baloo vs Monkeys<BR>A really funny scene in which Baloo is completely humiliated by a pack of King Louie's henchman.<br />These scenes and a lot more make for a fantastic film. Now all we need is a two-disc special edition dvd.

0060556501|3.0|I don't mind the truncation of the story.  I don't think Aslan appears weak.  But the writing is technically very poor.  It is absolute ellipsis *hell*.  Check out this unmodified passage from the first/second page (it has a nasty habit of splitting sentences across page turns): <br /> <br />\\"And of course, right here on this side of the wardrobe, were four children ... Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy ... all of them longing for adventure. Lucy, the youngest, and most longing, was first to push past the furry coats ... [turn page] ... and find herself in a snowy wood, under a streetlamp ... where the Witch's wickedness had made it always winter.\\" <br /> <br />It's just awful reading this to my daughter.  I am tempted to make up my own version.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|The sticker placed on this album makes a bold statment: \\"'Demigod' is the 'Alters of Madness' of this generation; a truely perfect death metal album.\\" After thoroughly listening to the album, I can only conclude that the above sentiment is actually an UNDERSTATMENT!     \\"Demigod\\" may very well be the best death metal album ever recorded. I say this for a number of reasons:    (a) \\"Demigod\\" manages to capture the immense musical talents of the three death metal virtuosos who make up Behemoth. You will be hard pressed to find three musicians within this genre of music (or any for that matter) who have completely mastered their instruments to such a degree. Nergal possesses one of the finest death metal voices. Throughout the album he simultaneously mixes his lower death growls with midrange/ higher pitches which create an almost demonic sound to the vocals. In addition, Nergal is an outstanding guitar player who creates some of the most memorable riffs you will hear on any extreme metal album. Orion makes his first appearance as bassist on this album, and does not fail to please, as he matches Nergal's intensity throughout the album. Then there is Inferno, one of the most gifted and fastest drummers you will hear. So much so, that Behemoth has had to endure some accusations that they actually utilized a drum machine in the recording of the album. Though not true, once you hear the sheer speed with which Inferno tears through the songs, you will understand why critics thought otherwise.    (b) Unlike many death metal albums, each song on \\"Demigod\\" is distinct. Despite being an enormous fan of extreme music, even I have to concede that there is some truth to the criticism that death metal albums consist of many songs that sound similar (to the point they could play as one long song if the pauses were omitted). With that being said, \\"Demigod\\" does not suffer from this fault. Rather, the structure for each song is unique, making each of the songs clearly distinguishable from one another. Furthermore, there are songs on \\"Demigod\\" that (dare I say it) are accessible and listener friendly! Make no mistake about it, Behemoth ranks as one of the most extreme metal acts (perhaps second only to Suffocation). Nonetheless, there are some catchy songs on the album (e.g., Demigod, Conquer All, and Slaves Shall Serve). Keep in mind I use the term accessible in the loosest sense, by no means do I feel that someone who is turned off by extreme music will find this album easy to listen to. But to death metal fans, this album will be a feast for the ears!    (c) This is far and away the most extreme, intense, and fastest album ever recorded (or I should say, that I have heard). From the opening song to the very last riff, \\"Demigod\\" unleashes an onslaught that NEVER lets up! Even the above mentioned band, the mighty Suffocation, have never released an album so insanely fast. Blast beats are plentiful throughout \\"Demigod.\\" However, unlike some albums where listeners find their excessive use to be boring and one-dimensional, the heavy reliance on blast beats only enhances this album. They add to the overall intensity, which will energize the listener, whipping him/her into a fury.    (d) The production of \\"Demigod\\" is FLAWLESS! This album is the most polished death metal album I have ever heard. All of the instruments shine through with a clarity that is crystal clear. Surprisingly, it is Nergal who produced the album, proving that his talents extend far beyond the stage and his instruments, into the studio as well.     Though \\"Demigod\\" is an outstanding album, no recording is without flaws, and \\"Demigod\\" is no different. Perhaps the only stylistic flaw that I found is the long instrumental introduction the album's final song \\"The Reign of Shemsu-Hor.\\" Time wise, this song clocks in at over 8 minutes, with the first 2 1/2 minutes being nothing but the aforementioned instrumental introduction. The intro is powerful; however, it is slow and fairly repetitive. I find myself fast forwarding through the intro or skipping this song all together. The first two minutes serve as somewhat of a lull in an otherwise perfect album.    My only other criticism comes from a personal standpoint that is completely unrelated to the music. Personally, I have never been one to enjoy lyrics that are pagan in nature. I wouldn't call \\"Demigod\\" a satanic album, but there are certainly references made to pagan gods as well as inspiration drawn from Alister Crowley. However, I knew of Behemoth's spiritual beliefs before purchasing the album, so by no means was I offended or taken aback, as a Christian its just not my style, but that is me, and by no means should this criticism be taken as a stab at a band as musically talented as Behemoth.    In short, as one other reviewer succinctly stated, \\"Behemoth are obviously the best at what they do\\" - I could not state it any better. \\"Demigod\\" seems to occupy the space in my CD player more so than any other album I own. I literally see myself eventually wearing this album out from repetitive play...it's that good! Anyone who is a true fan of death metal should do him/herself a favor and buy this album...you will not be disappointed. I can only wonder what Behemoth will do for their next release, as I don't see how it will be possible to top the masterpiece of \\"Demigod!\\"
B0007Y08I8|5.0|This is one of the stupidest funny movies out there.  When I say stupid funny for se \\"Kung Pow\\" not \\"Office Space\\" type funny.  The movie is a superficial political satire, no deep thoughts at all.  I can see that some of the far left might find it too harsh, since Matt and Trey did blow up their hero Michael Moore.  I am moderate left, myself.  Yup, America is an aggressor today, so were the British and French when they were superpower protecting their own financial interests.  History always repeats itself in different situations.  I thought it was great that they also made fun of actors and actresses, whom many never went to college, but seem to know more then everybody else in world politics and economics' working.<br /><br />Kim Jong Il should win the Oscar for male supporting cast; he is ridiculously hilarious, like 911x1,000 of Saddam Hussein in South Park the Movie.  The puppet acting is one of the best and facial definitions are done very well.  The scenes are done very well, but don't believe that the Eiffel Tower is next door to the Arc de Triomphe, etc.  The movie is actually quite short and moves very fast.<br /><br />There is no need to analyze the plot or storyline here, since it is for pure laughing entertainment.  No need to get all up tight here also.  Great for a rental and even good enough to own.
6305657947|5.0|What fabulous fun!  People over 40 in a stylish, entertaining, and intelligent film---that's a refreshing change of pace!  Two grownups playing \\"who's got the goods?\\" and it turns out, neither of them does.  Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo are terrific in this updated version of the Steve McQueen 60's film about high-end art theft and pursuit of the bad guy.  Twists and turns and Russo in a fantastic Michael Kors wardrobe, plus Brosnan funnier and sexier than ever, make this a smart film for actual grown persons.  Amazing!
B0001XAS1M|5.0|One can marvel at the lengths that Jim Steinman goes through on this release to throw everything in your face constantly. If one wants to learn his credo, turn to Bat Out Of Hell Part Two, check song title \\"everything louder than everything else.\\" That is pretty much his motto for life.  <br />Every song on here, except the ballads go completely and utterly over the top in every aspect. Even then, the ballads are smothered with strings wringing every drop of fake emotion Steinman, Loaf, and Rundgren can fool you into feeling. This is grand stupid entertainment even better than Andrew Lloyd Weber because it rocks ten thousand times harder when Steinman bothers to write rock. Because his ballads are typical \\"broadway\\" ballads; little melody or emotion, but lots of fakery.  <br />The longest songs are the best. Thanks Todd Rundgren for this album being good; Todd is a genius, and he helped reign in Steinman's completely excessive nature whenever he could, and make these songs somewhat paltable for a human being. Plus, he rips on guitar on every song when he's given a chance to. Bat out Of Hell, the song is amazing simply because of his guitar playing done in ONE take. Buy it and giggle along to the lyrics of \\"Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad.\\" Steinman would have wanted it that way.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The series is great, I never got to see it on TV so I only heard about it thru word of mouth.  Great acting, great story line, and wonderful chemistry amoung the actors.  It reminds me of the first season of Sliders or Farscape, gave me the feeling of knowing something great is in the works.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Siamese Dream had the unfortunate setback of being released at the same time that Nirvana were at the peak of their popularity, therefore everyone's attention was forcused on them. <br />If this album had come out a year before or a couple years after, I'm sure it would've rose to greater heights initially. <br />Of course, in hindsight, it's considered a masterpiece. And for good reason, this is one of the great rock albums of the 90's. <br />Instead, because Nirvana burnt out in 1994 (the band, not the popularity), 1996's Mellon Collie album got more attention and applause. However, Siamese is a far better album. The best Pumpkins album. It shows the huge talent of the musicians and the amazing talent of Billy Corgan's songwriting. An almost unbelievable step forward from their previous effort Gish.  <br />The opening track sets the perfect tune for the whole album. Great lyrics, lots of rolling drums and amazing guitar solo's. <br />In my opinion, this was the Pumpkins in their prime. Still enjoying what they're doing, they don't hate each other's guts yet, not all addicted to a bunch of drugs and before Corgan started singing through his nose. <br />The final track is the most beautiful on the album and a great mood setter for a dinner at home with you and a date. <br /> <br />5 stars!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The music is so bad that it ruins the series for me. That annoying guitar playing over every moment when there should be a powerful orchestra is not only annoying but begs the question... what kind of genius thinks this is good? <br /> <br />Whedon has a hardcore fanbase and if he is lucky then they will buy enough of this overblown bunk to allow him to make more crappy shows like Buffy and Angel. Oh, and this horrid mess. <br />---------------------------------------------------------------- <br />Wow! What a creep. Did you get your reaction?
B000002OMN|5.0|I mean...an EXPLICT sequel to one of the greatest selling albums of all time. Impossibly long running time, not only over all, but just the entire damn thing. It's almost impalaple on first listen. I Would Do Anything For Love is TWELVE minutes long! (bet you didn't learn that in music class?)And Todd Rundgren only plays guitar he does not arrange... uh oh. Steinman pushes everything to the point of excess every single chance he gets. not once does he ever show one single trace of good taste, as his arrangments are usually very busy, playing not so great melodies over top of meat loaf's technically demanding, but over emoting singing, to lyrics that make 12 year olds blush with their immaturity. The music is a mix of that FIRST album with slight nods to contemporary trends. This is a nightmare of an album that is absolutely a joy to listen to because of it. <br />It's like, this is the ultimate in excess trash. It's garbage, there's nothing here emotionally or musically. It's all derviative and technically should never have gained any popularity at all. <br />But the fun of the album is the complete trash nature of the album. And the fact that everybody knows it is. You can't convince me Steinman was insane enough to take \\"wasted youth\\" seriously; it's a joke. I believe the man is serious in what he is doing, but he also knows that there is an inherently ridiculously quality not only to his music but to rock and roll in general. <br />So, he pushes everything that is excess to the complete breaking point, breaking it constantly. He probably giggled his way through these sessions. And Meat Loaf no doubt did the same. Oh not to disparage him completely, the man has tons of talent. I mean, there is a lot of stuff going on in every one of these songs, and rarely rarely do they seem tossed together. He carefully crafts these songs, like a broadway tunesmith, hoping you'll all clap along and sing to his merry melodies. Love it, leave it, I don't care. I listen to it aboutonce a year and I still remember the songs. That's all one can ask for in trash entertainment, sometimes.
6301007875|4.0|Loosely based on a story that Steven King wrote under pseudonym, \\"Running Man\\" is a Schwarzenegger flick all the way.  It's got great action scenes, unforgettable one-liners and a villain you just love to hate.  Set in some near-future in which America is a police state addicted to TV, \\"Running\\" has our fave Governator playing Ben Richards, a lawman sent to prison for betraying the system.  (As a gunship pilot, he disobeys orders to wipe out a crowd of homeless vagrants; one of his co-pilots nabs command, follows orders, and then sticks Richards with the blame for wiping out the \\"innocents\\".)   <br /> <br />With the help of two prisoners, Richards escapes from a maximum security prison...only to get caught again.  This time, he's given a chance to win his freedom by playing \\"Running Man\\" - the police state's version of Gnarfeling the Gnarthog.  Hosted by Richard Dawson (wonderfully sending up \\"Family Feud\\") contestants for \\"Running Man\\" are trapped within an insidious obstacle course.  There they must outfight and outwit the show's real stars - flamboyant killers with chainsaws, flame-packs or thunderbolts.  Typically, \\"contestants\\" (condemned criminals for the most part) are lucky to survive even one brush with the stars - but then, none of them are played by the governor of the Great State of California.  Suffice it to say, our hero wins all, saves the planet, and gets the badguys good.  (Well, what were you expecting.)   <br /> <br />While it doesn't have the bite of \\"Series 7\\", this isn't meant to be a serious attack on \\"reality TV\\".  It's perfect popcorn fun that knows its action cues and delivers the goods.  Calling the movie \\"mindless\\" underrates the art of its comic-action timing.  Though not as imaginative as the Terminator movies (the first 2 anyway) or \\"Total Recall\\", it's still consistent fun. <br /> <br />WISH I SAID THAT: Richards gets schmoozed by a lawyer before signing away the contract (and his life) to enter the game.  The lawyer spouts out a longstream of Latin terminology that's just a bunch of legal terms strung together to fool the unschooled - res ipsa loquitor.  The point of Richard's reply is much clearer in contrast.

0345446798|2.0|I was hoping this would be a groundbreaking book.  It isn't.<br /><br />I've been objectively observing the shifting paradigms in the dog training world for nearly thirty years and I've found that there are two major myths out there: 1) that dogs form social hierarchies (they don't*, the pack instinct only exists to enable canines to hunt large prey), and 2) that behavioral science is a real science (it's not--even Keller Breland, after he'd invented clicker training, said \\"There are definite weaknesses in the theory underlying these techniques.\\").<br /><br />And while I'm sure McConnell believes in what she says, and that she's probably a pretty good trainer, in THE OTHER END OF THE LEASH she perpetuates both of these myths.  If she only understood that the prey drive is the organizing principle behind canine social behavior imagine how much better at it she'd be.  (I've used both dominance training and operant conditioning and found nothing works better than play training.)  So by all means read THE OTHER END OF THE LEASH to get McConnell's perspective, but keep what I've said in mind.  And I'd recommend that you also buy a copy of NATURAL DOG TRAINING or PLAYTRAINING YOUR DOG, by Patricia Gail Burnham.<br /><br />Still, it's very helpful to have someone with McConnell's background and experience telling dog owners that some of the things they instinctively and unconsciously do as human beings actually send the wrong signal to their dogs (even if McConnell does have a lot of those signals wrong herself).  That's why I'm giving THE OTHER END OF THE LEASH two stars.<br /><br />*Top wolf expert L. David Mech and his colleagues don't like to use the word alpha anymore because, \\"it falsely implies a hierarchy.\\" (Canadian Journal of Zoology, 2002.)

B000784WMW|4.0|This version, finally available on DVD, was to me the only version worth owning until the 2007 remake with Toby Stevens and Ruth Wilson was made and released. <br />This version is a bit slow-paced  and low budget, and didn't need to be as many hours long as it was, but at least no one can say it skipped over too much of the novel.  Once the Jane character meets up with the Rochester character, sparks fly,and it's a pleasure to watch Dalton and Clarke act.  She never oversteps the bounds of Victorian ladyhood but she is no doormat, and he is all but simmering with passion and unconventionality.  The price on this version has become so low, it would be silly not to own it if you are a \\"Jane Eyre\\" fan; <br />you'll find yourself replaying the later episodes over and over again.
8484502112|5.0|Hermann Hesse is a Swiss Nobelist. The story commences with<br /><br />conversations between Siddharta and Govinda who are friends.<br /><br />Siddharta grows to become a learned person amongst the Brahmins.<br /><br />The love of his parents, knowledge passed down from posterity and<br /><br />time in the local community are not enough for Siddharta. He routinely practices meditation near a banyan tree. Siddharta makes a pact to go into the forest. If he succeeds in finding bliss as a Samana, he will return to teach the experiences gained in absentia. If he becomes dis-illusioned, he will return to offer special sacrifices.<br /><br />Siddharta began his journey stripped of worldly possessions. He<br /><br />entered the forest with only a loin cloth and an unstitched cloak. He spent time fasting to become empty of thirst, desire,<br /><br />dreams, pleasure and sorrows. The experiential domain of this<br /><br />exercise was supposed to lead him to purity of mind and thought.<br /><br />Ultimately, Siddharta came to a realization that knowledge can be communicated but not wisdom.

The book provides an important lesson on Eastern philosophical and religious thought.<br /><br />The contents will be appreciated by philosophers, religionists<br /><br />and literary experts everywhere.
0156027321|5.0|This suspenseful and unique novel creates in the reader a genuine sense of doubt by the end. What REALLY happened during Pi's drifting at sea for months on end?  All of the things you THINK may have happened as you read will be turned on end during the last few critical pages of the book.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Several months after reading it, it STILL has me wondering.  That is the beauty of this book - - it stays with you for quite some time.<br /><br />It's a great read for book club discussions, that's for sure!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This is the compilation that I was waiting for and except for the fact that they had the live and not the studio version of \\"Big Love,\\" I don't have too many gripes about the selections and especially not about the sound quality which is very well remastered.  This is possibly THE Fleetwood Mac post-Peter Green era best of compilation to get.  They practically filled up all the available space both discs could hold and so there's no feeling of being short-changed here and the tracks are fairly representative of what they have done to date.
B00005V331|5.0|As many of already said, there isn't much that can be said that hasn't been said already.  Here we have it, one of the first in the first wave of black metal.  What can you expect from such an early black metal release you ask?  Well, minimal musicianship is a first.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad thing at all.  That is how birth is given to a great, new genre of music.  Think about punk music for a second.  The first punk wave didn't have the greatest of musicians or the best of equipment, but they did have something that very few bands had at the time of disco, they had heart.  With that something new is born and ready to influence for years and years to come.  Fast forward a few years to the birth of extreme metal.  Venom was right there with the best.  Sure they weren't the greatest of musicians, but they had an extreme statement that was almost unheard of.  They dared to be different.  Those that dare are the ones that have the greatest influence. <br /> <br />With all of that said, I must say that this is album is great fun.  As I said before, the musicianship isn't bad, just a little on the simplistic side of the spectrum.  It is still as powerful as can be.  You'll find everything here from blood curdling yells to evil whispers.  There are even guitar and bass solos.  It's hard to believe that there were only three guys in this band because they have quite a full sound.  Another thing I've noticed with Venom is the fact that every song is done fully.  What I mean with that is that every song has drama, especially the endings.  When it comes to writing, these guys never skipped out on anything or wrote filler.  That is nice to see in an album of any kind of genre of music.  With all of that said, I give this album five stars and I stand behind it fully and probably always will.  Highly recommended!
1881273989|4.0|Chapman has done an excellent job at coming down to the fundamentals of the ways people feel loved. The love languages he describes can be in any relationship, not just dating relationships, but the book focuses on these types of relationships. He gives EXCELLENT examples of people he has counseled regarding how to show interest and affection to the one they want to develop a deeper relationship with. The book help demystify and clarify some of the communication gaps that go on in relationships. It is an easy read, and a book that I highly recommend for people look to improve their relationships, platonic and beyond.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Short Story ahead! You've been warned :-)    So, I'm a musician (mainly guitarist and vocalist). I play in jam sessions, or as a street musician in the city or at parties, et cetera.    For years I was in the Prog/Metal world, a la: Pink Floyd, Queen, Queensrche, Metallica, Dream Theater, Apocalyptica, Iron Maiden.     Normally at those parties or street sessions I performed mainly popular tunes by the bands I just mentioned, like Nothing Else Matters (Metallica), Money (Pink Floyd), Bohemian Rhapsody (Queen), you get the idea.    But my repertoire would've been better if I just had some real mainstream songs in it. And now I'm not bashing mainstream or anything. I actually started becoming a musician because of Britney Spears back in 1999, I just stopped listening to pop ever since I started listening to Queen and Metallica (and all the other non-mainstream music).    But so, I thought: Britney Spears. Why not put her in my repertoire? I already know quite her music from her first album back in 1999, I thought.  So I checked this CD: In The Zone. To my surprise it's very different! Although (as quite many others mentioned) her voice seems to be more mature, it sounds as if she doesn't have that 'power' she had in her earlier music. I already heard both 'Me Against The Music' and the brilliant 'Toxic', but a song like \\"Breath On Me\\" is (to me) so fresh and new. I like this 'dance' music.  And \\"Brave New Girl\\"? 'What the heck is this?', I asked myself the first time I heard it. She sounds like Avril, no kidding!    Me Against The Music is worth mentioning as well. I saw the clip when it was aired for the first time here in Holland (yes, I did want to SEE Britney :-P), and the song is interesting in many ways. Rhytmically it's quite tough, especially the very fast \\"I'm up against the speaker, tryin' to take on the music It's like a competition, me against the beat. I wanna get in the zone, I wanna get in the zone.\\" and \\"If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm Tryin' to hit it, you could die, In a minute I'm a take a you on, I'm a take a you on\\" parts. And try to play the guitar part along with the singing (like I did), TOUGH TOUGH TOUGH.    Everytime is a beautiful song. And just because it's Britney people hate it (I'm talking about the non-Britney fans). It's quite like My Immortal at parts (though My Immortal is a KILLER SONG, I give you that). Of course, it could've have been stronger if a more skilled singer would sing it, but it's still a great song with Britney.    And my favourite track: Toxic!!!  It's perfect! I really like the \\"I'm addicted to you, don't you know that I'm toxic!\\" part. It's so catchy, the lyrics are deep and the \\"James Bond like\\" guitar in the background makes this a funky piece of music. I love the clip as well. The way she dancewalks in the apartement after having climbed the windows (you know the part where she's got that cape), it flows so well in the music.    Now I know Britney didn't write the songs (I mean musically, not lyrically), but so what? Elvis didn't write all of 'his' music, either.    She's a true performer, and that's what an artist is all about. So she may lip-sing her live shows, she for sure can dance. And all this bashing saying her singing is corrected in the studio is in many cases wrong. Yes, you can correct a wrong sung note, but you WILL notice it. She obviously (or maybe not) did many takes of a song and cut and paste the best parts, but many rock, metal and other pop bands all do that too. She did need to sing them in tune, though. It's not like that she could sing as out of tune as possible and let the computer does all the work, it doesn't work that way.   Yes, technically she doesn't really pop out, but she can sing.    Hmm, maybe I'm becoming a Britney fan, who knows. *checks 'Oops! I Did It Again' and 'Britney'*

B00005JMJG|5.0|Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind is, in my opinion, one of the most phenomenal romantic/comedic/dramatic films ever made.  Charlie Kaufman's script is captivating and inventive: few screenwriters have the talent (and even the courage) to create believeable characters and relationships in reverse.  Eternal Sunshine has every element I love in movies:  an amazing plot, superior acting and ingenious cinematography.  From an artistic standpoint, it's simply breathtaking.  I loved every minute of it.

0767834739|2.0|To say this movie was a good, successful one would in fact be a lie. In my opinion this was a terrible sequel to a movie that I adore. For starters, it is unrealistic in its approach to situations presented in the Resident Evil world, and by taking away Alice's feminine vulnerability it detracts from her character a heck of a lot. <br /> <br />The staged characters that are in the games are nothing like their counterparts. Jill, for one, does not do the character justice at all, nor does Carlos. And can I say that the other characters while at first seemed interesting, were killed off far too quickly to develop any emotional attachment to them. <br /> <br />The pace of the movie was too fast and it was not easy to catch on to what we are supposed to be seeing. Not only that, but every five seconds it seemd like there is a fight scene that has no purpose what-so-ever as opposed to the balanced feel of it's predecessor. <br /> <br />Overall I am very dissapointed with this title, and I would not recommend it at all!

B00005JMXX|5.0|The Day After Tomorrow... it is such a great movie, I must say. It depicts the effects of global warming on the polar icecaps to create an adverse affect across the globe. The changes noted are not positive, but rather factors that are detrimetnal to the chronocling of the events before the world reaches absolute zero. <br /> <br />The actors chosen for the roles did a great job of their parts, especially Austin Nichols. But I might be only saying that because I am a little biased an like him somewhat. Regardless, the emotion was correctly portrayed, and the characters quickly become ones that you can relate to. <br /> <br />The special effects are amazing in that they convey the true horrors of nature when the world goes awry. <br /> <br />Get this movie, before it gets you.
B00004SVIK|5.0|My review is solely to point out an error in Music Lover's (Spotlight Review). Where I actually agree with most everything said, I have one slight problem. At the end of the review it is said and I quote \\"Buy your copy, listen over and over, and keep hoping that Gilmour, Wright & Mason get together again for a new Pink Floyd album.\\" Correct me if i'm wrong but, this review is about The Wall, right? Is this album not from the psychotic genius that is Roger Waters? The Wall could not have came to be without Waters, period. I want a new album as much as any Floyd fan, but we need Waters back in the line where he deserves to be. And, as some might have seen on there reunion set at the Live 8, they can still play together. <br /> <br />P.S. The Album is Great. :)
B00005TT77|4.0|It was awesome hearing The Beatles songs in how the artists creatively sang it in their style. I think it's silly and obnoxious how many people disliked it JUST because it wasn't The Beatles, or because the style wasn't /copied/ the exact same way. <br /> <br />I think Eddie Vedder's voice was perfect for 'You've Got To Hide Your Love Way.' Aimee Mann and Michael Penn did a great job on 'Two of Us.'  <br /> <br />I actually loved Grandaddy's version of Revolution. I think people would've like it more if they knew it wasn't originally a slower song by The Beatles, but I have to admit I thought their version catchier than The Beatle's. Not that I think Grandaddy is superior, I'm actually listening to The Beatle's Revolution right now. <br /> <br />I did not like The Wallflowers' 'I'm Looking Through You' as much, but it was decent. Other good ones I thought were The Vine's 'I'm Only Sleeping' and Ben Folds' 'Golden Slumbers.' <br /> <br />There were a couple of bad ones of course, as you can tell from the other reviews.
B00005YUNY|5.0|This is, as many others have said and will continue to say, a terrific album and well worth the money. I get chills when I hear Alan playing innovative fills (for once) in Starship Trooper. Gates of Delirium just blows me away. I could probably watch this DVD 4 or 5 times without stopping. It's just that good. With that in mind, I'm going to pick out some of the details and blow them out of proportion for the sake of illumination. I'm an audiophile, so little things stand out to me. <br />1. Close to the Edge is my favorite song, but they need to put more energy into it; they keep slowing it down. This is mostly in the beginning, but later it gets better. <br />2. I do have a problem with the mixing. Although some people like it, Jon's voice is just too loud, and there needs to be more bass, keys, and symphony. After all, this is Yes Symphonic. <br />3. Owner of a Lonely Heart is the worst-performed song on there. The song is designed for a thick, aggressive sound (think House of Yes), and when you put Chris's square white bass (which is not adjusted well, sound-wise, as opposed to his Rickenbacker) in with, frankly, lazy guitar playing by Steve, along with keyboards that are half the volume they should be, or less, with Alan playing as tight-hattedly as possible, you end up with a very thin, weak sound. <br />4. There really needs to be more keyboard sound. Really. I know it's the third time I've mentioned it, but it's true. Guitar, vocals, and drums do NOT make up the entire group, they don't make up 80% of the group, they are 3 entities out of 5 (plus the orchestra). The other guys should have their say. After all, they're virtuosos, too. <br />5. I made a remark about Alan hardly ever playing innovative fills. I didn't really mean for that to sound negative or critical; it's more of a rejoicing that he put in something really cool rather than just supportive. I listen to a lot of Yes and I hear all sorts of places that he could just throw in a few beats of wildness and get away with it, but he very, very rarely does. Not a crack against his abilities (he's a friggin' genius), I just think he should break out of his box a little more. <br /> <br />As I said before, I'm making mountains out of molehills. This really is a great DVD and I would readily recommend it to anyone who likes Yes. Yes has always been an amazing band and they'll continue to be, if not in person then through their great legacy of recordings.
1400082773|3.0|In reading other reviewers' comments, I too feel as if the content of this memoir was different from what I had expected.   <br />I too felt that Obama's mother and maternal grandparents were kind of left out in the cold, although they were the ones who raised, nurtured, and loved him. <br />On the other hand, the book is mostly devoted to his father - a man who abandoned Obama - and his fathers side of the family. <br />I thought Obama was half white and half black, but after reading this book, I believe he is only black.
B00065MDRW|5.0|Some critics have made a compelling argument for 1969 being the greatest year in rock, with the last Beatles albums and the first Zeppelin Albums, and a whole lot in between this marked the end of era and the beginning of a new. This album was one of the landmarks in this amazing year, each track is different, and represent such different views they could be by differnt bands, but when you listen to this album, that isn't the feeling you get. Each track is individually crafted; from the unbelievably heavy 20th Century Schizoid Man (even the 2 great albums of Zeppelin didn't have a track that produces this amount of drive), through the wistful I Talk To The Wind on through the lyrical Epitaph, psychedelic Moonchild (Syd Barrett would have been proud!) and finally the Storytelling title track. This album after 30 years of listening still sends shivers down my spine, and is still one of my all time favourite albums! <br /> <br />Though never a big band, the band and it's members became pervasive through 70's, 80's and 90's rock. Pete Sinfield continued writing and went on to also produce. (including Roxy Music's 1st album, their 2nd, For Your Pleasure, being at least as good, if not better that Court!) Lake went off to ELP (some interesting but mostly very over blown prog/symphonic rock!) and Asia, whilst Fripp (one the greatest and innovative British guitarists ever) continued the band whilst also producing some amazing session work especially his work with Bowie and Eno. MacDonald played in many bands including being a cofounder of Foreigner! And of Giles who knows! <br /> <br />
0312983867|1.0|I have read the first eight Stephanie Plum novels ... and I loved every bit of them ... almost. Even though I am male, and the books' target audience is female, I found the first seven refreshing, hilarious, and full of appeal no matter what your gender. But in Hard Eight, Evanovich basically destroys her heroine's \\"likeability factor\\" -- big time -- by having Stephanie basically cheat on Morelli. Evanovich tries like hell to justify all of this ... but it rings hollow. I wonder if all of the female readers of this series would be so forgiving if it was Morelli cheating on Plum. The double standard is in full force here, and Evanovich just ruined a GREAT series by turning her heroine into a common slut, who cheats because she is motivated by nothing more than lust.
B000002LSV|3.0|I bought this CD before I went back to Georgia, and I have not<br /><br />listened to it yet! A friend of mine wanted me to listen to this<br /><br />the day before I went traveling.

B00092ZL80|5.0|I have seen Chicago live three times and never had seen Earth Wind and Fire. I can honestly say that this is the best concert I have ever seen. What a treasure to own.  I am so glad they decided to go on the road together.  Absolutely the Best!!!.
0670033375|1.0|In case you haven't figured it out yet, Jared Diamond does not, and never has, know what he is writing about. His facts are suspect, his opinions are worthless. His analysis equal a curious 9th grader. Not only does this book cover nothing new, it is endlessly boring and the topics are all re-hashes. You made your money Jared, now hang it up.
B00003CXRP|1.0|There. That pretty much sums it up.<br /><br />OK, I'll tell you a bit more. Tom Hanks is some work-obsessed jobsworth postal worker guy who MUST deliver all his packages in record time (clearly a work of complete fiction), and, oh-ho - in one of life's little ironies, he gets trapped on a desert island.<br /><br />Now, the thought of Tom Hanks running around in little more than a loin cloth for more than an hour wasn't exactly appealing to me either, but I stuck with it. I really wish I hadn't.<br /><br />The stuff on the island is decent enough, but then of course ol' Tom goes nuts. He finds a football washed up on shore and it becomes his best friend. He paints a face on it, gives it a name and has full blown conversations with it.<br /><br />But then, the really annoying part?  When he gets OFF the island, all traces, every single one, of madness are gone. He becomes a fully functioning human being again. So, er, what was the POINT OF THE WHOLE MOVIE THEN?????<br /><br />A waste of time. And not even a GOOD waste of time.<br /><br />The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.uk
B000002HEP|5.0|To be honest the only reason I bought this CD was because I have been tearing through everything even closely linked to QOTSA (Queens of the Stone Age) and had heard that Josh Homme had been a part of this band.  This CD was my first experience with Kyuss.  The first couple listens through I was not real impressed.  It was a little too heavy, a little to slow.... then I really listened to the second song on track 2, \\"Space Cadet.\\"  I couldn't get enough, I was humming and singing it to myself all thoughout the day, and couldn't wait to listen to it. <br /> <br />I of course started listening to the whole record more, and it spent a good two solid weeks as pretty much the only thing I listened to (until I got ....And the Circus Leaves Town, also by Kyuss).   <br /> <br />I love QOTSA, but I have found myself listening more and more to Kyuss then them.  I am no musician, but you can hear some influences of where QOTSA would go, but the music is definately different.  The biggest difference to me (other then the vocals) is the guitar.  Josh shows on these tracks what he can do.   <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend this CD if you are into Rock music, whether it be Stoner rock, metal, or what.  It is just good tunes.  It may take a while to sink in, but in my opinion it is worth it.
B00005JMR5|5.0|I remember watching this as a kid with my Dad!! It was inspirational in me travelling & being interested in foreign culture as I got older, & I guess it has just stuck with me over the years!! Even the scene with Lionel Ritchie's 'Say you Say me' playing in the background!! <br />I cannot believe this is not on DVD yet!!! Hopefully soon <br />

0399229191|5.0|This lovely little story incorporates many of the best things in children's literature.  It is educational (teaching animals and their sounds), it involves repetition of a key line (about how busy the spider is) and it even has a touch-and-feel aspect (the spider web is done in 3-D relief).  Highly recommended for the pre-reader set!
B00000DS4L|5.0|ok, first off, this album is amazing, and i highly recommend it. Now to clear up a few things about it. This album was not simply a moneymaking scheme of Ozzy's. At first he didn't want to release it because he felt it would be taken as such, but after talking to randy's wife, and in response to the plethora of fan letters, he decided to release it. Second, this album is dedicated to randy rhoads (obviously) and so only contains material with randy playing. Unfortunately, this collection is the entirety of live perfomances of randy's recorded with ozzy (legally), and that's why the tracklist is what it is. SO NO MORE COMPLAINING!
B00005JNJT|4.0|Batman Begins is the fifth live-action movie since 1989 to bear the name of the Caped Crusader, but it might as well be the first. So completely does writer-director Christopher Nolan reinvent, reimagine, and reinvigorate this franchise, you may well entirely forget about the campy casting (Clooney as Batman! Ah-nuld as Mr. Freeze!), leaden dialogue, and nonexist plotting that Joel Schumacher used to try to kill off the series in the 1990's. (And please, don't even get me started on the Batsuit nipples.) Nolan, the auteur behind Memento and Insomnia, likes his thrillers dark and twisted, and this one is no exception. The incredibly talented Christian Bale (American Psycho, The Machinist) is riveting as Gotham billionaire Bruce Wayne, whose anger over the murder of his parents leads him into an intense study of the nature of evil, and ultimately to his emergence as a cowled and caped vigilante. The film touches relevantly on both corporate corruption (Wayne Corp. is run by an ultrasleazy Rutger Hauer) and on post-9/11 urban fear. Images of derailing trains and clouds of poison gas enveloping Gotham will bring chills to anyone who has watched the news in the last four years (or been unfortunate enough to have lived it.) The supporting cast is full of heavy hitters in fine form - Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Ken Watanabe, a sweetly subdued Gary Oldman (as Jim Gordon), an Oscar-worthy Michael Caine (wonderful as wry, indispensable manservant Alfred) - but for me the real standout is Irish actor Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later, Cold Mountain) as the fiendish Dr. Jonathan Crane, who runs the local asylum; in his supervillain guise as the Scarecrow, he is truly the stuff of nightmares (and just one reason I have to warn you, DON'T bring the kiddies to this one!)
140003180X|5.0|Excellent book in this series. Makes a person want to visit Botswana.  Has interesting interpersonal problems.
B0006L16N8|4.0|The main criticism many reviewers were making about \\"A Rush of Blood To The Head\\", despite rave reviews, was that Martin and the band still sounded too mellow. Coldplay have taken those words to heart here in this most guitar-driven effort to date, \\"X&Y\\". The U2/Kraftwerk-esque crunches drive a number of songs including the raw opener \\"Square One\\", \\"Talk\\", \\"Low\\" and \\"Twisted Logic\\" forward, while 80's techno blends drive the impressive \\"White Shadows\\". \\"Fix You\\" takes off where \\"The Scientist\\" left off, reaching a climatic point with the gospel-esque vocals chiming, fading off with Martin vocalizing as though he's preaching to the choir, making it their most empowered ballad yet. And the \\"hidden\\" track \\"'Til Kingdom Come\\" makes a stunning closer to the record, acoustically-driven and one of Martin's more deeper writes. It's forgivable that Martin may come off as schmaltzy and soft on some latter tracks of the record, particularly \\"Swallowed In The Sea\\" and \\"The Hardest Part\\". The record is more slickly produced than their previous efforts, and we have seen Martin evolve a great deal in his personal life grappling with the issues of family with Gwyneth and his daughter Apple, along with dodging tabloids. Whoever rated this lower than \\"Parachutes\\" (The New York Times) have already discredited themselves here. The more sensible argument is whether \\"X&Y\\" is superior to \\"A Rush of Blood To The Head\\" or not. I believe \\"X&Y\\" tops both their previous efforts. Indeed there's still room for improvement (let's hope Martin is non-pretentious enough to keep the band together and give it another try) but, ideally, \\"Parachutes\\" was like the musical blueprint to the band, with \\"A Rush of Blood To The Head\\" musical architecture in the making, and \\"X&Y\\" putting soul into what they have built from scratch.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie, it looked good in the previews and everything, and the book is one of my favorites, so I was hoping it would be pretty good. And it was. However, I was still disappointed by it, because I think it could've been better. Some of the best parts of the book are cut out for the movie. <br /> <br />Anyway, if you've never read the book, go ahead and buy it. If you have read it, then you should rent this.
B00082IJ08|3.0|The single Feel Good Inc. was outstanding, so I decided to purchase this CD. I really disliked the CD at first, (it's nothing like the hit single,) but on a second listen, I discovered a few tracks I liked. On a 3rd listen, I found most of this CD to be great. The CD just kinda grows on you. You probably won't like the CD on a first listen, but give it some time, and you'll discover a great CD. There are a couple of filler tracks, such as songs like Last Living Souls, (which has no hook whatsoever,) Every Planet We Reach Is Dead, (which is just dull,) and O Green World, which turns into just a bunch of techno noise. Except for those tracks, (and a couple of other unmemorable ones,) this CD is great, and some of these tracks are excellent. The last 3 tracks seem to be telling a story, and are basically linked together, ending the CD on a very good note. Definitely a great, innovative CD, and probably not what you are expecting. (A couple more songs similar in style to Feel Good Inc. wouldn't have hurt, though.) I took a point off the score of this great CD because of a couple of annoying and filler tracks. But definitely worth it. You may not like it on your first listen, but give it a chance
B00005V9QJ|5.0|This is an outstanding CD. What a marvelous artist Sade is.   <br />She has power, sensitivity and grace on stage!  I highly recommend this collection of live songs.  The DVD sounds good too. <br /> <br />
B00005JMUA|5.0|More subdued, less bloody and with a personal approach to the storytelling, \\"Kill Bill: Volume 2\\" is an outstanding and highly respectable companion to the first installment, \\"Kill Bill, Volume 1\\" that for me is a true and original classic. But with that said, \\"Kill Bill: Volume 2,\\" is a classic in its own right. It's a continuing story shown and told from a different viewpoint. In addition, the movie is effectively played out with imagination, visionary genius and amazing performances.<br /><br />\\"The Bride\\" (Uma Thurman) hunts down the last three on her to-do-list, Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Bill (David Carradine), the man whose face and voice is a permanent reminder of her past, present and potential future.<br /><br />\\"In Kill Bill: Volume 2,\\" we're introduced to Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) a master of the martial arts, a man of wisdom, power and the only one who knows the secret of successfully carrying out the \\"5 point palm exploding heart technique\\" and the one who trained Beatrix Kiddo before she became \\"The Bride.\\"<br /><br />Although Budd, Elle and Bill want \\"The Bride\\" dead, they all have a deep-rooted respect, and for Bill, it's about the love he lost. If \\"The Bride\\" is going out, she's going out in fashion. For \\"The Bride\\" is the world's best assassin and her title should be a reflection of how her death is going to be played out, by whomever lays claim to her demise.<br /><br />Did \\"The Bride\\" kill Bill and what ending manifested itself through all the horrid and hellish violence and deceit? You'll find out in Quentin Tarantino's illustrious homage to martial arts and the continuing quest of one woman's mission to seek revenge on those who did her so very, very wrong. \\"Kill Bill: Volume 2\\" will leave you with the insight of how it began and why it ended the way it did. Although, with that said, my only gripe would have to be with the ending. With such a monster house of originality and creativity, it just looked too weak for me to become inspired by it.<br /><br />Still eluding psychotic charm, and a heating-em-up, sizzle brain of freakiness was Daryl Hannah's character Elle Driver. She's so hypnotic to watch, I just can't seem to find myself resisting her evil tendencies and oddness. Like the original, there were many poignant, articulately choreographed scenes and memorable characters. Gordon Liu is another, with his character of Pai Mei just reeking in flamboyant campy humor and stylish personality.<br /><br />DVD extras include deleted scene, a behind-the-scenes look at the making of \\"Kill Bill: Volume 2\\" featuring Quentin Tarantino, \\"Kill Bill: Volume 2\\" premiere Chingon performance (which was fantastic!), Widescreen (2.35:1) -enhanced for 16x9 televisions, Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, DTS 5.1 digital surround sound, French language track, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />\\"Kill Bill: Volume 2\\" is tireless with its absorbing characters, fascinating dialogue, brilliant music, masterful directing and story telling.ak for me to become inspired by it.  <br /> <br />Still eluding psychotic charm, and a heating-em-up, sizzle brain of freakiness was Daryl Hannah's character Elle Driver.

B00005JMXX|3.0|What would happen if all the things we've done to our environment came back to haunt us? This is the scenario in \\"The Day After Tomorrow,\\" when the earth finally gives up on human civilization with the melting of the polar ice caps, a result of years of global warming. The lack of saltwater, after the melting, causes a chain of catastrophic weather events including tornadoes in Los Angeles, flooding in New York and an aproaching Ice Age for the entire northern hemisphere.<br /><br />Who can save the day? Dennis Quaid plays Professor Hill, a climatologist employed by the U.S. government. He has been predicting such chaos for a while now, to the doubts of the President and his cabinet. He must now convince the U.S. government to evacuate every citizen in the southern United States to safe Mexico. Unfortunately, those in the northern United States cannot be saved, as the paralyzing cold creeps quickly in their direction.<br /><br />Also, Professor Hill's son is trapped in New York and will die a freezing death in a short matter of time if he is not saved. Can Professor Hill convince the President to save as many Americans as possible by evacuating? Can he reach his son in time? Can human life survive another Ice Age - one that they created? Watch \\"The Day After Tomorrow,\\" with its amazing special effects and scary, \\"this could really happen\\" feeling to see if we still have a chance.<br /><br />The Day After Tomorrow is a good special effect movie but its plot far away excelent. Still it is worth of watching.
0671027573|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and finished it in one day.  I only gave it 4 stars however because it wasn't the best book I ever ready.  I thought the relationship between Sam & Jaine was too rushed but I kept an open mind that it was love at 2 weeks sight but marriage within a week of knowing one another was pushing it a bit.  I thought the book was very funny and I loved the signs at the elevators in the morning but I don't think she needed to go into detail of how funny things were (holding their sides, tears running, falling out of chairs), it kind of took away from my inital laugh because it wasn't THAT funny.  I liked the Corin character, although I guessed very early on who the killer was.  It really was a very good read and the 2nd Linda Howard book I have read,  you just have to keep an open mind.  As for the \\"potty mouths\\" and sex scenes that some people mentioned...I had no problem with it.  Let's face it, when women get together, especially at a bar, sometimes things go down that path and it is fun.  As for the cursing, well, some of us do it and it dosen't make us bad people, at least Jaine was trying to stop.
B000000OSE|5.0|It's been 10 years since I pulled out my GNR CDs and seriously listened to them. In high school, I loved Use Your Illusion II and my friend and I would debate which was better: Civil War or Estranged. A stupid kid who tried to be a bully and a friend at the same time came up to me one day and started reciting the last monologue in Coma, possibly to impress me. Surprised was he to find this dork singing right along with him!<br /><br />10 Years After, and awakened by the real world and how accursed it all is, I've come to find the Use Your Illusion albums more than enjoyable tunes to memorize. These songs have angst, anger, and a sort of jaded \\"experienced life\\" maturity to it that I find reminiscent of my current days.<br /><br />Use Your Illusion I has come to my aid and I've found myself listening to this record more and more. I've also realized that this record is Izzy's show. He pens eight of the sixteen tracks here (excluding most lyrics). From the darkest piano chord that opens Dust N Bones to the bizarre but awesome Double Talkin' Jive, Izzy's contributions on this record are vast.<br /><br />Rose's piano charms even the hardest rocking of songs, and his wordsmithing is both prolific and profound. Even if I loathed GNR, I'd have to admit Axl can express himself better than most. Besides Dead Horse, his only solo composition is November Rain, a song I used to idly listen to. It, along with UYI II's Estranged, is a work of genius. I can easily imagine Rose sitting at a piano, a drink on the music desk, creating the song; November Rain (as with most of these tracks) is best appreciated with good headphones.<br /><br />Where I used to skip over many of the tracks, today I listen to this album straight through. Although I don't consider the UYI albums concept in any form, UYI I feels faster, edgier, and more experimental of the two.<br /><br />To be quite honest, I never even knew people considered songs \\"filler\\" until coming here. So the idea really means nothing to me. These people worked hard on each song, and the result is an album unrivaled by anything released today.song, and the result is an album unrivaled by anything released today.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This is such a fun album to listen to! I absolutely love it. If you are a fan of bands like Trivium and Killswitch Engage, then you will enjoy this. The first track \\"The Beast and the Harlot\\" has such a great sound quality to it, and you can't help but fell the groove with the main riff. This continues throughout the entire album, and the guitar solo's scream! You must buy this record, it must be in your collection, you will not regret it! Great fun, great album, avenged sevenfold, buy it NOW!!!!!
B0000000LI|5.0|I never thought my love for music would extend to Yanni.  I purchased this album back in high school (10 years ago or so), covertly, and without mentioning it to my friends.  Sure enough, it was a beautiful record but I didn't appreciate it for what it was.<br /><br />Now, as I've found my part of the world to be a raucous, traffic-ingested sort, I can find peace in Yanni's Live at the Acropolis.  Even his most invigorating tunes are like listening to a combination of classical music and the better of Hollywood scores...but his music is still a genre on its own.<br /><br />The piano is beautifully played, my favorite instrument to listen to (with accompaniment); the orchestra is molded perfectly to his music and the very subtle keyboard effects (e.g. haunting ambient choirs in \\"Until the Last Moment\\" or string pizzicato in \\"Standing in Motion\\") work wonders to add atmosphere.  I actually don't know Yanni's other music, so I don't know if he uses orchestras otherwise, but credit must go to his three orchestrators, Shardad Rohani, Jeffrey Silverman, and John Rinehimer for exceptional work.<br /><br />This record is so meticulously handled, it blows me away.  The Acropolis's ambience is preserved; the audience's applause sounds like rain, as it would if you were watching a tasteful theatrical presentation.  They did well to remove loud whistles (which can be heard only if the listener is trying) and other distractions.  The applause after certain solos is gently brought into the piece keeping that \\"live\\" feeling throughout.<br /><br />The on-site recording and engineering is top-notch, and Yanni himself mixed the final product, keeping the levels respectable.  For example, when Yanni talks (which is rare), his voice sounds like an instrument and is subdued, quiet like the soothing voice in a planetarium, and does not jar the listener from the flow of the music.<br /><br />The shimmering percussion ranges from heart-thumping drums that reverberate through your speakers to light windchimes and hi-hat brush-strokes that are not drowned out by vibrato strings or pulsating rock basses.  Every instrument has its place, and every instrument is heard.  Exceptional mastering on Chris Bellman's part as well.<br /><br />The record is atmospheric.  I have a difficult time describing it as anything else.  The \\"live\\" part could have become a hindrance to the music, but it is handled so well, I hope it doesn't become a deterrent to possible purchasers; the album is a wonder to listen to.okes that are not drowned out by vibrato strings or pulsating rock basses.

B0009IW88A|4.0|I love film music, and the music in Batman Begins is no exception.  Like so many, I was curious as to what Messers. Zimmer and Newton Howard could do that would top Danny Elfman's iconic 1989 score.  And yes, like many before me have stated, they have instead crafted a score that complements the movie and is enjoyable on it's own .. and is as vastly different from the '89 score and this movie is from the '89 movie.  It's haunting, beautiful and at times downright scary .. and I've listened to it so many times now I've lost count.
B000274THQ|4.0|Since I was born and raised in Berlin, Germany I really liked the movie, because it showed my hometown during the fall of the wall. I didn't need the sub-titles, but they were sufficiant for non-Germans to understand the story line. The story was really funny, but it did have nudety in it which, since Americans are not used to it, could be too much. I am glad that I did buy the movie.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|I love Duran Duran and have for since '84 when I was a mere teenybopper. This album is certainly one of their best and a classic, truly timeless. Includes my fave song of all time, the beautiful ballad \\"Save A Prayer\\". <br />DURAN DURAN ROCKS PLANET EARTH! <br />*Bonnie Elliott*    <br /> <br />[...]
B00005JNTX|5.0|I had the opportunity to see this film in the theater and recommend the DVD transfer. SIN CITY packs plenty in the way of the five-knuckled fist of f@ck, fight, fury, fatalism and fun. What more could you ask for? Throw in the visual intensity of characters like Mickey Rourke and \\"Yellow Bastard\\" (whose shine is so intense against the pulpy black and white storyboard you want to scratch and sniff the screen for sulphur) and you have one helluva ride.<br /><br />Easily one of the most visceral films since CITY OF GOD. Highly recommended. If there was a sixth star to add in the rating system, I would have added a seventh.
B00005JNSK|4.0|I ducked into a matinee showing of this film yesterday primarily to get out of the oppressive heat and humidity.  Now it was kinda sorta on my list anyway.  I do like Tim Burton, at least the Tim Burton films that I've seen, and I do like Johnny Depp in most things I've seen him in.  And I read enough Roald Dahl back in the day to know that this would likely be as dark a children's film as you were going to get.  So if it couldn't be said I was desperate to see the film, I was certainly intrigued.    Almost as soon as the movie began, I remembered the key reason why it's always a good idea to try to catch Burton's films on the big screen.  The look of them is always impressive--grandiose actually.  And whether you're talking Willy Wonka's factory or Gotham City, you really want the full effect of those visuals.  They remind you of why it's such a shame that the word \\"awesome\\" has been cheapened in recent years and now just means something like \\"really cool.\\"    But there's still \\"awe inspiring\\" and Burton's visual sense is certainly that.  The initial scenes of Charlie's crooked, dilapidated house and the huge city that surrounds it are as Dahl-esque as you can hope for.  They're almost DALI-esque, in fact.  You almost wonder why such well regarded actors as Helena Bonham Carter, David Kelly and Noah Taylor would be so eager to take roles in a project in which they would be playing second fiddle to the special effects.  For his part, however, it's easy to see why Johnny Depp would be drawn to the Willy Wonka role.  One of our quirkiest actors reteaming with the quirkiest of directors, well, it's almost a sure thing.    Depp, we read time and time again, loves to take chances.  I'm sure he and Burton realized that by playing Wonka so affectlessly, they couldn't help but draw the Michael Jackson comparisons.  \\"Creepy\\" may be rapidly becoming an overused adjective in describing his performance here, but there you are. It's hard to think of a better one (except maybe \\"eerie\\").  If Depp and Burton didn't set out to evoke Jackson, then current events have overtaken their intentions.  But I suspect they did model some of Willy's vocal mannerisms on the Gloved One.  The paleness, the hair-do, and yes, the gloves also evoke Jackson as well. The key question is just how far along in development was this film when the most recent Jackson case broke.      The parallels are certainly there.  But there are key differencews. In the world of cinema, someone who lost his childhood,and who has never experienced the warmth of a loving family, can successfully become whole even in his (supposed) adulthood.  In real life, that's not so easy.    And there are other key differences between the fictional Wonka and what we know of the real-life Jackson.  Wonka's lack of solicitousness towards children is almost jarring, particularly if you're new to the story.  He does not seem eager to win their affection: in fact, he seems to be almost deliberately alienating. The harm he incurs on them is viewed as being somehow justified.  He is, in some ways, something of an avenging angel, giving these brats and their awful parents a well deserved comeuppance.      Interestingly, he is not much warmer towards the deserving Charlie until the very end either.  If he's aware of Charlie's specialness, he is not quick to let on.  It is more likely that h fundamentally misreads Charlie and cannot begin to comprehend the latter's love of family. It all leads to an emotional reawakening on his part, at Charlie's instruction. Child is mentor to the man, as it were.    Since I did see the movie at a matinee screening, there were a lot of kids in the audience.  One thing I did not sense was any giddy excitement on their part over what they had seen.  It's only a random sample, to be sure, but I couldn't help but wonder.  Is Burton's vision too dark for the kiddies?  Is there any real demographic for this film other than dyed-in-the-wool Tim Burton fans?  I'm not sure.  I had a few queasy moments viewing this film--you know, the sense of having eaten too much ice cream.     Or chocolate.
B000002VMH|5.0|A classic album that holds up very well over the years, Annie Lennox's Diva is perhaps the perfect pop/rock album.  The joyful up-tempo numbers balance the weighty and sorrowful ballads.<br /><br />Much of the lyrics reflect difficulties in her own personal life, but I don't think that Diva is truly that autobiographical or confessional.  She assumes the role of characters in her songs, and wears their hearts on the sleeve.  Lennox has an amazing ability to express a wide variety of emotional responses without flinching or sounding preachy.<br /><br />Walking on Broken Glass is a fun kiss-off record that still is played frequently on the radio.  Little Bird should have been a much more successful single, rather punchy and dramatic with a great sense of humor.  And Why is simply the most accomplished song ever about the dissolution of a relationship.  The non-single album tracks are all equally first rate.

B00004VWA7|5.0|Jaco's first solo record proves to be the most important and influential recording in the history of the electric bass.  I invite listeners from all other forms of music to try and find another bass player other than old jazz cats like Charles Mingus and Scott LaFaro who did more for the bass than Jaco has.  He single-handedly showed us new directions we could take the instrument in.  Modern players like Victor Wooten, Marcus Miller, Flea, and Les Claypool owe an immense debt to Jaco Pastorius.  This record holds even more weight, because it was recorded all the way back in 1976.  Jaco totally revolutionized the electric bass. <br /> <br />'Donna Lee,' an arrangement of a Miles Davis song, is just about the closest you could get to a bassist who 'shreds' in the style of monster guitarists like Malmsteen and Vai.  Every note is played clean and clear - Pastorius is a perfectionist and he makes no mistakes on this opening piece.  This is followed by the only track with vocals, 'Come On, Come Over.'  It features Sam and Dave on vocals, and I predict that one day Quentin Tarantino will use it in one of his movies. <br /> <br />Pastorius shows his versatility through his mastering of natural harmonics on the sublime 'Portrait of Tracy.'  He also shows his versatility in playing slow using plenty of vibrato and slides in other tracks like 'Ocus Pocus' and 'Continuum.'  Keep your ears open for elements that would sprout up in all forms of music from Rock to Rap to Hip-Hop to Country following this debute record.   <br /> <br />In my opinion, the true highlight of this record is 'Used to be a Cha-Cha' which is another arrangment of Charlie Parker's 'Ah Leu Cha' which is also covered by Miles Davis on his ROUND BOUT MIDNIGHT lp.  The track features Herbie Hancock and is a fusion barnburner full of solos from Hubert Laws, Hancock, and an hypnotic looping bass line from Jaco.  The alternate take bonus track on this edition is a gem, with Hancock shining even more.   <br /> <br/>Listen to what I have to say about Pastorius and this record.  If you don't believe me then look no further than Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, and Randy & Michael Brecker, all of which are featured on this pioneering release.  If you are a bass player, or simply call yourself a fan of the instrument, then anything Jaco has ever done belongs in your collection, including his solo material, his work with Pat Metheny, and his late involvment with the fusion supergroup, Weather Report. <br />
0385507755|4.0|I was so relieved when I came across this book. 4 moths ago I attended the same treatmet facility as Frey in Minnesota.  This institution is, perhaps, the devil.  The reason this book is important is that it familiarizes people with 12 step recovery treatment, a treatment backed by medical professionals, and this 12 step treatment philosophy for me, Frey, and many other intellectually sound people, is the largest roadblock to stayinng sober.  12 step recovery may work for some, but when it is touted as the only way, people who are unable to accept its illegitimate claims will lose, and do so feeling ashamed - ashamed that they couldnt just believe in this system, however wrong it may be.  Its tragic. Its the institution. its our failure to understand the actual mechanics of alcohol abuse.  You will hear that 12 step recovery is a simple program for complex people. An alteration: 12 Step recovery is a simple program for simple people.  I am angry, so angry.
B000005JA8|1.0|In my honest opinion this is the most unlistenable album I've ever heard and it resembles music only to the extent that a 4-year old's crayon scribblings resemble fine art. Taken in the context of the period of its release it seems to be about nothing other than 'shocking the straights'. Call me square if you want but the ability to make weird noises with musical instruments does not a genius make.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, if you're a fan of Frank Zappa you may find this right up your alley. <br /> <br />
B00005JLEU|5.0|Wow---689 reviews --what needs said has BEEN said. This movie changed everything -- Anime is NOT a collection of cartoons for kids and geeks, it is something amazing, something more, that can be expressed in no other way. This movie changed everything and Miyazaki changed my views on animated features (for which I am thankful). Read the other nearly 700-plus for details, read this one for pespective. Wonderful -- if not slightly too short, who could want this to end!?
B00004T9UF|5.0|Track 16 the song (Kim) has to be the one that people found the most disturbing to hear Eminem does nothing but talk during that hole song about he found a man with his wife sleeping together he beat him up and drag Kim in the trunk of his car drove off into somewear out in the middle of know wear wear it's just trees thats when Eminem took her out she started running he grab her then stab and killed her. On some of his other songs I love it when he talks about faggets.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|For one, it is Stephen Chow's best movie hands down -- Shaolin Soccer & God of Cookery while fun, can NOT hold a candle. <br /> <br />The worlds second best assassins are *the* highlight of the movie. <br /> <br />The end \\"boss battle\\" is unlike any other.  <br /> <br />I do NOT post unless I feel a strong hate or a strong appreciation for this movie -- and this one simply floored me. If you are bored with hollywood brain drains, and if you don't take yourself seriously, this moving will without a doubt be for you. For those of you with who do take yourself seriously, or prefer movies to be \\"by the numbers\\", please search elsewhere. Stephen Chow both cinimatically and by the messages he hopes to convey has made a huge impact on my life. This movie has truly earned the 5 stars given!
B00008N6N5|5.0|Larry Flynt creat the adult magazines back in the 70's he went to court for it he made a good point by saying (if a kid has a beer in his hand the law will not stop selling alochol in stores) but they want to band his sex magazines. In the 1983 he stop using dope but his girlfriend continue to use drugs. Larry got shot by a sniper that made him be in a wheel chair. What was funny in this movie is when Larry kept going to court the spited water at the judge, he use the American flag and wore it as a diper the judge found him guilty for discretion of the U.S. flag, he wouldn't let his lawyer talk, when people held him back and cover his mouth the judge ask \\"are you willing to listen\\" he said yes so they let him go thats when Larry threw a orange at the judge, Larry Flynt also wore a shirt saying \\"f**k this court\\".
006054094X|4.0|Among other books on the early Chinese treasure fleets of exploration, this book has the most facinating narrative.  The author anchors his finding in the historical setting of China of the Ming dynasty.  His use of maps that have survived in Europe and his claims that the information on them must have come from Chinese sources are a bold claims.  The author's conclusions, if accurate, give an entirely new view of global \\"discoveries\\" and raise the question of how different global history might have been had China not subsequently isolated itself.  Menzies' conclusions need critical review by other historians.
B000000OSE|5.0|Listening to this album (and its sister album, UYI2) was kind of like putting together a puzzle... it took MANY listens,and each time a new piece fell into place. At first, I thought both discs were too long, and had too much filler, yet there was to much musical gold to simply say the albums should be combined into a 'Super Illusion.' Now that I actually see the concept underlying this album, which is ENTIRELY DIFFERENT from UYI2's concept, I can firmly say every track on this album, while not excellent, belongs where it is. To those who just find this album 'ok,' I simply say it takes several listens. Now onto the story of this album - check the title of the review:    'Right Next Door to Hell' is an awesome opener, which goes on for just long enough without getting old. Now, listen to the first verse, and then combine it with the message in the next rack, Dust & Bones. That then goes to the cover, live and Let Die, and then Don't Cry. Notice how the lyrics in Don't Cry are empathetic and reassuring - 'I've beent here before.' That becomes important on the next album. These first four tracks create one of hte most solid openings in hard rock ever, and sets up the concept - one can almost see all these songs being sung by one fictional character (Axl doesn't count), which is especially genius because G'n'R didn't wirte track three.    The next phase of the album is the hardest - I don't feel \\"Perfect Crime\\" covers any ground that \\"Right Next Door\\" and the first half of \\"Appetite\\" didn't... thank god it's short. \\"You Ain't the First\\" is alright, and stands out as the only track on all three albums not in 4/4 time... Izzy's so proud that he starts off counting it out. It then goes to Bad Obsession, which seems like a re-hash of Mr. Brownstone, sharing the same weakness as \\"Perfect Crime,\\" but this song also has a conceptual significance to be revealed soon. \\"Back Off Bitch\\" is just fun... Then, \\"Double Talkin' Jive\\"...this one really grew on me - someone described itas a Metallica rip-off... um, no. It is pretty funny that they put a song with a line like \\"I got no more patience... man\\" right before \\"November Rain,\\" with its message of 'it'll all be ok... just hold on.'    Which brings us to the pinnacle of western music... November Rain. The album's greatest strength and weakness... because I always want to listen to it twice. Eighteen minutes later... who wants to finish the album? Seriously, the progression of November Rain, from that keyboard buildup, to Slash joining the song 4 MINUTES INTO IT, to that final chorus and then the metal-ish outro and the whole band chanting \\"you're not the only one\\"... goosebumps.    So then it's time to put the CD away and finish it tomorrow. You do... \\"The Garden\\" is trippy and reminds u that a song like this could not have been possible if John Lennon hadn't existed and wasn't the stoner he was. \\"Garden of Eden,\\" again with those really short songs with brilliant lyrics that can't be understood... I think the fact that they put both 'Garden' songs next to each other, and that the band littered the album with biblical references - being next to hell, being dust and bones, and 'lost in the garden of Eden' was done on purpose - it's all buildup to a man with a crappy life dying.     The last four songs, like the first four, really underline the story of 'Life's a Bitch, then you die' Notice how there's sixteen tracks, and 'Back Off Bitch' is right in the middle? Anyway, \\"Don't Damn Me\\" has some of the most important lyrics, like 'So I step into your world,' 'it's all a part of me' and 'silence isn't golden.' This whole song foreshadows the concept of the next album. Then, \\"Bad Apples\\"... I really don't like it very much. The 'death' concept is beaten into our heads as Axl beats a Dead Horse on the next track, along with one of Slash's best solos. Then...    ...it all comes together with \\"Coma.\\" Maybe Guns & Roses was really unimaginative and wrote about the same things... but isn't it more fun to think they tell a story? That chick he had a Bad obsession with can be heard yelling 'all you think of is sex, sex, sex,' the cover song is fullfilled, as he has lived and is letting himself die... 'his world' is waiting on the other side, which is exactly what UYI2 is about. Awesome.    Oh yeah, and the solos are great, Sorum's better than Adler, theproductions good, Axl rocks and all the other things every other reviewer's already told you about.

B00005BL2A|2.0|\\"Exciter\\" is anything but.<br /><br />Who can forget the roaring, raucous, rafter-thumping nightclub at 3 AM madness of eighties Depeche Mode, Depeche Mode in their raunchy monster glory days, the entire gothic playbook of \\"Some Great Reward\\" and \\"People are People\\" rattling the windowpanes of buildings blocks away while the floor writhed and steamed with flesh, and sweat, and attitude.<br /><br />Well, pack it up, gang.

Don't listen to this infernal sleep-inducing thing in the car: I did so, unwisely, nodded off and nearly wrecked three times, and that was just during the first minutes of \\"Dream On\\".<br /><br />And that's pretty much \\"Exciter\\": one slow, meandering, whiney, sleepy song after another, which croak and wheeze and wheedle along until they just end.<br /><br />I even played a few prime cuts off \\"Exciter\\" to grandma, and she smiled and said \\"what nice young men---do they cover Barry Manilow?\\".

B00029LNHS|4.0|I realy enjoyed this CD, but know what I was getting because I had heard most of the songs on the radio prior to puchasing this CD.
0393317552|2.0|The book is best at illustrating the difference between the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize.  The author is a physiology professor at a medical school--essentially an amateur popular science writer.  Each chapter is an historical and scientific gloss by someone with only an interested amateur's depth of knowledge about history and science.  The chapters are disconnected essays, weakly attempting to explain why world culture and human history were predetermined without being racist or otherwise politically incorrect.
B0009K7ROI|4.0|John Mayall has issued yet another new album? It amazes me that he has so much music in him that he continues to put out one quality album after another. Out of all he's done, there are very few Mayall albums I consider unworthy of his talent. <br />Road Dogs continues the long string of worthwhile albums that began when Mayall brought Coco Montoya and Buddy Whittington into the band nearly two decades ago after he suffered a patch of mid-career burnout by issuing a couple of uninspired records. Chicago Line revitalized his muse and he's been going strong ever since. Montoya has since gone out on his own, but Whittington more than makes up for his absence. <br />Mayall has a tendency to revisit favorite themes such as how the blues have affected his life, personal issues, and social ills yet he continues to exhibit a bouyant optimism in most of his lyrics. <br />On Road Dogs, he manages to cover all his favorite bases once again. My favorites here are the title cut, So Glad, Snake Eye, Beyond Control, Chaos In The Neighborhood, You'll Survive, With You, the instrumental Brumwell's Beat, and Scrambling. Mayall's voice, an acquired taste for some, is the same as ever, and the band's line-up gives musical force to Mayall's continued strong songwriting skills. <br />Throughout his career, Mayall's bands have showcased and nurtured up and coming young musicians, a huge number of whom have gone onto substantial popularity after graduating from Mayall's \\"school\\". The latest talent featured by Mayall is the very young Eric Steckel who plays a mean and fiery lead on the hard-hitting Chaos In the Neighborhood. He sounds great and I hope Mayall uses him again. <br />Long-time Mayall fans will be pleased to find the grand old man of British blues still crankin'. Though Road Dogs is not his best album, it is of a quality that will give it heavy rotation in my CD player both at home and on the road. Add it to your CD collection today.
B00005AR3G|5.0|This DVD is amazingly funny and entertaining. It is a DVD for all ages. My whole family enjoys watching it all the time,and at the end, the message of friendship is definetely what the family enjoys seeing. <br />The actors and artists have certainly merged all aspects to create a wonderful cartoon. <br />I highly recommend it and hope you enjoy it as much as we do. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B000065LZE|5.0|Radio saturation of nearly every track on this record may jade some listeners into underappreciating just what a landmark album \\"IV\\" actually was. After getting the somber, acoustic vibe out of their system on the last album it was all systems go for the Page/Plant tandem, and what a one-two punch this one starts out with. \\"Black Dog\\" practically invented Whitesnake's entire oeuvre with it's demonic boogie riff and Plant's piercing shrieks, sex, violence and all manner of ritualistic hedonism smelted together into a cast iron monolith to perfection. Before \\"Rock and Roll\\" was relegated to automobile spots it put forth the notion: \\"what if crack had been invented back in Jerry Lee Lewis' heyday\\"? The fact that such an irrepressible hallelujah (you can't tell me this song isn't a spiritual experience) was created out of fairly sober minds (ok, there was the coke) is a tribute of the love for the genre these British lads proffered back in the day.  <br /> <br />Proving \\"III\\" wasn't a fluke or botched experiment, \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" and \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" close out side one with ponderous odes to the band's Celtic heritage (the former) and God only knows (the latter). Lyrically \\"Evermore\\" is most akin to \\"The Immigrant Song\\", a Viking paeon from \\"III\\" that also ripped the paint off the walls, whereas \\"Evermore\\" is a gentler exploration of ancient British epic tales. On the other hand, scholars will be debating for centuries on the precise meaning of \\"Stairway\\" (I'd be satisfied with just narrowing down that \\"bustle in your hedgerow\\" business) but what is absolutely incontrovertible is it's significance in rock history, it's eternal place on \\"all time top 10\\" lists, and it's banishment from the ambience of guitar shops.  <br /> <br />We're back in business on side two, opening with the breezy jam \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", another flowers-in-their-hair anthem to unrestrained pleasure gratification. \\"Four Sticks\\" is another solid mid-tempo rocker showcasing Bonham's mastery of the skins while \\"Going to California\\" is an acoustic ballad which would also fit right at home on \\"III\\". Finally, Zep wrap it up with possibly the finest song on the album - and certainly one of the best of their career - an absolutely brain-mauling trawl through the blues staple \\"When the Levee Breaks\\". Plant's vocals bend, shriek, scrape, and soar through seven minutes of guitar sludge, intersticed with resounding harp moans echoing the browbeaten but defiant cries of the narrator. Simply astounding, heart shaking melodrama. Whoever said \\"always leave 'em wanting more\\" certainly got through to the boys in Led Zeppelin. <br /> <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Please buy these songs.  They are incredible.  The main voices of Elpheba and Glinda (Idina Menzel, Kristen Chenoweth) sing some of the greatest songs ever made.  The songs are not only funny but serious and can change people's perspective's on life.  I find the song \\"Defying Gravity\\" one of the greatest songs ever sung/written because the music is outstanding as well as the amazing voices to go along.  The message about changing your life and making a difference is moving.  Buying the music is one of the best ways to ever spend any money.
B000001FTD|5.0|Thought \\"Spreading the Disease\\" is in many ways the equal of this album, \\"Among the Living\\" was where Anthrax really started to hit their stride, both artistically and commercially.  They stood out from other thrash bands at the time by not taking themselves too seriously, a fact which can be easily ascertained from the subway shot in the interior artwork (oh, I miss those Jams shorts).  It was actually this album that first got me into reading Stephen King, with two of the tracks being based on the Maine Boogeyman's works.  The first of these, \\"Among the Living\\", starts off the album with an at-the-time-obligatory acoustic intro which segues into a monster mosh pit riff.  The lyrics themselves are fairly vague and could refer to any decisive struggle that pits man against man except that it explicitly references the Walking Dude from King's novel (it should also be noted that the cover of the album is intended to represent Randall Flagg).  Nonetheless, the song is anthemic in both it's content and the enthusiasm with which it's sung and played.    About half the songs on this album would become certified classics that would still be turning up in the band's setlist 10 years later, and perhaps none of these is more classic than the sophomore song on the album, \\"Caught in a Mosh\\".  The lyrics take a few liberties with the actual meaning of the word mosh, but suffice to say the band is somewhat cleverly using the maelstrom of the mosh pit as an analogy to any chaotic situation which one is unable to escape from.  The tune is more notable for it's veritable riff catalog than the lyrics, however, and appropriately this is one of the great moshing songs from the thrash era.    \\"I Am the Law\\" is a take on the Judge Dredd comic book series, and of course at the time I immediately tried to jump on the bandwagon, except the Judge Dredd series came out every week (unheard of at the time -- Marvel didn't pick up on the idea until several years later) and also it was an import,which would have meant spending about $8 whole dollars a month!!!  Hey, when you're 14 and have a $50 paper route these things add up.    \\"Efilnikufesin\\" (read it backward) takes it out of the sociological world and back down to a personal level as it chronicles the animosity of a bad breakup.  This we could relate to at the time, being pretty much outcasts at the time... geez, it seems hard to believe that 18 years ago only about 1% of the kids at school listened to heavy music and smoked the bud, which would have made us kings of the school in 2005, but sure as hell not 1987.    \\"Skeletons in the Closet\\" wraps up side one (not that this'll make a difference with your newfangled CDs and whatnot... kidding, I haven't owned a cassette since 1994 myself).  This being the second Stephen King adaptation, this time of \\"Apt Pupil\\".  While there are no bads songs on this album \\"Skeletons..\\" is slightly inferior to most of the others.  Let's say maybe this one and \\"One World\\" are only 9's while the rest are 10's.    \\"Indians\\" is another smoking classic.  There was nothing really new about sympathizing with the plight of Native Americans in 80s metal;  Maiden, in fact, did a better job lyrically with \\"Run to the Hills\\" five years earlier.  But Anthrax injected some righteous venom into their riffs, and catching them live, when Scott Ian yelled \\"WARDAAAAANCE!!!\\" just prior to the breakdown, you'd better either be ready to slam or sipping Cokes in the back of the stadium.    \\"One World\\" is a pleasant enough tune about peaceful co-existence, but again: it and \\"Skeletons...\\" make great mix tape fodder but don't quite reach the plateau of greatness the rest of the album boasts.      \\"ADI\\" starts off with another acoustic intro then slams you against the wall with probably THE monster riff on the album.  This one's about the threat of nuclear war - another omnipresent topic at the time - and the band's delivery will make you believe your ass is still on the line almost 20 years later.    Finally, \\"ATL\\" wraps up with \\"Imitation of Life\\", a rapid fire anomaly in the band's catalog, and probably the number one song I always wanted to hear them play live but never did, with it's supersonic speed and overlapping vocals.  Anyway, this one is another song about being fake, and seems to particularly apply to the people running the record business.  A fine way to end a major label LP.
B0000BWVCL|4.0|I hadn't seen the first X-Men movie, I have heard of it, so I just checked \\"X2\\" out and it was pretty good. I was never a fan of the animated X-Men series. I think besides Spiderman, it's great for the genre. The sci-fi/fantasy/action genre certainly is an extraordinary type. Just like Star Wars. One character I was quite fond of was the Nightcrawler AKA Kurt Wagner played by the neato actor Alan Cumming. I've read the trivia for this movie and it said that it took 10 hours to get his makeup on. Also, this movie is in the Guiness Book of World Records for being the movie that had the widest release on opening day: 3,741 screens! It's no wonder. I thought Lord of The Rings would have done something effective like that.  <br /> <br /> <br />Warning: The awesome action in this film can be head-spinning.
B0000CD8AB|3.0|Metallica have spent the last seven years claiming that anyone who doesn't like \\"Load\\" is a hatemonger out to stifle the band's musical ambitions. Pull up a seat, Lars, it's time we had a chat. <br />First of all, you guys made a bit of a left turn on 1991's so called \\"Black Album\\" (didn't Prince beat you to that one?), and many self respecting \\"old school\\" 'Tallica fans consider it hands down your finest hour. Do you honestly think it's the haircuts that made the difference this time around? Let's start with pre-LP single \\"Until It Sleeps\\". If I wanted dime store Smashing Pumpkins I'd have picked up \\"Adore\\" or that Zwan album. Hell, stick a pair of plugs up James' nostrils and you'd have a breathy instrumental. I still cannot figure out to this day why some people insist on pretending Hetfield can sing, but that's between you and me, Lars. We both know who the REAL backbone of this group is. <br /> <br />Next up: what's up with \\"Ain't my B**ch\\" exactly? Bet you spent a lot of time on that one, what with it's complex time signatures and grad school lyrics. Yes, Lars, I AM giving you sh*t. Frankly I'm tired of listening to yours. Have you noticed the fans at your shows getting younger and younger? Yes, Lars, the kids DO spend more money than their thirtysomething counterparts, that wasn't my point. Did you ever think maybe the fans are getting younger because teenagers are a bit less discriminating and thus easier to please intellectually? Wait, you think this is a GOOD thing? Lars, you're forty f**king years old. Name one forty year old Priest fan who thinks \\"Parental Guidance\\" is their best song. This is your legacy we're talking about here! Are you sure you want to cash all that in for a few quick bucks? OK, Lars, it's your life. Art is not a democracy, you're right. But I tell you what. Since you're not really making anything resembling art these days do you think you might be able to take a bit of constructive criticism? Oh? That's great! You say you have a roundtable discussion set up for your fans later on? And exactly where is this little shindig? Ah. The county courthouse. Say no more, Lars, say no more. <br /> <br />
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Funny, sad, and mind-blowing, 'Donnie Darko' is, quite simply, an excellent movie. The plot is complex and engaging, with Jake Gyllenhaal as the protagonist, followed up by a cast that doesn't leave Jake holding up the movie. <br /> <br />     Depending on what version of the film you see, the plot can be simple, or very hard to understand.  I saw the original version on television and it was easy to comprehend.  However, I had a lot of questions about little plot strings that weren't tied up.  Just the other day I saw the director's cut. I spent the rest of the night explaining things to the people who watched it with me while simultaneously figuring it out myself. <br /> <br />     But, let me explain first. In the original version of the movie the plot line goes like this. Donnie Darko is introduced as the protagonist.  He smokes, sees a therapist, and is rude to his parents.  Then comes the fateful night of October 2nd. <br /> <br />     Donnie is asleep when he hears a voice that tells him to follow it. Donnie gets up and walks out of the house and onto a golf course where a human sized, demented bunny rabbit called Frank tells him the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds. At the same time as this encounter a jet engine falls through Donnie's room, which would have crushed him had he not gone out to the golf course. For the next 28 days Donnie goes on certain missions by the bidding of Frank, gets a girlfriend, and finds out about time travel.  I wont tell the ending for the sake of preserving it. <br />      <br />      In the director's cut there are a few differences.  The beginning is the same. However, this time the end of the world mentioned by Frank really comes into play.  It is explained (and this is explained only in the director's cut) that Donnie is in a tangent universe separate from the primary universe, and it will collapse after a few weeks, creating a black hole in the primary universe destroying all of existence. <br/>      <br />       Donnie goes through the same adventures with a few differences here and there from the original version with the same ending result, only it is much clearer why he does what he does. <br />  <br />      I highly recommend this movie to those intelects who like to think about the plot, and to those who like dark comedy, and also to anyone and everyone, for this is truly not a film to be missed.
B00005HEFS|5.0|Radio saturation of nearly every track on this record may jade some listeners into underappreciating just what a landmark album \\"IV\\" actually was. After getting the somber, acoustic vibe out of their system on the last album it was all systems go for the Page/Plant tandem, and what a one-two punch this one starts out with. \\"Black Dog\\" practically invented Whitesnake's entire oeuvre with it's demonic boogie riff and Plant's piercing shrieks, sex, violence and all manner of ritualistic hedonism smelted together into a cast iron monolith to perfection. Before \\"Rock and Roll\\" was relegated to automobile spots it put forth the notion: \\"what if crack had been invented back in Jerry Lee Lewis' heyday\\"? The fact that such an irrepressible hallelujah (you can't tell me this song isn't a spiritual experience) was created out of fairly sober minds (ok, there was the coke) is a tribute of the love for the genre these British lads proffered back in the day.  <br /> <br />Proving \\"III\\" wasn't a fluke or botched experiment, \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" and \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" close out side one with ponderous odes to the band's Celtic heritage (the former) and God only knows (the latter).

B0002OERI0|5.0|I been reading the reviews for American Idiot and I am wondering what most of the people are talking about. Everyone seems to hate it just because it less punk and more pop than there past albums. If you want an album that is more punk go listen to Dookie and get over yourselves. American Idiot and Dookie are probably my two favourite Green Day cd's even though they are really different. I think American idiot is a great CD. It is a mixture of punk, hard and classic rock. Can you expect a band that's been playing for over fifteen years to stay the same. Billie Joe, Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool are over 30 years old. They matured from there punk days. \\"Punk rock is dead...and I f---ing killed it\\" -Billie Joe even admits it.  The reviews goes from one idiot saying that Green Day should stay punk to another idiot (like Batman)saying that Green Day has released the same bumble gum pop thing over and over again. I don't know how you can call American idiot unoriginal.  I looked at Batmans other reviews and I saw the same that they pretty much wrote the same thing that they wrote about Green Day (say old boring story). Can this person come up with any original ideas for writing a review? In all his review all he does is winge about how bad they are. Is this guy queer or what?  Batman probably has some weird taste of music that alot of others wouldn't like.    Then I see some stupid kid that says that the story of this rock opera goes on about how St Jimmy and Wahtsername move to some haunted house. Somebody please tell what's wrong with this stupid kid or at least what he is huffing. Don't listen to that review they have no idea of the story of American Idiot. One of the most accurate review on her i s probably The Wiseguys which is found on the third page of the reviews    You should ignore these reviews that don't eaplain American idiot and just say wrong info or that its the same old pop crap.    Anyway, I leave you to read the other morons reviews and actually talk about American Idiot.    As you can see it is a rock opera anjd you've probably already read about what its about in the other reviews (as I have already sai The Wiseguy's review is really good). I brought this album for the first three singles that were released (which I thought were excellant) and found about how good the other songs are. I don't care what the retards that have written the bad reviews say I still think it's a good album. And apparently so does many other people cuz it won the Grammy for Best Rock Album of the Year in 2004.     It's not as if the whole album just pop as the other reviewers have said.St Jimmy is a fast-paced song that like other revieweres have said would seem to belong on one of their previous punk albums. Other songs I like for the speed are She's A Rebel and Letterbomb. It's not like the songs that are   more pop are about mushy crap as it may seem. Extraordinary Girl has a different sound to it that has never been heard before on a Green Day cd. Whatsername is a great song. I especially like the change in the rhythym from a soft song to a heavier song. Whatsername and Holiday are two of my favourite songs. I love the Holiday's lyrics and the introduction is great. I think it deserves more recognition than it's gotten. I never would have thought Wake Me Up When September ends would haven't gotten so much recognition. I think it's a great song but the video clip is overdone especially the beginning. We all love American Idiot and Boulevard and you'll probably love the other tracks too, unless you expect the same thing that they've been doing for the last 18 years. Green Day has changed (for the better) and leaves there punk roots to do something which is original and unexpected ( I don't know how people call American Idiot unoriginal. they probably need to actually licton to it and read the lyrics to find out it's a rock opera not just some anti-Bush Cd).     I recommend you check out Favourite Son A Green Day song that is on Rock Against Bush Vol. 2. That is an actual anti-Bush song. You should also check out The Offspring and Simple Plan, especially if you want more punk.     If you want softer rock you should check out Something For Kate.    \\"I think the little bush is a bit stupid and more or less the puppet of his old man.\\" -Billie Joe  \\"All my religious beliefs are based on Star Wars.\\" - Mike Dirnt  \\"It's fun until someone gets hurt...then it's halarious.\\" - Billie Joe    I got these cool quotes from [...]you should check it out.
B0002Y4TZG|5.0|There is perhaps no more appropriate totem for the world of punk rock than the cover of \\"London Calling\\", a perfect aping of Elvis Presley's first album - including the same pink and green font scheme - only featuring Paul Simenon smashing his bass on stage as opposed to Elvis strumming his guitar and singing placidly (at least by comparison). There is also no greater example of a band whose sophomore album was universally panned by comparison with it's era-defining debut, only to come back and put something out which would silence the critics (including finicky fans) forever - or at least until the solo careers kicked in.  <br /> <br />\\"London Calling\\" manages the rare feat of being everything to everyone; there are an almost maniacal variety of musical genres been played off of here, and not a single one is brought off in anything less than triumphant fashion. Whereas the Clash had toyed with reggae in a more reverent fashion on their first album, with \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\" they fully realize how punk and reggae can blend rather than simply co-exist. \\"London Calling\\" is stark and anthemic, with it's prophecy that civilization as we know it is experiencing a revolution, a sentiment no more cleverly illustrated than in the line \\"phone Beatlemania/has bitten the dust\\". \\"Hateful\\" is another catchy hybrid-pop tune with sociological lyrics, a hallmark of this album if there is one.  <br /> <br />The band reach a new peak with \\"Spanish Bombs\\", a song that is propellant in rhythm while still being built on minor chords, a paeon to the Spanish Civil War which reaches it's richest symbolism in the line \\"my Senorita's rose was nipped in the bud\\". Horns make their way into \\"The Right Profile\\" as they both mock and salute the tragic life of Montgomery Clift, and the 80s focus on consumerism is given precognitive analysis in \\"Lost in the Supermarket\\". My favorite song on the album is probably \\"The Card Cheat\\". Over swelling piano and horns, Joe Strummer illustrates the plight of the man who seeks heroism in inauspicious times. Moving from a man looking to succeed his adversaries in the Wild West maelstrom of saloon gambling to less metaphorical examples such as those who have fought unjust wars for incompetent kings, Strummer urges \\"before you met your fate, but sure you did not foresake/your lover...\\". \\"Clampdown\\" is another pop song typical of the album's style, a vaguely Caribbean influenced number with politically charged lyrics, this one dealing with the purposelessness of willful admission into the rat race in no uncertain Marxist terms.  <br /> <br />And of course everyone knows \\"Train in Vain\\", although it was a late addition to the album and wasn't even listed on the record sleeve, hence providing an early example of the \\"bonus track\\" (in fact, even the original CD issue failed to list it, although the reissue campaign of the early 2000s finally fixed this issue --- personally I thought it was a lot more fun when you just had to know it was there).  <br /> <br />Altogether, not only are there no weak tracks on this album, but with \\"London Calling\\" the Clash fused punk and more popular strains of rock 'n' roll in a unique way that no one has ever been able to replicate, including the band themselves (follup LP \\"Sandinista\\" would be heavily criticized for exactly that: attempting to match the eclecticism of it's predecessor while both overreaching and underachieving at the same time). When I hear people argue over who's the greatest rock band of all time, it invariably comes down to a choice between the Beatles, the Stones, Led Zeppelin, or some other band of that classic rock ilk. With \\"London Calling\\" the cornerstone of their legacy, I don't see any reason why the Clash can't be considered just as relevant and timeless as any of those bands, and this album proves you don't have to like raw, dirty, two chord punk rock snottiness to appreciate what the Clash have to offer. <br /> <br />In 2004 \\"London Calling\\" was reissued in a stellar Legacy Edition featuring a bonus disc of lost demos and versions as well as a third disc of DVD footage.

B00021R7CG|4.0|By Dawn's Early Light is one of those movies that could only be made by HBO.  There are no big name TV personalities thrown in for their star value or any ridiculous plot twists that might appeal to the simple minded viewer.  This is one of those movies that came from a time when there was a very real threat for the survival of the world and this movie tells the story of one of those scenarios.    With the dissolution of the Soviet Union control over their nuclear arsenal was, as it is now, suspect.  There was a time when hard line stalwarts from an earlier time (on both sides) believed that a nuclear war was survivable and could be won (remember the duck and cover drills we did where if you hid under your school desk you would survive a nuclear blast or the promise that even after a nuclear blast the US Postal Service would still be able to deliver the mail?).    When renegades from the old Soviet Union fire nuclear salvos at the US (including Washington DC), and with most of the communications and elected leadership of this country decimated, a battle ensues between soldiers who have been trained to follow orders without question and those that might question the validity of those orders when considering the current situation.  We also have a similar battle of wills amongst the top echelon of what's left of the elected leadership of this country and the remaining military leadership advising them.    The cast is superb, the storyline extrememly believable and well thought out and the production values first rate.  This is one of those movies that belongs on people's shelves to be watched from time to time for pure entertainment value.  The viewer will walk away from this movie not in awe of the special effects we see all too often these days, nor will he think he has just seen the latest from Masterpiece Theatre.  He won't won't walk away suddenly endowed with all of the secrets to life but he will walk away knowing he's been entertained and got his money's worthout of this movie.
B00025ETIW|5.0|With their psuedo goth-punk look, unorthodox name, and sketchy if not somewhat juvenile song titles, I'm not ashamed to admit that I wrote this band off, at first, as being another melodramatic emo-trash group that no one except those who FREEBASE emo music and culture into their system could appreciate.     You know, the kind of people who hang out at skateparks with quaffy, psuedo new-wave hairdo's and sit at the top of half-pipes making fun of the fact that you don't know who \\"From Autumn to Ashes\\" is or the fact that you consider \\"Dashboard Confessional\\" and \\"Brand New\\" to be legit emo. You know, those jerks who will rave and rave about a group one minute, but the second said band's video plays on TRL or Fuse they cry \\"SELL OUT\\".    To me, the emo scene is just as bigoted and closed-minded as our forefather's punk scene was 30 odd years ago.    The scene is lame, biased, and, like any other scene, hypocritical at its core, but in all honesty a great deal of the music is very compelling.    Acts like Thrice, Matchbook Romance, and Underoath have put forth great albums with splendid musical arrangments that are complemented by intelligent and complleing lyrics dealing with everything from heartbreak to political angst to the turmoils of the inner self. These talented acts help to positively build upon the image of American music and further help to inspire artists like them.     And with that being said, I can say confidently that My Chemical Romance's \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\" can be added to that glorious roster.    With their raging rhythms, crystal leads, and captivating vocals, MCR have proven themselves worthy to be set apart from the more generic and uninteresting emo acts such as Hawthorne Heights or the bland mundanity of the once intriguing Taking Back Sunday. This is a group that you can proudly blare on your stereo or MP3 player and anyone with any real taste in modern rock (be it emo or otherwise) can't touch you.    Probably the biggest standout on this effort is the opening track \\"Helena\\". Whoa! Now this is how you start off an album right! The haunting near whisper of Gerard Way's (vocals) \\"Long ago...\\" along with the single note, palm-muted friction further excentuating his gasps softly coaxes you to draw closer to the song. Then out of no where, a ferocious wall of raw aggresion pummels you into submission. The verses chruning out crunchy, guitar-driven harmonies with Way's voice searing and soaring the whole way. Then comes the chorus, delivering a dramatic tension and intense melody to help bring the song back full circle to the next verse. And the solemn, and almost eery, bridge brings the song back to its epic chorus for an amazing conclusion. The second single off of this CD, it truly stands out as one of the best. An amazing song to get the album up-and-running.    That rapid fire pace is kept going strong with the following tracks \\"Give 'Em Hell Kid\\" and the absolutely exquisite \\"To The End.\\" On the latter of these two tracks, the cryptic storytelling lyrical style and the beatuifully tonal lead progressions played by afroed lead guitarist Ray Toro (or it could possibly be other guitarist Frank Iero, I'll admit I'm not certain) adds a great deal to the desperation and despair that this songs conveys.    This rapid fire progression is only enhanced by the next (and unfortunately titled) track \\"You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison\\" featuring an uncredited Bert McCracken (of another equally gifted act \\"The Used\\")singing backup (note: the maniacal little chuckle at the end of this song will send a shiver up your spine.)    Then of course, there's \\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\\" the track that started it all (well, at least in the eyes of the mainstream anyway :-P.) A very good, upbeat song with a huge climax, roaring vocals and guitars, a lightning quick chorus. Although the guitar solo isn't going to really impress too many people, it still feels very appropriate and does not take anythingaway from the song.    And then, the album decides to slow down a bit with the serene, yet still grandoise \\"The Ghost of You\\". It's blissfully tragic lyrics and meloncholy lead bring out the soul of the song and give it a very deep and tranquil feel. Then the instumrments quickly build up to let out the explosive chorus. I dare anyone not to sing along to Way's gripping lines and wrenching confessions. This song would make an exquisite single. If the Grammy committee weren't run by fuddy-duddy no-nothing fops (Sorry, but these days I don't think that there would be too many people out there who would disagree with that statement. No true artists anyway.) then I would certainly be tempted to regail this song as record of the year, but that's just one 20-something's opinion. A truly mesmerizing tune.    After this brief, yet only slight change of pace, the listener is thrown back into full throtle with another (also unfortunately titled) song \\"The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You.\\" Throbbing beats pulsate throughout this song and while it is not the best song on th album, it certainly keeps the listener interested.    But after this song things get a little iffy...    The whisper quiet and solemn \\"Interlude\\" serves as an introductory track to \\"Thank You For the Venom\\", but the pillowy soft nature of \\"Interlude\\" contrasts so vividly from the almost metallic thumping of \\"Venom\\"  that it reall kills off a bit of the effect that the latter song has overall. Which is really a shame becuase \\"Venom\\" is a great track. It's pulse-pounding beat and nail-driving verse make it one of the hardest songs on the whole CD. Not bad a bad tune on it's own, but I recommend skipping \\"Interlude\\" if you can.    And after that song things get very iffy...    The tracks \\"Hang 'Em High\\" and (ugh, these titles!) \\"It's Not a Fashion Statement, It's a Deathwish\\", while not awful songs by any means sound very generic and uninspired. \\"Hang 'Em High\\" starts out well enough with a great verse and interesting lyrics, but the chorus feels a little mismatched with the rest of the song, and the outro is just utter chaos. And \\"Fashion Statement\\" really has no stand out attributes to it at all. It just feels like a very plain (though still not terrible) track.    But the album does get an uplift from another slower paced track \\"Cemetary Drive.\\" With wrenching, painful lyrics and more wonderfully played leads, this song acts as somewhat of a beacon in the darkness of medioocrity that threatens the latter half of this album. The track is not quite as grippng as \\"Ghost of You\\" but it is compelling nonetheless and worthy of a least a few good listens.     The biggest letdown though is the pedestrian final track \\"I Never Told You What I Do For a Living.\\" Nothing sets it apart from the worst of the tracks on this CD and when it's finally over, you're left feeling as if you've come up a little short. A bit ironic that an album that starts off so bombastly would end with such a disappointing fizzle, but it is still not unlistenable by any means. Fans will probably get a kick out of it, but it isn't going to win them any praise on the whole.    \\"Three Cheers...\\" is an album that starts off amazingly, but tapers off a bit towards the end. But don't be scared away by a few mediocre outings. The whole of this album may not be greater than its parts, but the parts are so brilliantly done that you won't mind wading through a few muddy tracks to get to them. A truly enjoyable listen for any fan of rock. A MUST HAVE for anyone into emo of any sorts.    \\"Because if you don't have this album then you're a fake and a loser douchebag communist :-P.\\"     Sorry, I couldn't help myself with that. No matter how quaffed or unquaffed your hair may be (:-D) this is still a good album to have in your library. I don't care how legit or unlegit that may be!     Nootch.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Beats, choirs, raps, brit pop, guitars, guest artists, spoken word and many more genres and music styles are blended into this amazing album.<br /><br />Danger Mouse is brought on board on production detail to accomplish the complex task to make many genres and styles blend seamlessly into great tracks. Dan Nakamura did a great job on the first album and Danger Mouse does too.<br /><br />Of all the artists that guest star on this album my favorite collaboration has to be the track DARE which features Happy Monday's crazy lead singer Shaun Ryder, this track can sure get a dance party going with its beats and house music feel.<br /><br />All in all, a great album. Creativity and musicianship, what else can you want from a record?<br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br />Note: there's a track named Dirty Harry. What Clint Eastwood reference can we expect on a third Gorillaz album? (Maybe a track named outlaw josey wales)

B0009MDPYM|1.0|Disgraceful take on the classic horror comic book is a travesty of the highest order. I would love to meet the idiot who actually thought that Keanu Reeves was a great choice for the role of John Constantine, one of the most complex figures in modern pop literature. His bad performance is the perfect middle finger to the fans and creators of the comic book series who wanted a quality production of their favorite comic book character. The rest of the film is tailor made to give Keanu free reign to totally screw up with a script so badly written that you can see how embarrass some of the actors are in saying some of the dialog and a director who does not have a clue on how to stage a scene. The special effects are of low standard and the cinematography does not give off the right feel. The movie does have a few shining moments with Rachel Weisz giving this film more class and dignity than it deserved with a powerhouse performance that deserved a better film that this and Djimon Hounsou, who's game performance is a fitting tribute to the comic book character he is playing. I don't know why the movie trait so for a way from the comic because if they at least stay true to the comic's core, it would have been a great film but with the egos involved in Hollywood who think they know more than the fans or the creators of this comic do, we have this piece of garbage
B00005JMAH|3.0|I didn't enjoy this movie as much of the previous two.I follow the books more than the movies and in the end of the fourth book things start to dramatically change. I guess I don't like it as much because there was so much change. It seemed like it had a taste of lord of the rings in it. I have nothing against lord of the rings but its just not the same. I liked it but it didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the series. I  probably set my expectation too high since the third book is my favorite. I think you would enjjjoy the movie ecspesially if you don't expect it to be like  the other movies.
B000957O82|4.0|A \\"date doctor\\" helps a loser get the girl, but can't help himself get one. Kevin James steals the show in this one, if you like King of Queens check it out, he plays the same character with a different name. <br /> <br />I thought all the \\"deep advice\\" on how to get a woman was kind of funny and over the top some of the time. I hope no young men out there buy this movie so they can learn how to pick up women. I can help them with that. <br /> <br />To get a woman follow three steps: <br />1) Buy a Ferrari <br />2) Be seen in your Ferrari <br />3) Enjoy all the women that you will spend time with. <br /> <br />I give this movie 4 stars because it started a bit slow and was a bit too chick flick in spots. Plus, a bit of nudity would have helped.
B0000039QA|5.0|This album is great but it also is disapointing because it was the last piece of material that B.I.G was to ever have released while he was still alive and only one week after this albums release he was gundowned in L.A. This album wasn't exactly my favourite album at first and i wasnt all that im pressed and thought it was overated as an album, but after awhile i decided to throw in discman before i went to school the catchy lyrics of puffy really got me into the album and the more you listen to it the more things you pic up in big's lyrics lyk really cleaver catchy double meanings and I think this is a good example of why B.I.G is and deserves to be considered one of the greatist of all time. I highly recommend you go out and buy this album, F**k the 2pac and  big bull s**t it died years ago n there is no reason for ne1 2 still hate on b.i.g because at the tym of the beef they were on tupacs, or vis versa with b.i.g fans, take this album for what it is,  QUALITY MUSIC, get out n buy the f***in album
0930289528|5.0|It's a great story, but the Amazon editors mangle it just a bit. Their description should read: <br /> <br />\\"A frightening and powerful story of the loss of freedom and identity in a totalitarian world, V for Vendetta takes place in an alternate future in which nuclear war has left a fascist England as the sole super-power. A vigilante named \\"V\\" stalks the streets of London trying to free England of its ideological chains.

B0007OCG56|2.0|I found this movie \\"watchable\\" and the performances were good.  However, I found the message of this movie disturbing. <br /> <br />Flor (Paz Vega) is a wonderful housekeeper.  She's warm, loving and caring ... and of course, beautiful. This IS Hollywood! Her daughter is also all of the above and the \\"lady of the house\\", Deborah (Tea Leoni) likes her a lot. She spoils her without her mother's approval. However, Deborah also arranges for the daughter to go to a good school on a scholarship. At the end of the movie, Flor quits her job and insists her daughter leave the school, despite Deborah and her spineless husband insisting that she stays.  The daughter gets upset about this, thinking of her future of course. Flor utters \\"wise\\" words stating that the daughter seems unimpressed that she might end up like her mother one day and is she ashamed? The daughter whole-heartedly accepts this as gospel.   <br /> <br />Hello?!? <br /> <br />Flor is a gorgeous woman who has done well with herself as an illegal immigrant, but hey - is there anything wrong with grabbing the chance to excel beyond housekeeper?!  Has that got anything to do with being ashamed of your mother?! Nada. <br /> <br />I found that message quite ordinary and I ended up wanting to punch that sweet Flor. It completely ruined the movie for me.
B00005JNTX|3.0|First off, I loved the movie! Great stories, Great action, awesome visuals, and Gorgeous babes! What else do you want? Now my one and only complaint is this DVD coming out. Why do the greedy film makers have to release a bare bones edition and later a special directors edition with all the extra goodies? Well, I'll tell you why. There are too many sheep out there who cant wait another few months to own the movie. Come on, you've waited years to have the movie made. You've waited 3 months for a dvd release. Wait a few more months for the loaded with extras edition. Why do you need 2 copies of the same movie??? Come on, lets send a message to the film companies that we are not mindless sheep. Release the super duper special directors cut mega blaster edition ONLY!
0312323859|5.0|After reading Something Borrowed (which I LOVED) I hated Darcy and couldn't imagine wanting to read about her, so when this book was released I had doubts about buying it. Why would I want to read a book about Darcy, the women who I thought got what she deserved (being cheated on) in the first book? The woman who is snotty, bratty, spoiled and selfish!  <br />Well, needless to say, I decided to buy it. I'm SO glad I did! Emily Giffin did a great job at writing this book. I was happy to find that it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Throughout the book I found myself going from not liking Darcy to rooting for her to get what she now deserves, love.  <br />I say give this book a try, and you wont be disappointed. If you haven't read Something Borrowed, I say try that first since it was the first one out.

1594200440|3.0|Edward Albee once said of his play &lt;strong>The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?&lt;/strong> that the first act is a comedy, the second act a drama, the third act a tragedy. When I was about halfway through Lewycka's novel, I thought this was the structure she was attempting, and I thought it was working. Unfortunately, I think matters are resolved a bit too neatly in the end for the book to really work--at least, to really stick with you. I finished it two days ago, and it is already sliding out of my mind. <br /> <br />The book is about an old man, a widower, who wants to marry a much younger Ukrainian woman so she can move to Britain permanently, without fear of deportation. Complications ensue, of course, the most important of which is the personality of the woman in question--she is larger-than-life awful.  <br /> <br />The novel is told from the point of view of the man's younger daughter, Nadia, as she and her sister attempt to disentangle her father from the mess he created. One of the big problems for me us that I didn't feel the narrator had been embued with a lot of personality. She talks a lot about having socialist political beliefs, but it is hard to imagine someone so bland believing anything very strongly. <br /> <br />One of the major subplots of the book is Nadia's prickly relationship with her sister, Vera, who does not share her political views--Vera has spent her life striving for affluency. This subplot and the rest of the novel fit together like two jigsaw pieces that a frustrated child has forced together--but the story of Nadia and her sister was for me by far the strongest part of the book. The most affecting moment of the book, and the only moment I will take away, is a conversation between Nadia and Vera in which they recall a searing childhood memory, and realize that their lives today stem from it. <br /> <br />In the end, this book was only okay: entertaining in the short term, a quick and easy read, but not something I'll remember for very long.
B000063JDE|4.0|Definately one of the best films to come out of the 80's. This movie definately has a very dark edge. Even those who don't \\"get it\\" have to admit that they've never seen anything quite like it. One of the most original opening sequences in movie history.

B00005AWMF|5.0|Tonight we have Sade Adu (love the name) in the next room singing about \\"The Sweetest Taboo\\": \\"You have the biggest heart/Sometimes I think you're just too good for me.\\"  Right.  Well.  The biggest something or other...  Sade (of the name from the Marquis de Sade from France during the worst of the decadence--thank you for the two-syllable pronunciation) you will recall has the cutest butt (from the video where they have her spin and spin, just so we can be sure and see how well put together she is) and a very high, almost male syndrome baldness forehead.  She has Asian eyes touched with the dark lashes of the Mediterranean and the skin of north Africa.  Sensuous lips.  Her thin eyebrows are carefully painted on and you know she doesn't have an extra hair on her body.  She strangely reminds me of my best old buddy when I was a kid, a tall guy we called Longo, whose mother had \\"passed\\" in New Orleans and had come west--why I don't know.  (Why she reminds me; I know why she came west.)  \\"Your love is wider than Victoria Lake/Taller than the Empire State... Is it a crime?\\"  No Sade, it is not.<br /><br />I love to read the blurb on the jacket and see who wrote the songs.  There are some good ones on this CD, \\"The Best of Sade.\\"  The two standards (to recall a usage), \\"The Sweetest Taboo\\" and \\"Smooth Operator\\" are here.  I just love the way she sings \\"From L.A. to Chicago.../Across the north, south to Key Largo, love for sale.\\"  The \\"Key Largo\\" is so perfect.  Also excellent are the haunting \\"Jezebel\\" and \\"No Ordinary Love.\\"<br /><br />\\"Hang on to Your Love\\" is psychologically interesting and musically compelling.  \\"In heaven's name why do you play these games/Hang on to your love.\\"  I'm not so crazy about \\"Your Love Is King,\\" which politically reminds me of \\"Captain of My Heart\\" by somebody, but it is a nice song.  \\"Love Is Stronger Than Pride,\\" has some psychological punch and she really sells it.<br /><br />Sade Adu is the major song writer on most of the tunes, but I can tell that Andrew Hale is the gift behind some of the most successful ones.  Most of the lyrics are pure Sade, who knows the psychology as it runs in her veins.  My favorite song on the CD is number sixteen, the misnamed \\"Pearls,\\" written by Hale and Sade.  Better titles would have been \\"The Woman of Somalia\\" or, just go with the unforgettable refrain, \\"...hurts like brand new shoes.\\"  If you can hear that song and not get choked up when Sade sings \\"She lives in a world she didn't choose/And it hurts like brand new shoes,\\" you just aren't paying attention.<br /><br />She can sing it.  Her concentration is complete and she doesn't try too hard or get too fancy.  She has something of Sinatra in his prime and the feel of Billie Holiday (if she'd done bossa nova).  She just sings the song, and gives it a hundred percent, and sits down.  And she is cute., but I can tell that Andrew Hale is the gift behind some of the most successful ones.

B0009YA37W|4.0|'editors?' fortunately what editors (no article 'the') lack in a quality band name, they more than make up for on their debut album.<br /><br />one of the few bands to actually produce something worthwhile in this whole questionable 'nu wave revival,' editors pack a lot more emotional wallop than nu-wave wannabes like the bravery and the killers. and editors, unlike the bravery and the killers, actually understand what it means to write a decent song.  while a lot of the songs do sound reasonably similar, none of the songs come off sounding repetitive. the album is full of great basslines, jackhammer drumming, and kaleidascopic guitars.<br /><br />tom's vocals are deceptively sincere and heartfelt, in a mortician sort of way. that's not to say, however, that he can't carry a melody, because he sure can--insert comparisons to paul banks, ian mcculloch, and yes, ian curtis here.<br /><br />vocal queue's aside, editors really know how to write a top notch tune. 'munich' (the best track on the album, in my opinion) is a corker -- swirling guitars, deadpan (but sincere)vocals, soaring chorus and the great line 'with one hand you calm me, with one hand i'm still.' it's one of the year's top singles and should get the band noticed on this side of the pond. *should.*<br /><br />'back room' is a very solid and promising debut.  great vocals and lyrics, infectious hooks, solid musicianship. like most decent bands coming out of the UK, editors will, unfortunately, most likely go unnoticed outside snobby indie music circles. but when tom pronounces an edict like 'you'll speak when your spoken to' on 'munich,' one gets the feeling editors will tell YOU when to listen.

0312263120|3.0|Dan Brown focuses his attention on the cyberspace front and while there are some taut moments and some intrigue throughout most of the book, the ending left me with a bad taste in my mouth. It was though the publishing company gave Brown a good two days to write the last thirty pages. It was rushed and obvious, wrapped up in a spectacularily quick fashion that was ultimately unsatisfying. It was as though Dan Brown wrote most of it, sat down, watched a bad episode of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and decided &quot;I could tie my ending together in a matter of two pages ...&quot;. This is his first book and it shows in the ending. You can enjoy it but the disappointment in the ending takes away from an interesting premise and Dan Brown's incredible writing style.
B0006L16N8|1.0|I'll start off by saying that I enjoy a fair amount of Coldplay's music. <br /> <br />X&Y, however, I could not get into. It lacks innovation, imagination, and variation. All of the songs are the same melodically. They all start slowly and build into a crescendo, but one that dissapoints every time. If you're looking for similar music, try Rufus Wainwright. He has a very unique voice, but unlike Coldplay has some true vocal talent, and his music starts slow and builds, finishing well. Coldplay, it seems, has tried their hand at this--having already saturated their work with acoustic ballads and piano-driven songs, it seems as if they are doing something new in the hope that it might catch on. They were lucky, because most Coldplay fans ate this album up without really thinking about how atrocious it is. Truth is, Coldplay failed miserably.
B000002UVX|5.0|In every man there's something that pulls at him to go back to the roots of your being. Band of Gypsies represents Jimi's attempt to get back to the basics. By blending grooves, melody and a totally pioneering commitment to the creative process the musicians that made up the Band of Gypsies had no peer. It's a shame that they never got a chance to fully develop the concept of this group. For the Hendrix fan, the album represents the fullest sound as the music began to become stereo and Hendrix' sound began to sound more textured and beautiful. Totally under control and totally ahead of the time. <br /> <br />I miss the brother.
B00005JNZ4|5.0|I recently enjoyed this simple, light and airy confection knowing that I would buy it as soon as it was available on DVD.  I loved the family relationships as well as the love story....sans the blatent sex and violence that are a must in most modern films.

When I leave a movie theatre with a smile on my face and laughter in my heart I know it's a keeper.
B000002UB3|4.0|All of the Beatles albums show the growth of the band, in that they don't do the same old thing over and over.  However, by the end of the Beatles' run, you could count on an album having a weird John Lennon song, something sung by Ringo, a song by George that is either opaquely Eastern or astonishingly good, and the usual McCartney-esque songs.  This album has all that, plus the maddening extension of the Partial Beatles Song to nearly an entire side of the album. <br /> <br />This latter was pioneered on the White Album.  I swear, I wonder if they just couldn't finish a bunch of their songs so they strung 'em all together. <br /> <br />This album, and Let It Be, clearly show that the Lennon-McCartney team was not working well anymore.  Both albums, in a way, are carried by George with his increasingly good work.  \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" is a really good song.  George's thin, reedy little voice does not do this one justice, but it is still good. <br /> <br />BUT I STILL LIKE THIS ALBUM!!  I have listened to this for over 25 years now and I still reach for it because, like all Beatles albums, there is something about it that makes me think, and something that I really enjoy.   <br /> <br />Those of you that are new to the Beatles...I would recommend buying one of the compilation albums, like \\"The Beatles (1967-1970)\\" or the No 1 album before leaping into the individual albums.  If you like those, then try out Abbey Road or the white album.
B0009MDPYW|1.0|Vile adaptation of the great comic book is not only a misrepresentation of what the comic is actually about but an incoherent adaptation as well. It takes the book's premise and literally steps on it for the sake of milking it for a cheap affect. Keanu Reeves is miscast and his performance is so bad, it's vile.  He has a charm but it does not come across here in this film and he looks like he's making a joke out of his performance. Rachel Weisz does carry this movie on her shoulders by giving it its only good performance but she gets no support from the script and the direction, which is flimsy to say the least. The story is incoherent and the screenplay is a mess. The special effects were done better before in other movies and the cinematography is shot way too dark to see some times.  <br /> <br />Worth a look just for Rachel Weisz's better than the film performance but other than her great effort to be better than the horrible script, the rest of the film lacks not only her professionalism but her grace as well.  <br />
0634049011|5.0|Although I have only been playing the guitar for three months now, this is without a doubt the best book that I have run across that teaches the basics of the fret board.  The exercises are geared to ensure a fundamental understanding, as well as retention. As with all good instructors, Mr. Tagliarino emphasizes practicing at a rate where it is almost impossible to make a mistake.  A must for anyone who wants to learn the guitar.
B00008EY65|4.0|I'm not a great comic book fan, and I might not have bothered if I'd realized that this was a comic book adaptation. I haven't come across many that I liked. But I liked this one.<br /><br />Its charm is that it doesn't try to take itself seriously. The nervous and worried Dr. Bloom steers his team of soldiers across a hidden Scottish island where the Nazis, led by a supposedly reborn Rasputin, are busy opening a Portal into this world to let nasty demons through (why do people *do* that?! Same reason as they always go down into the basement, I guess...) They more or less thwart the process, but a little red demon pops through. Dr. Bloom tempts it with Baby Ruth bars, and a friendship is born.<br /><br />Off we go, sixty years later. Red has grown up into a red equivalent of the Incredible Hulk. He chain-smokes cigars, stuffs plateloads of pancakes, and gives his new keeper (FBI agent John Myers) a hard time. Nonetheless, a reluctant friendship develops as they fight the plot to kill the hell critters brought back by - of course - Rasputin's girlfriend. (She follows the instructions in a book handed to her before Rasputin meets Grisly Death #2. and brings him back.)<br /><br />It's a fairly standard good-vs-evil kaboom movie, but what I loved about it was the dialogue and the humour. There are a lot of wonderful one-liners and visual puns. Red is so laid-back as to be hilarious, taking each challenge in a \\"oh well, here we go\\" kind of a way. Fighting off the devil dogs in a public train station, he still finds the time to rescue and return a box of kittens to their owner (what the heck is someone doing with an open box of kittens on a train, anyway)? And the romance between Red and Liz, a firestarter who eventually returns from the psychiatric ward after burning it down, does not run smooth, but offers a nice harmony to the rest of the riot.<br /><br />So yes, I enjoyed this in the end. It was fun. It made me laugh. And the special effects were special.

B000059Z8J|5.0|When I first saw Superman: The Movie (back in 1989 on TV when Tim Burton's Batman was getting major hype) I fell in love with the character and the comics right away. To this day it still eclipses all other super hero movies IMO. I wasn't aware there was extra footage that was not shown before, but after seeing the Special Edition DVD, the story was more powerful. Christopher Reeve perfomance was excellent and he will always be Superman to me. Hackman was spectacular as arch-villain Lex Luthor and Brando (as Superman's father, Jor-El) was fantastic.
B000001ZS4|5.0|If I lost my entire CD collection tommorow (and it's quite large) first thing on my mind would be to replace Equinox by JMJ. <br />I have this theory that the second attempt or project is very often the best - eg Mad Max  - the second and the best of that film trilogy. <br />Well Its certainly true of Jean Michel Jarre. Oxygene came in 76 and was a breath of fresh air that we still remember fondly. By the time he was making Equinox in 78 he had learned all the lessons and was still so good musically, so intense and energetic in terms of creativity. This work has imortalised him. <br /> <br />My first hearing of this was somewhere unusal - Equinox Part 1 was used on Carl Sagan's Cosmos TV program to depict a last perfect day on Earth when the Sun swells into a red giant and all our oceans dry up signalling the natural end of the world. Well this is the most perfect depiction I've ever seen put to music. It filled me with wonder. <br />  <br />That's exactly what the opening sequence in Equinox always does - profound and powerfull. You can't ignore it. Hair-raising.Yet also beautiful and earthly like the whole of Equinox - right through to the the end which feels like the end of an unforgettable day, tearful and nostalgic. Equinox involkes the seasons, life on Earth in all it's festivities but not merily an observation of nature. This is through the mind of a human and conveys the awarness of the beautiful Earth around him,  a theme to which Jean Michel would return. <br />I recall in 1981 cycling to school with My Sony walkman playing Equinox while all around me was the spring morning and the fog layers over the marshland in the west of Ireland. This is what Equinox is about. Sunrise and sunsets.Nothing about electronics. Go ask JMJ. <br />I always imagine that Peer Gynt himself witnissing the sun rise over the Sahera would have taken his hat off to Equinox. <br /> <br />They say in marketing \\"never change a classic\\". Well to top it all off we have a wonderful albumcover which I hope will never be tampered with by the record company.

B000005IZ8|5.0|Philip Glass gets a bad rap as a one-trick pony and this album is one of the best pieces of evidence that he isn't. True, this record sometimes employs Glass's strong minimalist roots and the familiar ascending/descending melodic lines repeated over and over again like some sort of avant-garde military marching band that are his staple. But most of it is very different, and these sections are usually short and shift rapidly, unlike the epic, 20-minute builds of \\"Koyaanisqatsi.\\" At times it is ambient, at other times rousing and spirited. \\"The Anthem\\" (part two of which was used to great effect in \\"The Truman Show\\" along with selections from Glass's similar \\"Anima Mundi\\" score) manages to be both, and is powerfully symbolic of what \\"Powaqqatsi\\" (\\"life in transformation,\\" if I recall the loosely translated definition of the word) is about. While this record runs a little long, it's brilliantly creative New Age classical and works both with the movie and on its own.
0393324818|5.0|Even though I enjoyed Lewis' Liar's Poker, The New New Thing, and Money Culture, I wasn't planning to read Moneyball. I like to read about money and about baseball, but I don't really care about the economics of baseball. Then I found out that Moneyball is about the Oakland A's, computers, and statistics. I had to read it.<br /><br />Lewis reveals how the A's became a top team even though they have one of the smallest payrolls in baseball. Billy Beane's (the general manager) method of using massive amounts of statistical information tells him what players to draft and what plays to execute under different conditions. The scouts and even the manager have become less important than his small staff of number-crunchers.<br /><br />By following certain statistically-determined rules such as \\"never sacrifice bunt,\\" (the numbers show that historically, it doesn't pay off) the A's have gone to the playoffs year after year. Beane refuses to draft players out of high school, because they haven't faced enough real competition to determine, statistically, if they will be any good. It's only in college and the minor leagues that players compile meaningful stats.<br /><br />There isn't much money in Moneyball, but there is a lot of baseball and a terrific story about an underdog team that beats the odds by using the odds.
B000021Y7X|5.0|What a wonderful, original, and energizing performance. The Talking Heads can PLAY. The original 4-piece (who enter one at a time, gradually building the concert to a fever pitch by the time of \\"Burning Down the House\\") are joined by additional musicians on percussion, keys and guitar (the excitable Alex Weir on guitar is particularly memorable). The music is flawlessly executed and the excitement is stepped up by some crazy dance steps you'll be copying in your living room. The artistry is deliciously strange, and Jonathan Demme is right on as he directs the show (not showing the audience until the very end is an excellent decision I wish more concert movies would make, and thank goodness this concert precedes the MTV style of concert filming, ie. cutting away to a new camera angle every tenth of a second).<br /><br />But what is truly memorable about \\"Stop Making Sense\\" is its energy, the sheer enjoyment the performers are having onstage. It's infectious and it's delightful and even when you have no idea what the lyrics are about, you'll find yourself singing along anyway while tapping your feet. I grew up listening to this album. Now I'll grow old watching this DVD.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS THE GRANDEST ALBUM OF ALL THE TIME.  FROM THE URBAN BEATS OF \\"I GOT THAT BOOM BOOM\\" TO THE SUBTLE EROTICISM \\"TOUCH OF MY HAND\\", EVERY SONG IS CAREFULLY CRAFTED AND EXTREMELY HOT.  A UNIVERSIALLY PRAISED MASTERPIECE FOR THE AGES.
B000002KN8|4.0|the sound of this record is very particular, may be a little precarius, but you can see right there the talent and the sign of the band.  <br />this album is very enjoyable!
B000056H7W|4.0|As someone who has been looking to get into the heavy metal genre a bit more, this is a great place to start. There's some Steven Wilson (of Porcupine Tree) influence and collaboration, which I also enjoyed. Right now, I love this album, but I have a feeling I won't look back on this album as much more as a transition album.
B000021YQV|5.0|This album is awesome! I love this CD! It's one of my fav CDs of all-time! Here's my track ratings: <br /> <br />Prison Song: 9/10- Great beginner! Great song! <br /> <br />Needles: 9/10- I like this song! It's pretty heavy, but the lyrics are stupid. <br /> <br />Deer Dance: 8/10- Cool song. Sounds just like a bunch of noise, though. <br /> <br />Jet Pilot: 8/10- Cool song. Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot? One who smiled when he flew over the bay? Stupid lyrics! <br /> <br />X: 7/10- Pretty cool. Sounds just like a bunch of noise. Not much of a point in this song. <br /> <br />Chop Suey: 10/10- Best SOAD song ever! Great all the way through with a beautiful ending! One of my favorite songs! <br /> <br />Bounce: 9/10- Great song! A good song to bob your head to! This song doesn't really have a point, though. <br /> <br />Forest: 9/10- One of SOAD's best songs! I love this song! <br /> <br />ATWA: 10/10- I don't know why people don't like this song! This is a great song! <br /> <br />Science: 9/10- Great song! Nice and fast-paced! <br /> <br />Shimmy: 10/10- I love this song! This song has great lyrics! Don't be late for school again! <br /> <br />Toxicity: 9/10- Awesome song! Not one of my favs though. Good message. <br /> <br />Psycho: 8/10- Not that bad. A little slow, but still all right. <br /> <br />Ariels: 10/10- Awesome song! Very heavy at second chorus! You will love this song! <br /> <br />Arto: 5/10- A good Native American tribal song. A waste of CD, though. <br /> <br />Overall, this CD is AWESOME! Buy it Today!!!!!!!!!!
B0009SS00A|1.0|If \\"God-awful\\" is one word instead of two, then I can summarize this book in a single word.
B0006399FS|4.0|We live in a world of extremes and blatant contradictions.  Such confusion and, at times, anarchy, extends from the broadest perspective of the social spectrum right down into the very minds and hearts of most individual human beings.  In fact, it's the unsettled nature of the individual that causes the unsettled nature of the society.<br /><br />Embracing the contradictions inherent in our humanity is what U2 is all about.  The understand well that man is a fallen creature, yet at the same time, each person is created in the image of God and therefore has a spark of eternity in their hearts.  Whether or not one agrees with their worldview or even their expressed philosophy and theology, one must agree that the band has a fierce and passionate commitment to their ethic, and they have stayed true to it for more than 25 years.<br /><br />So far, this review is sounding more like a thesis, isn't it?  By now, a few of the more attention-challenged readers have already scrolled past it or angrily indicated their displeasure with me.<br /><br />But the truth is, few of us have the patience to carefully study or digest or thoughtfully consider anything anymore.  This is reflected in many ways; here on Amazon, it shows up in the plethora of 1-star and 5-star reviews.  Very quick, snap judgements get made, and effusive praise is issued or damning vitriol is spewed.  Extremes.<br /><br />Another indicator is in the number of reviewers who are quick to dismiss U2's latest, \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" as a dud.  One recent reviewer laughably tries to establish his credibility based solely upon the fact that he likes certain \\"hip\\" artists.  I like some of those artists also, and I have virtually every CD they have ever released.  That really doesn't give me any more or less credibility than anyone else.  What we are talking about here is U2, and each review, like each album, should be judged on the merits of its truth, relevance, and helpfulness.  (That same negative reviewer also managed to post his review twice, and asserted that some of the songs on the CD were actually pretty good--why then the 1-star rating?)<br /><br />As for the actual CD itself, it is very good; at times, brilliant.  But other than a few of the obvious songs (\\"Vertigo,\\" \\"City of Blinding Lights,\\" \\"All Because of You\\"), this is not an instantly accessable album.  As some reviewers have indicated, it really takes a few spins for the CD to grow on the listener.<br /><br />But keep on listening, because gradually it begans to dawn on you that this is a very moving, deeply personal, richly felt release that alternately rocks and swings and soothes and heals and comforts and challenges.  What can I say any more wonderful about \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own\\" than some of the things that have already been written here?  It is an emotional and aural tour de force.  The visceral impact of the song is both thrilling and devastating.<br /><br />\\"Original of the Species\\" is also a very powerful personal song.  It obviously comes out of a deep place, and it's beautifully done.  I will say that I love \\"Vertigo\\" with its killer buzzsaw guitar work by The Edge and thunderous throbbing bass from Adam Clayton (who is getting better and better with age); and as for Larry Mullen, Jr, he offers further proof that he is simply the best drummer in rock and roll.<br /><br />\\"Miracle Drug\\" is pleasant, though maybe not the most memorable song that U2 has ever done.  \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" is a bit of anonymous growly sludge.  The rest of the CD is pretty much excellent, though maybe not on the level of \\"The Joshua Tree.\\"  One exception is the closer, \\"Yahweh,\\" which captures the grandeur, joy, and epic sweep of earlier triumphs like \\"Where the Streets Have No Name.\\"<br /><br />So, while I can't say this is U2's *best ever* album, I do believe it's exceptionally good, and is one of the best CDs released in 2005.  For many artists, it would be a 5-star triumph.  For U2, it's a stellar album and evidence that their fire still burns bright.5-star triumph.

B0000CFW87|5.0|When I first heard Josh sining \\"To Where You Are\\", he took my breath away.  He has a way of touching the listener with his voice that no other singer can.  I instantly became a fan, and found this CD in my Dad's collection at work (How he had managed to hide the singer who would one day become my NUMBER ONE FAVORITE is beyond me)  It is, without a doubt, the best CD I own.  My most played, my most loved, my most cherished.  If you've never experienced Josh, than this is the album for you (better, in my opinion, than the first, though both are wonderful.  This one doesn't get \\"old\\", for lack of a better word, as fast). <br /> <br />If you're looking for someone who's more than just a talented singer, this album shows a bit more of Josh's personal side (hense the title \\"Closer\\")  He co-wrote the music and lyrics to three of the songs with a group called \\"Deep Forest\\", and in one of those three, \\"Remember When It Rained\\", he plays the melody on the piano.  If you've seen his \\"Live at the Greek\\" DVD concert, you'll know that he not only plays more of the piano with the live songs, but he also spices up \\"Canto Alla Vita\\" with a drum solo.  And if you've been able to see him in concert?  Let me tell you, it's a night (or nights!) you'll NEVER forget.  The best two concerts of my life. <br /> <br />In the 12 tracks, he sings in 4 different languages (Italian, English, Spanish, and French).  With many artists of this genere, some of the songs can almost blend together with how similar they sound.  This isn't the case with \\"Closer\\".  Each song has it's own mood and feel, and leaves no desire unsatisfied.  <br /> <br />In short, I really can't suggest a better CD than this.  Period.  Out of every CD on Amazon.  I've heard a lot of singers, and am a fan of many, but Josh Groban?  Josh tops them all.  And \\"Closer\\" is his best album yet.

The author seems to have abundant knowledge regarding the behavior of autistic children. It appears that he has writen a captivating story that educates as well as entertains.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|First I have to say that this CD changed my life... :) <br />Truly, it was fate to have this CD bought. It startet with their Videoclip \\"Nemo\\" (Once/ Track 3) which I have seen every time I turned my television on! After I have gotten their album, I was thinking very much about this work. Every track on it included a story, which can be found only by yourself. Of course, it is always nice, if you can identify you in a music. After one and a half year later (NOW!) I found out, that the Album \\"Once\\" is much different from the other productions of Mastermind Toumas Holopainen. Tarja (Vocals) sings now in a different style but the ideas of songs are not lost. I'm sure there is any title on it you like! F. e. : \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\" is like indianic style, \\"Planet Hell\\" is rocking all the way with it's power in it or \\"Higher than Hopes\\", which was written to remember a Nightwish fan who died in 2003. Many critics are saying that \\"Once\\" has just been made of commercial aspects. I think they are just humans and want to become more than the best band of the world :)   At the end I just can tell you, that this CD is much more than a music you can listen at work or just to have some sound. It needs time to get all titles into your mind. But if you got it, you can't leave the world of Tuomas'Skills! Also I'm sure, you want to buy the other albums of Nightwish because you can't leave this music style.
0385510438|4.0|A writer's maxim: \\"Write what you know.\\" I enjoy Grisham's pure legal thrillers mostly as good page-turners with inside dope on the law. He apparently didn't spend that much of his life being a lawyer, and it's not what he knows best. Small-town Southern life is.<br /><br />\\"The Last Juror\\" returns to the scene of my favorite Grisham, his first, \\"A Time To Kill.\\" I like Grisham better when he colors in his books with Southern life, as he does with these and \\"A Painted House\\", than in his relatively two-dimensional legal thrillers.<br /><br />Other critics here fault this book for meandering. I don't see it that way. What's fine here is his portrayal of life in Clanton, Mississippi, with its eccentric characters, peculiar ways and intense, insular community life. You can taste it and smell it. The central plot element, a brutal rape and murder committed by a scion of an insular local crime family, serves to tie it all together, but at the end of the day, is secondary. This is really a coming-of-age tale about a college dropout, Willie Traynor, who finds himself and grows up after borrowing money from his rich grandmother to buy a failing local weekly.<br /><br />True, some elements never get neatly tied up. At the end you realize the plot wasn't really the star.<br /><br />Traynor, like most Grisham protagonists, has little family. But we never really find out much about the eccentric father from whom he is estranged, nor does anything develop there. We never find out who murders a key witness in the trial. Traynor never finds true love, despite musing about it constantly. And a tense subplot involving a black teenager on the run after dallying with the wife of a white cop is resolved in an offhand manner.<br /><br />What's good here is the character development. You watch Traynor learn newspapering on the fly, grappling with desegregation, local justice, corruption and Vietnam. Traynor develops a friendship with an older black woman, the mother of seven PhDs and the sort of \\"credit to her race\\" needed to anchor the newspaper's first feature stories on black people. Through her eyes he develops a fuller understanding of the town. The lunches they eat constitute an assault of mouthwatering Southern cooking armed by her inexhaustible garden and flanked by desserts of innumerable kinds of cake and pie.<br /><br />Grisham's sense of small-town newspapering is reasonably strong. A small town editor may run a one-man show, personally cranking out a dozen or two stories each week just to fill the paper. He churns the lightest fluff to do so. In a small town, folks love the fluff, as it's about themselves and their friends. (Or enemies.)<br /><br />The ending fails to surprise. The twist was so obvious I thought a second twist would lie beneath it. But this book isn't about neatly tying up one particular crime, even one which concatenates through a decade of the town's life. It's a slice of time and place - a town which changes as good ole boys start growing pot and other good ole boys start smoking it; where the sons of patriotic veterans sour on a seemingly endless war; where a corrupt family begins losing its century-old grip; where schools begin to desegregate; where big-box stores erode downtown business and town-square life; where racial issues aren't solved in a minute but neither devolve into lynchings or cross burnings. Clanton begins easing into the future, as Traynor himself does. Unlike Grisham's many disillusioned young lawyers, Traynor doesn't hate what he does by book's end nor toss it into the dust Gary Cooper-style. He doesn't open a secret bank account in the Cayman Islands. He's just ready to move on.<br /><br />It has the feel of real life, ending when this phase of Traynor's life ends, not when every mystery gets solved. Life's mysteries rarely do.n PhDs and the sort of \\"credit to her race\\" needed to anchor the newspaper's first feature stories on black people.

B00002E23E|4.0|I made the mistake of buying the newest DVD before this one.  There is no comparison.  I was used to hearing these tracks from the album of the same name, and the movie format it is unedited, usually a good thing.  But I found the sound track fading in and out at the most inopportune times.  No Quarter from the album has the most riveting organ and guitar solo, but it must have been filmed on a different night for the film, because it is shorter and lacks bravado.  Yes, the fantasy sequences are a bit dated and cheesy but that comes with the territory of the film and when it was made.  Overall it is still good but nothing compares to the newest DVD for live musical content.   <br /> <br />A must for any Zep fan to have.    <br />
0767817729|5.0|I have seen this film repeatedly and honestly how often do you see a movie that is compelling from beginning to end. Its racy, violent, passionate and moving all wrapped into one. I felt an understanding of the love, pain, betrayal and yes the need for revenge. It was entertaining and an epic portrayal of love and pain. I own this on VHS and DVD just so I never run out of viewing options. Buy this its well worth it.

1573223026|2.0|Let's see...I really liked High Fidelity and About A Boy was also good. I thought How to be Good was somewhat readable. Why not give the 4th Hornby oeuvre a wary, but honest  try? Take four  characters (including - guess what - a trash-talking teen girl and a failed rock musician), a lot of \\"cute\\" writing about 'puke' and the expected 'f' word,  a couple of contemporaneous references to the politics of George Bush and Tony Blair,  endless repetition of narrative and what is left? Not much to recommend.There are lots of improbable vignettes,the sorriest of which (no, not the intended New Year's Eve leap off the building) concerns an intervention brought off in the basement of a Starbucks. This is a pantheon of hokey, jokey characters. Even Maureen, whose life is filled with genuine pathos,not just the tedious whinging of the other 3 mediocrities,has been infused with scant depth by Hornby. This book pushed me over the edge. Nick can do better.

B000002N3J|4.0|Many of Madonna's strengths as a songwriter and vocalist are showcased in this compilation of ballads, some previously unreleased.  The most surprising of the new material is her cover of \\"I Want You,\\" which surprisingly holds its own when compared to Marvin Gaye's masterful original.  The Latin-tinged hit single \\"You'll See\\" (#6 Pop, #5 Adult Contemporary) instantly became one of Madonna's best-loved ballads, and it features one of her best vocal performances.  The acoustic-sounding \\"One More Try\\" is also a favorite of mine, probably because the stripped down production places the emphasis on her voice.  This cut really should have been the second single, in my opinion.      The new material helped SOMETHING TO REMEMBER land in the #6 position on the Hot 200, and the well-produced compilation eventually reached Triple-Platinum status in sales.  The previously released material is expertly selected including the big hits (\\"Crazy For You,\\" \\"Live To Tell,\\" \\"Take A Bow\\"), while still giving time to the first-rate modest hits (\\"Rain,\\" \\"Oh Father\\") and lesser-known album tracks (the title track, \\"Forbidden Love\\").  The smash hit soundtrack cuts \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" and \\"I'll Remember\\" also make their first appearances on a Madonna album.  Every track is presented in it's original album version, which is usually the definite version, although it would have been nice to have had the video mix of \\"Rain\\" included.      The non-chronological sequencing of the songs doesn't bother me since this is a specialty compilation and not a singles anthology.  The only faulty selection is a remix of the early track \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" (#78 Pop, #16 Dance) which doesn't sit well with the other material (personally, I think either \\"Promise To Try\\" or \\"Inside Of Me\\" would have been much better alternatives).  This is easily forgivable though, when considering the multitude of treasures this chest contains.
B0002BO0AS|3.0|Before you skip over this review because it's not another \\"OMG WOWZORZ THIS ALBUM PWNZ!\\" review, hear me out. I'll admit I'm not a huge metalcore fan, but I am a fan of giving all music a chance and judging it with an unbiased ear. I'm not afraid to admit this album has its moments; it's just that Unearth seems to follow the \\"metalcore pattern\\" for the most part, recycling old riffs, vocal styles, and song structures.     That's not to say the whole album isn't worth listening to, it just feels like an average release, by a fairly average cookie cutter band. You have your generic screaming, your double kick and snare roll with fills, and you have your chord that is played fast and then played slow a little while later. I heard a lot of hype saying these guys were amazing live, and I was interested to see them at \\"Sounds of the Underground\\" this year to see what kid of show they put on. They definitely had some energy, but after already enduring 6 or 7 metalcore bands before them, (I was at the show for Strapping Young Lad, Opeth, Gwar, and Lamb of God mostly) they seemed like every other band that had already hit the stage. (Although Endless, off this album, got the crowd whipped into quiet the circle pit) The metalcore sound seems to have stagnated to a generic pattern that sure, worked for a while, but to become truly special in the music world, you have to come up with something completely different and unique.    Everybody has heard that special album that really sucks them in and takes them by surprise that you experience instead of listen to. I'll search for that feeling anywhere, but it seems like I've come up a little short this time. Rare is the album that is so revolutionary and perfect that you cannot judge the music, but rather be captivated and experience every movement with awe and wonder. (My first feeling of that sort was Opeth) If you're looking for a hard, heavy, metalcore release this will be for you; (although it may only be two progressions different from the last release you bought) Just don't expect anything you haven't heard before.
B000002LCD|1.0|While it's not quite as horrid as the film of the same name, the WHO'S THAT GIRL? soundtrack is still a rather wretched affair.  Due to Madonna's incredible popularity, this disc managed to hit the Hot 200's Top Ten and reach Platinum status in sales, but it's far from a must-own now.  Madonna contributes four tracks, and they all sound like TRUE BLUE out-takes.  <br /> <br />Madonna wrote the big hit \\"Who's That Girl?\\" (#1 Pop, #5 Adult Contemporary, #44 Dance) with Patrick Leonard, and it's a virtual rewrite of their own superior \\"La Isla Bonita.\\"  The wistful ballad \\"The Look of Love\\" (also co-written with Leonard) is less derivative, but much more ordinary.  The frantic, Steve Bray-produced dance track \\"Causing A Commotion\\" (#2 Pop, #1 Dance) fares much better, and is an undervalued gem in Madonna's singles catalogue.   <br /> <br />The only other Madonna cut (the generic \\"Can't Stop,\\" also produced and co-written by Bray) is an obvious throwaway, yet it is still better than any of the other non-Madonna tracks.  The remaining cuts are by other \\"artists\\" (I use that term loosely) and are anonymous and unlistenable.  There's a reason why Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi never went anywhere.

B00005J6SZ|4.0|A monster smash when released, LIKE A VIRGIN shot straight to #1 on the Hot 200 and has been certified Platinum 10 times over in the US alone.  It remains Madonna's best-selling studio album in the US to date.  This is easily Madonna's most fondly-remembered recording, and, although it's not quite as consistent as her debut, LIKE A VIRGIN is the album that made her a icon.  The title track is still Madonna's second biggest hit (#1 Pop, #29 Adult Contemporary, #1 Dance), and it's still a catchy kitsch classic.  The second smash hit \\"Material Girl\\" (#2 Pop, #1 Dance) is a silly, but endearing stab at the nation's materialism, with Madonna's comically snippy vocals making the whole thing memorable.  Unfortunately, the song branded her with a nickname she has yet to completely shake. <br /> <br />Even though it was a Top Five hit, no one really seems to remember \\"Angel\\" (#5 Pop, #5 Adult Contemporary, #1 Dance), the light-weight third hit.  The massively popular non-single \\"Into The Groove\\" was placed on the B-side of \\"Angel,\\" and sent sales of the single through the roof.  Warner Brothers arguably made a mistake by not releasing \\"Groove\\" as the A-side of the single (it certainly would have hit #1, as it did in the U.K.), however, \\"Angel\\" is still a slinky, if slightly forgettable, pop nugget.  The fourth and final single, the irresistible \\"Dress You Up\\" (#5 Pop, #3 Dance), was also an unstoppable smash, despite being inexplicably included on Tipper Gore's \\"Filthy Fifteen\\" list.  I'm not sure what Mrs. Gore found so offensive in the rather innocent-minded lyrics, but the song has a killer hook that makes such discussions seem pointless. <br /> <br />Madonna was still co-writing heavily with Steve Bray at this point, and two of the album tracks they composed, \\"Over And Over\\" and \\"Stay,\\" are actually stronger than the aforementioned \\"Angel\\" (which was also a Madonna-Bray composition).  The jubilant \\"Over And Over\\" became a fan favorite over the years, and it plays like awarm-up to later Madonna-Bray masterpieces like 1985's \\"Into The Groove\\" or 1989's \\"Express Yourself.\\"  Madonna also sounds very impassioned on the closing \\"Stay,\\" which is perhaps Madonna's best album track from this period.  While these are the only true standouts that the albums offers, Nile Rodgers' slick production makes even the standard-issue filler (\\"Pretender,\\" \\"Shoo-be-doo\\") sound well-crafted and enjoyable.  The only real low point is her cover of Rolls Royce's \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore,\\" which proves that Madonna had yet to perfect her craft of delivering ballads.   <br /> <br />LAV is 100% pure fun, and even though she has done better work elsewhere, this is the record that the phenomenon known as Madonna will always be remembered for.  As with her debut album, the majority of Madonna's vocals were mechanically altered to sound more high-pitched and girlish, which actually gives the material even more charm.  I think the album would have been improved even further if it had been re-issued with her sountrack hits from `85 (\\"Crazy For You,\\" the aforementioned \\"Into The Groove\\") as bonus tracks, but what's here is the ultimate in mid-eighties trashy synth pop.  This album, more than any other, really captures the spirit of the pop scene of late `84, and it will always hold a special place in my heart for nostalgic reasons.  It has that terrific cover photo too! <br /> <br />NOTE:  In 1985, Madonna made a cameo appearance as a night club singer in the film Vision Quest, and sang two songs.  One of which, \\"Crazy For You\\" (#1 Pop, #2 Adult Contemporary), became an enormous hit.  The other VISION QUEST song, the driving up-tempo stomper \\"Gambler,\\" is a fun dance track that is very much in the mold of her early hits.  As of this writing, \\"Gambler\\" has yet to appear on any of Madonna's proper LPs.  Also in 1985, Madonna made an impressive acting debut in the comedy DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN, and contributed the song \\"Into The Groove\\" to the film's soundtrack.  Co-written with Steve Bray, \\"Into The Groove\\" is the ultimate Madonna dance track.  The song was a massive radio hit, but Sire/Warner didn't want to issue the song as a single (they were wanted to only push songs that were on the then-current LIKE A VIRGIN album), so the very popular \\"Into The Groove\\" was only available as the B-side of the \\"Angel\\" single.  It was largely due to \\"Groove's\\" appeal that barely-remembered \\"Angel\\" leaped into the Top 5.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|In November of 2000, The Beatles released their 33rd album entitled, 1. The album contains all of The Beatles' number one hits from 1963 to 1970. This album is absolutely worth your time and money. I know you have all these songs, whether on the albums, compilation albums, or singles. But owning all of the number one hits on one CD is just for you. <br /> <br />LOVE ME DO <br />  From the album PLEASE PLEASE ME (1963). One of the best. <br /> <br />FROM ME TO YOU <br />  From the single release of FROM ME TO YOU (1963). Great. <br /> <br />SHE LOVES YOU <br />  From the album THE BEATLES' SECOND ALBUM (1964). Gotta love this song. <br /> <br />I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND <br />  From the re-release album MEET THE BEATLES (1964). Remember that the MEET THE BEATLES album is the American-ized version of the WITH THE BEATLES album, only this song never appeared on WITH THE BEATLES, but on MEET THE BEATLES. Great song. <br /> <br />CAN'T BUY ME LOVE <br />  From the album A HARD DAY'S NIGHT (1964). Awesome song. <br /> <br />A HARD DAY'S NIGHT <br />  From the album A HARD DAY'S NIGHT (1964). Awesome. <br /> <br />I FEEL FINE <br />  From the single release of I FEEL FINE (1964). One of the greatest, where it stands as the only rock & roll song with feedback recorded onto the song intentionally. <br /> <br />EIGHT DAYS A WEEK <br />  From the album BEATLES FOR SALE (1965). Great song. <br /> <br />TICKET TO RIDE <br />  From the album HELP! (1965). Awesome. <br /> <br />HELP! <br />  From the album HELP! (1965). Great song. <br /> <br />YESTERDAY <br />  From the album HELP! (1965). Great song, and the most recorded song in music history. <br /> <br />DAY TRIPPER <br />  From the single release of DAY TRIPPER (1965). Not one of my favorites. <br /> <br />WE CAN WORK IT OUT <br />  From the album YESTERDAY...AND TODAY (1966). One of my all-time favorites. <br /> <br />PAPERBACK WRITER <br />  From the single release of PAPERBACK WRITER (1966). Not one of my favorites. <br /> <br />YELLOW SUBMARINE <br />  From the album REVOLVER (1966). Great song, especially for the kids, which is why Ringo calls it the Kiddie Song. <br /> <br />ELEANOR RIGBY <br />  From the album REVOLVER (1966). This is my all-time favorite song off of the REVOLVER album, with the second being \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\". <br /> <br />ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE <br />  From the album MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (1967). Great song. <br /> <br />HELLO, GOODBYE <br />  From the album MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (1967). Great. <br /> <br />LADY MADONNA <br />  From the single release of LADY MADONNA (1968). Great song. <br /> <br />HEY JUDE <br />  From the single release of HEY JUDE (1968). Later included on the album HEY JUDE (THE BEATLES AGAIN) (1970). The best Beatles song ever. <br /> <br />GET BACK <br />  From the album LET IT BE (1970). Great song. <br /> <br />THE BALLAD OF JOHN AND YOKO <br />  From the album HEY JUDE (THE BEATLES AGAIN) (1970). This was known as The Yoko Song. I call it The IT Song because Yoko is not a human, for she is an IT because of her hideousness. <br /> <br />SOMETHING <br />  From the album ABBEY ROAD (1969). Great. <br /> <br />COME TOGETHER <br />  From the album ABBEY ROAD (1969). Great song. <br /> <br />LET IT BE <br />  From the album LET IT BE (1970). Great song. <br /> <br />THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD <br />  From the album LET IT BE (1970). A beautiful ballad. <br /> <br />    This album will ever you listening to it over and over again, for it features nothing but the best of The Beatles' number one hits from their entire career. 1 is a great album and for you to buy right now.
B000002NJS|4.0|Possibly the most ballyhooed release of her career, the elcontronica-driven RAY OF LIGHT was being heralded as \\"ground breaking\\" months before the recording even hit stores.  When the release date for RAY OF LIGHT finally did come, I think most honest fans and critics discovered that the press had made too much of the whole electronica issue.  Despite all of the electronic blurbs and gurgles, RAY OF LIGHT sounds less like a Chemical Brothers release and more like a regular Madonna album - albeit a first-rate one.  RAY OF LIGHT features some of Madonna's catchiest hooks and strongest songwriting yet, delivered with a stable and inventive (if a little gimmicky) production courtesy of William Orbit.   <br /> <br />Light also finds Madonna writing with Pat Leonard for the first time in four years, and their collaborations - including \\"Skin,\\" the flop single \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" (#93 Pop, #1 Dance), \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" (#41 Dance), and the big hit \\"Frozen\\" (#2 Pop, #8 Adult Contemporary, #1 Dance) - provide some of the finest moments on the album.  However, the album's best track (\\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\\") was co-written with producer Orbit.  Though I find the busy title track (#5 Pop, #1 Dance) to be one of the least successful Madonna-Orbit collaborations, it was also a big hit as a single.  RAY OF LIGHT also features three solid ballads co-written with frequent Stevie Nicks-collaborator Rick Nowels, including the gorgeous hit \\"The Power Of Goodbye\\" (#11 Pop, #14 Adult Contemporary).   <br /> <br />The only complaint I have with the album is Madonna's vocals, which is what ironically drew the most praise from critics and fans.  Her voice now has more range and control, but unfortunately she often seems detached from the material.  No matter how lovely she may sound, there are times I can't help but miss the yearning rasp that was one of the most identifiable characteristics of her voice.  However, this is only a minor quibble and doesn't prevent RAY OF LIGHT from being one of the best albums of the late `90s.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|In November of 2003, The Beatles' released their 34th and most recent album to date, LET IT BE...NAKED. This album is really no different from the 1970 release of LET IT BE, as far as the songs selection goes. The difference is, however, in the sound of the songs. The songs have been mixed a little bit sort of Di-Spectorized, if you will, making the album a remix album for the guys, in a manner. <br /> <br />GET BACK <br />  Awesome. <br /> <br />DIG A PONY <br />  Incredible. <br /> <br />FOR YOU BLUE <br />  Great. <br /> <br />THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD <br />  Paul McCartney was rather pissed at Phil Spector for adding the choir vocals to this song. I think the choir vocals made the song sound amazingly beautiful, no offense to Paul McCartney's work. After all, Sir McCartney, you are my favorite Beatle. <br /> <br />TWO OF US <br />  Great. <br /> <br />I'VE GOT A FEELING <br />  I love how both Paul and John have their own parts to sing in the lead. <br /> <br />ONE AFTER 909 <br />  Always was a favorite of mine. <br /> <br />DON'T LET ME DOWN <br />  From the album HEY JUDE (THE BEATLES AGAIN) (1970). Why they put this song on here is beyond me. <br /> <br />I ME MINE <br />  Great George song. <br /> <br />ACROSS THE UNIVERSE <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />LET IT BE <br />  Amazing. <br /> <br />    There are two songs missing from here and they are \\"Dig It\\" & \\"Maggie Mae\\", but this collection is still as strong-sounding as it was when it was first released in 1970. If you want to buy this album and declare yourself the owner of every single Beatles album, then go ahead and, in the words of NIKE, \\"Just Do It\\"!
B00005Q66T|4.0|This compilation of Madonna's hits from 1992-2001 does the right thing by including all the official single edits/album versions, and is almost sequenced in chronological order, with only a few tracks presented out of the proper sequence.  The majority of the material that Madonna released during the second decade of her career is first-rate, and the breadth and consistency among the included tracks is quite stunning.  The compilation is very well-balanced between both ballads (\\"Take a Bow,\\" \\"The Power of Good-bye\\") and hardcore dance (\\"Deeper and Deeper,\\" \\"Music\\"), all of which sit together with remarkable comfort on the same disc.  As an added bonus, the delightful \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" finally makes it's first appearance on a Madonna record.    If there is a downside, it would be exclusion of several classic singles.  The missing Top 40 hits (not covered on 1995's ballad compilation SOMETHING TO REMEMBER) include the sophisticated \\"Bad Girl,\\" the Gold-selling single \\"You Must Love Me,\\" and the soundtrack cut \\"American Pie.\\"  Also, it's worth noting that \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\" can't help but seem jarringly out of place next to the other, modern tracks.  I realize that \\"Argentina\\" was a Top Ten hit for Madonna, but the previously-mentioned \\"You Must Love Me\\" or the dance hit \\"Buenos Aires\\" would have made better EVITA selections.      Some fans may lament the fact that there is no previously unreleased material (couldn't she have included a live cut from the \\"Drowned World\\" tour, an exclusive remix, or something?), but the non-stop stream of hits are so appealing that this becomes easily forgiven.  GHV2 debuted at lucky #7 on the Hot 200, but the lack of new hit caused the album to fall off the charts after only 18 weeks.  The disc was able to reach Platinum status, but it became the first Madonna album since 1987's forgettable YOU CAN DANCE not to be certified multi-platinum during it's initial chart run.  However, GHV2 will almost undoubtedly continue to sell strongly over the years as the material it contains is so tremendous and its fantastic to finally have it all in one place.
B000AARKO4|5.0|The movie is a master piece. It has got to be the best medieval type movie I have ever seen. It is fairly accurate on most accounts in portraying Saladin, and the Franks (European Crusaders). Orlando Bloom in my opinion pulled this film off very well. It was a major undertaking for any actor playing a lead in this, and shows his talent.<br /><br /> One thing I kind of disliked was how the Templars were shown in this film. The movie showed them as blood thirsty psychopathic killers who would go out and slaughter innocents at the whim of a mad man (or \\"God wills it\\") While the Franks were the more blood thirsty of the Crusader wars, the Templars were one of the orders who actually tried to get along with their Muslim neighbors and even adopted many of their customs. And the Templars were not known to throw away their Knights so carelessly.<br /><br /> Other than that small gripe, this film is a must see. I would recommend renting the theater version on DVD/VHS and buying the extended version (DVD 4 disc) coming out. That there were many parts cut in this film to shrink down the running time is apparent, I feel that the extended version with all the left out scenes will add a lot more to an already fantastic movie.
B00005J6T1|4.0|Madonna's self-titled first album is still an under appreciated recording that she has rarely been able to match.  As fans (both casual and fanatical) often point out, Madonna's singing voice is notably thinner and more transparent on her early recordings with an almost non-existent range.  It should also be noted that the pitch of Madonna's vocals were mechanically altered on this album (as well as the next recording) to sound more girlish, however this actually works with the material rather than against it.  Actually, these early, vocally-limited performances best project her personality and charm - qualities that are unfortunately missing from many of her later recordings.   <br /> <br />The low budget production actually helps give many of the songs a raw, stripped-down feeling (acoustic dance music?), which keeps the album from sounding dated.   In retrospect, \\"Everybody\\" (#3 Dance), \\"Burning Up\\" (#3 Dance) and \\"Physical Attraction\\" (the B-side to \\"Burning Up,\\" which became just as popular as the A-side) sound more like usual rock songs than the over-produced disco tunes that would have been dead on arrival in 1983.  As far as the pop hits are concerned - \\"Holiday\\" (#16 Pop, #1 Dance), \\"Borderline\\" (#10 Pop, #4 Dance), and \\"Lucky Star\\" (#4 Pop, #1 Dance) have remained as enduringly fresh as the day they were recorded.   <br /> <br />The remaining two tracks (the only ones that weren't released as singles in some format) are also worthy, if not as meticulously produced.  This album was a real sleeper hit, finally reaching the Hot 200's Top Ten a full year after it's release!  It eventually peaked at #8 and has since reached a very impressive Quintuple-Platinum status in sales.  MADONNA also spent a whopping 168 weeks on the Hot 200, more weeks than any of Madonna's other albums.
0553573403|5.0|Let me say that I started out at the age of 11, reading the Lord of the Rings. Someone should have told me to wait a few more years, because it was all downhill from there. Eddings, Terry Brooks, Goodkind, Robert Jordan -- they all draw heavily from Tolkein and thereby become \\"fantasy through the eyes of this author after he read LOTR.\\"<br /><br />I stopped reading the Wheel of Time after finishing the 150(!) page prologue of Book Five and having no idea what the heck is going on. I cracked open Brooks' Jerle re-hash and it almost put me to sleep. I felt as though my love of fantasy had lived and died with Tolkein, so I moved on. Then a couple of my co-workers insisted I check out Ice and Fire.<br /><br />So I did, and it was slow, and  I was hundreds of pages in, and there appeared to be no over-arching plot line -- just political intrigue. However, the characters were very well defined, particularly Tyrion Lannister, who's like the Jeremy Piven of this series. There wasn't silly magic all over the place, no cheesy prophecy, no obvious Messiah character, no browbeating portents of supernatural doom, no Gandalfian mentor, no Font of Dark Evil nemesis -- in other words, Ice and Fire is more like historical Medieval fiction than genre exercise, and cripes, and hadn't realized how much the genre needed classical drama until I read this.<br /><br />There is profanity, sexual situations involving minors, gruesome depictions of violence, ribald humor, et cetera, so it's not for the little ones. Not that they'd want to dip into an 800+ page paperback novel. This thing is a doorstop. But like I said, even though the main plot arc is glacial, it's a pleasure to read because the characters feel like *people* and locations feel like *places*. He creates vibrantly different cultures, despicable (but not generically evil) characters, and a nuanced narrative that is obviously the product of his having been around the block more than a few times.<br /><br />If The Game of Thrones doesn't deserve five stars, I don't know what fantasy novel does. Unlike other fantasy novelists I could name, I really get the impression that Martin respects his audience and is not out to milk them, despite the fact that this series is supposed to be six novels in length.Thrones doesn't deserve five stars, I don't know what fantasy novel does.

B000002NAK|3.0|With so many highlights, why does the soundtrack to Madonna's greatest screen performance always feel slightly disappointing after a listen?  This a problem common with most of Andrew Lloyd Webber's work:  many good individual songs that fail to make a cohesive show.  Webber is a composer many theater enthusiasts (i.e. snobs) hate because he writes theater songs as if they were pop radio hits.   <br /> <br />While he's no match for intellectual brilliance of Sondheim (though neither is any other modern composer), I personally love many of the songs Webber has composed - from \\"Memory\\" (from CATS) to \\"The Music of the Night\\" (from THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA) as well as many others - however, I seldom like his plays when taken as whole.  The same goes for EVITA:  even though the album is full of great tracks, it really doesn't gel into a completely satisfying unit.   <br /> <br />But that doesn't really matter in the end, because most listeners will be justifiably thrilled with Madonna's impressive vocal performance.  Madonna gives the definite renditions of \\"Buenos  Aires\\" (#3 Dance), \\"High Flying, Adored,\\" \\"Another Suitcase In Another Hall,\\" and \\"Rainbow High,\\" however she sounds a little shaky on \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\" (#8 Pop, #21 Adult Contemporary, #1 Dance).  Maybe it was because \\"Argentina\\" is such a well-known number, but, for whatever reason, Madonna sounds nervous in her delivery.   <br /> <br />This is forgivable, however, thanks to her other stunning song renditions, including the newly written, Gold-selling \\"You Must Love Me\\" (#18 Pop, #15 Adult Contemporary), which ranks as one of her best singles.  The public supported Madonna's labor of love by sending the double-disc set to #2 on the Hot 200.  Impressively, the album achieved Quintuple-Platinum status in sales, making it Madonna's most successful album of the nineties.  It may not be the masterpiece it strived to be, but the EVITA soundtrack is one of Madonna's most impressive releases to date. <br /> <br />NOTE:  Of special interest to fans are the two singles that Warner Bros. released to promote the Evita soundtrack, both of which featured alternate versions of both songs.  The single version of \\"You Must Love Me\\" (#18 Pop, #15 Adult Contemporary) features the exact same vocal performance from the soundtrack, but is slightly remixed with a more \\"pop\\"-sounding arrangement, including a beautiful new string introduction (the soundtrack cut begins with Madonna singing a cappella).  For the release of the soundtrack's best-known song, the now-standard \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\" (#8 Pop, #21 Adult Contemporary, #1 Dance), Madonna and Warner Bros. surprised everyone (and outraged Weber purists) by releasing a drastically altered remix of the song, entitled the \\"Miami Mix.\\"  The \\"Miami Mix\\" of \\"Argentina\\" transforms the dramatic ballad into a campy dance club epic, and is further boosted by Madonna's rerecorded vocals on the chorus.  I thought Madonna sounded somewhat nervous and quivery on the original ballad version of \\"Argentina,\\" however, she sounds much more confident and impassioned on the \\"Miami Mix\\" remix of the song.  Both of these alternate versions are responsible for getting the singles on the airwaves and landing the songs in the Top 20 on Billboard's Hot 200, and they also contributed to the Multi-Platinum sales and high chart position of the EVITA soundtrack.  Although, ironically, neither remix was actually included on the soundtrack album that they promoted.
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|SUCH A WONDERFUL ALBUM!  I HAVE NEVER HEARD A MORE BEAUTIFUL LOVE SONG, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF JEFFERSON AIRPLANE'S \\"TODAY\\", THAN I HEARD IN HARRISON'S \\"YOUR LOVE IS FOREVER\\".  25 YEARS LATER, IT STILL BRINGS BACK HAUNTING, YET BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES.  THAT IS WHAT MAKES A GREAT ALBUM...AND YES, IT IS ALWAYS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER!
B00000DHRX|4.0|A well done hits compilation, spread across two discs and including some interesting rarities and new songs.  The songs are divided up in non-chronological order, with ballads on one disc and dance tracks on the other.  I personally would have preferred the tracks to have been sequenced chronologically, but the current sequencing is satisfactory, and isolating the dance tracks leaves you with a great party disc.  Just for the record, no songs with Wham are included (\\"Careless Whisper\\" and \\"A Different Corner\\" were released as solo songs), the UK hit \\"Older\\" is missing, and the hit version of \\"I Want Your Sex\\" has been replaced with the \\"Part II\\" reprise of the song.  The remainder of the songs are all presented in their original single versions, which makes it a great buy even if you have all of Michael's proper albums.    The US and UK versions of the compilation have slightly different track listings.  The newly-recorded dance single \\"Outside\\" (#2 UK) is present on both version, but the stirring cover of Stevie Wonder's \\"As\\" (#4 UK), with Mary J. Blige) is only found of the UK issue.  The UK version also includes a 1997 remix of \\"The Strangest Thing\\" and the killer B-side \\"Fantasy,\\" but inexplicably omits the smash hit \\"Monkey,\\" which is on the US version.  Both versions included two generous booklets with lyrics and many beautiful photos of Michael.  Given the inclusion of the few rare tracks, I suggest listeners pick up the UK version (after all, \\"Monkey\\" is easily found on the Faith album).  Either way you go, however, this is a great compilation that includes some of the best pop singles of the eighties and nineties.
B00007FOMP|5.0|Marvin Gaye in the late 60's and early 70's was an important artist in the Motown family. His soulful voice, combined with his passion and energy in his songs, made him a shining star. However, closing in on age 30, he was ready to try something new, expand his artistic vision, something that never ever was done in the Motown factory. Berry Gordy was pretty clear on what he wanted: chart topping, radio playing, record selling hits. He hired singers to sing these songs, and writers to write these songs. The songs were light on meaning, heavy on melody, and always loaded with hooks. Gaye was itching just like the Beatles in the 60's did to move past simple songs. He wanted to write his own material, and sing what was really on his mind. Finally, in the early 1970's, he released \\"What's Going On\\", an album that Gordy was very hesitant in releasing. What ended up happening was history changing. <br /> <br />\\"What's Going On\\" is a concept album, in which Gaye co-wrote and sang songs about many of the issues of concern at the time. The title track deals with his brother Frankie coming home from the Vietnam War and what they thought about the whole war. \\"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology Song)\\" tackles environmental issues that were going on at the time, including the increase in nuclear power. \\"Inner City Blues (Make Me Want to Holler)\\" talked about the increasing problems in the city, with drugs, crime, etc. These three songs hit the Top 20 to the surprise of Gordy, and in the process, it helped other Motown artists (mainly Stevie Wonder) in getting their artistic freedom to try new things with their music. <br /> <br />The music is meaningful, and it makes you think. It's smooth, soulful beat reminds me of walking through a park on Sunday morning. Gaye broke down the doors that all R & B music had to be about fluffy, bubblegum topics and that artists could create their own sound and meaning. Gaye redefined himself as a socially conscious singer/songwriter with this album, andwould later define himself also as a highly romantic artist with \\"Let's Get It On.\\" It helped in sealing the legacy of the late Marvin Gaye. Get a piece of music changing history today.
B000002LLC|3.0|First off, this album is definitely worth owning as it is the only place to get the original mix of the smash \\"Vogue\\" (#1 Pop, #23 Adult Contemporary, #1 Dance), with the original \\"finger-snap/bongo-drum\\" introduction intact.  The version of \\"Vogue\\" that was included on THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION featured a needlessly extended intro (and also dropped some of the killer synth lines), while the single/radio version of the song skipped the introduction all together.  The version featured here (which is the version that was used in the music video) is the definite mix of the classic Shep Pettibone collaboration, and it is arguably THE quintessential Madonna single.  As of this writing, I'M BREATHLESS is still the only album where \\"Vogue\\" can be found in it's original form.    Besides \\"Vogue,\\" the album's other Madonna-written material (the rest co-written with Pat Leonard) is in the form of a pseudo-concept album, attempting to capture the witty dancehall material of the 1930's, as performed by Madonna as DICK TRACY's club chanteuse Breathless Mahoney.  On this level, Madonna demonstrates surprising versatility as both a songwriter and a singer as she whips up a marvelous torch song in \\"He's a Man,\\" a sentimental-yet-simmering ballad with \\"Something to Remember,\\" and goofily brilliant novelty tunes like \\"Back in Business\\" and the single \\"Hanky Panky\\" (#10 Pop).  Sure, the overall sound feels less like 1930's big band and more like Broadway-pop circa 1990, but that's part of the fun.  Of the six Madonna-penned numbers, only \\"Cry Baby\\" fails to engage, and perhaps should have been dropped from the track selection.     The album also contains two songs by co-written Andy Paley, and, although these tracks are in the same vein as the Madonna/Leonard material on the album, they are surprisingly not as much fun.  The Brazilian-flavored \\"I'm Going Bananas\\" is cute enough for it's brief 90-second runtime, although it's meager success stems more from Madonna's uncanny Carmen Miranda impersonation than from the actual number.  Paley's \\"Now I'm Following You\\" is one of only four songs on the album to have actually been featured in the film DICK TRACY (in a version performed by Paley himself, however, not the version on this album sung by Madonna and Warren Beatty), although it's actually rather pedestrian (though harmless) fluff.  The version of the song included on I'M BREATHLESS is given more mileage by some amusing interplay by Madonna and then-current beau Warren Beatty, as well as some humorous production gimmicks in the \\"Part II\\" remix of the song.        Where Madonna really impresses fans, however, is on the three numbers written by Steven Sondheim, unarguably one of the finest songwriters of his generation (the Sondheim tracks are also incidentally the remaining three of this disc's four tracks that actually appear in the film DICK TRACY).  Madonna's studio rendition of the Oscar-winning vamp classic \\"Sooner or Later\\" is sizzling and touching, although I actually prefer the brassier, Monroe-like live performance of the song that Madonna performed on the 63rd Annual Academy Awards.  Madonna also rises to the challenge in delivering some of Sondheim's trademark rapid-fire wordplay on the terrific \\"More,\\" a delightfully satirical number that successfully puts Madonna in the comedic Judy Holiday territory that she has always professed to aspire to as a performer.  Of the Sondheim material, only \\"What Can You Lose\\" fails to completely connect, largely due to the fact that the song is pitched too high for Madonna's low register, and it ends up becoming solo piece for duet partner Mandy Patinkin (albeit, a very pretty one).     Due to the success of \\"Vogue\\" and \\"Hanky Panky,\\" I'M BREATHLESS shot straight to the #2 position on the Hot 200, and managed to achieve Double-Platinum status in sales.  Madonna, in general, was virtually unstoppable in 1990, and this album is a great snapshot of this milestone year for the entertainer.  With the seemingly-constant airplay of the \\"Vogue\\" video and single, her well-received supporting turn in DICK TRACY, and the mammoth BLONDE AMBITION tour (which is still probably her greatest artistic achievement), this was also one of the few times that Madonna was a darling of the critics.  A very good concept recording that finds the diva stretching outside her usual fare and successfully delivering something different, I'M BREATHLESS is good fun.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I didn't mind the \\"new and improved\\" version but, like others, I want to be able to buy the originals - the ones I stood in line to see in the theatres starting back in 1977.  The main thing I really disliked about the additions was that of the young Anakin.  It's just not logical to have the young Anakin standing next to the old Obi-Wan.  If you want to use young Anakin, fine, but you should also use young Ewan McGregor Obi-Wan as well.  And really, since Luke only saw his father when he was dying, he only knew the old Anakin - didn't he wonder who this young kid was standing next to Yoda and old Obi-Wan???  I hated that misstep in continuity!!!
B000002MUW|4.0|After the immense public backlash following the SEX book and the album EROTICA, Madonna made the commercially-wise decision to evolve in her style a little more before releasing her next album.  She decided to continue experimenting with the R&B elements she heavily adopted on EROTICA, however she added a warmer and more humanistic slant to material.  It could be argued that Madonna may have gone a little too far with the conservatism on this release, and (except for perhaps \\"Human Nature\\") she steers clear of any possible controversy.  The disc lacks the hard-hitting sass of EROTICA, but it's so fresh and tuneful that I seriously doubt most listeners will mind.  The album was another success for Madonna, peaking at #3 on the Hot 200 and quickly going Double-Platinum - excellent for an recording artist in the second decade of her career.   <br /> <br />The first single, the sizzling \\"Secret\\" (#3 Pop, #2 Adult Contemporary, #1 Dance), was a smash hit right out of the box, and the gorgeous \\"Take A Bow\\" (#1 Pop, #1 Adult Contemporary) remains the most successful single of Madonna's career.  The Bjork-penned semi-title track \\"Bedtime Story\\" (#42 Pop, #1 Dance) was an adventurous choice for a single, but it received virtually no airplay and became Madonna's first song to fail to reach the Top 40.  That's a shame, because it's as daring and creative a song as any mainstream artist released in the `90s.  I personally find the album's fourth single, the bitingly funny \\"Human Nature\\" (#46 Pop, #2 Dance), to be the disc's weakest number, however, it too is well crafted and blends into the rest of the album surprisingly well. <br /> <br />However, the singles aren't from the disc's only highlights, as, with BEDTIME STORIES, Madonna never takes a wrong step.  The slight-endearing light-dance cuts \\"Don't Stop\\" and Survival\\" and the soulful ballads \\"Forbidden Love\\" and \\"Love Tried To Welcome Me\\" are nearly as strong as the singles, and they settle in well with one another. The album is acceptable in length (around 50 minutes) and it features a set of pretty consistent songs.  As with LIKE A PRAYER, BEDTIME STORIES is a showcase for Madonna's songwrtiting, which perhaps her greatest strength.  Madonna is possibly the most underrated lyricist of her generation, and this album offers an abundance of evidence for this claim.  Of special note is the unusual ballads \\"Inside Of Me\\" and \\"Sanctuary,\\" which are absolutely brilliant compositions, and are two of the most poetic pop songs ever composed.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|How much thought was put into this movie? Really? Was showing the streets of Japan all this movie wanted to do? The movie is simple: two Americans with typical problems about being depressed, pointlessly wandering around Japan while nothing worth caring about happens. It's as if the story was made up as it went along. There was no real script it seems. To say the whole film was nothing but an expensive home video of tourists wouldn't be far off. Literally, this is nothing but people on vacation, who happen to be sad, doing stuff together, and then presto, we have a real winner because Scarlett Johanssen's panties are shot tastefully by a bigshot director's daughter. What a real \\"thought-provoking\\" \\"indie-art\\" flick huh?
B000002MFN|4.0|EROTICA contains so much of Madonna's very best work, it's a shame that there has always been such a negative stigma attached to it.  The album came out simultaneously with Madonna's controversial SEX book and the unintentionally hilarious box office bomb BODY OF EVIDENCE.  Though the album peaked at #2 on the Hot 200 and was certified Double-Platinum, a huge backlash ensued shortly after it's release which tarnished the disc's image in the minds of many.  However, EROTICA represents a very intriguing time in Madonna's career, and it seems like it's time for a reevaluation of it's worth.  Madonna was entering into a risky, non-commercial territory with this release, and the result of her venture is a deeply personal, occasionally frustrating, and always fascinating recording.  There are also some genuinely breathtaking moments here, and that's what makes it essential for anyone with even a passing interest in the singer.   <br /> <br />The smash title track (#3 Pop, #1 Dance) is similar to 1991's \\"Justify My Love,\\" but with a much better melody and an absolutely killer hook.  The eerily distorted sounds, the bizarre instrumental loops, and Madonna's contrasting vocals (a gravely sing-speak style on the verses, which leads into a shrilly soprano for the chorus) are all factors that create the most overtly sensual, yet slightly disturbing single in Madonna's catalogue.  Even if you don't particularly like this song, I'm certain you won't soon forget it.  Madonna also successfully flirts with some new genres of music, including bass-heavy hip hop on \\"Waiting\\" and \\"Did You Do It,\\" reggae with the terrific \\"Why's It So Hard,\\" and even some light jazz with the misunderstood \\"Where Life Begins\\" and the beautifully understated \\"Secret Garden.\\"  Surprisingly, Madonna handles all of the above styles expertly, without ever sounding awkward or forced.  <br /> <br />Madonna is back on familiar ground with the unabashed disco of \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" (#7 Pop, #1 Dance), which is perhaps her best pure dance cut of the nineties, and it remains one of the ultimate club anthems.  The seemingly confessional \\"Bad Girl\\" (#36 Pop, #1 Dance) was the third single, and while it became her first single to fail to crack the Top 20, it remains perhaps Madonna's most criminally underrated songs.  A fatalistic semi-ballad that details the unhealthy addictions and empty affairs of it's titular character, \\"Bad Girl\\" ranks along with \\"Live To Tell\\" and \\"Like A Prayer\\" as one of Madonna's most mature and sophisticated compositions.  The simple, but effective \\"Words\\" overcomes any lyrical clichs with it's delightfully off-kilter arrangement, while the elegant \\"Rain\\" (#14 Pop, #7 Adult Contemporary) is a lovely ballad that would make the late Karen Carpenter proud.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the remaining tracks on EROTICA, while listenable, are not nearly as successful.  \\"Thief Of Hearts\\" is an uninspired rip-off of Blondie's much more vicious classic \\"Rip Her To Shreds,\\"  the international single \\"Bye Bye Baby\\" is brittle and annoying, and AIDS ballad \\"In This Life\\" is well-intentioned but trite.  Madonna's sensual cover of Peggy Lee's \\"Fever\\" fares better, but the dull album version pales in comparison to the excellent remix of the song that was featured in the international music video.  These mediocre tracks often halt the disc's momentum, therefore preventing it from being the hard-hitting masterpiece it could have.  Perhaps Erotica also suffers from being Madonna's first true album of the CD area - like many early-'90s discs, it's simply too long.  If Madonna hadn't been so concerned about filling up the entire 70-plus minutes of a compact disc, maybe the second tier numbers would have ended up cut from the final track listing.  She then could have released a shorter, more consistent album.  Still, Erotica has much to recommend it, and it definitely one of the most interesting mainstream releases of the early nineties.  <br /> <br />NOTE:  In early 1994, Madonna chalked up another big soundtrack hit with \\"I'll Remember\\" (#2 Pop, #1 Adult Contemporary), from the box office flop With Honors.  The single was also Madonna's first new collaboration with Pat Leonard in five years.  Like Madonna's 1992 soundtrack ballad \\"This Used To Be My Playground,\\" \\"I'll Remember\\" is a top-notch ballad that is sentimental in only the best way.
B000006TRV|5.0|The sound track \\"The Wall\\" is most probably the best rock album in history!  This CD combines rock, theatre, and an alter state of conscienceness!  I highly reccomend this musical journey through Roger Waters mind.
B00004X01U|2.0|The title song (#1 Pop, #1 Dance) became her 12th #1 hit on the Hot 100, and is the third-biggest single (behind \\"Take A Bow\\" and \\"Like A Virgin\\") of Madonna's entire career.  The track is a swirling, synth-heavy mix of hard beats, blubbering vocals, and a killer hook.  In other words, it's a terrific single, and easily the best dance recording of 2000.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for it's album counterpart, full of loud synthesized noises, but little of the strong songwriting that made RAY OF LIGHT a tremendous success.   <br /> <br />Madonna and  Mirwais Ahmadzai produced and wrote the majority of the tracks, and it's clear that they don't have enough ideas to fill up an entire album.  The two try to blend traditional music in untraditional ways on \\"I Deserve It\\" and the hit \\"Don't Tell Me\\" (#4 Pop, #1 Dance), but the two numbers end up sounding awkward and endless.  This mixing folk/country elements with British trip-hop is an undeniably interesting idea, but it just doesn't work, or at least not in the hands of Madonna and Ahmadzai.   <br /> <br />Another reason MUSIC isn't any more successful is because the songwriting is surprisingly weak.  Madonna had transformed herself into a top-notch lyricist on LIKE A PRAYER, BEDTIME STORIES, and RAY OF LIGHT, but here she offers some of the most empty, nonsensical lyrics she's ever come up with.  The prime offender is the tuneless \\"Paradise (Not For Me),\\" where Madonna recites increasingly silly lyrics like \\"There is a light, above my head.\\"  Okay!  Madonna and Ahmadzai also use the vocoder way too much, most obviously on the grating \\"Nobody Perfect,\\" which runs the device into the ground.   <br /> <br />Other than \\"Music,\\" the only Madonna-Ahmadzai track that I like is the over-the-top \\"Impressive Instant,\\" which is so relentlessly giddy that all of the overboard production gimmicks and silly lyrics actually work.  William Orbit also climbs aboard for three tracks, but only the mournful \\"Gone\\" even comes close to the level of quality that he and Madonna achieved with RAY OF LIGHT.  The Madonna-Orbit production \\"Runaway Lover\\" is merely adequate, while the charmless \\"Amazing\\" is nothing but a blatant copy of their own superior hit \\"Beautiful Stranger.\\"  One can't help but wonder why Orbit-produced soundtrack cuts \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" and \\"American Pie\\" weren't included as bonus cuts, which would have made the album indefinitely better.  <br /> <br />However, there is one moment of greatness (again, beside the title track) found on this otherwise disappointing release.  The minor hit \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" (#23 Pop, #27 Adult Contemporary, #1 Dance), the only track produced with Guy Sigsworth and Mark \\"Spike\\" Stent, is well-written song that is produced and performed with great restraint.  After hearing the rest of the album, that is very refreshing indeed.  This album became Madonna's fourth album to hit #1 on the Hot 100 (and her first since 1989's LIKE A PRAYER), but it didn't remain on the charts as long as RAY OF LIGHT did.  It managed to reach Double-Platinum status in sales, but couldn't match LIGHT's Quadruple-Platinum success.
B0007GAEGC|1.0|You look very good! Unfortunately, this album sucks musically. <br /> You will be a great model but it is not enough in the world of music.
B000002LND|5.0|It does not matter that many of this compilation's tracks have been severely edited, with anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes removed.  It does not matter that several others have been unnecessarily remixed.  It does not matter that over a half-dozen chart hits (by name, \\"Angel,\\" \\"Dress You Up,\\" \\"True Blue,\\" \\"Who's That Girl,\\" \\"Causing A Commotion,\\" \\"Oh Father,\\" \\"Keep It Together,\\" and \\"Hanky Panky\\") have been completely omitted.  And it does not matter that the entire package has been mastered in the pointless (and now extinct) Q-sound process, which makes everything sound slightly more high-pitched than intended.   <br /> <br />No, none of these miscalculations matter a single bit, because listening to so many of Madonna's best singles in chronological order is nothing less than amazing.  There is a reason that Madonna was the best singles artist of the eighties, and THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION showcases all her strengths and virtually none of her weaknesses.  True, I would have preferred for all of the songs to be presented in their original single/album versions, however all of the edits are very well done - you don't really feel like your missing anything.  And some of the remixes help give the material a fresh spin.   <br /> <br />The very slightly remixed versions of \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" and \\"Open Your Heart\\" are actually superior to the True Blue album versions, and the heavily-remixed take on \\"Like A Prayer\\" transforms the song into a stunning epic.  The house remix of \\"Express Yourself\\" is less successful, and opening bongo drum/finger snap intro of \\"Vogue\\" has been needlessly extended (and therefore nearly killing the song's momentum), and some of the song's killer synth lines have been removed.  However, the new mixes of \\"Express Yourself\\" and \\"Vogue\\" do still manage to keep the songs' respective powers.  And while the omitted songs were undeniably big hits (\\"Who's That Girl\\" even hit #1), the haunting \\"Oh Father\\" and the soulful \\"Keep It Together\\" are the only ones that really rank with Madonna's best.   <br /> <br />Two newly recorded songs close the collection, and they both became Top Ten hits in their own right.  I've never been a very big fan of the controversial smash \\"Justify My Love\\" (#1 Pop, #1 Dance), which I find more silly than sexy.  However, the Platinum-selling single is a fan favorite, and I respect Madonna's willingness to cover new territory.  \\"Rescue Me\\" (#9 Pop, #6 Dance) is more unoriginal (it sounds very similar to Dee-lite's \\"Power Of Love\\"), but Madonna's passionate vocal carries the song over any such obstacles.   <br /> <br />The two new hits helped THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION hit #2 on the Hot 200 and spend over a year on the chart.  It has been certified Platinum 10 times over, and ties LIKE A VIRGIN as Madonna's best-selling album in the US to date.  Despite any edits or missing tracks, THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION is one of the best singles compilations of the modern pop era, and a must for both Madonna's fanatical and casual fans.
B00000DCHE|4.0|By the time 1981 rolled around, Billy Joel had established himself as a legitimate superstar.  Billy would have seven studio albums under his belt but had yet to make a live album.    Billy Joel's 1981 release \\"Songs in the Attic\\" would be a live album with a different spin.    The main purpose of this album was: 1) To provide a live collection of Billy Joel songs; 2) To focus around \\"Old Billy Joel\\" songs from early in his career - songs that had almost been forgotten about - or not heard much by the average fan.   As a result, Billy provides a \\"live\\" album with a different spin when you compare it to many other live releases.    Overall Billy succeeds in providing this spin while providing a very good album. <br /> <br />I look at Billy Joel's career as having three phases. The first phase is what I call \\"Old Billy Joel\\". This basically includes all of his material from \\"Cold Spring Harbor\\" through \\"Turnstiles\\". These are perhaps the strongest days as the piano sound, but they also contain most of Joel's least heard material. The next phase is what I call \\"Middle Billy Joel\\". This was his most successful period and covers from \\"The Stranger\\" to \\"Billy Joel Greatest Hits Volume 1 and 2\\". Joel would go through a transition during this phase - expanding his musical horizons and exploring different avenues. The final phase is the \\"Later Billy Joel\\" phase - this covers \\"The Bridge\\" to \\"River of Dreams\\". In this phase, Billy would start to incorporate some of his older styles of music while not abandoning his desire to continue to explore new avenues.  While \\"Songs in the Attic\\" was released in the \\"Middle Billy Joel\\" (Phase 2) period, all of the music comes from \\"Old Billy Joel\\" (Phase 1). <br /> <br />\\"Songs in the Attic\\" provides 11 tracks from the \\"Old Billy Joel\\" phase.   The songs are distributed from the four albums from this period:  \\"Cold Spring Harbor\\" (\\"She's Got a Way\\", \\"Everybody Loves You Now\\"); \\"Piano Man\\" (\\"You're My Home\\", \\"The Battle of Billy the Kid\\",\\"Captain Jack\\"); \\"Streetlife Serenade\\" (\\"Streetlife Serenader\\", \\"Los Angelenos\\"); \\"Turnstiles\\" (\\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\", \\"Summer, Highland Falls\\", \\"I've Loved These Days\\", \\"Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)\\".    While this collection does contain some well-known songs such as \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\" and \\"Captain Jack\\", I give credit for Billy Joel for going out on a limb an stay away from the more commercially known hits.   In the liner notes, Billy does explain that he looked to include songs that had a lot of passion when played live.  Many of the old songs translated into some very passionate performances.   He explains that \\"Piano Man\\" wasn't included because it sounds similar live as it does on the studio version.  Once again, Billy succeeds at including a collection of songs that display passion.   Ath the same time, I would have liked to have seen more than two songs from both \\"Cold Spring Harbor\\" and \\"Streetlife Serenade\\". <br /> <br />When I review a live album, I usually prefer the album to basically be a full recording of a concert.   In other words, I prefer the tracks come a single night's performance and be arranged in the order that they were played in concert. I normally am not one for edited concerts or live compilations.   However, as far \\"Songs in the Attic\\" goes, I feel I have to bend my rule.   Billy Joel's intent wasn't to release a live album, but to bring visibility to the passion and the energy generated from those older songs.   While I still would have liked to seen all of these songs from a single performance, this might have been a very difficult thing to accomplish. <br /> <br />There are no poor performances on this collection, however there are going to be some tracks that stand out above some of the others.  I was very surprised that it was \\"She's Got a Way\\" was the single that garnered the most attention.   While it's a nice song, I would definitely categorize it as one of the album's weaker tracks.   Perhaps one of the best songs is \\"Los Angelenos\\".   This is often a forgotten song when looking at the Billy Joel music portfolio.   While we think of Billy as a \\"New York Kind of Guy\\", Billy did spend some of the early years of his career in California.   Billy delivers an outstanding passion and energy of this song - complete with good use of Synthesizers.    When it comes to forgotten tunes, many forget about some of the outstanding tracks on Billy's debut \\"Cold Spring Harbor\\".   One standout song on \\"Cold Spring Harbor\\" is \\"Everybody Loves You Now\\".   When you listen to the live version included on \\"Songs in the Attic\\", you will hear an even better version of this track.      Finally, the live version of \\"Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)\\" is another Billy tune that gets forgotten about.   This version will eclipse the version that was found on \\"Turnstiles\\" - and once again succeeds in delivering the passion that was a goal Billy had set forward when making this collection. <br /> <br />The enhanced version of this collection includes video versions of three of the songs on this collection: \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\", \\"Los Angelenos\\", and \\"You're My Home\\".  These videos aren't going to be the best in terms of quality, but they may still satisfy the Billy Joel fan.   The liner notes for \\"Songs in the Attic\\" are outstanding - especially for a live collection.    There are two write-ups - one by producer Phil Ramone and one by Billy himself.  Also included in the liner notes are lyrics - something very unusual for a live and/or compilation album.  Overall, this is a very good live collection.   Not only will this satisfy the serious Billy Joel fan, but someone who has a casual interest will want to check this out as well.   Highly recommended.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Most of Madonna's very best work is right here.  Madonna and Pat Leonard reached the peak of their songwriting partnership with this album, and their work here results in some of Madonna's most stunning material.  The gospel-influenced title track (#1 Pop, #3 Adult Contemporary, #1 Dance) puts Madonna on a new level as an artist.  She has never been more successful at balancing symbolic social/moral issues with danceable pop as she is here. In fact, the entire album finds Madonna perfecting and expanding upon her trademark sound.  There's lots of variety here - the delightful smash \\"Cherish\\" (#2 Pop, #1 Adult Contemporary) is one the most perfect pop ditties ever, the bubbly \\"Dear Jessie\\" paints a surreal and imaginative portrait of the innocent and universal love of children, and the skittering, spousal abuse-themed \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\" is almost uncomfortably chilling - and Madonna handles it all with vigor and aplomb.   <br /> <br />Perhaps the most affective and surprising moments on LIKE A PRAYER come from the unflinchingly autobiographical elements that form the core of several songs.  This is also the album in which Madonna first really showcased her talent as a top-notch lyricist.  Particularly effective is \\"Promise To Try,\\" in which Madonna sings about the effect that losing her mother had on her.  This could have easily sounded trite, but Madonna gives the song a unique twist by writing the lyrics to the child she once was, and from a third person perspective.  The lovely, passionately-performed \\"Spanish Eyes\\" also avoids clich with a delicate simplicity that is as beautiful as it is haunting.  However, the most beautifully shattering track on LIKE A PRAYER is hands down the breathtaking \\"Oh Father\\" (#20 Pop).  The vocals, lyrics, and orchestration all flawlessly come together in one cathartic masterpiece, that rivals only \\"Live To Tell\\" as the absolute best Madonna-Leonard collaboration. <br /> <br />LIKE A PRAYER also finds Madonna writing with SteveBray again, with the wailing soul of \\"Express Yourself\\" (#2 Pop, #12 Adult Contemporary, #1 Dance) and the hard funk of \\"Keep It Together\\" (#8 Pop, #1 Dance) remaining two of their best collaborations.  Prince dropped by to co-write and duet on the spooky \\"Love Song,\\" which, due to it's slightly off-kilter melody, isn't as immediately assessable as the rest of the disc, but becomes oddly hypnotic after several listens.  Madonna finally received the long-sought praise of music critics with this release, and the public also responded to her efforts - LIKE A PRAYER hit #1 on the Hot 200 and has been certified Quintuple-Platinum.  Easily one of the corner stones of Madonna's career, and possibly her best-loved work.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I've been a Batman fan since I was 10 years old. I loved him because he was an ordinary human...no super powers. Plus he was dark and had the worst criminals shaking in their boots. Adam West certainl didn't fit the bill. And while Michael Keaton in the 1989 movie was significantly better, the movie was really about Nicholson's Joker. <br /> <br />CHristian Bale portrayed the Batman exactly as intended, a frightening, obsessed vigilante who used his brain, martial arts, and tools to find and apprehend criminal scum. I only wish Bob Kane, the creator of Batman, had lived to see this film. He would have loved it too.
B000005ALN|3.0|It took six years for George Michael to release his follow-up to 1990's brilliant-yet-misunderstood LISTEN WITHOUT PREJUDICE and to say that this album was highly anticipated by Michael's loyal fan base is a grave understatement.  When OLDER (Michael's one and only release on the Dreamworks label in the US) did finally hit stores, it was met with an extremely mixed reaction among fans and critics.  The album was successful, hitting #6 in the US and #1 in the UK, and selling a few million copies worldwide, but it still divides listeners almost evenly to this day.  There are many who consider the album to be a mature, adult pop recording, while an almost equal number tend to view the disc as a pompous, bloated ego-trip from an undeniably talented  musician who takes himself way too seriously.  When listening to the album objectionably, it seems that both groups are right - Older is both an complex album of musical mastery AND a somewhat misguided attempt by a gifted pop star trying too hard to make a \\"serious\\" recording. <br /> <br />George Michael is an artist who has never received his proper due from music critics or the general public, and I can understand why he would make such a obvious stab for artistic respect.  As a result, OLDER is an almost joyless recording, with two brilliant dance cuts \\"Fast Love\\" (#7 US, #1 UK) and \\"Star People\\" (#2 UK) thrown in to round things out.  That would not be a problem if the record was as musically engaging from beginning to end as it is on a handful of tracks.  The jazzy ballads \\"Jesus to a Child\\" (#6 US, #1 UK), \\"You Have Been Loved\\" (#2 UK), and the title track (#2 UK) are three of Michael's loveliest compositions, and if the rest of the album was as strong as the these tracks, then maybe the album really would have finally earned Michael the respect he deserves.  Unfortunately, none of the remaining songs have melodies that truly stand out, which leaves the record sounding somewhat samey and occasionally dull.  It alwayssounds good and professional, but isn't always memorable.  As it is, OLDER is a good record, but not a masterpiece.
B000002J0G|5.0|I completely agree with other reviews ... Louie was a single bass <br />and unoriginal drummer , John is a awesome drummer and makes the album alot more interesting. And I can't say enough about James Murphy! Working with Chuck Schuldiner of Death would be a tough job as Chuck was a great writer and player RIP . And to hear James Murphy cover a Al Dimeola song for any of you guitar players who know who that is says alot... But Alex Skolnick is a outstanding guitar player. Just search for Attention Deficit or Alex Skolnick Trio on Amazon and you will see how good Alex is.. He is into Jazz now and who can't blame him... More complex musically and it's very limitless music.. I saw Alex at a guitar seminar in Atlanta and he has changed the way I look at and play music. Thanks to him I no long swim in a small shallow pond of music. I appreciate all styles. Like he said 12 years ago in that seminar you can only play so many solo's chugging in E or D or drop C.. Very limiting... <br />This is a great album by Testament but never count out the man who help bring them to the forefront so you even know who they are.. <br />ROCK ON !!!
B00005J6T0|3.0|Madonna's biggest album in worldwide sales, TRUE BLUE was a huge smash in the US as well.  The album spent five weeks at #1 on the Hot 200 and has sold 20 million copies worldwide, with a hefty seven million copies (that's Platinum 7 times over) sold in the US alone.  Madonna took a very active role in producing the record, and had a hand in writing all nine songs.  Her singing voice was also noticeably stronger this time around, with more control and emotion.  This was also the first full-length recording where the pitch of Madonna's vocals were not mechanically altered, leaving the album with sexier, more adult-sounding aura than her previous albums.     <br /> <br />Madonna's vocals have rarely sounded as confident and impassioned as on the semi-controversial hit \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" (#1 Pop, #16 Adult Contemporary, #4 Dance), during which her intense delivery convinces us that this song really matters.  She gives a similarly effective vocal on the smash fourth single \\"Open Your Heart\\" (#1 Pop, #1 Dance), which is a terrific dance track, despite some unimaginative lyrics (\\"I hold the lock, you hold the key\\").  Madonna's incredibly determined performance (and the song's blistering rock-infused sound) makes \\"Open Your Heart\\" a standout.  It does not matter that her strained voice sometimes sounds raspy and off-key, because when she sings, \\"don't try to run, I can keep up with you,\\" the listener can really feel her determination.  The conviction in her performances are more evident in these two songs than in anywhere else in her entire career, and it single-handedly makes both songs classics.  These are also the only two songs on the album that Madonna co-wrote with outside songwriters, she collaborated with mainstays Patrick Leonard and Steve Bray on the remaining seven tracks.   <br /> <br />One of those Ciccone-Leonard compositions remains one of Madonna's best-written song:  the pensive smash \\"Live To Tell\\" (#1 Pop, #1 Adult Contemporary).  Originally featured inthe film AT CLOSE RANGE, \\"Live To Tell\\" is a complex ballad which Madonna lends even more maturity and intensity to with her still-yearning-after-all-these-years performance.  There were some critics (including ROLLING STONE magazine) who argued that \\"Live To Tell\\" was a rewrite of Joni Mitchell's simple folk ballad \\"Both Sides Now,\\" but I honestly don't hear it that way at all.  As a matter of fact, it remains Madonna's finest moment as a songwriter, in my opinion.  Her seemingly newfound maturity is also present in the vivid \\"La Isla Bonita\\" (#4 Pop, #1 Adult Contemporary) and scorching \\"White Heat\\", both also written with Leonard.   <br /> <br />Leonard and Bray are obviously key figures in Madonna's mid-eighties success, and together the three of them manage to even make some otherwise flimsy songs work much better than they should.  For example, Madonna, Leonard, and Steve Bray pool their considerable talents on the obvious-but-fun \\"Where's The Party,\\" while the irresistible Ciccone-Bray title track (#3 Pop, #6 Dance) is paper-thin, but completely adorable.  Unfortunately, the remaining two songs are shockingly weak - TRUE BLUE definitely isn't as consistent as MADONNA or LIKE A VIRGIN.  Madonna and Leonard really fumble with the embarrassingly saccharine \\"Love Makes The World Go Round,\\" which is so sugary that it may give listeners cavities upon listening.  Madonna and Steve Bray also really hit rock-bottom with the grating \\"Jimmy Jimmy,\\" which is quite possibly the most annoying number that Madonna ever committed to vinyl.   <br /> <br />The album would probably play much better if the weaker numbers weren't sequenced right at the end, however, even then, TRUE BLUE'S parts are still greater than the sum.  Even though it has some of Madonna's best work, the album really never plays as a satisfying whole.  Where Nile Rodgers' inventive production unified much of LIKE A VIRGIN and carried the listener through that album's few weak moments, TRUE BLUE'S multipleproducers (including Madonna, Leonard, and Bray) give the album a patchwork feel that makes the filler really stand out.  Even the terrific singles don't really seem to belong on the same disc.  However, TRUE BLUE contains so many big hits (it's nine tracks include five Top Five hits) that it's flaws won't bother most listeners.  Plus the end result is still quite good, and it gives you a taste of the maturity that was to come three years later with LIKE A PRAYER.

B00008S2VG|3.0|Madonna's AMERICAN LIFE album was released with great fanfare and promotion and became her fifth album to hit #1 on the Hot 200, and her second consecutive album to debut in the top spot.  Unfortunately, most critics mascaraed the album as broodingly terrible effort from aging, self-absorbed pop star that had completely lost touch with reality.  The album was even hated by many hardcore Madonna fans, and (after it's sole week in Billboard's top position) the disc quickly slid off the charts before even being certified as Gold in sales.  While it did eventually earn a Gold and Platinum certifications, AMERICAN LIFE is the first album of Madonna's entire career not to reach said Platinum-status during it's initial chart run.    Interestingly, for an album that had faced such harsh ridicule and contempt, I actually find AMERICAN LIFE to be a solidly good effort from Madonna, containing some of her very best material, and marred only by a couple of complete missteps.  In fact, I feel that AMERICAN LIFE is quite superior to 2000's MUSIC album.  MUSIC was highly praised by most fans and critics, but I found it to be an inconsistent and awkward affair, salvaged only by the title track and \\"What it feels like for a Girl.\\"  AMERICAN LIFE is simply a much stronger album, and is completely undeserving of the ire it often receives from the masses.  Working primarily again with Mirwais Ahmadzai, AMERICAN LIFE is very much an extension of the techno/folk blend that began on Music with such songs as \\"I Deserve It\\" and \\"Don't Tell Me.\\"  I found this combination to be unnerving and gaudy on MUSIC, but Madonna and Ahmadzai are far more successful in combining these elements on AMERICAN LIFE.  This is primarily because on this disc (and unlike on the MUSIC album) the duo has actually written a solid set of songs for this album rather than simply rely on the various production gimmicks as they did on their previous outing.  Madonna's much-criticized political and spiritual ramblings often do come off as ham-fisted and naïve, but she is conversely very successful in the bittersweet personal refection that marks the very best of her \\"serious\\" work.    Although they each contain various techno flourishes, songs like \\"Love Profusion,\\" \\"Nothing Fails,\\" \\"Intervention,\\" \\"X-Static Process,\\" and \\"Easy Ride\\" are confessional, reflective numbers that feature some of Madonna's most melodic vocals and are backed with relatively sparse production that gives each of them a sort of hushed intensity.  It is a testament to the songwriting of Madonna and company that any of these songs would have been just as effective in a completely acoustic setting.  Sadly, the otherwise cleverly-written \\"I'm So Stupid\\" falls victim to too many production gimmicks, with too much vocal-processing on the chorus (after a reasonably subdued verse) making Madonna's voice sound way too shrill and unpleasant.  This number would have benefitted from striped down further.    While Madonna and Ahmadzai finally succeed at crafting their own brand of techno/folk, the duo also crank out a couple terrific pure dance tunes as well.  Although the Madonna's lyrics for \\"Hollywood\\" are rather simplistic and pedestrian, the songs sails on it's killer hook and a lively discotheque arrangement that eases down like aural cotton candy (and I like the Oakenfold remix even better).  \\"Hollywood\\" is great fun, but \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" leaves me absolutely breathless!  A stunning assault of deep dance beats and airy vocals soaring through an instantly memorable refrain, \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" is an unheralded masterpiece in Madonna's canon of songs and deserves to be referenced along with \\"Vogue\\" and \\"Ray of Light\\" as one of Madonna's very finest dance recordings.  Unfortunately, AMERICAN LIFE also features three of Madonna's biggest blunders.  Frankly, the album versions of the title track and \\"Mother and Father\\" are the most mind-numbingly terrible sins that Madonna has ever unleashed upon the unsuspecting public.  In it's original album incarnation, \\"Mother and Father\\" appears to be completely devoid of any melody, and Madonna's sounds unnaturally high-pitched to the point of being completely unlistenable.  Ironically, I greatly enjoy the Peter Rauhofer remix of \\"Mother and Father,\\" which drops the ill-suited, chilly European sythns of the Madonna/Ahmadzai-produced original and adds dark down beats that manage to ground Madonna's helium-voiced delivery and make a satisfying contrast.  From listening to the effective remix next to the abysmal remix, it is clear that Rauhofer had much better instincts on how to handle the material than either Madonna or Ahmadzai.  I feel very much the same way about the painful title track, which is possibly Madonna's worst recording since 1986's \\"Jimmy Jimmy\\" (which was possibly the most irritating recording ever recorded by ANYONE).  The album mix of the title track finds Madonna delivering the most inane political/spiritual/materialistic rant of her career against the backdrop of what sounds like Ahmadzai operating a dentist's drill - and Madonna actually attempts a full-fledged rap, of which she succeeds about as well as my 80-year old grandmother would at attempting the same feat!  Shock above all shocks, I actually like the Rauhofer remix of this horrendous track, which would more accurately be described as a complete overhaul of the song rather than a simple remix.  Rauhofer adds an appropriately heavy, but still reasonably paced backing that gives the song a completely different, vastly improved feel, and fortunately removes all of Madonna's unfortunate attempt at rap.  The album also picks up 2002's soundtrack hit \\"Die Another Day,\\" which is not only one of Madonna's weakest recordings, but also the worst Bond theme ever.  I was a bit surprised to see this track make an appearance here, as Madonna has been notorious about excluding various soundtrack hits on surrounding albums in the past.  Perhaps Madonna and Ahmadzai were a bit short on material for this album, or maybe Warner Bros. pressured the duo to include a proven hit on the disc?  Anyhow, AMERICAN LIFE would have benefitted by dropping the threadbare \\"Day\\" altogether.  Overall, Madonna's AMERICAN LIFE is good album with some of Madonna's absolute best material, and quite undeserving of the thrashing it still commonly receives from both critics and fans.  Although the album is marred by two of Madonna's worst-ever recordings, even those two monstrosities were improved greatly by subsequent remixes.  I really wish Madonna utilized someone like Rauhofer as her producer for this project instead of Ahmadzai, and maybe even performed a few of the best songs (like \\"Intervention\\" or \\"X-Static Process\\") completely acoustic.  As is, the album is still much better than it's unfortunately tarnished reputation.
6304119046|5.0|Well, golly, I heard this was just the BEST FILM EVER, so I checked it out for myself to see what the big fuss is all about (and maybe to take it down a peg or two with my vast, encyclopediac knowledge of cinema and aesthetics) and omygod I was just so bored, bored almost to death.  I'm telling you I had tears of boredom streaming down my checks!!  There were no aliens or big explosions and no big stars like Bruce Willis or Jackie Chan.  It was even in black and white for cripes sake!!  It was all just so boring, particularly all that human drama crap and stuff about political machinery and newspapers shaping public opinion (I never trust the critics myself!!) and sex scandals and betrayals of trust.  Everyone knows the purpose of all film from all eras is to entertain ME, with all that stuffing between my ears, so what the hell was Wells thinking?  I mean does he really expect us to care about the corruption of innocence or to reflect on the American dream??  Does he really think we care one jot about subtle nuances of lighting and expressive camera angles or a complex, fragmented narrative structure that enacts the unknowable nature of certain human truths??  Or that old \\"classical\\" type score by Bernard Herrmann??  Why, he should have used some good rap music to liven things up.  It's obvious a grand conspiracy is being perpetuated against all us \\"normal folks\\" who love Forrest Gump and Dukes of Hazard by those high-falutin' elitist critics who think Mr. Wellz' film is so great.  Yeah, right, like I would read what they have to say, that would be boring too.  Boy they aren't gonna pull the wool over my eyes.  I mean I wasn't born yesterday, and I've seen all the great classics like Gone with the Wind and Bambi and so forth.  Have I mentioned that this film is SO BORING???  The greatest films of all time are the ones that keep ME on the edge of MY seat without making ME think very much about MY movie experience which is so valid that I just had to tell all you people who love and study this film that it really sucks because I thought about these comments for a whole five minutes.  Maybe, though, I'm just a troll.  In any event, my criteria for excellence should be evident.  I don't like films that are boring to a person who is easily bored.  Don't waste your precious time on this old warhorse, go rent Independence Day and Dieharder and Aliens II.  Stay away from this film, which is obviously overrated by all those pinhead critics as you can see because I say so.  Did I mention that my IQ is 137?  You should just see all the things I accomplished by age 25.  Wulles had no clue what was entertaining to me.  His film is so dang BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|This review is in response to the earlier one written by Rat Scabies Jr.    I am not a kid. I am old enough to have heard The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and The Clash, when their songs were the current hits on the radio, not stuff of the oldies stations. I saw Black Sabbath live back in the 1970s. I have heard plenty of music, both good and bad over the decades, and so I provide my comments with a great deal of listening experience.    I don't care if it qualifies as Metal, Progressive, or any other label that some snobby reviewer tries to pigeon-hole it into, Tool's Lateralus is one of the greatest rock albums ever made, easily on my all-time top ten list. (Just skip over the waste of disc space called \\"Faaip De Oiad\\").
B00005JLEU|5.0|Chihiro is this girl moving away with her parents to a new home. On their way there they sort of take a short cut into a tunnel to another side. No people no sound no nothing, just  an abandoned area. Chihiro starts wining telling her parents that she wants to leave, but they stay a little while longer and they find a place with lots of food is displayed and start chowing down nonstop. Chihiro looks around and explores the place by the time she got back her parents had turned into pigs. What a shock! Turned into pigs, she's all alone, scared and doesn't know what to do and.. a boy appears. Who is this character? She tries to leave the place but it was too late the way they came from was filled with water, spirits began to appear everywhere.. She got \\"\\"Spirited Away\\"\\" into a world she does not know.. and her adventures begin. <br />I tell you each scene makes you want to know what will chihiro do next,  what kind of spirits will roam in to the place. It was a strange place to be in, Spirits taking spas... a flying dragon being chased by small flying papers.. a giant baby that is trapped in a room... Ghosts taking the train... and lots more. a Surely Imaginative place you want to explore and see for yourself.  One of the nice things I noticed about this movie is that chihiro learned life lessons exploring this spirited world. <br /> <br />DVD features: <br /> favorite parts in the dvd features <br />- were how he managed to draw the dragon visiting a pet store. <br />- Finding out what his inspirations were to create his characters <br />- Taking a sneek peek look at the people behing the camera, the incredible artists,  the actors and actressess from both U.S. and Japan whom did the voices.  <br />- I liked the part where Hayao Miyazaki cooked noodles for all his staff while they were working. Very  nice <br />

B000069KGM|5.0|I don't know why, but critics seem to hail Chicago's second album as being their crowning achievement just about anywhere you read. Not taking anything away from that fine record, but yours truly thinks this album, the original Chicago Transit Authority, is the magnum opus of their collection. Maybe I'm really showing my age here, but I'm not all that wild about the sappy love ballads that are so prominently featured in their later work. I will tell you this though. When I was 21, I fully discovered the magic of the \\"CTA\\", and Jazz Rock as a whole. This record, in my opinion, rides the line between Adult Contemporary, Pop Rock, and Jazz Rock so seamlessly, that it's hardly evident that this music would be for your parents. I would venture to say that \\"CTA\\" will be the record that bridges generational gaps above and beyond any Chicago record. And since I am part of that new generation, I think I have a little of my own authority to lend my opinion. Heart wrenching ballads simply won't live as long as this artistic feat. And as a young listener of classic rock, I'm out to discover who the band \\"really\\" was. Which is why greatest hits records, and an abundance of #1 hit singles don't impress me like they used to.<br /><br />I can't think of a better way to introduce yourself to the world than \\"CTA\\" has. It's a sprawling affair with an unprecedented amount of variety. Soft rock, to hard rock, to jazz rock, to crazy tripped out guitar work; these guys do it brilliantly. They grab you by the nuts with their larger than life \\"Introduction\\". Then comes their hit off the record; the beautiful \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\" with a 2 minute piano solo at the beginning (something the radio single never included). Then comes another big one; the 8 minute epic \\"Beginnings\\" (I love the haunting percussion rant at the end). Another one of my favorites, \\"Questions 67 and 68\\" is also one of the choice cuts. But my all out favorite track on the album has to go to \\"Poem 58\\". That track is immaculately perfect. It boasts some of the greatest lead guitar work that I've ever heard. \\"Free Form Guitar\\" is a whole track dedicated to that crazy tripped out guitar work I was referring to. Other highlights include The Spencer Davis Group cover \\"I'm a Man\\", and the closer \\"Liberation\\".<br /><br />Overall, I'm not to surprised that pop junkies around the world don't revere this album as their best. It's nice to see them at a time where their artistic roots took the front seat. A time when they weren't a romantic ballad hit machine. This is truly Chicago's quintessential masterpiece.58\\".

B00005JM0B|5.0|Great movies, great effects..............it also leave the oportunity open for a next terminator movie.....
B00005QFE5|5.0|Enough about the plot has been said.  I just wanted to recommend this movie.  It is so moving and emotional.  I never tire of watching it.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This album isn't a true \\"best of\\" as Pink Floyd has too many good songs to fit onto only 2 CDs. What this is is a well thought out CONCEPT album. The concept is to have all of the songs segue into each other and create a continuous musical statement. This is why some songs, which are not big hits, are included at the expense of others - choices had to be made for the overall sound and FEEL of the collection. The sequencing is not chronological so the tunes could be arrange to merge as seamlessly as possible and to show them off in there best light. Some songs have been edited to keep things interesting. The song Echoes is only 16 minutes here, down from 23 on the Meddle album. Shine On You Crazy Diamond doesn't include Parts 8 & 9 (the end of Part 7 fits nicely with the opening alarm clocks of Time which is the next song on the disc). I'll listen to the original albums to hear the regular versions and original sequencing; I don't need it here.    Song selection is from the Syd Barrett era (5 Syd vocals)and the classic 70's albums and beyond.  The early albums More, Ummagumma, Atom Heart Mother, Obscured by Clouds do not have any tracks on this collection.     One thing that I am really glad about is that the producers haven't used too many songs from any one album. They could have easily included the songs Welcome To The Machine and Have A Cigar but, that would have been the entire Wish You Were Here album (and what's the point of that?). I wouldn't even mind if the song Wish You Were Here hadn't been included, thereby making Shine On You Crazy Diamond the only song off of that album, and replace it with, say, Childhoods End from Obscured By Clouds. This compilation would still be great and I could listen to Wish You Were Here anytime I wanted to hear the 'missing' songs.    It would have been cool if the producers included the rare version of Pigs On The Wing that features Snowy White playing the middle solo linking Parts 1 & 2 of the song (this is the only Floyd studio recording that White appears on).    Echoes is produced by Pink Floyd and James Guthrie. The over all mastering is probably the best of all the recent floyd re-masters (kudos to Gutherie and Steve Sax, for the great work they've been done with their catalogue the past few years). This compilation shows how much work they put into producing this project. I give this 5 stars for what it is and don't subtract stars for what is missing or has been edited because the overall CONCEPT of the project works for me.    If you are new to Pink Floyd this is a good place to start. After this (or before) you can pick up the staples of their catalogue: Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Wall.    I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the live version of The Wall entitled IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE? The Wall Live 1980-81.  I have never liked the studio version of The Wall and never bought it on CD after I upgraded my album collection.  This live version, however, is brilliant (just re-released in 2005 with a new remaster by James Gutherie).  This represents one of those rare times when a group of hand picked, well rehearsed, talanted musicians help the core band add that elusive 'something' to the music and give it the passion and power not found on the studio release. This show was so complex (and things had to be timed just right) that the band couldn't improvise much (lest they throw someone off and screw everything up), so the songs are very faithfull to the original recordings - only better.    To digress further... Sometimes I find I don't like a groups best selling, most popular, chart topping album. I seem to prefer their more 'obscure' albums: Supertramp's Crisis, What Crisis? over Crime Of The Century, Santana's Caravanserai over Abraxas, Bowie's Hunky Dory over Ziggy Stardust, Wings Wild Life over....etc, etc.... In Pink Floyd's case Obscured by Clouds is the album I like over all the other 'must haves' - I like the unpolished sound to it. Wish You WereHere is a close second.
B00007AJGH|4.0|If you haven't seen it, this is a brilliant merger of live-actors and animated characters. Oh, it's been done before, all the way back to the 1930s or -40s, but never so well. The animated figures don't just talk to the live actors and cast shadows, they open doors, bump into things, and visibly press against the actors they are supposed to be touching. Just a few minutes in, disbelief is thoroughly suspended. The technical achievement sinks into the background (as it should), and the plot moves on.<br /><br />The story's a good one, too. There are lots of ins and outs, a complex land grab, a personal tragedy, and loyalties that surface under pressure. It's kid-safe and -comprehensible, but has enough to keep an adult interested.<br /><br />Not least is the remarkable legal feat of combining dozens of cartoon characters, with copyrights owned by competing studios. Disney, Warner Bros, and Hanna Barbera all contributed. Who ever expected to see Daffy Duck across from Donald? Bugs across from Mickey? Even minor characters appeared, like animated extras from Fantasia, Peter (of wolf fame), and the dragon from Disney's 1941 adaptation of Grahame's book, \\"The Reluctant Dragon\\". Of course, Roger, his wife Jessica (\\"I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way\\"), and lots of other `toons all came to life exclusively for this movie.<br /><br />It's not necessary to have kids in order to have a collection of kids' movies. This one's great for the kid in anybody.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000002MY3|5.0|i may be a man and this album is about a women who is bitting back at men, but my god this is great!!! <br /> <br />there are few things that make me feel like im on another planet, where i shut my eyes, i get shivers down my spine, i feel like ive gone somewhere and i can not explain it! <br /> <br />this is one (live forever, come as u are, scar tissue and coca-cola being the others), this whole album is ni-on perfect! <br /> <br />Musically this is about as good as they come, few more guitar solos would have been nice but as they may not have fitted the songs il let Alanis off!!! <br /> <br />If you wanna be taken on a ride where you feel and experience every emotion possible and just feel better for knowing that it exists, then GET THIS ALBUM!!! <br /> <br />you wont regret it!!
0394800389|5.0|Fox in Socks is a great model for out of the box creative thinking.  When my math and CS students take themselves and their study too seriously, I recommend a rereading of this for fun.  This year, I will have my kids pass the book around the class and each read a page as an icebreaker.  A true classic in every sense of the word.
0393317552|4.0|\\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" is definitely the first book of its kind, so it automatically deserves praise for being original. I really liked the \\"onion\\" approach to answering the question of why some societies are developed and prospering and others are stuck in the hunter-gatherer phase. It also disproves all of the ill constructed rascist theories that attempt to answer the same question. All in all a great read, thought provoking, but a little lengthy, which makes it difficult to get through. If it were only about 150 pages less it would be great.
B00025ETIW|5.0|As much as I adore My Chemical Romance now, there was a point in time in which I couldn't stand them. For some reason or another, every time my brother approached me with his headphones blasting \\"Helena,\\" I just couldn't listen to it. Now in retrospect, I don't know why I reacted that way. Not only do I own both of their albums, but I saw them at the Warped Tour on 8/14 and they were absolutely amazing.  <br /> <br />Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is a concept album, although at first listen you might not realize it. Supposedly, it's about a pair of lovers that are separated by death and the man has to kill 1000 evil men to see his girlfriend again...I'm not even sure if that's it. Some of the tracks don't necessarily fit the mold. I suppose it's a little open to interpretation. If not accustomed to their sound, they might seem a bit, well...scary, for lack of a better word. To truly appreciate this album, in my own opinion, you really do have to listen to it twice, especially if you aren't a fan from the get-go. Each track has its own specific flair, and I'm not sure if I can really pick one bad song.  <br /> <br />\\"Helena\\": The perfect opening song for Three Cheers; great both as part of the concept album aspect and a standalone track. It's just so played out by MtV and the like. A beautiful song, full of simile.   <br /> <br />\\"Give 'Em Hell, Kid\\": I didn't appreciate this one until I saw it live at Warped. The lyrics are really good, but you can't fathom the energy in the music until you hear it in person. <br /> <br />\\"To The End\\": Absolutely fantastic live. I love the rhythm of the song from beginning to end; also a great track for the story behind the songs.  <br /> <br />\\"You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us In Prison\\": Gerard's voice is great in the beginning of this song. I'm not quite sure where this one comes in conceptually, but as a track on its own it's pretty good. <br /> <br />\\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\\": Again, another song played out by the media,but a great one nevertheless. The perfect song for the angry youth of America. :) One of the more fun songs on Three Cheers, if you can classify them as fun.  <br /> <br />\\"The Ghost of You\\": I particularly like this one. Its slower pace and lyrics are at once beautiful and powerful. I love Gerard's voice here; the song adds another part to the story. <br /> <br />\\"The Jetset Life is Gonna Kill You\\": I like bits and pieces of this song, but as a whole it just doesn't do anything for me. My favorite part is when Gerard says \\"Hotel Bella Muerte.\\" :D Other than that...eh. Probably my least favorite.   <br /> <br />\\"Interlude\\"/\\"Thank You For the Venom\\": Each track is great on its own; \\"Interlude\\" is short and beautiful in a haunting, dark and weak fashion, while \\"Venom\\" is pounding and vicious. They're both good, but there's a dissonance there and I don't understand why the former would lead into the latter. Nevertheless, \\"Venom\\" is a great track and sounded good at Warped.  <br /> <br />\\"Hang 'Em High\\": I didn't like this one at first because it's a little too screamy for me and everything just sounds very hurried and fast. But again, upon a second listening I liked it a little more. The music video is cool - check it out if you can find it.  <br /> <br />\\"It's Not a Fashion Statement, It's a Deathwish\\": Musically a bit generic, but lyrically a great track. This one, at least to me, seems like a turning point in the concept album aspect of Three Cheers, like the man is finally realizing what he has to do and is determined to accomplish it.  <br /> <br />\\"Cemetary Drive\\": A bit slower paced than its predecessors, but not exactly like \\"The Ghost of You.\\" This is a great song all-around and is one of my favorites. <br /> <br />\\"I Never Told You What I Do for a Living\\": What a good song. I really love this one; the varying rhythms and Gerard's voice sound great. Conceptually, it closes the book on the story in a way that's fitting - finished yet unfinished (at least for me).  <br /> <br />I must stress that to each their own, and if you aren't a fan of this particular genre you probably won't like it. However, if you plan on giving it a chance, listen through Three Cheers more than once and you'll get the full effect of the music.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0671015206|5.0|I received \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" as a Christmas present several years back. It was a very valuable present, as it studies the behavioural patterns of millionaires in America. Contrary to popular belief, most millionaires do not earn high salaries, have mansions, or drive fancy cars. They are ordinary middle class people who are frugal, watch what they spend, make wise investment choices and live below their means. Buiding wealth is a simple formula: save more than you spend. It's as easy as that. Probably the best book on financial advice I have read.
0789723107|5.0|As an instructor of website design, I have decided to include this book as part of our course. It may touch on topics of design that seem 'common sense' but I have found that time and time again, many students of design fail to 'instinctively' build them into their design without first being reminded in a more formal way.  Krug has a great writing style that covers a variety of design topics in an amusing and informative way.
B00004XPPB|5.0|This is one of the most underrated movies ever made. I think that Goodfellas and The Godfather trilogy (really, only Parts I and II) set the bar so high for mob movies that Donnie Brasco never received the full adulation it deserved. With Al Pacino, he's been brilliant so often that it's a challenge to explain why he's unique in this role. All I can say is that he IS Lefty even had Lefty never existed before. The unkempt hair, the goofy glasses, the mixture of desperation and violence are exactly what we would expect from a long-time, disaffected mafia enforcer. There's no Hollywood glamour; only grit, grime, and charm. That he so captures our sympathy cannot be taken for granted as I'm not sure another actor could influence us the way Pacino does. As for Depp, he won me over a decade ago with Ed Wood, and his portrayal of Brasco is sensational. If you gave a role like this to DiCaprio, it would be a disaster, yet Depp is infinitely competent. Lastly, Madsen as Sonny Black was a real treat. I went online and took a gander at some of the pictures of the real Sonny, and, of course, there are few physical similarites, but he's a stand out as well. I saw Donnie Brasco yesterday for the second time and found that I could not turn it off. If you asked me how long it was, I'd honestly would not know. Not a great movie? Furgettaboutit.

0930289234|5.0|WOw this truly is a masterpiece. It deserves all the praise it's gotten. Alan Moore makes his characters come alive in this book. MOst comic book heroes are really a lot like cardboard, they only have two sides, and it's usually good or bad. But people in life aren;t cardboard, we all have our moments of doubt fear, pain and also regret. This superheroes that mr MOore created in this comic book all have those traits, all of them seem as if they were real people but the fun part of the story is that they're really not.<br /><br /> The storyline might be a bit dated, ( the cold war being over I mean ) but if you read it from the point of view of back then, is still a preety good story. My favorite character was Rorschach, he is describen in detail in this book, and I felt sorry for they way he was treated and looked at troughout, I thought he was the most interesting character in the story. This comic is definetely a must read for anyone who likes good literature. You don't even have to like comics to like this story. This story stands on it's own as a great classic.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon has been discovered by generation after generation since it's release in 1973. Although I myself love the album, it makes me wonder just what makes people feel so strongly about it. I have thought about it many times, and my conclusion is this: the album, which has plenty of input from all the artists in the group, is listenable without a solid break between any of it's beautiful songs. It enables you to experience it as a flowing, continuous, gorgeous piece of art. The album is much deeper than just the songs. If you want proof, then read the VH 1 100 Greatest songs ever list. Not one song from Dark Side of the Moon is on it, yet it's considered possibly the greatest album of all time. It is the arrangement and the order of the songs that counts the most, and how they effect you. The progression of the album is perfect, the order of the songs is brillilant. They hit you in exactly the right way, and put you in the mood that the artists must have been feeling when they wrote these songs. This is an album not to be thrown on to be listened to half-heartedly. It should be given time, focus, and analysis. Believe me, it's worth it.
1401206905|4.0|THis sory is ver well told. I liked the art in this book, very dark , very gothic,very Batman. The story does have some flaws, like the addition of the catwoman, she wasn't needed in this story. I would also had liked it if it would have been a bit longer. BUt other than that this story is preety cool. I also liked the fact that it also told the story from Jim Gordon point of view, there is very few Batman stories which include his point of view. This is the 2nd best Batman story after the Dark Knight Returns. But is is definetely better than the awful the Dark Knight strikes again, and it's story is also better than the Joel Schumacher Batman movies.
B000001ELL|4.0|(My rating scale: 1- Bad, 2- Average, 3- Good, 4- Very Good, 5- Excellent/Classic)    1979's Dynasty was the beginning of the end for the classic KISS lineup.  Peter Criss very much on his last legs with the band.  But, Ace really does turn up in fine form here.  Without Ace, this album is not more than two stars.      So, thus begins the so-called \\"disco\\" era for KISS.  The album kicking off with \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\".  Disco or not, this is a classic KISS tune.  Deal with it folks....    Then Ace takes over.  His cover of the Stones' \\"2000 Man\\" just kicks everything to a higher level.  Almost better than the original!  Ace actually had three songs on this album ( a feat he'd repeat on Unmasked) and they are all strong.  \\"Hard Times\\" and \\"Save Your Love\\" benefit from the Space Ace's laid back vocals and strong guitar vibe.    Paul kind of gets lost on this album.  He had the afformentioned \\"IWMFLY\\" and he also has the nice \\"Sure Know Something\\" which is a song that only got it's due years later on the Unplugged album.  It has one of Gene's best basslines EVER!  And Paul has a very forgettable song, \\"Magic Touch\\".     Gene, for what it's worth, wasn't in his best writing period during these years, but he does offer up the awfully catchy, \\"Charisma\\".  We'll just forget \\"X-Ray Eyes\\", okay then.....    Peter...well....he was in full drug mode by this time.  He was replaced for large portions of the album as a result.  Somehow, he still got a tune on Dynasty.  \\"Dirty Living\\"...well, not the worst song in the KISS catalogue, but clearly, Peter was a non-entity.    Dynasty is the last rocking KISS album from the 1970's era.  They would go slightly astray for a few years, before coming back with Creatures of the Night and Lick it Up.  But Dynasty is enjoyable listening for the most part, and worth a four star rating.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|Ok so the movie made me laugh in a few occasions, but overall I felt this movie was kind of boring. I guess I don't understand this type of comedy, but I went to see it anyway because almost everyone in my school was telling me about how funny this movie was. SO I saw and I almost fell asleep halfway though. This movie is really stupid. The only ocasions when I laughed was when Pedro was talking, I thought he was kind of funny. So definitely this movie is overrated.
B00005JNTX|4.0|Sin City is a good movie.It's one comic flick that sticks to it's original orgin.There's no Batmans or Supermans , but you have comicbook characters that have their special powers mostly strength.Good flick , I'd buy it sooner than later.Get it while it's sixteen dollars.Quentin Tarantino only directed one part in this movie , don't be confsued.I must say after watching it 3 times already , I have to say it's the best movie of 2005 next to Batman Begins.I'm gonna watch it again after I edit this review at 12:42 am.
B000062XGK|4.0|This is one of those rare occassions where, in my opinion, the special edition of a film is better than the original.<br /><br />When originally released in the summer of 1989, it followed two previous underwater clunkers, DEEP STAR SIX and LEVIATHON.  The ending left too many unanswered issued and too much vagueness regarding the alien's presence on Earth.  The restored scenes released in 1994 helped to close the story gaps and make the film more complete.<br /><br />It's still a little long at its total SE running time, but still, it's better than sitting through nearly 5 hours of DUNE on the Sci-Fi channel.
B00009EJC5|5.0|I am warning you right now, because I am right, and what I am about to predict will be true. That is why I'm posting my prediction at this fine archival space, where it can be viewed by all ages of the future.  <br />In about 300 years from now, the people of the future will not have any interest in Elvis, or the Beatles, or Classical music, or anything that ever achieved #1 status on the charts.  <br />In the future, James Brown will be regarded as the greatest musical talent and biggest genious in the history of the world. And this cd will be near the top of his shrine to greatness, along with \\"Hell\\", \\"Sex Machine\\", and \\"Funky People\\".
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I HAD to buy this movie for my boyfriend (from England).  It was the only birthday present he actually requested.  We enjoyed watching a movie that actually made you laugh out loud and this one does throughout.  Love, love, love it.
B0000027RL|1.0|Pearl Jam ruled the world. And this album was so great, and Eddie Vedder was such a genious. And now its about 10 years later and this album sounds terrible because its too emotional. The best thing about \\"grudge\\" music was apathy, and this record cares too much. The guitar solos are too virtuous, and the fact that the album cover is pink always bothered me. In fact, what is the band doing, on that album cover? The Pearl Jam has made several bad decisions over the years. I recommend listening to maroon 9, stained, and lincoln park, instead.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great humor! Great action!  Great Sci-Fi!  TOO BAD there isn't anymore.  I watch this series over and over again.  It's really too bad that someone did not recognize just how fantastic this series truly was.  Can't get enough.  The combination of characters, storyline/script, plot, action, even the firefly ship is just.... (what can I say!...)...GREAT!  Please, bring it back - I'll buy it!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|In a word \\"EXCELLENT\\"! They do every song you ever wanted to hear plus a few new tunes just to add a little spice. The audio and video are as good as I have ever seen in any DVD concert. You don't even mind when they keep changing cloths from song to song. Obviously this one was put together from several nights work. Buy it, you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />
B00007GZQZ|3.0|I remember this movie being great. I also remember a few scenes that have been cut out of the DVD I purchased. All in all it was a worthy purchase, but I don't like not having the complete movie.
B00005JNTX|4.0|I always find it interesting to browse through the reviews. Everyone knows what opinions are like.......and yes everybody does have one. New and innovative films are sometimes lost on those in our society that believe that in order to enjoy a film they must be able to relate. Instead they attempt to take in a film that they do not understand and criticize harshly. When I sat down to watch this film I did not know what to expect never having read the graphic novels. Black and White film no matter in your personal camera or a Movie camera has a special quality and when mixed with just a dab of the right colors and at the right times just sets it off the same way that certain colored shirt or accessory helps bring out the best in you. The characters are amazingly compelling, semi hard to relate to with just enough 50's feel about them to give you a feeling of familiarity. This movie is not for everyone as the rating suggests due to over the top violence, sex scenes, and its very sexist portrayal of women. Interesting though that people can view the daily news of which contains the very armpit details of our world culture and then talk about it at the water cooler like its the most important thing in life, but be offended by a movie that is more akin to a piece of modern art. Open your mind, be mature about it, don't take it to seriously and just sit back and watch the fireworks that this film displays.
1572814349|3.0|This is a deck I can't say I particularly care for.  The cards are pretty, but I prefer the Williams Renaissance tarot instead.  But it's rather a beginners deck, the lack of symbolic imagery is woefully missing for an intermediate to advanced read.     Colours are ok, nothing striking, but really rather clichey, lots of black and gold.  If you go to the artists  website you can see the whole thing including version 1 which was even simplier in design. This is a really nice deck for those scared of the tarot and want an easy deck to start with though.
1594200106|5.0|I wish I had the way with words that Carlos Ruiz Zafon has. Then, perhaps, I would be able to adequately describe the way I feel about this novel. For me, this will be one of those books that will remain with me forever, the characters easily remembered, the story seared into my memory like a beautiful tattoo. I will attempt to describe what it is about and how much you should savor this book but I am sure my insufficient ability will hinder me.<br /><br />The time is postwar Barcelona, 1945, when 10-year-old Daniel Sempere wakes from a horrible nightmare. To his horror, he can no longer remember his beloved mother's face. His father tries to comfort him so to amuse his son, he takes him to a secret library; The Cemetery of Lost Books. There, Daniel is allowed to \\"adopt\\" one book. There, calling to him in that dark, mysterious chamber, Daniel finds \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by Julian Carax. Voraciously, Daniel reads his new book in just one day, and having fallen under its' spell, he begins a search that will him many years. Along the way he meets femme fatales, a witty and delightfully horny beggar, a horrifyingly disfigured man, and in turn uncovers a tale of murder, madness, and terrible secrets that many would pay any price to keep underground. And as Daniel makes his way through Barcelona society, both high and low, he comes to understand that his own part in The Shadow of the Wind is more than that of a simple reader.
B00082IJ08|3.0|I don't know how many copies I burned of \\"Gorillaz\\" to keep friends from buying that worthless batch of techno garbage with the song \\"Clint Eastwood\\".  I felt that I'd been cheated by buying it. <br /> <br />That said, I got this new \\"Demon Days\\" with the lowest of expectations.  And I must say, bravo, this is almost good enough to buy.
068987474X|5.0|This book is all too true showing the many ways guys will give excuses, and excuses that may not be so obvious to perhaps those younger and newer on the dating set.  <br /> <br />It's witty, and had me laughing skaking my head in agreement as I read what I've heard before when a guy was just not that into me.  <br /> <br />This books makes a great companion book to Stop Being the String Along, with both books I'd have to say that you will know exactly what to watch out for and what to do about it when anyone tries to pull the wool over your eyes with mixed messages and excuses. Really great books! <br /> <br />
0143034901|5.0|\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is a beautifully written, intricately-plotted novel. I was completely swept up in the story and found myself reluctant to do anything else but read on. I loved this book!
0743454537|4.0|I loved this book. The reason is that it kept my interest, kept me involved and made me want to read on.  Of course, the subject matter is very controversial, and I found myself in tears several times.  But in the end this is a well written story with moving characters, and best of all it makes you think!
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Several movie industry people were really nervous about the fully animated photorealistic characters and backgrounds from Final Fantasy: The Spirit Within. Many thought that the film would start a string of films where you wouldn't even have actors acting, just providing voices. Fortunately(or unfortunately), the film had stunning visuals but real bad story and just about everything else. So we have the digital stage, where everything besides certain props and the actors are filmed and everything else is computer. It looks great but we're a little way off from making the best use of this technology.<br /><br />Scientists keep disappearing and a man named Totenkopf is behind it. Reporter Polly Perkins(what a name huh?) finds out that scientists involved in some experiences were being taken and she finds out just in time before the Iron Giant-sized robots attack New York. So enter Sky Captain, saves Polly and takes down a robot.<br /><br />And with the help of Dex, Sky Captain's whiz-kid sidekick and one of his old flames, Franky, him and Polly try to figure out why Totenkopf is doing this and why it spells a certain end for Earth. All this gets them going all over the world flying over oceans and even swimming under them and going to Nepal to save the world.<br /><br />Like Sin City, all of the sets and backgrounds were CG while only the actors and certain interactive things were used. But the use of CG doesn't make photorealistic images that are indistinguishable from reality. They look real but you can instantly tell it isn't a real set. The film kind of has this stylized blurry look, even the actors almost have a golden shade on them.<br /><br />Along with Sky Captain, movies that have digital backlots are Sin City, Casshern(a japanese movie) and Immortel(italian) so we're still really recent with the technology but there's obviously bound to be more that'll show up.<br /><br />As a film it works mainly for its spectacle but when you start analysing everything such as plot holes, it sinks but if you don't bother thinking of it, you'll find you'll probably enjoy it. Maybe.ything such as plot holes, it sinks but if you don't bother thinking of it, you'll find you'll probably enjoy it. Maybe.
B000001E18|4.0|Joseph Muir's is right when he describes U2's major strength as diversity. After the hit success of Achtung Baby it would have been easy to do a Achtung Baby II or rehash The Joshua Tree but instead the band decided (and rightfully so) to go on an even more different path (Achtung Baby before its release was thought at the time to be a big risk because it didn't follow to normal U2 conventions).    Zoorpa is an add on in some ways to Achtung but more soft. There are great songs Some days are better than others, Crazy Day, fantastic songs Zooropa, Babyface and the classic songs Numb, Stay, For the first time. The album almost hits 5 actually but I feel it is more to do with the album being a bit uneven (especially in the middle) than lack of quality.    Zooropa is an important album as it would see an important change of direction & also signalled that U2 were prepared to change though not sell out with the times (something they've sadly done from 2000 onwards!!!). So whilst War, Joshua, & Achtung made them, Zooropa kept them in the public but most importantly their fans interest. In short without this U2 would probably be a mere memory now!!!!
B000000XCA|5.0|THE great ccr album.It will always be best known for being the home of \\"Proud Mary\\",but even better stuff is here.\\"Born On the Bayou\\"\\"Bootleg\\"\\"Penthouse Pauper\\".Still sounds as good today as it did when my friends and I were wearing the 8-track tape out over 30 years ago.
B000001FS3|5.0|U2 having already found critical aclaim with their two previous releases the 1983 album War & 1985's The Unforgettable Fire. And after a string of UK top 10 hits, and with The Smiths on their way out U2 were easily Europe's biggest band and both those albums had made severe inroads into the US top 20 albums chart, so all that remained to truely conquer was the big one, the USA!!!    Everyone knows that the first four songs are probably the most perfect songs ever to start an album and because of this when you first listen to the album it seems that these are the only four that are great. It is more though to do with the fact that the album was recorded in two different locations, the first four in one & the others in an other. Also that these songs blow your mind so much that it takes you the rest of the album to recover, so I've decided that I'm going to base my review from song 5!!!    Running to stand still is a wonderful mid-tempo song which at first goes unnoticed but after a few listens is very hypnotic. Whilst Running hill mining town is one of my favourite U2 songs, it starts slow before going into a riprourus chours, it's classic U2. In God's country sounds like an adaptation of something from The Unforgettable Fire, whilst Trip through your wires is the first blues based U2 song I can remember listening too. One Tree hill is a beautifull crafted soft classic, whilst Exit & Mothers of the dissapeared softly close the album!!!    At the end of it all The Joshua Tree would get U2 what they most desired, well not forgeting the constant touring that went along with this album. But by the end of it all The Joshua Tree would establish U2 as the worlds biggest band. And by the time Achtung Baby was released they became one of the all time great bands!!!!
B00005T30L|5.0|This movie rocks! I rented it like a week ago and was blown away! The day after I saw it, I went to Blockbuster to bring it back and was ready to buy it but.....THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT! What a joke! I mean, seriously, some of their movies for sell are horrid and they don't have Ghost World? <br />This movie is quite original and is one of the few movies without any violence whatsoever. The movie is about two friends, Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) who just graduated from high school. They have no plans to go to college but instead plan on moving in together in their own place. Enid is mad because she has to go to summer art school and doesn't really get along with her dad or his girlfriend. She doesn't have any friends besides Rebecca and Josh, a guy whom she enjoys bugging. Rebecca and her basically just spend their days mocking people and following random people around, criticizing and laughing at them. Their newest victim is Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a nerd that sells records for a living. But, Enid starts to really like him and they become good friends. While Rebecca and Enid's relationship goes downhill, Enid's relationship with Seymour gets stronger.  <br />My interprtation of this movie to me is that most of the people are ghosts, especially to Enid, meaning that she can't realte to them and doesn't get along with them, therefore, she can't even see them. This line by Enid perfectly explains the title: \\"I can't relate to 99% of humanity.\\" <br />This movie will make you cry, laugh your head off, nodd in agreement and more. Some moments are downright hilarious while others are very sad. This is one movie that I will never forget. NEVER. <br />Lastly, the acting in the movie is incredible, notably by Thora Birch. She is a rising sensation that showed off all of her talent in this movie. Steve Buscemi is also quite remarquable in a supporting role. Scarlet Johansson also does a nice job.  <br />I hope that this review will make you want to see this excellent movie that is unlike anything that you have ever seen before.  <br /> <br />\\"Move it! Come on! What, are we in slo motion?\\"
B000001DTM|5.0|Achtung Baby would mark a change in direction for U2 but oh how different it could have been had Bono & The Edge listened to Larry Mullen Jnr & Adam Clayton, the bass & drummer of U2 respectively, who wanted to stay with U2's similar successful formulars of War, Unforgettable Fire & The Joshua Tree. But Bono & Edge won the argument & got their way and the rest as they say is history!!!    Whilst Joshua Tree & the live film album Rattle & Hum was a more American based efforts, Joshua Tree went the more European musical direction (something that U2 would go towards throughout the 90's) with Edge using guitar effects similar to those Bowie used during his Berlin sessions in the late 70's whilst sampling ideas from genres such as House, Garage, and even Techno, Achtung Baby certainly was attempting something!!!    Indeed the new style would encourage Edge to redo the original guitar solo of Mysterious Ways, adapting the solo to the new methods eventually resulting in its now familuar format. In response Bono did One, a song about loss, it even helped calm tensions down between the band about their new sound!!!    There are even dark aspects of Achtung Baby too, So Cruel, Acrobat & Love is Blindness, are though dark and mysterious, have also a kind of class in them. This would be a method further explored in latter releases in the 90's, first Zooropa & more throughly in the very underated yet for some reason the critics hated it, and also its sales made it a comercial flop, the 1997 release Pop!!!    There are of course the hit songs, the forementioned Mysterious Ways, & One, Whose gonna ride your wild horses (strangely left of the Greatest 90's hits package) & Even better than the real thing. These are probably the songs you're most familar with if you've never heard this album before, although Last night on Earth was also released as a single. But Achtung Baby like The Joshua Tree is more than just about the hits!!!!    The album moved its political intensions from theevery day life of people (though still mentioned in songs such as Until the end of the world & So Cruel) to dealing with subject very hot at the time and still hot today AIDS. This is because some of the songs were used as short videos to highlight the dangers of the disease, i.e. One, So Cruel, & Love is blindness!!!!    At the end of it all Achtung Baby isn't just a U2 album about just U2, or an album just made for the sake of it (like their releases since 2000) but it depicts what was going on around the world, & even today alot of the messages in the album are important if not more important now than they even were back in 1991, i.e the aids crisis that still exists in Africa!!!    Actung Baby isn't only one of the best albums of its generation but of all time. U2 may have been ruining their reputation since 2000 but they can live comfortably knowing that whatever happens that they always have The Joshua Tree & Achtung Baby to pull back on, just in case any one forgets how great this once great band was!!!!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I really like the latest work of slipknot they are continue to be one of my favorite bands and never cease to impress with the subliminal verses, good vocals, and kick ass guitar riffs and oversound makes this one a keeper. The highlights of the album include  Duality, Vermillion, and my favorite Pulse of the Maggots
B000001FA4|3.0|Though I agree with the last reviewer that this album definitely needs a remastering, it is one of U2's more overated efforts, but still miles better than anything U2 have done in the 2000's, especially All that you can't leave behind, ok that wouldn't be hard anyway, I know, but The Unforgettable Fire also includes some favourite U2 songs of mine too!!!!    A Sort of homecoming is a great track, kinda similar to what was to come on The Joshua Tree, whilst Pride (in the name of love) is definitely one of the best U2 anthems. It also includes the punk like Wire, the title track The Unforgettable Fire & one of my other favourite U2 tracks Bad. This song was also performed by the band in their Live Aid performance!!!    The rest is kinda mediocre, not for lack of invention though, it just that some of the ideas didn't quite come of here as well as the others, they must have saved their best for you know what. But I suppose the other songs still make it a great listen especially for die hard U2 fans, and the great songs really are great!!!!    To conclude The Unforgettable Fire is definitely a change from its stronger predecessor, the U2 breakthrough album War, although brave it didn't quite work as an album, but it includes some smashing great tracks as I forementionedn, and if anything it was a sign of things just coming down the road. I say it's definitely worth a listen!!!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|this is seriousy an awsome album i loved fiercly eight out of eleven songs on this album. It was a little short but there is more to come and i can't wait.  <br /> <br />1. Soldier Side- Just the intro pretty good  7 of 10 <br /> <br />2. B.Y.O.B- This is best and most well written song on the album but it's not my fav because i've heard about a billion times already on the radio 9.5 of 10 <br /> <br />3. Revanga- this song kicks ass my second favorite on the album the rythem beat vocals this is really an awsome song the moves along at a quick pace 9.75 out of 10 <br /> <br />4. Cigaro- The first few times i heard this song i didn't like it but soon i loved it has wacky lyrics that actually are trying to delivar a political statement though you wouldn't know if you weren't paying attention it is a great sounding song that you can sing along two 8.5 out of ten <br /> <br />5. Radio/Video- another great song bit repetitve but still good rythmic song 8 out of ten <br /> <br />6. The song makes me feel like i'm on cocaine- for some reason i didn't think much of this song not sure why by no means bad but somethings missing 7 out of ten <br /> <br />7. Violent Pornography- the best song on the album just awsome everything, it will also make you feel bad if your a pervert ten out of ten <br /> <br />8. Question- great thoughtful song somewhat slower and quiter than most tracks but is really good 9 out of ten <br /> <br />9. Sad Statue- strong political statement in a great sonding song 8.75 out of ten <br /> <br />10. Old School Hollywood- basic message some good parts in song but really not that good a basic average song. 7 out of ten <br /> <br />11. Lost in Hollywood- i was a little annoyed by the two hollywood songs but this one is the better of the two slower and well sung its a good likeable sad song 8 out of ten <br /> <br /> <br />overall this is a must have and just about every song is worth it go buy this now!
B000001EAQ|4.0|Pop has some of my favourite U2 songs, Discoteque, Mofo, Staring at the sun & Wake up Deadman!!!    Another interesting story is that Bono doesn't like the album, but this is often misquoted. The real story is that U2 has already booked their Pop Mart tour and it was scheduled to begin before U2 could actually finish the album. So in a panic the band decided to rush the finish. For example the Last night on earth was supposedly rushed & not done to how U2 wanted it, yet this is a great song!!!    Therefore there are a few iffy songs like Miami & If you wear that velvet dress, but the rest though admittingly different (just listen to Mofo) are great & actually it is more like how U2 would approach hard Pop, very intersting & enjoyable listening, and oddly never ever sounding dated, unlike their more recent releases!!!    On Pop Bono said that it starts like a party but ends up as a funeral, that's exactly it, though I'd describe it more as starting in the light (the first three songs) whilst slowly fading into the dark, and the last song Wake Up Deadman certainly ends the album in a real darky merky place but actually it's one of my favourite U2 songs ever!!!    The big question is what happened after??????
B0009MDPYM|2.0|_Constantine_ is a blasphemous occult movie starring Keanu Reeves as John Constantine, a suicide trapped between heaven and hell, and Rachel Weisz as his side-kick, the sister of a suicide and possessor of occult powers, which fails to deliver.  The movie presents itself as religious farce, but is simply too disconnected to achieve anything even remotely resembling coherence.  We are led to believe that demons actively battle angels on earth; yet, at the same time we are told that they cannot cross over.  We are provided with disconnected images involving various occult practices, including the use of water as an occult lubricant to facilitate travel to the other world, as well as the use of an old electric chair, formerly used to fry criminals, now used to achieve occult transcendence.  The journeys of the main character to hell are unconvincing, and the plot is virtually nonexistent.  Apparently, the Spear of Longinus, the spear used to pierce the side of Christ as he lay dying on the Cross and believed to give its bearer control over the destiny of the world, makes an appearance; however, the role of this occult relic in the main storyline seems contrived.  The movie claims to be based on Catholic theology, but entirely neglects the role of Purgatory in the process of Salvation.  Lucifer also makes an appearance, but his bare-footed character is not at all how I would imagine the Prince of Darkness.  God does not appear in this movie!  As others have noted, about the only thing redeeming this movie at all is the performance of Rachel Weisz.  She does a great job, but unfortunately the rest of this movie is so much hodge-podge glued together that it fails to deliver.
B000001F3C|5.0|War is where it all began. It is funny as War is a strange name for a breakthrough album, but that is what War was for U2 a very big breakthrough, and 22 years later it is still their most political release, and is oddly therefore the bands most back to roots album, as some of the issues discussed were to do with British & Irish relations during the 1980's!!!    And what a way to start things off, Sunday Bloody Sunday, along with one of the most recognisable drum intros of all time (perhaps only second to Zeppelin's Rock & Roll) & it makes me laugh when U2 go on today about How to dismantle an atomic bomb as a back to roots album because Sunday Bloody Sunday, a song about the IRA British conflict is the most roots song U2 have ever done!!!!    Seconds is a typical U2 anthem, well if you can call it typical, I mean at the time it wouldn't have been because this would have been many people's first exposure to U2, but still it's great. Whilst New Years Day is a song to be played at every New Years Day party enough said, well actually its another song about The IRA & Britain & it was also the bands first ever top 10 UK hit. 40 & Refugee follows the U2 early punk influences whilst Drowning Man could be considered U2's first classic mid-tempo song. Two Hearts is a classic, great chours, one of U2's best unknown rock anthems. Red Light is similar though light weight compared to Two Hearts it's still great, whilst Surrender is another great rock anthem, I especially like the children chant near the end, kinda Floyd like but still brilliant. And I have to say that Like a Song is one of the best \\"songs that sound imcomplete\\" I've ever heard, it kinda finishes before it should, which is still kinda irritating but doesn't really spoil the album!!!    OK War isn't up there with The Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby. But for sheer fun & quality it definitely deserves its place along one of U2's greatest achievements. It was the first U2 album I brought and it was enough to get me hooked on their other stuff so I definitely recommend this to anyone wondering what Bono & co. are all about!!!!
B0001IN07Q|1.0|A very poor recording. Loses a lot being recorded off the speakers in that venue. Could have been a great C.D. if it had not been recorded live.  Michael has a fantastic talent, but it is wasted on this.  I would send this back, if I could.  Buy the <br />\\"It's Time\\" recording, if you wish to listen to real talent, and <br />an outstanding musical background.  I would not wish this one on <br />my worst enemy.
B000001FS6|2.0|Before I start Desire, Angel of Harlem, & All I want are excellent songs, and if you have most of their albums & are big U2 fans and haven't brought this yet then why not as these are better to have on this album than to buy them on the best of 80's package that already mostly has songs you own, & there are some excellent live performances too Bullet in the blue sky, Pride (in the name of love) & the gospel version of Still haven't found what I'm looking for is very interesting!!!    But...please read on if you're new to U2!!!    There are very big bad moves...For example, well it's mainly this, the choice of cover songs, Helter Skelter & All along the watch tower, very bad moves, maybe this is a personal issue for me as Helter Skelter is one of my favourite Beatles songs and it's performed too slow, whilst Dylan's All along the watchtower was done miles better by Hendrix!!!    Add this too the iffy performance of Silver & Gold, and the ill fated When love comes to town, along with iffy tunes such as Love Rescue me & God part II, then one soon realises that although Hattle & Hum came only a year after the 1987 master class The Joshua Tree it is hardly an essential U2 album release, but there are ways you could forgive this!!!    U2 were on a crest of a wave, the unexpected popularity of The Joshua Tree not only a big US hit album but also worldwide. From being a respected Irish rock band (probably the best Irish rock band) they were suddenly the biggest thing on Earth. So one can safely say that Rattle & Hum was more a tribute to the fans & U2's influences or more simply put, the things that had helped them become famous!!!!    U2 were obviously saving themselves after The Joshua Tree, and in hindsight thank God for that because it would actually be 4 years before their next official album release, the 1991 album Actung Baby. But unlike their more recent 2000 releases that was actually four years that really really were well worth the wait. So I suppose one should really forgive them 100% then, I mean it is U2!!!!    Worlds biggest band 1987-200?  Worlds best band 1987-1997
B000002J09|5.0|This Cd is so awesome you'd be missing something if you don't buy it. I listen to it all the time and even hear the songs in many car commercials. So if you like good rock and are thinking about a new Cd, this one should be added to your collection.
0307165485|4.0|My dad read this book to me as a child, and he offered to give it to me for my son, who is 9 months old. I decided to buy it instead because some of the pages were missing from my parents' copy and some of them were from stories that were my favorites. It has stories that have only a few words a page for much smaller children, so that it can be used for children as young as my son up to the kindergarten age.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a book of stories to read to their child.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|Sigh. Clive Cussler's novels are fun beach or poolside reading where reading a 400 page book in two sittings seems like an accomplishment. At the end, you never really remember much out of it, but at least you had a good time turning the pages.  <br /> <br />This didn't quite translate to on-screen. The basic plot of the movie is this: Matt McConaughey and Penelope Cruz are very good looking and stuff blows up. Unlike Indiana Jones or James Bond (in the good ones), this Dirk fellow never really impresses. He has tremendous luck and a wicked sucker-punch for a diver, but there's no depth. There's no martini or irational fear of snakes. There really isn't anything about this character that I am inclined to remember. The audience is simply told that this is our hero, and shown that he looks even sexier after a few days in the desert.  <br /> <br />What little comic relief is provided is unremarkable, but well-timed. The major action sequences are fun enough, but often too predictable. I sort of liked the pointless plot turns here and there, that the bad-guys are not after the same goal as our intrepidly attractive explorers, but in the end it felt too convenient that these two motives should cross paths in the vast expanse of the world's largest desert.  <br /> <br />That aside, the villain is played well if not originally (you will remeber this character from the later two Matrix films). This movie was pretty bad, I'm not going to lie. But it makes for a decent rental, I've seen far worse movies than this.
B000056HE9|5.0|This old movie depicts the real meaning of the Christmas season.  It is refreshing to watch such a wholesome movie with some of our greatest actors/actresses of a bygone era.  Would highly recommend it as one of the great holiday movies of all times.
B00005JMXX|1.0|This movie is utterly unremarkable. I reccomend it to no one. I enjoyed films such as Independance Day and even parts of Godzilla. But this movie has virtually no redeeming qualities. We have seen special effects by now. Recent films (War of the Worlds, Lord of the Rings, The Island) have shown us that special effects can be used to augment good storytelling to make compelling films.  <br /> <br />In this case however, the effects stand alone, and there aren't nearly enough of them. There are probably a grand total of 10 minutes of \\"shock and awe\\" time in this movie, worth catching on HD HBO, but certainly not worth the price of a DVD or movie ticket.  <br /> <br />The actors are not to blame here, Quaid, Holm,and Gyllenhall clearly did what they were asked. However the story and dialogue are so flat I never particularly cared what happened to any of the characters. <br /> <br />I was expecting a fun sci-fi effects romp, which I got for about 10-15 minutes of this film. The rest was just ghastly, ghastly filler.
B0009SS00A|1.0|I'm a fool to myself ...  <br /> <br />Having read The Da Vinci Code a couple of weeks ago, I should really have known better than to start on another Dan Brown novel - but I picked up a copy of Digital Fortress to pass a few hours ... Turned out to be minutes ...  <br /> <br />I was struck, in The Da Vinci Code, by Brown's incomprehensible propensity to use the idiomatic phrase \\"in hopes of\\" where most would use \\"in the hope of\\" - the term was used by ALL characters AND the narrator, thereby failing to take an opportunity to differentiate characters, and revealing too much of the author himself. Well, proof positive that Brown is not a good writer (I'm distinguishing the writing from the stories here) is shown in the occurrence of the phrase several times in Digital Fortress too.  <br /> <br />In addition, he takes great pains to describe his heroine as the stereotypical brace-toothed ugly duckling turned beautiful swan, with an IQ of 170, and who is considered to be one of the brightest people ever to walk the earth. He then uses her to ask simple and straightforward questions of her boss for the sake of narrative exposition - nothing wrong with that per se, but it totally undermines his narrative description of her abilities!  <br /> <br />Similarly, the start of chapter 7: \\"Susan's mind was racing - Ensei Tankudo wrote a program that creates unbreakable codes! She could barely grasp the thought ... \\" - Even I could \\"grasp\\" that idea - what's the excuse of a 170 IQ, brilliant mathematician ... ?  <br /> <br />If that's how intellectual \\"brightness\\" is defined these days, it's surely no surprise that this year's A-Level results (in Britain) show a 97% pass rate.  <br /> <br />Oh yes - and he also says that Julius Caesar \\"was the first code-writer in history\\" ...  <br /> <br />Not true - off the top of my head, Herodotus (484 to 425 BC) says the Spartans had several clever code systems. One involved writing messages on, say, the inside of a leather belt that had been wrapped around a hexagonal (or octagonal) stick (the skytal), with the individual consecutive letters of words appearing on different 'winds' of the belt (or strip of material); when the belt was unwound from the skytal the lettering was unintelligible. The messenger would then wear the belt as normal, and would deliver it to the recipient, who would also have a skytal of the same size, wrap the belt/strip around it and read off the message.  <br /> <br />So, yet again, Brown's research is found wanting. <br /> <br />Needless to say, the book is now on its way to a landfill site somewhere. <br />
B00004VWAF|5.0|The negative reactions from both critics and Miles Davis fans kept me from exploring this album for a long time.  Listening to Bill Laswell's reconstructions of Miles work on Panthalassa convinced me to set aside my prejudices.    This is an extremely difficult album to rate.  If I rate it based on genius and vision it is easily five stars.  Much of what Miles was reaching for has only been realized in the last 10 years of electronica, d'n'b, illbient, acid jazz and the more adventurous channels of world music.  In fact, it has taken more than two decades for much of the musical community to catch up to Miles on this album, and literally 100s of talented artists to explore all of the implications of this disc.    Rated for impact on other musicians, it is again a 5.  Some artists may well have come by the influence second or third hand, but this is the root of a great deal of 90s music.    Even other visionaries from Miles' own period took years to catch up.  Brian Eno's \\"Before and After Science\\" followed \\"On the Corner\\" by some 5 years.  But listening to \\"Black Satin\\" and \\"Helen Butte\\" it is easy to recognize Eno's debt.  Individual ideas and structures from these tracks show up in pieces like \\"Energy Fools the Magician\\" and \\"Kurt's Rejoinder\\" and even \\"No One Receiving\\" distilling the essence of one aspect of \\"On the Corner\\" into a more listener friendly brew.    In fact, one of the weaknesses of \\"On the Corner\\" is that Miles' fellow musicians, as brilliant, talented and inspired as they were, just couldn't see far enough ahead to fully catch and follow his vision.  It was 1972, and Miles was asking them to invent the 21st century.    But rated purely for listening pleasure, the album is at best a 3.  There are some very engaging and \\"catchy\\" moments (listen to \\"Black Satin\\" 3 times, then try to get the main trumpet hook out of your head).  Still, much of the album is difficult listening.  Rewarding, but not all that entertaining.  Admirable, but often not all that engaging.    I'm glad I set aside the prejudices.  For me this is a must have and must study CD.  Although I highly recommend Laswell's Panthalassa CD (\\"He Loved Him Madly\\" is a masterpiece), the version of \\"Black Satin\\" on this disc is vastly superior.  I'll be coming back to this CD for years to come.
B00006IUL6|5.0|\\"Insomnia\\" is a breakthrough movie, defying the genre pigeonhole. I have never been a fan of cops/crime stories per se. I also have no interest in 'mob' movies; consequently, I've actually not seen much of Al Pacino before. Wow; what a great actor, and he is onscreen nearly every moment from start to finish. Will Dormer (Pacino) is a most compelling character, struggling increasingly with his demons as he tries to stay focused despite being severely sleep-deprived, having been sent to Alaska during the \\"white nights\\" season to solve a criminal case. The story is presented in such a way as to engage and involve the viewer in Dormer's dilemma(s), and the Alaskan landscape (though I think most of it was actually Vancouver) is breathtakingly beautiful, making me wish I'd seen this movie in a theater. However, had I seen the theatrical trailer first I never would have taken an interest in \\"Insomnia\\". The trailer makes it look like a typical formulaic action movie; ugh. Instead, I read between the lines of others' opinions and trusted my instincts that \\"Insomnia\\" is a movie well worth viewing. Now please permit me to pass along my own recommendation: don't lose any sleep over it, just see \\"Insomnia\\".

185984054X|1.0|Well, it seems anti-catholicism is everywhere these days.  First John Cornwell's \\"Hitler's Pope\\" now this wonderful book.  I guess the \\"enlightened\\" people of the Nobel Prize commitee must not be as smart as we thought.  After all, they actually gave Mother a Nobel Peace Prize. I suppose Martin King and Albert Einstein must have been frauds too, or perhaps Hitchens (like Cornwell) may a few facts crossed.  I'm just glad there is a generation of Catholic Apologists who can shed light on this type of \\"investigative jouirnalism\\".

B000000OU0|5.0|First, let me start of by saying this is one of the best sounding live albums I've ever heard. It was really mixed well to make the music almost of perfect quality. <br /> <br />But what makes this album so great is the song selections. It starts off with four new songs, including one that charted (Get Over It). I'm not going to judge this album based on those songs. Then the next eleven songs are all classics, six of which were charted hits by the Eagles, four Eagles songs which were never released or did not chart, and one Henley song that never charted. <br /> <br />The most well known of these songs is of course Hotel California. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM JUST FOR THAT SONG! There are plenty of albums that have that song and other songs buy different artists for non-Eagles fans who loved that song. This album is for classic Eagles fans. Other well-known songs the hits Tequila Sunrise, Wasted Time, I Can't Tell You Why, Take it Easy, and Life in the Fastlane. Despite having five number one hits, only Hotel California makes this album. <br /> <br />But the best songs on this album were not hits. The Last Resort, which was never released as a single, is possibly one of the twenty best songs ever written. It, along with Peaceful Easy Feeling, is what is the Eagles. Peaceful Easy Feeling (which sadly is left off of this album) is the showcase of the group's \\"Country-Rock\\" era, which The Last Resort is that song which crossed the line into rock while still saving a little bit of the Eagle's heritage. This is one of the best songs ever written. <br /> <br />Another classic on this album is Desperado, which was a country hit but not a rock hit. This is another great song, even for rock fans. <br /> <br />And for those who love Henley, he threw in New York Minute. I, personally would rather he put in The End of the Innocence or The Heart of the Matter (which happen to be two of the few good songs of the '80s), but I know a lot of people like this song. <br /> <br />The onlytwo songs left out of this concert that should have been in it were Peaceful Easy Feeling and the #1 hit New Kid in Town. Those were two classic Eagles songs that would have made this the perfect collection. <br /> <br />Even though it is not perfect, it is great quality music and a great collection of songs. This album is for the true Eagles fan.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Better than the previous four live-action Batman theatrical releases put together - by far - this is the Batman movie we never thought we'd see.  THIS is the Batman and the Batman mythos of the comic books, and while it's not dead-on in every aspect, it doesn't have to be.  The heart and soul and feel of the books are here at last; for the first time a Batman that actually Is Batman in more than name and appearance is present (the previous closest was the Batman of the 90s animated series and the animated \\"Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm\\" and its sequels - all recommended and all better than the previous live-action stuff, although toned down and simplified from the modern comics).   <br /> <br />   Much more believable than previous entries, and with far greater characterization; a few of the characters are not quite in line with their comic counterparts (Ra's Al Ghul, for example) but they're close enough, they capture the essential esscences of their characters (something I don't believe the previous four movies even tried to do), and it's not mandatory - or even preferable - to bring in a carbon copy of any given comic arc anyway; merely that it be in the spirit of and faithful to the source material.  Which, again, is something that I don't think was really an objective for the previous films (Certainly not for \\"Batman And Robin\\"). <br /> <br />When I first heard that there was going to be another Batman movie I wasn't really interested; when I saw some of the still shots and recalled how filmmakers have in recent years shown that it is possible to do comic adaptations right (\\"X-Men\\", \\"Spider-Man\\", etc.) I began to become a little hopeful; when I learned that David S. Goyer - who's written DC series like \\"JSA\\" as well as worked on movies like \\"Dark City\\" I began to very cautiously believe that we might have something approaching what I wanted the movie to be.  It turns out it didn't just approach it, it was it: a Batman movie that reaches the level of the Batman comics of current times. <br /> <br />Beginning in the past with Bruce Wayne as a child and flashing forward to his years in exile, believed dead while really honing his skills even as he's lost in his own inner demons, and continuing on with his first meetings with Ra's Al Ghul and later Jim Gordon - not yet Gotham's Commissioner, just an honest and decent sergeant doing his best in a seriously corrupt city (incidentally, this is the first of the live-action theatrical movies that hasn't treated Gordon as either an afterthought or an outright joke; kudos to the filmmakers for treating this character with the respect he deserves, and kudos to Gary Oldman for playing the part so brilliantly.) and into direct confrontation with the crimelords of Gotham and, later, more exotic adversaries, \\"Batman Begins\\" is a roaring success on every level, including romantic and comedic touches that don't seem the slightest bit out of place with the intensity of the movie.  Christian Bale, Katie Holmes, Ken Watanabe, the previously noted Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and the whole cast do outstanding jobs.  I'm not even going to mention all the characters who turn up here; it's better when you discover it on your own (though not everyone who's familiar to the comic readers will be known by the larger audience).  Some of the grandest action in film history - very, very rarely has such a scale of action come off this realistically. <br /> <br />For a sequel (assuming there is one) I'd say forget about tying it into the previous movies (I don't mean to keep dumping on them, they were usually entertaining, but they just weren't the real deal); it's too late for that anyway considering that \\"Batman Begins\\" retold the origin in a different way than 1989's \\"Batman\\".  Just go on from here, keep bringing in people on both sides of the camera as talented as those who worked on this (keep Bale, Freeman, Michael Caine, and every other performer who fits each script; feel free to bring back Goyer and director/co-writer Christopher Nolan, but if you also need new blood for some of the future movies consider looking to the likes of Devin Grayson, Greg Rucka and Doug Moench) and the sky's the limit.  And if you see this and want more, you don't even have to wait for the sequel; check out the comics, many of which are available here on Amazon in Trade Paperback or Hardcover form. <br /> <br />Beyond 10/10 <br /> <br />
B000069CWE|4.0|In my opinion this was better than the Jay-Z mashup, 1, because it was a smarter album and 2, because of the variety of underground rappers it featured on it. Coll.Course, was simply a cross between accapella flows with the other album's beats mixed with decent production, but hey, the public ate it up, and the whole issue about segragating hip hop from rock, times are changin',so go w/ it or dont listen. Definitely pick this one up, and just let your little bro or sis pick up the JayZ version......One more thing, how many time is LP gonna remix Hybrid Theory?
B000063DIH|5.0|\\"Fear Of The Dark\\" is so good it's almost scary.  Ranging from traditional Maiden-type songs like \\"From Here To Eternity\\" to very unorthodox material from the band like \\"Chains Of Misery\\" and \\"The Apparition\\", there's not a song on here that doesn't cut it as a true great.  Yes, I realize that it's practically metal heresy to admit to liking \\"The Apparition\\" and \\"Weekend Warrior\\", but I love them.  They're extremely different and fresh, and while it's true that albums like \\"Killers\\" and \\"The Number Of The Beast\\" don't have a bad track on them either, I'd take Apparition and Weekend over \\"Genghis Khan\\" and \\"Invaders\\" if forced to make a choice.  (Then again, perhaps I should note that I also love the \\"Virtual XI\\" album). <br /> <br />\\"Be Quick Or Be Dead\\" gets the disc off to a rip-roaring start with one of the best and most memorable riffs in history tearing out right at the opening bell, and the album doesn't falter from then on in.  This is arguably Bruce Dickinson's best overall vocal performance on a full album (and I stress 'arguably', \\"Piece Of Mind\\", \\"Accident Of Birth\\" and \\"Rock In Rio\\" are also contenders in this area) and the mixture of such strongly varied material as \\"Be Quick Or Be Dead\\", \\"Childhood's End\\", \\"The Apparition\\" and the \\"Fear Of The Dark\\" title track pays off in spades. The tremendous drum intro to \\"The Fugitive\\", the haunting voice-echo effects on \\"Fear Of The Dark\\", the vast gauntlet of emotions present in one track like \\"Fear Is The Key\\", and totally unMaiden-like but somehow perfectly fitting choruses in \\"Chains Of Misery\\": the list of pluses to this album could go on and on.  Utterly essential, and quite possibly the best album of 1992.
B0007P3582|1.0|i dont know what is wrong with kids these days. look im a college professor and i teach poetry. rap basically is poetry and i love rap. but come on. im going to say this to everybody they do have to admit. 50 is no true rapper. first of all he made fun of ja rule for singing in his songs.in this album he does the same thing in some of his songs. so what if he got shot 20 times or whatever. i got stabbed by one of my students. he has the worst voice. he cant write any poetry. he is a middle school dropout. 2pac is a good example he actually studied in school and tried hard. i dont get u kids anymore. ive had it.em is not a good example but u can see that he tried hard to get where he is. i have to admit he can be catchy but that does not mean anything. rap is words people. not beat. words. and im black so trust me im right.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a wonderful trip 500 years into the future.  A terrific and entertaining combination of humor, action, wit, love, and of course, science fiction, I couldn't love the series more. The show follows a group of nine people aboard a spaceship named Serenity of the firefly class, named because of shape of the ship. The people aboard all have their own interesting history, which didn't get to be fleshed out because the show was cut short so abruptly. <br /> <br />Firefly is my new not-so-secret obsession. The unique thing about this show is that it makes the future real and acessible, not far-fetched.  All of the characters are engaging, the stories are gripping, the sets and lighting are some of the best I've ever seen in a TV show, and of course the acting/writing/directing is wonderful.  If you want something totally entertaining of which you don't have to buy ten seasons, get this show, even if you've never seen it before.  <br /> <br />My only complaint is that there are only 14 episodes and it leaves you wanting more. So stick it to FOX for cancelling the show and buy this DVD! For the unsatisfied, there is a motion picture coming out based on the series in Fall 2005.
B00000JCOV|1.0|slinging snot is what this cd will have you doing only after a few songs. it's hard to understand why so many are taken in by bands such as these slipknot, mudstain i mean mudvayne, static cling oops static x, bands like these have the same tuned down guitars, the vocals all sound like someone sitting on the toilet trying to squeeze out a turd. the same chords are played throughout the entire cd, no guitar solos, what happened to the days when bands had guitar solos? the whole look of the band makes them look like they should be in the circus, underground metal does not get radio air play, that should be your first clue this is not metal stay away from this cd and others like it. boring,un-original, just lame.
B00006LI4S|5.0|I don't typically write reviews, so what follows may be a bit unorthodox... <br /> <br />From a musician's perspective, this is definitely one of the best DVDs available.  Music is a big part of my life; I've got over 1,000 records and over 800 CDs, so you can imagine how big a part of music my life is.  I've got a slew of music DVDs and none of them move me as much as this one.  I just keep putting it on and putting it on again.  Even my wife keeps asking me to put it on. <br /> <br />If you're looking for trite recitations of old Floyd stuff don't come here.  The handful of Floyd songs that David does are pretty much completely reworked for the veritable chamber orchestra he's enlisted to help him.  There are some Syd songs, which I thought was a nice touch.  I could've done without the guest appearances on Comfortably Numb.  But other than that, the performances were wonderfully arranged and I loved the intimate setting. <br /> <br />Spare Digits is by far my most favorite extra.  They compiled all the solos that didn't make it onto the main feature and show only David while he's playing them.  There is behind the scenes footage from rehearsals and also several videos featuring David Gilmour that are otherwise unrelated to the set. <br /> <br />I'll leave you with this: I can't stop watching this DVD!!!
B000AP04EW|2.0|Brad Pitt (12 Monkeys, Troy) and Angelina Jolie (Alexander, Shark Tale) star as Mr. John and Mrs. Jane Smith who, at the beginning of the movie are at a marraige counselour for what you say, oh, there isnt any erotic heat between the 2 of them anymore. Then it goes on to showing how the 2 met in Bogota Columbia, how they fell in love and how 5 or 6 years later after their married, both find out that they are assassins...hmmm..what makes it even worse is that they were sent to whack each other off, not the target they both were after. So, the 2 try to kill each other, punching each other, shooting at each other, slapping, smashing each others heads into a wall or glass and in the end they find that their getting off on the fact their trying to kill one another...interesting. Doug Liman, has done comedy and action before but this is the first time he has meshed those 2 categories together which let's down some of the fun. The fact of the matter is, is that both stars have their moments but for me, it doesnt cut it at all. Vince Vaughn (Swingers, Wedding Crashers) who plays Pitt's boss is best out of the wasted supporting characters, who lives with his mom still (\\"Mom, I almost just killed you right there!). Adam Brody (Grind, TV'S THE O.C) wearing a Fight Club t-shirt when the man who starred in it was sitting across from him, yeah, ok. Another thing I hated was that it got to boring when they would find guns in hidden compartments...I mean, enough already. Also starring Kerry Washington (She Hate Me, Ray). Actor Keith David (Pitch Black) played Jolie's mystery boss and Actor William Fichtner (GO, The Longest Yard) was the voice of the marraige counselor.  <br />
0060012218|3.0|Most of the characters in this book don't break out of their stereotypical niches. Min, the best friend, is smart and compassionate all the way through, never faltering. The jocks at the jock table are crude and cruel. The characters who are supposed to change do it in predictable ways. The main character goes from not speaking out to speaking out, and the outcast turns out to be a good guy. No surprises.<br /><br />That said, the writing is smooth and the main character is easy to identify with in his uncertainty. It's a fast read that never makes you wince, despite the overabundance of coincidences.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for grades 6 to 8, not for high school. The issues and conflicts (scandal over the health teacher putting a condom on a cucumber, GASP!) will be a retread for high school readers.

B0009VRHLK|1.0|Anybody who claims this is a great film is simply being pretentious. period.  There is no way a normal, critical adult human being could sit through the 118 or the 92 minute version without being absolutely bored out of their mind. Even the clever plot twist at the end fails to redeem this steaming pile of indie crap.  Sure, you'll have the art-house junkies who will try to define themselves as hipper-then-thou by showering the flick with such praises as \\"unconventional\\", \\"out of the mainstream\\" and \\"uncompromising\\".  If I was to film a smear of dog excrement on the sidewalk for 2 hours, they'd praise it just as well (probably pointing out its poignant commentary on society's imprisonment of the human soul, or some crap like that).  Do yourself a favor, if you made the mistake of renting it already (or...worse...buying it!), go directly to Chloe's stellar performance at the film's closure (because, after all... you KNOW that is why you got it in the first place!) and put it back in its box.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Before this movie, Batman had never really been accurately portrayed on the silver screen. But, now he has...  This IS the definitive Batman film.  Not only is it a great superhero/action film - it is a wonderful film in general.<br /><br />Batman Begins is a reboot for the Batman movie franchise; it is in no way linked to the previous 4 movies in any way (and thankfully, in my opinion).  It is an origin story of one of America's most popular characters and it delves into the character of the Dark Knight in ways that have not been seen on the silver screen before.<br /><br />We \\"begin\\" with a young Bruce Wayne and get a feel for the wonderful, loving childhood he had until his parents were tragically murdered in front of his own eyes by a bum on the streets of Gotham.  We then follow a grown up Bruce all around the world as he learns what it is like to live without a home or money and as he seeks the means to fighting injustice some time after the death of his parents.  We learn why it is that he chooses to become a man dressed like a giant bat and how he acquires the weapons and technology needed to fight the criminals of Gotham and to restore peace to his beloved city.  Even the functionality of every part of the suit from the cape to the ears on the cowl is explained.  That's just a glimpse of the attention to detail that this movie takes into allowing us to know this character.<br /><br />Also, we really get to know Bruce Wayne in Begins.  He really has such a great character arc and we really feel for the character long before he ever dons the cape and cowl. Bruce Wayne/Batman is clearly the central character in this movie, which the previous live-action films failed to accomplish.<br /><br />The cast in the film is superb.  Christian Bale does an incredible job as Bruce Wayne and Batman.  As many know, these are really two different parts because Bruce Wayne is really the fake, public persona wheras Batman is when Bruce Wayne shows his true identity.  They finally touch on this, and it is done beautifully.  Also, Gary Oldman is wonderful as Lt. Jim Gordon - and thankfully this character is done in such an awesome fashion.  He is Batman's only friend and a great cop on a terribly corrupt police force in this movie, the way the character was meant to be.  Michael Caine really shines as Alfred and the character is portrayed wonderfully.  Liam Neeson is spectacular (as always) as Henri Ducard, Bruce Wayne's mentor.  Cillian Murphy is wonderfully twisted and creepy as the Scarecrow without being over the top whatsoever.  And Morgan Freeman's performance is great (as always) in the few memorable scenes he is in.  Katie Holmes also really gives a great performance as Bruce's lifetime friend and Gotham Assistant DA.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes - it is fantastic.  You are really drawn into this movie for its entirety.  Christopher Nolan and David Goyer wrote a great script with an incredibly touching and suspensful plot.  Nolan also directed flawlessly.  The action scenes are really incredible as well, and all of the action is necessary to the plot and extremely well edited.<br /><br />One of the most wonderful things about this movie is the realism that is consistent throughout the movie.  Gone are the ridiculous neon lights of Schumacher's movies and the extreme Gothic tone of Burton's.  You really feel that Batman could exist in this Gotham City - even so much that this movie doesn't feel like a \\"superhero\\" movie.  It really goes above and beyond the genre to create a very realistic movie that all audiences can thoroughly enjoy and appreciate at the same time.  It may be a little bit on the scary side for younger kids - but there is hardly any objectional content in this movie otherwise (which I greatly appreciate).<br /><br />This movie is a MUST SEE, in my opinion, and a MUST OWN for anyone who likes having great movies to watch any time.  Check this one out.  It is an extremely fine film, and one of my favorites thatI have ever seen.
B0009UC7H0|5.0|This film is one of the best that I've seen Matthew McConaughey do in a long time. A great action adventure that dosen't take itself to seriously. This buddy movie is well cast. I especially loved William H. Macey's portrail of the cigar chomping Admiral Sandecker. A much more convincing performance of this very shrewed character than played by Jason Robards in Raise the Titanic. This film is well worth the watch.

They are fun and right on for these animals (although I don't know what a flamingo fluting sounds like, the rest are familiar).   <br /> <br />This book ALWAYS makes my daughter smile.
B000A88F22|5.0|I have to say, this series caught me by surprise. When I heard Britney Spears was releasing a reality show I thought it was going to be boring, you know, the fake \\"reality\\" of celebrities. I thought it was going to be another \\"Newlyweds\\"...with the rehearsed, obviously written stupid Jessica remarks. Instead, with \\"Chaotic,\\" the public got to see home footage of Hollywood's most talked about couple. I think that is where critics were confused. They thought the show was horrible...because the show was not a \\"show\\"...it was home movies edited into 6 episodes. I mean, how \\"show-worthy\\" are home movies, anyways? <br />I think this DVD is a great item to be owned by any Britney fans and also for all those pop culture vultures out there. The DVD is packed with great extras: music videos, audio cd, deleted scenes. Great stuff. :)
B000075BFK|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM, ALOT OF PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT NAS DOING A SONG WIF TUPAC, WAT DESE DUMB F*CKS DONT NOE IS PAC SQUASHED BEEF WIF HIM BEFORE HE DIED.  REGARDLESS THIS IS AN EXCELLENT TUPAC ALBUM DAT WAS RELEASED. IT HAS SOME REMIXES AND SOME SONGS THAT THE OUTLAWS KILLED. BUT OVERALL THIS ALBUM ONCE AGAIN BRINGS OUT TUPACS PROFITIC FLOW AND LYRICS. FOR EXAMPLE IN CATCHIN FEELINGS WEN TUPAC SAYS- \\"FEELING BLESSED, THE RICHER I GET THE MORE I STRESS, SMOKING LYE, WATHING TIME FLY, WAITING FOR DEATH, DEAR GOD I BEEN FEELING LIKE IM CLOSE TO JESUS, PARONOID NEAR MY PISTOLS CLOSE SMOKING TREES\\"   AND DATS JUST TUPAC GETTING WARMED UP IN DIS ALBUM. SO BELIEVE ME AND GO DO UR SELF A FAVOR AND BUY THIS ALBUM. AND BURN ALL UR 50 CENT ALBUMS.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Let's get this straight, folks: Britney Spears is an entertainer, and a great one at that.  So what if she doesn't have that great of voice anymore?  I think we all know that already.  2003 (and 2004's) best-selling by a female album In the Zone, her fourth studio release, is a combination of dance-heavy beats and futuristic pop muses, but along with all this club-ready hype are the moody ballads that are \\"Shadow\\" and Spears' self-penned (yes, both lyrics AND music) \\"Everytime,\\" one of 2004's best songs.  The Grammy-winning \\"Toxic\\" is, of course, the standout track on Zone, but the aforementioned \\"Everytime\\" could also be considered a close second because of its music box-like piano arpeggios and breathy but delicately beautiful vocals.  Pro-masturbation \\"Touch of My Hand,\\" also co-written by Britney Spears, is one of the most musically expressionistic songs on the CD, as is first single \\"Me Against the Music.\\"  In the Zone is a spectacularly produced, performed and written album, and regardless of who Spears is seen as, here she proves she's definitely all that.
B0009XRZ9W|5.0|The Polar Express will become a holiday classic, alongside the likes of \\"White Christmas\\", \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\", \\"A Christmas Story\\", and \\"T'was the night Before Christmas\\". It is a very moving and exciting tale of adventure from the perspective of a young child, swept up in a wonderful adventure of a magical train journey to the North Pole on Christmas Eve. It is a tale of friendship, awe, and discovery unparallelled in recent cinamatic presentations. I am over sixty years old and, after watching this movie twice, I am still facinated by it.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Isn't it funny how much love and hate one person can generate?  This person happens to be the No. 1 pop star in the world, and her name is Britney Spears.  In 1998 a then-unknown Spears took charge on the Top 40 charts with her Grammy-nominated, international El Numero Uno single \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and has since ruled the roost as the best-selling teen artist of all time.  From first look at her celebrated video to her much-talked about first hit it was more than apparent Britney wasn't trying to be the good girl she tried so hard to say she was; the knotted-up Catholic schoolgirl outfit was basically guaranteed to grab headlines and her suggestive dancing proved a definite attention-getter.  Released in January 1999, ...Baby One More Time the album took the world by storm and Britney became an instant, almost overnight success.  The record continued to churn out hit after hit but as soon as it cooled Spears was ready to hit listeners again with her uber-charming \\"Oops!...I Did It Again.\\"  The album sold 1.3 million copies its first week alone, setting a new record, and Britney continued her reign as teen pop's No. 1.  Oops!...I Did It Again is often seen as the perfect pop confection, although it tends to be too heavily produced, giving Britney's vocals (especially heard in Top 10 favorite \\"Stronger\\") somewhat of the sound like a computer's.  Still, ballads like \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\\" showed off Spears' throaty chops.  Regardless of its lavish overproduction, Oops!...I Did It Again really proved Britney did do it again, and man, did she get it right. <br /> <br />*If you don't like pop music don't listen to it, dissers.
B000000ZGO|4.0|Isaac Hayes is known as \\"Black Moses.\\" I don't know if Hayes could walk on water but he is one smooth soul-brother. \\"Hot Buttered Soul\\" is a very intriguing album. It contains only four songs. The first two funky and faster-paced than the last two. \\"Walk on By\\" is just a great soul song, done by other artists as well, but not done better than the Bar-Kays Hayes excellent backing band. \\"Hyperbolic...\\" if you'll notice contains parts for which served as the inspiration for more than a few future rap songs. What's incredible is how layered and multi-textured the songs are. Their's a lot of guitar, horns, piano and strings on the songs. On \\"By The Time I Get to Phoenix\\" Hayes simply raps for a while about love. You could say it was an album ahead of it's time. Again what's amazing is that a song like Public Enemy's \\"Black Steel in The Hour of Chaos\\" took a twenty second part of a 10 minute song like \\"Hyperbolic...\\" and made a whole song out of it. Hayes was an incredible artist who would reach higher peaks with \\"Shaft\\" but \\"Soul\\" is an overlooked album in pop music history. If you can buy the Ultimate Masterdisc version which will run about $30 because the regular cd's sound is atrocious.
0385338686|3.0|Sophie Kinsella's \\"The Undomestic Goddess,\\" revolved around Samantha Sweeting, a career-minded lawyer at Carter Spink, a top lawyer firm in London. Samantha's life revolved around her work, and she was constantly on the phone as well as emailing. After seven years of working at Carter Spink, she believed that she had a good chance of being made a partner at the firm. Samantha came from a family where career was more important than anything else and she assumed that was how it was supposed to be. However, one day, Samantha noticed a memo written to her by one of the partners, Arnold, to complete a task. She had forgotten about it completely and now her client actually lost 50 million pounds because of her carelessness. Shocked at her own carelessness, Samantha just left the office, took the train and wound up outside of London, in the countryside. Due to some misunderstanding, she had gotten herself a job as a housekeeper for a couple. As she had never done any housework in her life, this soon proved to be a challenging task.  <br /> <br />I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella but I am quite disappointed in \\"The Undomestic Goddess.\\" The plot is too predictable and a bit far-fetched too. It's hard to believe that the character Samantha can be transformed into a housekeeper so easily. In addition, I find that Samantha is too similiar to the character Becky in the Shopaholic series. Other than that, this was still a rather interesting read as the it's fast-paced and the writing is clear and concise. Definitely worth a try!

0670033375|5.0|I read Diamond's new book before reading \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" so I did not know what to expect.  I was thoroughly impressed with Diamond's ability to muster evidence for a simple yet important thesis: that environmental degredation can cause societies to collapse. <br /> <br />One must make clear that he does not argue that ALL societies collapse from environmental degredation (as some reviewers seem to think).  Rather, he is pointing out that the environment can be an important factor in the success or failure of civilizations.  I thought he argued this well, and even went out of his way to avoid ecological determinism.  For example, he takes several countries with similar environments and shows how they diverged based largely on political fortunes. <br /> <br />Likewise, Diamond is careful to avoid the appearance of an anti-corporate bias by comparing different companies and industries and pointing out good environmental practice. <br /> <br />The message at the end of this book is a necessary correction to the misconception that many, including the Bush administration, hold.  Today's leaders must acknowledge that the environment is an important factor in maintaining economic and societal growth.  The question Diamond asks is not whether we are doomed to fail but rather whether we choose to.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have purchased six copies of this item. One for me and five for friends/family. Really great series that got little play. I'm so glad to see they have made the movie.
B000001F3C|5.0|I really enjoyed this album with some great songs as well as great beats. Many of these songs on this album aren't the well known radio sung popular songs (less 2)that we know and usually sing along to. 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' is a hark back to the sounds of an early sound of U2. Many of the older fans and followers of U2 will enjoy this album and the newer fans of U2 should also take from this album a new retrospective of this multi-talented group. Another personal favourite song for me from this album is 'New Year's Day', a ode to the New Years Day and eve. Two well known songs included on this release is 'Drowning Man' a soft song and 'Surrender' a romantic filler for any type of mood.<br /><br />A must for any collector of U2 or a fan looking to add his or her music library with good music.
B00000I14Z|5.0|In 1959, Charles Mingus was at the height of his powers-- in the midst of a roll from a stream of fine music on Atlantic, he signed to Columbia and delivered his first album in early 1959, \\"Mingus Ah Um\\".  Perhaps the best album Mingus ever recorded, Mingus augments his working band (saxaphonists John Handy and Booker Ervin, pianist Horace Parlan, and drummer Dannie Richmond) with reedman Shafi Hadi and either trombonist Willie Dennis or Jimmy Knepper, and produced an album of such startling variety and briliant performance that it demands attention.<br /><br />To this day, when someone curious about Mingus' music asks me for a recommendation, without hesitation, I immediately suggest this album.  From the opener, it all works-- Mingus' racing \\"Better Git It In Your Soul\\" is a gospel shout masked as a jazz piece-- featuring the leader on rambling vocals, a gospel shout theme, a jaw dropping solo by Booker Ervin (under which the rest of the band claps rhythm) and just stunning and sensitive drumwork from Richmond that puts the exclamation mark on the piece-- this really is about half of what Mingus has to offer as a musician.  The other half comes in funereal ballad \\"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\\", second track on the album.  A tribute to departed saxophonist Lester Young, Mingus evokes raw mourning in his sax line, and Handy's solo and Mingus' support of it are nothing short of astonishing (check Mingus' echo of Handy's fluttering for evidence of this).<br /><br />By the time you've finished these two tracks, if it's not working for you, Mingus probably isn't for you, and the rest of the record isn't going to change anything.<br /><br />Mind you, the rest is pretty good too, alternately energetic and explosive (\\"Bird Calls\\") and mellow and beautiful (\\"Self-Portrait in Three Colors\\") with at least one stunning arrangement (\\"Open Letter to Duke\\") and another bonafide classic in \\"Fables of Faubus\\".  Composed about the then-governer of Arkansas and his segregation policies, \\"Fables\\" originally had vocals, but Columbia censored Mingus, fearing the outcome of such a move (check out \\"Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus\\" on Candid for the uncensored version of the piece).  The resulting piece has to rely on horns only for sarcasm and bitter exposition, which it does remarkably well, and it is full of bluesy solos, including a Mingus solo that is as biting as any vocal could be.<br /><br />The reissue features pristine sound-- it certainly could have been recorded yesterday, and three additional tracks that were unearthed in the '70s.  All three (particularly \\"Pedal Point Blues\\") are fine material nad well worth having.  Included in the liner notes are two essays-- the original album notes and a new one, both of which are interesting reads.<br /><br />\\"Mingus Ah Um\\" is one of the classics of Charles Mingus' catalog, and is on the short list of essential jazz listening.

B000001EAQ|5.0|This album was originally released in 1983 to an awaiting newly established fan base. 'Pop' brought together for U2 a newer sound mixed with the introduction of techno anthem beats in a few of their songs. 'Discotheque' is a primary example of the mixing of U2's modern rock meeting anthem techno and the result is a positive song mix sound that is pleasing to the ears. The album has many new songs previously unreleased as well as reworked songs. 'Mofo', is another exploratory song by this band that brought together soft rock beats with a little European grunge flavour. The songs that standout in this beautifully designed album are 'Gone', 'Please' and 'If God Will Send His Angels'.<br /><br />This album release is for any fan of this Irish 4 person band headed by the rock god 'Bono' himself. 'The Edge' on guitars is cutting edge and decent to listen to. Get the CD and add it to your U2 collection, you sure won't be dissapointed.
0671027344|5.0|This is a great book about growing up in high school/early adolescence, told through a series of letters to an anonymous person by our only witness, Charlie.<br /><br />Charlie is a \\"wallflower\\" who observes and attempts to understand everything before him.  He deals with friendship, school, family, depression, all while giving us a front-row, extraordinary view of it all. Although some of the situations seem unlikely (especially for a freshman!), the essence of the book is growing up and the feelings and perspective that comes with it.  Charlie does a wonderful job of analyzing strange things in life, that many people don't even consider because they have grown accustomed to it.<br /><br />I think the main moral of this story is composed of three things:  Looking around once in a while, participating in life, and never giving up.  Charlie forces others to look at things in a new light.  While life is going on, many teens don't stop and look around.  Not only look at things differently, but also, as the book says, \\"participate.\\"  And never give up.  Charlie went through a lot but didn't give up in the end.<br /><br />I recommend this book to any teenager looking for more to life, and every parent raising one.
0446677450|1.0|I don't understand why this book is rated so high and why it is a best-seller. The author continues to urge \\"financial literacy,\\" but the book doesn't make a person financially literate in the slightest. I would be surprised if anyone over the age of 12 learns anything from this book--all the key points are obvious if you have ever managed any of your money in your life.
B0006399FS|5.0|I agree about a lot of things with the previous reviewer, Brendan MacManus, but despite what he said, I still have to give HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB a full five stars.  I think U2 really got it right here with a super strong collection of songs straight from the gut.<br /><br />In my opinion, the strongest songs are:<br /><br />\\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" - one of those gorgeous songs that starts out slow and quiet and then blows up big time like...an A-Bomb.  Huge.<br /><br />\\"City of Blinding Lights\\" - Poppy shouter with poignant undertones.<br /><br />\\"Original of the Species\\" - Thoughtful, warm, beautiful.<br /><br />\\"Yahweh\\" - Rousing rocking anthem.<br /><br />\\"All Because of You\\" - Punky, edgy, funny, optimistic, hopeful, very highly danceable.<br /><br />\\"Miracle Drug\\" - Lovely, thoughtful, painfully honest.<br /><br />\\"Vertigo\\" - Sure, an obvious choice, but one of U2's greatest rockers ever.<br /><br />Weakest cut:<br /><br />\\"Love and Peace or Else\\" - Not bad, necessarily, but not as strong as the rest of the CD.  This techno rock piece sounds like an outtake from POP or a throwaway B-side.<br /><br />For those who give this CD one or two stars, hey, you totally have the right to your opinion, but do you really think that this CD is so bad as to rank it alongside of something like Britney Spears or William Hung?  I think most reasonable people would at least be willing to admit they like a few tracks here.<br /><br />Me, I love it, and think it stands tall alongside of U2's best work.
B000002NJS|5.0|OK...the reviewer who stated that Madonna was \\"copying\\" Mariah Carey must be smoking crack.   For starters how could anyone listen to this album and thinks it sounds like a copy of anything Mariah Carey has done.   To say that Mariah Carey popularized electronica music in itself is ridiculous.  Electronica began in Europe and has evolved into other forms of dance music but Mariah's single \\"Heartbreaker\\" is anything but electronica.  It is r+b/hip-hop not electronica/dance.  Since when is taking a sample of an 80's r+b song and using it in your song considered electronica?  Madonna has never taken credit for starting electronica, it was already around for years before she did it but she certainly helped to popularize it. And for the sake of argument it would've been a little difficult for Madonna to copy Mariah's Heartbreaker since Madonna released this album in March of 1998 and Mariah released Heartbreaker in 1999.   How could Madonna copy something when she released her album a year earlier?   The fact is that \\"Ray of Light\\" is one of Madonna's greatest musical achievements.  The album received some of the best reviews of her career, sold close to 17 million copies worldwide and won several Grammy awards.  Don't get me wrong.  Mariah Carey is a wonderful and talented singer in her own right..but is she an  r+b/hip-hop/soul artist and Madonna is a dance/pop artist.  To compare them both is like comparing Ozzy Osbourne to Ja Rule.  Two totally different artists doing totally different styles of music.  People only want to compare divas like Madonna and Mariah because they are both popular female solo artists.   That is all there is to it.  If you want to take the time to down one artist in order to build up your personal favorite at least have enough intelligence to get your facts straight.  Madonna has done more for dance music than any other artist in American history including Donna Summer.  She has helped take many styles of dance music and take them out of theclubs and popularize them and get them on the radio.  The fact that she has had 34 number #1 dance singles is more than enough proof of her contributions and influence to dance music.  And when \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\" is released in November of 2005, Madonna will again prove why she is the queen of dance music.  Get your facts straight!! <br /> <br />

B00005JM0B|1.0|If you're truly a lover of the first two movies, do yourself a favor and pull a 'Highlander 2'...just pretend it doesn't exist and go about your day happily. <br /> <br />But because sometimes my curiosity overcomes my good sense too, I'll be brief and try not to give much of anything away. The facet that makes this film a truly atrocious follow up is the humongous finger it gives, in a thematic sense, to its predecessors. The first two films in the series shared the same, noble theme...\\"There is no fate but what we make.\\" This not so glorious addition edits that slightly to read...\\"Oh, yeah, we were wrong. There really is a fate you can't escape no matter what you do, so you might as well give up.\\" Huh? <br /> <br />Secondly, the Terminator has been reduced to the robotic equivalent of Lou Costello. Sure, it's dangerous, but mostly it's just the straight man. In the first movie, it was terrifying. Remember when it started wearing the shades to cover the gaping wound in its face after it had just surgically removed the remains of its own eye? Now its a cheap gag with pink plastic shades. Have we really fallen so far? <br /> <br />Despite Arnold's involvement, this movie was apparently put together by people who had no clue what the orignal and its sequel were about. Trust me, when that last Terminator's thumbs up disappeared into the molten metal, the world was saved. It's better that way.

The man has watched his zombie flicks, seen what works and what hasn't worked, and compiled it all into a wonderful volume that smacks of realism all over the place.<br /><br />The biggest danger with this book is that you'll get so caught up with it that you'll want to read parts of it to your friends... and if they don't \\"get it\\" then you're just going to look like a psychotic.
B00005AWMF|5.0|I'm fourteen and I love this CD. My parents love it as well. Sade's voice is soothing to your ears and a remarkable listening experience. <br /> <br />Every song is my favorite because every song is wonderful. <br />Once you hear the chorus you will be singing the song inside your head continually. This CD a great jazzy beat with outstanding vocals. <br /> <br />\\"Pearls\\" tells a remarkable story about a woman in Somalia parched in the hot sun. It makes me think of Sade being the little girl. Maybe it is her! <br /> <br />\\"Smooth Operator\\" is always on the radio and probably the most popular Sade song. There's no reason to wonder why. <br /> <br />The sax in the beginning of \\"Your Love Is King\\" is timeless. You just know that song is coming on and you just cannot wait to hear the rest of the melodic tune. <br /> <br />Each and every song tells a story. <br />Once you learn all the lyrics, you can decipher each song's meaning and learn to appreciate the song more. <br />You realize the time and effort. Sade delivers the song in a unique way. She sounds unlike any other vocalist you have ever heard before. <br /> <br />Again, I am fourteen and I can love this music like any other baby boomer would.  <br />It's just lovely music that is dying to be shared. <br /> <br />In fact, this CD was originally my father's and I took it from him to listen. <br /> <br />Out of all the Sade CDs, The Best Of Sade is ultimately the must have of your collection. <br />I reccommend you start off with TBOS before you buy any other Sade CDs. <br /> <br />It would make a lovely gift for any jazz fan. <br /> <br />You won't regret owning it in your home to entertain folks of all ages. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B0000DJZA5|5.0|<br />Buy this CD. <br /> <br />It is far and away the best version of \\"Let it Be\\" or \\"Get Back\\" (bootleg) available. <br /> <br />As many of you know, in January of 1969 the Beatles gathered to rehearse new material for a live show.  The live show never got off the ground, so the idea evolved into making an album from live performances in the studio and from the rooftop performance.  Glyn Johns', the studio engineer at the time, put together an album called \\"Get Back\\" which was ultimately rejected by the Beatles.  While there are some good performances on the original \\"Get Back\\" album, by and large Johns laced studio chatter and banter in between tired and uninspiring takes of songs.  The dreariest performances are on the first side of the album and include, \\"Dig a Pony\\", \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" and \\"I've Got a Feeling.\\"  In what can only be described as incompetence, negligence or both, Johns chose these tired sounding songs (which were recorded much earlier in the sessions) over much tighter and better performances that were recorded toward the end of the sessions. <br /> <br />After rejecting Johns' \\"Get Back\\" album, the Beatles brought in Phil Spector to have another go at making a record.  Spector, unlike Johns, included the best takes of the songs, including a number of rooftop performances. However, Spector sabotaged and ruined the album by putting gaudy, over the top orchestration on a number of songs.  By going back and forth between solid live sounding performances and gaudy, over produced monstrosities, Phil Spector's \\"Let it Be\\" is a basket case of a record which sounds completely disjointed.  <br /> <br />Which leads us to \\"Let it Be...Naked.\\"  Despite the cheesy title and throw away second disc, LIBN is a great representation of what the album could have been.  Most of the performances on LIBN are by no means totally live.  There is some studio trickery, with different takes being edited together to hide some vocal flubs and wrong notes.  However, this is the best representation of these songs released to date and possibly the closest we will ever come to the raw, live sounding performances the Beatles originally envisioned in January 1969. <br /> <br />A lot has been said about how the Beatles could not get it together for the Get Back/Let it Be sessions.  However, if you hear some of those later January sessions, it becomes clear that while the Beatles may not have been the best of friends, they were turning in musically strong performances of the new songs.  The problem with the music of Let it Be was not with the Beatles themselves, but rather a failure of the original producers to pick the best songs and arrange the album.  Luckily this failure has finally been corrected with the release of \\"Let it Be....Naked.\\" <br />  <br />

0790732254|5.0|One of my favourite movies, which I had been unable to find for some time and finally bought on DVD. Virginia Wolff is an incredibly unpleasant movie about the most frightening married couple anyone will ever see, hopefully, but is acted so artfully that it fully deserves all the Oscars it won. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton spit searing verbal venom at each other from the first frames of the movie, but it only gets hotter from there. A must-see for any fan of either actor, or someone in the mood for a fascinating, dark masterful movie. The extras aren't bad either - eg. this movie initiated the movie rating system because of its adult language and themes, despite only verbal violence and veiled sexuality. If you think a movie needs fancy special effects (or color!) to have an impact or to shock - try this one on for size.

B0000A02TZ|1.0|Beware! They have changed the soundtrack from the original. Why substitute classic tracks which really suited the film for non-descript crappy newer songs? This has been one of my favourite films for many years - so many quotable quotes. But I can't watch the DVD version I bought because the butchered soundtrack annoys me so much. (Those who haven't seen it in original form probably won't have this problem.) There are a few versions for sale so one/some of them may have the original soundtrack - go to Belushi's canteen scene and if they are playing \\"Don't know much about history ...\\" you've got the goods. Otherwise you've been ripped off.
0446678430|5.0|I was looking for a step by step how-to book on getting rich quick.  This is not the book I was looking for.  However, I think the information in this book is invaluable to any investor.   <br /> <br />It's mostly a motivational book, but more importantly it tries to get you to change the way you look at investments, assets, and liabilities.  Kiyosaki really tries to take everything you've ever heard about 'safe' investing and view it from a different perspective.  And I loved what he had to say about 'diversifying' your investments.  Most people think diversifying just means buying mutual funds, or evenly dividing between stocks and bonds.  With that strategy, you are completely at the mercy of the stock market. To Kiyosaki there are three types of investments: real estate, paper assets (stocks/bonds), and businesses.  A good investor should have all three types.   <br /> <br />I must admit that I did not understand much of what he talked about as I am a newbie to investing.  But I think the way that Kiyosaki tries to get people to think 'outside of the box' is an invaluable asset for an investor.  Most importantly though, Kiyosaki tries to convert everyone into being an entrepreneur if they want to be really rich.   <br /> <br />Although I am not sure I want to be an entrepreneur or business owner, I think he is right in saying that that is the quickest way to becoming rich enough to retire early.  I can't get all of my opinions into this one review but I highly recommend the book.  To really benefit from this book you MUST have an open mind.   <br /> <br />If you're too afraid to take risks to retire early, then I recommend David Bach's Finish Rich series.  In fact, if you are a complete newbie to investing, I would start there.  Bach really lays a good foundation for feeling good about your finances and having a strong financial education.  Once you have mastered the basics, Kiyosaki's book could definitely motivate you to retire young and rich.
B000002UDB|5.0|they made a movie from this.it was thier 4th movie.in november of 67,the winter of love[haha],the musical alchemists brought us this one.it had a opener called\\"magical mystery tour\\".it was considered drug related and banned since it said \\"roll up\\".then a beautiful follower with \\"the fool on the hill\\".\\"flying\\" and \\"blue jay way\\" were good.blue jay way was a street in england.then paul took another stab at rejuvenating the old days with \\"your mother should know\\".thats when it kicked in!\\"i am the walrus\\" was up next.john says he wrote this one while playing monopoly while on lsd.if you listen really close at the end you can hear a voice chanting about smoking pot also.then came a #1,since suprisingly there werent any from sgt pepper.it was \\"hello goodbye\\".paul wroye this song for his wife linda about how they werent getting along so well and he wished that they could.then johns early attempt at \\"imagine\\" which crystalized him in his hippie days.it was called \\"strawberry fields forever\\".it was a graveyard in england.this is one of thier best songs ever i think.then another #1 with \\"penny lane\\".then a re-release of \\"baby youre a rich man\\" and the one john played for the largest radio audience of all time-\\"all you need is love[#1}.they even made a less than stellarly reviewed movie,but im sure its not all that bad.i saw it when i was a kid.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I haven't seen the show Wicked yet, bit I am aware that the show is currently playing in Chicago, at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts, Oriental Theatre, my family actually did have tickets to see this show, but we coudln't go the night that we had tickets for, and still haven't see it sinmce, so I don't know when I will see the show, even through I won't see the orginal cast, but it opened here, with the idea to keep it here as long as people liked it, and didn't get tired of it playing here, it actually opened wqith a different cast, that plated until mid June, which then had closed for 10 days, and opened with a Chicago cast. Kristin Chenoweth was apart of the orginal broadway cast, when it opened in New York, at the end of 2003, and they recored this cd and brought it. I bought a copy, but let me warn you that while the is 2 hours and 43 minutes, with a 15 minute intermission, the cd is 71 minutes long, but I also own a copy of Monty Python' Spamalot, and All Shook Up, and both are shorter then 60 mintues, so if you are in a hurry and want to hear the orginal broadway cast, those 2 cds will be better to listen to if you only have an hour to listneing to a broadway show. Stephen Oremus, who later did All Shook Up, that played in Chicago in Previews before oepnning offically in New York, is the Conductor and Director, but I think he is the musical director of the show, but I bet it would have been nice to see the broadway show with the orfinal cast, but it opened in New York, and that would be a far place to see the show. If you can spear 72 minutes of your life, then I urge you to take a listen to this show. But if you are in that much of a hurry then I reccoemend Spmalalot (if you also wanted to hear famous people's voices) or All Shook Up, Spamalot is almost 53 minutes long, and All Shook Up is almost 59 minutes long. But these are some good cds to listen to of the broadway cast, and that would be the orginal cast.    <br />
B000002UB6|5.0|this was released in 1970.it symbolized the death of the hippie era because they od'd right after this album went out or they just butnt out and started making the 1980s[it took them the whole 70s ].they even put out thier 5th movie entitled let it be at this time.its really just them making the album.\\"on our way home\\" was all about great memories and things.it was just like saying we are getting ready to disband.oooohhhhhh,so tragic!then \\"i dig a pony\\".it was different but cool in typical lennon fashion.my 2nd favorite beatle song \\"across the universe\\" was up next.definately drug related.a chick does a version of it at the end of the movie \\"pleasentville\\".\\"i me mine\\" was all about the greedy way people were.\\"dig it\\" was a short little thing in between spaces.then \\"let it be\\" came on.in between hey jude and let it be there were 2 more albums called the white album and abbey road.there were 2 more #1s on abbey road which were \\"something\\" -georges 2nd self done song .it was for his wife patti.in the 70s when she was with eric clapton,he wrote layla and wonderful tonight for her also.the other #1 was \\"come together\\".that was thier 24th #1 song.\\"let it be\\" the song was thier 25th #1.it is abselutely beautiful.he says its for his mom.how sweet!then a dirty little limerick called \\"maggie mae\\".\\"ive got a feeling\\" came up.pearl jam covered that one.even though they normaly suck,pearl jam pulled off this cover.it was a really good song too.then paul digs deep for an old school beatles song and plays \\"one after 909\\".2 more to go!the last 2 songs were thier 26th and 27th #1s.this set a world record for a band having the most #1s of all time.the songs were \\"the long and winding road\\" which is exsquisite and \\"get back\\"-another throwback song.they eventualy got over 1 billion record sales for thier albums.the only band to exceed 1 billion.that makes them the band with more sales than other band or soloist or any other conglomeration in the history of time!that makes them the best!the dream was indeed over!
B000AU9UYM|3.0|Batman has always been a cool character.<br /><br />In the old days he used to carry a gun and had that wondrous utility belt filled with who-knows-what to thwart his enemies. Later through various television takes, he was the 'detective' solving riddles and jokes staged by the appropriate villains. (Followed by an occasional dance here and there.) Nevertheless, it was still pretty cool if not entertaining. Much later in 1986, Frank Miller's take on 'The Dark Knight' was just that 'Dark'. Wonderfully futuristic and fabulously written with that nail biting hard edge that finds it's way into every Miller story (Sin City, 300)<br /><br />There's no denying that Tim Burton's 'Batman'(1989) reflects Miller's 'The Dark Knight Returns' mini series. For one, Keaton played the voice dark and sinister when wearing the mask. The way we heard it in our minds as we read through Miller's masterpiece. Up to that point Batman had only been voiced in cartoons and live television as a problem solver, with an almost 'Sherlock Holmes' quality. Hardly reflecting the gritty 'I'm Batman' line that was so viciously spat in the faces of unsuspecting criminals of both Burton's and now Nolan's 'Batman Begins'<br /><br />CONCEPT GRIPE:<br /><br />So why only three stars for B.B.? Well, lets just say, simply, it had it's good and bad points. I guess I had expectations for a better movie.<br /><br />These things happen.<br /><br />As an obviously more realistic take on the 'Batman' story, for me B.B's flaws start with just that topic. Should the Batman series be so realistic? No one questions this because they automatically think that realism is a plus when dealing with comic book stories.<br /><br />Well, we've all seen that guy dressed as Batman at the comic conventions or during Halloween. It doesn't get any more realistic than that. As he walks by, we can't help but sneer to ourselves, 'he doesn't look like the real Batman'. In retrospect, I think we're sneering because this guy is in a costume that looks its best leering over rainy rooftops in the dark of night....however, this caped crusader is casually walking through the convention with a chili dog in one hand and a diet soda in the other. I guess my point is that realism doesn't always work for every character. I feel that Batman works best in comics and animation and if you're doing a take on him for live action, it should have those elements noticeably involved.<br /><br />Batman Begins does have it's 'comic book' moments, but over all (and according to the praise of most critics) I think they were really trying to impress us with the 'realistic' approach. Unfortunately, at times, when Bale took the screen in costume, I couldn't help thinking about that guy at the convention with the chili dog...<br /><br />MOVIE: GRIPES AND CHEERS IN BRIEF<br /><br />GOOD: The film answers (in it's own way) lots of 'why' questions about the Bruce to Batman faze.<br /><br />BAD: Bruce Wayne trains with ninjas for months or years or whatever and doesn't realize their philosophy about killing.<br /><br />BAD: Fight scenes are too dark and too fast. Pull back for a sec...<br /><br />GOOD: Oldman's take on Gordon is one piece of realism that grounds the movie. His acting is surprisingly subtle.<br /><br />BAD: Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow is fine and all, but I'd rather have had a villan that didn't need to take his mask on and off when on screen.<br /><br />GOOD: Michael Cain's Alfred is well played and written.<br /><br />BAD: Katie Holmes: a threat to the Mob? Really?<br /><br />BAD: The Bat Tank made it's appearance too soon. Save it for Frank Miller's futuristic take on an aging Bruce Wayne in 'The Dark Knight Returns'.<br /><br />GOOD: Bruce Wayne's playboy antics involving wet women and buying a Hotel. Nice.<br /><br />BAD: B.B's climatic ending is a bit cliche involving former masters and train crashes. I would expect more fight out of the man who trained Batman.<br />Should have let him escape.<br /><br />BAD: The relationship between Christian and Katie. I wasn't buyin' it.<br /><br />BAD: No strong 'bad guy' presence even though the story had plenty of them in it. Nolan's film is primarily viewed through Batman's eyes and focuses on his origins. As this is the case, I felt that the Scarecrow, the mob involvement and the former master story lines detracted us from getting to know and loath one good villain.<br /><br />BAD: Bale's Batman voice: too raspy!<br /><br />DVD:<br /><br />Looks like a tight 'Deluxe Edition' and will probably pick it up as a present for my wife. I think she wants us to get it so she can drool over Bale and Murphy...mostly Murphy;)<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHTS:<br /><br />Burton's take on Batman (which comes out on special edition DVD on 10/18 along with the rest of the previous live action films) was a breath of fresh air for the franchise. Unfortunately he 'weirded' folks out a bit with his typical Burton antics in the sequel. Shumacher's versions, noticeably boring after you get past the bright colors, didn't fare much better. (Although I thought Jim Carey was a perfect Riddler)<br /><br />Nolan's should have left them all in the dust, and in my opinion didn't. He just toned down the colors and added another flawed movie to the series. Hope the next one plays better the way Spider Man 2 did for that series.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I really enjoyed 'Batman: The Animated Series' and it's subsequent full length releases the most. Dark and full of retro 40's charm. A nice mix of the 'brooding Batman' from Miller's 'Dark Night' and a respectful dose of the ,detective Batman' from creator Bob Kane - And lets face it, Kane is the only man who truly knows who Batman really is.s film is primarily viewed through Batman's eyes and focuses on his origins.

0060989157|5.0|I don't care for Motely Crue's music, never have.  I considered myself to be too intellectual and well breed for their low IQ/high RMP method to take them to the highest of highs and the lowest of lows.  But this is one absolute, insanely good time.  You will roar with laughter, turn away in disgust, gasp in horror, and shake your head.  How could these four have lived the lives they have?  Because they could.    Want to know little tidbits about other bands from that same era who looked and sounded similar?  Want to know how many women Vince Neil slept with before he put on all that weight?  Want to hear all about Mick Mars and his crippling bone disease, Nikki Sixx and his overdose, Tommy's marriages and tabloid terrors?  It's all here!  One doesn't have to guess with other rock biographies if what they are telling you is really true when they are telling their anecdotes, because no one in their right mind would make this up!  Probably because this was written by men, when most rock biographies are women telling tales about who and how many they slept with, leaving that double standard gap of \\"Gee whiz, is this true?\\".  They were the ones who invited debautchery in.     This is not a great literary work, and if you consider yourself smarter than them (which believe me, is not hard to achieve), don't let anyone catch you reading it.  Their goal was to write a page turner, entertain, and turn a profit.  So have fun with it right along with them.    Older and wiser?  Maybe.  Now that 20 years have passed and nostalgia has set in, they're enjoying a sort of second chance.  Wonder what their children will say or do to rebel against them?  Maybe they should become strait A students in the math club.  But hey, as far as rock and roll excess goes, it literally doesn't get much better than this.

0767827716|5.0|Poor Artie Cunningham.  He's a geek.  His parents are very controlling.  He can't come close to talking to girls.  Heck, he can't even get his locker to open.  Fortunatly for him, he is best friends with the most popular jock in school, Dennis and has a solid friendship with him.  Dennis has his back when the school bullies pick a fight early in the film and Dennis gets the best of them.    On the way home that day, Artie forces Dennis to stop off at some old man's shack to look at the car he wants to buy.  A beat up 1957 Plymouth.  Artie just can't resist and cuts a check on the spot for the junker, despite Dennis' pleas against it.  The car's name---Christine.  As the old man tells us \\"when my brother brought her home in '57, it had the best smell.  That new car smell.  No smell in the world is better than that.  'Cept pu**y.\\"    Anyway, Artie forms an unnatural bond with this car as he is toiling for weeks trying to restore it to original condition.  Oddly enough, as he is doing so, his attitude shifts.  He is confident.  He is cocky.  He manages to woe and take out the new girl in school, who also happens to be the prettiest.  Things are going great for Artie.  Until...    The bullies from the beginning take their vengeance out on Christine and total the car, complete with take a dump on the dashboard.  Artie does not get mad...Christine gets even.    Suddenly, the bullies are being followed and hunted down by this car.  One by one, they meet their end, until none are left.  The police are naturally following Artie, but we can never quite tell if he is even in the Christine when this is all happening.  How can Christine be stopped??  Dennis has a plan.    \\"Christine\\" is one of those rare occasions where the movie that was based on the book is actually as good as the book.  The story, written by Stephen King, is very familiar of King's earlier writing, in the sense that it has to do with an inanimate object, taking possesive powers over a human.  Very much like \\"The Shining\\", only on wheels.  John Carpenter does a fabulous job as director of this film and gives Christine the same slasher quality you would think of when watching Michael Myers in \\"Halloween\\".    The special effects are really cool for the time, especially when we see Christine repair her own damages and the soundtrack in this movie is excellent.    This is a classic horror movie and definetly a must for ANY fan of STephen King's or John Carpenter's.  And, if you are a fan of this film, may I also suggest Stephen King's \\"Maximum Overdrive\\"    Enjoy!
B000002UAC|5.0|direct from 11-22-63,its the beatles 3rd album called \\"with the beatles\\".between this and please please me was one entitled simply\\"beatles 2nd album\\".they pick up the pace from thier last albums here with the 1st song\\"it wont be long\\".then back to the lovey dovey stuff with \\"all ive got to do\\".its about the helplessness one feels in love.then another #1!\\"all my loving\\" was up next.its one of the best songs from thier pre-revolver days.\\"dont bother me\\" slows down the pace a little.its about a pesky chick,probably some obsessed groupie.\\"little child\\" was about a young chick again.man,they had a thing for teen girls!\\"please mr postman\\" was next.some chicks did it 1st.another i mss you song.then it was \\"roll over beethoven\\".it wasnt that nice but people thought it was cool.beethoven was the last musical genius before lennon and mccartney came around.more songs about love with \\"hold me tight\\".its good.then its \\"youve really got a hold on me\\".this song reached so many people they even sung it on the show \\"roseanne\\".thats a long strange trip there!its one of the best songs of thier early career.\\"i wanna be your man\\" is a bit faster and made all the young chicks crazy.they should bottle that magnetism up and sell it.\\"devil in her heart\\" is about a chick with evil intentions.i think satan thrives in every female heart.more love stuff comes along with \\"not a 2nd time\\".about re-experiencing heartbreak after you swore youd never let it happen to you again.then track #14 all about \\"money\\".they were raking it in by the bulldozer full after this  one was released.they were still flying high off the awesome momentum from the other 2 albums and still picking up speed!this is a classic album that helped shape music back in the day before they hopped a boat to america.where they were already the #1 thing in the world!
B0006L16N8|5.0|I became a Coldplay fan when \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" was first released and I was not sure Coldplay could top or equal that masterpiece.  However, \\"X&Y\\" not only equals their previous album but stands out as a masterpiece in its on right.  \\"X&Y\\" is an album that anyone can appreciate because the album itself is about emotions, in particular love.  However, this album is also the deepest album Coldplay has put out in the music world yet.  The album is split in the track listing on the case for good reason...the first section represents \\"X\\" and the last represents \\"Y\\".  \\"X\\" are songs that are dedicated and meant to be sung to the \\"XX\\" gender (aka female gender) and seem to embody the elements of feminity.  The last section, \\"Y\\", are songs that are the pourings out of the male heart to a female and embody masculine emotions even more so.  As such, that tone is shown in the tracks and where they appear on the album was definitely planned out perfectly.    \\"Square One\\" opens up the album and the \\"X\\" section of the record with a very dreamy opening and then a strong chorus section filled with strong guitars and drumming.  It is a song that asks for someone to listen to a person and that it doesn't matter who it is...it's also about a person who is trying to break free into becoming who they are supposed to be.  It is filled with emotions that a woman feels when she is going through changes in her life and this song seems to have this on the underside of the lyrics.  \\"What If\\" has been called the new \\"The Scientist\\".  However, \\"What If\\" is more of expression of what if things didn't happen as they should, what if you couldn't be with that person you thought you were meant to be with forever.  If anything, this has an undercurrent of the feelings of fear that a female might feel when she is in a relationship and trying to see if it's meant to be forever.  \\"White Shadows\\" is about those things that haunt everyone and make us think about what we want in our lives.  \\"FixYou\\" is a song about loss, about comforting someone who has experienced loss...if anything it is a song dedicated to female and helps her realize that she is understood in the time of loss.  It seems simple but it is also a very tender song.  \\"Talk\\", something key to relationships, and something that females do quite often to work out things...Coldplay seems to build upon that and makes it a plea to talk to someone and communicate about what is going on in life.  \\"X & Y\\" may end off the X section but it is the unity of X and Y, male and female.  The lyrics in \\"X & Y\\" are absolutely beautiful and amazing...this is a song celebrating the marriage of man and woman, speaking of being \\"best friend\\" and of floating and drifting together as one throughout time.    \\"Speed of Sound\\" opens the Y section of the record, one that seems to identify more with the masculine set of emotions and how they are expressed in conveying love and other things.  Though the similarities between \\"Clocks\\" and \\"Speed of Sound\\" are inevitable, \\"Speed of Sound\\" is the answer song to \\"What If\\"...it is a song of encouragement and one that paints what beauty is ahead in a relationship.  \\"A Message\\" is the male answer to \\"Fix You\\"...it is the observation of the female suffering and the male offering himself to help fix the female and give her comfort.  \\"Low\\" is of course about love but it's also a song about looking for love beyond what may be seen or unseen...this song is the compliment to \\"White Shadows\\" and is a song that encourages to look for those things that are more than just black and white.  \\"The Hardest Part\\" is an admittance of pain of letting go and being broken...it is about communication, about talking through things and serves as the answer to \\"Talk.\\"  \\"Swallowed by the Sea\\" is a song about togetherness, being in unity in a relationship forever...the answer and compliment to \\"X & Y\\".  \\"Twisted Logic\\" ends the Y section and also the album but brings the album full circle.  \\"Twisted Logic\\" serves to tell how important love is, how amazing it is, how it changes and twists everything but is so logical at the same time.  Where the album started at \\"Square One,\\" symbolizing the beginning of a journey, \\"Twisted Logic\\" is the ending of the journey, the fulfillment of the journey and the only perfect logical ending, twisted as it may seem.    The bonus track, \\"Kingdom Come,\\" was written to be sung with Johnny Cash but has now been recorded without him but is done as a dedication for Johnny Cash.  It is obvious that Mr. Cash was at the end of his life but he was just waiting for the end to come and prepared for what it had in store.  This dedication is very heartfelt and so very appropriate.  It is also a great way to end the album because Johnny Cash's life ended shortly after that of his wife, their love a story for the ages to know and to wish for always, years of commitment and love.    \\"X & Y\\" is quite possibly one of the most perfect albums made because of its symmetry in how the songs flow and also in the lyrical quality.  \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" made Coldplay popular and stands as one of the best albums of the 21st century; however, \\"X & Y\\" is quite possibly one of the top 5 records that will have been recorded in the first decade of the new millennium.
B000002UAI|5.0|it kicked off in the end of 64 with \\"no reply\\" by john about a chick who wont return his phone calls.if thats not sad enough,he topped it with an even sadder one called \\"im a loser\\".very self depreciating!then yet another sad one called \\"babys in black\\".its a great one like all the rest.this was shaping up to be the saddest beatle album to date.[then].so they tossed in \\"rock and roll music\\".it sent people crazy with beatlemania!even young einstien did a cover all the way in the 80s.\\"ill follow the sun\\" is all about clinging to hope when all seems dark.they probably did that one to get out of the deppressive theme but it just comes off pretty and sad as opposed to inspirational in a better mood kind of way.it,along with the other beatle songs, inspired like every intelligent being whoever created music from then on out.\\"mr moonlight\\" is about staring at the moon while all shot up on love\\".its kind of dreaery too.\\"kansas city\\" made my top 1000 songs i know and like in at #999.its good since i had to like them and all.my second least favorite beatle song.then the #1 youve all been waiting for..........\\"8 days a week\\".paul says hes got so much love for some chick that even if there were 8 days in a week,it wouldnt be sufficient to get it all out.then \\"words of love\\" which is happier than the rest.\\"every little thing\\" about how one in love becomes very fascinated by every minute detail of thier love interest.its alright.then they threw in another sad one called \\"i dont want to spoil the party\\" where hes bumming at a party and wants to leave so as not to drag everyone else down with him.then theres \\"what youre doing\\" to end it on a happy note.the darkest beatle album at that time but as with all beatle albums it is abselutely sensational.
B00005JNSK|5.0|Warning: If you don't want spoiled, STAY AWAY!<br /><br />Thank you :-D.<br /><br />OMG, You have GOT to see this movie!!!<br /><br />Johnny Depp's odd take on Wonka has him with pale skin, antisocial/kid-like behavior, weird haircut... he's creepy, but unlike Gene Wilder's portayal *no offense to fans of his* it doesn't want to make me hurl or run for cover.<br /><br />And well let's face it, if you were cooped up in a chocolate factory and out of touch with you family and the outside world PLUS if you were picked on as a kid *as I suspect Mr. Wonka probly was) you WOULD be a tad offbeat.<br /><br />I don't really see how Depp! Wonka looks like Michael Jackson, aside from the pael complexion. And people comparing when he invited JUST Charlie to the factory in the movie to MJ's molestation trial... NOBODY PLANNED THAT WHEN THEY WROTE THE SCRIPT SO DROP IT!!!! *deep breath* Okay then...<br /><br />This adaptation is much more faithful to Roald Dahl's characters then the original. Not as many liberties were taken with the plot. *With the exception of some flashback's of Wonka dentist dad/childhood... nice touch I thought :), gives Willy and his behavior a bit more depth* Plus with all the new technology (and a bigger budget didn't hurt), they were able to make things seem a bit more real for Wonka's marvelous world (not to mention no orange faced-green haired oompa loompas).<br /><br />OMG the music!!! Danny Elfman did a spectacular job with the arrangements! These songs stay in your heard long after the movie is over *a good thing* The Oompa Loompas songs about the four brats are exceptionally well-done and they used Dahl's own words (in the original they probly cut some to save time I imagine and to get the point faster)... my favorites of those were the 'Mike Teavee' and 'Violet Beaureguarde (sp?)' tracks.<br /><br />The cast... their acting was so wonderful. Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor did a great job Charlie's Mum and Dad, Freddie Highmore was perfect for the role of Charlie.. nice, quiet, and looked poor unlike the last boy who played him (again no offense to fans of the original cast). Everyone had great chemistry and put so much heart into their roles.<br /><br />They updated a couple things, Mike being obsessed with Video games instead of just TV programs and Violet/Her Mother being very competitive but it fit the story.<br /><br />Only complaint I had at the end was that Augustus wasn't skinny after going up the pipe, still his fat self.. but only a minor nitpick in such an amazing movie.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie enough (seen it 5 times already :-D)... definitely a must-see, totally worth your time. I betcha this will sell out VERY quickly once it's released on DVD (hopefully before Black Friday). Johnny's take on Willy is so delicious! You wanna hug this poor guy and take him home lol.<br /><br />If they decide to film 'Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator', I hope: Johnny and everyone comes back for it and John August does the screenplay again *MAGNIFICENT JOB* Tim Burton already said he wouldn't direct the sequel so I hope it's put in capable hands. Though, when/if they decide to do this movie, it probly won't be for a few years (as Johnny's got a few other projects lined up lol, didn't check on the rest yet).<br /><br />Well, what are you waiting for?! Go see it! *waves bye*<br /><br />Aurora<br /><br />P.S. Yes I know I'm 'pathetic' *rolls eyes* Does it look like I care? *raises eyebrows* :-P.<br /><br />ignore any typos please lolHighmore was perfect for the role of Charlie.. nice, quiet, and looked poor unlike the last boy who played him (again no offense to fans of the original cast).

B000002UAO|5.0|this album came out at the end of 65.it was a change for the beatles as it was thier 1st album where they were all done up on mary jane.they 1st cashed in on a popular theme at the time which was songs about cars with \\"drive my car\\".billy ocean said it inspired him to do \\"get out of my dreams,get into my car\\".both are good songs.then came \\"norwegian wood\\" where george first breaks out the sitar.he loved it ever since thier recent trip to india and introduction to lsd.the song is very pretty and one of my favorites.theres a version of it on the later beatle album \\"anthology\\" where its totaly done up on strings.also beautiful.\\"you wont see me\\" is about break ups.another all time classic rolled in with \\"nowhere man\\".its another one of my all time favorites.\\"think for yourself\\" was good.\\"word\\" too.then paul used foriegn languages in a song.yet another innovation into rock music.he sings french on \\"michelle\\".for those of you who have heard it,belle=girl and the french part is \\"these are words that go together well\\".they had done 2 songs completely in german previously which were german versions to i want to hold your hand and she loves you.but never a french and english mix in a beautiful love song.then there was \\"what goes on\\" and \\"girl\\".2 more love songs.\\"girl\\" was pretty popular.it has huge sighs in it as john suffers with love.\\"im looking through you\\" is all about getting past one chick and onto new ones.then yet another of the all time songs everybody should hear with \\"in my life\\".this song was one of ozzy osbournes top 5 favorite songs of all time.so was \\"yesterday\\".i even heard that ozzy and many other musicians sent paul a letter requesting he do the song in its original form which was \\"scrambled eggs oh how i love your legs\\".ozzy did an awesome version of \\"in my life\\" on his prince of darkness box set.then there was \\"wait\\",\\"if i needed someone\\" and \\"run for your life\\" to wrap it up.this album took the whole music world from where it was to where it was headed.

0060751967|4.0|How did this author come up with such a fun-filled and original plot? A one-fanged vampire? Hilarious. Roman Draganesti is a rich and handsome and very eligible vampire, but he may lose his appeal and the respect of the vampire community if doesn't get his fang fixed. And it must be done before sundown or he'll end up spending all eternity doing some one-sided chomping. What he needs is a twenty-four hour dentist. <br /> <br />Shanna Whelan is a dentist with an adversion to blood, thus her dental practice is going nowhere. Making matters worse, she witnesses a mob hit and now they're after her. <br /> <br />The Vampire saves her and expects her to save his fang. There's all kinds of sexual tension, but she's in a quandry. If she fixes his fang, will he bite her?  <br /> <br /> <br />How To Marry A Millionair Vampire is crazy funny and I highly recommend it for those who enjoy unrealistic but cleverly worded vampire novels.

B000000WJZ|5.0|Forget the \\"alternative\\" tag the media saddled this band with. This is a Rock album, through and through. But it's not the dumbed-down \\"rawk and rooolll\\" of the seventies ( thinking of Nugent, Meatloaf etc ) or the dreadful hair metal / glam rock rip off of the Eighties ( Poison, Ratt, et al). Even though they take inspiration from many sources, like prog rock, heavy riff rock, punk rock and new wave, the Smashing Pumpkins were at their root just a great rock band, and I think this is their best album. One I can put on and not have to worry about skipping anything, or programming my cd player. One great tune after another. Many different moods. Some songs are trippy, reminding me of early period Pink Floyd, some songs remind me of Led Zeppelin, with super heavy guitar riffs. But the songwriting is pure Billy Corgan, one of the best writers of my generation. Pure songwriting genius, no doubt about it. Kudos must also go to producer Butch Vig, who got incredible vocal and instrumental performances out of this band ( although I am told Billy did most of the bass and guitar work himself, and his bandmates played the live shows - this type of autonomy can be seen as some as ego, I see it more as quality control, even though it ultimately tore this band apart.) This is without a doubt one of  the best - if not THE BEST  - rock albums of the last 25 years. The best place for casual or curious fans to start. The follow up to Siamese Dream, the double disc Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, is a bit much to digest in one sitting, although it contains some great songs as well, and is slightly more varied in approach.
0393317552|2.0|Interesting except his explanations were just a little too pat.  That and numerous special pleading made me wonder whether or not his theories are valid.  I'm not an expert in the fields I'd need to be to judge his claims.  I think I'll add \\"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor\\" to my reading list to get another point of view.  Another problem I had with the book is the author repeats himself over and over as if the reader were too stupid to remember what he said in a previous chapter.
B00006X06U|5.0|I was cleaning up my office, and found a radio sampler of this album that had fallen to the bottom of the pile of detritus, and I immediately loaded the sampler onto my I Pod.  <br /> <br />I have been listening to it nonstop ever since. I've always \\"appreciated\\" Joni Mitchell, though I've never been a rabid fan. <br /> <br />That ended when I heard these treatments of her songs. Her voice, a little ragged, but with so much emotion and wisdom. The orchestrations, striking and sometimes strange, but so comforting.  <br /> <br />Travelogue is wonderful record with so many musical and emotional facets. I hear something new and thrilling with each listen.
B0006L16N8|2.0|Read my subject, that basically says it all.  I gave 5-star reviews to \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" because those were truly great albums.  Parachutes was a breath of fresh air in the music scene of 2000, which was dominated by boy-bands and no-talent singers.  Same with A Rush Of Blood To The Head.  But this album is just lame and I think I have plenty of credibility to say that.  I became a fan of them with the Brothers and Sisters EP and got Parachutes soon after.  I also saw them live on the Rush Of Blood To The Head tour the first time they came to my city.  In essence, I'm not one of those people who heard \\"Clocks\\" on the radio and downloaded a couple songs of theirs and called myself a fan. <br /> <br />Anyways, in comparison with Parachutes and A Rush Of Blood To The Head, this album doesn't even hold a candle to those.  Both of those albums sounded intimate while this one sounds way overproduced and it just didn't hit me like the other two did.  Also, there's way too much synth and too many overdubs here, it doesn't have the same rawness as the other two.  Moreover, the lyrics are so incredibly general and inane and Fix You is a prime example.  All of the songs seem to sound the same, which was not the case on their two previous albums. <br /> <br />However, I am not surprised that this album is as bad as it is, because reportedly, they had a poster of U2 in the studio to show them what to shoot for, and U2 today is definitely not something to shoot for, since they also have stopped making good music. <br /> <br />Don't even compare them to Radiohead or The Verve or any other Brit-rock bands because they don't even deserve to be compared to bands whose musical quality didn't drop off after two albums.

B0001MDP3G|3.0|This civil war epic stars Ashton Kutcher as a Confederate guy getting ready to go off to war and short of taking off, meets Pamela Sue Anderson and in about 15 minutes, they fall in love and then he's off to fight the Federales.    She remains behind and apparently isn't bright enough to even feed herself (art imitates life, eh?). Gillian Anderson shows up and serves as some kind of pseudo-hired hand type and helps her take care of bidness on the farm. That is somewhat cool since they are both sisters in real life...    After they get the farm thing going and manage to fend off the Home Guard, Anderson x 2 encounters some type of alien lifeform in a swamp and they manange to escape with the help of David Duchovny. Duchovny plays a Federal soldier who absconds from the solidering ranks and is trying to find his way back from the war to start a leather tanning business.    Along the way, Duchovny and Kutcher find themselves on the same train. They end up skipping out before the movie ends and heading to Seattle for a Nirvana reunion. The remainder of the movie is Anderson x 2 planting corn and chasing some goats. That's about it for this movie...Not too bad to watch if you like civil war alien flicks and alot of glamour shots...

B00000JPH6|5.0|This is a grreat movie from Steven Spielberg. I grew up watching this movie along with many other odd ones like this. It is exactly how I remember it. The characters and costumes are so elaborate. This movie isn't a cheery sign along o no it is much different than what you would expect. It is an adventure for a young boy, who ends up doing the unthinkable. If you love the unreal and unimaginable than you will love this movie too.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|Eagles Farewell 1 Tour <br /> <br />Five Stars Overall <br /> <br />This is a great live concert that features exactly what you would want from the Eagles plus several songs from the solo careers of Don Henley and Joe Walsh.  The delivery was very polished and perfectly executed.  You can sure tell these guys practice, practice, practice, as every song is just nailed by the artists on both the vocals and the instruments.      <br /> <br />The Eagles are all older now and don't try to dance around on stage which is probably a good thing.  The music speaks for itself.  <br /> <br />It was fun to see the different guitars used on each song.   The lead guitarists had a different guitar on almost every song.  Glenn and Don tended to stay within a few select models.  Don is on the drums quite a bit too.     <br /> <br />The audience just loved this show and that is always fun to watch too.  There are plenty of extra players to make it even more interesting.       <br /> <br />I feel like I was there and I didn't even have to wait in line. <br /> <br />At thirty songs and three hours worth of great sounding music and good looking video, this DVD really is value for the money. <br /> <br />

B00005QG9J|4.0|While unable to attain the great symbiosis of Anger, Drama and Musicianship of the Alt-Rock Kings, the Smashing Pumpkins, Incubus displays clearly on Morning View something the Pumpkins and most of their genre counterparts did not possess- a level of maturity.  While the Pumpkins use outbursts of anger (Bullet With Butterfly Wings) to sharply contrast their drama (1979), Incubus takes a more resigned, ebb-and-flow approach to their music.  Though the anger is still visisble (tracks like Nice to Know You, Blood on the Ground) and the drama is still there (Wish You Were Here, 11am, Mexico), the anger has been dull and the drama is mellow, giving the listener a feeling of control to replace part of the power void.  But, controlled maturity will never be as musically satisfying as raw, unbridled adolescent agression
0060555661|5.0|Great book, it is insightful and filled of wisdom. Certainly a must read for those who want to develop a business-like mind. Main premise of the book is how to set parameters in order to chose value, above all, when investing.
6305014140|1.0|I have two issues with this release:<br /><br />1. Although I've never seen the series, the movie appears to have attempted to take the whole series and mash it into a feature-length film. The result is that random villains appear out of nowhere and the movie merely skips from one gory fight scene to the next, without attempting to give us even an inkling of character development or emotional depth.<br /><br />2. This movie is violent as all get out, and that's fine, so were flicks like Vampire Hunter D: Blood Lust and Sin City, and they were still able to tell a compelling, engaging and original story. I instead take more umbrage with the twisted sexual relations in the movie and the wanton and limb-lopping slaughter of characters we never got to know to begin with.<br /><br />All told, this flick left me shaking my head. Unless you go in for the ultraviolent, don't believe the hype.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|This movie has the action, the suspense, the brain tease, without the gratuitous violence that most action flicks must have today.  Absolutely fantastic!!!
B00006JJ51|5.0|NWA is without a doubt the most important rap group ever! Without them who knows how the rap game would be. These guys where the first to actually express their opinions on how f**cked up racism, gang violence, police brutality, and poverty was and still is, and they couldn't of said it better. Grandmaster Flash was the first to really say it in The Message, and I respect that, but without NWA the message may never of gotten through to America. Anyways, this album is f**king awesome. The best songs on here are F*ck Tha Police, Express Yourself, Gangsta Gangsta, A B*tch Is A B*tch, and possibly the best gangsta rap song of all time Straight Outta Compton. I know that song word for word. But all of these songs are great and couldnt of been said better lyrically. All of these guys Eazy E, Ice Cube, MC Ren, Dr Dre, have spectacular delivery. The way they would rhyme is just mesmerizing. Like I said, it couldnt of been done any better, not one weak song on the whole album. Youve got to salute NWA for being real and sending a message to America.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the best written programs ever made for television.  Once again, network execs refuse to see the gold in their midst.  The series is a blend of old west meets final frontier with characters that are real, and believable.<br /><br />The series contains 4 disks with all episodes made of the series including the original pilot and three episodes that never aired. Programs are in widescreen format and overall good quality disks.  The sound is crisp and clear, and the video is very good overall though there are some problems with blacks getting grainy.<br /><br />If you didnt find the serie when it was airing, and lets face it they did make it easy to find, don't miss your chance with the DVD's.
0385510454|3.0|In John Grisham's latest novel, he uses his magnificent storytelling ability to craft another good book.  While not as good as his earlier writings such as 'The Firm', 'The Chamber', 'A Time to Kill', and 'The Partner', it is much better than his previous two legal thrillers, 'The Last Juror' and 'The King of Torts', which felt more like documentaries than novels.  If you are a true John Grisham fan, then 'The Broker' will not let you down.
0446310786|5.0|Like many great work of literature, this one packs a lot into its opening passages. It begins, \\"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow.... When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident.\\" Right off the bat we are made aware that we are about to read of  past events monumental enough to make the participants dwell on them decades later. There is the suggestion that there's more than meets the eye in what's about to unfold, so you'd better pay attention. And, there's the hint of violence in the mentioning of the broken arm. Was it really an accident? We'll have to read to find out.    Often it is said that TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is told through the eyes of a child. This is not strictly true. The narrator of the novel is the now-grown daughter of Atticus Finch, nicknamed \\"Scout\\" in her youth, recalling events from her childhood, albeit in extended passages evoking the point of view of her childhood. This seemingly simple device is a sophisticated one that allows the author a lot of freedom and power to tell the story. The younger Scout's disarming innocence serves as a vehicle for a more direct description of people and events -- after all, a child sees and hears well enough, but she doesn't understand -- allowing Lee to show rather than merely tell about people and events. And, when it suits the author, the adult Scout can address the reader more directly. This slight of hand with the point of view is, I believe, instrumental in creating a novel where the characters seem to come to life and leap off the pages. It's always a delight when writing so technically well-thought-out remains so easy to read. Small wonder that adults should love the book so much and urge middle school students to read it. It is an approachable masterpiece.    Some readers may complain that the novel takes its time getting around to what is considered its pivotal element, the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman. I cannot see how Lee could have possibly told her story otherwise. We start with the children, who make up their own games and stories and more or less invent their own world as much as possible. Then the adult world gradually intrudes on Scout, her brother Jem, and their peculiar friend Dill Harris. Without being immersed in the children's Eden first, we cannot really understand the point of view of the narrator, who is telling the tale of her loss of innocence.  Much is made of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD as an indictment of racism. Certainly an awareness of and sensitivity to racial injustice informs the novel throughout, but I think it is really a tale of paradise lost, which happens to be told in the setting of racial conflict. This is the source I think of the novel's melancholy universality, for regardless whether you grew up in Alabama or in Zimbabwe, there comes a time in your life when you realize that the world isn't a very nice place, but there are still some things worth fighting for, and it's often surprising and inspiring just who the real heroes turn out to be.
B0007P3582|5.0|Dont be misguided by the low stars, because 95% of the people who who put 2 stars or lower are just 50 Cent haters and havent heard the whole cd. Actually this album is great. All of the songs will grow on you. The beats are extremely hot like usual and 50's flow is much better then some people claim. Other than the singles some other songs I like are Im Supposed To Die Tonight, Get In My Car, I Dont Need Em, God Gave Me Style, Ryder Music, but I hate to leave the others out because they all are great. So for all the people who think 50 is ruining rap or whatever, they need to stop talking sh*t and just listen to the music, because the music, like it or not, is SPECTACULAR!!!

1591391105|5.0|This is one of the first books for business that I could actually use many of the charts and points immediately in my new job.  I led a group discussion on the book and all agreed it was useful and gave us all a common vocabulary for starting new jobs in a Company that moves people often. <br /> <br />Really helpful in getting up to speed and producing quickly!
B00008A7QK|5.0|Este album se encuentra entre uno de los mejores en la epoca del Rock and Roll.<br /><br />Marc Bolan,poeta musical que demuestra su poderio como guitarrista y cantante a la vez,en canciones como \\"Mambo Sun\\" \\"jeepster\\" y el clasico que lo puso en el pedestal como uno de los mejores.es \\"Bang a gong\\"(get it on) con la ayuda del gran percusionista y vocal,Micky Finn,se podrian identificar mejor como los dos grandes \\"TIRANOSAURIOS\\" de esa etapa.<br /><br />Un gran Album en verdad!
0783225210|3.0|It's easy to write-off \\"1941\\" as a horrible failure among the jewels of Spielberg's early big stuff (\\"Jaws\\", \\"Close Encounters\\", \\"E.T.\\" & \\"Raiders\\"), which is why you're better off forgetting it's pedigree when tooling it up - and you should watch this flick. <br /> <br />THE PLOT: to the extent that there is one, \\"1941\\" tells the story of frantic Californians in the manic Christmas following the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Beginning with a scene that parodies the skinny-dipping victim in \\"Jaws\\", \\"1941\\" boasts John Belushi as \\"Wild Bill\\" Kelso, a fighter pilot who can't read a map; Toshiro Mifune and Christopher Lee as the Japanese and German officers in charge of a German built/Japanese owned Submarine prowling off the Pacific coast; Ned Beatty as a gun-crazy patriarch who's home has been selected to quarter a shore-defense artillery cannon; Nancy Allen as a woman in love (and lust) with airplanes; John Candy and Dan Akroyd as the improbably Canadian-sounding crew of an American tank, Robert Stack as the last sane man left alive in California, Warren Oates, various zoot-suiters, maniacs, Japanese sailors and other characters trapped in period clothing.  It's not really successful as comedy (though there was a bit with Eddie Deezen on a Ferris wheel that nearly killed me), and there's no chance that this is effective drama - the characters are too thin, and the plot-lines never really compliment each other.  While there's a great line that hints of the burgeoning racial problems at home, the heartbreaking fear that would faced by some, and the coming internment of the American Japanese are barely hinted.  This would be strong stuff were it made today (the nerve of somebody poking fun at \\"The Greatest Generation\\"!), but much of the poking is scattershot. <br /> <br />WHY YOU MIGHT STILL ENJOY IT: Because it's fun.  There's no forgetting that this flick taps into deep reservoirs of fear and the exuberance of the coming war as an outlet for adventure.  The result is a movie that never slows down enough to remind you that it's just a big mess.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah said in an interview that \\"the voice was always there...it never went away, even on Glitter\\". This new record actually is the return of the voice, per se, because she doesn't moan 3/4 of the song and belt in the last 1/4 as on Charmbracelet. I'm just so happy and satisfied with this new album. Though there is nothing ground-breaking, new or surprising on this pressing, this is Mariah's best album since Butterfly. The album is cohesive as a whole and most of the songs could be potential hits and singles. The album could be best represented by these songs: <br /> <br />1) CIRCLES: A very simple and basic soul song, 70's inspired, where Mariah's amazing vocal takes center stage to carry the whole song and its poignant story. <br /> <br />2) STAY THE NIGHT: This Kanye West track reiterates THE VOICE that made Mariah a star in the first place. With its sexy lyrics and Mariah's soaring honeyed voice, against an old school jam backdrop you can never go wrong. <br /> <br />3) IT'S LIKE THAT: The best uptempo cut in the album JD provides us with the beats and the heat. The perfect party song, the joint is hot and tight, the hook is so catchy and Mariah's vocals and sexiness in top shape. <br /> <br />4) WE BELONG TOGETHER: This is the Mariah we have come to know. Simple and longing, yearning. The beat is a fresh cool storm, perfect for winding down, a definite sing-along favorite, definitely ranks up with Mariah Classic like Always Be My Baby and Can't Let Go. <br /> <br />5) FLY LIKE A BIRD: The soaring finale that definitely empowers and gives hope. Mariah shines and flies like never before, now free and emancipated. A Cliffhanger that finishes the album and leaves you wanting for more. <br /> <br />Go buy this album. This is the Mariah that we used to love and now has come back, bigger and better than ever.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|this was a bad movie. it had no real plot. what it was was REDUNDANT. a bunch of over the top perfect looking people who say the same things over and over..\\"oh come on, be honest\\"...\\"yes, we did it!\\"....\\"your a liar and I hate you!\\"...etc etc etc. It was a mixed up sleeping pill with a dialouge that was completley unrealistic. no one speaks like the people do in this movie! yuck...dont see this film!And the turnaround that natalie portman delivers at the very end is so FAKE! Garbage, straight up garbage.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay's X&Y shows a decent amount of variation from previous recordings, such as their famed A Rush Of Blood To The Head (which by the way is a great CD as well). In that CD, they were well in boundaries of contemporary rock and most definetly set a standard upon themselves for future records that would be just as outstanding. X&Y is this record (hopefully one of the many to come). Coldplay's songs seem to be uncomparable (ie: you can't compare bluegrass with heavymetal) to their previous recordings. Personally, I was instantly spellbound by Fix You, and the excellent way that they use the instruments to create an atmosphere that is so captivating. Additionally, the vocals provide an even better sound to it. What If? is a slow ballad that starts off with the piano. It's the only song that is comparable to songs such as Everythings Not Lost, Beautiful World, and The Scientist to name a few. Honestly, the very beginning off X&Y was quite different. I was expecting a gradual change like from the orchestral background or piano into the vocal parts, however it just started of with the melody. At first I wasn't so big for it, but as a previous reviewer says, after you listen to it a lot you get used to it and it sounds quite normal. Speed Of Sound is another cool song, the melody is upbeat and the whole song is great. One final point I have to make is that Coldplay definitely is a music group that spends time on their songs and makes the best of that time. Lots of artists out their come out with new CD's in months, but the quality is just not there. Coldplay takes a little while for their CD's but the songs are so good they could last till a couple more of their CDs came out. X&Y is definitely a must get.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This is a fantastic take on taking comic books to film. Robert Rodriquez's understanding of the comic book medium is what makes this film so wonderful. Even if you don't like Frank Miller's writing style, you have to appreciate the technical aspects of the film in adapting his stories to the screen. So far most comic book films are just re-created into a new story that is possible for both fans and new viewers to accept. With the exeception of Ghost World, the writer and artist has no real control of the movie. But with Sin City Frank Miller was involved as a director, so the stories stay pretty true to their roots. My only dissapointment is that there are not the traditional extra features of Robert Rodriguez DVD's. Like his 10 minute film school or mini documentaries on how he makes his films. Compared to Once Upon A Time In Mexico with the hours of extra features, I felt a bit shorted on this DVD with only one small featurette.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I have already reviewed this album when it first came out almost 3 years ago, and as they say, the older the wine, the better it tastes--the same applies to this album. STRIPPED gets better after each listen--like you're discovering something new every time you listen to it. No one can deny the vocal talent of Christina, and she puts it to good use on this album by singing each word so thoughtfully that you'll never feel indifferent from the emotions and revelations conveyed in this album. <br /> <br />Stripped is the perfect album to unleash your inner goddess if I may say. It tackles varied genres and could be everyone's cup of tea. The stand out tracks of the album: <br /> <br />1) INFATUATION: A lot of people seem to dislike this song but it is one of the vibrant moments of the album where creative wordplay, sexiness and comic relief come to life. The latin tinged song displays a light side of Christina that the rest of the songs don't exhibit. A fun sing-along song. <br /> <br />2) CRUZ: (Cruise) A guitar based ballad about traveling a new path in life. Christina's voice here is so rich and phenomenal, you will be moved. One of my personal favorites; This is Christina's testimony to breaking the pop mold in a subtle and classy way. <br /> <br />3) GET MINE GET YOURS: The song is about sex...and Christina is no holds barred in this very sexy number. Her vocals are so creamy and dreamy, backed in a tight beat and the orchestration towards the end of the song is great. <br /> <br />4) FIGHTER: One of the more potent songs in the album. Talks about the 3 men that 'wronged' Christina. It is very aggressive and will empower you in a way never before. The tornado vocal delivery is just so strong and the musical arrangement of Dave Navarro's guitars and dramatic strings is what makes this epic. <br /> <br />5) BEAUTIFUL: When Christina recorded this song the first time, she had a lot of wrong notes and flats, but Linda Perry decided to keep it that way to display Christina's vulnerability, and that the true beauty of things lie in the imperfections--true to message of the song. <br /> <br />Give this album a listen and I'm sure you'll find a gem of your own. Although the album sometimes is overcooked, the message shines over the image Christina used to portray this album. All of Christina, just for you.
B00004RFCM|5.0|I love the first season of Sex and the City!  These episodes were fabulous.  Living in New York brings me close to home with these gals!  Anyone who loves this show definately has to get the Complete First Season!
B000065PUE|5.0|What can I say about the Pixies' sound. It is the most unusual music I ever heard, but I love it. This great band from my hometown of Boston are one of my favorite bands. This is their best album too. Black Francis (Frank Black) is a great vocalist and has some great lyrics. Even the not so great lyrics sound good because the music is so good on this album. Kim Deal has equally good vocals and it really shows on the classic track Here Comes Your Man. Favorites include Debaser, Tame, Wave of Mutilation, Here Comes Your Man, Monkey Gone to Heaven, I Bleed, Mr. Grieves, Crackity Jones, There Goes My Gun, Silver, and Gouge Away. Highly Highly Recommended.
B0009VRHLK|5.0|this is one of the BEST films I've seen in my life! seriously. <br /> <br />Of course this film is not for everyone and thank heavens for that! <br />Thank U Mr. Gallo for not giving in to the mainstream hollywood BS!

B0002Z1EG2|5.0|The prime element in Shania's music is fun. Not depth or gloss, or vocal gymnastics, and this is the main reason why Shania has become so successful in the first place. This greatest hits collection packed with 21 meaty cuts proves just that, and believe me, this package is THE essential Shania Twain. <br /> <br />Each song is set to keep the party going, with Shania's flamboyant and sunny lyrics, at times tongue-in-cheek but nevertheless true for all of us. Songs like UP!, DON'T BE STUPID, HONEY I'M HOME and ANY MAN OF MINE are Shania at her best. Shania delivers the beats and riffs in this power album. Of course there are ballads to settle the dust, and when Shania makes one, she makes sure it is THE ballad. Songs like FOREVER AND FOR ALWAYS and wedding staple FROM THIS MOMENT ON sees Shania singing vows of love to make you warm and fuzzy, and ballads like DON'T and the WOMAN IN ME displays Shania's vulnerability and heartfelt emotion in her singing. <br /> <br />As for the new songs, they're just icing on the cake. PARTY FOR TWO, both versions with Mark McGrath and Billy Currington are definite hits, DON'T to slow things down, and I AIN'T NO QUITTER sees Shania singing downright country, (and she's gooood!). <br /> <br />Get this timeless collection, that you'll find yourself singing along with in no time. It is SHANIA at her best. <br />
B0000027DJ|4.0|<br />\\"HEY STOOPID\\" <br /> <br />REVIEW: <br /> <br />After the tremendously successful (but disappointing) album \\"Trash,\\" Alice gets back on track with the Peter Collins produced \\"Hey Stoopid\\". Comparitively to his previous effort, this album is certainly heavier and features more of the dark, sarcastic and witty lyrics that everyone has come to expect from Alice. Nearly all the songs on this album are well-written and catchy hard rock tunes. The standout tracks are \\"Hey Stoopid,\\" \\"Love's A Loaded Gun,\\" the epic \\"Might As Well Be On Mars,\\" \\"Hurricane Years,\\" \\"Die For You\\" and \\"Wind-Up Toy\\".  <br /> <br />MUSICIANS: <br /> <br />Slash - Guitars (1)  <br />Joe Satriani - Guitars (1,4,7,9,12), Backing Vocals (1)  <br />Stef Burns - Guitars (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12)  <br />Steve Vai - Guitars (7)  <br />Vinnie Moore - Guitar (8,11)  <br />Mick Mars - Guitar (10)  <br />Hugh McDonald - Bass (1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12)  <br />Nikki Sixx - Bass (7)  <br />Mickey Curry - Drums (all tracks)  <br />John Webster - Keyboards (1,2,3,4,7,9,10,12), B3 Organ (5)  <br />Steve Croes - Synclavier (1,10)  <br />Robert Bailey - Keyboards (2,5,6,7,8,10,12)  <br />Jai Winding - Keyboards (6)  <br />Chris Boardman - String Arrangements (6)  <br />Backing Vocals - Ozzy Osbourne (1), Zachary Nevel (1)  <br /> <br />INTERESTING FACTS: <br /> <br />1. Released in July of 1991, \\"Hey Stoopid\\" would peak at #47 on the Billboard Top 200. Meanwhile, the title track would peak at US #78. <br /> <br />2. A cover of the classic Jimi Hendrix song, \\"Fire\\" was recorded during the making of this album as a possible inclusion but would eventually turn up on the \\"Love's A Loaded Gun\\" single, as well as \\"The Life And Crimes of Alice Cooper\\" box set and the compilation album, \\"Classicks\\". <br /> <br />3. Alice was featured in a concert scene, performing \\"Feed My Frankenstein,\\" in the hit 1991 film, \\"Wayne's World\\". Later on in the film, while backstage meeting Alice, Wayne and Garth would bow in his presencesaying \\"We're not worthy, we're not worthy!\\" <br /> <br />4. Horror Queen (aka Mistress of the Dark) Elvira says the line \\"He's such a psycho\\" on the recording of the \\"Feed My Frankenstein\\" track. <br /> <br />5. Alice played a series of free concerts (actually mini-concerts) that were performed in various, unexpected places --- from Times Square to atop of record store buildings to public parks. This was dubbed the \\"Nightmare On Your Street\\" Tour. <br /> <br />PACKAGING: <br /> <br />\\"Hey Stoopid\\" is certainly one of the weakest album covers by Alice but the booklet opens up as a poster with all the album's lyrics. <br /> <br />APPROX. RUNNING TIME: <br /> <br />54 min. and 11 sec. <br /> <br />FINAL ANALYSIS: <br /> <br />This is no \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\" but it is an infectiously entertaining album that marked his best effort since 1983's \\"Dada\\". ****1/2 out of 5. <br /> <br />
B00005JL3A|5.0|I saw this when it first came out and I was blown away. The zombies in this film look awesome. Though no characters from the game appear the characters in this film are very strong and so are the actors who play them. The licker in this film is so intense looking, just like in the game. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez are great as the two female leads. My favorite scene is the dog scene. From the director of Event Horizon, Mortal Kombat, and Alien vs. Predator. Highly Recommended.

B0000019PA|5.0|So much has been written about this album, and it usually starts with a hostile declaration that YOU (the reader) must love this album- unless, of course, you want to declare yourself a member of that camp that hates it. I believe there is a middle ground for this album, listeners who won't fit into the clean-cut categories every other reviewer of this album believes exist. Can't there be a confused equivicator out there? Indeed there can be, but I'm proof that there is a way out of the middle ground and into the exalted territory of enjoyment and comprehension that is the \\"lover\\" category. <br /> <br />Ultimately, that's what this album has done to me: it has made me a completely unabashed and enthusiastic admirer of Jeff Mangum and the sleepy terror world he inhabits. The first time through the album, I viewed it through the lenses my past rock experiences had created for me. I listened for harmony and melody, a quick gratification in the form of catchy, listenable hooks and guitar-work. I found it easily in tracks such as \\"King of Carrot Flowers Pt. 1\\", \\"King of Carrot Flowers Pt. 2 & 3\\", \\"In the Aeroplane over the Sea\\", \\"Holland 1945\\", and the untitled 10th track. Beyond that, however, I found the album confusing, murky, and (this is the term I most often found myself using) unnecessary: did Jeff Mangum really HAVE to shriek like that? Was his ear so pathetically ill-equipped to euphony that he thought those sounds on \\"Two-Headed Boy\\" and \\"Oh Comely\\" were actually GOOD? What on earth could my friends see as remotely listenable in this garbage? This deposited me, for a fairly long time, in what the cognoscneti led me to believe was uncharted territory: I neither loved nor hate this album. There were good parts. There were bad parts. It was a pretty good album. <br /> <br />So for the next couple of months, I listened only to those five songs I mentioned earlier, with \\"The Fool\\" mixed in occasionally (if I felt risky!).  For the life of me, I just could not get the hype. Then, one day, in my room after a long day at school or something equally stultifying, I forgot to skip \\"Two Headed Boy, Pt. 1\\". After realizing my mistake, I rushed over to skip the song when I realized....this was good. Letting go of my preconceived notion of rock music as a genre, and allowing Jeff Mangum to wail \\"I am listening to hear where you are,\\" I reached an epiphany- the medium and the message converged into an unidentifiable mass floating from my speakers directly to my soul. I forgot or ignored what I had previously determined about this album. Instead, I allowed simple imagery to develop in my mind and trusted Jeff Mangum to pull me through to the other side. By the end of \\"Two-Headed Boy, Pt. 2\\", (\\"and don't hate her when she gets up to-o-o leeeeaavvve.......\\") I was as confused about an album as I had ever been. No, it wasn't a good \\"rock\\" album- nor was it a good \\"punk\\" album, and it certainly wasn't \\"pop\\". So I ignored it for as long as I could and finally, two days later, I listened to it non-stop maybe four times through. <br /> <br />\\"So THAT's what he's saying!\\" I thought. \\"He's saying...\\" and I knew I had no clue what he was saying; I most likely never would. But that was alright. Jeff Mangum didn't want to be understood- reading interviews and essays about him makes that much abundantly clear. It seems that he wanted to document what he felt was important about an internal world that he felt he might not be strong enough to support- and indeed, with his protracted absence since, he has proved he was unable to sustain it. There is nothing wrong with that- I'm not condemning his as weak. He saw beauty, truth, and pain in a fundamental way that no one else has and he filtered it through beautifully difficult noise in a painfully short but ultimately perfect album. <br /> <br />This album is like none other you will listen to. Given time, patience, and effort, however, it just might become the best one you will ever listen to.
B0000024YL|4.0|One thing strikes me after listening to this album again, and that's how Paul  Simon's talents and prowess as a singer-songwriter just about overtook S&G as a duo--it's really his show, and though Art Garfunkel adds extremely pretty harmonies and an amazing lead vocal on the justifiably famous \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\", he seems to have very little input. This compilation has probably been eclipsed by now in the wake of box-sets and bargain comps; yet, if so, those could surely do better by not including the live tracks. Both \\"The 59th Street Bridge Song\\" and \\"Homeward Bound\\" are the live versions, and while not awful, are brought down by an applause-happy audience. Is there some kind of rule that we can't have all the best songs in one place? The applause even carries over into the following studio tracks! Certainly the rest of this CD makes up for the gaffes, and the evocative, bracing \\"Bookends\\" and jubuliant \\"Cecilia\\" never grow tired. An amazing, stirring, tender body of work.
B000002BFL|5.0|The second acoustic album by Bruce Springsteen is a very underrated album. It is also very like Nebraska in a storytelling sense. The only problem is this album has synths added and it seems not as demo like as Nebraska was. The title track is also the best song on the album and one of Springsteen's best written songs. Rage Against the Machine would later do it over, but it will never be as good as this. Favorites include The Ghost of Tom Joad, Highway 29, Youngstown, Sinaloa Cowboys, Balboa Park, New Timer, Across the Border, and My Best Was Never Good Enough. Highly Highly Recommended.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great series.  Just no getting around it.  Whedon's vision is amazing and with the movie \\"Serenity\\" coming out in the fall, there's no better time to order.<br /><br />No power in the 'Verse can stop us!

I like the scene where Fiona is fighting Robin Hood and his men. Classic!<br /><br />So If you haven't seen this, see it, better yet buy it!

0767834739|5.0|The sequel to Resident Evil is one of those movies that is so to surpass the original. It is a really good movie but it does not have alot of character development as the first one really did have. But it is still a really good movie. The action scenes are alot more artistic than in the original and the zombies and creatures (NEMESIS!) look awesome. My favorite character is L.J. played hilariously by Mike Epps. This is also the film that includes Jill Valentine from the game played here by Sienna Guillory. Oded Fehr is also good as Carlos. Directed by Alexander Witt and written by Paul W.S. Anderson, who directed the first film. Recommended.
020530902X|4.0|This book is less than 100 pages long but it has lots of information about grammar, idioms and dictions that people often ignore and use misleadingly. Especially, nowadays when colloquial English dominated our language in advertisements, magazines and other media, this book is a easy-to-read guide to make us aware of the mistakes we are making. I mean, just the fact that E.B. White, a master storyteller, wrote this book has some credentials, don't you think?<br /><br />I like how he explains things using a very common language (although this book was originally written for YALE students) and support what he means by providing examples. I thought this was a perfect guide to prepare students for the SAT tests or just improve one's writing in general, because he pinpoints common mistakes everyone makes. For example, a lot of people say \\"I try and do that\\" but grammatically and logically, it should be \\"I try to do that\\". Instead of looking through hundreds of pages of textbook which really will say the same things in vague words, just read this and you will be amazed at how much you can learn!<br /><br />However, it should be marked down a little because he assumes too much things from the readers. The author, E.B. White, assumes that we know grammatical vocabularies like indirect or direct pronouns which can be very confusing. So if you are a beginner in grammar, this book should come later on the road.<br /><br />Otherwise, it was a very informative and helpful read.
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|this is a wonderful \\"feel good\\" cd. <br /> <br />it lifts your spirits and is just great. its very varied on its musical styles, from african to just simple pop. i love this cd so much, no matter the mood, it cheers me up. <br /> <br />some of my favorite songs...diamonds on the soles of her shoes, and boy in the bubble. <br /> <br />lovely and grand!
B00005JNTX|4.0|I have to say that I wasn't blown away by this movie due to the fact that I knew exactly what was going to happen and how it was going to happen. Not that that's really a bad thing, the sin city comics were great and this movie was perfect. It's obvious that Robert Rodriguez didn't make an adaptation of Frank Miller's comics, he basically put the books onscreen. And I mean he made the movie exactly like the books right down to the teeth. The look of this movie is so great I consider it eye candy. I love how the movie was shot in front of the green screen (even though that's totally unethical movie making) to make the picture look just like the black and white world of Frank Miller. The action was also very good, especially the fight between Kevin (Elijah) and Marv (Mickey). My complaints we're that a couple of the main character's acting was pretty stiff. It's obvious that no matter who she plays and how beautiful she is that Jessica Alba isn't a very good actress. Also suprisingly Clive Owen was probably the worst actor on the screen. He could have added so much more depth and realizm to Dwight but he screwed that up. I don't mean to be picky but Nick Stahl is a good actor but it was something about him that made him not capture the creepyness and bad guy feel of yellow bastard. My only complaints were some of the acting. Although Brittany Murphy, Benecio del Turro, Bruce Willis, and Mickey Rourke were very good at there parts. If your a fan of the movie you'll love it, if your not you will still love it. And by the way let's talk about the violence. I can't make up my mind on whether or not it was normal for an R rated movie or if it was too overdone. Because a lot of the blood is computerized to look white. When Jackie Boy got his hand cut off it looked like bird crap was coming out of his wrist. Most of the blood though is red or black, and it seems to flow from the characters like water a lot of the time and is all over the place. Plus there is some nudity. Sonot appropriate for some viewers, not to mention the castrating.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This is a really good album by Beck and is alot better than Guero IMO. Alot more mellow than his other stuff, Beck writes songs about lost love, being alone, and war. The music is intense and very dark. Beck's voice is equally dark and gives me chills at times. The song Lost Cause is a real beautiful song and should be a classic. Favorites include The Golden Age, Paper Tiger, Guess I'm Doin' Fine, Lonesome Tears, Lost Cause, End Of The Day, Already Dead, and Little One. Highly Recommended.
B000002JSP|2.0|As far as Led Zeppelin goes, in through the out door is not the greatest you could buy. Of course it contains the great \\"All of My Love,\\" but most of the other tracks on the album are not good. I think you'll find them repetetive and boring. I gave most of the songs 2 stars on my iTunes.<br /><br />If you are looking to buy some Zeppelin, may I reccomend \\"Lez Zeppelin IV,\\" the original \\"Led Zeppelin,\\" or if your looking for some good zep in the later days, i reccomend \\"physical graffiti\\"
B00003CX8Y|5.0|The only animated feature to be nominated for \\"Best Picture\\", this film was the peak of Disney's artistic musical animations. Right after the success of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" Disney went ahead with \\"Beauty & the Beast\\" (Walt Disney wanted to do the film for years and sadly didn't live to see it realized). But today it is great to remember Disney during its artistic Renaissance (From \\"The Little Mermaid to \\"The Lion King\\"). \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" has not only great musical numbers, and beautiful backgrounds, but also great characters and an emotionally appealing story. While I think the only realistic character (in terms of motivation and emotion) was the Beast, I found that Belle was a well-realized heroine who in a twist saves the hero with her emotional strength and kindness. The timelessness of the story was well brought out in the title song that played during one of the most romantic scenes ever in animation. This is a film that shows the importance of looking for the beauty within. It also celebrates the life-changing effects that friendship and love can bring. A Masterpiece.

B0000029AP|5.0|This is probably Aerosmith's best put together record of their earlier albums. The mixture of hard rock and blues is really good. Steve Tyler's voice is awesome being accompied by Joe Perry's raging guitar rifts. This album also has two of the band's most well known hits, Walk This Way and Sweet Emotion. Also has a great bluesy track Big Ten Inch Record. Favorites include Toys In The Attic, Adam's Apple, Walk This Way, Big Ten Inch Record, Sweet Emotion, No More No More, and You See Me Crying. Highly Highly Recommended.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This album is a compilation of songs from a 2 live Led Zeppelin Performances, one in the Long Beach Arena, and one in the LA forum. If your a Zeppelin fan, you need this CD.<br /><br />Although the \\"Immigrant Song\\" is a little Disappointing, everything else is completely amazing. The solo on Heartbreaker is to die for (and listen closely if your also a Tenacious D fan), Black Dog starts out with the beggining of Out on the Tiles, Over the Hills and Far Away is 10 times better than the original recording, The live Stairway to Heaven may infact bring you to orgasm, and thats just some of the hilights of the first disc. on the second disc there's an astounding 25 minute Dazed and Confused, and for the drummers, there's a 19:20 version of Moby Dick. On the third disc the main hilight is the long version of Whole Lotta Love.<br /><br />Overall its an amazing compilation that is a necessary component to any true Zeppelin fan's collection.<br /><br />BUY THIS CD RIGHT NOW!

B00062RBOA|5.0|This is one of Carlos Kleiber's last concerts, filmed live in 1996 in the Herkulesalle, in Munich.  Kleiber looks more elderly and frail (he was just 66) than he did in the 1983 Beethoven Symphonies 4,7 with the Concertgebouw Orchestra (Philips DVD), or the 1991 Brahms Symphony 2 (Philips DVD) also in late 2004.  There is a special sense of occasion here:the orchestra and audience clearly love Kleiber, the orchestra playing with a special spirit and elan for him. <br /> <br />Beethoven's CORIOLAN Overture is very dramatic and tragic, creating a powerful effect.  Mozart's 33rd Symphony, one less often played than the later Symphonies 35, 36, 38-41, is done lovingly, yet without the slower tempo for I used by some conductors such as Bohm (DG CD, with complete Mozart Symphonies) or Wordsworth (Naxos CD).  The Brahms Symphony 4 is beautifully played, although some might find the Passacaglia IV a bit poker faced nearing the end: not dramatic or emotional enough in the final bars.  Kleiber seems to rush through a few passages other conductors, such as Steinberg (MCA CD) lingered over.  But this is a great concert, and I would be thrilled to hear it in person. <br /> <br />The picture is excellent, widescreen.  Camera work is terrific, and always serves the music: never invasive or distracting.  Watching this makes me regret there will be no future videos or CDs from Carlos Kleiber, and I'm a bigger fan of Bohm, Furtwangler, Bernstein, and Ormandy.  This is a great DVD: anyone liking Classical music videos will be pleased.
B000AU9UYM|4.0|i liked Begins just as much as the next guy, but it wasnt my total cup of tea. i remember the days of keaton as batman and when compared to bale, you could cleary see whos the more badass: Keaton. yes, Keaton. Bale was a good bruce wayne, but a horrible batman. ppl who are expecting a batman movie will be a bit dissapointed. this is more like (im not making this up) \\"bruce wayne\\" begins, and i just wish there was more \\"batman action\\" in it. i enjoyed the movie as a \\"movie\\", but not so much as a \\"batman\\" movie. that one is for keaton.     in short, bale is a great bruce wayne, horriblr batman.     the rest of the cast is good, great even. i recomend this film to anyone who loves a good al round movie, but if your looking for batman action and iconic moments, look no further then BATMAN (1989) and Batman Returns (1992).     oh and christian bales \\"im batman\\" sucked. just thought i'd let you know. keaton owns that line.    ppl who say that jack stole the show in Batman (1989) should be slapped, cuz he did not. i hardly remember anything about the joker, all i remember is keatons awsome seriousness and brooding nature, IMO the PERFECT batman, the way he should be. also, that scene with flass made me hyserical. i just couldnt take his constipated-looking forced-angry face seriously. his mouth in that scene looked like he was about to blow up, LOL. srry, just the truth. and whats with ppl saying this batman \\"finally got it right\\" B.S.? keatons batman and the seuqel batman returns seemed to hit the spirit of batman quite good and stood true to the spirit of bob kane, creators, original vision of the character, so no point in saying \\"bale got it right\\" when thats not entirely true. in the comics, liam neesons character \\"ras al guhl\\" NEVER tranied bruce wayne, and was NOT also called ducard. its simply canon, alsong with that silly \\"microwave weapon\\" plot canon. meant to be real? okay....ive heard some wacko explanations for this thing, but its simply canon, just like the jokers \\"smilex gas\\" weapon in B89 (whcih i find more believeable then this \\"emitter\\" crap). also, bales batman simply wouldnt SHUT UP. thats what i loved about keaton, he was angry but with a sense of restrant and controlled anger, all the while not blowing up in ppls faces like a crazed bale, oops, i mean batman.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|and bill murry is worthy of the other 2.i guess hollywood is trying its best to cuddle sofia into feeling better after her disgustingly horrible killing of what could have been the greatest triolgy ever.is it any wonder she has yet to be seen in a movie since?!?!?!?shes just ok as a film maker and those giving her props are just being sympathetic.this movie itself is droll and uninvolving,unbelievable and dull.in fact,let me change that 3 to a 2......
B00005JNTX|5.0|I wanted to dislike this film, I really did.  But it just reminded me of some critics who do not seem to understand that movies don't have to be the same old scene, and that maybe some movies can be adapted from a rather incredible source and honor that source by mimicking the style of the source so successfully that anyone who is familiar with said source material will be transfixed, amazed, and comforted that movies are not doomed (just Hollywood).  If this was to be adapted from a standard novel would the source material be used so literally?  Of course not - standard novels are not a series of pictures that are easily interpreted as storyboards.  This film was all style and substance, and to think otherwise indicates too much distraction in the critic's heart when considering how different this movie is from others.  It's not a Merchant Ivory film, it's not a Lion's Gate film, it's a pulp noir that looks about as perfect as the 2-D technology allows.  A Sin City story could not be appropriately told without the heavy contrast of black and white.  Great story, fascinating and memorable characters, and well-shot action.  It gets one star for Rutger Hauer's too-short performance, and four more for (fot) everything else.

1573223026|4.0|When I read this was a very funny book about four people who try to commit suicide, I was intrigued.  I had never read a book by Nick Hornby, but couldn't imagine how such a serious subject could be treated lightly and still be in good taste.  Amazingly, Hornby seems to pull this feat off exceedingly well for even though you are saddened by their situations, the laugh-out-loud moments are many and the emotional delving that is done with intelligence and wit make this a rewarding read.<br /><br />The four protagonists are: Martin, a tv talk-show host whose antics invite public humiliation; Maureen, an older woman and mother of a son who is more vegetable than human; Jess, a young girl who redefines the term deranged personality; and JJ, an American rock star wannabe dropped by both his band and his girl.  When these four lost souls meet at the top of a London tower on New Year's Eve, a most unlikely bonding occurs.<br /><br />Hornby explores the reasons people are brought to the brink of suicide, the reasons some jump and some don't, and most importantly, what it is that makes unhappy people keep on plugging away at finding a better life.<br /><br />The writer does an excellent job of giving each of the protagonists a unique voice.  While the story is told in rotation by each of the four, the reader is never confused as to the person narrating, and that is a remarkable accomplishment, especially since he writes in first person as old, young, male, and female.<br /><br />Both grim and humorous, and liberally laced with pop culture references, this is a book you'll want to think about long after the last page is read.
B000002V07|5.0|Hope Sandoval knows where you are and she can help you find your way again. Every time I come to a point in my life when I really feel disconnected, Mazzy Star is always there to help me through.      <br /> <br />Some reviewers state that this disc is pretentious, but I disagree completely. Sometimes people mistake honesty for pretentiousness and this is one very honest collection of songs. I have no idea what Hope Sandoval and David Roback have been through in their lives, but I do know they are deep and feeling individuals that have managed to pour themselves into their work. So Tonight That I Might See is truly a masterpiece of sorrow, pain, sadness, death, loss and true love. Spiritual. Honest. Devestating. Hope.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|Best. TV Soundtrack. Ever. <br /> <br />This comment only has one caveat, which is to remind everyone that the soundtrack for the tragically short-lived Firefly was never released.  Had it been, it would have surely been in the running, if not tied for first place. <br /> <br />But, excluding that: this is the most diverse, most brilliant, most thrilling soundtrack I've listened to.  It brings together Eastern themes (like taiko drums -- one of the soundtrack's main instruments), Celtic influence, classical strings, and modern synth...even opera. <br /> <br />Those of us who initially watched the first season during its run in the UK on SkyOne will recognize the last track as what I like to call the Real Theme.  The one SciFi used during the first season was actually just a piece of score from the episode Act of Contrition, featured in the track 'Two Funerals'.  The Real Theme is far superior, and luckily SciFi has chosen to use it for its second season. <br /> <br />Prologue is the little interlude used to set up the show's mytharc at the beginning of each episodes. \\"The Cylons were created by Man...\\"  Honestly, this track gives me the shivers.  It's exciting, it hints at the grandeur and the epic nature of the series -- it's just plain thrilling. <br /> <br />Then we have the Main Title, which I've spoken of.  Lame.  The end. <br /> <br />Helo's Chase is just another wonderful example of the melting pot of instruments and influences.  Tibetan chanting, computerized synth-y noises, and the taiko drums. <br /> <br />The Olympic Carrier is another drum heavy piece, with a buzzing element which serves to perfectly, musically represent the Cylons.  Mid-through the piece, an Arabian-styled woodwind breaks through. <br /> <br />Helo Rescued is short, almost New Age-y, and definitely reminiscent of Christophe Beck's score for BtVS' Restless.  This is a familiar influence throughout the soundtrack. <br /> <br />A Good Lighter.  I'm not sure why they stick this in at the 6th track, as the rest of the soundtrack seems to run chronologically along with the episodes, but it serves to introduce the Irish flutes and uilleann pipes that to me, represent the Adamas and the lighter Bill gives to Lee in Hand of God.  Very wistful, longing, sad. <br /> <br />We launch back into the taiko drums with The Thousandth Landing, and again we're pulled along by the Arabian minor flutes highlighted with zylls. <br /> <br />Two Funerals is again reminiscent of Beck's score and including more of the Arabian flutes: what I think of and will now refer to as \\"River's flute\\" (a theme of the Firefly score). In the end it launches into a military drum beat, which is what became the \\"Main Theme\\" on SciFi's airing. <br /> <br />Starbuck Takes On All Eight is a similar (read: taiko-y!) track to most of the above, this time incorporating what seems to be Native American chanting and a string background.  More the Arabian flutes too.  Carrying on. <br /> <br />Forgiven.  A sad song, slightly reprising the theme from Two Funerals (makes sense, given that it was part of a continuing storyline), but this time with vaguely Enyaesque vocals and strings.  River's flute makes an appearance. <br /> <br />The Card Game is more modern, with trip-hoppy beats, bongos, and River's flute creating an eerie mood. <br /> <br />Starbuck On The Red Moon.  Taiko time!  River's flute verges on sounding almost uilleann; the song has a diverse, shifting time signature and is very beat driven.  More Enyaesque vocals. <br /> <br />Helo In The Warehouse is similar to the other Helo tracks [one of the things I love about McCreary's score is that he very clearly creates different atmospheres, different places with his score] when it starts out, with the synth and the quiet vastness, but then launches into an explosion of taikos in the end. <br /> <br />Baltar Speaks With Adama.  River's flute is soft and subtle this time, backed by synthy strings, until the end brings in some more, wait for it, taiko drums. <br /> <br />Two Boomers reflects the Helo themes, bringing in some more strings and what sounds like a saxophone.  Then it launches into a very modern, Matrix-y, guitar techno chase, and fades out. <br /> <br />Battlestar Operatica...in a word?  Hysterical.  It's written as a traditional Italian opera, but take a look at the lyrics: \\"Woe upon your Cylon heart/There's a toaster in your head/And it wears high heels/Number Six calls to you/The Cylon Detector beckons/Your girlfriend is a toaster.\\"  It brings in shades of a traditonal string composition that I can't for the life of me remember the name of, although it's been used endlessly in films. <br /> <br />The Dinner Party is an absolute perfect background for the oddest dinner party you'll see from Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down [on this soundtrack referred to as Secrets and Lies].  The scene reminds me of a French farce, a bawdy Restoration comedy, and the music fits right in with that. <br /> <br />Battlestar Muzaktica is from a scene in Colonial Day I've apparently forgotten. It's...muzak.  Don't listen to this track if anyone's listening in, because only you'll get the joke and they'll be left wondering why you're listening to muzak. <br /> <br />Baltar Panics!  This means taikos!  Irish flutes played in an Arabian style!  [There's got to be a word for that.] Ends softly with River's flute and synth strings. <br /> <br />Boomer Flees.  Shades of Helo themes.  Again, breaking into the taikos that get complemented by some epic sounding vocals. <br /> <br />Flesh And Bone is eerie, though it sounds very impressive with the taikos, and fades into River's flute.  There's something wrong, and you can hear it.  This time McCreary brings in what sounds like a Spanish acoustic guitar, but at times dissonant.  The uilleann pipe goes all Arabian on us.  It ends with a synthy noise heard in the Helo scenes. <br /> <br />Battle On The Asteroid is one of my absolute favourites.  Starts with a Lord-of-the-Rings-y tune by River's flute, and cymbals build up to the taikos.  It breaks, starts again, builds up, River's flute comes in, and then, the smartest idea McCreary ever had: contrasting the taikos with bagpipes.  Given the vast military scope of this scene, it's pure genius.  We get some computery noises that seem to represent the Cylon centurions.  River's flute comes back Arabian again, and then the bagpipes counter the taikos some more.  Some of what may be tablas pop up,  then some traditional strings [reminiscent of Klaus Badelt's Pirates of the Caribbean score], then the bagpipes again, then an Irish flute.  There's a lull, that is brought back again with some fast tablas that break into the bagpipes again and quiet down for River's flute, which is sounding very Irish now.  Everything goes Arabian again, and fades out until a taiko explosion ends it. <br /> <br />One of my friends described Wander My Friends as \\"Titanic-core\\" which: heh.  But it's the uillean pipes returning with the theme from A Good Lighter, and this time some Gaelic vocals that turn into a resounding chorus of celebration.  It's a perfect fit for the champagne-popping joy of Lee's victory.  In English: \\"Wander my friends, wander with me/Like the mist on the green mountain, moving eternally...\\" <br /> <br />We come in on the lynchpin of the soundtrack: Passacaglia.  Cited by most fans as their favourite track, this is the genius string piece placed against the montage of self-destruction that began Kobol's Last Gleaming, Part one.  It's epic and paced, foreboding and wondrous, self-regulating and bursting at the seams with tension.  If anything, listen to this song.  This song killed my iTunes. <br /> <br />Kobol's Last Gleaming reminds me of a mixture of Howard Shore's LotR score and Christophe Beck's Restless score.  Opens with some chanting prophetic Latin lyrics that blend with River's flute.  This is the perfect track for the discovery of the planet Kobol; it's a feeling of awe and ancient history mixed with new danger. <br /> <br />Destiny is similar to Kobol's Last Gleaming, only this time using an Arabian string instrument I can't think of [not a sitar?], and bringing in the taikos for one last glorious procession.  There's more of a different Arabian string instrument, more rhythmic than the first, that fades into tabla drums, which then brings back the taikos and River's flute...and it all ends with an explosion of strings. <br /> <br />The Shape Of Things To Come.  This is Passacaglia gone crazy.  It's technically just a faster version of Passacaglia, but the urgency and the revelation in it would make me [were the track longer] declare it my favourite.  This track is forever tied with the image of Six leading Gaius into the ruins on Kobol which become a glorious palace.  It's epic.  Epic times ten. <br /> <br />Bloodshed.  If you haven't seen the end of Kobol's Last Gleaming Part Two, I won't spoil it.  But this track (repeating the Latin chanting vocals from KLG) is a perfect shock and requiem in strings and silence.  Definite Christophe Beck influences.  The end is a perfect match for the shocking cut to the black, to the \\"To Be Continued...\\" <br /> <br />Re-Cap.  The synthy beats played over the \\"Previously on Battlestar Galactica...\\"  Very anticipatory, like the Prologue.  Rightfully so. <br /> <br />Main Theme (UK Version):  I can't really put into words how much this is the perfect theme for the show.  The vocals are part of the Gayatri Mantra, an ancient Hindu mantra.  And then!  The shout, launching into the TAIKOS, which accelerate and then explode.  Bear McCreary is master of taiko usage.  If you listen to this track with good subwoofers...it's like nothing else you've ever heard. <br /> <br />And that is my rambly --possibly inaccurate in the naming of certain instruments and styles-- review.

B00005V1Y0|5.0|This first of Baz Luhrmann's \\"red curtain movies\\" tells it's story through classic ballroom dance.  Set in Australia, this modern fairy tale of a movie tells the story of Scott Hastings, a young dancer from a family of dancers who is tired of \\"dancing somebody else's steps all the time.\\"  His favorite pastime is making up his OWN steps, but that doesn't win him competitions.  When his partner finally gets fed up and drops him, he has to find a new partner. <br /> <br />Enter Fran.  Frumpy, shy Fran who comes from a poor Spanish neighborhood and has only been dancing for two years --- with a GIRL! <br /> <br />When she approaches Scott to propose they dance together, Scott's initial reaction is arrogant disbelief.  But she convinces him to give her a tryout for just an hour.  As they continue to dance, Scott sees in her something that no one else has --- and he is somehow drawn to this ugly duckling creature.  Especially when she breaks out into a step he's never seen before and he wants to try it! <br /> <br />As the story unfolds, Scott and Fran learn more about each other, both as dancers and as people.  Fran comes out of her shell more and more, shedding the ugly duckling persona and slowly becoming the swan she was meant to be. <br /> <br />And Scott finds what he's been looking for, too.  One night at a party at Fran's house, he demonstrates a Paso Doble --- the traditional Spanish dance.  Full of his usual cockiness, knowing full well how good a dancer he is, he thinks he'll wow her family with his knowledge of this dance.  When they laugh at him, he becomes indignant --- and then Fran's father shows her what a REAL Paso Doble looks like.  And Scott knows that THIS is exactly what he's been trying to find in his own dancing. <br /> <br />Peppered with fun characters --- including Scott's best friend and his fiancee, the corrupt chairman of the dance council, Fran's spunky grandmother and severe father, Scott's nutty mother and quiet father with his mysteriouspast, Ken Railings the oozing-charm-from-every-arrogant-pore professional champion, and Tina Sparkle, who Scott's parents try to get him to dance with --- this film creates a delightful and hilarious atmosphere.  The story of his father's past comes out throughout the course of the movie.  Nasty politics run rampant in the dance council.  And Scott has difficulty balancing his dance life with the romance he begins to feel with Fran. <br /> <br />From the very start, when the red curtain opens to the strains of \\"The Blue Danube,\\" I adored this movie.  And it kept me charmed until the very end.  The romance was sweet, the dancing was fun to watch --- particularly Scott and Fran's Paso Doble at the end of the film --- the music was fabulous, and the story was clean and well-thought-out.  The entire film is spiced with Luhrmann's odd, kooky style.  It's sheer delight.  I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for this movie --- it was the first time I ever considered trying to do ballroom dancing myself, this movie started my obsession with the sport!  This light-hearted romp is the perfect way to relax and laugh.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|This seem to be the sum of all the worst parts of every single movie made since 2000 put into one.<br /><br />You cannot like, respect or even understand the motive of anyone in this movie.<br /><br />On the Troy side, we got the fools and the cowards, they steal someone else wife, and go to war for it, they cannot even have a normal duel without resorting to cheating, and are looking so foolish in the process, that you wish they all get killed.<br /><br />The Greek, we have the mad and again the fools, they are portrayed as evil monster, but very dumb, so you can't even take for them either, so now you hope that both armies killed each other off.<br /><br />So it leave us hopping Brad can do a nice job... LOL I can't believe I just wrote this.  He is the worst part of the whole movie, he kills anyone without any feeling, soldiers, innocent un-armed priest, anyone, yet, he try to seduce a prisoner, and the worst is, IT WORKS, \\"You came in my temple, killed all the un-armed priests, friend and relative I had there... oh, I love you so much Brad !!! What ever! I rented it, and tried to got my money back, first time I ever tried this.
B000021Y7X|5.0|This is the best concert DVD I have EVER seen. The energy is AMAZING. EVERYBODY should see this. After watching this DVD and not knowing anything about the Talking Heads other than a couple hit singles back in the 80s, I fell in love with the band. It made me run out and buy all the Talking Heads cds I could find. I would also recommend the Talking Heads- Once In A Lifetime boxset to anyone who is a fan. WOW!!!
B00007KWHG|5.0|I really like this compilation of the group's hits. Some I didnt even realize were hits of thiers.I liked the liner notes too, telling their story.
B00008G7UF|5.0|French kiss is a brilliant romantic comedy bringing together Kevin Kline and the queen of romantic comedies Meg Ryan. Ryan plays a woman who journies to Paris to find her fiance, who has ran off with a beautiful young frenchwoman. In to the mix is added Kevin Kline of A fish Called Wanda fame, who is French theif trying to smuggle in jewlary using Ryan as the courier without her knowledge. <br /> <br />The story goes on with the three characters chasing each other throughout Paris and France, each wanting something from the other but not knowing what exactly.  <br /> <br />I really thought this movie was clever and funny, and would recommend watching it.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I'm writing in only to offer a little insight concerning the answer to a question that has been often posed concerning The Way Up--namely, \\"Where is the music?\\" \\"Shifting keys without purpose\\" etc...<br /><br />Though I cannot speak for the entirety of the piece (there's a lot to speak for), I would like to point out that from my observations, there is nothing in the composition that is without purpose. The very same harmonic changes that caused people to fall in love with Metheny and Mays' music in the 80s and 90s are still there--the compositional structure is simply more complex, so that what once was a harmonic progression that one could hear outright is now precendented, or rather separated, by more harmonic changes that nevertheless still arrive on time and right where the music needs to be.<br /><br />As for the piece itself--it can actually be divided into two near-symmetrical sections, if not more--so that each block of the piece is actually repeated somewhere in the second half of the song. Compare Metheny's early acoustic guitar double-stops (the beginning of Part I) with Maret's harmonica solo in the middle of Part II. You'll begin to see what I mean, if you have not already. The entire composition has purpose, structure, and place--and the fact that it is so long and so complex is only further testament to its greatness.<br /><br />I am not trying to change any nay-sayers' minds, necessarily; I simply wanted to speak in favor of TWU without merely talking about how beautiful I think it is or how deeply listening to it moves me--fighting fire with fire, so to speak. Appreciating this composition is as much a matter of musical observation as it is emotional involvement, and both must be present in order to get the most out of it--perhaps this is exactly what Metheny wanted.<br /><br />That being said...<br /><br />(glances around)<br /><br />GO PMG!!!!
B00006CXSS|4.0|I really liked this DVD, it reminded me a lot of the movie Saving Private Ryan. I believe this series was produced by the sam team that did Saving Private Ryan.  <br /> <br />This series is brillaintly produced and directed and gives you insight into a WWII soldiers prespective from their point. These are actual soldiers who served in this company, and it tracks the events that shaped their lives from D-DAY then unto the end of the war. <br /> <br />I believe that once you start this series you will not stop until you finish.
0399237720|2.0|My son loved this book and so did we, until he was left alone with it.  Then he decided to pull it apart. Now, it's in the garbage.
B00005JNEW|3.0|I really liked this movie as an entertaining football flick. Billy Bob Thornton did a great job. The kids played their parts well too. I did not like the fact that I sat through that whole movie just to see them loose the supposed \\"5-A State Championship\\". <br /> <br />I did some research just to see how long coach Gary Gaines lasted as a coach. Wasn't long. I did find the actual site as well for the Permian Panthers. In 1988 Permian lost in the State Semi-Finals, not State according to the site. It says Dallas Carter beat them 14-9 in the semi-finals. Is this correct? ([...]) That really ruined it for me. I wouldn't have cared but now the true story is the Panthers made it 3/4 of the way and lost. And they made a movie about that? They should have just made the movie about the 89' State Championship team instead. <br /> <br />Oh well. It's only for \\"entertainment purpose\\" anyways. <br /> <br />I'd still suggest it, just tell people to ignore the true story thing a bit. There's a big difference between playing for State and just making the State Semi-Finals.
B000002SE0|5.0|If one has to ask me to mention one of the greatest tenors ever, Franco Corelli would be on top of the list. And this should be one of the greatest ever recordings which were fortunately registered and passed down to us and with very good sound even. Calaf should be one of the greatest roles which Corelli sung on stage maybe only equalled by the role of Manrico in Il Trovatore, and this recording captures the animal-stamina well known from this fabulous singer. The cast who accompanies him is none the less. Renata Scotto is at her best as the slave-girl Liu' giving a very sensitive performance whilst Birgit Nilsson gives a heroic rendering in the role of the icy Princess Turnandot. Obviously one cannot not mention the great Puccini, for whom generations of opera lovers should be indebted for the ceative power and energy along with immortal melodies only he could give us - and definitely Turandot should be one of his colossal achievements which put great pressure on opera singers.  <br /> <br />For me this recording is one of the most important historically - the cast is top noch and even the reading of Francesco Molinari-Pradelli is a one of the best I heard on record. EMI has managed to give us a good sound - well balanced and clear for this 1966 recording. Definitely with Corelli as Calaf divine as ever, it should be a must for all Opera lovers.
B00005JMEW|3.0|You must put in the product description, where subtitles is on. In this DVD said spanish subtitles, but they are only in the movie, and not in the extras.
B0009IW88A|5.0|In this new Batman series the cast and director has changed. And so has the composer. Actually one of the biggest films of the year is scored by two composers that are best friends and have always wanted to work together on a project. They are none other than Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard. Two established and leading composers of this age. By listening to this score the first two tracks you can clearly tell the sound is pure Zimmer using his usual dynamic synthesizers and while there is an orchestra its there for Howard. The listener can tell when its Howard and when its Zimmer. Being a big fan of Zimmer and adoring his scores to the Peacemaker, Drop Zone, Pacific Heights, Backdraft, and Gladiator this one is unlike his previous compositions. This one is dark, brooding, and mysterious yet it is very fun to listen to. Though Hans is known as an 'action music' composer so we never really get enough of his horror music. Well, anyone how is like Me and wants more dark music from this great composer then look no further than Batman Begins! The album starts out with the sound of enormous bat wings flapping away! There are some other bat noises created by electronic and orchestral strings in track five which this one a scary one. The score has a theme and a two sub-themes. In My opinion they are much different than the themes that Danny Elfman and Elliot Goldenthal composes for the earlier films. The sixth track is also a great one. The main theme is in full force in track ten and its an incredible listen! Two things I love what Zimmer does in this score is in track three he uses a huge bell sound and there is a moment in track four where a children's choir is present. It sounds really gothic. Howard's love theme is really a dramatic one and is remicent of his earlier works such as the Village. Its quite lovely. In fact, Zimmer and Howard takes a different approach to this Batman score than the other greats did with their's. The entire score is really perfect for thefilm. I love the other scores that Elfman composed and I thought that Goldenthal did terrific job as well but this one is the most different of all of them and the most dynamic. I think this score is Oscar quality, no question about it! If you are a big fan of these composers I strongly recommned you purchase Batman Begins today!
B0000AQS0F|3.0|After reading such glowing reviews I was really eager to sink my teeth onto this show. And after the first couple episoides I was hooked. But then.... the storylines just didn't live up to the early promise. Subplots were weak on non existant. Capt. Reynolds seemed to inexplicably punch someone in the face every 15 minutes. And throughout the remainder of the box set I kept praying the Reavers would show up - they seemed one of the most exciting story elements and yet they never got used after the first two episodes. No doubt they would have had the series continued, and maybe they'll be in the movie. <br /> <br />I am definitely a fan of good television, and I certainly think Deadwood, Six Feet and Arrested Development deserve their frequent 5 star ratings. Firefly had the potential, but the series as a whole didn't live up to the promise. At last for me.
B00005JNTX|1.0|I wanted to like this film, i really did. But it just reaked of some lame video game storyline all linked together. It is true to the source material but when adapting a comic to another formal you need to adjust it to that format. This has not been done here. In essence you get a moving graphic novel. If this was to be adapted to a novelisation would the source material be used so literally. I think not. This film was all style over substance. Bad story, lame characters, lame action. It gets one star for Rutger Heurs great performace.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|A seminal album when it was first released but sadly overlooked.   Jack White's notes in this cd reissue pretty much sum up the importance of this album .  It defines American rock music -but still sounds years ahead of its time.   There are numerous influences buried in here -Sun Ra, John Coltrane, [a hint of] blues, the Doors, Hendrix, Beefheart, etc- but this was, and remains, a unique album that actually sounds better with age.   What really stuck me was how well the album flows.  Although the Stooges were not particularly noted for their musical virtuosity (nothing wrong with that) these tracks had, by the time of the recording, been finely honed to perfection on the road.  This also finds the band on the cusp of self-destruction but at their creative (substance fuelled) peak.    Many of the vocals were live takes, but this is vital to the raw sound.      <br />Overall, this is an incredibly powerful album and represents a real hybrid of the free- form acid drenched jamming of the last sixties, whilst looking forward to punk, new wave and grunge!   <br /> <br />It would be wrong to use the term \\"deluxe edition\\" on a Stooges release!  However it is worth mentioning the quality of this cd upgrade.    On the second disk we get the cream of the long-deleted complete Funhouse sessions box set.   The alternate takes are interesting and, if further proof was needed, confirm that the bad really were \\"in the zone\\" during these recording sessions.   However it is the sonic upgrade on disc one that justifies the purchase.  Rhino gernally do a great job on the remastering side but this is a huge leap from the previous cd version.  And thankfully, polishing the sound has not in any way tampered with the original feel of Funhouse.  A long overdue release and highly recommended to any rock fan (including Jack White).    <br />
B000002UA5|5.0|Well you found it here, on the live cd of the album, some of the best live performances you'll ever hear from any band. Pink Floyd live is always a treat thats why I love Live at Pompeii so much. The live disc contains 4 songs, all great songs. \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\" being my favorite of the bunch, great live and actually a little better then the studio version. Gilmours vocals at the end are amazing! gives me chills every time.<br /><br />The studio album Ummagumma is some of the darkest most psychedelic pieces of music you'll ever hear. Crank this album loud and be blown away by its oddness and strange beauty. Pink Floyd at their experimental best. Each band member got a section all to them self to write and do what they want. For most people this album may be way to strange to handle. I don't even smoke weed and this album rocks. I'm just a little weird like that. The poster that came with my album is stapled to my bedroom door, so when people see it they will know what they might expect, someone a little weird.<br /><br />Pink Floyd are amazing, no one can really top this band. I'm getting ever so close in owning everything they ever did. Ummagumma was a wonderful addition. It is just soo crazy and intense of an album! Richard Wrights songs are very nice, at times creepy and possibly the best on the album. Track 4 is very dark and plays out like a horror film scene or something. Roger Waters selections are my least favorite, \\"Small species...\\" is an insane song though. Gilmours part is quite nice and Mason gets a little crazy ending it with a nice short piece.<br /><br />Ummagumma is a must for a fan of the obscure music. It just doesn't really get any crazier then this.
B00005JNTX|1.0|Buyer beware--the director has already stated there is a expanded 'special edition' coming out in the future.  Do not buy this bare bones DVD if you are a fan of the movie and hate being ripped off by the movie studios!
B000002GYW|5.0|Hotel California eat your heart out. Ok, I really enjoy \\"Hotel California\\", but I have to say \\"Desperado\\" is the Eagles finest hour in their career. Starting off with \\"Doolin-Dalton\\" a beautiful piece of music. Hotel Califonia had it's self titled track which is a very good song, but is hailed as their best song, and because of that, it is overplayed. Then theres the very upbeat country tune \\"Twenty-One\\", which is what Eagles upbeat tunes should be all about, nice, twangy and fast paced. Hotel Californias \\"New Kid in Town\\" was never a favorite of mine, just something about the piano that didn't thrill me. Desperados \\"Out of Control\\" is a good rocker. \\"Tequila Sunrise\\" is classic Eagles. \\"Desperado\\" is a nice dark mellow tune everyone should know and love. Oh yeah its a \\"Certain Kind of Fool\\", great upbeat song. The Instrumental is quite nice and simple, a racap of \\"Doolin-Dalton\\". \\"Outlaw Man\\" is great rockin' song and sounds very much like a Neil Young song. \\"Saturday Night\\" is pretty good. \\"Bitter Creek\\" is one of the best songs on this album and better then most any song on Hotel California. The album reprise is a great ending to a great album. Early Eagles just had something that wasn't topped by their later albums like the somewhat overated Hotel California(Although Hotel California did have the awesome song \\"Victim of Love\\", my favorite on the album). Their sound was more fresh with Eagles and Desperado, like they weren't trying to hard to please people. Just great classic country rock the way it should be. Desperado is their best!
B0007MWZEK|2.0|I owned the Swivel Sweeper for 2 months before it broke.  I would have given it 4 - 5 stars before it broke but not anymore.  It does a great job of getting up all the visible dirt, hair, debris, etc. from hard surface flooring and floormats.  I have no carpet in my house so I cannot rate it on that.  It's easy enough to use that my 3-year old loves to help out.  The problem is that something in the gearbox must have broken because the motor makes noise but the brushes don't turn.  Because I am still in the 90-day warranty period, I was given the option of sending another $12.99 (handling fee) to have the unit replaced or return it for a refund of the $40 purchase price.  I haven't decided yet.  I've already spent ~$55 with the purchase price and ridiculous $15 S&H.  I'm not so sure I want to spend another $20 ($7 to send it to them and $13 handling charge) to get another one.  It's just a little too cheaply built.  I'd expect to pay $15 - $20 for the item at Target/Wal-mart.
B00001ZULV|2.0|If you are a fan of Genesis, pass on this greatest hits comp. <br /> <br />Abacab and Tonight are the \\"radio friendly versions\\". The mix for Mama is way off from the rest. Very little Peter G. featured. <br /> <br />The new remixes of classic tunes are lame.
0312958455|5.0|Hollywood Homicide Detective Harry Bosch is back in this forth installment in his series. Bosch remains the same - angry, bitter, and with an enormous sense of duty -, yet Connelly, a very skillfull and resourceful author, is able to complement and further develop his main character based on hints he scattered in the previous books.<br /><br />This time Bosch, suspended from his activities, will devote his spare time to investigate a murder that has haunted him for the past thirty years: the murder of his own mother. Connelly is able to weave a plot that began forty years earlier, involving prostitution, politics and struggle for power, and at the same time we, the readers, are able to get to know Bosch a little more: what was his infancy like, and what drives him today.<br /><br />\\"The last coyote\\" is the best book so far in the Harry Bosch series. Connelly has improved - not quite overcome, but surely improved - his \\"final twist\\" problem, giving the story more authenticity, and the plot is surely great.<br /><br />For those who think that \\"detective stories\\" are a lesser kind of literature, I always recommend Michael Connelly and Dennis Lehane. They are great authors, with excellent characters and their books present settings (Los Angeles and Boston, respectivelly) that feel real to the reader. No make-up, just the real deal.<br /><br />Grade 9.3/10
B0009SOFFY|5.0|Never mind the Mars probe: one listen to Fun House provides all the evidence you need to know that life exists elsewhere in the universe and that it visits the Earth from time to time. This album was so far ahead of its time and so at odds with virtually everything else being done by The Stooges' contemporaries - at least in rock music - that the only possible conclusion is that it was produced by aliens. The reason this album, together with its belated (1973) successor Raw Power, were so influential (and so magnificent) is that they quite simply redefined the limits of rock and roll. No band since has even looked like taking the music beyond this point, established in 1970. That's also why, after hearing this album, most bands today sound old and clichd and The Stooges sound brand new. I really hope Iggy and the band finally get the credit they deserve as true greats.
6305212112|5.0|In my circle of friends and family Fried Green Tomatoes, Steel Magnolias, and Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood are the three movies that we can go to any day of the week and get what we need from viewing it.

B00005JNTX|1.0|the 2 disc (and better version) is coming in december.  save your money.
B00005JNTX|4.0|This is easily the most stylish film to come out since \\"The Matrix.\\"  The look of the movie uses the same experimental technique I first saw in a Francis Ford Coppola film called \\"Rumble Fish\\" where the entire movie is shot in black and white with certain parts of each scene colorized for stark contrast.  This idea was later polished and brought to the mainstream in the film \\"Pleasantville.\\"  Since this film is based on a Noirish comic book the mixture of extreme black and white lighting with the colorful highlights makes for a fine visual experience.  As for the cast, most of the actors turn in good performances; the most notable being those of Mickey Rourke and a remarkable cameleon-like transformation from Benicio Del Toro.  The female characters are primarily two-dimensional buxom babes with little depth of emotion, but this film is based on a comic book for young men, after all.  There are a couple of forgettable performances given by Clive Owen and Michael Madsen.  Clive Owen's work here is wooden, and Michael Madsen is plain petrified and uninspired.  I kept having the feeling that Michael Madsen joined the project in the hopes of snaring Mickey Rourke's role, and when he didn't get it, severe apathy set in.  He was great in \\"Resevoir Dogs,\\" but this is by far and away the worst performance in any of his films that I've seen.  The storyline is another \\"Pulp Fiction\\"-like yarn with disjointed narrative that jumps back and forth between three violent and seemingly separate stories that cross paths at the end of the film.  The almost constant voice-over narration can be a burden on the generic movie-goer who wants more traditional film-fare, but it fits the style of this film perfectly.  There are some tedious moments, especially since this movie clocks in at over two hours, but the final result is an exciting experience with plenty to rave about and praise.  This film is destined for the Cult Classic section at your local video store.

B000002LK1|5.0|I'll start by telling you this is my favorite band of all time, so maybe this review is pure trash because I'm so madly in love with Depeche Mode -anyway, I don't really like Exciter, so I'm not the kind of sick fan that would defend his band no matter what they do.<br /><br />When Violator came out Depeche Mode was a very vital part of my life, and I wasn't that prepared for the new direction they were about to take. I had listened to Personal Jesus as the single came out something like 6 months prior to the release of the full album, and I was more than amazed by the dark and brutal sound of it. it was great. Then Violator hits the shelves and I had mixed reactions. 'Halo', 'Clean', 'Blue Dress' and 'Policy of Truth' were the first songs I fully embraced as my own, they were clearly Depeche Mode's own ground: dark, melancholic, and poppy at the same time, but 'Enjoy the Silence', 'World in my Eyes' and even 'Waiting for the Night' didn't rang the Depeche bell at first -to me, and I was 14 or 15 I guess.<br /><br />Now that I listen to the CD, everything's different. Violator is NOT Depeche Mode's masterpiece, that would be Black Celebration, but this is the moment they played all the right cards and encountered absolut victory.<br /><br />It may be due to the fact Flood was behind this, and he balanced every aspect of the Depeche distinctive sound -had he been around in the Black Celebration or Music for the Masses era, and those things would've been the closest thing to perfection.<br /><br />The thing that Violator lacks is strength in the lyrics. Don't get me wrong, 'Clean', 'Personal Jesus' and 'World in my Eyes' feature great lyrics, but there's nothing like 'Little 15's' exquisite innocence corruption, there's nothing like 'A Question of Lust's' naked sincerity, there's nothing like 'Never Let Me Down Again's' ambiguity.<br /><br />Violator is great and so damn classic, but it misses it's predecessors' lyrical marks. Anyway, it's a great start for any Depeche Mode newbie.
0743454537|5.0|I loved this book. The issues really made you think; you learn that both Anna and her parents love each other and love Kate, but they have slightly different priorities. I found the characters of the parents especially fascinating as they really DO care about both their daughters and want to do what's best for the family. You find yourself asking, what would I do in their posisition? How would I treat this situation? <br /> <br />The style of telling the book from different points of view is a great writing device to show this complex issue. The ending is...well, let's just say that I never have cried at the end of a book; this was probably the closest I've ever gotten though.

B0006L16N8|3.0|My friend Jerry said this album wasn't as good as another album he recently purchased. Well, I want to tell you that Jerry's as big a fool as you'll find in any comedy club in Sacramento. Clearly, this album can't stop vampires from attacking your family, but it WILL be played in your CD player (if you buy it and put it into your CD player and play it).  <br /> <br />The music features notes and rhythms, with all sorts of notes. There's a singer, and I can tell you from experience, music with a singer makes the lyrics come alive! <br /> <br />Also, if you don't know who X and Y are, this album might solve that mystery, with its powerful lyrics. If you had been in this band, you'd know that this album was recently released. Don't stop buying this, and make sure it's got the lyrics somewhere in your house! <br /> <br />Morley
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I am so glad I purchased this CD.  I absolutely love it.  I heard Michael's song, \\"Home\\" and couldn't wait to find the CD it was on.  He has a great voice and the songs he chose to represent on his recent CD was other favorites of ours as well. <br />Cheers!
B0007GAEGC|4.0|You know, I don't think there's a single woman alive who's dead. Knowing this as well as they (obviously) do, Celtic Woman has created a musical masterpiece that doesn't sound ANYTHING like dead women.  <br /> <br />By singing into microphones that sound as though they were plugged in at the time, the Celtic Women were really able to capture their unique sound. Their singing ability is surpassed only by their ability to surpass singing ability. <br /> <br />This is highly, lowly recommended!
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I think the majority of reviews here miss the point: This was never meant to be dissected 20 years on. It was meant to raise money in July 1985, then become nothing more than memory. Decisions made in haste then led to omissions now. But what is here is often electric. <br /> <br />Fortunately, at least some of the concert survived. More than perhaps was intended, and less than would be archived now. Despite the passion of the moment, watching the (now very young looking) Bob Geldof, the manic catylist behind this, it's easy to see how the intensity of the moment may have overswept the perspective and dicipline to document all of this event for posterity. <br /> <br />The carping about missing songs, and the lack of documentary backstage footage, etc. seems over critical to me. The DVD IS the documentary, it's just up to the viewer to add their (nostalgic?) thoughts to the event. It doesn't have a commentator speaking over it, but if you saw this event on TV back then, the feelings of that day will flood back unfiltered by time. This is more of a historical marker than a concert film, really. And to watch it is to melt back into 1985 for, as David Bowie puts it in one of the concert's highlight moments \\"...just for one day....\\" <br /> <br />The music, not to mention the film quality, is like the decade it sprang from: often erratic. A sampling of everything from the ridiculous (Thompson Twins and Madonna doing a Beatles cover? Honestly!) to the sublime. U2 were not icons they are now, but to see them in 1985 you can't be surprised at their metoric rise that lay just ahead, like an unpolished gem. But their day hadn't quite arrived yet.... <br /> <br />Seeing Queen again walk onto the stage at Wembly and unleash perhaps the greatest live music onslaught ever will give you chills. I'm not even a big fan of the group, but they not only stole the show, but single-handedly lifted the concert from significant to legendary in the span of 20 minutes. Seeing Freddie Mercuryso very alive that day, the irony of his passing in the context of all the suffering in Africa is almost too much to bear. <br /> <br />The scenes of the hungry in Africa are no less disturbing now as then, and the music is no less compelling either. Perfect DVD? No. The concert wasn't technically flawless, and despite the money raised didn't solve all the world's problems. This DVD is both thouroughly worthwhile but falls short of it's promise. Just like the concert that it captures so well. <br /> <br />No...this DVD isn't perfect, but it may be fitting that it isn't. For a decade often derided as superficial, for a moment the people of the world came together for something greater than themselves, and despite the flaws created something that still inspires awe.
B0002OERI0|1.0|What's wrong with you people? What's the deal with the dude who wrote his interpretation of the album? Half the paragraph doesn't even have any song titles!:  <br /> <br />\\"There's this guy (St. Jimmy), and he meets this chick (Extraordinary Girl), and they fall in love, but Jimmy has reservations because of things that have happened in the past and she sees through to his heart and knows he's a good and caring person, and then one time they move to the country,but the house they live in is haunted, and Jimmy discovers an ancient tome in his attic that tells of a conquistador graveyard underneath the house, so he sends for his uncle Grimey, who's a psychic, and they exorcise the demons, and then the girl moves away and he's sad (whatsernme).\\"  <br /> <br />Um... context? How about some? And what's with the guy who lists EVERY SONG ON THE ALBUM as \\"some of my favorites from the album\\"?!  <br /> <br />So, this album's not about the war? Did anyone READ the lyrics? How about the spoken-word segment of Holiday? Wake me up when SEPTEMBER ends? It's not over 'til you're underground? Seriously, are you people THAT stoned?  <br /> <br />Greenday sucks.
B000002AS3|4.0|Though not the second coming of the Fab Four, the talented brothers Gallagher built a strong career foundation with this well-made debut, featuring fan favorites \\"Rock N' Roll Star\\" and \\"Supersonic.\\" This album's songs, along with cuts from the superior follow-up (\\"What's The Story) Morning Glory?,\\" are still highly popular at concerts a decade later.  <br />\\"Definitely Maybe\\" is well worth the investment for both true-blue and sometimes Oasis fans.
B000AA4LAK|5.0|Hot Fuss is now a bona fide classic.  With it's  melodic rock base and new wave edge, this quartet have made QUITE a name for themselves.  So what can they possibly do to outdo their amazing album? <br /> <br />Throw in some more. <br /> <br />It's a bit early to release a new album, so they added 3 previously unreleased tracks.  Tack that on to the simply AMAZING debut they already have, and this is a no brainer. <br /> <br />But why should YOU, the discerning buyer, spend your money on this?  Especially if you already have their debut?  I'll tell you. <br /> <br />1.  Glamorous Indie Rock & Roll - This is an emotional song for them, I guess.  The lyrics are very interesting, and the music is entertaining and fun.  After the sadness that is \\"Everything Will Be Alright\\" (the previous ending song), this song is quite welcome.  Second best of the new songs. <br /> <br />2.  The Ballad of Michael Valentine - This is a fun bluesy new edge rock song.  Mellow, calming, save for Brandon Flower's light vocals.  The lyrics are interesting, and the song is definitely not boring.  However, of the three new tracks, this is probably the worst.  Not the worst song on the album, though. <br /> <br />3.  Under The Gun - It's possible they released this set as a limited edition simply to release this gem as a single, but I cannot be sure.  This could really be the \\"next\\" Mr. Brightside.  I find this song truly exciting and I really anticipate it's future in fans' hearts.  This is by far the best of the new songs, and to be honest, the best reason to pick this up. <br /> <br />If you LOVED Hot Fuss like I LOVED Hot Fuss, you are doing yourself a disservice by not purchasing this disc.  This belongs on your shelves, nustled gently next to the worn case of the original debut.  These additions make for a wonderful, thorough, full listen in ways that the regular edition never could. <br /> <br />Get it.  Now.  Before I continue talking about it.
0679735909|5.0|I bought this book because I loved the movie, and wanted all the missing pieces.  What a lovely read this is! I am so impressed with the poetry, the gorgeous writing, the depth of character and the lush background.  I finished it, and began immediately to read it again.  Ms. Byatt is a wonderful writer, I'm excited to have discovered her, and to have another book to read after this one.  I just re-read it for the third time, and it gets better every time.  This is a treasure.
B00000HYXB|5.0|Blind Guardian definitely scored a big hit with fans of both the power metal genre and of Tolkien's brilliant masterpiece \\"The Silmarillion\\". The opening sequence, something that the band uses still for their live performances, thrusts you into Middle-Earth with such ferocity you'll be wanting to pump this bad boy through a surround sound system just to hear the glory of the battle as loud as possible. And speaking of glory, Andre Olbrich is at the top of his game with beautiful harmonies and epic melodies, many of which may have you dancing just as much as head banging! Combine this with Marcus Siepen's devistating rhythm guitar and you have a wonderful bastion of metallic fury on your hands. Thoman \\"the oman\\" is also on his \\"A\\" game, as the drums are ferocious! And who can forget Hansi Kursch's marvelous vocals? Certainly not I! Blind Guardian is definitely one of the best power metal outfits around today, and one of the most respected, therefore if you like your music fast and full of fantasy, look no further than \\"Nightfall in Middle-Earth, you will not be sorry, quietly it will creep in and change you all!!!!
0316172324|4.0|Even the staunchest critic of Malcolm Gladwell's \\"Blink\\" should readily admit that his writing style is clear, concise, and extraordinarily accessible.  While it is true that he focuses this literary effort upon only one core theme, (i.e., that our brains are capable of far more rapid clarity and raw computing power than we normally take advantage of), I find that the numerous and diverse real-life examples that Gladwell uses to illustrate this central theme provide considerable, and nuanced, food for thought.  Of these examples, I find that those illustrating how the use of \\"thin-slicing\\" or rapid cognition can lead us terribly astray are particularly intriguing and thought-provoking.   <br /> <br />The juxtaposition of good and bad results leads to healthy self-examination.  How is it possible that, in one example, the human mind can be trained to discern with astonishing accuracy (over 90%!)whether two spouses will remain married based upon a few emotional markers that are observed in the course of watching 15-minute videotaped segments of seemingly mundane arguments between spouses?  Yet, in other dramatic examples, how is it that seemingly infallible physical senses are so warped by biases that they are able to betray the brain's recognition of reality?  How are these same \\"thin-slicing\\" techniques as practiced by experienced police officers able to result in the senseless beating of Rodney King in one instance, and the tragic slaughter of unarmed Amadou Diallo in another?  How often in everyday decisionmaking are our brains betrayed by the background noise of miseducated prejudices, or by information overload?  What are the consequences of these failures for the world we live in today?  What are the possibilities for our future if we can learn to overcome these cognitive failures?   <br /> <br />Gladwell's greatest strength is in telling the stories; summarizing plausible scientific explanations and theories for the good, the bad, and the ugly of thin-slicing;and finally, in raising the \\"what if\\" possibilities for a world in which we consciously seek to minimize \\"the bad and the ugly\\" influences on our powers of rapid cognition while simultaneously embracing the enormous (and largely untapped) powers of discernment that are locked away in our collective grey matter. <br /> <br />Gladwell's greatest weakness in this work is that he barely scratches the surface in providing concrete solutions and strategies for taking our subconscious minds to a higher level of discernment.  We are left to guess about what we should do next to raise our thin-slicing batting average.  However, there is considerable merit in Gladwell's willingness and ability to illuminate the tough issues.  For this reason, I give this book four stars instead of five.  Perhaps a \\"how to\\" manual from Mr. Gladwell will be a worthy sequel.    <br /> <br />
0312979479|5.0|Arguably the best Agatha Christie book. Excellent plot, LOTS of murders (heh), perfect. You will read this book in less than a hour because you will really stick to it.<br /><br />Recommended not only to Agatha christie fans (who MUST have read it already) , but also to everybody else.
0553573403|5.0|Although this first volume of the series is a bit slow to start, just keep reading and you will find yourself in the midst of a sweeping tale filled with vivid characters and espionage galore.  The slight touch of the magic and the supernatural really adds to what is otherwise a realistic-type story.  Not only could I not put it down, I immediately ordered volumes two and three from Amazon.com before I hit the last 200 pages.  A superior read in every way, and perhaps will appeal to those who do not care for fantasy novels.  Enjoy this sumptuous feast!
0895260131|5.0|I thought for some time about this book.  How would I like to see a politically incorrect guide to Paganism?  Or even to Christianity, Buddhism or Judaism?  There are plenty of negative things one could say.  And some of them are indeed politically incorrect, even in today's society.  How would I like to be a Muslim and see my religion blasted away at like this?  What would my Muslim ancestors have thought of this book?<br /><br />For me, the key question is whether this book adds or subtracts to our understanding of Islam today.  And I think it adds to it, although I think it could have done a better job of it by being less one-sided.<br /><br />Spencer reminds us that Mohammed was a military leader and that he advocated war against non-Muslims.  Moreover, Islam today appears to be acting in a similar manner, with its leaders often advocating war.  The author says that it is a PC myth that \\"Islam is a religion of peace that has been hijacked by a few extremists.\\"  As Spencer says, there are some moderate Muslims who don't regard Islam as a religion of war.  But I think Spencer is making a good point here: nothing inherent in Islam is stopping Muslims from trying to convert or rule the whole world by force.<br /><br />There is a section on the Crusades which I do not entirely agree with.  But I think it makes the point that Islam was not just an innocent victim but an aggressor in much of this period.  And that in any case, there is no need for Christians to make additional and unilateral concessions to Islam on the basis of Crusades of long ago, especially when there are more recent jihads by the Muslims.<br /><br />This book is at its best when it points out that Islam has been (and still is) a religion of intolerance that oppresses women.  And that Islam clearly opposes what most of us would regard as human rights for all.  Spencer reminds us of Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which gives every human the right to freedom of thought, including the right to change his (or her) religion or belief.  Islam does not share this view.<br /><br />Now, what is to be done?  I think we need to separate the sheep from the goats here.  Those people who can't abide human rights for their neighbors are a problem.  They'll have to obey the laws of the nations they live in.  But let's see what Spencer's advice is.  And let's also see if it is Islamophobic.  Does it make unreasonable demands on Muslims, or attack law-abiding people as well as criminals?<br /><br />Well, no.  Spencer does want us to tell the truth about Muslim organizations in the United States.  Truth is always a good idea, and it certainly fits right in with separating the sheep from the goats.  He wants us to tie global foreign aid to Muslim countries to their treatment of non-Muslims.  That is certainly fair. He wants us to reconfigure our global alliances and friendships the same way: those who support jihad won't be our allies.  And we need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, a smart idea no matter who controls it.<br /><br />I feel that Spencer's recommendations are reasonable.  I think they would make life easier, not harder, for all Americans, including American Muslims.  And they would make it easier for us to isolate our enemies and discourage people from joining with them.or her) religion or belief.  Islam does not share this view.    Now, what is to be done?

B0009IW98O|5.0|This is a great album as all the reviewers have already said. There is not much I can add to what they have said, except that no one seems to remember that this CD and 3 others have been released before. They are Mongrel, Ramblin' Gamblin' Man, Seven, and Smokin' O.P's. They were out in '92 or '93. They went out of print pretty fast. I have these and the new version of S.O.P.'s. It definetly sounds better with the new remastering. \\"Back in '72\\" was listed in Ice Magazine for release on 8-16-05 but it didn't happen. Must have been pushed back. That album has never been released on CD, so it will be a welcome addition to my collection. Hopefully, the powers-that-be will see fit to re-release the others with the new remastered sound which is superior to the first go rounds. Also, I vaguely remember seeing \\"Noah\\" on vinyl years ago, but I don't recall much about it. I was really looking forward to the \\"Back in '72\\" CD. I found a good copy of it on vinyl a few months ago and transferred it to my computer which sounds o.k. My favorite is \\"Rosalie\\" which Thin Lizzy covered much to the original way Bob did it.  ....Heavy Music, Indeed!!
B000002UAF|5.0|USUALLY WHEN YOU SEE LOTS OF LIL' GIRLS GAZING AT THE BAND AND SINGING ALONG WORD FOR WORD WITH EVERY SONG YOU CAN LAY GUARANTEE THAT THE MUSIC SUCKS ...ESPECIALLY IF THE MUSIC IS FORM THE MID 80'S TO THE 90'S AND BEYOND INTO TODAY...WELL ALOT OF LITTLE GALS SANG ALONG TO THE BEATLES BACK IN THE DAY ...AND THE BEATLES DIDN'T SUCK ! I grew up with another \\"American Version Release\\" of this that did not have 'THINGS WE SAID TODAY','ANY TIME AT ALL', 'WHEN I GET HOME',the brutally out of place 'YOU CAN'T DO THAT', and the HELP/1965-like ''ILL BE BACK'..those songs ended up on confusing American releases called 'Second Album' and 'Something new\\"..or somethin' like that,...OFCOURSE THE REST OF THIS IS AWESOME...MAYBE NOT AS GOOD AS WITH/MEET THE BEATLES...once again the British and American copies are different and it is confusing indeed..ALOT OF GOOD STUFF HERE...I LOVE EARLY STUFF..AND AFTERMATH AND BETWEEN THE BUTTONS STONES TYPE STUFF TOO...BUY THIS !
B000AP04FG|5.0|The good news is that this movie really did not take all that long for a DVD release. I went to the theater with really high expectations, and I left more than satisfied. Me, being both a Brad Pitt AND Angelina Jolie fan, had to see this movie. I think their on-screen chemistry was flawless and the plot was absolutely hilarious. Definitely one of my favorite action/comedy movies.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A character driven series that is great fun to watch. Makes you wonder how they could have possibly cancelled it. Buy it now so you'll have time to watch it before the movie comes out (September 23, 2005).
B000ANVQAA|5.0|I remember seeing 'Titanic' in the theater when I was around 13 years old. To this day, I still find it to be one of the most remarkable movies I have ever seen. It truly is a classic of our time, and it's nice to see that it's finally being treated as one.
B000002LMM|5.0|This music is magical, misterious, perfect. Angelo Badalamenti is the best. No wonder David Lynch works with him in all his films.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Daron has taken over most of the lyrics in this one. I do not know if this is such a good idea or not, but I do say that I am increasing being addicted to this record. Favourites would be 5.Video/Radio,7. Voilent Pornography,10.Old School Hollywood and 11.Lost in Hollywood. Serj is still one of the best vocallists of this era in my opinion. His harmony with Daron is unreal. Makes me feel.......SURREAL!
1402547064|4.0|Wow! I should really give this book a 5 since it was my first experience with a recorded book and several books later, I am addicted. Because of work I often have to drive up and down the Keys. I have a decent car radio but still have to chase stations from east to west and vice versa and still can't always zero in on public radio or air america. And for some unknown reason, my CDs just don't do it for me on the road. But once Mma Precious started telling me her tale, very odd at first,the voice, the language, the story itself, I was hooked. But is Alexander McCall really a man? If so, where is this lover of intelligent, well-fed women who appreciate good mechanics?
B00007E8O5|5.0|From start to finish keeps the listener entertained and intrigued throughout both disks. I must admit Jerry certainly has gained more studio knowledge after \\"Boggy Depot\\". It certainly has shown his vocal talent since Alice In Chains departed. Brilliant record. Best Heavy/Grunge for quite awhile. Makes me feel like there is hope for music of this kind in this generation.
B00005YW4H|3.0|In all honesty, she can sing. She has a nice voice it just appears that she can't do much with it. This album has good music, but Norah Jones sings all of the songs the same. There's no feeling. Nothing changes but the lyrics and the music. I hope she's a more colorful individual than her style of singing. I tried to listen to this album again to get a better opinion of it. And it put me to sleep. I can only draw two conclusions from that. The first one the music is peaceful and Norah's voice is tranquil enough to cause me to go into a peaceful rest. Or because it's just boring. I think it's both.    ****Update****   I put this album in the cd player and asked my mom what she thought. She said it was good.  She said it is very tranquil but she supposes that it is her style. So I guess if my mom likes it then I do to, so I'll have to rank it up to a four star instead of the three. I found it interesting that the very reason that some people gave it five stars was the same reason that others gave it one. Because it's soft, silent, peaceful and has the ability to make you rest. So I guess it's all about what you are looking for. If you are looking for something upbeat and transitional then this is definitely not the album for you. But if you are looking for something serene and tranquil, Come Away With Me is your album and Norah Jones is your girl.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|THis is one of those movies that does not play it fair. What this kind of movie does? It's simple. It catches you attention by means of a clever and intelligent first act, then goes to unlimited plot twists and clever editing that makes your brain gets numb and you will feel that you are watching a great movie, that you are being entertained. Then, some minutes after the movie ends you suddenly ask yourself: \\"What the heck...?\\" The next affirmative is: \\"This is the new champion of plot holes\\". Then comes the sad conclusion: \\"What an awful movie! How could I be fooled this way?!\\" And then you will wnat your money back, but it's too late.
B000099T2L|3.0|When I listen to Beyonce I'm not listening for word's of wisdom like I do from Lauryn Hill or Erykah Badu, nor am I looking for a unique sound as I would when listening to Corine Bailey Rae. But what Beyonce does, she does well, she's a good entertainer who can get you going. This CD can get you going. I think Daddy is very nice tribute to her father and her collaboration with the late Luther Vandross was well done. I'd rather be with you is another fav of mines.
B00000811N|5.0|No, it doesn't sound like Pink Floyd - - but neither did 'Several Small Species Of Furry Animals Gathered Together In A Cave And Grooving With A Pict', another Waters/Geesin collaboration - - and yes, it really is music from the body.  Blame it on Geesin, blame it on Waters, but at least they recorded what you probably don't even want to acknowledge publicly.  Besides, it predates any other Floyd solo work by years.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I will echo many thorough and positive reviews before me about the movie. Interest is renewed again after doing some of the interactive exercises and previews on Disc 2. Makes you want to go back and watch the movie again.
B0000025DD|5.0|Yes, it sounds like Pink Floyd and no, the rest of the boys in the band are nowhere near.  What does that say about Gilmour's contributions to The Floyd?  A lot, I'd say.  Nice instrumentals, and the harmonica lends a perfectly swampy atmosphere to 'There's No Way Out Of Here'.  But there was a way, and here it is.
6301797906|5.0|This video was received in excellent condition and with quick service.  Awesome service!
B00005JNSK|5.0|When I first heard they were remaking this movie, I had no interest in it due to the fact that I thought the original was just fine.  But, being a fan of both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I was not disappointed, and neither were my children.  As a matter of fact, my family and I have seen it three times already.<br /><br />Just yesterday, ten of us went together to see it, our ages ranging from 4-54.  Everyone had a great time and I for one can say that this movie is not \\"too dark\\" for children, nor \\"boring\\" for adults.  It fit \\"just right\\" for us all, and I imagine it will continue to do so for most who watch it.<br /><br />My just turned four year old is of the belief that it is the best movie he's ever seen, I quote him here when the credits rolled: \\"I loved that movie\\" and then while getting into the car: \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory rocked!\\".<br /><br />My mother, at the age of 54, says she very much enjoyed the movie, more so then the original, and \\"will be buying it to add it to her DVD collection when it is available.\\"<br /><br />Johnny Depp is simply fabulous as Willy Wonka and the rest of the cast do not disappoint.  I actually found this version to be more like the book, and that is always a good thing in my opinion!  While it is true that the ending is different then both the book and the original film, the message that we're given at the end is timeless, and one that we often need to be reminded of in this day and age.  Family, and the love we have for each other is what matters the most in life, and worth more then all the chocolate in the world!
B0002OERI0|1.0|This album has way too much hype, it really isn't that good. I bought this album based upon all the great reviews I have been hearing; even though I couldn't stand to listen to any of the singles that were being over played on the radio. This has to be one of the most overrated pieces of garbage I have ever heard. It lacks everything that Dookie ever was, and from beginning to end is nothing but another bad pop album. I don't know what everyone is talking about I guess.
B000003C4K|4.0|BONDED BY BLOOD has to be one of Thrash Metal's most shining moments Following the footsteps of fellow peers METALLICA, EXODUS' debut album solidified the legendary \\"Bay Area Sound\\", with its galloping riffing, fast drumming and more-evil-than-satan lyrics. EXOUDS was also among the very first thrash bands (along with METALLICA) to incorporate \\"neo classical\\" elements into their lead guitar work. Guitarist Rick Hunolt and Gary Holt were THE thrash metal Guitar team of the decade, much like thrash's equivalent of a K.K.Dowining and Glenn Tipton. Both played with such a knack for melody and precision that it became one of their trademarks. Paul Baloff's voice set a new standard in vocal violence. He is truly missed (he died a couple of years ago). The drum work of Tom Hunting far and excelled that of a famous dane in another metal band! Tom was truly great on this album. And the songs? They are fast, a bit silly lyric-wise, but most important: MEMORABLE. The songs, no matter how violent the performance, always remained catchy. \\"Bonded By Blood\\" starts this CD off with what sounds like an airplane about to hit the ground and then explodes into thrash metal mayhem with a very crunchy rhythm. \\"Lesson In Violence\\" never lets the pace down and even pushes the band further into thrash glory. \\"Piranha\\" is also a great number. This song became one of their live staples and was popular due to the \\"Ultimae Revenge\\" video (with SLAYER and VENOM) which included an outstanding performance by the band. <br />\\"Strike Of The Beast\\" closes the album with a blast and gives SLAYER a run for their money. Easily one of the most technically proficient bands of the era. It's sad they never got the success they richly deserve and over the course of the years they refused to branch out of their \\"only thrash\\" mould which cost them dearly. <br /> <br />Now, I can't give this particular edidtion of BONDED BY BLOOD a 5 star rating simply because the cover and artwork is beyond atrotious. I am positively sure the band HATES this edition and I truly hope they plan to release this album with THE original cover and artwork. Shame on Combat records for doing this fly-by-night edition to make a quick buck on hungry fans. Even the 2 live extra songs are out of context since it's NOT Paul Baloff singing but Zetro Sauza, the bands' current singer. I suggest other fans to look elsewhere for this thrash classic. If you're into newer bands like SHADOWS FALL and THE HAUNTED then you will DEFINITELY eat this album up. Just don't buy this truly horrendous edition!

This story will make you think twice about nature and how you live your life.
0792839749|5.0|I recently took my four year old son to see Chitty Chitty Bang Bang on Broadway and he absolutly loved it. It was so much fun seeing the play that I bought the original movie so we could watch it over and over. Dick Van Dyke is funny and perfect for the part. More movies should be like this today.
B00005JNZ4|5.0|Diane Lane and John Cusak were great in this movie. I thought it was a very cute romantic comedy and I am so looking forward to when it comes out on DVD. This movie is a must see for any girls night out or in!
0385338686|5.0|And yet again Sophie Kinsella hits another one straight to my heart!  I have totally enjoyed her 5 previous novels.    This time out, we meet, become astounded at, even horrified by, Samantha Sweeting, contract attorney extraordinaire.  She is blasting her way to partnership and has lost any resemblance of a life.  But it's ok, it'll get better once she's made partner.  And besides, it's what she's wanted since she was 12.  But then oops, she makes an astronomically costly & stupid mistake, temporarily loses her mind and ends up taking a job, for just the night, she thinks, as a housekeeper.  She'll sort everything out in the morning.  But then things keep coming up and she can't bring herself to tell her new bosses, who are endearing themselves to her with their quirks and qualms, that she's never been a housekeeper, hasn't a clue how to operate an iron, never mind the washing machine, she never trained under Michel de la Roux de la Blanc, who isn't even a chef, and really, she's been trained at all the top schools as an ATTORNEY!    This book hit all the right notes in all the right places for me.  It is pure escapist pleasure and satisfaction through and through.  Samantha is hysterical.  Nat is the complete package - smart, talented, funny, really good to his mom and totally hot!  He's a landscaper for god's sake - tan & deliriously muscled!  Trish and Eddie are at turns adorable and irritatingly small minded.  They haven't a clue.  But you end up liking them all the same.    If you've liked Sophie Kinsella's other novels, I guarantee you will enjoy \\"The Undomestic Goddess\\".  You will want to see how Samantha ends up straightening out her shambles of a life.  And you will be laughing out loud quite a lot of the time.  I was so sad when the book ended.  Just like I have felt with all her novels, I hope and hope and hope Sophie will continue Samantha's story in a sequel.      Please, I want more of Samantha!

B00000J2PH|4.0|This record brings together all the original hits of <br />  Carol King on one CD. It is well made and contibutes to a <br />  sense of nostalgia for 30-35 years ago.
B00005JNTX|4.0|What an ungainly piece of celluloid this is. What a misanthropic, brutal, soulless wreck. What a relentlessly gruesome, amoral, soul-deadening slice of grindhouse pulp.     And yet, what fun it is to look at, and how entertaining and involving it becomes.    \\"Sin City\\" is a perfect example of the kind of film where the talents at work totally overwhelm the subject matter, resulting in a work of art that is much better than it needs to be but is ultimately chained down by the nature of its content. Director Robert Rodriguez, guest director Quentin Tarantino, and a splendid cast of not simply big names but iconic ones squeeze every inch of mileage they can get out of what amount to three stories that really only exist to string along scenes of ever-mounting, sadistic violence that is so shocking that I can't believe it can pass for mainstream entertainment. Simply put, the R-rating for this film is a joke-- even Takashi Miike's \\"Audition,\\" Gasper Noe's \\"Irreversible,\\" Scorcese's \\"Casino,\\" and Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" don't match \\"Sin City\\" for sheer brutality. Forget about \\"Kill Bill\\"; it's not even in the same category.    And yet, somehow, the sheer momentum and energy carries the viewer through. Every image oozes style and cool, and the atmosphere is so thoroughly badass that you end up getting swept away despite yourself. Never mind that (SPOILER) the only characters with any moral fiber whatsoever end up dead (END SPOILER). Never mind that the women are either sluts or hookers and the men are murderers and villains. Never mind that there's not an ounce of value that emerges from \\"Sin City\\"'s barrage of ugly cynicism. If you watch this film, you will be unable to take your eyes from it. That's some achievement, given what actually happens on screen. Heck, this movie even survives relentlessly bad performances by its two key female leads; the beautiful, talented Rosario Dawson dons a sexy outfit, but hams it up a little too much; and the significantly less beautiful, less talented actress whom I know only as \\"that irritating bitch from the \\"Gilmore Girls\\" and who singlehandedly undermines the movie's credibility whenever she steps on screen.     Also, I've got to admit that I've got a certain amount of love for any action movie that earns its R rating in this era of neutered, PG-13 rated flicks where the trailers are more sexy and violent than the actual films. I'll take \\"Sin City\\" and \\"Bad Boys II,\\" flawed though they may be, over \\"The Bourne Supremecy\\" any day of the week.    Still, in spite of what's been accomplished here as far as pure filmmaking goes, you can't help but wonder what the people involved in this project could have done with a more imaginative, if equally pulpy, set of stories.
B00004TVGF|5.0|I am neither a connoisseur of baroque music nor an expert in music in general, but I base my review on an comparison between this versions and others ; take for instance Harnoncourt's (Teldec, Das alte Werk, 1994). <br />In one word : both interpretations are coherent. Harnoncourt : rich women voices with a lot of vibrato and contrast, the soprano often at full power ; loud orchestra. Jacobs : cristalline and precise male voices, especially the boy Henning's (more at ease in the heights than woman sopranos are), few effects, orchestra in the background, microphone close to the singers. The tempi are quicker, whereas Harnoncourt uses slower ones to make place for variations in intensity and manner. <br />I don't know which one is truer to the score or to its spirit, but it seems to me that Jacobs' leads as regards both musical quality and emotion conveyed.

B000065PUE|5.0|The Pixies were one of the greatest bands of the 80s, and this album shows why perfectly. Only Sonic Youth and Pavement can come close to them for indie rock briliance. This is true indie, none of that lame Bright Eyes stuff that kids are getting into nowadays. The guitar work and lyrics are briliant, perfectly showcasing the band's knack for combining surrealistic lyrics with catchy pop tunes. While I probably prefer \\"Surfer Rosa\\" by a little bit, I feel this album shows the Pixies range better. There is cathy pop-rock (\\"There Goes Your Man\\"), abrasive post-punk (\\"Tame\\", \\"There Goes My Gun\\"), and jangle pop (\\"La La Love You\\"). This is definatly the place to start with the Pixies, as their debut is more noisy and abrasive. As many have noted, this is one of the most influential bands of the 80s. The Pixies basically paved the way for the mainstream Grunge / Alt explosion in the early 90s that Nirvana started. Kurt Cobain would have been very different if it wasn't for Black Francis. If you find yourself enjoying this, pick up every other album the Pixies did, trust me you won't regret it.
0375757422|5.0|Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder.<br /><br />Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled. Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings.<br /><br />Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet, wrongly, that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her.<br /><br />Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.<br /><br />Love and the formal protocol or marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults.<br /><br />Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

B00003CXHJ|5.0|An intense action drama with a well built story.  Tremendous attention to detail and even though it is not a true story it is very believable and engrossing.  This is more of a story that \\"could have happened\\" and is based on a mixture of historically true circumstances rearranged with artistic license.  Watch this one in surround sound with the lights out and you will be under the Atlantic surrounded by depth charges.
0060751967|5.0|Roman Dragonesti is a vampire with a problem.  He's lost his right fang in possibly the most embarrassing manner there is and there are no vampire dentists.  If he doesn't get his fang back in by dawn, he'll go through the rest of his life a one-sided eater.  <br /> <br />Shanna is a dentist working the late-night shift in an emergecy clinic because she can't stand the sight of blood.  She's also trying to hide out from the folks who made her frightened---who coincidentally will kill her if they find her... <br /> <br />Of course, Roman has to come to her clinic the night Shanna's pursuers catch up.  Can he save her?  Can she get his fang back in on time?  Can this mis-matched pair find true happiness?  <br /> <br />I haven't laughed so hard in years.  \\"How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire\\" is just as funny as any of the Stephanie Plum (Janet Evanovich) novels and early Anita Blake (Laurell K. Hamilton).  The author has a way of writing a hook at the end of each chapter that makes you hold your breath til you can turn over the next page!
B00005JNTX|1.0|I really wanted to get this dvd but was alarmed to see the only 'extra' on the disc is a lousy featurette, I mean these sort of discs were made 5 years ago not now. When I read about a multi-disc version coming in a few months time it just goes to show how greedy the movie studios are and they will continue to do this unlesss gullible, impatient sheep stop buying these plain discs and demand and wait for the proper full version. <br /> It wouldnt be so bad if they made a load of extras now and then released the later one with different extras and more scenes so at least you would have 2 different versions. Also does anyone know if the later discs will include extra/deleted/extended scenes? Better yet why couldnt they release just one, full, definitive version like the star wars trilogy? Just be patient guys and resist the temptation!
B00005JL78|4.0|In the future, murders have run rampant, spilt blood seeping right over the vacillating thin-blue-line. Many have lost loved ones and never get a sense of closure nor the sense of peace provided by the exercise of justice. The chief of the experimental pre-crime unit, John Anderton, never questions the ethics of keeping three mentally handicapped \\"pre-cogs\\" captive to utilize their abilities to foresee and prevent would-be murders; as far as anyone knows, there are no flaws in the system--with the system in place, every murder in Washington D.C. has been averted. He never questions whether or not would-be murderers could possibly change their own destiny. He doesn't quesion at all, until his own people attempt to arrest him for the vision of Anderton killing a mysterious man called Crow. People's impression of this movie is so varied one from another that it is nearly impossible to draw any conclusions from anyone's review. What most people are here to determine is whether or not they want to buy this movie. If you've already seen it and liked it, I guarantee you won't regret buying it. It is worth watching multiple times. If you've seen it and weren't too enthusiastic about it, try watching it again. You might change your mind, as your expectations of it are more realistic: it's not a popcorn thriller. It doesn't manipulate people with movie cliches nor is it filled with superfuous special effects put there primarily to excite people their first time watching. Instead we have something profoundly disturbing, moving and edifying all in one package. The themes are profound: predestination, the conflict of principle vs. uility, loss and healing. There is art, imagery and imagination and--as would be expected--it's impossible to ignore Cruise's earnest portrayal of the instensely conflicted protagonist. For many people, Minority Report belongs on the shelf next to their most prized DVD's.

B000002A3T|5.0|Pink Floyd's reputation, at least in the post Roger Waters years, has been built on dramatic live shows. The Division Bell offers some of Floyd's best studio work in recent years and certainly provided a forum to develop some new music for the band to take on the road.<br /><br />David Gilmore's guitar work continues to be first-rate and easily recognizeable. His subtle strums have become his signature, much in the same way a few chords from Clapton and Townsend can be attributed to their authors.
0440237688|5.0|Eleven-year-old Jonas lives in a community where all decisions are made for you--your career, your spouse, and even your children. Everything is meticulously ordered, the choices so carefully made. Once you begin to have wants and desires, you're required to take a pill to suppress them. There are no deep feelings, no real sense of right and wrong, and love is meaningless and useless. The Elders control everything and keep everyone happy, healthy, and ignorant, as they are themselves ignorant and must look to The Giver--the person who knows all--for wisdom.<br /><br />When Jonas reaches the age of twelve, he's assigned a career based on what he did as a volunteer. Instead of being excited, Jonas is apprehensive about the upcoming ceremony-with good reason. He's selected as The Receiver, a very honorable position, and he must meet with The Giver every day after school to receive the memories of pain, war, destruction, happiness, and love--the memories of man from way back.<br /><br />The more Jonas learns, the more outraged he becomes. He wants to make his own choices, and he believes everyone should be able to choose what color of tunic they'd like to wear each day, but The Giver quickly tells him there are more complicated choices, and it's safer to protect people from making wrong choices when they're at the age when choices become important.<br /><br />Jonas learns that, yes, there is the pain of hunger, death, war, and cruelty, but there's also the happiness of birthday parties, holidays, spring rains, blue skies and sailing, horseback riding, and hugs and laughter. He learns that everyone should be able to experience making choices.<br /><br />Even though this novel was written for teens, I truly enjoyed it from beginning to end. Several conflicting emotions surged through me as I read \\"The Giver\\"--at first it was anger that anyone could conceive of such a place, but mostly I was confused because I couldn't decide if the community Jonas lived in was truly a good thing. Part of me thought it was. People do tend to make stupid choices and mess up not only their own lives but also the lives of those around them. But the emotional side of me kept screaming, It's wrong! All wrong! Because I had the gift of wisdom, the knowledge of right and wrong, and an array of emotions, I couldn't agree with such a community. In the end I had to agree with Jonas and The Giver. No one should have the freedom of choice taken from them.<br /><br />At the end of the book, you, the reader, are left to determine what fate you think Jonas saw. Yours will probably be different from mine, depending on your optimism. I like to think...well, I wouldn't want to influence your thinking. Everyone should read \\"The Giver\\". It's a powerful, thought-provoking story.truly a good thing. Part of me thought it was.

B000053VBL|4.0|This is an intriguing film. There are a lot of odd choices in it that make it distinctive. It's in lush color, uniformly brightly lit. The fashions are dramatic, and for Moreau, mostly variations on black or white. Which is fitting, as she's an avenging angel, acting on a moral imperative.<br /><br />Though, to her victims, she's a femme fatale, the film interestingly does not demonize her. As the story unfolds, we learn her reasoning, and she is insanely dedicated to efficiently targeting her victims. She doesn't allow for innocents to get caught in the crossfire.<br /><br />Perhaps most interesting of all is Moreau's performance; she rarely smiles, in fact underplays every scene. So we're left with the beautiful enigmatic presence of a woman acting as she must, by her own moral reckoning, alienated from the rules and constraints of society. One minute of confession finally lets us in to the pain under her stony visage; yet even that is intercut with flashbacks and underlined by Hermann's expressive score.<br /><br />Truffaut's Hitchcock homage works on several levels, not least of which is each of the varied guises the bride wears to snare her foes. She makes herself into their perfect object before killing them, and they make it all to easy for her. And yet each encounter is distinct, a portrait of the character of the man who wronged her as much as of Julie herself.<br /><br />Most unusual of all, perhaps due to the Hitchcock influence, is how old-fashioned the movie is. The narrative is so direct, so visual and so well-plotted, there's none of the verite' or hand-held moves that were making other films look natural and experimental at the time. The look is more 1960 or 1964 than 1968; it must have looked old-fashioned even at the time. And yet Moreau's Julie, in costume after costume, is an indelible vision.<br /><br />There are few extras on the DVD, just scene selections and the theatrical trailer, which is a kitschy treat.
B0009S4IHY|3.0|I watched the movie and didn't find it very funny. There was some humor but nothing stood out as being overly funny. No belly laughs here!
B00005NTN5|5.0|I rented this movie long ago, not having a clue what it was about (best way to watch a film), and it blew me away.  The style and direction is amazing.  It's not for everyone... for example, I raved about it to my brother, he saw it, and said I have weird taste in film (this is no romantic-comedy-type movie!). <br /> <br />The two lead females were so sexy together that it practically made me want to turn into a lesbian.  But the best part was that when the action started, on top of all the suspense and action, you didn't know if the two woman were just using each other or really cared for each other.   <br /> <br />This is a good film for people open to movies with violence, like if you were a fan of Pulp Fiction.  It's a very smart film.   <br /> <br />Another great movie that not a lot of people have heard about that was on Siskle and Ebert's top 10 list one year (I believe in the #1 spot) is One False Move-- a great film!
B00028HBKM|5.0|The Passion of the Christ is one of the most intense movies I have ever seen. After reading up on the events of Jesus' last twelve hours as well as commentary from respected sources like Pope John Paul, I watched this film with an eye on the historical details as Mel Gibson presented them.<br /><br />It is true that the scenes involving the whippings and the crucifixion are extremely brutal and disturbing. But one of Gibson's purposes in making this movie was to demonstrate how Jesus suffered at the hands of the Roman guards. The newspaper critics who smugly wrote this off as if it were one more sadistic Hollywood bloodbath miss the point that anyone can produce a blood-gore-and-guts film, but very few can make it relevant in a historical perspective.<br /><br />Another interesting feature of The Passion is the fact that the majority of the dialogue is in Aramaic, and in the case of the Romans, Latin. I was surprised to recognize at the beginning of the film the words of one of the \\"4 questions\\" that we ask at the Jewish Passover meal called Seder: \\"Why is this night different than all other nights?\\"<br /><br />If there is any criticism it is that from time-to-time Gibson transitions from one scene to the next almost too quickly, and it's not always easy to keep track of who's who or what they're doing. This aside, the scenery and acting are top-notch and the story is engaging even though you know the ending.<br /><br />One additional item I was curious about was the charge of anti-Semitism, especially regarding the representation of the role of the Hebrew priests in Pilate's decision to crucify Jesus. Personally I think this charge was a lot of nonsense coming from people who tend to run their mouths too much. The facts are that Jesus was challenging the corrupt temple hierarchy, and the Hebrew priests' motivations were largely political, e.g., getting rid of a potential threat. During the movie I really didn't see how anyone could interpret this differently, unless you were looking for a reason to do so.<br /><br />The Passion of the Christ is well worth watching and I strongly recommend it. But be prepared, because there's no doubt about the fact that some of the scenes are very rough.y, unless you were looking for a reason to do so. <br /> <br />The Passion of the Christ is well worth watching and I strongly recommend it.

037571457X|5.0|This graphic novel is incredible both in the language and in the art.  The story of a young girl struggling to live in Iran comes across amazingly clear. I would recommend the novel to young adults and over despite the age of the character.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|Well I rented this movie because a co-worker told me how hilarious it was.  There were a couple of scenes that made me crack a smile and chuckle a bit, and I did like the dance scene at the end and the way the movie ended was good, but otherwise, I basically sat there straight-faced the entire movie, constantly glancing at the \\"time-elapsed\\" clock on my dvd player, counting down the time that was left in the movie because I couldn't wait to get done watching it and take it back to the video store.  This movie is just boring, plotless, and isn't very funny at all, save a couple small laughs here and there.  And yes, I \\"get\\" the humor, it just didn't work for me.
B00005UKKF|5.0|HBO did an awesome job showing the concert on TV.  As for the show, the only songs I really didnt like was 'Stronger' (which is my favorite song by Britney), 'Dont Let Me Be The Last to Know' because she sounded awful, and as for the DVD version dubbing her voice on 'Baby One More Time'.  Personally, I thought she sounded great live.  They also took some of her ab-libs and moaning out during 'Slave'.  But Overall, it was still great to watch

0792844890|3.0|I saw this film and the original STAR WARS film in the theaters when they were first released.  Mel Brooks became a favorite of mine.  This was a family movie night selection.  My boy loved it. <br /> <br />SPACEBALLS has tons of sight gags and name-game jokes.  There is also plenty of just-plain silliness that I would  expect from Mel Brooks.  Bill Pullman as the Han Solo parody and John Candy, complete with dog ears and tail, as his sidekick are fun together.  Mel Brooks appears as Yogurt, the wise and colorful.  Rick Moranis as a slightly shorter, but enormously helmeted version of Darth Vadar was my favorite. <br /> <br />Although this film is not quite YOUNG FRANKENSTIEN or BLAZING SADDLES, it is a great way to spend an evening with the kids.   <br /> <br />I'm told they would have given it a 4-star rating. <br />

B000AU9UYM|5.0|This is, hands down, the finest movie I have seen in years.  To compare it to other *good* films in recent memory, it has the visual depth of Harry Potter 3, twice the emotional resonance of Spidey 2, and enough total satisfaction to have me seriously consider burning my Batman DVD collection of the Burton/Schumaker films in effigy. <br /> <br />I remember all of the hype leading up to Batman in '89, only to leave the theater feeling disappointed in a movie that had less to do with the title character and more to do with his arch-enemy.  When it came out on video, the AV place where I worked kept it in the VCR 24/7, and I quickly realized how annoying the movie became in the second hour with Vicky Vale's incessant screaming (this from a woman who supposedly photographed smouldering bodies on the front lines of war). I remember hating Batman Returns upon its release, only to gain some respect for it over the years as I've grown to appreciate Tim Burton's visual style.  And with the revolving door around the man in the cape and cowl, I watched the franchise ultimately descend to B&R, the biggest pile of garbage in recent movie history, hated more than Battlefield Earth because it ruined characters that we were already connected to. <br /> <br />In a rare move of genius, the WB suits allowed the filmmakers to  reboot the whole franchise with this film.  The result is a film that isn't bound to established rules.  It stands on its own and shines in its darkness. <br /> <br />Batman Begins ranks with Superman: The Movie as the greatest comic adaptation of all time.  But it transcends being a comic adaptation.  It's a stellar movie all on its own. <br /> <br />Hans Zimmer's is simple, riviting, emotional. A score can make or break a film, and Zimmer once again does not disappoint.  It underscores how weak Danny Elfman's Spider-Man scores are, and it even eclipses Elfman's Batman scores.  Accomplishing what Elfman can never seem to do, it heightens the tension and manipulates the audience's emotions, invoking the proper emotion for each scene. <br /> <br />Nolan is more than an auteur -- he is an artist, and this will be the pivotal moment in his career, much as Jaws was for Spielberg. The press leading up to this film noted that Nolan effortlessly pulled the whole thing together, turning in the film on time and on budget, as though already he had years of experience directing big budget epics. Clearly his confidence and lack of pretentiousness allowed the actors to deliver pitch-perfect performances. If the cast isn't strained, that comes through in a film. <br /> <br />Christian Bale plays Bruce Wayne in a fresh way, with a youthful vigor that the \\"older\\" character hasn't shown, and yet much darker and scarier.  This is the Batman you don't want to meet in a dark alley. <br /> <br />The supporting cast is rife with talent whose names preceed them -- but this has been true of every Bat-film.  What makes this cast stand out from the films of the past is that they have checked their egos at the door, and clearly showed up to act.  None of the performances are phoned-in here. <br /> <br />Regarding Katie Holmes, as one who never watched an episode of Dawson's Creek or any of her previous films, I was able to judge her performance in this film quite objectively.  She rose to the challenge of her more seasoned costars, delivering an excellent performance that hopefully will result in her character's return in future films.  Having a female interest who returns in a Batman film is a chance for Bruce Wayne to truly develop emotionally.  And it can even lead to the catalyst for the much-wanted Batman vs. Superman.  But let's not get ahead of ourselves. <br /> <br />I reiterate, this is the finest movie, end to end, that I've seen a long while.  We have come to accept mediocrity in small and large doses in recent cinema, but I experienced not a single cringeworthy moment in the entire film.  Not one.  I have not been so throroughly entertained at the movies in years.  The Matrix sequels, The Harry Potter movies, Lord of the Rings, the X-men movies, the Spider-Man movies ... these are all films that I've loved in this decade and watched again and again. But Batman Begins blew them all away for me. If those movies were home runs in their own right, Batman Begins is a grand slam.
B0002IQHY8|1.0|Absolute techno crap. This is just electronic dribble with no emotion or feeling; obviously released ONLY for commercial purposes. There is no concept here, the bass is overblown.

B000002JSN|4.0|Physical Graffiti may have been the turning point in Led Zeppelin's career.  Their early efforts - 1 & 2 - were marked by heavy, blues-based grooves that kept things relatively simple.  3 was a departure from that formula, as it saw a whole side dedicated to acoustic-based material that worked rather nicely as an addition to the Zep pantheon.  ZOSO and Houses of the Holy, meanwhile, combined these two sensibilites with increased ambition to make for the legendary Zep catalog that most people hear on the radio even today, with songs like Black Dog, Rock and Roll, Stairway to Heaven, Over the Hills and Far Away, Dyer Maker, and The Ocean.  Physical Graffiti, as the long-awaited follow-up to Houses of the Holy, brought massive expectations.  Fans ate it up, but today some of its genius must be questioned. <br /> <br />Albums of the 60's and 70's were noticeably different from records of today in several aesthetics.  One was that the running time was far shorter than today's 60-75 minute average.  40-50 minutes was the norm back then, and on Zep's first few albums, they stuck to the norm.  Having less material on a record often makes each individual song more meaningful and increases its impact tremendously.  If taken on its own merits, disc 1 of Physical Graffiti holds up to this claim very well.  It contains 6 songs, for a running time of near 50 minutes, and the impact each has is crushing.  True, there is no acoustic-based material on the first disc, but the way Zep evolved blues into a harder, more rocking style is on full display.  In my opinion, Page's finest guitar work takes place on this first disc, as he unleashes tasty rhythm parts and scorching solos especially on the epic blues numbers \\"The Rover\\" and the 10+-minute \\"In My Time of Dying\\".  Zep was never louder or swaggered more than on these 6 timeless cuts.  One of their most enduring tunes, \\"Kashmir\\", rounds out the disc, for a final hammer blow few back in '75 could have ever anticipated. <br /> <br />On to disc 2, then.  Robert Plant himself proclaimed that about 50 percent of the material on Physical Graffiti was not completely new, and showcased much of the more playful side of Zeppelin (the less focused side, as it turns out).  (This interview can be found on the Led Zeppelin DVD, the one with the giant rock cliff, blue sky, and desert on the cover.)  Plant was certainly right in that much of this material was less focused; only \\"Ten Years Gone\\" and \\"Sick Again\\" have the focus and raw power of the rest of the immortal Zeppelin songbook.  Most of the material on disc 2 is of a lighter variety, some of it acoustic, some of it not.  But, to put it simply, the songs on disc 2 are not very good.  Do they show another side of Zeppelin?  Yes.  Are they in any way refreshing to hear?  Somewhat.  Do they diminish the impact that Physical Graffiti could have had if it was cut down to one LP/disc?  Unquestionably. <br /> <br />Zeppelin would see their artistic focus and drive wane in the coming years, as their albums got more and more subpar (Presence, In Through the Out Door) and the synths came more and more up front.  But this album stands as their last truly epic artistic statement, anchored by a sense of adventure and powerful songs.  Disc 1 is unparalleled; Disc 2, while somewhat odd, is still worthwhile; and it all makes for a supremely enjoyable album.  Don't hesitate to pick up Physical Graffiti.
B000063COX|5.0|Iron Maiden's first album is AMAZING!!!!!!! One of the best metal albums of all time.  Yet, if you're new to the band you might want to check out something that Bruce Dickinson sings on (Number of the Beast probably the best place to start.)

It's a must - have for any metal fan. It contains such metal classics as \\"Running Free\\", \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", \\"Prowler\\", \\"Iron Maiden\\" (the song), \\"Sanctuary\\", and \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" plus, their softer yet really good track \\"Strange World\\" and possibly Iron Maiden's best instrumental track \\"Transylvania\\".  In my opinion \\"Charolette the Harlot\\" is the weakest track on the album and really it's not a bad song at all. <br />  Next time you're in a record shop I'd pick this up if you're familiar with Iron Maiden you won't be dissapointed.  I hope this review was helpful to you. <br />
0765348780|4.0|If you are looking for another \\"farmboy nobody is the chosen one to embark on a quest to save the world, and succeeds\\", then this is not for you. If you want something that's been done over and over again, then go elsewhere. If you are searching for a new, fresh direction that is all it's own, then welcome. This is intelligent, deep, and engrossing. This is complex, exciting, and at moments completely breathtaking. This is the world that Steven Erikson has created. Truly epic, and written on a grand scale, this is a wonderful start to what will be IMO one of the greatest series ever. Not to be read casually, this is a book that demands the readers attention, and thoroughly rewards the readers that do so. There are many characters and groups here, each with agendas of thier own.  This is not good guys vs. bad guys, which is quite refreshing and makes the characters much more realisic IMHO. There are many different forces involved in the story, even the Gods themselves! This book has a bit of everything and weaves it all together fantastically. Some may complain about character depth, but I say we've got another nine books to get to know some of these people quite well. The bottom line is that this is great and will get much better. Do yourself a favor, pick this one up, pay attention, and enjoy.
B00008H2LB|2.0|I know that huge fans of Linkin Park are just gonna rip my review up because it'll hurt their egos, so go ahead and trah me. But if you look at this album objectively, it's just not really that good. Look, to be fair, the execution is very tight and professional, but it just seems that the band has really failed to expand on their sound. I thought \\"Hybrid Theory,\\" was great, don't get me wrong - it was unique, sleek, hard hitting and effective. I got \\"Meteora\\" for my 16th birthday and sold it, purely because I though it was too much like a copy of \\"Hybrid Theory.\\" It seems that the band are just trying to appeal to the masses rather than creating really awesome music. Now if \\"Meteora\\" swopped places with \\"Hybrid Theory\\" (in terms of their releases), I would probably be saying all of this about \\"Hybrid Theory.\\" I don't expect Linkin Park to change their sound, but I have no problem with bands experimenting and evolving over a slow period. That's really great, because when a band does that they are constantly pushing the boundaries of normality and the accepted. \\"Hybrid Theory,\\" did that. \\"Meteora,\\" is based on the same successful formula as \\"Hybrid Theory,\\" so if you can't hear that, well I suppose you need to get your ears cleared...<br /><br />My brother has this album. He played it every day for 5 weeks and I heard it every morning before I went to school. I tried to like it, but it was just too repetitive, formulaic and uninspired. I give credit to Linkin Park for the wonderful execution, but I feel they should try to bring the level of production down to give a more raw sound. Now that would be impressive I think! I've been playing guitar since I was 14 (I'm 18 now), and I just find that Brad Delson hasn't changed his sound. The tone on the guitar lacks hugely, so we get waves of barely distinguishable chords that sound way to fuzzy. It was cool on the first album, but to do that again, on every track of the album (just about), is just annoying I'm afraid. Chester's lyrics are easy to hear and that's good, but the lyrics are, like the album, repetitive and talk about very similar issues that were (surprisingly) discussed on \\"Hybrid Theory.\\" Mike Shinoda also raps and sings less on this album, and I feel that his vocal talents are pushed under the rug, which is sad because he is very talented as a singer. Perhaps Joseph Hahn is the strongest on this album as his samples and sounds are pretty cool, but just aren't highly unique. Still, he does the best overall and pulls the band up a bit. The drums could be more definitive and louder, but it is very difficult to get a strong drum sound without compromising the lyrics. So I'll let that slide on this album.<br /><br />I believe that Linkin Park are / were pioneers. They can change everything, and I believe that still, but unfortunately they have stuck to where they feel most safe. They don't want to lose their fans, which is understandable. Hey, I'm a fan of the first album still and I'll give their next album a listen because they are a frightfully strong group. But these guys mustn't be afraid of their abilities, they can push the boundaries. Unfortunately with their \\"Collision Course\\" album with Jay-Z, I think they're pushing the wrong boundaries. Linkin Park teeter on the line between Metal and Hip-Hop, and it seems they're gravitating closer to Hip-Hop, which is a very, very bad thing.<br /><br />Overall, I give Meteora 2/5. It's tight and professional and has some inspired moments, but for the greater part it's a lacklustre album that's too formulaic and focusing on stereotypical and similar issues.<br /><br />So maybe this review isn't helpful. A reviewer's job is not always to agree with everyone but approach things objectively. So even though this review is in the negative region doesn't mean you should say it isn't helpful. If I haven't changed your thinking or given you a new thought, then please vote \\"No\\" for me because then I have failed. If I have challenged yourviews and have made you look at things in a new light, you have no choice but to vote \\"Yes.\\" I know this has nothing to do with the album, but too many people on Amazon vote \\"No,\\" just because they feel attacked. Well I'm not attacking anyone - if you like it, great! Then by all means like it! It's just my opinion, 1 man out of 6 billion people. You can say \\"f*** him.\\" But that doesn't mean I'm not helpful, right? Thanks for your time...enged your views and have made you look at things in a new light, you have no choice but to vote \\"Yes.\\" I know this has nothing to do with the album, but too many people on Amazon vote \\"No,\\" just because they feel attacked.

1573223085|5.0|This is a book that can make a huge difference to our personal and professional life, irrespective of what we do for a living. The world so far was dominated by L-centred professionals or those whose who predominantly excel in using the left side of the  brain. The admission tests to get into the best of today's professional courses test our analytical, arithmetic and verbal skills. The good news is that we have done well so far. But the bad news is that in the industrial age followed by the information we have utilised only one half of our brain, that is the \\"left\\".  Welcome to the conceptual age which demands our \\"right\\" and rightfully so. <br /> <br />The author first explains the functioning of the human brain , its left and right sides and what they stand for, in a very simple and non jargon approach. His personal understanding of the functioning of the brain using the fMRI scan technology may appear over simplistic to a well trained medical professional or psychologist. But the information is sufficient to guide us through the subsequent chapters that fully engage both the sides of the brain.  <br /> <br />We now live in an era of abundance (the wide range of goods at rock bottom prices at the neighbourhood shopping mall), Automation ( computers take over repetitive jobs) and emergence of Asia ( off shoring of white collar jobs at fractional costs). Today's products and services are an outcome of sequential, analytical and logical thought process of the L-centred professions. <br /> <br />To succeed in the next age which is conceptual, we need to wake up and kick start the right side of our brain argues the author. For example we need abilities to synthesise not just analyse. Synthesis is the ability to assemble the parts and see the whole thing while analysis is the ability to focus on specifics. The conceptual age needs high concept and high touch, a combination of right side capabilities along with the left side strengths. These then become the winning combination to differentiate, add value and succeed. <br /> <br />The author lists six senses or essential aptitudes - Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, play and Meaning that are the basic ingredients of the conceptual age. A chapter for each and a good reference list ( titled portfolio section) includes books and web sites that provide us with rich source of information for further study. <br /> <br />The examples quoted under every topic are simply great. To cite one such example in the chapter on Story : <br /> <br />The queen died. The king died. <br /> <br />The queen died and the king died of a broken heart. <br /> <br />The first line conveys a fact. The second line conveys a story and we can feel the love. Stories combine context and emotion and appeal to our hearts. Unfortunately, most professionals focus on facts. Doctors interrupt patients on an average once in 23 seconds looking only for clinical data. But if they listen to the patients' stories, the context and emotion can make a big difference, in addition to the facts. <br /> <br />Another good example is Design. Design is the process of bringing new forms that the world has never seen. It is a combination of utility and substance. The CEO of  a major car manufacturer claims that his company is in the art business and transportation is incidental. Design schools are the ones that can transform our products into things of joy. No wonder this profession has started gaining so much attention even in countries like India. ( Please refer to my review of the book \\" The Tipping Point\\" by Malcolm Gladwell. I am glad that my daughter has since chosen a course on Accessory Design and I am now able to appreciate her wisdom!) <br /> <br />The message is clear. The professional of the future is one who can appreciate the finer aspects of life that includes beauty, meaning and happiness.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed every moment of this book. Guess whom I am gifting it to ?
006441034X|4.0|Only learned about this title because of the box office hit Japanese animation of the same title directed by the master Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki.  Since I missed watching it in the cinema, I bought the book of which the movie was based on.  I couldn't put it down and finished it in one go!  While it may not be as breathtaking as some of the Harry Potter novels, it's level of imagination is unsurpassed.  I just bought another title by Diana Wynne Jones (Castle in the Air), and can't wait to start reading it.
B0007TKH66|5.0|I bought this for my husband because he is a true Trekkie Geak.  He was never able to fully appreciate the sights and sounds because we had such bad cable.  He was pleasantly surprised by my gesture.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I could honestly not care less who from the '80s Interpol sounds like. They wrote their own songs, and the songs are very good (this goes for Antics as well, but this album is probably better). <br /> <br />It's not that I have no appreciation of older music and only listen to whatever is popular right now, it's just that I don't care. I listen mostly to classic rock (Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Van Halen, Black Sabbath, Hendrix, Pink Floyd, stuff like that), but when I saw Interpol play Slow Hands (from Antics) on Leno, I thought they were great. Now I have both of their albums and can listen to them start to finish. <br /> <br />I realize I didn't give any analysis of the actual music; I'm just reacting to all the reviews that focus exclusively on who Interpol sounds like. Who cares?
B0007TKNL0|5.0|So many productions of Phantom of the Opera, but this movie version is destined to become the standard by which all others are judged.  Great scenes, vocals, music!  Can't miss this one!
B00097A5I6|2.0|I was excited for the new Oasis album, to come out.  Upon hearing the record, my hopes for a great album were  <br />  dashed as \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" is truly an uninspiring disc.   Lazy arrangements, songs that don't seem  <br />  finished, eg. The Meaning of Soul, dominate this record.  There are a two bright spots, Andy and Gem's \\"Keep The  <br />  Dream Alive\\", and \\"A Bell Will Ring\\", give this collection some meaning.  Other than that, this sounds like a group  <br />  going through the motions, void of any creativity and magic of earlier records.
B0009RCPY8|4.0|\\"We've been going about this all wrong. This Mr. Stay-Puft is o.k. He's a sailor. He's in New York. We get this guy layed we won't have any problems.\\" - Pimpin' ain't easy for the \\"Ghostbusters\\"<br /><br />I give four stars for both films, but, this new 2 disc re-release to \\"Ghostbusters\\" & \\"Ghostbusters II\\" is nothing to scream about, let alone melt old Stay-Puft.<br /><br />After being kicked out of N.Y.U., three parapscycholgists go into business for themselves as paranormal investigators & elimanators known in the New York tri-state area as the \\"Ghostbusters\\".<br /><br />Their first case has to do with the demon Gozer the Gozarian while the following case has the boys going after a Carpathian warrior named Vigo on New Years Eve.<br /><br />Sony Home Entertainment has severely dropped the ball on these films. Rumor had it that a 20th anniversary DVD edition was supposed to be released in late '04, early '05 with nothing happening (I also saw a listing for \\"Ghostbusters\\" on this website oddly enough in the movie showtimes part of the website. I thought maybe there might be a slim chance of a theatrical re-release, but, sadly to no avail).<br /><br />The new 2 disc set has both films in the same remasterd versions as in the previous release with a scrapbook & 2 animated episodes from the series. Missing from \\"Ghostbusters\\" is the trailers from the two films plus the trivia track (that was really cool).<br /><br />The \\"Ghostbusters\\" movies are great, but, this new DVD re-release is nothing to die for. Stick with the first releases.
0767805712|5.0|After 12 Monkees, this is the most daredevil film concerned with a future not so far.<br />A fable based on an uncertain future where the citizens are genetically engineered to be perfect will be the dramatic device to an invalid man who dreams of space travel and assumes the identity of a perfect worker. Everything seems under control but, the strategic planning has nothing to do with the randomness of the existence.<br />Science and scientists often serve the existing powers. But the level of increasing complexity and advanced technological level are molding a state into the state. The nature of power can acquire hues of major repercussion that we ever know. In this new state of things the law's spirit may become a simple spectator giving unsatisfactory answers and acting with a terrible handicap on its shoulders. There are many ethic and moral abysses that must be discussed and considered, the facts don't let to exist simply because we ignore them. And sooner than later the mankind will have to face this dilemma.<br />Magnificent script with precognitive situations and riddles for solving. A winner film which threw to Jude Law to fame's sand around the world.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Let me be a man and apologize (even though she will never read this most likely) for ever thinking that Mariah was finished.  This album, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" (still not getting how she gets Mimi out of Mariah, but her deal), shows that she still has \\"it\\".  This is by far one of the best albums of the year (at the least from the female R&B category)!  I consider myself a fan of her work over the years and of her, but not a huge fan like others.  After she had that bomb with Glitter, her nervous breakdown, and Eminem dissing all over her, it appeared that she was past the point of no return.  But low and behold, she shows with this album that obstacles are put in the way for you to overcome them and for you to come out stronger on the other side without this statement sounding clicheish.  The main reason I bought this album was because it was Mariah and it was on sale at my job and it was selling like hotcakes.  So I decided to cop it.  Some of my best buys have been with that tactic.  Getting them on sale while not expected too much (similar to the Keyshia Cole and Faith Evans albums).  It is good to see how some artists are back to making albums that you can't sit back and just listen to and let play.  The first two tracks are of course the first two singles which I felt hearing them over the radio (the remix to We Belong Together is better and should've been added).  Shake It Off is my favorite of the singles which is the next track.  One of my favorites on the album is \\"Say Somethin\\" with Snoop.  Unexplainable, I'm just really feeling that one.  Stay the Night is also a standout track.  One and Only could have been a bit longer for me, but it is still a really great track with Twista on it.  After that, her voice really gets displayed nicely with that last few tracks especially with Your Girl, I Wish You Knew, Joy Ride, and a track dedicated to her triumphant return \\"Fly Like A Bird.\\"  Nice ecclectic mix of songs you can dance to, groove to, feel, and relaxwith a honey of yours.  Great job, Mariah!  Let me be one of those to say, Welcome back!  Overview (why buy album)  1. Great production  2. Voice shines again  3. Great mix and well balanced  4. Shows journey and return    (Side note:  The Platinum Edition is even better than the original with the songs they added to it.  Don't Forget About Us is truly hypnotizing.  That song is right there with One and Only as my favorite song.  The track with Jermaine Dupri, Makin' It Last All Night, is cool.  It slides by.  So Lonely with Twista is very nice.  They blend well together.  But what I had suggested in the beginning was added also, and that was putting the remix to We Belong Together with Jadakiss and Styles on the album.  I truly like the beat and the whole track together (including adding a male side and perspective to it) better than the original.  And the original was tight!  These four tracks pretty much elevated the album even more.  I thought Keyshia Cole and Faith's albums were right there with hers for solos.  But she most likely created some distance between them.  This is a must have for 2005!  Go cop the Platinum Edition!  Well worth the price of admission!)
B0007DAZW8|4.0|Daft Punk's third CD is humorously named Human After All, as this is the most robotic/electronic CD they've made.  This time around, instead of Discovery's funky-style house, it's back to raw techno sound but is still quite different than Homework. <br /> <br />To get to the bottom line, out of all ten tracks, I liked every one of them.  Some people may think this music is boring, but this is house, it has to be repetitive because it's ultimately for dancing to at the club.  And it's not the exact same loops for 4 or 5 minutes, they do have significant variation.  Anyways, I like this album a lot (comming from a fan who liked the previous 2 albums) but I think it's a little short.  Sure, they made it in 6 weeks, but it feels a little empty compared to the usual 15 or 14 track album.  Other than it's shortness, (thus 4 stars out of 5) it's a great album.  Definitely worth adding to your collection.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|Kun-fu Hustle is a fun martial arts comedy. With how cartoonish it can be, I guess you can call it a fantasy as well. Even if you are tired of Kun-fu movies you should be entertained by this movie. It has the style of an old black and white movie in some ways. It sort of reminded me of a Buster Keaton movie is some ways. I mean by the comedy, not the martial arts of course.<br /><br />  You have a lady with curlers in her hair that can run as fast  as  the road runner and who's main power is her screaming. Also scrawny looking guys who are really great warriors. One of the funniset scenes takes place when  Stephen Chow challenges some town people to a fight. He wants to prove himself worthy to a badass gang. Anyway each person he chooses that look wimpy turn out to be covered in muscles. Even a little kid that he challenges, is ripped. The movie is great fun and good for a laugh even if the final battle is overly silly and not as funny as it could've been.
B000002BE9|5.0|And I would still say this is the best CD I have heard.  It just always comes back to Fiona Apple's Tidal.  The only song that I MIGHT skip is Criminal that is ONLY because radio ruined it for me!  Love this CD!
