B000EBGREI|5|My husband loves it and says it works really well on his hair. He definitely would recommend it to others.
B00359S9D8|5|I start with the color, I wear Light in BE and I have to use the lightest color from UD-Illusion. I use regular powder brush (fluffy for soft coverage and flat for more heavy). The powder is great-makes my skin poreless, bright and very natural. I'd like to have a better coverage, but it is buildable.  I don't need a bit of touch up, it lasts the whole day, even with working out. It doesn't cake or sits in the lines or pores, I have this problem with BE (it cakes after a while or disappears from around mouth area). Basically UD makes my skin look better. No breakouts or itchiness.  I've tried in the past also Jane Iredale, Glo minerals, BE and Artdeco from Europe (too bad they don't sell it in USA because this is a true winner!) and UD is my number 2. Pretty decent but it lacks in SPF and the main ingredients are methylparaben and propylparaben which is weird. But it works I guess.  I also want to try Sephora brand mineral loose powder, which is a bit different concept- a lot of great for skin ingredients and half price of UD.
B003U3CJNK|1|There should no a No Star option.  This product looks great but only worked for one time only.  Tried a brand new battery, but no luck.  Just \\"dead as a doornail\\" after one use.
B001MA0QY2|5|Blue Novelties has done what very few companies do nowadays. They offer top-quality products at amazing prices - and the best part? Their customer service etiquette goes above and beyond to make sure you receive your product quickly and that you are pleased with it! Definitely a stand up supplier that has gained a customer for life! The HSI flat iron only takes about 15 seconds to heat up (410 is the temp I use) and glides through my hair leaving it very straight and shiny. Just as good as the CHI Deep Brilliance that I have used until now - and at a considerable savings!
B00KCFAZTE|1|Most of the positive and 5 star reviews are by people who received this product for free or at a reduced cost, maybe even fake reviews.  This product is not effective in any way.<br />I am in my early 30s and I have some under eye puffiness/bags mostly in the morning.  Will be requesting a refund.
B00143YCLK|1|I had not even tried the product and the pump snapped off.  I would have liked to have gotten a replacement but I do not care to print the label, package, and go to the post office.  I will deal with it and not buy this again.
B00BW5NLNU|4|I really wish the description had more detail. It's not clear what the 100s refers to, could mean several things.
B003U8ESI4|1|Dead after 10 months of using it about twice a week. I also took very good care of it. Cleaned it, never dropped it, etc.
B009NNFB0O|5|Had my first beard balm experience at my local barber. Like it enough to search Amazon for it. Found this stuff, and since it uses natural ingredients, thought I would give it a shot. It's a small container, but a little bit of this stuff goes a long way. Smells real good. Even the wife likes the smell. No flakes on my shirt anymore either. Would recommend this to anyone who loves their facial hair.
B00CPPKBZC|5|Awesom smell and fast shipping!😁
B00HHCPHO8|3|Love it as an eyeshadow primer, and I use a touch in the center of my upper lip and on the corner of my eyes to brighten those areas up. Also right above the ends of my eyebrows. I really didn't find that it blended well but it does a good job of highlighting very small areas. Needs to be patted on, doesn't stay on a brush. It's not what I was expecting, because it doesn't work well for break out-prone skin and it doesn't have a very workable texture.. but it is a very concentrated paste so a little goes a long way, and I am glad that I have it for these specific purposes.
B0054Y0R2I|5|They are small but this product is so potent that you don't need a whole lot. My skin is amazing and I take half the time doing my foundation when I get ready. High recommend!
B000NI48ZW|2|This item is misleading. The picture shows you that the item is the white musk voluptuous body creme but you are actually buying what is in the description, the white musk body butter. I purchased this last week thinking I was going to receive what the image shows. I was so disappointed when I received this so please be aware that the image is incorrect.<br /><br />I never rate anything online but I had to because other people may need to know what they think they are purchasing and what they receive are 2 different things. White musk body butter is still a good product but the voluptuous creme is much better. Unfortunately, I can't find it anywhere on Amazon.
B001AZ9NB6|5|This stuff is great to have on days I need to cover those greys but dont have time to sit at the hair salon!  It also adds a bit of volume to the roots, so for me especially with my fine hair, it's a win-win!<br />My salon only carries the one oz bottle, and they charge close to 30 bucks for it! (Only $10 less than this one is!)<br />So it's a total steal.<br />Im very happy with this find.<br />:-)
B002W2N8FI|5|I got this gel because I wanted the mosquito repellent qualities without the oiliness of the regular oil/lotion.  This gel is PERFECT.  It's not greasy, and dries to a silky, powdery feel.  A little goes a long way.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.  I am going to keep using it after mosquito season, just because I love the way my skin feels with it.
B0007CXWXI|5|I love this product! I have used it for over a year every day. It's the only hair product that I currently use. I have very fine hair and it doesn't make my hair feel stick-like or heavy.<br /><br />I haven't experienced any hair breakage or loss? I use a very small amount each day and this 6.7 pz bottle lasted over a year. I also have oily hair so maybe that kept the product from drying my hair out?
B007FCAAWY|5|i must say that i love the shoe clips they are perfect however, i mad the mistake of  ordering the wrong shade. but i made it work
B009NAE8RO|1|First it's not like the picture, I recived different color<br />Second it was damaged once I get it<br /> I will give 0 out of 10
B003F64GCE|5|this product takes away and ry skin you may feel and stays that way for at least 12 hour
B009ESL1U2|2|I really ordered the ed hardy cologne because of the skull bottle! hoped the cologne was nice, it does smell ok but it doesn't last!:(
B004AM6RTW|5|Lisa Eldridge used this in one of her makeup videos showing makeup for &#34;mature skin.&#34;  I'd never used cream blush before, and was curious.  I love it!  For years I've been wearing Bare Minerals, with their &#34;warmth&#34; powder, but it's really just a glow, not a blush.  Now that I'm older I need a little more makeup (liquid or cream foundation) and this blush works great with them.  I only need a small amount to give a really natural flushed look, as if I just came in from the cold, or a run. ;)  I'm blond with fair skin, and this color is perfect.  I'm not even halfway through it, but I feel like buying more, just so I never run out!
B003NCXXIS|5|Really a nice product - allows you to reach all areas of your back without effort.  The cutter design is great - clips close without cutting or scratching you.
B00FAXAJZ8|5|Great quality.
B000GX1N52|5|Love love love this product!!! Leaves your skin nice and soft with a refreshing scent. Definitely on my reorder list!!!
B000DN7BUQ|4|I love this hippie stuff! Ordered for a body spray. It last well. Good customer service, would use product and customer again. The wash is also good. Thanks
B000O8R4CA|3|I didn't really use this long enough to be able to tell if it works or not.  It's rather expensive for such a small bottle.
B008X75CYQ|3|For most bauty products I have favorite brands.  Alas, it is not the case with mascaras.  As beauty companies are coming up with new products that make lashes look better, thicker, more voluminous  I keep searching for the brand that will make me completely happy.  Clinique is trusted brand so I gave them a try.  This mascara will definitely make your lashes look long and thick.  I use it in black color and my lashes really open up the eyes after macara application.  However you need to be careful how much mascara you apply on the lower lashes.  Product has ability to smudge by the end of the day.  So while it is not perfect, it is a good product worh giving it a try.
B0058J63MC|5|this is my wife's favorite perfume she absolutely loved this the hand bag that was included was really nice highly recommend shipped fast.
B00LYLJJO2|5|Love these tweezers very easy to use and can get the tiniest of hairs.  Shipping was quick and will purchase again from the seller.
B006OMHR1S|5|I do read reviews before I make a purchase and I tend to focus on the negative ones to figure out all that is wrong with a product. Well I can tell you that whatever issues others were having with these plates have been corrected. The depth is perfect. I did not receive any duplicates. Got exactly 26 and could not be happier.
B00GBFYWBG|5|Excelent product. I love it. Is good can take a shower with the delicious body gel,...and after put on body cream and for finish the splash for you have a very good day.
B00KB58E70|4|I love these brushes.  They are great for eyeshadows, eye and nose contouring and blending in concealer.
B004IUNPBO|2|This was not a designed grouping, just disparate elements thrown into an envelope. They light was cheap and poorly made and the mouthpieces are of dubious quality. I'd recommend a better 'set' or picking out your own individual pieces.
B003SSVKBY|3|Eh, I like the premier eye cream better in the green container. I seemed to get instant results with the other stuff. The Vivo also came in a tall clear squirting bottle with pump. Not like the one pictured here.
B002XQ1YHM|4|The lotion is great, but was delivered a date later than promised. I wish both the lotion and Cologne could come from the same source, it would save me money and be much more expedient
B000NIEBK4|5|Smells Great. Feels Great. Best smelling hand lotion I've ever used. Hard to find in stores, so I searched and found online (Amazon has everything!). Everyone always wants to borrow this when I put it on.
B004BGS58S|5|For me personally, I love this product!  After washing my face I always put this under my eyes.  It just makes that area under my eyes soft and not dry looking.  This works best for me.
B00A99XF0Y|5|The best part about this soap is how easily it rinses off.  Same for the dish soap.  A bit expensive.
B006DLMHYW|5|I have dry and sensitive skin, this mask is very good, you can use it any time you need your skin looks shiny and perfect! I have bede using Siberica cosmetics since long time, and would definitely recommend it to everybody!
B003IDFXSA|5|I bought this super large tote last Xmas for a gift and the recipient loved this .  It measures about 20 X 16 and is vinyl and bright candy pink in color, surface washable and had the VS logo on it,  new<br />Snap closure/no zip<br />For the price and availabilty was PERFECT for gift giving<br />Thanks to Amazon<br />5 stars on this one just what she wanted
B00HF7G27G|4|Great product.  It is a deodorant so it does not stop wetness but it does prevent you from smelling.  It is a more of a natural product and does not contain aluminum.  It is pretty effective.
B0054Y2C30|5|makes my curls look good :)
B00KRBLD1C|4|great stuff will order again.
B00B1DRA94|5|This is a great product at a good price. The applicator is great because of it's very fine line.  The color was perfect.  When applying I didn't have to keep going back over my line to make it darker or get it to adhere. Stayed on great all day.  Easy to remover as well. Really like this product !!
B007XKY3CQ|5|this stuff is awesome.wal-mart sold it.but now they sale bodycology.this stuff smells great.it bites that simply basic is discontinued. :'(
B00MVOB6U6|1|Sucks
B00D1476FO|5|This face wash is wonderful on my skin. I recommend this wash for everyone- teens to adults. There is no odor and very soft on the skin. I have used about 3 bottles and still continue to use it. I also recommend the products that go with the face wash listed on the back of the bottle.
B00LSYDTYQ|2|NOT MOISTURIZING. Barely makes a difference in appearance of skin- even after several uses.
B00AEB6G4O|5|Really good!!!
B003BQL8DS|5|Ive been buying elumen on amazon for a couple years now. I have never had a problem! Love it.
B002VHQOHI|5|I like the product. Manly smell and non-greasy.  Use after tanning.
B0049LUI9O|5|You know your getting old when you have to buy one of these.  It has been easy to use. Tickless when first using, but once to get use to it it does a great job tamming those out of control ear and nose hairs. I would recommend this product.
B003I3NEZ4|5|Good
B005NZ6790|5|This clipper works great and never pulls my hair.  I also like the scissors it came with.  Great kit.
B00LBG49CM|5|Love this mascara. I have long lashes already and when I use regular mascara I get extra volume and length but I still wanted something that looked like I had false lashes on without having to wear false lashes. I HATE false lashes. More power to all the women who can wear them and can put them on everyday. So, I kept seeing this mascara on Instagram and finally decided to try it. Love it! It is EXACTLY the look I was going for. My lashes are even longer, there is more volume, they are full, and people think they are fake but I love telling them they are all mine.
B000NL0T1G|3|Well... I've had this razor for 3-1/2 yrs. It did well without any real problems. Today though as I went to change the blade the head busted off from the bolt that holds the head to the handle. Maybe a freak occurrence,  still disappointing though. Think I'll go for a butterfly model this time around.
B002EMLQ28|2|I guess it's my fault. I should have read the ingredients before I bought this. When water is the first ingredient & propylene glycol is the second, a &#34;moisturizer&#34; will feel moisturizing as long as it sits on the surface of your skin. Then, the propylene glycol (a --dehydrating-- chemical) will dry out your skin, with the help of the evaporating water.<br />So.<br />Enough about that. The lotion feels pretty creamy going on. It doesn't absorb particularly quickly, and I haven't noticed that my skin feels any more hydrated than it did before, when I used lotion made with shea butter and pure coconut milk.<br />It should be noted that this lotion includes &#34;pigment boosters,&#34; which can mean different things, depending on the company. The lotion is a brownish-gray color, which makes me think there are self-tanners or bronzers in it, but I'm not sure. I do know that ingredients like tyrosine help the skin naturally hold more pigment, but tyrosine is the last ingredient, so I don't think that's going to help much.<br />Maybe I'm overanalyzing it, but I don't see the point to this lotion. And it's not very comfortable. It's kind of sticky, and then balls up and flakes off. I think that's what made me go ingredient-hunting in the first place.<br />I wouldn't recommend it.
B005BZ3EES|5|I am a firm believer in aroma therapy. Scents have an affect on a person's mood and this product named \\"Captivating Shimmer Mist\\" is exactly that. It has captivated my sense of smell like no other body mist has. After bathing and applying the mist my senses come alive. I feel a wind of happiness overcome my senses. I feel as if I am in a tropical island full of delicious aromatic flowers. Subsequently I am able to review the events of the day in a peaceful state of mind. I am sooooo sad that the product has been discontinued. My time of reflection will not be the same.  I am desperately seeking my island of calm and without this body mist I am afraid I am lost. PLEASE BRING BACK MY CAPTIVATING SHIMMER MIST.
B00371PJ1E|5|Use this in conjunction with lye soap twice a day then apply dry skin cream to plaque psoriasis. After a couple of weeks it made it look like my old self again. Just a little red spot on my elbows. Try this method and maybe it will work for you.  I know how psoriasis can make you feel nasty and ashamed. I have my self esteem back now. The dry skin cream I use is prescription Triamcinlone Acetonide.1%. Hope this helps you like it did me.
B0047HGD4E|4|It is a good product and does it's job exactly as advertised. Two things I would mention to the new buyers - it takes a while to start the steam. If you are not in absolute hurry then it is not an issue. I primarily use it for sinus treatment. I wish the volume of the steam could have been little more. But the current amount of steam will be workable for most of the people.
B00C2DK7ZG|5|love these products, would recommend the entire line
B0092MCMGC|5|love this item. Looks better in person. Thank You!
B009OAT15M|5|It has a Wonderful scent, feeling, and gentle cleaning. Everyone I show this to loves it. Great for Christmas or birthday presents.
B00HOQQ77S|4|I love all the sweaty band headbands.  This one is beautiful!!  The only issue I have with them is, that over time they stretch out =/
B001HLP4A2|5|I LOVE these eye shadows! I've used them for years and now they don't sell them in stores anymore. I was so excited to find them on Amazon. The colors are gorgeous and last all day. I love these so much I bought 2 of each color and there's about 10 of them. Not sure what I'll do when I run out and can't find them anymore. I've tried lots of eye shadows in my 33 years and never found one I love as much as these.
B001HKR6WM|1|The quality is not acceptable.  The brushes are stiff to the point that it scratches your face.  The bristles call out all over your face from its shedding.  The only decent ones are the eyebrow brush and the eyeliner one that I can use at a lip liner in a pinch.  I threw them out!  They cannot be used.
B009CUENXO|5|So easy. So amazing. So worth it!
B00NQGWFCQ|5|I have very dry skin and this has made my skin feel supple again.
B000FL5CDE|5|I have used this for years and it still remains faithful. If you like natural products Dr Hauschka is one of my favorites
B004O3WOMQ|5|Perfect!
B000GBMYC0|5|Change every ~6 months to get like new performance with your shaver. Braun suggests longer periods but I am willing to pay little bit for better performance.
B000VWZ04I|1|I used Zydot Ultra clean the day of my hair test and it DID NOT WORK. Needless to say I was only trying to cover up weed which I had stopped smoking almost 2 months prior, before that I smoked on a regular basis. IT guaranteed me it would work or my money back so now I am trying to get my money back. The lady at the store said buy 2 boxes because my hair is thick. I did exactly what she said and followed the directions precisely and I still failed my hair test and the HR lady said my test came back as I was a user!! I lost the great job and now I am unemployed again. It's safe to say the only way to pass a hair test is to stop smoking a minimum of 3 months before.
B0050QJHTO|3|it does the job but the curls don't last too long =/
B0060M92CO|5|I've used this soap ever since it came out several years ago.  Prior to that I used regular Dove for the last +30 years.  I love it!!!!!!!!  Please Unilever do not quit making this fragrance as it has such a clean smell and feel.
B000WHYATS|2|Counterfeit product. Definitely not tweezerman. Probably will function but if you're buying a brand for quality reasons, this is not your seller.
B006RGMIT2|1|If you like a strong flowery smelling lotion, than this is for you.  Yuck- I'll be throwing this out.
B002VCPD2A|1|I bought the Flexaway System in April 2012 and tried it for a couple of days but the foam which you place inside the upper lip keeps slipping out and the device itself is very uncomfortable. I returned the product within 30 days but till todate (October 3)I have not received the refund.  I have also complained to the Better Business Bureau of Detroit and Eastern Michigan. I even paid for the return shipping but I have not heard from the company.  When you call the listed no. it goes to a voice mail. So don't waste your money as if you are not satisfied, the company will not refund your money.
B00GXZSAE4|3|Many years ago I used Nivea products, but then slowly migrated to Gillette products.  Then I tried Proraso cream, Van Der Hagen soap, and Barbasol foam.  In my opinion, all of those perform very similarly.  The nicks/cuts depend on the razor and how accurately you use it.  For example, with a new double edge razor I get a clean shave with minimum of nicks and cuts, bit as the razor dulls, the occurence of nicks and cuts increases as expected.  Either product performed the same when I tried them with rotary or linear electric razors.  I like Nivea's marketing presentation, but I think this shaving cream is too expensive for the same or marginally better performance than the one cheaper products offer.
B0006NZ5RO|5|These are just delicious!  I remember having these as a child in the 60's under the name Allenbury's.  These are just the same as the originals.
B00C8R39TM|5|Love it
B002BQ3DIC|4|when ever i just washed my hair, its always really thick and puffy which i like. so i would recommend to apply only a certain amount that you really need. this lotion thins and shines hair when you apply which is not bad. so i only apply little so my hair stayes thick and puffy the way i like it
B001OOLLVS|5|I like that one
B002NX0T5I|1|Thoroughly disappointed. Opened package and there was animal hair on it, then it was way to big. Fit more like a medium/large. Sent it back.
B006KT316K|5|This is a great hand cream. It makes my hands feel really soft. Now all my friends use it and order it on a regular basis.
B00CNE5WYA|5|I purchased this toothbrush based on a recommendation by my dentist. I have been waging war on peridontial disease for years, I recently switched dentist and they recommended this to try to help keep things at bay. Right now I have a couple of 2mm pockets, plus some bone loss around one tooth that they will keep an eye on.  So far after using this sonic are brush, my mouth is noticably cleaner feeling, and I was having a dull discomfort around my 4 front teeth, but after using this it went away.  I have added this brush plus the waterpik to my dental routine.
B001MA0QY2|3|Update - I purchased this flat iron because of the great reviews.  The pros is the swivel cord and it does get hot very quickly, however, I do feel that it pulls my hair.  At first I thought it was just the way I was using it but fast forward and I still have the same issue.  I don't feel it adds any shine to my hair and actually looking for a different one at this time.<br /><br />Original review - I am very happy with this flat iron. It is easy to use and the case is very pretty. The glove is really helpful and the Argan oil smells wonderful.  Excellent purchase for a great price.
B0013FS4XQ|4|I love these drops, especially when I'm in a hurry. But please, make sure you put a base coat or clear coat on top of your natural, clean nail and let it COMPLETELY dry, before painting and using these on any additional layers of polish. I also recommend a good cuticle cream, and proper nail maintenance, of course.<br /><br />If you do not have a nice coat of completely dry base, your natural nails will dry out and become brittle!<br /><br />Other than that, like I said, these are totally awesome.
B003ZS8MCM|5|This is a super good deal for these lashes and it was delivered extremely quick! I can't find short lashed anywhere and certainly not for this price! These go quite a long ways if you glue a few together and reuse them.
B0018C0MJS|5|I usually wait 4 my son to visit to get a haircut.<br />Now...all by myself. Great handling and a little advice from my son and...&#34;I did it!&#34;
B003AFI8D8|5|Great price!
B0067H6MC0|1|Didn't help me at all. When I put it on my beginning acne, the next day instead of minimizing it. It made my acne worse and made my beginning acne into white heads. Very upsetting.  Tried various times and every time same result. I guess my skin doesnt work well with product.
B000V0X61O|5|Have used for years. Reacts well to my body chemistry.  I could not find a better price anywhere.
B006BD93M6|4|I was pleasantly pleased with this indoor tanning lotion. I actually ordered it by accident not realizing it was for those who where tattoos. I don't have tattoos but it is still an excellent bronzing lotion. I really like it and will order it again. Some may not like it because it is pretty dark.
B000092OX4|5|present for wife
B00I134Y82|1|So I'VE USED ORGANIC ARGAN OIL MADE BY MODEL AND ENTREPRENEUR JOSIE MARAN AND FELL IN LOVE WITH HERS BUT AT $109/4 OUNCES THE PRICE WAD JUST TOO MUCH FOR FOR MY BUDGET  SO I COME TO AMAZON KNOWING  I COULD EXPECT A BETTER DEAL AND SO I PURCHASED THE BEAUTY BY EARTH BRAND BUT THE PRODUCT SEEMS TO HAVE SOME IMPURITIES OR ITS NOT ORGANIC BECAUSE AS I STARTED TO USE IT, IT BEGAN TO MAKE ME ITCH SO AT FIRST I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE THAT I MIGHT HAVE EATEN BUT BY THE THIRD TIME USING THIS PRODUCT I WAS CONVINCED IT WAS THIS BRAND OF ARGAN OIL.IT ALSO MADE MY ECZEMA WORST THOUGH THIS COMPANY CLAIMS THIS PRODUCT IS RECOMMENDED FOR THE RELIEF OF ECZEMA.AS MANY OF YOU KNOW SO VERY WELL, YOU CAN'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ THESE DAYS!! I HOPE I CAN FIND A BETTER BRAND SOON .😞
B009HULFLW|5|Good, loved it!!
B0049WUFMS|5|I have soft long, fine hair that refused to hold a curl until I tried the Hot Tools wand. I can style my hair in under 20 minutes and it stays curly all day. I couldn't recommend it enough!
B003N2DXPG|4|I have yet to find a stranded flosser that doesn't lose its wax easily. I love the 2 strings, as it gets the food out so much better than one, surprisingly enough. The pick is a little thick, but does the job.
B001ENX2NY|5|They fit well over the face cradle, not perfect, but good enough.  Even when washed/dried, they still retain softness.  Definitely a great buy and would buy again.
B004ZD2M6I|5|This is a great item. I used it once and could tell a difference. Will continue to use them, just ordered the refills too - they seem to go fast, as Amazon is already out of stock of the refills in no time. A+ item.
B000BBGS5O|5|Powerful and durable and quiet.  I got mine from my daughter-in-law who's a stylist and my daughter kept stealing it so bought her the same one for Christmas
B001E5SW9G|5|I have freckles, which many are now calling age spots! This stuff perfectly covers them and stays put! It doesn't move or cake. It's really the only coverage a girl would ever need. I also put it on my legs chest, arms when I'm going somewhere where I care about my appearance.
B000VKZMHK|3|Item is completely as described. It works well in water and cleans easily. I havent set up and used the cleaning/charging stand. I have simply kept the shaver plugged into the wall. It is the best electric razor I have owned but I havent yet tried the Braun unit to compare. I have gotten chafed by having to run the shaver over stubbly areas too  many times; But at the price this unit is more than satisfactory.
B0080L9FHA|4|I really really loved this toothpaste, but my teeth have a few sensitive areas and my dentisit put me back on a sensitive toothpaste. I wish that I could keep using this product, but my receding gum line was getting worse and my teeth were really sensitive. This product was great thou and I feel like my teeth whitened a but while using!
B0002KHUCO|5|This brush head is great for getting close to the gums, it's also perfect for getting around crowns and braces.
B005K70ZWG|1|Was just too small,I threw it out immediately.
B0006BDMIU|5|caudalie has nice products. I have used the face cleanser. I like that too.<br /><br />  My daughter loves the caudalie vinexpert firming serum.  She is 32........ I have bought that for her.<br /> I love the beauty serum.<br />I would like to try the premier cru line some time. Or the contouring concentrate.<br />thank you<br />vicki
B006J2I65Y|4|I saw this at a Ross outlet store and figured for 4.99 what the heck, I could use it as a lint brush.  But amazingly I love this thing, it's gentle and it works!  Like it so much I ran out and found a Ross with more to give to family.  Works to de-fur the heavy undercoat of my Maine Coon cat too (got one just for the pets).  It's not strong enough to pull out heavy mats on a pet, but for what it is it works great.  I'd give it 5 stars except I am not sure how long something like this will last, as the teeth are soft-ish, but feels like a gently massage and detangles my dry-ish colored hair.  The price listed through Amazon is too high, I'd say the 4.99 I paid at Ross is about right.  Was definitely a good buy for me - and still can't believe this works!
B00ARWNVG6|5|Very pretty!
B001MCBWQ6|5|Just like its name. This fragance smells so delicious. Its kinda fruity and sweet. A very decent lasting power. Reminds me of the Coco Mademoiselle.<br /><br />The bottle is gorgeous.<br /><br />I am just a total perfume addicted and this fragance has quickly become one of my favorites.
B003U8ESI4|4|Just what I needed.  Keeps my stubble just the length at which I like it.  Wouldn't trade it for any competitive product.
B006GQYSC8|2|Worked for like a week and then all 3 razors gave out.
B002O7UI18|5|Received this for my birthday.  I'm your typical Barbosol/Colgate $1 a can shave cream guy.  I said to my wife, It's nice, but, it's just soap....<br />Ah ignorance.  Used it this morning with a 3 week old Mach 3 blade and applied it with my fingertips.  The best, most comfortable shave I've EVER had.  My skin is as soft and smooth as a baby's.  Hooked, sold, done.  4 hours later, still smooth.  Great scent.
B0097P24KI|1|I have been always use Shisheido suncream in recently year. But this one I get, make my skin feels itchy. I doubt if that is genuine product.
B00FULYKG4|4|Bought this after I dropped the older version on my marble bathroom floor and cracked the base. This version is clearly much more durable.<br />Pros-<br />  1. I do think it trims closer and cleaner then it's predecessor and leaves less scratches<br />  2. added a boost button. The red button on the front of the trimmer intensifies the trim by at least double the power and is great  for thick haired  areas or just generally a quicker trim.<br />  3. the added shaver head is a huge upgrade. you can now get a true shave as opposed to just a very close trim<br />Cons-<br />  1. just like the earlier version you can not use the trimmer while it is charging (charge gives about 90 min of trim time)<br />  2. Very difficult to use on chest or front of body. the nature of the extension piece makes it awkward to trim your chest or face so you will need a second trimmer if you wish to go full body smooth. Perhaps future versions will allow the trimmer to fold up in the reverse direction so that the shaver head can still be used when the extension is closed<br /><br />All in all a very good product. NOTE: I bought mine at Target bc I have store credit. If you show the customer service the amazon price on your phone they will match this price.
B0045PIFK8|4|Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.
B0065K6R6A|5|I've been looking for a good make up brush holder for a long time.  I tried Micheal's Arts & Crafts store to create an attractive make up space, but nothing really did the job.  I stumbled upon this on amazon and bought it. I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />Not only does it hold all of my make up brushes (about 60), it gives an entire different look to my vanity. I decided to leave one of the circle empty to put my dirty brushes in, so I don't use filthy brushes - it's a nice way to keep them separated and a reminder that these brushes need to be washed.
B00I5QD9WM|5|Nice
B008HHZPT4|5|perfect
B00987RKWW|5|Can't be without this serum, EVER!  It has really improved my skin overall in just two weeks and no product has done that for me.  Pores seem much smaller, the texture of my skin is smoother and my freckles (that I've had for years even after IPL and peels) have lightened!  Love, love love!
B006IBM21K|5|Worth every penny I spent on this gel light unit.  Might have been able to get by with a smaller unit, but so glad I spent the extra money for the larger unit.  I have no worries I will bump into the sides or top when sliding my hand or foot into the unit, nicking the gel.  Gel is the only way to go and now that I'm doing it myself at home (and for friends, if I want), this unit has already paid for itself with the savings from salon prices.  Just watch a couple of tutorials on You Tube and you're ready to go.  Easy Peasy!!  Also, the seller was great, delivered and billed as promised.
B00BFCV5JM|5|Beautiful, elegant, practical with an outstanding build quality.
B00IYSQIPG|5|I bought this for pain I have in my shoulder from an old injury and it has helped immensely. I've used red light therapy on it before but this is way cheaper and works better. Definitely recommend for pain.
B002QBDMB0|5|Love CND Cucumber Heel Therapy! I am a runner and have very bad calluses, but this makes my feet so smooth!  Very reasonably priced on Amazon.  Almost $10 cheaper than at the nail salon I go to!!
B000U0F9GA|5|This a a great mirror.  The light works good for me.  After months of use the light still works.  Even if it goes out I have read it's easy to replace.  I have tried to see for myself if it would be easy to replace and it would be.  Very functional and looks nice.  Well worth the money.
B00GY3ZOMG|5|Soft bristles on all the brushes, the eye shadow holds powder eye shadow great and i love the way the foundation brush applies liquid. I started doing my power concealer last and using the dome top brush is fantastic. I also bought a second set for my sister, I think they're great for her because these are vegan brushes. the kabuki brush isn't as full as other kabuki brushes but it's still useful. I personally love all the small brushes, even though some reviews complained that there were too many small brushes and not enough large ones. For me it was exactly what I wanted.<br />Over all, I would have to say if you're really into doing your eyes and just simple face makeup then this is the perfect brush set for you.
B001B7GJ2E|5|Use it every other day. If I suspect a pimple is about to show up, I just press the area and it usually pops out. It's not painless, and it leaves your face a little red, obviously, but it does the job. It's much easier than popping with your fingers. White and blackheads begone.
B00J7BPL52|5|Excelente
B00J4FA4SA|5|Love it!!!!!
B0076L9BHE|1|Scratched and peeled off within a few hours, and I tried to repair with remaining extra stickers.  Then I could not get them off with nail polish remover.  Overall, frustrating.
B002JPPNUQ|4|The package arrived in a timely manner and I used it twice a day the first month. I did see a glow on my skin and possibly some fullness of the cheek area. The device does shut off a lot and it takes several times to push the on button to get it to turn on. I used it on a spot that I had surgery on February 9th 2014 and I can not see the scar any more. Despite the always turning off I continue to use it every day. Maybe missing four days since I purchased. I visited a family member in September 2014 and again yesterday 4/8/2015. When I knocked at their door they said &#34;oh its Terri I asked mom who the hot chick was&#34; Then they stated I looked great. So I guess the device works. I gave four stars because it is a pain when it shuts off so frequently.
B00ENU1SP4|5|They're sooo great for the price seriously love them especially the flat brush and round pointed one (for the name lol my bad) sooo good for foundation and powder actually that's what I use them for. Would definitely recommend for starters or people who just want nicer brushes for doing make up.
B008LF602I|2|This dried up within a couple weeks, and then was impossible to apply.
B000052YBV|2|I tried it and it doesn't hold anything in place but sure does make a mess! I wouldn't purchase again!
B000N3EGDG|4|Nice brush for the price.  I really like the volume it gives my hair when used while drying and afterwards.
B00FV9PK0U|2|Pictures make it look like it should be a Shimmery Copper color. No where near what the color looks like.
B002CVTVUA|5|I purchased this for my 6 year old granddaughter, & she loves it!  It works well, & is small enough to fit into a little mouth!  (More often than not, she has a big mouth!). She loves having her own &#34;electric&#34; toothbrush, & willingly brushes regularly!  Great purchase!
B00AK7EW5W|5|Good
B00KZHP1GG|3|I didn't realize this model doesn't indicate when 30 seconds have elapsed, and that's a feature I wanted. It does shut off after 2 minutes.
B00J5JBRFE|5|Great product.
B004BCX7TY|4|Lacks true black color but I love the application. It is easy and fluid. Not ideal to create winged eye however and not ideal for a super thin line along lash line. It is also not very thick and very very much not water proof. If you're looking for a liquid gel that won't budge, I would suggest investing in Jemma kid's eyeliner
B001AJOEFM|5|Dynamite!  Finally something to smooth my thick dry hair.  They could change the pump though.
B00DPE9EQO|5|So far I love this product! Absorbs quickly, doesn't cause breakouts and makes skin feel youthful and tight. I have tried many expensive vitamin C serums (Obagi) and this product is far more superior than anyone I have previously tried. I highly recommend it and will continue to purchase for the foreseeable future.
B000UWAWQU|5|This is a wonderful flosser for those who just can't deal with the string type floss. It's powerful and really gets everything out from between your teeth. I have terrible arthritis in my fingers and hands and this makes it so much easier to get your teeth clean. I just can't hold the floss string or even those holders with a piece of floss on a plastic end. I used to have the old type waterpik that had the tank of water you had to fill. This is SO much easier. It takes a little practice. The first time I used it I gave myself a facial and washed the mirror down. Then I got the hang of it. I highly recommend it to anyone because flossing really is important and this makes it not so much of a chore. The tank for the water is right there on the flosser. It feels great after using it too because you can really notice the difference of how clean your teeth are compared to just brushing. I highly recommend this item. A+++++ all the way!
B0002ZS442|5|Excellent, used on my dog.
B00GMAWI66|4|I have been using the argan oil for about two weeks.  I've ben using it on my face instead of my usual night cream and I've noticed a big improvement in the lines in my forehead and those annoying 'apostrophe' marks around my mouth.
B00GNXOZUY|5|Worn this hair three different times and have since bleached it, I love it. Good quality for the price
B00GMAWI66|5|Love this product! Argan Oil has many uses too. I applied it to my just processed dry hair and it was instantly repaired...so soft and shiny. I also put it on my skin and it was absorbed quickly with no oily feel just beautiful healthy skin. I am going to recommend it to my friends and family. Now I know what all the excitement is about!
B00GTC0IY6|5|I'm usually not a huge fan of dry shampoos but this the Suave is the nicest one that I've tried. I recently did some damage to my hair with over processing so I have been trying to go longer between shampoos to avoid drying my hair out even more. I have been using the Suave dry shampoo once or twice a week.<br /><br />The nicest things about the Suave as compared to some other brands I've tried like Tresemme is that it doesn't have an unpleasant scent and it does not dispense that white powder all over my hair. I can't see this in my hair once I've sprayed it on. It does have scent but the scent is not unpleasant.<br /><br />It works well. I don't have oily hair but since I'm waiting between shampoos, my scalp gets a yucky feeling and that feeling goes away as soon as I spray the Suave dry shampoo.
B0015NOTE4|5|I have tried a lot of shampoos, but this one really does work and is very reasonably priced.  Just follow the directions and I find that you don't have to dye your hair as often.  I really like the way it makes my hair feel, too.  And, it smells good!!
B00K90JVG0|2|I wear contacts and if you get the fibers in your eyes, well your screwed for the day. Not crazy about spider eye effect.
B000VKV28S|5|My son loves the razor and the company shipped it out quickly in time for Christmas. Thank you
B002NATQPA|1|This product worked as advertised for the first several months I used it. However, once about half way through and for no apparent reason, the floss started to break whenever I tried to slip it between my teeth.<br /><br />I thought perhaps this was a one time event but after several days of the same thing happening I finally threw this floss out and ordered Oral B floss.<br /><br />I'm not sure this is some sort of gimmick (i.e. they make the last part of this weaker than the beginning because by that point it's too late to return) but I would highly discourage anyone from ever buying this EVER.
B000GX795K|5|This is the best electric I have ever owed and I've owned several.  It really gives a better shave.
B005MR5ZPG|2|This was way too smelly. I know all acrylic liquid smells, but this stuff is horrid.  Before I opened the packaging I could smell it.  Plus the top doesn't screw on all the way.
B00752ZTXO|5|These are great I love the soft pastel color and they work great.  They don't snag my hair and are easily removable .
B008BFUOY8|5|I loved this gun it doesn't stall when I use it and I like that udont need a rubber band to hold your needles. I'll probably buy this again...<br />Note: it is plastic so its not sturdy
B007P7Q4Y2|5|Love this product.
B002DPUY5Q|2|This stuff has a very pleasant honey scent, and comes in a small glass jar. It is very rich-- too rich for my skin. Also, I wasn't a fan of the jar since repeatedly dipping my fingers into the product seems unhygienic.
B00N9BHR1M|5|I received mine 3 days ago and started using it right away at night. The smell takes a little getting used to, but my skin feels amazing in the morning. Will definitely continue to use it and buy it for my daughters
B005Y1B9ZK|5|I have been using this for the last 5 days and looked in the mirror to see where my huge sun spot is from the drivers window, and I had to look super hard to see where is was.  Will be ordering a full size
B001BJJ7EY|1|Is the worst product I ever bought. I don't recommend anyone to buy this crap.    Ps: I also wish they were negative stars to rate this product
B006UK17RY|2|Did not like this very much
B001XSRQA0|5|This charger seems to work as well as the factory Norelco charger did. I had the factory cord charger for more than 20 years but misplaced it. When I looked on the internet for the Norelco charger I did not find the exact original Norelco brand one. I did find several vendors that sold Norelco products and replacements. The Norelco cord charger the vendors sold cost twice the amount of this one. This product is an excellent value for the money and the most important part is that it works. I would recommend this product and will buy from this seller again in the future.
B0043OWJG2|4|great price.
B007WR959Q|5|It was only because I was out of shampoo that I had defaulted to using my Philosophy Animal Cracker shower/shampoo.  I loved it as my shower gel, but I really love it as my shampoo.  I have heavily frosted hair, so I need to use &#34;color friendly&#34; products.  Ironically this works beautifully.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it, whether you were to use it as a shower gel or shampoo - you can't go wrong.
B000Q8UZ2O|4|I bought these for frequent business travel -- save packing space. Each eye shadow card has enough for probably half a dozen applications. The cards are handy, but you are certainly paying for packaging and convenience. The shadow feels soft and looks nice enough on, but creases quickly (alone, or even over a liquid or powder base).
B00KBOCHWE|5|Super Cute!!! Worn this one out and about. Its thick enough that none of the cap shows. One of my favorites. Will buy again. :)
B00GBM0UYW|5|A little tiny, but for the present to a 7 year old it was exactly what we wanted.
B000HRVC5I|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS! I have no clue why it took me so long to finally buy this but this product makes doing making 100 times easier. got it on time and it was packaged very well!
B005FYAM0O|5|The Dabur oil is excellent for the scalp and hair.
B004OT29MA|4|This mascara makes my eyelashes look long, thick, and lovely! My only issue with it is that the brush scoops out so much mascara that it gets very clumpy unless I first blot it with a tissue. Also, being waterproof, it's difficult to remove at the end of the day. However, it's worth it for how gorgeous my lashes look.
B00R8GX6ZU|4|Very soothing scent especially when mixed with ecalytpus oil.
B00K11V2AA|5|Thank you.
B00JX979CQ|5|Love this Emu oil, I am using it for dry skin on my elbows, feet and hands. I use it for chapped lips and as moisturizer under my eyes. I use it 1 to 1 with my body lotion after a shower. It works beautifully and absorbs quickly, a great product at a reasonable price. The company is great, they follow up to be sure you are satisfied.
B00FPN05SO|4|I am a really sweaty person as well as I have nearly constant pain under my arms and I thought it might be a good idea to not wear deodorant to see if that would take the pain away.<br /><br />However, I live in a very hot climate and that's not really possible (to not wear deodorant).  I tried Primal Pit Paste for a couple days and it wasn't perfect, but it worked pretty well.  I was actually really surprised!  And, the pain has been gone since I have been using it.<br /><br />If I am going to be out in public, I do wear regular deodorant, but if I'm just going to be home, I wear no deodorant, or this.
B004KVBL5S|5|I keep these in my wallet/purse/car/briefcase as an emergency backup for the rare occasions that my natural deodorant fails me.  They smell great and always tide me over for a few hours in an emergency.
B001JQLNLY|5|Great product.  Been using it since it was first introduced.
B0015IPA9M|5|This foot file works wonders, this is better than the wavy file foot filer, the ones they sell at walmart, it really buffs down tough callouses, this is definitely a must have!
B00APLA47S|5|Arrived on time and without anything happening to the product.<br /><br />Product details etc are all written in Russian(don't worry your not missing much). Smells good and makes my hair feel good. Overall a good product to use.
B008U5XS2O|3|It does not make any difference to buy a regular flat iron compared to this one except the weird smell that it leaves on my hair. i dont like it. and I would not buy again
B000UVWGGA|4|i use it 1-2x a week, it's a great exfoliater, leaves your skin super smooth and soft.<br /><br />-i have normal to dry skin
B000PB271E|5|Love the Shampoo & conditioner.
B00CQOCRO0|5|My son was pretty much bald until he was nearly 2 and didn't have a need for a hairbrush. Now that he has hair, this brush is perfect. It's way better than the newborn brushes but I'm not sure how it would work if your kid has a ton of hair.<br /><br />Also, it says 'wet brush' but we use it in dry hair all the time and it works really well.
B00MIVSC9K|5|love love LOVE this mascara- but you're better off getting it at ulta or something. this mascara is really $4.99 ... so you'd be paying $10 more here with shipping costs.
B003ZVYQRY|5|I recommend for anyone looking for a simple light empowering fragrance. This is a very sophisticated roll-on oil and lasts about half the day but small enough that you can toss it in your bag, it is light, and classy so if you are looking for something strong and long lasting this is not for you. I love this roll-on because it is such a simple yet complex sophisticated scent, as far as attracting the opposite sex, um well my husband hasn't really reacted to much but there is a slight difference. I would wear this to a job interview!!
B009ERIUNY|5|Fast shipping from seller. These are little bottles, 1/8 oz each. OPI is a quality product, so I'm glad these went on sale since they generally cost more.
B000AMA43Q|5|These soak up water like a sponge and are light with a waffled texture, but don't put them in the dryer because it's supposed to ruin them.  I've been very happy with this product and would order it again.
B0013N483I|5|I could no longer find this mascara in stores and was tickled to find it on Amazon. It's my favorite because the comb separates and coats lashes fully.
B0092J7PQ2|4|Great set
B00HJDIAGC|5|This product is really works! I could see results already after my second using.  It is very easy for using also. The Whitening kits come with double tray. and it is very convenient and I can save my time. I have used this product for about a week now and I very like it.  A difference in the color before and now is very big. Few of my friends asked me already how I reached this results and what I did? And I recommend Kits for them!
B00008MOQN|4|was what it was .... no problems what so ever thanks for all your help...price is a little lower then the stores
9511181564|5|The smell is fantastic.  Good price for the amount.  Foamy.
B0012SE20S|4|I really like this trimmer. The light makes it super easy to us. I haven't nicked myself at all. The only issue is that it came with 2 5-day combs, and no 7-day comb. That is the one that would be best for my sideburns.  Anyway, I like it.
B00I531Q7U|5|i use this product 3 times a week overnight. This is the best lip mask ever, leaves my lips feeling baby smooth.
B000P9IEO0|4|My husband's dermatologist told him to keep his head covered to avoid further skin damage and/or skin cancer. Since he works at a car dealership, he is frequently outside and wearing a baseball cap or other head covering is not really an option. I did some research and found this product.  It used to be called Hair and Scalp Spray. This really does the trick for him. He sprays it on his head every day, and has not had any further issues to date. I highly recommend it, especially if you or the men in your life have a receding hairline or other thinning hair issue and need to use an SPF.
B001I6WT1S|4|Love the CF but the taste is NOTHING like bubble gum.
B00JBIP8H2|5|I love this product!!!!!  Awesome seller!
B00BB5YHEI|5|Works fine. As expected.
B001E96M94|5|The pack was a special price for my dear wife who enjoys this Johnson's Body Care Lotion much.  It has been hard finding it and seeing the package made her face light up when she received it.
B0006FRVP6|5|I have excema really bad in our dry inland northwest winters.  My fingertips crack & bleed.  I use a prescription hand creme on the cuts & use Burt's Bees Banana Hand Creme to seal in the prescription creme to make it more effective.  Plus, I really like the fragrance of the Banana Hand Creme.  It's just an excellent product for my needs and works well for my wife's hands, too.
B000V4SXW2|4|These barber scissors are sharp and cut hair very well--much better than our old pair that had a tendency to just push the hair aside. They also have a handy storage case (okay, so it's plastic) to protect the scissors in storage. It's the overall scissor length that is 6\\", so in some cases scissors with longer blades may work better.
B0040ZHUH2|4|This is an oil not a serum. I like the results very much but I don't like how oily it is. I've gotten into the habit of putting on a night cream (I use Andalou products) and putting the seriously firming serum just around my lips, eyes and neck. This keeps my pillowcase a little less oily. I do notice results using this. It does firm, but I notice it diminishing fine lines more.
B00DD479NG|5|im sorry this was ordered by my granddaughter and she loved it!!!
B000NL34JU|5|Nice highlighter pink. Used only about two spoon fills diluted with conditioner on my thick long hair. It hardly fades even with shampooing and hot water. Love love this pink dye
B004TD23W2|4|I like that the item is not so big that it is uncomfortable.  Easy to use.  A little expensive, though.
B005F5K1JA|5|I used this in Mexico when I was a child, I am using it now for my kids is tear free and they love it the smell is nice
B000RZPVV6|5|Who knew, right? I put a few squirts of it on my puppy's food in the morning. She licks it all up in no time! She loves the taste. I have seen a great improvement in her coat, it's very silky & soft and promotes a healthy tummy (she has some allergies & this has been great). My friend & her mom both use it for all their dogs as well. All different breeds & ages. Love it!
B0086DFRKG|4|This veil has very nice beading, and was much less than similiar veils at bridal stores. As described...good quality. Met expectations. Arrived in good time. I would recommend this seller to others.
B00FH692PQ|5|This is a great product. You will see a difference in the quality and fulness of your hair. I feel my hair thinning is significantly less and the hair texture has improved. Also is great treatment for your scalp. No more dandruff on shirt. The best thing is no toxic chemicals like other hair thinning treatments. A must for anyone with thinning hair.
B006GTKSHY|5|I absolutely love quality of Shany products... beautiful array of eyeshadow colors strongly pigmented; my only problem is I ordered several of these palettes in one purchase (to give them as gifts for some of my friends) and one of them came without lipsticks and concealers tray... on the other hand, looking at all 4 I bought, I can see they all came with completely different assortment of colors... not only eyeshadows but blushes too. It's a shame because quality is really awesome! I strongly recommend these products, I would just ask SHANY to take more care when packing them to keep standards and comply with description and photos published
B000GLRREU|5|After going to the dentist and finding out I had the start of gum disease, the hygienist recommended I get a water flosser.  I reviewed several on amazon.com and this one caught my eye.  I LOVE IT!  It has 10 water strengths and several different tips you can use with it.  I was never a diligent flosser but with this, I actually enjoy flossing my teeth.  I am amazed at the power in this little machine and how it can blast food out from between your teeth.  Hopefully at my next dentist visit they will notice a difference in my gums as well.  Very happy with this product!
B00NGYZIJK|5|Great. Just what I needed.
B00JEMRFIU|5|Works great! I have every sensitive skin and found this does not irritate my face.
B00IT1HKV4|5|The VoilaVe Argan Oil  arrived well packaged and in a timely manner.  It  has the same scent and absorbability as the argan oil I purchased in Morocco.  Mostly I use it on my face and chest.  Sometimes I mix it  with another product.  This is my second bottle of VoilaVe and I will reorder.<br /><br />RF<br />Raleigh, NC<br />Feb 15, 2015
B007BTXGM2|4|though its not long wearing, its finish is more of a semi gloss but leaves a bit of stain behind. very pretty medium deep rose violet color with sheen.
B003UKM9CO|5|I've been used to a normal toothbrush all these days....so it felt a bit weird when i started using an electronic one...but using it seems more efficient....
B00OFYHMMG|2|2 stars cuz shipping was fast, for the hair extension, not a full head piece, the color is more of a medium brown, not dark at all, and very thin, hard to clip into my hair
B00MBBQ8QQ|5|Love these color and quality. Hopefully they are 100 percent human. Fast delivery.
B001AOLZEU|5|I was expecting 1 big one, but got 2 of the regular size.  Smells and works just like the bottles I purchased from the Ulta in my town.<br /><br />Gives my fine/thin hair volume without making my hair HUGE.  Doesn't leave my hair sticky like some products.
B00MZLZ3OA|5|These work great with my dark strawberry blond hair
B0058DOCQM|4|I did not buy this exact hair tinsel, but most are good. This is a great price because if you have it professionally done, it costs $4-5. It's a bit hard to tie in, and if you do it right it should last about a month or more. There are many videos on the internet if you are having trouble.
B001ET77YI|5|My sons have sensitive skin and so they use this as body wash and really helps.  It was exactly what I wanted and came quickly.
B00GY5XVWY|5|love love love this stuff.  I originally got it because there was a coupon I thought it was a regular conditioner.  Works great though.  But I still use regular shampoo at least every 3 washes
B008GX8HQW|4|I love these colors but one needs a thic white base coat.
B00070E8LA|5|I had this product for a month and I love it. Good for prefect cuts and I recommend this product
B0031KNP12|5|My mom loves this!! and uses it daily.
B00M1E5F1W|5|great!
B00ADKVDM6|4|It's nice and pretty.  The only thing I dislike about it is the hair clip gets tangled in my hair.  It's one of those spring loaded pinch clips like the  kind beauticians use to hold back your hair.  It probably works fine for most people but I have very thick and easily tangled hair.<br /><br />One other thing, if you have cats beware -- one of my cats has it out for this hair clip.  She is incensed that this bird thing dare land on her human's head and she is determined to catch it and kill it..
B00LC3YWBW|5|Arrived on time and works great. The case to store it is very classy looking as well.
B0006M5566|5|I have been using this cream for a year now and it works pretty well for me. It makes my face look smoother and younger.
B005XY43IS|5|I have used this light 6-7 times now. it cures the gel nail lacquer perfectly. It's compact enough to pack in a suitcase, yet large enough to place all 4 fingers in at once. Great product so far.
B0042T07N0|5|Makes my verygross veins disappear!  Lasts quite awhile on & is waterproof. I use it on special occasions under my panty hose.
B004PKLY5Q|3|This is not my first set of sigma brushes and although the brushes are a good quality I must point out that this set did not come in the colors pictured in the item description.
B009I4PRI4|5|I use this in the morning and before bed, and my lips have never been better. In the winter, my lips crack and split and become very painful. I used this and in just a few days I noticed a huge difference! The smell is very light in my opinion. If you do not like the smell of roses, than the smell may bother you. I, like many people, have noticed that the tin can be a bit problematic. If the lid goes at an angle when taking it off, it gets stuck and you have to re-close it and try again. I have noticed I have to lift the lid straight up or I find myself fighting with it for longer than I would like to. They also make this in a tube which I am going to try as well.
B0016I3FQ6|5|Very nice feel and excellent quality.  These are also a very good size for personal use, one feature I like is the tip isn't too sharp incase you accidentally stab yourself :-) while trimming your self in the mirror.  Highly recommended.
B00D5TB1LK|1|Im.sure this product would be nice I'd I actually received it...
B00L4DHZ4G|4|I haven't been able to find anything better than these! I have naturally fine but chemically lightened hair which is now super dry & frizzy. This is the only shampoo/conditioner I have found that keeps my hair manageable, untangled and soft. I would love to find a more natural product that can give the same great results, but I've tried several with disastrous outcomes and keep coming to tresemme's keratin smooth combo.
B00S7DP2PU|5|Good product, if used with the right styling products.
B00II99E4I|5|Awesome!
B003ZPI1OY|5|Love this spray!
B000Z63TXE|5|I try a lot of products, always hoping to find THE best one.  I need frequent exfloiation, but amny products are too abrasive and others don't do a thing. This really delivered. It is gentle and yet, does a great job. I use it about 3 times per week and will continue to use this product.
B00F7QCRX0|5|MANY VITAMIN C PRODUCTS BREAK ME OUT THIS NEVER DOES!  IT HAS A GREAT TEXTURE AND BRIGHTENS MY SKIN!  LOVE IT!!
B001PUR1EM|5|I got started using this version of Oil of Olay's moisturizers when they changed one of their other sensitive skin formulas a few years ago. It was all for the best, because this is a very good moisturizer. It can be slightly greasy feeling, but you have to take the time to rub it in. That avoid 99% of the greasiness after-effects.<br /><br />I've found I still need something to help with redness, so I mix this with Eucerin Redness Reducing Moisturizer. 3-parts Oil of Olay, 2 parts Eucerin. Mix it in the palm of your hand, and it's a miracle facial moisturizer for those with sensitive skin and redness.
B005340GG6|1|All three sets I ordered of these for my grandson's wedding are not as pictured with the blueish lavender flowers. I received nails with silver glitter glued on the end. Not cool.
B00GI21PDK|5|I have a dark black hair, and this color just a little bit lighter than my hair, and it works so good.
B004Z209HS|5|The organic argan oil from Pura D'Or is wonderful, and lasts forever, as only a little drop is needed for anything from blemishes, scars, dry nails, and split ends.  I use it every day on my hair, and on my cuticles before going to bed (if I'm not too tired to remember).
B003UF0RB4|5|I've had pretty good skin all my life (sans some acne outbreaks on my face). I have never had hives, rashes or problems with perfumed body washers like Aveeno, Oil of Olay, Dove, etc., however, this past summer, I somehow got crazy eczema all over my arms.  After rounds of steroids, lotions and potions I finally got rid of everything in my shower and started over with sensitive skin stuff. I've always used the Cetaphil moisturizers (that I buy in bulk from my local warehouse store) but decided to give this body wash a go.  JIMMINY CRICKETS did this make a huge difference. My skin calmed down within a couple of days and I am now convinced that the body wash I was using beforehand somehow irritated my skin.  Now I'm on anti-histamines and a steroid cream, but the skin on the rest of my body feels great too.  I'm definitely repurchasing this over and over.
B00DTFFDJ6|5|Smells so good and strong..
B0015NZ6FK|3|First let me start by saying that this mask is a lot better than the average sleep mask.  It just was not what I expected.  I was looking for a mask that would 100% block out light from a TV and muffle the TV sound.  My husband watches the TV to fall asleep and I need it above all dark.  This mask DID block out all of the TV light however it did not muffle the sound and fit strange. It comes with a set of ear plugs for a reason I felt like I could hear everything with it on. Also I have a large head and I felt like this mask is really large so if you are a petite person this mask may be large on you.  It is a good mask I just believe my exceptions were set very high based on the reviews I read before purchase.
B000JS0X64|3|The hose that is supposed to drain the water out of the basin doesn't work; It constantly has a kink in it.  The manufacturer needs to rework that area.
B00IT1HKV4|5|Very nice product! Can't believe the immediate difference it made on my hair, skin and nails.
B000O2P21Q|4|Odd smell
B00776CLLG|5|no sunburns and my little one likes to help apply it.<br />last a few hours ( I do reapply after swimming though).<br /><br />Convenient bottle that can be locked so that it doesn't spray all over the inside of your diaper bag.
B0007CHJOG|1|I'm really disappointed with this product. Like many other people on here have said, IT BURNS! However, I only notice the intense burning feeling right after I shave, so I'm sure that could be a factor. But I've always been able to put deodorant on after I shave and it's never burned like this before. I've also noticed a slight discoloration of my armpits, so after about 5 days use I have stopped using it. It smells nice for a bit, but wasn't that effective as a deodorant to be honest...especially if you're moving a lot through the day.
B00RZNC98Q|5|I'm really impressed with Foxbrim! I've bought a few of their beauty products, now and they don't disappoint. This is a nice size bottle of organic rosehip seed oil. I love that it's cold pressed. Great value
B00AYR8BK0|3|compare to what i has before ，the bottom of hair to thin for me。 i feel like this product just so so
B000GHL1YG|5|I'm one of those people that was accosted at a mall kiosk and ended up buying some of this product line because the young woman selling it was a so sweet. (Yes, I'm a sucker for a sad story.)  I bought some body butter and the nail care kit (the nail gizmo really does work by the way).  It was way over priced and I didn't expect to ever use it.  Boy, am I glad I did!!  I was always embarrassed by the crepe-y looking skin on my arms.  I decided to try the body butter.  My skin just soaks up and looks awesome! It's not greasy either.  I was so encouraged, I started trying other products (from Amazon, of course. The mall price is ridiculous).  Over time, I've used the body butter, hand lotion, salt scrub, mud mask and the eye gel.  I can't say enough good things about them.  I'm 55, very fair complected and allergic to everything (and I mean everything!!)  Makeup, creams, lotions.. I can't even wear mascara.  But I can use this!  I've tried dozens of face and eye creams from Elizabeth Arden, Clinique, Clarins, Perricone MD, Exuviance and Murad (just to name a few).  Can't use them.  My eyes swell, I'm a mess.  That doesn't happen with this stuff.  Extra added bonus...it works! The eye gel is great.  You just need to dot the tip of your little finger in the gel and smooth it around your eye area.  It absorbs quickly and the jar lasts forever.  I use the mud mask once a week and am so excited about how it makes my face look.  It tightens up the pores and makes my skin look smooth and fresh.  The salt scrub has gotten rid of all those little bumps on my shoulders and legs.  It is pricy, but compared to some of the products I've tried and had to toss in a drawer, it's a bargain!  If you're sensitive to smells at all, don't try the Ocean Mist scented products.  They're a little strong.  The Milk and Honey scent is very nice and if you can still find the Vanilla, it's wonderful.  The Cucumber/Melon body cream is also nice. I plan on continuing to try the products one at a time.  I really hope they work as well for you as they have for me!
B0002XG9X2|5|If this product did not work for you, I am truely sorry! But, for me, this is a miracle!! I highly recommend it based on the following and what type of skin I have.<br />My skin is oily, and breaks out occasionally but no matter what I do I have blackheads.  I steam and clean it every day. I don't wear makeup most days yet the blackhead s are there.<br />I popped this gadget out of the box ascsoon as I got it, just taking it for a test run. My expectations were not high based on reviews.<br />I was in shock when I turned it on, and after using a few minutes noticed the cap filling with a white/gray goo from my pores. My blackheads were being sucked out. I checked the mirror,  it seemed so. Just to be sure I rinsed the cap out then tried again. Same result. Maybe its because I steam my face often or my skin is so oily that it worked. But it did! Some things to note, the water tank is tricky to fill. Use only filtered water for it to prolong its life. It sprayed me right in the eye first go. It has one suction setting which is more than adequate but is funneled by using the smaller end. The mist definitely helped it stick to my face. In some places it did not stick as well, like my chin, but it worked. You need to move it up or down or in circles to get full effect. I would buy again and if you don't like it return it. Also there are knock offs so make sure its panasonic american. I would not buy tge japanese one as it may not fit American outlets  and has not been u.l. tested.
B008LDFU26|5|Ive been using Nerium for a few years now and love it.  In the first few months I notice the fine lines disappearing and my skin tightening which is a miracle at age 52.  The down side is that after awhile it stops working, so I go off of it for a month or two and then come back.  This seems to capture the good results again.  I adore this product but do wish it kept on working.  I guess there is always a negative, still this product does deliver
B001OGKYL4|3|:)
B008TC2Y7S|5|Great thinning shears.  These are sharp so watch your fingers.  The rubber rings inside are nice as they won't slip in your fingers.  Good price for a quality product.
B00JTY6WQ4|5|I had never used a derma roller before this and wish I had known more as to what it was before agreeing to review it. The derma roller comes in a clear case. The case is of superior quality and it appears that no expense was spared in its creation. This case is what keeps you from accidentally pricking yourself with several little needles.<br /><br />After doing a bit of research (even though instructions were included), I understood that I was to roll this along my face seemingly to open the skin. I did just that but wasn't comfortable with it. My review process was quick. I did not capture video of this specific item as I have others but if a derma roller is what you're looking for this is definitely it. Be very careful when it comes to the roller needles. They are far from dull.<br /><br />*Product sent for purposes of review
B007A4L7II|5|this is a mild yet modern color.  I use a larger blush brush instead of the small one they supply.
B0046VGPHQ|5|Works amazing!!! Never paying for a spray tan again!!
B000NSRX2M|2|I order this product so that I can have perfect eyebrows. I made sure the skin was clean and free of oil and placed the strip where it belongs. I am not sure if they sat in the warehouse too long but it didn't grip the hairs and it didn't remove anything. I eventually gave up and went to a salon to have my eyebrows done.
B00M0D7XPK|1|I thought this would be more like a nicely-scented liquid to enhance my home or something in a spray bottle, since that's what's pictured. However, what I got was a hard plastic bottle full of an unscented thick lotion that I have no IDEA how to use!<br />What am I supposed to do with this stuff? There's only an ounce so I can't add it to many products and the scent is virtually non-existent so I'm at a loss.<br />What do you other buyers do with this stuff??
B001JJ8B52|2|This toothpaste has good consistency as Crest usually does.  However, it leave a strange taste in the mouth and after taste that is not good.  I'm not sure if it's the Pro-Health part of it or the Whitening part of it, but I would not pay for the Pro-Health Whitening mint gel toothpaste, and would recommend a different type.
B002WJOOIQ|4|I got a beautiful color from this lotion, but the only thing I didn't like was how kind of greasy it felt at first. Other than that, everything was great, including the smell, and the color I got from one week alone. Especially for the price.
B000KQ9302|5|Great quality and prompt delivery.
B000BF1396|5|This product always works.
B00BP5DFL0|1|This item will cut the hair and not pull it from the root. I would not recommend.
B0047S9VEC|3|I was pleased with my brushes when they arrived, they are soft unlike some brushes I've used. Shipping was fast and I have no complaints.
B00NDOYT9I|5|The tape is much smaller than expected, and takes a bit of practice to work with, but it came weeks before the date it said it would come so that gives it 5 stars
B00JS9FMO8|5|Plant Therapy is my favorite supplier for essential oils. My research told me they are a good company, and their products and prices are great!
B005IP67EA|4|Holds pretty good; better than the others I have tried.  I like that it doesn't have a fragrance as well
B00336EUTK|5|Saw the differences after just 3 uses, it's amazingg ! totally worth every cent
B00261QVIQ|4|Good
B00891EQTI|4|one of the bottles had opened and the smell of cedar on opening the package was overwhelming. that said, the first two perfumes were really lovely together and smelled great on me. Although I could do without a broken product, I would use the perfume again in a heartbeat.
B0030ZRSHK|5|I have tried the hard wax and honey wax. The hard wax is MUCH easier to use. You don't need strips. I do recommend using the pre waxing oil liberally as this is hard to clean up
B00NXDV4WE|5|This stuff works wonderful. It keeps my skin moisturized and feeling great
B001FB5I96|5|love it!!!!
B003VL3SG8|5|I love this product and buy it constantly. The sparkling and conditioning for the skin feels and looks great.
B00K0C8I8O|5|Little kittens oh so adorable and came so fast. This seller price was affordable i like the price and i bought. Came in time for hallow, hallowen, But i wont use them all i save some for other designs and wear with some bling blings.lots of it.yep have fun .these are cool.
B001F51T3Q|5|This is a product that I use everyday of my life. The price for this pack of 2 was very good, and it arrived in just a couple of days.
B000S8JB36|3|It has a super strong fan but isn't very hot.
B00B5Y2MME|3|Haven't seen any difference as yet.  Hoping it lives up to its promises because it wasn't cheap.  will continue to use.  It rubs in well though and does not stain clothes.
B000WYZ9Q4|5|This thick, dark mascara is really perfect! I only wear it on special occasions because it is so dramatic that everyday use is a little silly- and I mean that in the best possible way. This doesn't crumble or crack and the look is comparable to wearing false eyelashes.
B00KHUY4TQ|5|Nice product!
B005HNXJ62|5|I bought Soap & Glory Hand Food hand cream because I heard on a video blog that it smelled awesome. I wasn't expecting to love it so much. It does smell nice, not too overpowering, and it is not greasy at all. I will be buying this hand cream again and I am planning on buying more products from Soap & Glory.
B00BUQXMIK|1|Used the whole box. Nothing.
B00EUDQL10|5|It was perfect!
B00140ZLXQ|5|Wife likes it and whatever makes me happy makes me happy too.
B009IDR00S|5|This is a very good hair piece I use it to put my hair back. I put my hair in a ponytail and then put this on and it looks great like I have my bangs braided! :)
B0049LUI9O|5|very good
B001GJ0E6E|5|The product received is exactly as advertised, the product arrived on schedule, the product came well packed and everything worked out. When I have to buy will choose this vendor again.
B000H30FGY|4|This product is really nice but works better on finer or chemically relaxed hair textures.  It’s light, creamy, and non-greasy.  If you have really thick and course hair or non-relaxed African American hair, you may need to mix this with the molding wax to get your hair to really lay down.
B00538TSMU|1|Eyelashes are poorly packaged in a box that  was shipped crushed. The eyelashes are poorly made, but you get what you pay for.
B003TQPRGY|5|good
B0015R5FGG|4|This is a really lovely, pure milk chocolate perfume oil.  The funny part is the way it varies on the people I know -- On me it smells like brownies baking in the oven, and on my friend it smells like milk chocolate.  If you like food-scented perfume, (not with a food note, but actually smelling like *food*) this is a good one for you.  It has decent throw and lasts at least a few hours.      The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is that I usually don't like to wear food-scented perfume - I can't wear it without getting hungry. :)
B0048HV4O2|5|The coverage worked great and left my hair soft
B000P22TIY|5|For the price, this is fantastic. I love it because it lasts for more than a few hours like so much of the other watered- down junk that is so readily available!
B0077CNO1G|5|So easy to work with, i have seen the effects on the skin, that is the reason why i purchased it, the tips are made of glass, so easy to clean with careful. it does what it suppose to do. i like it, i love it. and excellent price.!!!
B000PT9BVU|5|I never had bad acne growing up, as an adult, all those years have caught up with me.  Adult acne like a mutha.  But, this soap actually cleans up my skin (squeaky) and leaves it looking rosy and fresh.  I wear it as a mask at night (about 2 - 5 minutes) and then use it as a normal wash in the morning.  The smell alone would do it for me.  The feel of it is even better.  This soap is great for everyday use and doens't dry the skin at all!
B00IAZTJ9U|5|took a bit of getting used to since a lighter touch is required but the size makes it the only one that works for me.  Still have to work at keeping the sponge in the holder.  I hope that gets figured out soon.
B006Z96OBY|1|Doesn't remove acne like other ones I've bought before
B00K4PLC30|4|Love it.  I use it on both my face and hair but mostly for my face.  My daughter use it on her hair.  My face feels soft and smooth waiting to get results on the wrinkle on my forehead.  My daughter loves it for her hair.  Happy to recommend this productl
B005HO0AR2|5|As expected
B00763LZF8|1|I had previously purchased a different style of Oral-B dental floss gadgets which I was quite happy with. Then I ordered these and have used, or tried to use, them for a few days now. They are awful. They break at the slightest pressure. I rarely leave poor reviews, but I find myself frustrated in this case. These things are uncomfortable to use and way too fragile. I strongly urge you to find an alternative.
B001KL0RGU|4|Beautiful color but there is not very much at all in the tube! I don't use it every day and there is almost nothing left. It is mousy rising and not perfume- I just wish the content was more :(
B0054Y3M5W|5|This polish is sheer for those looking for a sparkle on their nails.  Dont expect coverage.  It came in a timely manor.
B00F07JDCE|1|I got toe nail nails instead. NOT AT ALL HAPPY. They did issue me a refund.
B001G56LN8|5|Definitely a high end, classy hair accessory that will last me decades. It's more expensive, but it's worth the money and it looks amazing in comparison to the cheap (and bad) generic ones you get at Walgreens, CVS or Walmart. And finally something that's NOT made in China. I have long, thick hair and it holds all my hair in a nice ponytail. I have already ordered one barrette and one clip from France Luxe and have worn them with great confidence. They look amazing!!! Highly recommended if you're tired of your cheap product that breaks easily.
B003ATS2QC|5|I like this scale because it's thin & can be stored easily just about anywhere.  I like that you don't have to tap it to turn it on, you just step on, it tells you your weight, then it turns off. It goes to the tenth of a pound, which is nice.  It's pretty simple - exactly what I need.  It also takes AAA batteries instead of those hard-to-find watch batteries, which is a huge convenience.  Overall, it is much better quality than I'd expected for the price.
B00CQGUSZ8|5|Good looking hair.
B00OP20WR0|2|I was chosen to try this product compliments of Vidal Sassoon. I have used several different brands of at home coloring for my hair for years. I have started going to the salon to have my hair colored to get it more even and less damage. I will continue to go to the salon. This was not an easy process. Too much mixing involved. The color came out darker than I expected, but looked nice overall. I did have some damage to my hair. It feels really dried out and crunchy in spots. I followed the directions and used the conditioner as instructed. I will not purchase this product in the future due to the damage in my hair.
B00C0UQRHS|5|Received these from my mother-in-law years ago and have been hunting for them ever since. Now my husband has decided he loves them also and I only had one left. Found them here. Thank You!<br />Jan
B00OQAXOTE|1|Got it fine. The littlest amount dabbed and blended on my cheeks made me look like a circus clown. Very, very bright and not a flattering color.
B00243FM9K|1|Its unfortunate that this is the only 2% benzoyl peroxide product available at drug stores.  The consistency is just awful.  It reminds me of relish that comes in those plastic squeeze tubes.  And it just doesn't work. I put this on and my skin keeps breaking out.  No bueno and would not recommend.
B000V70MWS|5|I get cracks in my hands and feet and this stuff really works in solving it.  It is virtually scent free and rubs in well.
B008XWC3UM|5|These brushes are great for nail designs and for detailing paintings. I use these all the time. I don't know what I'd do without them!
B0033ZE3Y8|5|was fun while it lasted.... i dont wear this make up anymore
B002I05I7K|5|WHen you have thin hair like mine and your tring to do everything possible to help your hair look its best, This is the product to use! HANDS DOWN, Thank you for whoever created this line of beauty products!
B000JKT4WQ|5|LOVE IT! I just received it in the mail today and can't wait to start using it. I've tried on all the colors already and they look fabulous!
B000C2374M|5|i went on other reviews as far as the scent, i really like it, for an artist he surley has great perfumes
B008DK9S4S|5|I love roses and I love this lotion.  I received it very quickly and am very pleased;<br />I recommend this item to anyone who loves roses and moisturizing.
B00BAYWOFY|4|I dropped my Tweezerman tweezers and bent the tips, so I decided to give these a try since they're half the price. They feel the same in my hand but I think the tips just aren't quite as fine as they are on the Tweezermans. The difference is really negligible though so I think these are a better value and would purchase these again.
B000GG1944|5|I love this product. It stops my breakage and makes my hair soft and smooth. My only complaints are that it is difficult to find in stores and that you pay a lot for small amount.
B0000AS54S|5|You cannot go wrong with UDDERLY anything. All of their skin products are wonderful. I am so thrilled with the last cream with urea for my son, I am now not going to use anything else.<br />I also had no problems with shipping or the packaging. It all went fine.<br />You will love these skin products. They are so silky and absorb so sweetly.<br />Enjoy your new soft skin.
B000KND8IS|4|kind of expensive
B001MA0QY2|5|I purchased this flat iron through Amazon and received it in less than a week. This is an easy to handle flat iron that heats up quickly and does a great job straightening.
B00ICO4F3Y|5|I especially love this for my eyebrows. Having a scar from when I was little it was just part of me and accepted. Never really thought about missing hair in my eyebrow until now. My brows are more full and the scar that was easily seen is gone. Yes, I said gone! This is a must if you want full brows and lashes!
B00BB8ZIQQ|1|Useless.  The clips melted onto my hair immediately.  No hair setter at all is a better hair setter than this.  Use hairspray and Velcro rollers, you will be much happier with the result.
B00M1SUW7K|4|First time using mustache wax. I have a very bushy mustache and this really helps keep it under control, giving it a nice shape instead of the bristly mess it can be. The smell is mainly beeswax and slightly sweet. Just soften it between your fingers for a few seconds before you apply it and comb. Easy-peasy.
B0052D4416|3|I had to put chap stick on underneath of it because 2 mins into wearing the product and  it cracks in the crevice of the lip making it look weird and like youre dead. I have tried this on multiple people chapstick seems to fix that. But a very nice color
B007Q0WW0S|4|I like that It's lightweight and doesn't weigh my fine hair down but it does not provide the shine I was expecting.
B000YTF7QO|3|I do love the color in this headband, but I thought it would be actually knit with different colored threads. It's more of a thin, dyed cloth. I had an initial problem with the seller, but it was resolved to my satisfaction, so I would order again.
B00JPCNL6Y|3|Ok
B003V5O5HU|4|A friend gave this to me as a gift.  I liked it so much that I gave one bottle to a friend and kept the other for my use.
B00BPMTZF8|3|Very moisturizing, but definitely leaves my face like an oil slick. I pretty much only use it on my lips and hands now, but even when I use it on my hands, the product takes so long to absorb that it gets all over my keyboard and mouse when I use it at work. I suggest dampening your hands in the bathroom and using only a very small amount on wet skin. Absorbs more quickly and hydrates longer. Decent ingredients though!
B000UK2W4C|5|I've had various Sonicare toothbrush models over the last 10 years or more. It has been my experience that this brand continues to improve with each new model. I've loved every Sonicare toothbrush I've owned, this being my favorite so far. Once you've used a Sonicare a few times I cannot imagine going back to a regular toothbrush, nor any other electric toothbrush. My husband and I are both big coffee and tea drinkers, and every time we are complimented on our teeth I attribute it to our Sonicare toothbrushes. We don't use whitening toothpastes or any other whitening products, but we do both use our Sonicare 2-3 times a day. On the rare occasion that I've been without my Sonicare I'm always shocked by how dirty my gums and teeth feel after brushing alone. It's more noticeable the next morning after brushing with a regular brush instead of the Sonicare. My mouth feels much cleaner when I wake up after having brushed with the Sonicare the night before. The UV cleaner is fairly fast and I think it's worth the investment. I still have all 4 of my wisdom teeth and so I like the compact brush heads vs. the standard b/c they can effectively clean the backs of my wisdom teeth which are usually hard to get to. One word of warning for those who haven't used a Sonicare before: be careful not to slip up and press the power button before you get the toothbrush head into your mouth or you'll end up with toothpaste everywhere!
B00016XJ4M|5|I ordered this for a sunburn since witch hazel and aloe are best for sunburns. Applied 3x a day for about a week just by dumping it in my hands and patting on the burn. I didn't peel, so I'd consider that a success. It also helps with the itching associated with sunburns. If you start to itch, it's time to douse yourself again.<br /><br />If you're using it on a sunburn you don't want to peel, only take SHORT showers with cool water. Staying in the shower longer than you absolutely must will cause the skin to lift and peel. Also, avoid anything but the mildest soaps and NO scrubbing, itching, rubbing or anything that will weaken the delicate skin. Good luck<br /><br />I'm not really a fan of the rose scent, but it wasn't very strong and went away quickly.
B009MYO1NC|5|Product: this is more like a leave in conditioner that's how I describe it.  I use it when I comb my daughter's hair after her bath.  She has curly hair (just curly at the ends) and she doesn't complain much.  However if you want a quick fix let's say like when you need to style hair this is heavy, for that purpose I prefer something lighter,even more &#34;watery&#34; like the suave detangling spray.  I was so happy to get this item 2 months ago as part of the subscribe and save program for under $3.00 and now it's not available anymore through this program and now one single bottle is more than $10.00!!!  Problem is that I can't find it in any store near by me.  By the way I love the scent.  It stays on my daughter's hair even the next day.  Please subscribe and save bring it back!
B00C0I80OS|5|I love this sunscreen. I started using it years ago by recommendation of a doctor after having nose surgery and have used it ever since for my face, neck and chest only. I've never had any issues with it (it's not greasy, but at the same time it stays on if you sweat or go in the water).<br />I was surprised to receive my order so soon since it was shipped from Greece, but it only took one week to arrive. It even came with a free gift. Thank you! I would definitely recommend this seller.
B000GLRREU|5|I really love this waterpik and my dentist said my teeth looked much better, after I started using it. Very easy to set up and use.
B0009XPAAS|1|Despite the good ratings, I ended up with massive raccoon eyes with this mascara.  Would not recommend.
B00BV5EZJK|5|I am very happy with my purchase. Hair feels salon finish after each use.  Looks shiny and feels light.  I love it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this brand.
B008VFW66M|5|Love Love Love Opi. Great consistency, easy to apply, professional finish and very long lasting. Put a top coat on.
B0032VJBRC|5|With blond colored hair that is thin to begin with, this product keeps my hair from looking like dried out wisps of straw. love it!
B004G8TRLU|5|This product arrived quickly to my home and it works wonderfully. It scrapes all the left overs on the tongue without much applied pressure. Easy and simple to clean.
B00006IV2D|1|Even on the highest setting, it didn't heat up enough to curl my hair.  I usually have good luck with Conair products, but I returned this one.
B00GMAWI66|5|I used the Argan Oil on both my skin and my hair and both have given me successful results. My skin has never felt softer and my hair has never felt healthier. The one issue I have with it is that washing it out of my hair was a bit more time consuming than other products I have used in the past. Other than this, I would recommend it to others.
B005BH0QIS|5|I received it very very soon after I ordered it. It is very soft and elegant. I got my dream veil. Thank you Velvet Bridal!
B0039K40PY|5|I never see pkg like this before. My mother like it. Easy to use and will never break out while opening.
B004N1EQNO|4|Great Shampoo, smells nice, and doesn't leave hair oily. Highly recommend.
B000AQF50Y|5|I was very pleased with my experience. My order arrived in the appropriate time frame and intact. I will definitely recommend this merchant to others.
B00D5NGMZG|5|I have been using this for over 5 years and love it. Prickly heat is the best in keeping you dry and fresh feeling.
B004KS2LK0|5|Loved it
B002TK7GAQ|5|Great
B004VN31JO|3|Product ordered was in multiples, none were exactly the same... First rack In mint condition, however scratches from abrasives n blemishes in the acrylic in the next two.
B008R1GPZ8|5|When I received this product is was everywhere.....I even initially asked for a refund.....my significant other who refuses to throw anything anyway capture most of it and got it back in the jar........I didn't want to touch it......so I used it.....dry hair......wet hair.....whenever and for whatever :).......is allowed to be successfully and comfortably pull my natural hair up and the spiral curls  that hung at the back were not hard nor crusty( other Curl Custards results).....there is no flaking, no hardness ergo no ends shattering......they just have to get the packing corrected..............
B005LP5AA4|5|The product really does work. I've done 2 wraps and have lost 5 inches! Would recommend this product to anyone!
B002D48QV6|2|My esthetician recommended that I use Avene Cicalfate Cream after I had a mild chemical peel to minimize redness.  She gave me a sample tube and I absolutely fell in love with it!  I wanted to get a good deal on a full-size tube, so I checked on Amazon.  When I saw the discounted price compared to other websites, I thought it was a good deal.  Well, you definitely get what you pay for!<br /><br />The tube I received was sealed, but when I punctured the seal, a whole bunch of water leaked out!  I thought maybe I needed to shake the tube, but it didn't help.  I just heard more water sloshing around!  By the time I squeezed all of the residual water out, there was only about 1/3 of the actual cream left!  I definitely should have tried to return this product, but waited too long!<br /><br />I recommend ordering this product from Dermstore or another reputable company.  It may cost a few dollars more, but you actually get a full tube of quality product!
B002A0JG9Y|5|This product adds elasticity to my hair which stops breakage. It feels clean, not heavy and leaves a healthy shine. Highly recommended!
B002DYCUW2|4|As a woman that has dandruff and has colored hair, I cant express how happy I was to stumble across this shampoo! It hasn't gotten rid of my dandruff all together BUT it has helped a lot and leaves my hair feeling tons softer than any other dandruff products Ive tried!
B00GLEK9DW|4|I bought Viva vitamin C by chance when i was looking for facial serum, i gave it a try, and just about 2 weeks, my acne looks more better right away. I think vitamin C helped a lot for my face, i recommend it from then
B005KO7NK6|4|I ordered it hoping for a light/medium brown wig like how the pictures were. However, I received a dark brown colored wig, which is not much of a change for my naturally black colored hair. I would've given 3 stars, but then it came along with a free necklace and free wig cap, so i guess it makes it up a little bit? Besides the color issue, its not bad.
B00PUYEQLA|5|I am really satisfied with this product!! You can feel it working and will definitely buy again.
B00NY820SA|1|I hated this mascara so much! It smudged after a few hours, sticky formula and gave my spider lashes. Does not build well at all. You literally have to apply coats back to back and they still end up a mess. I've used all kinds of different mascaras over the past 20 years and this was by far the worst. The only reason I gave it one star was because zero wasn't an option. Save your money and buy Lancôme Hypnose Drama instead.
B00ESXJMBI|1|I purchased the trimmers based on the aprox. scale shown in the ad.<br />The finger holes are so small the scissors are impossible for me to use.
B002N5XWMS|5|Best smelling Poopourri! And it works!
B002IT10P0|5|This powder liner can be messy, but with careful application makes a stunning impact.    I utilized instructional videos on YouTube for more information on the correct application method, which was very helpful.    This is meant to go on the waterline of your eyelid.    Burgundy is my favorite...I have green eyes, and this color really makes them shine!
B003YJ9YBU|5|This face cleanser is amazing. I'm on my second bottle and I absolutely see a difference in my skin.
B00S33TVPQ|5|Great results.
B00GYB13NM|4|Sometimes, I get a slight burning sensation on my face when I use this. Otherwise, I like it.
B003J9R50W|5|Well made and so easy to use.  I hope to get another set for a spare. For those of us who love taking hot showers for which we pay with an itchy dry back, this miracle set is the answer.  Great, well made product.
B00N9DL9SW|5|I ordered this and the eye cream from Andre Lorent, and I have to say...his products ROCK! Actually some products that deliver real results FINALLY! I have immediately noticed the cellulite on my thighs improve, and I honestly haven't had it very long yet. I think with continued use this may be my Holy grail product for fighting cellulite. I have tried other cellulite fighting products in the past much longer, and not been able to achieve the results I already have with this.Have to say as a side note, I LOVE the Andre Lorent eye cream as well. I had not heard of Andre Lorent before a friend of mine introduced me to it, and with how good I look and feel with his products so far..I am so shocked this has not gotten more attention. Well Andre Lorent, you have certainly made a believer out of me, consider me a lifetime customer, VERY pleased!
B007ZUB17O|5|This lotion is probably my favorite of all time in the history of The Body Shop. It is a very strong smell, being a little more musky than even the musk/sandalwood of Midnight Bakula, if you've ever smelled that, so it's a very woodsy, lingering scent. I'm disappointed that I can no longer purchase it at the store, but I was happy with this because it is a comparable price to the retail at the store itself. I was pretty happy overall and recommend it to anyone who likes scents such as TBS's Midnight Bakula, sandalwood, musk and incense.
B00B0G0FOO|1|It arrived empty..had leaked into the box  Its hard to rate something that is not there  dont know how to get credit for it
B00KC2H51S|1|I've bought from amazon n never had any problem or be disappointed until I bought this item. I was so disappointed. It wasn't worth it.
B002SZPNJ8|5|It works well over your own hair and looks real.
B00CUG270S|5|What in ingenious idea!  I love this...so much more comfortable than regular flossing!
B00B22BCJS|5|Great!!
B005TI7LB4|4|It cleanses the skin,but it strips the skin a little too much and leaves the skin a bit tight.Not very moisturizing but cleanses well.It is necessary u follow up with a moisturizer. All in all its a great balance between clean and not overly dry and tight
B00NPX42JE|5|I was more than happy with the product<br />Deliverd on time
B003HCYFYA|5|I purchased this with the face wash the company sells and they work so well together. It goes on light not greasy and helped with dry patches on my skin but didn't make me feel extra oily and greasy. It has a nice light scent not too overpowering at all and works well on my sensitive skin.
B00ARF44O6|5|Excelent product. Excelent service. Thanks.
B001KYVUR2|5|This stuff is absolutely amazing.  I have been struggling with my fine textured curly hair for my entire life (35+ years!) and finally found a product that is moisturizing enough that does not build up or weigh it down.  This stuff truly rocks!!
B00J3K9W6G|3|Not the fault of the vendor.  I was expecting this to be a longer arm.  My fault for not better researching it.
B004AIAUJE|5|Coming back on  shelves in May 2015!!😃
B0013MTHWQ|5|Love this razor. I don't know who else has a problem when they shave over their knees but I always end up cutting myself. Not anymore with this razor though! The head of the razor is very flexible and glides right over the curves of your legs and under arms! Definitely recommend this product to everyone!
B003YJCR50|5|OMG!  These are sharp.  I wish I could strop my razor to this level.  Feather makes the best blades.
B00RFM5984|5|I ordered last Friday and received them today. No shedding at all. I pulled the bristles on each brush and received no shedding. No harsh smell. Each one individually wrapped. I received 20 brushes no duplicate's. These are nice starter brushes. Will I order again? Most definitely. This is my initial review upon receiving them. Have not used these yet.
B001RU999U|5|I absolutely loooove this lotion. Leaves your skin feeling and looking great and smelling amazing!
B00HA0SN7A|1|I hate this product literally
B004FP9NHC|5|I actually got crushed plastics when I odered. But the seller contact me and sent me an right one.It is bit smaller than I expected and the color of the product is not that vivid like a picture above.But still, it is very pretty.
B00H56KCUU|4|Probably my favorite primer - even better than my smash box one. To the people saying this is greasy, TRY using small amounts ONLY in the places your pores are biggest and need to be most primed. If you use too much, your face is bound is feel greasy. This is a great primer when you work with it the right way.
B0000531GA|5|I love these. For under my eyes.<br />But difficult to find locally. Great price
B007124J9I|5|This was a gift for teenage niece. She loves it! She says it is easy to use & clean.
B00ELNDKUY|4|WEN is brilliant and I actually like this scent (though it is really strong!), but that this flavor is sort of a brown/off red in color. I'm a light platinum blonde and I do think it has a toning effect on my hair.
B003PWHWN8|3|I bought this product and when I received the seal was broken and a quarter of the content was lost !!!<br />So disappointed !!
B004XJ98DO|3|It apply well but for me I could use a bit more moisture.
B004GVDYCU|5|Received it. Great product. Price is bit higher than what I usually pay.
B008NXMP4U|5|One of the best shaves ever....  The Bloc Osma is great for nics.  The shaving brush can be better, but for this price it's great.
B0009XPA2G|5|I love this mascara, especially for the brush and comb built in. Even after the mascara is gone, the brush and comb will remain in my makeup bag or purse.
B00K2SC2L0|5|Great soap.love it.fast shipping
B00MAQW04Q|5|Met expectations
B0033VVJSK|2|Didn't smell as much like bananas as I was hoping. It's much more purfumey then fruity. It conditioned okay, not great. Probably would not buy it again. I have very thick curly hair and the bottle does not last long at all for me.
B001S4O5RG|4|This lotion has such a great smell.  It is almost good enough to eat!<br />It seems to be very moisturizing too. Unfortunately, the container had broken during shipping, but it was well worked out in the end.
B00L6Q96ZM|5|This is a wonderful product!
B00CHHKHY8|5|Worked perfectly, smells great
B001S2PLNK|5|They do rip if you are not careful. I haven't ripped one but I could see it happening. I've had the same one for over a year and three brush head changes. What I do is spray a little isopropyl alcohol inside the cover and then slide it on the brush.  I keep some iso in a spray bottle and use it for cleaning various stuff around the house. These are overpriced but I'd have no problem buying another set when needed. Its so nice not having the nastyness build up in the brush.
B0054GBXOW|5|So I purchased this product about 2 weeks ago after seeing this video on you tube by some african american girl. I have only been using it for about a week. I use it twice a day as recommended once during the day and once at night. So far I do see some results my skin looks a bit clearer and lighter and a plus that I may add is, I no longer wear deodorant as this gel serves as one very clean. A lot of the reviews say it takes time so I will continue to use it until I get maximum results. After a month I'm sure I will see a major difference. So excited!!!!<br /><br />So I decided to wait a couple of more weeks before I revised my review, well let me tell you its been about almost 1 month and 2 weeks since i have been using this product and the results are amazing(used it on underarms). At first I was very skeptical just like most of us are, but I thought hey what do I have to loose if it doesn't work...right? well the little darn gel did its job, my underarms are so nice and white now they no longer have the patchy gray shadow they had from so many harsh deodorants and shaving. Even my family noticed and said wow what a difference!!!!! If you are a female going through this problem I highly recommend it!!!!!! It takes time but it works! don't get discourage seriously....after just one week I almost gave up but, I am so glad I didn't it takes time and patience and using the product right.
B00803YSRA|3|If you only want nails for a day then this is the product for you although even in just a day I doubt their solidity.  The sticky stuff does not set up well.  And to be honest I like to have my nails looking nice for more than a day at a time.  Who has time to do their toenails every day?
B004F563CK|5|Everything worked, it met my expectations and I want to thank you E-onsale Deluxe tattoo kit, the product was wonderful.
B003SSTL42|1|I don't know who these &#34;reviewers&#34; actually are but this product is only for people who want to waste their money. It's not even good for feet let alone your face. The material that you'll see rubbing off is the balls melting from the heat/friction action. Try at home peels that use actual exfoliant acids with a name you trust.
B001AKJFBO|5|This was a gift for a friend and she loved it.  Small, compact and the color choices were perfect for her.
B0062GZ27W|5|It's a little darker than my skin tone (kinda hard to tell what color to choose on a computer screen), but not enough to matter.  It warms up my face quite a bit, which is great.  And it covers up everything SOOOOO well, so I'm gonna use this same product in the future, though in a lighter shade.
B005U8DZ4A|2|I've tried different tongue brushes over the years, and so I wanted to try this one because it's something new and has a fun appeal to it. I finally gave in to buy this one at Walmart - it was a nice bright orange color. Let's just say that's $4.50 I won't see again, and I'm not happy about that. The bristles on this brush are pointy but flimsy and short with picking up tongue debris. I had to keep repeating the sweeping motions because I didn't see enough debris being picked up (and u can see it because it grabs it on the top), and then it made my tongue bleed from all that! I used it twice and threw it out. I'm back to using my Tungbrush. It picks up more debris, comfortably and quickly. (I've found that it does a good job in controlling bad breath WHEN you incorporate in a program of brushing ur teeth with a essential-oil added tooth soap like Uncle Harry's.) Once or twice a year Big Lots has single tungbrushes at about half price or less - In my book, $5 is too much to pay for ANY single tongue brush.
B00K233NGS|5|I have to get just the right amount to avoid weighing hair down.
B001V9MQAQ|5|I had an ingrown toenail removed when I was in junior high school. A small portion of it still Groselle and these are the only clippers that I can find to Trema
B00DTH2CDO|2|Came damaged & brushes are not set in bottle properly!!<br />One of the bottles had leaked for the money I paid!!
B00AREI3BC|5|GREAT PRODUCT - QUALITY AND PRICE - WE BOUGHT AGAIN !  A +
B004AYUW8C|5|I love CK One , excellent price , I recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks!!
B000FS05VG|5|very smooth and efficient.  the sound level is good and it works great.
B008R54IQM|3|good
B0017JT8G0|5|These bars of soap are really big! So big, in fact, that you need the cord to keep from dropping them. On the upside, the large size makes for a bar that will last several weeks. Also, the fragrance of the soap is excellent, producing a manly scent that is not too overpowering, but clean smelling. Although a bit pricey for soap, I would recommend.
B00RZNC98Q|5|I love rose hip oil it is the best. I received this to review and I love the quality.
B002GP62KY|1|I ordered them at the end of last spring semester for my aunt. Now it is end of the world, I will not expect to receive them any more.
B00HMS1GE2|3|I liked very good
B002CEV1W8|5|I first bought this product just to try it out since it was so expensive to get a keratin treatment in a salon. I have used this product for more then a year and a half now. I have my cousin do my treatment every 4 months and my hair looks GREAT. It really eliminates the frizz especially on humid and rainy days. Make sure to use the proper shampoo and coniditioner because it actually makes it last for about 4 months. Make sure not to saturate the hair all you need is a little bit. I have done it about 4 or 5 times already and it's only half way done. I would definitely recommend this and well worth it.
B00DEPPWRE|5|Didn't disappoint!  Loved my California Tan! I will definitely order this product again !
B002PQ8BQM|1|This product gave me a very irritating red rash in my underarms and only prevented sweat for about one day.
B00IS8PLFA|4|Is this mic on?Right firstly it smells great. The Axe kilo was spot on. Now for the pheromones part. It does work. You also get the boost of confidence when you approach a woman. The only drawback is that you have to spray it periodically. Sometimes you have to let it off a few days but it does work. Try mixing and matching the true pheromone oil products and the spray. I literally got grabbed,phone number and quite a few stares. Be charming works but the spray helped alot.
B002WTCK4Q|1|People with grinding problems like myself oftentimes bite down hard while sleeping.  As a result my nerve below my teeth has been bothering me for days.  I may end up with root canal.  This is a terrible device and a terrible design. I should have thought about it before.  It puts all the pressure on one molar on other either side of your mouth. I'm going to try the biogrind device next.  Surely there must be something that works.  This Dentek device is a nightmare!
B00005JS5C|5|Other men might be turned off by the fact that this thing is baby blue and says \\"bikini\\" on it, but it works very well and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs to do some trimming.
B007HKO8P4|5|This color (The Abyss) is so pretty! I switched to IBD gel color polish several months ago and have found that it lasts as long or longer as the gelish polish, which I also love. I'm not a fan of the Shellac brand at all. I do use the gelish base and top coat and it works great with IBD. I think IBD is the easiest to get on in nice thing coats and at such a cheaper price it makes it totally worth it. Overall, LOVE IBD and this color did not disappoint.
B001E9P87G|4|Getting rid of those calluses really makes a difference in your foots appearance. On my way to have the pretty feet I've always wanted!
B003USJXAM|5|Lathers nicely and has a lovely scent. Far richer than a lot of other brands.<br />I would recommend it to one and all.
B006ZR8BPI|5|Great brushes!
B0012QNYLS|5|I use this on my hair and body. It's the best moisturizer I have found. As I get older my hair is getting finer and very white. This product helps control my hair while making it look younger than it is.  Just a  little in the palm of my hand to apply to my hair is all that is needed.<br />The scent is coconut which I love.
B00CFBOXT6|5|i have tried so many products that don't work.  short and sweet just buy it
B000V76ALU|5|Love this! Light and glowy!
B003NV9R2U|1|poor quality
B0071Q5PL0|5|A little embarrassing for me to write a review on such an intimate product but I'm so pleased with it that I wanted to pass it on. Works very well to prevent and treat symptoms of irritation during and after sex.  I found since pre-menopause has begun that things have changed and this product really has made all the difference in keeping intimacy going.  That it is made up of all natural ingredients and is so gentle on the skin is wonderful.
B000A0BP5E|5|i must say this product really does work ,,,,we have used for years  ,, never disapointed
B002DPUY10|5|Thick rich moisture rich cream, great for super dry skin. Though I use it head to toe for baby smooth soft skin!!
B0049LUI9O|5|Very please so far with this purchase! I have used it several times and it works great! It is easy to use and keep clean.
B00KP5TS4Y|5|work nicely
B001AJ8YGC|5|I was apprehensive at first to switch over to an electric razor seeing as I had never used one. However, I am more than satisfied with my purchase of the Phillips Norelco Razor. It works great; gives a close, smooth shave; and is very easy and convenient to use! It was also a very reasonable price and was shipped to me very quickly. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable, great product.
B009UZ9GNS|5|The shampoo is awesome--my hair just loves it. My hair is shinier, less frizzy, and evens seems to stay cleaner for an extra day or two after a blowout. The conditioner is just okay.
B00DJ5WG5A|5|This pen works really well, and it has a pretty big gap to put oils in so you dont really need the syringe, you can pour it right out of the bottle. One thing I really liked about it was that it had 3 levels of how potent you wanted to burn the oils. Overall a good product, happy I bought it.
B004NMYILI|5|Works perfectly!
B007ZR2RRA|5|I love this stuff! One coat is plenty! I've been using it over a base coat (OPI) and it spreads SO easily and smoothly. It looks great!
B007TC0HIC|3|Drying
B00OFUHAOK|5|Recommended by a friend, so purchase one set for wife. With its excellent product design, She loves it so much. It has been a nice experience with this product.
B000FJ2I2O|5|Nice razor
B000E7WHCI|5|This is a oldie but goodie. This is still the best of her collection and number one in my book.
B00KGO8XY0|5|I am very very happy with the purchase of the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.  Use it every day, no more wrestling with false eyelashes (are they straight, even etc . . ) and mascaras that really don't thicken or lengthen.  I will purchase again . . . .  FOREVER!!!.
B001ECQ5IE|5|nice
B00P8CQK90|5|Amazing produce. A great quality oil. I like the enclosed pump for dispensing. I am enjoying the downloaded e-book w recipes. Will be reordering.
B00461F4PA|5|best i have ever used!!!
B004B0U57S|5|I got mine yesterday and I love them! they fit my nails perfectly and are the right color!!! Will be ordering more! oh and it came earlier than expected!!! That was a plus!!!!
B0001BNU5A|4|Package came on time and was well protected to prevent damage to the glass container.
B000PLSP88|3|Good but not great.  Certainly not worth what they are charging!
B008U5RUW8|5|love love
B00BWB3YTA|2|The bruushes are pretty good till the 3rd time you use them and they start falling apart, i was disappointed. the work they were doing was amazing but they broke, like a little play set. when you first start using them they seem professional, not recommended.
B005Y0AZXI|1|I was disappointed with this product. I choose My Pink Wink because of the reviews, but I tried an entire bottle, which was a small amount considering the price. After using the all of the product I still didn't notice any difference. Not even a little skin lighting. I gave it  one star because it was gentle and caused no allergic reactions.
B002R2CSK4|5|It went on a little lighter in color then I had imagined. It is a great smooth, long lasting lip liner.
B00VSEINZQ|5|I just finished my first complete jar of this cream. I must say that my face feels softer, firmer and it appears to look not as &#34;saggy&#34;. I used it twice a day, everyday from the moment I bought it until it ran out. I will buy another jar.
B003D7LDF8|5|Love this product.  Beautiful scent without being over the top.  Great lather.  Would love to see soap and bubble bath by this company.  I will order this again, and again, and again.
B00HG1JFXY|5|I have pretty thick hair already but I dye my ends often various colors and they seem to look limp so I tried this serum after trying multiple drugstore products. This serum is awesome it put life back into my hair and it makes me hair super soft and full and my ends don't appear to be as damaged as they were just a few months ago!
B001E5E9XO|5|I wish I could find in stores. people stop me all the time wanting to know where I get the color. when I say on line it gives them a frown. I have been using this color for years and years ....Love it.
B00EUKE56G|3|I thought these were white with blood on them but they are clear. I put a clear coat over them to make then last longer but they started withering away after about a week.
B00NY6V96Q|1|Not slouchy enough for all my curly hair. Will be returning this
B00CXOWAV8|5|The best tooth brush and heads - soft and protects the gums
B0021MLVA8|4|I was impressed with this YSL fragrance, it had a stylish and sophisticated way about it and it projects very well. Its a fragrance to get when you are low in budget and want to wear a fragrance that will be well appreciated by the ladies in a club or the female boss @ your job.
B000R0011Q|5|My wife loves how this moisturizes and smells.
B004YZ3XX8|1|Don't waste your money
B001KYQBAI|5|I absolutely love this brush. My grand daughter has long curly hair that has always been a nightmare to get brushed out.  Until  we found this brush!! I can't believe there is no more struggle about getting a brush through her hair-wet or dry!!  I ordered this not really believing it would work but figured we'd take the chance.  I'm so glad I did!! I'll be ordering another one before school starts so she has one for her backpack.
B004GGA7BG|5|Work great.  Sturdy instruments. Excellent price.
B0075CI4D6|5|Works like a dream come true.
B003P3CZ66|5|Amazing product! I can't believe the company has discontinued it!
B00G08XZEE|5|I love it. I am going to buy it again.
B002HPBF32|4|it helped me to try the best skin79 bb that fits my skin so happy to try them, each is enough for almost 4 usages which gives you enough time to judge the best one!
B007KAESZG|5|very good I get it for my daughter that loves it just wish it comes in a bigger bottle
B002NBFBLW|5|Love this item ..... use it all the time
B0009DYBOY|5|This product is excellent.  it is not expensive as a little goes a long way.  Everyone comments on how nice my skin looks.  my doctor recommended this line years ago and it was hard to find then... I am happy that it is more easily available now.
B0080EEMCA|5|Shipping fast and good quality!
B007I2GQA6|3|didn't love it didn't hate it. made my skin sort of dry but worked well for an alternative to shampoo.
B009EDYACI|1|worst wig i had ever had!!!!!! DONT BUY THIS WIG COLORS DO NOT  LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE<br />AND I COULDNT GET MY MONEY BACK!
B00HJONTO4|5|Matched my hair color nicely!<br />Even have gotten tons of compliments on it :)
B00K4F9NT0|5|Love this product. Exactly what I was looking for in a SPF cum moisturizer! Easy to apply, applies evenly and gives good coverage.
B00CCYT3TQ|5|First here is my skin type I have sensitive skin so a lot of the other acne products either Don't work for me very well or Dries out my skin! I don't get severe breakouts but I do get some on my cheeks nose and sometimes chin. My Uncle Got me some of this stuff from a drug store. So I used it and at first it made my breakouts worse! But that was because It was drawing the breakouts out of my face!Then after a couple of days my skin was clear! And this Soap lasted me a LONG time! I ran out and could NOT find it anywhere! Until I found it here on amazon.<br /> I RECOMMEND THIS ACNE BAR IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN!
B00QT14EB0|5|No more mess!  I've been looking for this product for a couple of months now and I finally found it at Amazon.  I love it, I use it all the time, now when I do my nails I have no more mess around my fingers. Very pleased with the product!
B00P88VPKS|4|Just starting to use my new XTAVA hair dryer. I like that it is light weight. It might be balanced a bit better for the hand, but it can't be beat for good value. Thank you.
B007D5WFDK|5|This buffer did a great job of extending the life and appearance of Layla Holographics. I've watched a few videos testing the different bases, and I only wish I could get Nfu-Oh Aqua Base on Amazon - those results are amazing!
B00XHLGNBE|1|Came in a Hugh box with other items, packaging was very poorly done, nothing was secured and the dryer probably bounced all over the country in its loose box.  Did not cure the nails evenly.  Will try again before returning
B001E6Q652|4|Good product does not lather a lot but a little goes a long way. Will last forever. This product can be used sparingly and provides a soothing spread that results in a comfortable shave.
B002HWS7IQ|5|I can make perfect parts in my hair with the rat tail end of this comb and use the small teeth in the comb to detangle small sections of my hair at a time.  I use this comb a lot.  I thought I ordered the black, but I got one that was a caramel color of course the color doesn't matter.  It is light and yet strong and sturdy so I expect to have it awhile.
B001RPL902|5|This tool is much more effective than tweezing or waxing those pesky, ugly hairs that grow on my chin and upper lip.  It does hurt more so the first time because more hair is being removed at once, but, it is very time saving.  Rather than spending all that time plucking hairs one by one (and always missing a lot), this device will find and pull out all those ugly hairs once and for all! It is portable, cost effective and saves me a lot of time.  I am very happy with my purchase!
B0049LUI9O|5|Like the title says: setup was simple. It works well, no pulling or tugging feeling. Cleaning is a simple task: open outlet, place under running water.
B000BF6ZCQ|5|The best moisturizer I have ever used and I have used plenty. Heavy duty, takes care of winter dry skin overnight.
B00008NG64|4|DECENT JOB FOR THE MONEY. EASY TO USE,CHARGE,CLEAN,ETC.REASONABLY GOOD SHAVE, BETTER WHEN USING A SMALL AMONUT OF FOAM SHAVING CREAN THAN DRY, BUT IT WILL DO A DECENT JOB DRY . I LIKE IT.
B0009XH6TG|5|I bought this hairdryer because I stayed at a Marriott (Hilton?) in Providence, Rhode Island, and this was the hair dryer that the room was supplied with. I didn't think anything special of it when I first walked in, or when I brushed my teeth. I didn't realize what a competent little hair dryer this thing was until the next morning. When my hair was wet. And I need to dry my hair.<br /><br />The Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle seriously blows. I mean that. It puts out an impressive amount of heated air. The settings are appropriate - low, medium, high; they all provide about the amount of air you'd expect. The heat is nice. Nothing special there, but it dries hair.<br /><br />I don't think I've ever owned a hair dryer I've liked more. Granted, this is only my third one ever, but still, not too shabby.
B000O3R2GS|5|I have an eye medical condition brought on by allergies. An opthamology tech suggested I try these to help. I haven't needed a drop of prescription medication since using them in over two years! It clears oils and debris from eyes and lashes and was a miracle find.
B000PB2XHM|4|A little on the heavy side to hold, yet it is great for my thick hair and straightening my hair (10 minutes) in half the time my old iron took!
B00ZCWIUJ4|4|Used once. Did not break. Useful
B0040UQEAQ|5|I am in my early 60's and have had a hard time finding a foundation that looks natural but with coverage. I saw this on LivingWell and was excited to try it. I absolutely love this product. Full coverage that makes my completion look great. Will not ever change to anything else.
B00H4IMXRE|5|excellent
B000NNCA0C|5|The product is awesome..it works so well with my hair. I would recommend this product to my friends. If you have a dry scalp you should give it a try.
B003XUTLWW|5|Nice and thick, smells great,  I use it on my legs, (it keeps my tattoo nice and shiny and bright) my feet, and my elbows.<br /><br />I also use it as a facial moisturizer.  I love this.  I hope it is always in stock.
B001G7PWI6|5|this is a very soft bristle brush that works great on the skin; you don't want something too stiff as it will tear up your complection;  very happy with my purchase.
B004DKQHSM|1|I bought this product because I got ash blonde highlights and It just made my hair feel dirty and tangled Didn't see my highlights stay nice.Its just sitting in my shower with out use.Don't like it... On a search for a shampoo to take the brassyness away.
B00415IQGU|5|Excellent lotion.
B000HS8XVS|5|my favorite facial wash. it does dry the skin out but if you use a really good moisturizer there shouldn't be a problem
B000H30EQU|4|If you're looking for a color that washes out quickly this is not for you! But if you're looking for a fabulous long term commitment this is perfect! This color lasts for an extremely long time and really is a more &#34;natural&#34; gorgeous blue that fades to a beautiful teal. The color in the picture is from only 5 minutes of coloring from blonde instead of the 15-30 it recommends since I wanted the color gone after 2 weeks. Plus after washing it doesn't stain towels or bedding (which is amazing!). Also if you need to get rid of the color take heed and don't try using a color stripper as it will not work (the blue comes back even more vibrantly the second developer is put on!) - you'll need to bleach it!
B000O19DNK|5|The color is amazing!  Very happy I found it, it wasn't in the store.
B004TSFE6Y|1|Do not waste your money!!! Very very cheap product! I was angry i spent my money on this trash. I didn't even use it and it already broke...think material just not good
B008PJZXT6|5|I don't normally write reviews, but felt I had to for this product. This product is awesome! I have runner's feet and they are always dry, blistered, and calloused. This callus remover takes off all of that dead stuff. When I'm done, I use some unrefined shea butter. I liked this so much that I ordered one for my mother's birthday!<br /><br />For those that say it slows down and has no power...don't use so much pressure!
B00VKHKH8C|5|We are keeping lice away!
B0018DAUDK|5|The expected. Thank you very much.
B00QEOG3L6|3|i wasn't expecting much from these. They don't bring any brushes to blend your eyeshadows. Just a whole lot of flat ones for your eyelid. Different sizes. They don't pick up much product. wouldn't buy it again. The only thing I loved was they brought a makeup brush cleaner.
B00JGN1K0G|5|Amazingly soft brushes!!
B001I8E5TK|3|I am very conflicted about how to rate this program.  I mostly wanted to come on here to write a review as someone who has used this program for 3 of 4 births.  I have learned a lot.  My first birth (without hypnosis) was very long and very painful.  I decided I never wanted to experience that again, so I bought this home study course.  My second birth was a pitocin induction in the hospital.  Not completely pain free, but I was relatively comfortable all the way up to transition.  I took a small dose of Stadol at that point and after it wore off, I had a very quick and easy second stage.  My third birth was very easy.  I listened to my CDs and &#34;slept&#34; through most of the labor.  Transition was tolerable, and second stage was very quick.  Perhaps I was a bit cocky with the fourth birth, but I expected it to be similar to the first two hypnobabies births.  It was not - I had about 6 hours of uncomfortable contractions, about 5 hours of painful contractions, and about 2-3 hours of begging for help from God.  I did use some Nubain in combination with the hypnosis for part of that time when it was tolerable.  When it wore off and I was nearly dilated, I resorted to screaming.  Second stage was quick, but I was pretty shell shocked from the amount of pain I experienced.  My point is that every birth is different.  Every set of circumstances is different, and no one should feel that this program is promising them something it cannot promise.  I do think my hypnosis skills were useful in the third birth, but it was not the kind of experience I had expected or hoped for.  When I push aside those expectations I had for what a hypnobabies birth is, I realize it was not a dis-empowering birth.  It certainly was not a birth to feel badly about.  I think the program skills are pretty great - I'd advise you to skip reading the blog and following the facebook page though.  I feel those venues are promoting the best case scenarios.  I have even seen them list &#34;statistics&#34; about the results of their program that I am highly skeptical of.  I was never never surveyed.  I bought the program back in 2005.  I would have stated that my first two births were &#34;nearly painless&#34; but certainly not &#34;painless&#34;.  I don't discourage you from buying this program, but I do discourage you from thinking it a sure bet for a painless birth.  A lot of rave reviews are from women who have used it once or twice.  I don't know how many women have used it three or more times. (???) This was my experience, for what it's worth.
B00ICPLHCU|3|I HAD HIGHER HOPES FOR THIS PRODUCT. IT'S BEEN 4 WEEKS AND I'M SORRY TO SAY THERE ARE NO NOTICABLE SIGNS THAT THIS PRODUCT DOES WHAT IT SAYS. HOWEVER I PURCHASED 4 MONTH SUPPLY SO I WILL GIVE IT 4 MONTHS AND DECIDE AT THAT POINT WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE USING. SO MY OPINION<br /> &#34;NOT AS ADVERTISED&#34;
B003YLYNWS|5|It is a very good product if you suffer varicose veins, I bought it for my sister in law who was visiting for holly days but after she left I tried it one day that I was feeling very tired, like I had run a marathon, I applied to both legs and rest them up for about 20 minutes, the pain I was feeling during hours completely disappeared!!!.
B002MO3CG6|4|Love this stuff for my 2 year old whose hair can get a little wild. I have been using this for about a year, it smells good, has good ingredients, and leaves no residue on her hair. Her hair is super soft after use. My teenage son loved it so much he took her bottle so I came back to get another!
B0089FSLX6|3|It smelled great but made me cough so I had to give it to someone else to enjoy.
B00QU7Q1JG|5|I have to tell you just how pleased I am with this product! I bought this for my 16 year old who has two VERY different sized breasts in hopes of helping her feel less insecure and without having surgery and so far I am very pleased with the results. It may not be the complete finish she is looking for, but it is seriously making a huge difference and I noticed results in just a little over a week. Worth the money, trust me on this.
B0015HEDK0|3|I still have scars after delivering baby. But I think this moisturizer work on to moisture the dryness on my skin.
B004TSFBJO|5|One of my favorite brushes ! Very easy to blend with so I never look like I have clown cheeks
B001QMNWKQ|5|Exactly what I was looking for, can't stand none of the wipes, just make my eyes feel sticky, this is soft non-sticky and doesn't hurt my eyes although I rub it all over my eyelids to get mascara out :)
B000UVZU1S|4|Inexpensive and moisturizes.  No, miracle cure but it feel nice.
B005UOMFM2|1|I have not seen any result so far using the cream. The new product had no effect. Big pink strawberry pills, seems like it reversed the results of the former product. I bought two 60 count bottles. Greatly disappointed.
B00CWH1JP4|4|Great line of products, but a bit pricey. Difficult to locate in stores, so we order usually. This is a small bottle. If you like it, look for a better price per oz.
B00C9ELD8I|1|It's always so dried out
B0057RKOJI|5|It's hard to find this in stores for some reason.  Maybe it's always sole out for being such a great product.  Inexpensive but highly effective to eliminate and/or control break outs. Leaves my face visibly clean.  Does not over dry and helps me to control my oily skin.
B002HWS9FW|5|My favorite toothbrush of all time
B009LOA0QA|4|Very pretty color.
B007NQA77U|1|HIGHLY disappointed! I thought I would give this one more try but...the top of the bottle had been taken off and looked like someone tried to put it back on! Missing some actual product inside. Very disappointing and cannot trust this company let alone the smell...(Have had other issues with them). The company itself is poor. No quality control or customer service no matter where you buy it. The product does not do what it claims either. Sadly, I won't be buying this again.
B00023AKGY|5|This product is a great alternative to the oinments you buy in the drug stores. It took care of the problem that it was suppose to. Would purchase again.
B005UL3LVY|4|Great lipsticks for the price. They go on smooth and seem to last well. They feel nice on my lips and have no noticeable smell or taste. The colours are less red than they seem in the picture (with all 12 lipsticks beside each other) - they're more neutral or pink with a couple of almost purples.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The lipstick isn't securely attached to the applicator so most of mine were stuck to the lid.<br />- The colours don't match the sticker on the outside making it more difficult to pick out the colour you're after<br /><br />Still a good buy if you looking to expand your lipstick collection
B00CELIECO|5|These clips are amazing!!! I bought for my daughter since most clips and ponytail holder are usually too tight for her. These clips doesn't tug or pull her hair out.
B0030ZRSHK|5|Before using this product, I had never had a wax done professionally or by myself.  So, I had really no idea what to expect.  I use sugar wax on my eyebrows, but honestly that's pretty painful and I thought that if people are using this hard wax on their bikini areas, it MUST be better than sugar wax!  Well I bought the kit that comes with the warmer.  I also bought the cardboard rings that go around the can to keep the warmer clean.  The kit comes with a DVD.  I watched it, and it seemed doable.  I am not a very hairy person, and my hair is fine, too.  Anyway, after a pretty easy learning curve, I would recommend this product to anyone is tired of shaving.  I have used it on my underarms, which works phenomenally.  I use it to wax my bikini area, and I really can't believe that it doesn't hurt more than it does.  The pre-waxing oil seems to work great.  I do get some ingrown hairs, but bought an antiseptic gel to use immediately after waxing.  Then, when that's dry, I use baby powder.  Then next few times I shower, I exfoliate and use the gel/baby powder again.  The ingrown hairs are much, much better!  The real trick is to use the wax when it is not runny at all.  It should be \\"gloopy\\".  I heat it for a little while on hot, then to extra low.  Sometimes I even turn it off for a few minutes.  The wax does not need to cool that much before you pull it off again.  If you wait too long, it will obviously harden too much.  Also, you will learn that you need some \\"lead area\\" (i.e. a hairless starting point) for getting a grip on the wax.  So, apply it just outside the hair growth, and that's where you'll hang onto it to remove it.  Way less painful that way.
B0028RC5N8|5|Of your eye shadow!  Amazing how it really pulls out the pigment of the shadow.  Be careful when applying the shadow, because you can make it too dark!  It's that effective, the primer.
B006DR2BO2|3|I had been using a double-edge safety razor previous to this and redeemed an offer that got me this for free.  My face seemed to really like it, but I didn't go buying refills after this was done for.  Instead, I went back to an electric razor as I've had enough with cutting my face up all the time.
B00MXJMMYS|5|I love Alba--great product!
B003RFA4QA|4|I would have given it a 5 star but it smells and feels a little sunscreenish. It is better than some I have tried.
B00CGUJN82|5|no words...so good so good so good
B002B8VE4U|5|Great ; little dryer for Africa!
B0000535CH|4|It's been almost a month, and I've seen a little improvement, but it's definitely a start, I'll keep everyone updated to see if it's worth it after one more month.
B004YLCS4M|1|This product ruins a hairstyle. I spray it on sparingly on dry styled hair  as directed. Leaves my hair looking slick and greasy, not shiny. I have given this product several tries before finally  tossing it in the garbage.<br /><br />I don't understand the good reviews for this product.  It has never been an enhancement on my hair. Maybe it's a hair type thing. I have fine wavy hair. I use this product after styling my hair with a curling iron.
B0085BVFZK|5|Wonderful,,,,,
B004XRGWTY|5|Very good product, a little expensive but still good stuff, if price was the same as the sport one(blue with orange names) I would buy this one more often.
B0046KHG7K|5|This shampoo is great for blonds (me) and also great for grey hair (hubby). It keeps his hair a beautiful shade of gery with no yellowing in it and it keeps my color from looking brassy. An all around great shampoo..
B00OABVSYC|5|How does one describe the sensation of this stuff. It's like laying in a cloud of rose petals underneath the mist of a waterfall.<br />Smell- is like Shakespeare<br />Feel- is far more hydrating than water ever could be<br />Performance- I noticed tighter skin seconds after apllying.
B007TC0HIC|5|I am 'poo-less' so I only use conditioner, no shampoo.  Therefore, I have used quite a few great organic conditioners.  Pura d'or Argan Oil is a perfect conditioner.  No residue, very pleasant aroma, and my hair is showing healthy improvement from root to tip.
B004GXZOEO|5|My mom stocked my bathroom with one of these when I came to visit. What a perfect idea. Not only does it exfoliate the skin, but it stays lathered up and keeps my soap from turning into a gooey mess. I bought these for all my house mates as well. There's nothing more annoying than finding little soap chips on the shower. (except for hair...that's pretty annoying and creepy too). We no longer have a soap dish in the bathroom.  When my soap gets low, I just add another bar. The draw string bead keeps the soap inside the pouch while it lathers. I spray mine with white vinegar at the end of my shower because I'm a freak about bacteria. Once a month I toss it in a small mesh laundry bag with my laundry and it hasn't broken down or lost it's shape. (Most people go ahead and replace them, but I usually forget or get distracted when I'm shopping. LOL... not now though. I'm buying more as we speak!). I've also painted the bead with nail polish to distinguish between them incase someone has a duplicate color pouch. It's perfect for travel and the four pack here is a pretty good deal- comes to about $2 a piece when you include S&H.
B005LEBPW2|5|freaking funny!! I got a couple of these as gifts for people for the holidays. It was a hit, everyone LOVED them!!
B00120VWJ0|3|Purchased from Glutenfree4U - product is fake.  I've been buying Dr. Bronner's peppermint soap for years, the scent was wrong and it didn't wash off cleanly.
B006K3TZS4|4|The henna is a high quality, and very affordable. I love the tiny packaging, and it came quite quickly. 100 grams was enough to do my shoulder length hair.
B004N1EQNO|5|I started using this shampoo within the last year or so. So far I have been very happy with it. The scent is nice and it lathers much easier than other hair loss shampoos I have used before. I have been using the Lipogaine topical solution for about three years and have not noticed any progression of my hair loss in that time frame. I have actually seen a big difference in the overall thickness and feel of my hair since starting with Lipogaine. I am only a 2 on the NW hair loss chart and with the aid of Lipogaine products I hope to stay that way for a while. Very happy with my results and plan to continue using this product!
B000ORWOVW|3|I've had a lot of problems finding natural deodorants that continue to last for me for any length of time, and this is no exception. It worked great for about two weeks, then became less and less effective. I have had this problem with every other natural deodorant I have ever tried, though, so this may be a personal problem and not a product problem. Just make sure you really like the smell of sage before purchasing, because this stuff really smells like burning sage, minus the smoke.
B00AFCP2RY|4|It showed up with some built up pressure that resulted in some of the shampoo forcing itself out of the base of the pump, other than that it has been fine.
B0043U1Y6M|5|I love this lipstick! After doing tons of research on a lipstick that lasts this is the one that I came up with.<br />It doesn't dry out the lips like all long lasting lipsticks do and doesn't cake on like the long lasting lipsticks.<br />This is a regular lipstick that lasts very long. You can eat and drink with it and it won't come off.
B0000AHS9X|5|Both my wife and daughter love theirs. They both claim it's far better then others costing twice as much.
B0013TNMES|5|I bought this because my toenails are gnarly and gross because of some kind of foot fungus, and they work great! Now all my toes are trimmed and semi-clean looking, great buy
B002QI6JR2|3|I like this shadow, my only problem it does not last long
B002HIEFQS|5|You need to use the whole bag for one bath.  Makes the skin very soft and heals cuts, dry skin, and acne.  You do need to drink water after your 20 to 25 minute soak, and just relax. It helps release toxins from your body I think. It's also supposed to help the respiratory system, but I didn't notice any improvement with my asthma.
B0025YXLRS|4|This was a brand new scent for me and I've been using Deep Sea lotion for years. It's a pretty powerful scent but not necessarily in a bad way. It was just new and different and took some time getting use to. The lotion itself seemed a bit more watery than past bottles I've gotten but, again, nothing too crazy. It's still the only brand of lotion I will ever use for my face because it dries so quickly and cleanly; never any greasy feeling and you can't beat that.
B00GP2N66W|5|It is great eye cream!  Follow the instructions and you will see the results in about two weeks. Amazing customer service.<br />I'll definitely buy through this company again.
B00KY4X8VU|5|This is by far my new favorite brush. I usually need about 3 to 4 different brushes to do my eyes but this one was able to do it all. I was definitely impressed with the quality. If you are searching for a good blending brush this is definitely the one!
B002UFZE8Q|5|I'm in my late 40's and I have extremely sensitive skin. I've been looking for products to improve the condition and appearance of my complexion. This product is wonderful. My skin has no allergic reaction to it. I use it after washing and moisturizing my face at night. My skin texture and appearance have improved enough that I can see a difference. I'm very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.
B000KVH1QU|4|I've always been 1 to shower every other day and my hair remains really healthy because of it.  When I had long hair, the oilyness of my hair wasn't such an issue, because I could just pull it back the second day.  But with my short hairdo, it looks so oily by day 2.  I was resorting to washing my hair every day.  Well, I got this, and it works really well!  I just spray on and use a bristle brush to smooth through my hair.  It soaks the oil right up leaving my hair looking just washed.  My only problem is that my hair sticks up in all directions in the morning.  I haven't tried it on wet down hair, and I don't have time to blow dry in the morning.  I've taken to putting the can and brush in my purse to use at work once my hair has dried.  I use the tropical smell.  It's really light, not overwealming at all.  There is a split second when you spray it that it has a smell mch like just sprayed hair spray, but it goes away extremely fast!  I will definately buy more!
B00G9T4598|5|Very happy with the product ..
B000F4USF8|5|I think this product beats out other similar products in this price range. It's good quality and works very well
B000PY17PI|3|The brush works as advertised, however, it is not for every kind of hair. I have very straight, very fine hair. I usually dry it with a round brush and a blow dryer so I was excited to try this. The problem, if you have my kind of hair, is that the bristles are simply too far apart and the hair slides right off. It didn't add any volume and actually gave me worst results than my regular tight bristle round brush. I gave it to my mom who has a thicker hair and she likes it. I still like the idea but I'll buy a different model to better suit my hair type.
B00AO4E9DG|5|Amazing. Actually smooths the hair, if you follow the instructions and spray it liberally onto your shower-damp hair. And I have frizzy thick hair, so that's saying something.
B000BUUVTO|4|The Gillette Fusion Manual Replacement Cartridges we're much better of a deal here at amazon.com.  Of course I received sooner than expected. These will last me another 8 months.
B003JMWRCK|1|Not bitter at all.  Actually, I can't taste it at all.  Should have read more reviews.... This is a horrible product.  Don't waste your money!
B001E0R22Y|5|This is a  toner for everyone from the driest skin to very oily skin!  It is so soothing, gives your skin the refreshment it needs without, any of the harmful chemicals!
B000Q34X8Q|5|My favorite sent.
B00UARS5GO|5|Great razors at a good price.<br /><br />Hey, what's with this &#34;subscriptions for razor blades&#34; nonsense?
B00R1WOYC0|4|It's really small but works good using 2 fingers and your thumb to was your face. I wish it was A LOT bigger so I could use it on my body.
B00AVE2RT2|5|Works as stated.
B002N5MHLA|5|just what I wanted and it came when they said it would
B002EP9OUG|5|This hard wax is awesome, it is the best one I have every used so far! I love it, definately worth it. I will come back again once I finished mine.
B00AHAWWO0|5|WORKS GREAT.
B000VEJVCI|1|I have been using this conditioner for over 20 years. The most recent purchase was not used right away, as the previous bottle was not quite finished. When I finally did use it, I was very disappointed! The conditioner I received was of a very soupy consistency - which indicates to me that is either a counterfeit product or it was repackaged after being watered down.
B00JBCKQXO|5|I always suffered with short hair. It never grew, like ever. Since I started taking these vitamins my hair has grown, so has my nails! Not to mention the fact that the founder is a super sweet honest woman! Try it! There's no side effects!
B0099EHM86|5|It is now wintertime and it's cold out, and this is probably the healthiest my hair has ever looked.  A little bit goes a long way but it still is kind of expensive.  I still would recommend it.
B00FM6C74E|5|Beautiful scent!
B000P1OXES|5|works good.
B0006PS3G2|5|Perfect size nail file perfect gits for  a baby shower everyone love it the gifts. I very happy with the products.
B00DS3MHPW|4|Bough it for my wife and she like it
B001KOTRJA|5|It's hard to buy a perfume from a magazine card but so glad I did.  Not over-powering but people will make note of how nice you smell.
B000F6RFX4|5|It's amazing ILOVE
B00I32AN4K|5|Used it once and saw an IMMEDIATE difference in my hair. My hair is thick, very curly and VERY damaged from straight ironing it 2x a day for over a year. Recently I decided to stop and give my hair time to grow and repair...this is like a miracle in a jar. My hair has never felt so amazingly soft.
B00A8PJRFQ|5|Wife loves it
B008I2IKI6|5|Works Great!
B000JLEVP0|5|Excelente.
B00IDYRKHQ|3|Not exactly what I expected, but ok.
B00C7DYBX0|5|Best product I ever used. been using it for 7 months and it never disappoints.  Put it on after the<br />vitamin C serum drys and it smooths out all the wrinkles.  Apply moisturizer and off I go, try it you will be amazed.  1/3 the price of the others and it works great.
B00HNF1CLG|5|Love this !
B00GTZG7P2|5|Very good
B00M4PLBDE|5|These rollers are perfect and at a much better price than what there sold for at the Emjoi site..<br />very pleased with the price and got them super quick..
B005RGAJHQ|5|Since I have been using this product, I have had numerous comments on how &#34;good&#34; I look.  At the age of 65, I'll take it!
B0023X8D1U|4|yes, these actually work. they aren't for building muscle or anything like that. More like aerobics or cardio. good product.
B00K4EC5UA|3|Not surprisingly, there is no mention of the size I could find anywhere in the description of the item.  Only if you enlarge the pic and look at the tiniest numbers at the left corner would you get this essential piece of info. 15% Epsom salt. What is &#34;Pure&#34; in that Dead sea salt? It is a purely overpriced item with important info omitted. Otherwise, there is nothing wrong with this item. It smells nice and dissolves without trace.
B006Z9ACMG|5|This oil is awesome. I use it as massage oil and I love it. It has almost no scent at all making it a great base oil to add a scent to.
B002Z3NMCI|4|i found that i need to purchase my lotion here on amazon otherwise i get hosed.  the lotion works well and goes on easily.  it does smell good, however i didn't really like the smell after you'd laid in the tanning bed.. i'd buy it again, though
B001GCVJHE|1|Should have heeded the advice in another review of this product and saved my money! The sheets are slick, slippery, nonabsorbent and good for?????  Paper towels work better.  Buy rolls of \\"Bounty\\" instead--waaaay more effective.
B0054JESY6|5|We use these as wipes on our granddaughter.  Excellent wipes.  Just moisten them.
B00CNWY1YY|5|I love it!! I got it on time and it was as described. Is very helpful for exfoliating, but be careful when massage because if you do to hard you'll irritate your skin.
B000FK6F18|1|Started using rare minerals 3 nights ago and it gave me pimples.  I told the woman at the store where I bought it that I absolutely did not want anything that would mess up my skin.  I usually have no blemishes whatsoever but wanted to start protecting my skin as I got older.  Now 3 days in I have 5 pimples.  I'm extremely annoyed and am going to try to get my money back.
B008GRR21O|1|Sent it back the same day. I just wanted to see how good these wigs actually are and their horrible. The wig was tangled too.
B003J82VYI|5|I have used this specific brand of Hcg 3 times now & have had tremendous success...I have lost over 60 pounds & recomend it to anyone needing to lose weight.[...]
B00DM2SBLS|5|I love it.
B005UFN3VS|2|the pliers gets stuck and its hard but loved the feathers colors nd length .. loved the diff color eads
B003NXSJUE|5|Love these, perfect in every way. Nails nice and smooth.
B0016OCUTI|3|Love the color but like so many LUSH products I had an allergic reaction to some ingredient.  Probably the strong perfume.  Too bad since the color results are very natural and leaves hair soft and healthy looking.
B004XWE8HW|5|Very well.<br />Thank you.
B002S8PWI2|5|I'm 16 btw. And this is the best lip gloss pallet ever! I had Amazon Prime, so the shipping was fast, and my pallet was delivered right away. I was a little skeptical about trying it out, but I'm happy I did, cause I have actually fallen in love with these colors.<br /><br />These colors are great for everyday wear. What I love most about this product is how pigmented it is. It's smooth and creamy rather than the original hard base lip gloss pallets. And a little goes a long way. I love combining and blending the colors together to add some cute and natural zing to my lips. My two favorite combinations I like to blend together is the second and fourth color.<br /><br />I'm extremely satisfied with this pallet. This is the best I've ever had. A TOTAL MUST-HAVE! &lt;3
B004PYN3CE|5|I have tried every shampoo out there for curls, and this one is marvelous! Don't expect suds, but keep in mind that SLS (sodium laurel sulfate, the ingredient in most shampoos, was originally developed to clean grease off the floors of manufacturing plants) produces lather but is incredibly harsh. Sulfate-free is the way to go! I LOVE the way my hair looks after using this shampoo with the keratin conditioner. Miraculous!
B00KLJDYL2|5|I feel and see a difference.
B004VT1RYE|5|Smells heavenly and is environmentally friendly.  Yay!  I liked it so much I had to go out and buy one for a friend.
B008VU6ZN2|5|Recieved product fast. Great pigmented color. Mixes well with clear acrylic powder and makes a lot of bright beautiful product.
B009UE1SF8|5|love it
B0019VD09C|5|I love this soap.  It exfoliates but doesn't dry my skin.  Great product.
B003KU4BXO|5|i love the fragrance and was so happy that i could find it online to purchase.  i would definitely recommend this to a friend.
B00VSEINZQ|5|I have red, dry patches on my face and this product works great. It absorbed quickly and left my face feeling soft. It has a wonderful light scent, almost like a marshmallow treat. Its a pleasant smell and it did not irritate my skin at all.
B007L9BF3Y|5|very elegant, sophisticated and retro.  I makes you think of silent film stars and vintage elegance, no old lady scent here, a scent for a strong yet elegantly feminine woman of another era.<br /><br />Fantastic.
B007B8VD6E|5|Timeless Black is a matte black eye shadow base.  Can be worn alone, or even as an eyeliner!  You can also \\"set\\" it with powder eyeshadow(s).  Highly recommend.
B001204REM|5|I have looked for a non-greasy massage gel for years. It had to be slippery, yet not oily,<br />and washable.<br /><br />This is it. The best
B00C1TR0AG|5|This is my 2nd order, I had to place anther one! I couldn't pass up the quality, quantity in pieces and most especially the prices!!! I go to beauty store n drop $100+ easily on extensions. I'm still using the extensions from my first purchase n they're still holding strong. I was just afraid I wouldn't find a deal like this again so i took advantage, now thinking about it, I might just order anther set. Both order I got the 22 inch platinum blonde and with the first order I dyed to match and blend into my hair better, I straighten, curl them, these extensions are great quality you won't be disappointed n shouldn't pass up!!! They were delivered very fast!!!
B000N0OSAU|5|Being in my 60s, I thought I would give this a try. Well guess what? This product really works!!! People have commented on how refreshed and young I look.  Could it be, I don't look like I have makeup on, just a refresh youthful look? Now you cannot see my dark circles around my eyes or red spots on my face. I have very sensitive skin, and my skin is softer with no breakouts. I am sold on this product. However it does take time and patience using the airbrush. I must admit on a couple attempts I had to wash my face and start over. It takes me 5 minutes to put my makeup on, but with practice it should take less time. But hey 5 minutes to look younger and get compliments is sure worth the effort.
B002GJU2YW|5|this ia a great product!  I have use for years now,  last me a year before I need to replace them
B002OOYMTK|5|This facewash make your face look clean for long term. Besides, using it for long time makes your skin glow.
B000UIELRK|1|I received this really fast. I wasted $19.99 because this is not Halston. This is a very bad smelling something. I knew it wouldn't be perfume because of the price.
B00IQX1K3Y|5|Beautiful as a under eye powder to set makeup and work as a highlighter! Super super soft!
B005R3H2HY|4|Pros: It's really pretty, layers well and is really eye catching. Great for special occasions. You can really change the look of it using different bases and changing the number of layers you put on.  Cons: It's reallly hard to remove, Need pure acetone to do it well. It chips very easy.
B005HIH8LE|5|I really like this stuff, I am a guy but it really makes my hair soft and as long as my girlfriend likes the feel of my hair I will continue to use it. My local Wal-Mart is either no it any longer carrying this product or are always out,,,none the less, I get a better deal on Amazon for it anyway
B002RNVV2O|5|Great Transaction, product of great quality, delivery was quick and experience was wonderful!
B000XE247K|5|My mother used to wear this fragrance all the time.  I wear it a lot because it reminds me of her.  Good memories.
B0046W14OO|5|My skin type is normal (not too dry, not oily).  I am sensitive to perfumes, chemical, preservatives, etc.  I love that this is 100% pure.  The scent is light and pleasant.  A very small amount covers my face and neck.  I goes on smooth and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized.  It contains hyaluronic acid, which improves my skin quality.
B001CT02B0|5|My favorite!
B001B4NBOQ|1|I bought this to wear instead of the patchouli oil I usually wear to change it up a little. The oil barely smells like anything- I put a ton on, and I smelled like sandalwood from very close for only about five minutes before the practically nonexistant smell wore off completely. Then after it sat on my shelf for a few months, which is really not that long for a bottle this size at all, the oil stopped smelling like anything but old stale vegetable oil. I had to throw it away. It was a complete waste of money!
B001MA0QY2|5|My daughter is a professional hair stylist and this was given to her as a gift. She said it is the best flat irons she has used and people often ask where did she get them. According to her these are some of the best curlers out there and her clients absolutely loves them.
B001W039GY|5|Calms you and takes Cate of the problem  pretty well. This product is really helping. I was taking ditz baths forever. It tells you to use a scoop, but it doesn't have one. You only need about 2 tablespoons. I put some in the cover and put under the warm water. It has a nice healing feel
B001BR4O80|4|I don't find this product to be anti-feathering for the over forty crowd at all.  However I do like it as a lipstick sealer.  I use a brow wax stick to line the lips to prevent feathering.  That works.  Mac has the best brow wax stick but it is pricy.  Have been experimenting with cheaper brow wax sticks, so far nothing touches Mac.
B002CMLHEC|5|my daughter thinks it is the best treatment she has ever used on her hair it does not make her hair sticky feeling
B00507HUBK|5|I took these to my local nail tech where I get my nails done because I have never used these  before and when she showed me how to use them it came out really neat.She loved playing with them too.
B00J4FA4SA|5|Item arrived as described and it was shipped quickly!  I am a happy customer!
B003VND38E|3|It has a bit of a shine to it.  I have used bareMinerals all over face color in the past but it didn't have any shine at all.
B003PXZI2O|2|Wen is a great product, but it is not for everyone.<br />I liked that Wen had a pleasant aroma and had a very creamy texture which felt great when FIRST applied to my soaking wet hair. My fingers could glide through my wet hair with ease, but as I looked down, my hair was coming out in chunks. Two handfuls of hair and a 40 minute shower later I dried my hair only to find it looked and felt exactly the same as before using Wen. The only difference was the day proceeding my first use of Wen, I had never seen my hair so matted and tangled.<br /><br />I guess I just wish I was one of the people Wen actually worked on!
B000F37UNM|5|I'm a guy.  I have big guy figures and nails. Still have to cut them.  These things are actually the best I have ever seen.  I saw one rating that gave them one star, the reason was basically if you do not have feeling on the didget of the nail that you are cutting do not use.  Someone likley cut themself.  That is likely true. I haven't tried, but I am pretty sure these things could be used as tin snips.  These are almost like a power tool of nail clippers.
B003NR7WYO|5|Love this perfume, the only sent I can wear
B005IDTVC2|5|Make complexion glow
B004BL95HI|5|I have only used it about four times and my face feels softer and cleaner. Glad that I finally purchased one.
B00EOAZZXO|5|I really liked this as an alternative to aluminum containing antiperspirants.  I found one (Le Couvent Des Minimes) that I preferred.  It works decently.
B001GIHKP8|2|Does not really color great but no skin reactions. price is ok. goes on nice. no play for mr gray!
B00CJ29P7Q|5|Only been using it for about 21/2 weeks know will let you know in about a month or two to see any regrowth in my hair?
B000UK2W4C|5|This is it, priced just right.
B001I9XILK|5|It might sting a bit when you first put the drops in, but itchy eyes are soothed instantly thereafter. Even my husband commented on this the first time he used it. I have pet and seasonal allergies and can't imagine being without this!
B000PXYAL2|2|Doesn't have enough &#34;umph&#34; and the brush doesn't lock in so its always flying off or coming out tangled up in my hair.
B006FLBMB4|5|I can't say enough good things about this lotion!! Not only does it moisturizer better then any lotion I've ever used, it smells great, and hides little imperfections while giving your skin a natural radiance. I absolutely recommend this lotion to anyone, wether you tan in a salon or not! :)
B003USHXRC|3|Moisturizes but not firming
B00ISDOYV2|5|I love it not only dose it reduce the appearance of cellulite, it also makes my skin smooth and soft. I mix it with lavender or jazmen to hid the sea like scent.
B00AHIV9NC|5|Love all of Sisley products.
B00OJRIN9U|5|Love LOVE these.  I have been experimenting with colored clip-on extensions. These are amazing and the color is gorgeous. Especially love the purple.  I wear my hair &#34;wavy / messy&#34; a lot, and these curl VERY well with a fat iron.  They stay in all day.  Like your own hair, you need to care for them properly if you want them to last a long time.  I will be purchasing more!  This photo shows the purple and a little of the blue.
B00D8JY58S|5|Eye product is good.
B000NFEX5K|5|Great product left my hair looking smooth and silky.  A little pricy.  Nonetheless, it worked great.  Will definately buy again.
B00DAHWOOA|4|I use it before drying my thick course highlighted hair.  Sometimes use on dry hair, but just a little for some control.
B000E7UFS6|5|This is a great cologne my wife loves the scent very manly but soft smell itvwont give you headaches. Highly recommended moneys worth 100%.
B004K4LAHO|5|I love this product, I use it on my hair, skin and nails! It works great and smells yummy!
B001878E9I|5|I'm 42 years old with better skin than I had 20 years ago due to this product. Not harsh and deep cleans . Keeps my skin tight and soft. Use on neck as well. I've had no blemishes or by<br />Breakouts since using this product the past 2 years. Take a look at the moisturizing cream as.
B0061KQEVW|4|I receive this palette today and i must say, i loved it on the first application..  It gives great coverage and is very creamy for smoother application :) good job Shany
B00CVFZ3VS|5|I bought this product because I have heard so much on the benefits of Hyaluronic Acid Serum for aging!  I have been using this as part of my routine skin care regimen and can really tell a difference!  Both with the way my face feels and looks!  Will continue to use for continued results and it also helps in keeping it not so dry with the weather!
B000F35R00|5|Wow, it is sad that I waited so long before buying this. The difference between the cheap concenience store nail clippers and this professional grade clipper is astounding. My philosophy in life is buy it nice or buy it twice. This is one of those &#34;buy it for life&#34; purchases that makes you happy to do something as simple as clipping your nails. I'm a guy and I'm a little excited about this, but seriously when you go on interviews or talking to superiors or working with your hands, you would be surprised how important it is to have well kept nails. I've talked to a lot of hiring supervisors who tell me they usually notice if someone has dirty or unkempt fingernails - invest in yourself with this clipper.
B004JUCYHY|1|This product made my hair to hard to comb through. I did not like it.
B000MN63CO|4|Replacement heads are well made and last for a year or so. Easy to clean and maintain.  However they are hard to find locally.
B00GMEDOL0|4|If you're looking at this you probably looked at the Nuface priced at a few hundred dollars.  I had the Nuface at home from QVC for a 90 day trial.  I liked it and thought I seen a slight difference, but not enough to spend $300.!  I seen this on Amazon for $20.  It's very small compared to the size of the Nuface.  The instructions say to put it at #4.  It's very hard to see the #'s.  At #4 I can feel a little stinging, even using my face cream for conduction.  I took it down to #3 and don't feel anything, which you're not supposed to.<br /><br />I see no difference in the marionette lines that I'm targeting, in fact, they're worse, but they looked worse after the trial of the NuFace.  For a $20. bill it's worth a try!
B000Q8124O|4|I like this product, at first there was a burning sensation around my eyes, then after about a week's use it dissipated. It does make my skin feel toned. I have not been using it long enough to see the wrinkle reduction yet.
B00CHY4QFM|3|Hmmm, Like the colors but within a day color is chipping off.
B00TQ1484S|5|I make my own soaps and lotions and this Shea Butter has been a great addition to my products. The amount I received was more than expected and it has given my soaps and lotions an extra level of luxury. Arrived quickly and packaged well.
B000TGEJT8|4|Makes your hair soft and shiny. Also a lot of  definition to my waves. Will recommend this product in the future.
B00BMXYKU0|4|It's really good looking and I like all color. but mascara was bed. it was all harden when I get it. So I can't use mascara at all.
B00VYFT21I|5|Exactly what the recipient wanted.
B00OP27H4Q|4|My husband really likes this shampoo/conditioner. It smells very pleasant(yet manly). It's not overly strong.  It cleans and rinses out well. The smell doesn't have lasting power, though. That could be a positive or a negative, depending on what you're looking for. After a few hours, there wasn't really any lingering smell in my husband's hair.<br /><br />Overall, though, if you don't want the scent lingering in your hair, this is a nice shampoo/conditioner option.
B001CBDT9A|1|Although this is a great product this order is not a 'Pack of 2'. You can find this item else where for cheaper if expecting a single Pencil.
B000G33KEO|5|Mom uses it and says its great to help keep long fingernails from splitting, chipping, breaking, etc.
B009KSQAU2|1|It's not worth ordering i when I opened the box all that was left was small pieces , I wasn't worth sending back because shipping  was more than what the product cost . My lost  :(
B00KY9ODMS|1|Lets just say this is the first mascara Ive ever thrown out! i got if in a monthly subscription bag and it was clumpy rancid and horrible.,
B000GCMXWK|5|The HC was very effective on my skin.  I really liked it.
B002TRJN1E|5|Best moisturizer and detangler.works wonders in thick  curly hair preventing  frizz. Adds shine and a little will go a long way.
B000Q9ACC6|5|This is my second time purchasing this product. This is by far the BEST trimmer I have ever used. When used without any additional levels, it is very close to a regular shave.<br />5 stars+
B00776CLLG|4|Expensive, but it's organic and so they charge us the mandatory premium.  Spray pump works well, no chemical smell when I apply it.  It sprays on like a more liquidy version of regular white suntan lotion. They've priced it so that many people won't give it a try.
B00MGLARHW|5|They took a long time to arrive but they look really cute on and are super cheap. No complaints!
B00016WRAY|5|This is some good stuff and smells a little good. It doesn't really make your under arm stink.
B000VIVDG6|3|Every time I go to have my hair cut, the hairdresser is glorifying my hair \\"it is so great\\" \\"so full bodied\\" \\"so easy to work with\\" - I have NO IDEA what are they talking about. When it comes to hair styling I am all thumbs. I could not style my hair if my life depended on it. I have naturally wavy hair, but it is rather smooth and soft. My biggest problem is the frizzies. The moment my hair gets wet or if I'm in a humid environment, it gets so frizzy that I nicknamed myself \\"Frizzy-bear\\". I have tried EVERYTHING and nothing seems to tame my frizz. I cannot blow-dry my hair - is it always looks frizzier than ever and the only thing I can somehow manage is to straighten it with a straightening iron, but it damages my hair, takes away my natural shine and takes away precious time, so I don't want to do that on a daily basis.<br /><br />I had big hopes for the REDKEN Smooth Down duo. I read great reviews about them and thought that I would finally find something that will take away the frizzies once and for all. The product smells heavenly good. It's fresh and citrusy and energizing. I can feel that the conditioner does a great job, as my hair feels much softer after I rinse it, as opposed to other conditioners that somehow when I rinse them off, off goes my hair's softness with them. After drying my hair is soft, silky and smells wonderfully. It cleans my scalp, doesn't irritate and does not leave an awful residue (unlike WEN). However - my stubborn hair remains frizzy. (Though I must admit - a wee bit better, but a wee bit isn't enough when dealing with such frizziness)
B0000C4KJX|5|Have used this for over a year. Doesn't shred often and does a good job. Local stores stopped carrying it and I was glad to find it here.
B006R81LQG|3|I love this product. its a rich nice smelling cream that does not leave your hair greasy but the cream goes very fast. The container is larger than the inner vessel holding the contents. Retailers have jacked up the price because its discontinued.
B00CXSY91I|5|These are great for little girls who constantly lose their hair ties.  They are very cute, adjustable, and can be worn on the wrist without cutting off circulation.
B004WPGXMI|4|i like it
B00L2SWF7K|3|After two weeks of application, I don't see much difference
B00MDHKT9K|5|My baby cousin loved them
B001Q9QMK6|1|Great shampoo, but much too expensive,
B00GS7OKHS|4|Very happy with product.  Use it at night and my skin looks better already
B00BH97SK8|2|It actually came as Strawberry blossom instead of the cherry. The label on the container was incorrect. The Mary Kay label was correct. I did not return it because I have used this color before and it has be okay--just not my favorite.
B00UBOTZOW|1|This is worse!!!
B001JL0BWG|5|This light works better than I expected. it's very bright and almost completely silent. and it's easy to control the heat . It's very well made I love it
B00LHSNM40|1|NOT GLITTER - Small little balls - if you want glitter dust do not buy
B00AQTYZ24|5|Its really nice and durable i would make business with them again
B00HP48ERA|4|Works perfectly, It really help to blur my fines lines around my eyes.
B00H2QJ1Z0|5|I absolutely love these brushes.  They come in a  box nicely packaged and an instruction pamphlet describing what each brush is used for. Great for someone who is learning how to apply make up with brushes, or for someone who is skilled and wants a great make up brush kit
B001BODO2A|5|This comb does get very hot but I agree with many others...the off/on button does get in the way.  I purchased this thru amazon at a great price.  I did check targets in my area but they didn't have straightening combs at all.
B00J5N0Y4U|5|I feel this is a real adjunct to skin care regimen.  I  Will in all fairness use the whole bottle before rendering a full evaluation, but it is well absorbed and with the quality of its ingredients the trans dermal reception is no doubt of benefit.<br />MLG
B00I1HAPI6|5|I have used this for several days and it seems to do a good job of covering up my wonderful odor when I sweat.  Smells good and it does help me perspire less under my arms.  Overall good product at covering up my stink!
B00DAZIJ8M|5|Great product. No stick, last long and looks great. Use it for all our competition s and pageant events.
B0032FSDOA|4|Two things I suggest people that use this product:<br /><br />- Don't wash your your head every day. Try instead every other day.<br />- Use generously on your scalp when you use it.<br /><br />After 5 weeks the dandruff has stopped and I think it's helping to stop my head from going completely bald. After 3 months I will give 5 stars if I stay the same or keep improving.
B000FS05VG|5|So far this is the best hairdryer I have ever bought. I have thick hair that holds a lot of water and it cut my drying time in half. I also don't have to use a straightening iron anymore which is a plus. It's lightweight and not noisy like other dryers. I would definitely recommend this dryer to others.
B003MNL4R0|5|great price for this concealer and will order again.  Thank yu
B00AVUDDRQ|2|when I think of bb cream I think of sheer to medium consistency. this is too heavy for me. I feel like I was wearing a mask. I have good skin and like it to show through not a face full of makeup. I was kind giving it two stars.
B008MYNEBI|3|It's ok but if you use botox go with that for a lasting look
B00MJC0MMS|5|Great smelling cologne, I got a lot of compliments.
B002T4MNVY|5|Its Dr Bronners, what can you say. Great soap and an even better value by the gallon. Buy It Now
B003A86J18|5|Recommended by my dermatologist a few years ago.  I have used this product since that time, and my husband uses it also as it has a pleasant<br />fragrance, but not a feminine one.  It works beautifully, isn't real sticky, and absorbs quickly.  I keep a bottle by every sink in my house, and one<br />bottle by my comfy family room chair.  I like this 20 oz. size as I do not have to replace often.  Great size, and much better price than at my local<br />supermarket.
B003LDOSXI|5|This night cream works really well at moisturizing the skin and fine lines without being greasy.  You only need to use a small amount for it to cover well.  It absorbs right it and makes the skin really soft and smooth.  It has a lovely rose scent as well.  Well worth the price!
B009GGTKVO|5|LOVE THIS!!  Hard to find n stores.  Perfect color and not sticky or gooey.
B00BOJNTUO|2|seller was fine but perfume did not last on me at all
B008XPHAI4|1|Hmm.  First trial was today.  And the result?<br /><br />A small metal pin that holds the head together vibrated out.  Not something you want in your mouth....<br /><br />Also, the bristles feel too hard and the floss action bristles are too long and too hard.<br /><br />Shape is wrong too.<br /><br />Not impressed.<br /><br />Will try for a few more times, then back to original heads for me.<br /><br />**** UPDATED *****<br />Reduced from two star to one star.  All of the flossing action elements fall out within a week.<br />These are just terrible.  Don't waste your time.
B0050ZAYC4|5|This is a great little gift for that granola momma. It smells delicious. I used this on my son and then used the salve on my eczema. works fantastic.
B007U90J5U|5|Best top coat ever. Cannot beat the price.
B00365CEW8|5|I really like this product. I saw an ad for it in a magazine stating it could help with firming the jawline in addition to forehead wrinkles. While it, of course, hasn't gotten rid of the excess skin, it makes it look smoother and flatter, which thrills me. Also it works very well on the crows feet around my eyes. I'll definitely be buying this again.
B001GIOV5K|5|Works well as far as I can tell.  Can think of no reason not to buy it.
B000C2133O|5|Love all of Estee Lauders scents so I had to have this one.  If you love really strong florals then this is the scent for you.  It smells just like a flower garden after a spring rain.  Heavenly if you ask me, but then again I like floral scents.  So glad I can find this on Amazon at such a great price!
B003983HZK|5|The razor it self looks very impressive. Once i tried the razor, i stuck with it. It will leave your cheeks and neck pretty smooth.
B003BK96RY|5|Ok
B000VOJMUY|4|Classic!!
B001E96O4C|5|Great product.  Not too greasy or too oily.  This helps with razor burns after shaving and I even use it as a moisturizer on the days I don't shave.  A little bit goes a very long way.
B0030ZRS7A|4|Never had one of these before.  It does the job ok, but I hate to get it out as it is so messy to clean up.  Is very convenient to have at home which is why I bought.
B000NISGOG|5|Only brush I will use for grooming dogs. Retains its shape and lasts long.  Light weight. Pins are stiffer than most but that is what I need for long coats.
B00CDZIM0K|5|About two hours after using this product for the first time, I received a compliment about how great my skin looked. I’ve received several more since I began using the product. For me, the results are worth enduring the funny odor.
B002N3UUX4|5|excellent product. Recommended!
B003FZ9FXA|2|I didnot know it would have the little beads in it. If I used it which i doubt I would have to buy a bottle to spray it with. I didnot know it wasn't a spray perfume.
B000V193RE|5|I have been looking all over for a product for my fairly curly, thick hair.  A dollop or two of this helps the curls, cuts the frizz, and keeps all in place.  The only hitch is in the directions: &#34;apply the right amount of product&#34;...no idea what that is, so used abt. a quarter-sized amount...maybe then a bit more, and all was well!
B00AZQXIE4|5|does have a bit of a bite to it, dilute it for first time use. happy with purchase, brush and cream make this a complete set love the convenience
B0006TQZJK|5|The lovely scent is delicate and the soap does not melt away in a puddle of goop.  I love it
B002LFV8AS|5|muy bueno todo ,envio rapido  buen precio buena cualidad recibido mas o menos en el tiempo previsto<br />los recomendo good purchase ....ok
B004TXJ9W4|5|I can not say how happy I am with this machine. I was so nervous about buying it. I was worried that I was spending too much, that it wouldnt work, that I wouldnt know how to use it and I would be disappointed like so many facial products. I have suffered from acne and horrible skin since the age of 11. I have been on accutane 2 times in my life and i have a constant batch of retin a on hand. I have had at least 13 obaji blue facial peals at a dermatologist office and have had both microderm and kinetic microdermabrasion done too many times to count. I have spent a ot of money and still had terrible skin. I am not joking. I didnt realize how much it really effected my confidence untilI i started this on my on. The first few times I used it my skin looked kind of ...well ...abraided!  I think I used it a little too deep and it took a few days to heal up...(no scarring at all) but I have it for about a month and a half and i used it about every 3 days and I am just AMAZED at what my skin looks like. The lines on my forehead are gone... the sun damage freckly spots around my lips are almost all gone the acne around my jaw bone is 75- 80 percent resolved. I have now gotten the swing of the machine and I only used the suction at about 50 percent or less... You have to be careful because this machine can get some strong suction and you dont want to break capillaries etc... I have used it on my neck, decollette, arms and legs. I could not afford to have all his done at a salon nor would I ever have the time to set all the appointments. I still have a ways to go as far as the hyperpigmentation and 'stuff I can see thats deep under the skin. You do have depth limitations with any microdermabrasion. However I look forward to having a few more months with this. I do use this in conjuction with light therapy, retin a and vitamins. but i do believe that my issue is my cell turnover rate is very slow and my pores get clogged so that is why I am able to get away with doing it moreoften and why getting this done at a salon is not enough. I have not had any issues with the machine. I do turn it on and let it run for a few minutes prior to using, i feel like the suction is better when I do that-not quite sure why- however I watched someones video on this machine and she says she uses with the suctioned turned all the way up- I would think there was something wrong with that machine because I could not do that with mine. Like I said about half way is good for me and I do not have sensitive skin at all. As far as cost I have used this so much it only cost me pennies to have microderm now...it is by far the best investment I have made for my face. I dont have to buy facials anymore so I can spend that money on something else! So happy with this! Thank you so much!
B005F1ATJQ|3|I liked the idea of these, but you have to put the whole bag in the bath at once according to the instructions
B000JLEZW4|5|This cologne is exquisite and expensive. Caution: Amazon will not accept returns on cologne! I ordered the 6.7 oz size and determined that it was too large, but Amazon won't accept returns on that item. I wish this has been fully disclosed more clearly by Amazon. This 1.6 oz size is perfect. Thanks Amazon, not.
B000XG769O|1|Turned my skin green!!
B001OZDG2Y|5|Made so solid hand lotion with Shea Butter as one ingredient was wonderful.  Look forward to making it again. Feels wonderful!
B000XE6JQM|5|This product glides on your skin and works so well there is no need for a primer before putting your makeup on.  I love it!
B000R8715M|5|This is my first flat iron, so I'm not a veteran of this type of tool but I think it's great. It heats up quickly, and does an awesome job of straightening my long fine hair. Totally a game changer if you have stubborn hair texture like I do. It gives my hair a shiny smooth look and my hair licks don't stand a chance. I can finally experiment with lots of different looks. I love it and have been getting so many compliments on my hair these days. It's been about a month now and it has worked wonderfully.
B00355J9K4|5|I have used several body wash products - many of which were organic lines. This is by far my favorite - in another review for a variation on this product a woman wrote it made her tub slippery - I have not seen any evidense of that. My skin is definitely softer to the touch, no problems with dryness (I haven't even needed lotion), and more elastic. I see and feel a definite improvement and fewer skin issues which were mostly caused by dry skin irritation. I am 60 and find many of the Olay Regenerist and Total Effects (inc. the Definity line) to be far better than either the organic lines I have used or the pricey dept store lines - such as Lancome.
B00752ZDD0|1|Now I wanted wider curls, so I wanted to buy a larger diameter, but these just don't bend and the little bend they have rebounds in a few seconds, so they are really not usable.
B005SCFYKG|5|Great, received on time,
B002HWS9FW|4|Great deal for an inexpensive little tooth brush...
B001UFMU70|4|Does what it needs to do. THe only grip I have is that I got a blue one when I ordered this black one.
B008539DI4|5|I have been browsing through multiple listings for train cases for a couple weeks now. After evaluating many, many listings (caboodles, shany, etc.), I decided that THIS listing was the best as far as price/quality/size goes. I'm pretty sure that most train cases come from the same manufacturer in China because if you look at the \\"high-end\\" one at Sephora, the inside in identical. Same with the Shany silver aluminum one, it looks a little different as far as material/texture but i'm certain it is the same design/style. Also, I read all the reviews for the Shany one and it seemed as though SOME come with foam inserts and SOME don't. There were so many mixed reviews about the quality and I didn't want to take a gamble. I opted for this one because BLACK > SILVER. And with this one, at least I know what inside I'll be getting because it looked eerily similar to Sephora's faux snake skin train case. The only thing was this listing's lack of reviews..<br /><br />On to the case!<br />The cantilever trays ARE a little wobbily.. but after i filled all the trays they are more stable. the quality is better than any caboodle i've opened up at target/walmart. the size is perfect.. i have a ton of makeup and the adjustable trays make it easy for me to consolidate and organize. some might want to opt for the all silver case from shany though, i noticed that the black paint? comes off pretty easily if scratched. i kinda scratched the latch part when i was clumsily putting the key in.<br /><br />other than that, all in all, this is a wonderful starter train case for me. it is light, it fits all my makeup, its sturdy, the latches work, the trays are level, and its sexy in black.<br /><br />*sidenote* the description says it has wheels, which it does not. no biggie but if someone was looking at that, now you know :)
B000P9B3NY|4|I love hot showers, and as a result I get dry skin on my butt, back of my thighs, and back of my arms.  I originally bought it for firming, which is to soon to tell, but if definitely cured the dry skins bumps.  I cannot feel any immediate firming action, only time will tell.
B000HB008E|5|This product is fantastic. Can't say enough about it.  Went to the store I have  always bought it at  and  found they aren't going to carry it  anymore or any Revlon product for that matter.  Hope that I can still buy it here when I need it.  It's the best face primer out there.!
B00GE5GLQC|5|this is super cute and looks to be of good quality for how cheaply it cost to purchase.<br />I can't wait to wear it more this summer and see how long it stands up to the test of time and use
B00H1M8R3C|5|defiantly worth the money
B004LXHN3O|5|Love the color
B0009RL86E|5|[[ASIN:B0009RL86E Braun CCR3 Syncro Shaver System Clean & Renew Refills (3 Refills)]]    I bought my husband the Braun Shaver System about a year ago.  He shaves every night so by that I would say he likes it.  His face is always smooth when he comes to bed and never gives me a brush from whiskers.  He had tried electric shavers before, but always had problems with his sensitive skin.    We get the refills from amazon as that is the best price we have found.
B0069SQVK0|5|I love this stuff!! My massage therapist uses another brand, but I had been using a few of the other Plant Therapy essential oils (lavender, eucalyptus, and peppermint) and was 100% satisfied with them, so I decided to try this. I have a diffuser at home and in the office and the folks at work love it too! Great product. So far, I haven't been sick and I work at a YMCA and am around a lot of people. So I hope this will get me thru flu season!
B00ASORJDY|5|it was just exactly what its supposed to be and pure grade too ! I love how the oil pulling method is used with this
B000NKI0PO|5|I saw this on sale and thought I would try it.  My husband is hooked!  It's his new favorite soap.  One bar lasts forever and lathers up really well.  I absolutely love the smell!!  My husband never wears cologne but this makes him smell amazing.  The cologne scent lasts all day!  Definitely the best soap I've found for him.
B0000CCW1N|5|Works well!
B0051WTL6Q|3|So far, so good.  I've used some of the items from this line in the past and have been somewhat pleased.  While I don't see any big disappearance of cellulite, it doesn seem to stave off any new orange peel.  It is pricey, tho.  I think it's better for some young 19 year old chickie with a bit of a ripple - not for someone older with more.
B001Q93XV2|2|My hair isn't long enough to use it. The plastic sticks out. I think it's intended for people with hair that goes to your mid-back.
B000068PBT|5|Good product, makes the razor new
B00QYOTA8O|5|Perfect
B0049QELEC|3|Smaller than what it looks (however the measures are available and I did not check it completely).
B0049LUI9O|5|Shapes sidelocks well and is easy to clean.
B00FQCQ5AG|5|Just what I wanted and ontime shipping!
B003F26DCO|3|eeeeh .
B000TW2JQC|5|After all the good reviews I read on this, I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />First, it comes in a really cute bottle, and it's not too big or clunky, and I like how it's transparent.<br /><br />It leaves my hair looking really nourished and healthy, and makes it softer than normal.  I also experience a lot less frizzy hair throughout the day.  It also brings out the blonde in my hair and makes my hair look bright and sleek.<br /><br />This stuff just feels so great in your hair, and I use it every day!  It's a definite hair serum must-buy.
B00IT1HKV4|5|Love it ! Keeps my skin clea and hydrated perfect for acne prone skin
B000G0GW6K|2|Not the best shaver in the world.  This thing could not get a hold of anything. I would not recommend it.  Maybe is just got one that was defective.
B004BZQ9BY|4|It made some of my hair look purplish. My hair looked really pretty in the sun, though; so thats a plus. But overall, this product was great!
B000S827NM|4|I really like being able to carry this around in my bag. Especially since I go to a Catholic university and it's a little awkward when your professor (who happens to be a Jesuit) sees condoms fall out of your bag. My only problem is that you couldn't choose your case color and it took a bit of time to ship. The case I got was clear, which didn't really help with the discretion situation, but at least now they aren't flying everywhere. I love being able to carry the condoms so my boyfriend doesn't have to worry about driving 30 minutes to see me AND bringing protection.
B008KNK7UW|4|I have Rosacea and I saw this recommended to help soothe the condition.  It certainly did that and also helped soften up the dried patches of skin that came from using the prescription MetroGel that the dermatologist recommended.<br /><br />It does have a unique smell - very like tea tree oil and much stronger.<br /><br />This clay mask has what appears to be bits of leaf in it which can help exfoliate but are not at all too abrasive.<br /><br />I liked all the anti-bacterial and other natural properties without all the unpronounceable chemicals that come with the usual drug store facial products.
B007U90JC8|4|I really have to say, I am surprised at how well this top coat works! I have two small children so I am constantly washing dishes and giving baths, but this top coat held up. My pilosh lasted 5 days with this over it, and it usually only lasts a few hours to one day. I also think this is a great deal for your money, getting 6 bottles is worth it if you plan on giving yourself manicures and pedicures frequently (like I do). I will buy this product again!
B00167BFBE|4|Color doesn't seem to match my computer screen.  Applies easily.  Smooth finish.  Not a matte finish.
B000VUKQ8K|5|Hard plastic curlers for a long hair curl  Great to curl wet hair for that big curl.  Ideal to sleep in, and use instead of hot  iron.
B0058SY1X6|5|Great clippers and the best part....cordless!<br /><br />I have to admit, I was skeptical at first, but these clippers are great. Smooth as butter and just as powerful as my corded clippers.
B003760ZKY|5|I've been using this stuff for years and I'll probably be using my whole life.  It's great! I have long hair and still only need a dime sized amount so a big bottle like this will last me about two years.  It makes my hair silky and shiny without weighing it down and it washes right out so there's no weird product build up on your scalp.  I would recommend this stuff to anyone:)
B00GDIMINU|5|& she loved it! very hard to find something my mom likes so when I do I snag it! Thanks!
B00BJFY52Y|5|Good product -
B003UKM9CO|4|Nice but they get you on the replacement heads
B000TBZJOM|1|I purchased this comb in addition to the Cricket Ultra Clean Section (small) comb, which was not only much better designed, but very inexpensive. This tortoise comb is pretty, snag-free, and (apparently) handmade (hence the price?), but its slick finish is hard to hold on to, which kind of defeats the purpose of using it in the shower to comb in conditioner. The teeth work just fine, no snagging, pulling, or other complaints, but this comb is not at comfortable to grasp.
B00DY04B94|5|Like nothing else!  Penhaligon's is not the run of the mill scent. Buy it and be different.
B000FED5DU|5|Wow is such a simple word but it's a powerful word. For the price I would say this groomer is powerful. It meets and fullfills my every needs. As far as grooming that is.<br />Anyhow it trims closer than my Wahl hair clippers that I used to groom my beard. The Wahl clips faster but this cuts closer. I didn't get any snagging. Has lots of attachments and a little carrying bag.<br />I would say that if you have a thick heavy beard this might not be for you. Maybe spend a little extra but when it comes to clipping nose hairs I'm sure it could handle all contenders.<br />It's rechargeable to real impact so taking it the road would be ideal.
B00CP7M2VG|4|I purchased two of these, one in green for myself, and one in purple for my sister.  We both like them quite a lot.  The body brush feels quite good on shoulders.  The face scrubbers are very nice.  I use the stiffer face scrubber on allergen-heavy days to remove whatever was in the air and prevent itching.  The pumice stone is great for callouses on feet, and I also use it around my ankle (I get callouses from the shoes I wear).  Overall a great product.  I'd recommend this as a gift, too.
B008HODSQE|3|not as nice as the more expensive hair... but thats to be expected.  i wanted it for a little more lenght and it does the job.
B0016S0Y4M|5|Keep this on my table with the car keys and use it daily
B006L1DNWY|5|I am actually thinking about ordering a couple more as gifts because of the quality. They look like they are really good.
B00JHV0REW|3|I like the bag, it is a good size and well made. I just wish it had a little pocket sleeve inside for q-tips and/or bandaids etc.
B000WHYBE2|5|this is the nipper you need......wife loves it!
B00A7007CE|5|I can personally say that this cream is one of the best of it's kind on today's market. My wife is very particular about the products that she uses and this one was purchased for her as per her recommendation. She's been using it for quite awhile now and is loving the results. There is no intention to switch to another brand as this one's fulfilling all her skin care needs.
B001TAHWIS|5|excellent walking cane . I have bad knees so it makes things easier!!
B00ANZOVAW|4|Apparently my hubby likes this shaver as it is identical to the one he wore out.  So I'd have to give it a good rating.  And I'm guessing he will buy the same when this ones hits the trash can.
B000ZMANRI|5|Love these extensions! I wear them pretty much everyday and they are wonderful. The pink is bright and the quality is great, very soft.
B00SDSCL62|1|Total Ripoff -Wont accept returns-Bottles say 2 oz and are 1/2 full
B000EQDJPS|5|I was blessed with oily skin. No lines at age 50... But with oily skin comes large pores.. I found Pores no more last year and have used this product ever sence. It is truly the best I've ever used. My pores are so small that I have friends asking me what I've done to my skin and saying that it looks so young and healthy.. I love this product and will use it for the rest of my life.. Thank you so much..
B00IYE26TM|5|Item as described and fast shipping - recommended
B00CCYOHPQ|3|Smells GREAT.  So-so for 48hr volume.
B0084A5P94|5|LOVE IT! i got the color Merino Mauve and it feels great on my lips. The color for this one doesnt last as long though but i only re-applied it once -3- super soft and it is a beautiful color, its a pale pink color ^-^ COMPLETELY recommend this, its a nice shade of pink and came a few days earlier than expected :) Great product for its price
B003WWL5QG|5|easy to fill, does not leak very happy
B00E7GUT3G|3|The stuff works but it is terribly expensive. There's other products that do the same thing at Walmart and Target. And you don't get all the extra samples of stuff that you didn't ask for and don't use
B00Y7ZVIY6|5|Okay, I'll state up front, I'm not a big makeup girly-girl.  But, I couldn't resist getting these lip gloss sticks for my granddaughters for testing and review.  Then, I decided to keep one back for myself and of course I chose my favorite color. Since I've had a life-long problem with chapped lips, I have to carefully choose which lipstick brand I will use and rarely use anything on my lips except the old tried and true.<br /><br />What I found when I tried this lip gloss from ACEVIVI was that my lips immediately felt as though they'd just been given some nourishment even as the description states.  In fact, I'm thinking about sneaking into my granddaughters' rooms and taking back the other colors.  Awesome, beautiful lip colors and the feeling is absolutely great.  The little mirror on the side with the LED light is simply the bomb!<br /><br />Sample received from ACEVIVI for testing and review.
B00AO4EL0C|3|I'm in my 30's but had the chance to try this out so I did. I really don't get the whole axe scent deal, some of their products have a strong scent which I don't like while others are minor and I do like them. This is one of the items that to me has the strong axe smell. Also, it's \\"hydrate\\" which means it's extra moist. For me it was too moist, so much so it made a mess as there was little substance to it.<br /><br />I prefer the sensitive formula of Dove men's post shave lotion, even the Dove hydrate, just because the scent.<br /><br />For me, I'm passing on this.
B00IT1ECBA|5|We bought this hand soap to use in our kiosk and LOVE it! It smells beautifully and it's very gentle to our hands. We certainly recommend!
B0049MA6RC|1|Does not work at all!  I probably should have been aware since it is such a cheap product, but them's the shakes -- learn from my experience and get something better!
B002RT724O|5|I can't get along without this stuff.  Love it!
B009IN9U10|1|I picked this sponge up at Wal-Mart excited to try it and happy about the price compared to the Beauty Blender.  I have had the same experience as many that mine split the first time I wet it.  I was so disappointed!  I will continue to use it until it is completely shredded, but each time I clean the sponge it splits in another spot.  I love the way it applies my makeup so it is unfortunate that it is of poor quality.  I will eventually invest in the Beauty Blender, but I wish I would have from the start!
B00007M0CP|4|I needed a new set of curlers because the set I had didn't have enough rollers for my thick hair. It wasn't until after I ordered these that I realized the ones I had already were also Conair! I am VERY happy with these curlers! They feel very familiar because of the other set I have...my only complaint is that I need more large ones than what is included in this set. However, now I'm heating up both sets, and FINALLY I can relax and set my hair the way I really WANT to!<br />I recommend these curlers, I think they're great. They heat up quickly, and well. You can control how hot they get with a heat setting (1-12). I would have to disagree with K. Johnson, too, regarding the 'flimsy plastic lid'. Reading her review nearly put me off buying these, but I find the lid is just fine. It's not thick plastic, but I don't see any need to be any thicker than it is....it does the job!
B003SKFE6E|3|Used this for keeping up short hair into a pony tail for jazz dance recitals for my granddaughter.  Works okay but not really any better than a regular max hold brand.
B006K9OQSC|3|I have watched videos on this and honestly, I'm still not entirely sure what I'm supposed to do with this.  I usually just end up with a tangled mess.
B0015KXNMQ|5|I went a little crazy and ordered three different bottles of orange oil from three different companies. I compared the three and YL was by a long shot the best smelling and the strongest smell as well. It is definitely you get what you pay for with oils. I did not have the competitor to compare and would be curious, but I am not ordering another bottle at this time.
B005DN30GU|5|It was exactly like the description. I am happy with my purchase. It arrived quickly. Hopefully I can get the lace to soften a little, but it doesn't look like that will be a problem :)
B001KYPZ4G|1|Do not use of you have any kind of rash! It may common knowledge but I had a small rash on the back of my legs from eczema and didn't notice so I used it anyways. Now I really regret it. I have chemical burns on the backs of my legs and under my arms and I didn't even keep on for 10mins. Do not use of you have eczema!!
B00AE9182Q|5|Love CHI products.
B00I2NZEBC|5|Great value.  Half what you pay at the salon for this product!
B003UKKHB4|5|I think the 3000 model is the sweet spot of Oral-B Pro range. More expensive models have more bells and whistles and cost even more, well into a $100+ range, but this one does everything you might want from a toothbrush.<br />While it is possible to brush properly with a manual toothbrush, it seems that vast majority of people brush wrongly when using it, using side-to-side motion. I rind that it is much easier to do a great job of brushing your teeth if you're using a power brush like this one. Timer works great and, especially at the beginning, helps you to time yourself. I love the charger BTW: it has no metal contacts (some of older power brushes had them) = no water risk.<br />The only con I've discovered: pressure sensor behaves very differently for lower & upper teeth. When brushing top teeth, it activates very easily (being forced down by gravity already) and that makes the red light go on all the time. But this is not really annoying.<br />Great brush, have recommended to couple of friends already.
B00BCWP0KU|5|CND has done an amazing job making some bright super fine glitters. They are a great quality product and will really make your nails sparkle.
B00JM8Z52O|5|Amazing quality wig. Some wigs can be kind of hard to put on but this one was pretty easy. It fits my head and is true to the picture. No difference in color. The two colors are two different layers, still completes the look though. Will surely buy from this seller again.
B009EXK2MU|5|I love these along with some other brands.  I'm able to add color or fun designs with out going in to a Salon and paying an unreal amount for 'color'....  Enjoy them, I sure do!!  Thank you Incoco Nail Polish!
B00140TXWQ|3|This is the first bed head product I've ever tried, and I was really hyped about it because I've heard such great things about the brand. After a couple of weeks of use my reaction to it now is...meh. It's not bad by any means, it's just not that great either. Maybe I haven't been using it long enough but I haven't noticed any great changes in my hair after I use it. One thing that bothers me is that if I apply a little too much of it in any area of my hair it hardens the strands and gives it that unpleasant &#34;80's hairspray&#34; feel. It does a decent job of smoothing fly aways, but I have other, cheaper products that provide the same effect. As for the split ends, like I said, maybe I just haven't been using it long enough, but I still notice split ends in my hair, and though I can't be sure (I can't exactly count them) I don't notice a lessening of the amount of split ends. I'm still gonna keep using it, but I don't think I'll bother with the Ego boost again, I'll probably try something like the After Party, which sounds a bit more interesting, and if that doesn't impress me I'll give up on Bed head altogether.
B006L21OSS|2|I bought this as I use the Herbal Essences \\"Drama Clean\\" and love it, but this co diction made my hair very oily.
B000JNQSIQ|5|Let me start by saying, I've never actually used these to cut hair on anyone's head.  That being said, I've used it as a beard trimmer, and a , a-hem, manscaper.  I'm not a hairy dude, but I like to trim a little here and there.  These things are perfect.  It comes with many different clips for those looking for different lengths of hair cutting.  They are color coded for convenience so you aren't staring at each black clip looking for the size.  It comes with scissors and a nice little case but I don't keep the clippers in their case, just the clips.  I wrap the cord around the clippers and leave it under  my sink.  Sometimes, the cord gets very wound up, which would be my only complaint, but other than that, I really like this.  It replaced an older wahl which I had for like 12 years.  Great price, and great quality.  Happy Clippings!
B001M0WERE|5|can't find in stores.  one of the best eye makeup removers around.  not too oily, and works quick and easy.  too bad the availability is so poor.  but YAY for Amazon for carrying it!!
B001LYYLJA|5|Admittedly the only reason I purchased this was due to having a couple which when doubled basically gave me the soap free.  Figuring this would be another bar soap that would end up placed in a drawer, I could not have been more wrong.  This soap is so fresh smelling and leaves your skin with no slimy soap scum.  I will be going today to buy enough bars should Dial decide to do what happens so often and that is to pull their best products making them impossible to find.  For anyone looking for a hypoallergenic bar soap that lives up to its name, this is the one.
B00F008GFQ|5|Very soft very nice！
B004RANK5Q|2|I was suprised with the very fast shipment, but if you very dark its not going to work.  It burned my skin and no I have a dark spot under my eyes.
B0006ZTEQK|5|thanks, as expected
B00B8Z2LRQ|4|Thanks to years of taking glucosamine/chrondriton/msm, I have very strong nails. However, the corners of my nails do peel a little on occasion. So I decided to give Pink Armor nail gel a try. I apply a base coat of the Pink Armor, then a coat of a more opaque nail polish like Wishful Pinking, then a top coat of Pink Armor. I get a look similar to the gel nail manicures I got at the salon years ago, without the hassle of the application and curing process. I do my nails twice a week and Pink Armor lasts well between applications. I will be buying more of this.<br /><br />The only con I've found is that putting more than two coats of the Pink Armor nail gel on your nails makes for a very funky pink color. So I limit it to a base and top coat.
B0012OM1MS|5|i love it good
B0083X2QF8|1|It did Slightly helped curb appetite but no weight lose. Bummer.  I was hoping for a jump start. Took as indicated.
B002JPE0DC|5|Nothing compares to this product!
B00150LT40|5|This dries literally in seconds, and is great when you're in a hurry or just impatient. It doesn't smell like nail polish though, the scent is a little strong.
B005ITRIOY|4|These arrived earlier than I expected, and as most of the Asian beauty products I've tried it worked well!<br />I would recommend using this after a shower so your pores are open and your face is wet, I've used these about 3 times so far and my nose always feels very soft and hydrated after. If you are in very hot weather and your sweating often these really will clean your pores well! Definitely will be purchasing these again!
B00871KNMY|5|Another thing I cant wait to use on myself and my clients. Really decent size for you ladies out there who love 3D nails.
B0086VIA1Q|5|Don't even consider using the generic alternative, these real Sonicare heads are the only way to go! They last longer and I notice a real difference in the way they clean.
B00EOZA48K|5|I had attached my veil to a pearl and diamond tiara.  After the ceremony, I took my veil off and wore this one to the reception.  It was perfect… awesome, delicate and just the right amount of hair decoration to compliment my ivory lace gown.
B00L4FNIA4|5|i wasted my money
B005JDPS0U|5|Makes my hair so smooth a touchable in this humid weather! Love it!
B000L998JY|5|It really works and fits in a small pursue. This is the only brand that truly works. I have it in every size and version.
B004WPHT1M|3|It has a musty odor.
B007SZCG0C|5|Just like any other women we intend to lose hair growth as we age. I have taken vitamins to regain my hair lose. I totally recommended this product if your trying to regain hair and confidence. It beats grom taking pills everyday. I love how i can just use this product in the shower.
B007Q37Z9I|5|So on my 24th bday,i decided to stop jumping from body wash and scent like a shameless junkie and narrow on 2 or 3. So reading these reviews i was kind of spectical (i mean rosemary in a soap?) ,but there is no way yardley can mess up  lavender so i ordered it anyway. This body wash is so awesome i feel like i could advertise it,no lie,the smell is not overwhelming at all,it is soothing,it foams perfectly and when i say the scent last,it last all night,i woke up the next morning to a nuzzling husband who declared &#34;this is the best a woman has ever smelled&#34; in a early morning voice (yay me), i plan on ordering the lotion,im addicted.
B00YAR86BY|4|My husband has been trying to convert me to the benefits of an electric toothbrush, so I was happy to take this opportunity to see how I liked this model. It turns out that my initial reluctance was confirmed -- I'm just cut out to use them.  There is a feature on this toothbrush that is supposed to ease new users into the transition, but I so disliked the buzzing sensation that I had no motivation to give it a try, especially given that some of the crowns in my mouth are almost 30 years old. Although the instructions are clear that the toothbrush is safe to use for my dental work, I decided I'd be happier with a regular toothbrush and some dental floss,  all things considered  My teeth did feel extremely clean.<br /><br />The story has a happy ending.  I passed it along to my husband, and he is really likes this toothbrush. His old brush was another Philips that he's had for five years. This brush has a smaller head and the size and angle make it easier to clean the teeth. The choice of three speeds makes it possible for it to be gentler than his older model (I am so whimpy I shudder to think  of the higher speeds -- I was testing it on the lowest setting). He didn't find the Quadpacer signal to be particularly helpful, but I can see where it would be quite useful to help kids develop better habits. The brush's body is slimmer and more comfortable to hold, and the case is useful and easy to clean. it takes up very little counterspace,, which I count as a very good thing.
B005PP1X4C|4|I had ordered this ink and was really excited about the new tattoo I'm getting. I mean, glows under black light?! How cool is that?!<br />But when it came in the mail, all I got was an empty bag with the packaging slip! So I sent Mix Wholesale a message explaining the situation and requesting a replacement. They responded that same day and sent out a new bottle. Now that I see the ink in person; I can't wait to see how it looks it under my skin!<br />I'm vary happy with how this company treats it's customers and will be doing busines with them again soon!
B0023UQIVU|5|I ordered this for my wife.  We live in a small town and are unable to find it locally.  It was nice to find it online, for less than I pay for it in a salon and so my wife got two for her birthday instead of one.  Thank you!!
B000VAWZ2U|5|I have been using one stick for the last 7 months. I am a woman, and don't shave daily, so I'm sure it probably lasts me longer than others. I am only about 1/4 of the way through the stick though, so I anticipate it lasting me at least a full year.<br /><br />I am pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to use this stick. I take it in the shower with me, wet the end, wet my legs, and smear the stick over my legs. I am able to shave with no foaming involved. It creates a nice slick surface as is. Lately I have been using a brush to rub a little, just to make it white so I can see that all my skin is soaped, but it doesn't seem necessary at all.<br /><br />I don't mind the smell of this stick at all, though it doesn't smell girly for sure. I suspect a nice smelling body wash on the legs when done would help the smell.<br /><br />For the price though, I will live with the smell. Between my recently purchased 12 pack of soap, and the 100 pack of blades, I might just be set with shaving supplies for the next decade.
B000FQOQ5Y|5|I'm 34 and I still breakout, and always had a hard time finding something that didn't dry out my face too much.  This stuff really made my face breakout less.
B00MNK9R5Y|5|Love the smell of this! I was worried it would have that sickly sweet, floral smell like some other argan oil products. This smells yummy like cocoa butter or shea butter. It's super smooth and creamy. I've used it once as a deep condition and then use it most showers as an every day conditioner (using a much smaller amount of course). You have to bee careful not to use too much or it can definitely weigh your hair down though. I lightly shampooed after the deep condition.
B00ARTK9NW|5|It took off all my make-up, even mascara and it didn't leave my skin greasy.  I will buy this again.
B004KVEY0M|5|I love this eyeliner, and have been using it for years. I buy the spiced chocolate color. I like it because it goes on incredibly smoothly. It can smudge if you rub your eyes, but otherwise its perfect. I never use the blending rubber because it just doesn't seem that necessary and it doesn't work that well. Also, keep the plastic cap! I once lost the cap and it did start harden and go on less smoothly.
B00B1O8FFG|5|AND THE EXTRA LIGHT COLOR ROOT TOUCH UP IS HARD TO FIND!  CLAIROL MAKES SUCH AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT & SO EASY TO USE.  I LEAVE IT ON ABIT LONGER THAN SUGGESTED TO TAKE CARE OF THE STUBBORN GRAYS. I USE THIS PRODUCT IN BETWEEN COLORINGS FOR PROFESSIONAL RESULTS!
B005KFTXOE|3|It's rather pricey, but I guess that it does it job all right. It's worth a shot if you need it.
B001JJBC9Y|5|These clippers work well. They're sturdy and sharp, and they get the job done with ease.    If you are a person who keeps his/her short, you could be saving a lot of money on haircuts, plus you can keep touched up / neat more easily than going back to the barber.    I only regret not getting them sooner. Think of all the money I could have saved!
B0050M8GMC|5|Last longer and smells the same as the abercrombie cologne
B000U04XEY|5|When I first purchased this at a local cosmetics store, the salesgirl told me not to buy it -- that it doesn't look good on anyone -- but one test application proved her wrong. It's exactly the shade I turn when I blush.  The silky texture and fine milling of the powder makes it go on smoothly, and the intense pigmentation means I use a very little amount when applying.  It lasts for a long time and looks totally natural.  If you have a light golden complexion like mine, this could be a great color for you.
B0061RDFP8|2|Come on!!!  I bought all three products...the leave in stuff, the white bottled conditioning shampoo, and this 3 minute 'miracle' stuff....<br /><br />This stuff is the best out of the 3 products, but it STILL doesn't get it as soft as my wife's salon bought REGULAR conditioner...<br /><br />For what you get in a bottle, save your money!!!!
B00XYP7UTW|4|Liked very much, but again wrong color. Will try again
B000H3I3Y0|3|Package came with goo all over it. I had to wash the tube to get it off. Luckily it didnt seem to affect the inside. Great color.
B0029Y9FZG|5|I have to say this flat iron lasted me about 9 years. It's worth every penny. I love it but it's time for me to replace it :)
B00IT5KAHQ|5|My neck feels smoother.  My eczema has improved.  The cracks in my fingers are improving. This is a good product and the company stands behind the delivery process, too.  My order had an error and it was rectified within 4 days.  Good product.  Good company.  I recommend both.
B00ABKHR3W|4|good
B003JN0L8Q|4|This a a swell black silicone refill pad--ly only caveat is it does not fit into my Revlon curler from a couple years ago.  Unlike another reviewer I've had no lash fallout: it releases lashes flawlessly curled.  I like the black so it won't become grey over time from light mascara residue which my white ones always did.  I bought it because another reviewer said it fit her Revlon curler: maybe she has a recent one.  Mine is a couple years old.  It absolutely does not fit and pops out.  Revlon is more fo the problem than these pads are, I'm going to look for another basic metal curler with plenty of refills since Revlon still carries theirs with just one refill pad.  Good luck with this!
B001AV50OO|1|I'm not sure if this was an old tube, but it had an &#34;off&#34; smell to it. I really didn't see a difference in my hair. I stopped using it, because of the odd smell. I don't know if they all smell like this.
B001BLZS3G|1|Looks great! long reach. Just what I wanted. Fell apart the first shower. The glue was a thin layer that did not go into the loofah fibers. On the other hand the wood part is well constucted, just useless.
B007M4D49Q|1|I thought I would get 10 individual packs as shown above but I got one pack with a bunch in there but didn't look like what  I thought I ordered. Would not order again
B0055EPL6O|5|These work great on removing callused and dry skin on your feet.  I gave up pedicures as my skin is thin and pedicures are often too rough and cause my feet to bleed.  I highly recommend these.
B00749QR9S|5|Good man tools. Good for travel. Good price ($23). Good tight case. They look and feel sturdy. Buy em'. I'm glad I chose these.
B00U3ZFR1Y|4|Overall, this is a nice product.  It has a soft scent and smooth texture, perfect for making lotions to add your own scents too.
B000JUV816|1|Hair dryer was defective. I had to return it. Seller expressed regret and helped make arrangements to return quickly.
B0058LTP8E|3|The only problem I have found with your product is it won't work on my new battery operated Oral B toothbrush that I wanted it for.
B00GWBR6BM|4|It works fine.
B004F0HOM8|5|love making head bands for kids with these. they don't snap like the cheap ones from walmart and dollar tree. better price too!
B00A3LVMMQ|4|It works and its nice.  A cheaper one would do the same thing, but this one is aesthetically very nice and sturdy
B000B5GWLK|5|Like me, if you've amassed a sizeable collection of lip balms in your search for the perfect balm, look no further.  This is it.  I can't say anything negative about it.  It lasts most of the day and when I put it on before going to bed, I wake up with soft lips.  Not to mention it smells delicious.<br /><br />I tried Whipstick and other than the fragrance, I wasn't too thrilled with that one.  It's not moisturizing enough and I have to warm it up a bit before I can apply it.<br /><br />Honey Trap goes on smoothly and it has staying power.  This will be the only balm I collect from now on.
B003PGX0H6|5|Love love love Mina
B000142P12|5|I have thin, fine hair and was having a lot of breakage and shedding. I got this product on a chance and used it after washing my hair. I sprayed it on, put setting lotion on top, and wrapped my hair.     The next day when combing out my hair, I was amazed to find that the breakage had completely stopped! I'm very surprised, and pleased. Nice fragance and easy to use spray bottle. I also use the Aphogee Damage Shampoo and that's good too.
B0077CNO1G|3|I purchased this item and tried it out right away. It comes with a variety of attachments which function in varying degrees. I do like this item, but the two things I do not like about it is that it is LOUD and the smell of argon gas is evident when in use. Not sure if this is normal. Aside from that it does give you a good shock and that feels good. If you can't handle the pain you can easily adjust the dial. Use it for an extended period of time and your skin will get red, but hey thats the price we pay to look fabulous. This is a good alternative to other popular models.
B004L60F54|1|What a piece of junk.  Don't even think about wasting your money, this is cheap, flimsy and broke apart when I touched it.  Never even got it into my hair!  Foreign made trash doesn't even deserve 1 star.
B0042PE9HE|5|a great cleanser, pure, natural and a natural alternative to all the &#34;chemical&#34; out there that are so unhealthy...happy with purchase
B0030O9LYY|5|I purchased this item over two years ago, and still have 99% of the jar left.  I really only use it when I want to try a very pigmented shadow, and it works great.  My shadow stays in place all night.  For the price, it does exactly what it says it will.  It is difficult to blend when using, so use very sparingly if you need to blend a lot.  The tiniest amount you can pick up on your finger.<br /><br />Its an awesome product, works as well as other primers I've tried, and it lasts forever.  Something that will last you years - at a great price!
B002YAL9EK|5|smells great ! And I love goatsmilk soap  - it feels great. I have always had it it without poppy seeds though
B000NKHNHK|4|once u see a pimple coming you place this the night before and when you wake up the pimpmle is almost gone. you can only put it on at night because it dries white like chalk. its not a entire face  application but a on spot treatment
B002JC9VKC|2|My dermatologist told me to use this about 10 years ago and I have been using it ever since. It is the only cream that really works for ultra dry body skin. Now if I could just find an equal for the face.
B003WR3QSG|4|I'm new to wet shaving so I was looking for items that were good but wouldn't break the bank, and so far this one does the job well.
B0037LOQQI|5|Good as always, 110 protects your face and skin from harmful rays, been using for a couple of years and it does what it supposed to do, i do believe that it acts like an AGE SHIELD! IT keeps your skin from getting wrinkles caused by the sun, apply everyday 20-30 min before going out into the sun......... (Miami sun over here so this is the right SPF for me) I'm glad i bought it from amazon, cheaper price than going to my local target.<br />Will Re purchase, condition of the item was new as described by seller (the box and the item itself), everything A-okay!<br /><br />Recommend it 100%
B007S9PUR4|5|Not in stores but you can still find this scent online at the bbw website.<br /><br />Love this lotion, it goes on nice and thick and very moisturizing but I do have to admit that my main reason for purchasing it is the fragrance.  To me it's completely addicting and very long lasting but I did also purchase the body mist so I should be good for the whole day.
B000J41AH4|3|I originally bought this item in hopes that it would add a scent to my organic hair spray which is just a mix of essential oils and fresh bottled water, but to no avail. i suppose it serves its purpose as an added nutrient to my mixture but i was really hoping for the smell. but all in all good for conditioning and moisturizing. :)
B00H6B8LHA|5|Love it....
B001O8NU3G|3|The friend loves this colonge and I could never afford to buy it for her full price so this price was fantastic to begin with.<br />It arrived quickly-only thing was the usual Lamb Gold Box Cover was missing and the underlying plastic was dirty--I cleaned it up just fine.<br />She will like it even with out the Gold Cover....
B009K2BEOK|2|I ordered this for a Christmas present for my girls.  When I opened the shipping box the glitter containers were rolling around on the bottom of the box, with three of them open.  I was very disappointed in all the duplicates.  The picture didn't show that there were as many duplicates as there were.
B000UVZU1S|5|Has improved the softness of my face.
B00ERF811O|5|bought it for a gift for a fussy friend and she loves it, nice soft scent but not overpowering.  Beautifully packaged, no wrapping necessary
B008622LMO|5|I bought this for my girlfriend who loves the smell of pepper corns.... This was one of the better purchases I have made, as the aroma is intoxicating!
B00CK0B26E|4|smells wonderful but not a large enough quantity for the high price
B00FXOPP08|1|I think I just dislike dry shampoo in general, but this one was extra baby-powdery.
B001H9289Y|5|excellent concealer, easy to use, long lasting and blends well. Would deffinetly recomend it to use along with other mineral products.
B0063H2PWA|5|great leave in conditioner, leaves hair soft and give it a shine. All you need is a little, because it may leave a white residue on hair. I used it on roller setting my hair have not tried yet when blowing drying. great product love Keracare.
B005S10A6A|5|I buy this every year.  It is a requested gift from the women in my family.
B005ZSHRFS|5|Great perfect, and mysin who is over 6fy4 fits in it
B002VLZHLI|5|Costco may run out from time to time; this is a bargain and Amazon keeps in stock -- if you do not have a membership this is the only alternative and it works well.
B000VP53IS|4|Smells great.
B0011DTPII|5|Prefect brush for defining brows.
B001VB8C2U|5|Very helpful product.
B004OJU990|5|What an awesome brush! Face lathers like a dream.
B00AELX08E|5|I love giving myself deep conditioning treatments as well as attempting to straighten my curly hair with rollers, I can do them both with this product. I find it's best for me to do it this way to minimize damage that may be done by flat irons & so on. I have only used it twice but i am so happy with the item. It's a must have for my crazy unmanageable  Latin curls!! Just buy it ladies I doubt you will be disappointed.
B0035Y8118|1|I purchased a the Serum, wrinkle eye cream, moisterizer and neck cream for over $100.00 thinking once again I'd eliminate those ugly eye wrinkles, believing once again in the FAST talking, female sale pitches.  Once again and being a first time user - the Elysee products and especially the eye cream is horrible and it does absolutely nothing for those unwanted, unneeded wrinkles.  Total waste of money and I will never purchase anything from this line again.
B004LXOJ3Q|4|I use it with the finger because the real color is too strong, but it's okey.
B005BOIOPS|4|Excellent product
B0085XZM02|5|Opium Rich Body Creme by YSL..<br />Is Simply the Best Fragrance I have ever had<br />the pleasure of using..<br />My favorite fragrance for well over 25 years..<br />there Is Nothing Else like it..in my Opinion..<br />Love!
B00I0YMWDG|5|Technically these were made at their EU factory in Poland and imported, but they appear completely genuine and I can't tell any difference.  They came packaged as four 4-packs and two 2-packs (not exactly as pictured), but 20 blades are still 20 blades.
B0012GPV0U|1|The sprite didn't work is so Bad ..could you send me a new sprite?..thanks I really like this product ..thanks again
B001D4FF66|5|Several days ago, I ordered the Sweet Mint Cleansing Conditioner (realizing the sweet mint almond is not recommended for my hair type [3b/c relaxed]), I ordered it anyway.  The product arrived in great condition the next day.  Yesterday, I decided to cleanse my hair.  After following the instructions, I noticed that my hair felt soft instantly.  The styling creme (which I ordered along with the conditioner) did not give my hair the same results as the conditioner had done...so I removed the styling creme and cleansed again.  After cleansing, I roller set my hair and got under the dryer.  My rollers were falling off, that is how soft my hair was once it dried.<br /><br />I have mild atopic dermitis on my skin, at times even my scalp tends to dry out and mimic dandruff.  Most probably, I would need to use another product to address this issue whenever dermititis occurs.  Nevertheless, I am very happy with Wen and so is my scalp.  BTW, the Wen products tend to make the hair oily, so IF you already have oily hair, this product might make your hair oilier -- since my hair lacks hydration and sheen this product is righteously for me. Thank you Wen!!!
B00HMEBRKO|5|take your time
B00I3PZ8QU|3|Still using them but not sure I've seen any improvement in my skin. Afraid to stop taking them just in case they are working.
B000067ETY|5|They worked out perfectly.
B00J80TH16|5|Great quality!  Used in bath fizzies and a pain relieving arnica lotion bar recipe.  Worked GREAT!!
B00S3ZM0F2|1|Bad quality!
B000BYSPFW|5|I discover Dr. Brandt's line of skin care while on a cruise this past summer. I forgot my moisturizer at home and needed a night cream and a cleanser so I got the Dr. Brandt line.  THe only other option was CLinique and quite frankly, I'd rather use something from my local pharmacy than that!<br /><br />I loved the refining cream.  The cleanswer was great too.  A few months after getting back from vacation, I ran out of my \\"cruise\\" supply. I simply starting using my old moisturizer.  Within a week or so, my skin looked AWFUL.  I can't explain it - just not \\"glowy\\".  I couldn't figure it out. Was it stress?  the food? What?  I realized I had ran out of DR.B. Product.  I just ordered another supply of this and can't wait to get it.<br /><br />BTW - I also use the Dr. B. TIme Arrest Laser Tight.  I lOVE this stuff. You won't see results overnight but  if you are consistent, you will like what you see.
B003156NH0|5|As expected
B000R9C0RU|5|It was exactly what I was looking for
B000SSDTOS|5|Well, I'm writing a review for nail clippers.  Clearly, I have too much free time.<br /><br />Anyways, this is coming from a man who clips his nails like a deranged child and has always used the $2 clippers from the checkout lane.  Oh man, are these things better.  I paid $10 for these and they are totally worth it.  First, they are so sharp that they clip my nail without leaving that rough edge that catches on everything.  In fact, they're so sharp that they will casually remove any skin you accidentally get caught in them because you don't pay attention.  Second, the little clip catcher is the reason I bought these and it's great.  My wife always looks like she's about to sign the divorce papers when I clip my nails on the couch and the shards go flying like spent casings being ejected from Rambo's machine gun.  This thing catches about 95% of the clippings and the only ones it misses are the ones that fall into my lap and that's not a big deal.  Finally, these clippers are very nicely made and easy to handle so even a clothed ape like me can clip his nails without dropping the clippers or fighting with the folding mechanism.<br /><br />Look, you can either buy 5 sets of cheapo clippers that render your fingers into tender pink stubs or you can buy 1 clipper that will probably last you forever and won't really require taking out a second mortgage.  Just buy these things, already.
B001IAG7G2|4|Good, I use it as gifts for my friends.
B00HOQDKG4|5|So good really
B004MYDU9I|4|Love the scent! Kind of a salty beachy smell
B000B9N0AM|5|A Great little bottle for travel in carry on bag! I Might have to get another! Thank you so much!
B0012RURYO|5|Great
B009J1412O|5|I love what this is doing to the &#34;dry&#34; air wrinkles I get on my face in the colder weather.  And it smells fabulous!
B003BOIAJU|5|If your skin is dry this is the best product around.  I have tried many other products but this is the one I like the best.  It is very moisturizing but still very light and not too heavy.  Great product.
B002MGYH40|5|This has a lovely scent.  Love it!
B0007CXYAE|1|the paul Mitchell detanglerr is soooo good when its not so old its now white and smells old.... which is what I received<br />The Detangler is yellow and smells so nice, mine was very old, BUT very quickly I received a replacement which was perfect<br />velinad
B001G7OCSM|4|I purchased this for my 13 year old daughter, she uses it twice a week.  There is a significant decrease in her acne. I do believe you have to use all four products (Acne treatment kit) in order to see improvements! Bottom line it does assist with her acne prevention.
B00BPNR51I|5|OK well I do like color eye and lip  pencil but it didn't have any  glitter in it but I still like it u dont always get what u see
B008RQNFIS|5|It protects from harmful skin rays and one looks fresh and not of lots of make up in hot temp area in summer you do not look over made and like your face will melt along with regular make up
B007FXZZWI|1|Not sure if what I received maybe old or what.  However this goes on very, very dry.  It is a very hard dense deodorant that does not apply very well.  Not able to use because of the hard solid very dry texture.  Definitely would not buy again or recommend.
B00HMZ8IG4|5|This wig is awesome! I've purchased over 15 cosplay wigs from Amazon, and this one is one of the thickest, fullest wigs I've purchased! Looks exrcaly like the picture, and it's so full even when you bring some of it forward to the front, there is still plenty of hair left to give a full look to the back. The bangs can be side swept or kept straight across.
B000C2370G|5|My favorite men's fragrance since 1974.
B001IAEIXG|5|A-Ok
B000GG85DM|5|This is the best body bronzer on the market.  I am very pale and thus have used countless tanners and bronzers over the years.  While this is not per se a self-tanner, it stays on so well that you can get away with wearing it for more than one day.  The product gets you looking about as close to perfect as you could be.  Like other reviewers, I have used this on my arms and other areas with great results.  This product rubs off the least compared to other products - especially if you use a towel to wipe off any excess bronzer after you are done.  It does not have any sort of sticky consistency, so it dries very fast.  Highly recommend, you'll look super hot at the beach!
B001ET78QK|5|Very natural colour. I am Armenian but very pale, and yet I feel confident enough with the application of this product to buy the dark version. Highly recommend - I use it every day. Makes the booty and thighs look sleek and toned!
B00H2WYAHS|2|My hair is too short, fine, and thin for this design.  It slipped out of the spirals.
B009GIOVLG|5|I hang it in the shower and use it on my face.  I started out needing the very soft brush, but now regularly use the regular one included.  I have never used the larger one for the body, but I'm sure it would work well, too.
B005OU4J6C|5|My first time use Asian BB cream. It's right for my oily skin. It covers like foundation. It really require small pump to cover everything! A little goes along way!
B002G392OE|5|This is the 2 nd time ordering, an awesome product for dry overworked hair..definitely a hair saver! I highly recommend !
B00FQF9NOI|4|Beautiful watch.
B004T8HHH8|5|I have nothing to say other than something I have been told all of my life, and this entirely rings true:<br /><br />You get what you pay for.<br /><br />Enough said.
B004KT8CAW|3|shampoo is harder t get out then the conditioner....
B001W2K51O|4|The bar shampoo arrived promptly. I have not used the product yet as  I bought it for travel so I would have more room in my quart carry on   baggie for other liquids.
B00IRUSAPM|5|Great product, and great seller!
B002DPS40I|5|Awesome price for an amazing product...
B003KUEWBA|5|Another great product from Nature Babycare.  The size is good, not too big or small, and can easily fit in other brands' tubs if you or your toddler wants to pull it out of a refillable container. Because it is flushable, the material can be torn easily if you are too rough with it.
B002ZG94UY|2|Not worth it. I think time helped more than anything. Basically just a lotion. Smells nice but has parabens.
B001T0HHBK|5|This is my new favorite tool! depending on the size chunk of hair and how fast you move the tool down will control the amount of curl. I can get cute curled ends or full curly hair with this tool so fast. I am done with curling irons/curlers etc!
B000PHFWGK|4|For a self tanner, i was really pleased with this product.  It is inexpensive, and worth the price.  It takes a couple of coats to reach a desired color but it isn't streaky or orange.  make sure you spray the tops of your feet though a little or you get a line at your ankles!    i would recommend, for sure.
B0050HO9MI|1|The head is very flimsy and the blades do not seat correctly to provide a good cut, not to mention it takes like 15 or more days to come from China.  I do not recommend this product.
B00B83JLPI|5|These Plates stamp flawlessly.  With 63 images per plate and each one stamps perfectly , you can't go wrong. I highly recommend these plates. Great for beginners or advanced stampers. Tons of fun here.
B0053A8NVA|4|Well here comes the embarrassing talk ladies...<br />Anus whitening! (There I said it!)<br />Anuses are natural but also they are impeccably disgusting and just &#34;ICK!&#34;<br /><br />My sister has snickered and made a running joke about me wanting to bleach &#34;the thundah from under&#34;.<br />Also most forums that I've read online attacks people for even caring about such a thing and even slanders people like us for making this practice a new standard of beauty.<br /><br />However, besides the snickers, jeering and pep talks you have to do what you want!<br /><br />In which, Divine Derriere does work pretty well for your butt whitening quest. It does what it's supposed to do. With the first bottle, divine derriere took me up a few shades. Now I've been lazy and this bottle has lasted me decades, so it can be assumed that I didn't use it religiously in which could mess up your results.<br /><br />Personally though, (and hopefully not too graphic) I was hoping that my netherzones would look just more like all the rest of my skin. Divine derriere just makes your anus a pinker hue and doesn't even out the skin tone.<br />Also for the price of about $40.00 on eBay (I can't really find it anywhere else) for the bleaching cream and nothing else. It can be a tad pinch painful to dish out for such a teensy little 2.0 oz container which would have been gone in about a month, if used everyday. Also the fact that if you want major results you will have to buy multiple bottles makes me slightly sad too.<br /><br />But you have to remember that you could be doing this professionally which would cost SO much more. So this really is the cheap way. I'd rather have the expensive product that works versus a cheap product that wastes my time.<br /><br />However, with a good scrub here and there it works pretty well!<br />It smells great, it's very easy to use, and I would recommend it.
B00JX979CQ|5|I USE THIS INSTANATURAL 100% PURE EMU OIL FOR MY WHOLE BODY.  SPECIAL MY FOOT SO DRY.  MY FOOT ALWAYS VERY DRY AT WINTER.  BUT THIS OIL I BEEN USE FOR 2 WEEKS IN COLD DAYS AND MY FOOT FEEL GREAT.  THANKS!<br />I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.
B0089E3JG6|1|This product is nothing more than petroleum. I would not buy this product again.
B005BQLXWM|1|It leaked.
B000OP1WH6|5|This stuff smells like awesome. Some people suggest the smell fills up a room it is in. Good. Then I don't have to smell all the crappy soaps my roommates have that try to compete with it.<br /><br />One concern with this soap is that you run the risk of become a werecowboy. Sometimes after using this in the shower I lose hours of my life. I wake up by a campfire, the embers burning low, bottles of empty whiskey strewn about my feet, with a loyal horse waiting nearby. I find myself asking why I came out West, why I thought I would find my fortune here. I have vague memories of my wife and children dying of cholera, of that gunshot wound I suffered at the hands of Little Boy Slim, the infamous bank robber. I wait until the memories fade, hop on the saddle, and ride into the dawn.
B00O0HW9T4|4|My old skin loves it.
B007SG2QT2|5|I love this stuff. It does not cake and it adds moisture to your hair.
B009XY1SKK|1|It doesn't fit for womens razor.
B00CZ4H5H0|5|Used it for many years and I love it!
B008VF55WE|5|This is the color I expected and I take it to the salon when I get a pedicure. Looks awesome.  arrived as promised, looks great.
B004Y9L6WE|5|Love the shimmering color
B00F4S5GZ2|5|I am very pleased with this purchase. I like the various modes of play and although I added a small portable external speaker, the speaker in the unit isn't bad.<br />The case is not the best quality--feels rather thin--plastic but I traveled with it, used it often and my twin 19 month old granddaughters played with it repeatedly--and it's still holding up fine--not even a crack in it!I<br />I bought it primarily to play CDs for the baby girls while away on Christmas vacation but we also used the DVD and radio  option,<br />all which were good.<br />The screen clarity and focus is excellent for such a small device and price.<br />I would recommend this to anyone needing a small portable player!
B000FIFH46|5|Excellent product
B005XPKCEQ|5|My wife loves it.
B001O95MZ4|2|Too small for me.pLanning to exchange if I can
B00V7PFNSG|5|Great product!!! Would definitely buy again!
B0037BI736|3|The tapes really work but i used two on each breast to be sure that they will hold for the entire evening! and they did the job. I gave 3 stars for they hurt my skin and take a little with them  when i removed the tape leaving a scar! However, i think being careful when removing them next time may make the process more satisfying.
B0047ERRLK|2|LOVE the color, but it's drying!!!  You need to constantly apply lip gloss to prevent dry lips and flaking.<br />The product will leave a ring around your lips as the color starts to wear-off in the center causing you to look ridiculous!<br />I wish the product were different because the color is exactly what I have been looking for.
B000F4USF8|1|just for only 0n week
B00CNFF442|5|This green color is great..got lots of compliments on it. Super fast shipping too. I wore it to \\"Wicked\\" and it was perfect! Thanks.
B00597U3HE|5|I wish this wasn't so expensive because it is my favorite shampoo and I can only afford to buy it once or twice a year.  I only use it a few times a month as a treat for my hair.
B00O68O1NO|2|The quality looks ok.  The quanity states 6 count and I received 1 pair.
B004KNAH7E|5|great
B007ML0DGQ|5|Instead for throwing away my eyelash curler, I was able to use the rubber cushions to replace the old ones.
B0034UBHNM|3|I would rate this product as just okay...I put it one everyday, regardless if I was going to be out of the house or not. It did feel great going on, made my skin feel soft but I have to say that was about it. I did not notice any improvement overall in the look or feel of my skin. It did make a great moisturizer under makeup but for the same effect, I could have bought a much cheaper cream honestly. I would not buy it again
B00006ANDK|4|I have sensitive gums and am so glad I bought these extras.  They don't feel too flimsy but are soft and feel very good.  I get a great clean with my new toothbrush and heads.  I recommend.
B002DOSSYG|2|You might think that you're getting the bang for your buck with this 32-piece brush set, but honestly, some of them are just duplicates. There seems to be at least 2 of everything and do you really need that many? The eyeshadow brushes they have are crap and not very good at shading. They don't have any good blending brushes, and there's not even a foundation brush in sight!<br /><br />These are better off used as artist brushes than make-up ones.
B00B2B2VGW|5|Excellent product.  As with other reviews this product appears to begin working after just three washes.  Never had hair loss problems until middle age (menopause).  I have started washing my hair every other day.<br /><br />To use:  Wet  your hair, apply the Phytoworx shampoo and allow it to sit on your hair (scalp line area) for three minutes.  I then apply a dime size amount of Loreal Everpure Sulfate Free Shampoo for the lather.  Rinse, rinse, rinse and then apply a small amount of sulfate free conditioner (of course rinse that out too).  Wonderful results!  Hair loss is significantly less.<br /><br />Have recommended this to friends with the same issues.
B000FTYOQC|5|fast shipping, good price, arrived in good shape. one of the few items i can use on hypersensitive skin. does not last as long as regular soap but, for reactive skin, i think it is great.
B0039LMTHE|2|i use it because the better one is too expensive...
B006GQSS7O|5|I love this lip butter. I so wish it hadn't been discontinued. It goes on sheer, so it is very wearable even though it is lavender. It looks very polished and pretty.
