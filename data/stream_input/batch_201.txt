B000002NHN|5.0|You've read all the reviews. Ditto, ditto, ditto.<BR>It is interesting that while Evangelical Christians are producing musical rubbish thinking that pagans will flock to their churches to rock out with Jesus, the &quot;Pagans&quot; are producing music like this with beautiful melodies, colorful lyrics and vocals like angelic crystal. There's no way in the world that I am going to bow down and pray to a tree but the music of artists like Loreena McKennitt speaks to my soul better than any of the barf bag material I hear from the &quot;Contemporary Christian&quot; musicians.<BR>On this excellent CD, the worst of the best is &quot;Marco Polo&quot;. Best track is &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; - just an incredibly beautiful piece of music.<BR>All the tracks are good to marvelous. Fifty years from now, if you are in an old folks home listening to a radio station that plays &quot;classic new age oldies - hits from the turn of the millennium&quot;, this will be one of the CD's you'll hear from every day.
B00005NI5Y|2.0|First off, I love Bob Dylan. However, has anyone stopped stroking his ego long enough to realize how bad this album is? It has one good song on it, &quot;Mississippi&quot; and that was written for Sheryl Crow. I wish she had sung this version as well because it would be much better than hearing Leon Redbone sing it. What is Dylan doing with his vocals on this album? Give me Nashville Skyline anyday of the week. Also, Tweedle-Dee is about the most ridiculous song ever penned. I know that it's probably really deep and about the 2000 election or something, but its called Tweedle Dee. I think I'll write a song about Humpty Dumpty and see if Columbia will market it as a topical song about 9-11. It's interesting to see how forgiving we are of aging rock stars. The longer one stays in the music industry, the more we are willing to tolerate bad music. Neil Young and Mick Jagger anyone?
6305736650|4.0|\\"It's the stuff that dreams are made of\\"<br />Okay, so that's a quote from a different Bogart movie. But if one thinks about it, that applies to this movie as well. The casting in this movie is perfect. I mean could we think of anyone else better for the lead roles besides Bogie and Bergman? Had it been Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan, this movie would have been forgotten in a week (Not saying that they weren't good actors, just wrong for the parts).   <br />But there are many other elements that all work together and are what makes this movie so great. Perhaps it's the sharp, crackling dialogue. Maybe it is the impressive cinematography and set design. Michael Curtiz's direction or Max Steiner's music, perhaps? Maybe it is the colorful supporting characters played by the likes of Claude Rains, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Or it could just be the countless memorable scenes (Your Pick. My favorite, apart from the ending, is the duel of the French anthem La Marseillaise and the Nazi song Die Wacht am Rhein), but none of which could have been possible without the elements described above.    <br />Although this is good quality DVD, I think a film on the level of excellence and popularity like Casablanca should get more respect than this. The film itself, for being nearly 6 decades old, looks great, although I did spot occasional scratches and grain. There were times, however, when I needed to turn up the sound volume, but it sounded  clear and was free of unwanted noise. <br />Extra wise is where this DVD comes apart though. There is the original trailer and several bonus trailers for other Bogart movies. The main highlight is an impressive 30 minute documentary called \\"You Must Remember This\\", hosted and narrated by Lauren Bacall. But here is where my complaints begin. Throughout the documentary are shown (According to the film cover) \\"Recently unearthed outtakes\\". However, such outtakes, if they are so important, are not shown as a separate feature but rather are on the documentary. Mostly, however, as a backdrop during the credits or while a certain scene is being discussed. These outtakes could be bloopers, test footage or even deleted scenes. Isn't that important enough to allow a separate extra itself (Perhaps with audio commentary or summary captions)? Also, there should have been some other extras, like  Production Notes or a booklet or perhaps a photo gallery or commentary from historians or film critics. Come on, if Armageddon can get a deluxe, 2-disc special edition from Criterion, than so should Casablanca.  <br />The DVD is worth buying just for the movie alone. But if you desire absolute perfect picture and sound quality or a lot of extras, wait for another edition, whenever that should come.
B000003S16|4.0|Some rough edges for sure, but for any fan of King Crimson or art/prog in general, there is a LOT of fine material here and I recommend it highly. Just to clear up a few points from other reviews: That's Peter Hamill screeching on Disengage and Daryl Hall crooning on North Star. That's Narada Michael Walden not Phil Collins drumming on Breathless. Also Fripp had nothing to do w/ Peter Gabriel I. He hated the production on that album and convinced Gabriel to let him re-record the stripped down Here Comes the Flood (which includes a blatent missed note on the piano). Anyway, a great album, buy now.
B000002A46|5.0|This, in my opinion, is one of Mariah's best. Very touching, heartwarming, and altogether awesome, this album is an absolute MUST for any Mariah Carey fan. And Mariah doesn't take a break from writing her own songs here--she wrote a few songs on this CD, including &quot;All I Want For Christmas is You&quot; and &quot;Jesus Born on This Day.&quot; In my opinion, &quot;Jesus Born on This Day&quot; and &quot;Oh Holy Night&quot; are the two best tracks on this album, but of course, I liked all her other songs, too. Definitely buy this one--I can almost totally guarantee that you won't be sorry. It's a milestone in Mariah's singing career! =)
B000003S1A|4.0|I've always enjoyed this album, though probably not as much as some die-hard Crimson fans.  The Sheltering Sky and the beautiful Matte Kudasai are my favorite cuts and are probably the most melodic.  Certain parts of the disc, however, seem to be technique for technique's sake, without much emphasis on chord progressions or melody.  Don't get me wrong, it's still great fun to listen to, as these guys are all EXCELLENT players, but doesn't speak to my heart like a great melody can.  Having said this, this disc is well worth buying for the uniqueness and spirit of adventure therein.  These guys played what they felt despite current trends and for that they are to be applauded.
B00000IQBL|5.0|A great movie for those of us who want more 'real stuff' on-screen when it comes to war movies. As a combat veteran, I am tired of the usual 'go for glory' dribble fed us by Hollywood and called war films. In real life combat, nice guys get hit and killed on a daily basis. (Some times it may be a squad leader or your best friend, but some-one has to step in and take his place no matter how hard it might be to see some-one you love like a brother fall). This movie shows how and why average young men are trained and sent to do what others do not want to do, in places others do not want to go. This film mirrors, somewhat, my experiences both in training and combat. A 'must see' movie for those who want insight into real life and war.
B00005RFVL|4.0|This CD gives me yet another reason to wonder why Robbie Williams has never made it in the US the way he has elsewhere.  While this is without a doubt very different from his other CDs, it's also an undoubted success.  The duets with Nicole Kidman, Jon Lovitz and Rupert Everett are reason enough to buy it (who knew Jon Lovitz had such a smooth, sweet voice?), and the songs he does on his own are quite charming.  As with all of Robbie's albums, there is a hidden track at the end, this one featuring outtakes from the recording sessions.  On this CD, Robbie proves (as if we had a doubt) that he really can sing, and his phrasing on some of the songs is just lovely.
B000003TA4|5.0|nirvana has got to be one of my favourite bands ever! and no offence but i'd just like to say that \\"An 8-year old music fan from None Of Your Beeswax\\" has no idea because every song on the album is a classic and something in the way is one of the very best! nevermind is very easy to listen to for anybody. from the ever popular \\"smells like teen spirit\\" which i guarantee will cheer you up no matter what, to the mellow, soft and quite depressing \\"something in the way\\" every song has its own feel and you will not be disappointed with it. buy it or you're missing out on something amazing!
B00005QZ7U|1.0|People told me how bad it was but I just didn't believe.  Once I saw the movie (actually just half because I could't stand it) I understood what everybody meant.  Stay away from it.
B000059TEP|5.0|This was an amazingly beautiful movie!<BR>Very good for people like me who like tearjerkers.  It was funny, thrilling, and enchantingly romantic and sad in one movie!  Demi Moore, Whoopi Goldberg, and Patrick Swayze all do an excellent job in portraying their respective characters.  Wonderful movie for almost anyone (especially with the Holidays coming so soon!).

6304806426|5.0|The first time I saw this movie in the theater in December 1996, I walked home in a daze.  Not only was the cinematography breathtaking, the movie score was a sure Oscar bet I thought; I was right.  It was a shoe in for best picture.  My only regret is that Ralph Fiennes did not get Best Actor award.  This is one of the finest movies of this century.<br />Five years later, I am upgrading my old tired VHS copy to DVD.  I have just finished watching it for the eighth time, and am blown away by the level of intricacy in Minghella's project.  There are so many layers, and I am continually amazed by the beauty, intimacy and depth of the characters and the storyline.
B00005NW02|5.0|SOAD's 2nd album is a triumphant response to their 1st album. No one puts together an album of beats and riffs and lyrics like System of a Down (SOAD). Although all the tracks are winners, I found &quot;Aerials&quot;, &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;, &quot;Forest&quot; and others to be worth the price of the CD alone. For you &quot;behind the scene&quot; buffs, get the Limited Edition CD to see the making of this album.
B000002KIK|3.0|the first half of this album is terrific, but the second half<br />shows the original BLACK SABBATH at their worst and contains<br />some of their most horrible songs ever with SHOCKWAVE, AIRDANCE<br />and BREAKOUT and SWINGING THE CHAIN. the only bright spot on the<br />second half is the vocal bridge on OVER TO YOU. the singing on<br />SWINGING THE CHAIN is very un-SAB like. i don't think that BILL<br />WARD or OZZY sing on it; i think that it's DAVE WALKER that's<br />singing.<br />  the first half of the album is wonderful,however; and<br />features some great singing from OZZY. the title track is one of<br />the most upbeat songs they ever did and has a wonderful guitar<br />solo from TONY IOMMI. the two songs that follow are also top-<br />notch SABBATH tunes,even if the song titles and lyrics are not<br />typical for SABBATH.<br />  if you buy this, buy it on LP form so you don't have to<br />listen to side two.
B000002LBH|5.0|A fine collection of music by Morrissey, Marr and the rest of &quot;The Smiths&quot;. Its variety of tunes and lyrics makes this CD a &quot;keeper&quot; for all times.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Got this CD for Christmas. I've only heard the song &quot;How you remind me&quot; on the radio. After listening to the whole CD. I love it! There's not a bad song on it! Buy it! You won't be disappointed. The only bad thing about the CD. There's only 10 tracks on it. Just under 40 mins. of total music. But there all EXCELLENT!!!!!
B00003CXTG|4.0|Pearl Harbor was such an outstanding movie. The actors did a great job and it retells the story from Dcember 7th perfectly!
B000051YD6|2.0|I am very disappointed with this recording.  Like too much of Davis's recent recordings, it is excessively &quot;well-behaved.&quot;  Too slow, too little attention to the musical &quot;line&quot;--to keeping the piece moving.<br />To hear the great Claudio Arrau at his best, I strongly recommend his 1964 recording with Bernard Haitink conducting the Concertgebouw Orchestra (on Philips, I think).  I recently came across that, and it's spectacular.
B000000ISD|5.0|Although you may already own 'War' on cd,album or cassette. It is well worth getting a hold of this as the sound quality is so superiour to every other previous issue of this title.<br />The sound is crystal clear and the packaging is so much better but the bonus that goes almost always unmentioned about this is that songs like 'Seconds' and 'Like a song' are longer versions.<br />A bit of a luxury to your average collection but well worth having.
0679409920|4.0|The plot of &quot;The Human Factor&quot; unfolds carefully, like a good spy thriller, but it's not filled with a wad of messy details or names.  The main character is a man who has staked all for the love of a woman of another race, and he is trying at all times to prevent this risk from catching up with him.  Although the plot takes place during the Cold War, and the machinations involve the US, UK, USSR, and apartheid South Africa, the story is highly contemporary and relevant.  It's also gripping, intelligent, and heartbreaking.
B00005OWIU|2.0|I simply love this soundtrack. As I listen to it at this moment, I can just hear the quality that's put into each track. Almost all of them have the same basic theme, but variations of it are thrown in to give each song a unique touch. My favorite has to be &quot;The Quidditch Match&quot;. It may be eight something minutes long, but it's got a feel of excitement in it. What's great about these songs is that if you've seen the movie once or twice, you can see the scenes being played out with the music, because the music is obviously straight from the movie. I think this is definitely a great one to buy, especially if you appreciated the great music of the movie.
0679720200|3.0|This powerful, disturbing book was better served by the eccentric translation English readers were used to than it is by this parched new one.<br />There are passages where this translator is so literal, he literally takes the French grammatical structure and dumps it into English with no filter, when rearrangement would actually make the point better.  You just want to strangle him sometimes.  He took a fine wine and turned it into a raisin.<br />--And no, it doesn't read like that in the original French.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink has managed to rise above the one-hit wonder status and prove a loy of people wrong and bring us a follow up album that is better then her debut.  Missunderstood, is a step forward and scompletely different from her roots, and she has done it with style.  My favourites tracks are Get The Party Started, Just Like A Pill, Numb, Dear And Diary and Respect.  This album is worth having and if you didnt get it for christmas thn i recommend that you go out and buy it
0385505833|1.0|The only reason I bought this book is because I had read and liked some previous books by Grisham. I definetely don't recommend it! It is a shallow book, nothing special about it but most important, clauses like &quot;he wasn't dark at all&quot; a comment that makes a dark! expected Peruvian suddenly handsome and &quot;he moved up another notch&quot; because he had been educated abroad in England (Peru is not abroad??) are unacceptable.<br />Grisham dropped more than a couple of notches!!
B0000041Q3|5.0|There is no doubt about it. The superstars in this Turandot delivers the goods absolutely. Sutherland's indescribably scruptuous voice is excellent as the princess of China. As good as she is here, she is even more commanding in the roles of the bel canto heroines such as Lucia, Norma, and Sonnambula. In those relms she has are no rivals at all.<BR>I actually find some of Sutherland's high notes ever so slightly thin here. It is still more than adequate for Turandot, but believe it or not, she can do even better than this.<BR>Pavarotti was pretty young when he recorded this, and he sounds like a classic Italian tenor in the tradition of B. Gigli. A superb lyric tenor who became an even bigger star than La Stupenda ( but then his star got eclipsed by still another tenor - guess who? ). At the height of his power here, he really had the potential to be one of the all time greats in the tenor department. He certainly had it all, up to high D as he demonstrated flawlessly as Arturo in Bellini's Il Puritani ( with Dame Joan ).<BR>Ok, now Caballe. She has the most control in breath support of all the contemporary lyric sopranos. So they say Tebaldi had a wonderful pianissimo? Get real, there are no comparisons. Caballe can really sing in the upper register in FF or pp. This Liu has everything, a true display of Caballe shere mastery in the art of bel canto in a Puccini opera. Check out Caballe's Puccini recital on angel.<BR>Mehta. He is aided by engineers that produce some of the best sounds that has yet come out of decca's studios. I checked out the date of the recording - 1971? Sounds digital to me, for sure. And Mehta takes advantage of this. The orchestra makes some mighty noise!<BR>So I really would recommend this Turandot. There are other excellent ones out there also. But, to my taste, this one my favorite.
B00005QDW1|5.0|ok people...to all those who say that theres only one verse and its the chorus all over again heres what i have to say to you: you're wrong!  and to those people who say that it sounds like Briteny Spears: just because she breathes loud into the microphone doesnt mean she wants to be Briteny.  OOOO shes breathing into a mike lets exile their CD's! <BR>have they even bought the CD?! i downloaded the songs of the net before i bought it and it was just the chorus over and over.  Then I bought the CD.  Surprise Surprise it wasnt just the chorus! theses songs are so wonderful! the choruses arent repeated over and over but they are full of lyrical content! dont listen to the people who say that the songs dont have any words cuz their so wrong! my favorite songs are<br />dont let me down-a more new wave punk song that is VERY catchy. it  this is the kind of song that no doubt is known for. just like its from tragic kindgdom<br />hey baby-how could  you not like this song?! if you havent heard it yet all i have to say is &quot;have you been living in a box?!&quot;<br />running-think of dont speak with just the guitar and tons os synth! this song is so caring and heart felt how could you not like it?!<br />platinum blonde life-this song is is not a dance hall song. its pure no doubt and reminds me of tragic kingdom. kind of like &quot;sixteen&quot; <br />and to those people who dont like dance hall dont worry.  Theres tons of rock elements and the sounds that we're all acustomed to when thinking about no doubt.
0446672653|1.0|From a style viewpoint, the writing is at quite a low level.  You get the feel that the author is trying to &quot;talk&quot; to you, but it is unconvincing.  On top of this, there seem to be logical flaws to the story being told by the author (which he claims to be true).   One of the flaws that stands out in my mind begins with a character in the book who is recalling a past life.  The character is speaking through this past life persona in the first person, yet refers to the year as some date with a B.C. attached to the end of it.  How would &quot;someone&quot; living in this era ever know to refer to the year as B.C.  Nice try Weiss.
B00000G3PA|3.0|Armageddon is not my favorite movie, I will admit.  It is highly improbable, fairly predictable, overly-patriotic, and emotionally manipulative.  But in its defense, anyone who sat down to watch this movie expecting Oscar material was a fool to begin with and deserved to be disappointed, and certainly had no grounds for writing some of the absurdly critical reviews that have been submitted to this forum.  For heaven's sake, it's a Bruce Willis movie; of *course* things are going to be blown up.  It's an action movie; of *course* it's going to be male-dominated, and the one or two female characters will be there solely to provide a romantic interest for a male protagonist and/or to provide eye candy for the predominantly male audience.  You didn't have to sit down to watch the movie to conclude the plot is improbable; just reading that it's about drilling on an asteriod while scanning the back of the box in the store would tell you that much.  And people of different ethnicities and nationalities were not nearly as grossly and offensively stereotyped as the characters in other recent sci-fi movies like Star Wars Episode I.<br />Armageddon is what it is.  It's an entertaining, visually impressive, over-the-top action movie.  And with smart actors like Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi, and (arguably) Ben Affleck, it's smarter and funnier than most other big brash blow-em-up flicks.  Heck, do what a lot of college kids do--sit down to watch it with a beer or two, and every time there's a gratuitous shot of a US flag, take a drink.  Maybe you'll loosen up a bit and enjoy big flashy Hollywood movies for what they are:  entertainment.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Filmed in wide screen(16x9 HD), super picture clarity, Overwhelming audio (5.1 or 2.0). I used Frampton's DVD concert as my benchmark up to this point. This one meets or surpasses it.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Nothing but great things about this album. All of the songs I love, and continue to listen to. I mean, if this tells you anything, I even listen to the intro. I can't believe how perfect this album is. Slipknot changes the sound to every song, therfore it isn't easy to get sick of. My favorite tracks include (Sic), Wait &amp; Bleed, Surfacing, No Life, Liberate and Spit It Out. Slipknot is one of the premier bands out there. All albums are great, and if you get the chance to see em live, don't miss out. (Also, if possible, backstage passes are worth it. The guys are mad cool, especially Corey &amp; Shawn!)
B00005QDW1|5.0|&quot;Rock Steady&quot; is the 4th No Doubt album. The EXTREMELY catchy CD is actually pretty good; i've been a fan for a long time and it's okay. i graded the songs with letter grades, so her it goes.<br />1) intro- this is basically just the chorus to &quot;rock steady.&quot; A<br />2) hella good- i don't like this song too much,  it's kinda dark and too long.  B<br />3) hey baby- this is the first EXTREMELY catchy song, and it's <BR>great to dance to. A<br />4) making out- another EXTREMELY catchy song should be a single; actually they all could be singles.  anyway, the song is great.<BR>A+<br />5) underneath it all- i think this song starts out at a Jamaican radio station, then it turns into &quot;underneath it all,&quot; then turns back to the radio station.  weird, but fun!  A<br />6) detective- one of my favs off this album, it could make a great video.  A+<br />7) don't let me down- this and &quot;platinum blonde life&quot; stole the melody from some 90's rock song, but the melodies were so good, and the lyrics so fresh, that you don't care!  my fav.  A+<br />8) start the fire- okay, this song starts out VERY strange, but turns into an electronic/reggae mix of rock.  A<br />9) running- long, draggy... B-<br />10) in my head- my 2nd fave.  somewhat original, and great to sing along to.  ends horribly! A+ though.<br />11) platinum blonde life- this song is pretty good, but it sounds too much like a green day or barenaked ladies song. A<br />12) waiting room- if the ending wasn't that okay, then this would have failed my grading scheme.  C-<br />13) rock steady- the traditional no doubt, 5 1/2 minute long song!  this song is VERY take-your-time.  A<br />overall, no doubt has made a (i wouldn't say different...) new album with great music and EXTREMELY catchy choruses and verses from Gwen.
B00000K19E|5.0|Everyone who enjoys eating take out Chinese food will love this awesome retelling of every Kirosawa movie ever made.  My all-time faveorite scene is the one with the guy who took the blue pill, but was color-blind by staring into the sun too long.<br />Definitely NOT a spoiler review.
B0000024TT|5.0|Leonard Cohen is great - and this is a great album.  But he's not for everyone.  By any objective standard his voice is not so hot.  However it's perfect for the thoughtful, emotive lyrics he writes.  If you're not in to thoughtful, emotive lyrics then Cohen is not for you.  If you are you will love this man and his work.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This is the be all and end of all digitally enhanced movies.  Send the kids to the mall to watch _Jimmy Neutron_ if you want a grown-up fairy tale for the rest of us struggling writers.<br />This video selection warmes my heart every time I play it.  After all, every one's a winner, am I right?
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This animation is in the realm of the surreal... it was done extremely well, in the sense that it was balanced between realism and a sense of cartoonish animation that make it light hearted and more relaxed.  It's a movie for a wide range of audiences.  Many of the jokes adults would find very funny.  It has appearances from many of the traditional children's stories.  The DVD it self is packed full of features, making it a great deal.  I find the ReVoice Studio feature very entertaining.  I spend hours putting my friend and my voices into the movie clips and playing it back in my computer with DVD quality.  The lip sync is easily done with software, making it look very professional.
B00003CXXS|4.0|compared to the other jurassic park movies this one lacks well pretty much a little of everything.  the whole point of the movie was to find that annoying as hell kid on the island and running away from the giant ass spinosaurus or whatever.  i still thought the movie was kinda cool with different dinosaurs but mostly the spinosaurus got kinda old.
B00005K3O4|5.0|&quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space.&quot;  Need I say more?  This is a fun, tongue-in-cheek horror/comedy.  There aren't any overt jokes, but the humor is situational.  A cult classic that is a lot of fun.  <br />On to the DVD.<br />MGM went all out for this one!<br />There are 5 featurettes:<br />-The Making of the Film<BR>-Behind the Scenes/On the Set<BR>-Komposing The Score<BR>-Visual Effects<BR>-Chiodo Brothers' Earliest Films<br />2 deleted scenes with optional commentary<BR>Bloopers (Not that funny really)<br />Storyboard Gallery (somewhat extensive, but you can't click on an individual storyboard for a closer look)<BR>Extensive galleries with conceptual art, some poster art.<br />Finally, the commentary with Stephen, Edward, and Charles Chiodo is very informative.  <br />At this price, it is a steal!
B00005A1VG|5.0|This has been one of my all time favorite movies for years and it simply has never been outdone before or since. This movie, more than any other version, captures the flavor ot the Robin Hood legend. Has there ever been an actor who captures Robin's saucy good humor like Errol Flynn? Could any other actress match Olivia DeHavilland's sweet but smart Marian? Has there ever been such a slinking, swashbuckling villain like Basil Rathbone. Warner Bros. knew a good thing when they saw it which is why this is one of several Flynn/deHavilland/Rathbone teamings starting with Captain Blood.<br />Like most other movie versions, Robin is portrayed as a nobleman turned bandit to fight injustice rather than the peasant boy framed for poaching. Also, like most versions, this movie borrows heavily from Sir Walter Scott's medieval epic Ivanhoe. The Norman/Saxon conflict is lifted directly from there as is much of Prince John's plotting. The two themes, however, are melded rather seamlessly.<br />Most delightful is the fact that unlike the other two famous versions of Robin Hood (the 1922 version and Prince of Thieves) this movie shows how most of the main merry men (say that 3 times fast!) were recruited. Not only are we shown the battle with Little John but also the rescue of Mudge the Miller's Son and the tricking of Friar Tuck. Flynn/Robin is a very good loser and this is maybe the most likable trait of his character.<br />The dialogue fits in perfectly, over the top yet believable when spoken by the talented cast.<BR>&quot;Why, you speak treason!&quot;<BR>&quot;Fluently&quot;<br />My only complaint is no DVD! If ever a movie deserved one this is it! The technicolor would be spectacular, the music gallant, and of course, I want to see some DVD goodies! I hope we will get one soon.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie was so brilliant! Normally movies based upon books don't live up to what people expect, but this film went beyond. At first I thought it would be stupid because Brad Pitt was in it, but he actually wasn't that bad. I also like the fact that David Fincher directed this movie, he did a very good job in fooling the entire audience, much like he did for the film Se7en and The Game. Fincher will probably never top this film in the rest of his career, this is his masterpiece. Meatloaf also has a role in the film and luckily he doesn't sing, his character is actually very amusing. Now I know I'm disobeying the first and second rules of Fight Club by writing this review, but it's just that good that I am willing to risk everything on this film.
0385505833|4.0|This Christmas book is relatively short (+170 pages) and is easy to read. It took me a little more than two hours to finish the novel. It was an enjoyable read. However, other than the fact that I learned there are people who spend thousands of dollars at Christmas time, I didn't learn anything from the book. Nor did it move me in any serious way. I found several parts to be quite hilarious (it is a satire after all), but laughter was the only emotion I felt./The story revolves around Luther and Nora Krank (anyone catch the symbolic last name). The book opens on the Sunday after Thanksgiving as Luther and Nora send their one and only child, their daughter Blair, off to Peru to begin a term of service with the Peace Corp. As the Kranks leave the airport and make a few trips on the way home (which causes much tension between the couple), Luther gets the brilliant idea of &quot;skipping Christmas&quot;, taking a cruise, and still saving thousands of dollars. Luther's plan goes off without too many problems. But then, something happens to turn his perfect idea into shambles./Grisham's novel seems to contain a lot of fluff. However, to assume the book is nothing but fluff, is a misunderstanding. SKIPPING CHRISTMAS is a satire largely lampooning the Christmas season in middle-class America. Some have suggested the book is racist because of certain comments. This is not true; racism is just one of the many societal ills satirized in this novel. The book is written in such a way that the ideas and attitudes being lampooned, could be disregarded because of the simple way in which the story is told./Overall, an entertaining novel that won't take much time to read but will make you laugh.
0385505833|5.0|This book is, as it says somewhere on the cover, &quot;a modern holiday classic&quot;.  It is about a couple whose daughter leaves to join the Peace Corps and help people less fortunate.  Her parents decide that since she isn't going to be home with them, they will skip the hassle of Christmas all together (no lights, no tree, no cards, not a single thing) and go on a ten day cruise.  Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your point of view) things do not work out at all as planned.<br />  This book is very short and sweet.  I read in one sitting while sitting in my favorite chair under an afghan (it's cold here in Cleveland!) on Christmas Eve.  It not only entertained me and made me laugh, but it also put me in the mood for the holidays.  I will, without a doubt be re-reading this book many Christmas Eves to come.  It has become a part of my holiday ritual and I'm sure you will feel the same once you read it.<br />  (By the way, Grisham is coming out with another book called The Summons this coming February.  It is a regular length Grisham book unlike this one, and from the title, I'm guessing it has lawyers in it which means Grisham is returning to his original genre.  Two books in one year!  What luck for us Grisham fans!)

0380973650|3.0|Not sure what it was, but it was a hard book to get through.  I did not hate it, as such, but fealt uneasy and strained while reading..  Not a bad ending overall..  I just can't put my finger on what I didn't like about it..  Besides being long..
B000002AGM|5.0|In order to appreciate a piano concerto or a symphony, you must listen to it in its entirety.  Each movement, although a complete piece in itself, is tied to the next and to the one before it.  Together, they paint a musical picture of what the master had in mind.<br />Such listening approach rarely, if ever, applies to modern music. Album selections are usually not related to each other and vary only in tempo and mood.  &quot;MILES AHEAD&quot; is one exception.  Arranger Gil Evans has cleverly woven ten disparate tunes together so that to the appreciative listener, the entire album plays like a suite.  Although the pieces were written by different composers and songwriters, they sound as if they were individual movements of a complete work.  Each track segues seamlessly into another.<br />&quot;My Ship,&quot; for instance, has a coda that leads quietly into the title track.  This  Kurt Weill-Ira Gershwin gem features the pure, sweet singing tone of Miles Davis's flugelhorn.  This is the most beautiful interpretation that I've ever heard.<br />&quot;Miles Ahead&quot; is one exquisite album. To understand and appreciate it completely, one should listen to it in its entirety .  So, sit back and enjoy this magnificently interwoven album in all its glorious, remastered stereophonic sound.

B000002NBY|5.0|Here we get Paul simon with his 'Simon &amp; Garfunkel' touch mixed with wonderful African beats and rhythm. I was looking for this album in India for a long lomg time. I love the music Paul Simon created with Art Garfunkel and I do have all their albums. The music in Graceland is even more brilliant.<br />I like to listen to world music. I think the arrangements are very different from the usual Rock and pop stuff we generally listen to. I won't go into discussions of which songs are good. I have to write all 11 songs are good. The last track (with Los Lobos) is great. One of the best album of all time and buy it to believe the sheer quality of music presented here.<br />Thanks Paul, I respect you a lot.

B00004STPT|5.0|After seeing the movie, I did not have any intendtion to buy the soundtrack until I watch the special features on the movie DVD.<br />In special features DVD, the last selection of the deleted scene had the track 'Now we are free' that led me to by the music CD.<br />I guess most of the credit goes to the voice of Lisa Gerrard. It's haunting, sad, and relaxing that made me to go out and get the 'More music from Gladitor' CD.<br />An action movie fan like myself had got sick of Hans Zimmer style of music. I remember clearly back at the cinema, I knew instantly that it was Hans work (credits was not shown till the end). It came from the scene when Maximas felt the danger of his wife &amp; son and rushes home on his horse. The music had the same patten to what Hans had use in 'The Rock' and 'Broken Arrow'.<br />However, that is the only noticable music, where rest of the other tracs on the CD were as impressive as James Horner work on Braveheart (which I also got).<br />Hans had previously worked with director Ridley Scott in Black Rain starring Michael Douglas.
B00005QIPH|4.0|When the album we all know Nevermind by Nirvana surpassed Michale Jackson to be #1 on the charts, punk and alternative fell dead where it stood. Good bands just stopped forming, there were stupid attmepts to be alterntaive bands (Creed, Silverchair, Dishwalla, ect) but as we all know they failed... miserably is an understatement. Some good punk/alternative bands lived on but no one new and good was forming. Punk died. Until a band we all know as At the Drive In formed, a Fugazi like hardcore/post punk band showed that their might be some hope in this puddle of Nu Metal BS. And now.. The Strokes! a  kind of pre-punk stooges like band is a twitch of a leg for alternative rock, the band is great their songs their attitude their style everything is perfect they are a great band but... Theres something missing, like ATDI they have potential and they really are good but they came to late, punk and alternative dead and i dont know if it come back, well see what happens in the wake of The Strokes seeing as ATDI broke up. If these bands had only formed pre-1991 they would be ledgends but theres just so much missing now... well we all loved you punk rock R.I.P 1975-1991
B000059XY3|3.0|Batman Forever is a good film. Not a great. Unlike Batman and Robin, you can sit through it and not get bored! Val kilmer plays Bruce Wayne pretty good. But his Wayne is pretty restrained. Kilmer's Batman is close, but no cigar. Chris O'donnell is pretty good a Robin, htough his Dick Grayson is pathetic at times. The villans are pretty weak, not evil like Nicolson's Joker. Jones hames up his role a bit too much fr me to take, but he isen't the center of the film. If he was, I'd probably give this movie two stars. Carrey is just MARVELOUS as the Riddler! He dosen't have to be very evil(has the Riddler ever been very evil?), so it's easy for Carrey to portray the Riddler. Carrey's only fault is that he hams his part up a bit. Good directing by newcomer Shulmaker(far better than Batman and Robin!). This guy had good iedas. Overall, a good movie, and perhaps the only Batman movie that the family can watch together(well, maybe Batman and Robin, too) Overall,a good movie!
B00005QZ7U|1.0|WITHOUT A DOUBT THIS HAS TO ONE OF THE WORSE MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN.IT REMINDS ME OF ONE OF THE ITALIAN ART FILMS OF THE 60&quot;S ,  FULL OF &quot;SOUND AND FURY&quot; SIGNIFYING NOTHING.  IT WAS A MISH MASH OF PRETENTIOUS AND SOPHOMORIC B.S.EVIDENTLY IT WAS NOT WRITTEN BUT WAS IMPROVISED BY FOLKS WHO WERE NOT GOOD AT IT.NICOLE KIDMAN CAN NOT ACT....PERHAPS THAT WAS WHY CRUISE DIVORCED HER.  SHE IS NOT A SEX-KITTEN BUT A TALENTLESS MULE. I DID LEARN SOMETHING FROM THIS PIECE OF TRASH...AND THAT IS TO NEVER BUY A DVD SIGHT UNSEEN  BY THE WAY THERE ARE TWO DISCS IN THIS RETCHED THING.

B00005QW5X|5.0|Mitchell's movie pioneers a new cultural and artistic aesthetic. From her costumes to her music to her gender, Hedwig shatters traditional concepts of art, music, and sexuality.  Indeed, to deny this film and the perspective it represents is to doom oneself to antiquted, parochial retrospection.
6300218031|5.0|I consider this movie the pinnacle of John Hugh's career.  The movie is a classic love triangle similar to Hugh's previous Pretty in Pink.  It sets up the protagonist Keith (Eric Stoltz) as the misunderstood artist in the 80's high school with his tomboy best friend Wutts (the ever endearing Mary Stuart Masterson.) Keith obsessed with the beauty of Miss Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson),feels inadequate because of his social status e.g. lives \\"across the tracks\\" very similar to that of Molly Ringwald's Character in Pretty in Pink.  The climax of the movie is Stolz's character taking Amanda Jones out on the perfect date culminating in a faux fight with the antagonist \\"richy\\" Hardy Genns.  Keith about to be pummelled by Genn's henchmen is saved \\"Deus ex Machina\\" by his \\"noble savage\\" friend Duncan whom he befriends in detention.  The movie ends with Keith's realization of his love for his best friend Wutts as they wind up kissing in the rain walking into the moonlight with the timeless line \\"You look good wearing my future.\\"  So although the movie is quite sappy and somewhat predictable, it is still a triumph of the underdog which must always be celebrated.  It has a kick [butt] soundtrack, but however does not include Billy Idol's \\"Catch my Fall\\" and Charlie Sexton's \\"Beat So Lonely\\" which are key songs in the movie.  It is 80's adolescent romance at it's best.
B000002KHH|5.0|This album sets the standard for heavvy metal albums that never miss a beat.  There is not a single weak track on this album from the godfathers of metal.  Eight killer tracks, from the legendary ballad War Pigs all the way to Fairies Wear Boots, &quot;Paranoid&quot; never lets you leave.  It dares you to turn up the volume.  Black Sabbath's monster hit that skyrocketed them to the top in the USA is a must own for hard rock fans and heavy metal fans.  &quot;Now in darkness the world stops turning, ashes where the bodies were burning.&quot;
B000002VQQ|5.0|Originally better known as a beat-style poet of the New York avant guard, in the 1970s Smith began to offer public readings with music--and quickly developed into an iconoclastic artist of remarkable intensity.  HORSES, a collection that slaps the listener from explosive ferocity to lotus-like lyricism and then back again, is her debut album.<br />This is not your grandmother's rock and roll.  Smith opens HORSES with a hard-rocking and revamped version of the old standard &quot;Gloria&quot;--and reinterprets the piece into a determined, deliberate, and defiant bit of blasphemy calculated to snap even a non-believer's head back.  The shock of &quot;Gloria&quot; sets the tone for the rest of the album: no boundries tolerated.  And Smith and her band actually manage to follow through, with pieces that encompass subjects ranging from dreams of aliens to homosexual rape to suicide.  Smith's voice can be quite melodic, but for HORSES she emphasises vocal authority, growling, dragging, and sometimes even throwing away all tonal quality entirely.<br />HORSES is rather loosely structured, and some of the tracks work better than others--but even by today's standards the album retains its cutting edge.  And its an edge Smith knows how to use.  The album is an essential, but brace yourself: it is a demanding ride.
B00005QDW5|5.0|&quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, &quot;The Wall&quot;, and &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; are just some of the albums with masterpiece songs and compositions included in this collection of Floyd's best.  A perfect balance of Gilmour's guitar, Water's lyrics, and Barret's mind - Echoes holds songs not just to be remembered by Floyd fans but to be remembered as some of the best music of all time.  Made with rememberance to all members of Pink Floyd (ex-ones and ones to date).
B00000DHR0|5.0|This is the best Christmas CD of Celine. I love it so much!!!! It would be a perfect holiday gift for anyone who enjoys Celine's gifted voice.<br />My favorite tracks are, &quot;Another year has gone by&quot; , &quot;The magic of christmas day&quot; ,and &quot;These Are the special times&quot;<br />Wonderful Music Celine!
B00000064E|4.0|A very pleasant album, immaculately produced, perhaps a masterpiece of British folk. The songs are nice and pleasing, very pleasant to listen to: relaxing. Drake's delicate acoustic guitar work is fine and suits the songs perfectly, augmented by fine string and wind arrangements (though they can be slightly overbearing at times), and bright splashes of piano. Drake's own lyrics are beautiful examples of understated emotional poetry. His vocals are distinctive, very English, and a good medium for communicating this poetry, especially with this musical backing. It's a nice package. Certainly a hallmark recording for anyone interested in British folk.
0452282152|4.0|Written in a soft and subtle style, at the same time with a richness a acuity that showed me into the world of Delft in Vermeer's time.  I felt like I could see the painting from the inside out.  The writer's style was congruent with the feeling of Vermeer's art.

B000002HD5|5.0|This is perhaps one of the most overlooked albums ever.  Gentleman is a &quot;gut-wrenching&quot; tale from Greg Dulli that every man can sympathise with and makes me wonder if there can be any female fans of this band.<br />Quite simply the lyrics come from a deep dark place inside Dulli and it shows and the band is so tight it could kick down a door and still keep on playing.  <br />If you do not have this album, buy it immediately!  But you have been warned.  How would I describe these guys...<br />The grit of James Brown and Curtis Mayfield (without the funk), the lyrics of Jim Morrison (maybe without the poetry but all the alcohol), maybe not even the lyrics of Jim Morrsion, the showmanship of Elvis Presley (with the hip gyrations), the raw and raunch of Prince (without the soul), aw..its just Greg Dulli at his best.  Trust me.
6301442962|5.0|&quot;Miracle On 34th Street&quot; is 20th Century-Fox's 1947 Christmas carol.  Much to the surprise of virtually everybody who was involved in that picture, however, it endures today as a parable of faith, of &quot;believing when 'common-sense' tells you you shouldn't.&quot;<br />The question of &quot;Is there a Santa Claus?&quot; is dispensed with in the opening footage of this film (Edmund Gwenn, in a totally-deserved Oscar performance, handles that issue very nicely); &quot;Miracle&quot; concerns itself, rather, with the question of Santa's 'nature,' who he truly is as well as how he operates.<br />&quot;Miracle's&quot; plot is more than slightly complex: it addresses issues beyond the simple question of faith vs. rationale (which it handles, by the way, more than adequately); it likewise turns upon a postwar issue of psychology -- both in Doris Walker's (Maureen O'Hara) Spock-inspired approach to child-rearing, as well as Granville Sawyer's (Porter Hall) 'pop-psyche' analysis of various individuals, which leads to the film's ultimate crisis point -- while also grounding itself in the reality-based world of New York City politics (catch William Frawley's pre-&quot;I Love Lucy&quot; turn as a political fixer as he guides Gene Lockhart's Judge Harper through the court hearings).  There are also some snide, laughing-up-one's-sleeve, references to certain &quot;only slightly-crazy persons . . .  such as artists, composers, and some persons in Washington,&quot; which help to give this film a sense of verisimilitude.<br />Such is the balance which this film achieves -- augmented by the location footage inside Macy's Manhattan store, the 1946 Thanksgiving parade, and various scenes around Manhattan courthouses -- that makes it work.  Much against your will, possibly, you may find yourself beginning to believe in all sorts of wondrous things.<br />And if that's not a bona fide miracle . . .  then it's up to you to tell me what is!
B000002BHE|5.0|Since I am a HUGE Celine fan ,I already almost have all of her English-language CDs(Plus a few french ones) and Falling Into You is one the best albums that Celine Dion has released in this decade! But some songs were left out of the U.S. versions that aren't on the U.S. versions like.. &quot;Your Light&quot; , &quot;You Make Me Feel (Like A Natural Woman&quot; and To Love You More (Which is on the U.S. versions of Let's Talk About Love &amp; which is on the Japanese versions of Falling into You) So there are 16 tracks in all. And also there are 3 English songs on this album that are in French on the CD called The French Album (or D'Eux) and they are, If that's what it takes &quot;pour que tu m'aimes encore&quot;, i dont know &quot;je sais pas&quot; , fly &quot;vole!&quot; I like the french versions better and I'm sure everyone else who is a Celine fan ,does too. Anways buy this Falling Into You CD if you don't have it! It's worth every penny, trust me. Don't listen to those people who say not to buy this album!!!!! JUST BUY IT:-). I hope this review was helpful for those of you who don't have the CD!<br />My favorite tracks are, &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; , &quot;Falling Into You&quot; , and &quot;It's All Coming Back To Me Now&quot; <br />Bravo Celine:)
0060934719|2.0|Neil Gaiman is a wonderful writer and when I picked up Stardust and read the first few pages I was prepared to be enchanted. Unfortunately, the spell never quite took. There is so much to like about Stardust - the basic premise, the main characters, the descriptions both of the human town of Wall and the faery land of Faery. But for all its plots and subplots the story has no depth. It's like only being able to dip your toe into the pool on a hot day when you really want to dive in. As another reviewer here points out, everytime we appear to reach a crisis Gaiman gives the character an &quot;easy out&quot; and there's never any real denouement. Stars may be able to survive without substance, good stories can't.
B00003CX8I|4.0|We can accept others as one or not.  Race relations taken to a new depth via mutants vs humans just as it was in black vs white in the US and South Africa.  Do we choose to live together as one or to fight to destroy the other.  We must choose.  The X-Men chose to live with us and help us.  This film was also a very entertaining movie as I grew up with the X-Men comic books. It has mild violence but is a good movie for the average teen and adult.  Definately in my keep files.
B00005QIPH|3.0|I am probably the only person who loves the Velvet Underground and Television that is going to say this, but I must.<br />I bought the album based upon the buzz and was looking forward to something special.  It is a good album, but by no means IS THIS IT.  This album is repetitive, the production quality fuzzes out the lead singer to the point of obscurity, but the band is tight and the guitar hooks are very interesting.<br />The Strokes are an up and coming item and I look forward to hearing more from them but by no means are they Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground aside from being art rockers from NYU and NYC. <br />Feel free to form your own opinions though.
1881273156|5.0|This is an excellent book, not only for couples but for developing responsible individual ways of communication with all people. Easily read &amp; understood, Gary writes in a way to develop skills we already have but often do not use.<br />Once I was able to recognize the language that speaks &quot;love to me&quot; it was easier to express my wants &amp; needs to the man in my life. It is a tool to develop self-love &amp; understanding, vital in ourself first before we are able to &quot;teach&quot; what we need to another.<br />Excellent, also for helping to understand conflicts with siblings and children. Each time I've read it, I have discovered a perspective I did not have before. Excellent book.
B00000D9TK|5.0|This french CD (S'il Suffisait D'Aimer) is a cool french CD by Celine. I love it!!!! Please buy this CD if you don't already have it,k?:)<br />My favorite tracks are, &quot;L'Abandon&quot; , &quot;On Ne Change Pas&quot; ,and &quot;Zora Sourit&quot;<br />Cool French CD Celine:-))
B000002J03|5.0|I'm a child of today. But I wish I was a child of yesterday. Yesterday's bands were better, music was real and rock ruled (today's bands do it for money (okay not ALL), music is commercialized and we have boybands, yack). But children of today have one good thing: we get good old albums remastered!<BR>Led Zeppelin II was the first Zep album to me and I loved it immediately. The musical experience starts with Whole Lotta Love, which is incredible. The guitar riff is gorgeus and the more quiet parts make the more loud parts come out better...and the one part, you-know-what-I-mean -part just blows your mind. Lyrics are pretty simple but very suggestive (talking about giving a whole lotta love by giving you every inch of his love, well as a woman I just keep listening to this song again and again). What Is And What Should Never Be is one of the best songs in the album. The Lemon Song is quite bluesy with some unforgettable lyrics (&quot;the way you squeeze my lemon/ till the juice runs down my leg&quot;) well well well... Thank You is from another galaxy; its beautiful and idyllic with peaceful sounds.<BR>Heartbreaker reminds me a little bit of Whole Lotta Love, and in a good way. And from Heartbreaker we move smoothly to Living Loving Maid (Shes Just A Woman) which is a basic good rock song. Ramble On continues the same way and I have to confess that I love to sing along this song (I'm not too sure if my neighbors like it, though...). Moby Dick's the one with the fabulous (forgive these worn-out superlatives I use) drum solo...and also it made me think that is the name REALLY so dirty or is it just me? I first thought about the famous book but then I went on thinking about something else... maybe it's the influence of this album =).<BR>Bring It On Home is a beautiful bluesy end for this diverse record...it also reminds me of Belly Button Window by Jimi Hendrix (which is a great song, Jimi rocks YEAH!). This album is very bluesy; I wouldn't call this a heavy metal album but a rock album with whole lotta blues. And, of course, the love.
0793518326|5.0|All I have to say is kudos to the four transcriptionists. They have done something which most of us would not have the patience to do: sit down, listen and transcribe every instrument on every commercially released Beatles track from &quot;Love Me Do&quot; to &quot;Her Majesty&quot;. It's just a pity this published before the &quot;Beatles Anthology&quot;--it would have been nice to have &quot;Free As A Bird&quot; and &quot;Real Love&quot; written out. I guess I just wish there were more compilations like this one. I've learned some really valuable things from this book. With the help of my music theory teacher (who also owns a copy) I've learned to read drum scores. I also am so pleased that I finally have Paul McCartney's bass lines tabbed out. In my opinion Paul can't be beat for straight forward pop/rock bass playing that keep things grooving. The stuff from RUBBER SOUL and ABBEY ROAD are the best.
6301969588|4.0|I was astounded yet thankful that such a group of people struggling together to survive had the courage to create this movie.Having individually been the social scurge and outcast, they find a common place and then turn it around so the very people who forsook them now has to pay to see them. I applaud the cast and all others who assisted in the production of this film. Their simple humility could not be hidden. Their dignity was plainly shown for all to see. The purity of their spirit is anything but freakish yet the one they turned into a freak was given a body that matched her freakish spirit. It makes one think, &quot;Who really are the the freaks in this world?&quot; I hope they laughed their way to the bank for a job well done...the joke is on us, &quot;the normals?&quot; I do so applaud them all.
B000002OVJ|5.0|The original six-cut album was a jewel in its own right in 1970, but this does, indeed, prompt the question as to why they didn't just put it onto a double-set and keep all this music in one place in the first place? Well, better late than never seems to apply especially so here. And while it isn't quite as cohesive as the pleasant surprise of their 1970 Isle of Wight performance appearing on disc a few years back, the filled-out &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; is its own best advertisement. In some places it beats the Wight set; this performance of &quot;Amazing Journey/Sparks&quot; is a little more bristlingly lyrical than the Wight set, and this version of &quot;Heaven and Hell,&quot; likewise leading off the set, is even more thrusting (and John Entwistle's vocal better miked), even if you would almost like to wrap Peter Townshend's solo from the Wight version onto this version.<br />But why quibble? Especially when there's a shimmering performance of &quot;Tattoo&quot; (one of the signature songs from the badly underrated &quot;The Who Sell Out,&quot; and proof squared that Roger Daltrey had at last come into his own as one of the singular rock singers of his day), a pounding remake of &quot;I'm A Boy,&quot; a rip-roaring, boisterous &quot;A Quick One, While He's Away,&quot; and, of course, the original six &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; jewels: &quot;Young Man Blues&quot; (though, admittedly, the same-era performance that turned up on &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; is the best version captured on disc), &quot;Substitute&quot; (ok, admit it: you've forgiven them for the unconscionably short version they do here), &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; (and what a treat it was to see this one sneak into the Top 40 as a surprise hit in 1970), &quot;Shakin' All Over&quot; (Peter Townshend's best guitar solo of the set is here), &quot;My Generation&quot; (why they billed it as merely &quot;My Generation&quot; remains a mystery - it segues into one hell of a &quot;Tommy&quot; instumental medley, with some very fancy musical footwork from Moon, Townshend, and Entwistle - but never mind), and &quot;Magic Bus&quot; (the absolute best concert capture of this gem in the Who's catalog).<br />This was the best hard rock concert group going between 1969-71. The new &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; joins the Isle of Wight set as the incontrovertible evidence.
B000002C4J|5.0|This is a Love CD, that's why the album is called \\"Let's Talk About Love\\"...everyone should know that by now! Anyways this CD is the best Love CD ,that Celine has released. The songs are great! Except there's one song that does not stand out to me and that is \\"I Hate you then I love you\\" I dont know why it doesn't stand out to me, it just doesnt. But this CD is terrific, go out and buy this CD if you dont have it! :)<br />My favorite tracks are, \\"Where is the love\\" , \\"Treat her like a lady\\" ,and \\"My heart will go on\\"<br />Best Love CD Celine:-)

B00005NWM3|5.0|I started listening to Nickelback when I heard Breathe on the radio.  I thought it was amazing and bought their other CD (which is self titled I believe).  I saw them in concert and they are a VERY fun live show to see.<br />Then I heard How You Remind Me on the radio and I was blown away.  It's my favorite song that they've done so far.  Soon as I heard it I went out and bought the Silver Side Up CD.  In the month or so that I've had it, I've listened to it almost non-stop.  Most of the songs are fantastic and they really get me moving.  I saw them in concert again recently (with Saliva and Default) and they rocked even more this time.  They performed mostly songs from Silver Side Up and it was great.  Definitely worth every cent I paid for the CD.
B00005OAA6|4.0|I have to say I am impressed with this girl.  She does not seem at all like &quot;Posh spice&quot; whom I always thought looked the same in every picture she took and always underwelmed the crowd with her vocals....But She really proves her strong contribution to the spice girls with image shattering lyrics and thought provoking music production.  <BR>   I am glad I bought this album.  At first I thought I would end up calling this album the posh spice LP and only recommend that it get played at the perfume counters at the mall but NO!! OH NO!<br />  Every Spice fan needs to get a load of 'Not such an innocent girl'.  Its like 'If you wanna have some fun' off of forever mixed in with 'Wannabe' off of Spice.  <BR>  'A mind of its own'  almost seems like something Mel C and V would have wrote together.  <BR>  Now, the whole album is good but I have to point out I.O.U. is such a beautiful song.  It rivals 'Time goes by' off of their forever album.  and I think 'Time goes by' is the best love song the spice girls ever wrote.  <BR>  Also 'Watcha talkin bout'  seems like a reaction against The Backstreets boys &quot;the call&quot;<BR>  'Every part of me' is sweet.<br />I have to call attention to the huge picture of her thats inside the cd in the pullout.............Its worth the price of the album alone!
B000053ZRQ|2.0|i'm a huge bon jovi fan but didn't enjoy this video <BR>that much. the video's quality wasn't that good, and <BR>the band's performance wasn't that good either. <BR>it was just boring. i've only watched this once since <BR>i bought it. live from london is much more better.
B00005A46T|1.0|Slipknot is just another marketing ploy from the once revered label, RoadRunner Records, that has since gone down the toilet.  I can see the greedy executives right now licking their lips to the thought of money rolling in because of this bands' Generation X agenda (ie: all image, no musical ability/innovation whatsoever).  Fortunately this awful fad actually appears to be fading a bit.  It's so difficult to write a review when there is no material to review.  The guitarists just continue to hammer the same chords throughout the entirety and the song structures remind of every other mainstream Metal (I use the term loosely) band that has been on RR.  At least four of the members of the band are gratuitous and it just proves the futile argument that these guys are in any way rebellious to be completely false.  Then there's the jumpsuit gimmick coming from a band that appears to be anti-capital, anti-establishment, while selling jumpsuits on the market to suburban drones for $100.  Quite a hypocrisy!  Jeez Carl man.  You're too underground for me *sarcasm*.  But seriously, why, oh why would any listener of Spiral Architect, Arcturus, Suffocation, Katatonia, and Anathema waste their time with this wretched pile of dung?  And the lyrics are downright repugnant!  The antithesis of poetry:  Completely tripe and brain-dead.  The limited vocabulary pseudo angst thing is just so absurd and contains absolutely no ingenuity.  Anyone with a love of any kind of music (excluding rap, pop, and essentially all nu-metal, whatever that's supposed to mean), I would suggest to disregard this band.  And please pay no attention to that Denver Broncos review that reeks of ignorance.  That's just insulting all Hardcore and Metal bands out there that bust their butts without compromise and can write a song that actually contains passion and conviction.  If you wear visors, baggy pants, think piercings are 'cool', and think you're tortured due to lack of attention, then by all means follow the herd and dive into this deplorable act.  Prepackaged, derivative, and mass-produced for anyone too lazy to explore the capabilities of true music.  A safe buy for fans of &quot;angst-ridden&quot; pop, synonymous with bubblegum pop that most Slipknot lovers inexplicably loathe.  There's nothing more to say or else I'd be wasting my own time, except avoid this at all costs.
B00004Z4WR|4.0|Basic storyline:  Little Kip (Ribisi) botches a 50-car boost and his big brother Memphis (Cage) comes to the rescue.  They steal a bunch of really nice cars, including a 67 Shelby GT at the end.<br />If you can suspend reality a bit, the movie is fun.  It's tough to watch with my boyfriend because he is always pointing out how unrealistic everything is.  I saw the movie for what it is:  Pure fun.  It's not an Oscar type movie that is supposed to provoke deep thoughts.<br />My problems with it - 1) Angelina Jolie was not in it enough.  2) I'm not a fan of Ribisi and his character seemed like a whiny little baby the entire movie.  3) I had to make myself ignore the zillions of unrealistic things that happened (ie:  the helicopter flying 15 feet off the ground chasing the Shelby GT).<br />Basically it's a fun flick to watch if you like pretty cars, but people who are very analytical about movies will probably hate it.
B00005LKIM|5.0|When Hannibal first came into theatres, I was hearing horrible comments about the film from nearly everyone I know who saw it.  So I decided to wait to see the film until it came out for home rental.  After having watched it, however, I do not understand why I heard so many negative comments about this movie!  I was absolutely taken by the detailed cinematography.  The look and feel of the film and soundtrack definitely has and arthouse-like quality to it.  Anthony Hopkins once again took my breath away with his manipulative, dominating and psychotic yet somehow seductive performance of the Hannibal Lecter role.  I felt that Julianne Moore did very well with performing the more experienced FBI agent Starling.  The one thing that my heart burned throughout the film for was more interaction between Clarice and Hannibal.  Their interaction in the latter part of the film was so haunting and it left me hungry for more.  Many people were aggrevated by this lack of interaction, but I do have to point out that the way in which Lecter haunts agent Starling in the earlier portion of the film definitely builds a hunger for the interaction that does come later in the film to satify the desire to see Clarice and Hannibal together.  <br />If this is your first time seeing the film, I do definitely recommend it.  It's very different from Silence of the Lambs, but I wouldn't go so far to say that it is worse.  I think that if you see the movie expecting to see more of Silence then you will definitely be disappointed.  Try to watch it with your mind a clean slate.  And if you haven't seen Silence of the Lambs, here's an idea.  Watch Hannibal first, then watch Silence.  I think that would be the most complementary way to watch both films.<br />Oh yeah, and it's really not that gorey.  I've seen the same stuff on E.R.  Minus the man eating boars...
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge (I have the Special Edition released in Australia on Dec 5, 2001) is one of the most superbly presented DVD/Videos I have ever seen. In Stictly Ballroom Director Luhrmann used Dance to tell his story, in Romeo and Juliet he used Language and now in Moulin Rouge he uses song. Featuring versions of Lady Marmalade, Your Song, Children of the Revolution as well as Roxanne (Police) which is a rough/gutsy tango version you have to hear to truly appreciate. You enter a world where the dialogue and the song become one, which then combine with costumes, colour and specatcle to create a unique and original landmark production. This is not your normal film - this film has opened new doors. This is especially a film for lovers of Music Theatre and Dance and I understand auditions are currently underway for the Stage Production of Moulin Rouge.   Special features include documentaries, interviews, narration for the visually impaired and you can do your own live vision mixing with multi angle scenes with the three most elaborate dance sequences - the Can-Can, Tango and Coup d'Etat. Obviously the best place to view this film is on the big screen which gives the feel of being in a theatre, but this is a great compromise and the more you watch it the more you recieve from it.  Value for money - yes yes yes.
1891252089|5.0|This book is incredible.  What separates this book from every other yoga manual on the market is twofold.  First, every pose that Swenson presents comes with two or three variations.  This consideration allows one to custom tailor the practice to their abilities.  Second, Swenson doesn't seem to suffer from the self-importance that other authors do.  There are no long winded explanations on how yoga has changed his life, or how enlightened he feels.  It is really refreshing.
B00004Z459|5.0|Excellent record!  I love when I buy a CD and actually like every song on it.  After I heard &quot;In the End&quot; I went and bought Hybrid Theory.  I started on track 1 and loved the entire CD.  &quot;One Step Closer&quot; is great, as well as &quot;Crawling.&quot;  &quot;Cure for the Itch&quot; is a great diversion from the rock/rap songs that make up the rest of the CD (it's a DJ mix done by one of the guys in the band).  My favorite song on the CD is &quot;Pushing Me AWay.&quot;  The lyrics are really moving.<br />My only qualm with the CD is the fact that it's so short.  I think the entire run time of the CD is something like 40 minutes.  Maybe it just seems short to me because I can't get enough of it.  ;)<br />I listen to this CD all the time in my car and can't wait to see Linkin Park live.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who is a Limp Bizkit fan and/or in to the rock/rap genre of music.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|From Baz Luhrman, director of Strictly Balroom and Romeo+Juliet, comes a redefiniton of the musical. A stunning pictorial fantasy that teaches it's audience 'the greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return.'<br />Both Ewin McGregor and Nicole Kidman give superb performances, both revealing suprising musical talent. Nicole is absolutely picturesque.<br />The cinematography is true Baz Luhrman. At points a little bit nauseating to watch, but even those scenes are essential to give the viewer a sense of the chaos that was the bohemian revolution.<br />About the only thing that I did not care for in this movie was John Liguizimo, who plays Tolouse La Trec. His accent and odd stature is a bit annoying, but is a point easily overlooked in this modern-day musical masterpiece
B0000541VS|5.0|We have to move from the obvious center of the story, a group of young kids who became adults in very difficult circumstances : those of Hell's Kitchen in New York, to the priest who is a permanent reference all along. He wants to bring those kids to some kind of salvation that could mean priesthood for some of them. He fails, and it is his being too lenient that causes the drama of their life : their imprisonment in a very special Boys' educational detention center. But two of the boys will turn criminal and kill one night one of the ex-wardens in whose hands they had suffered hell and blazes. The priest will save them from due punishment and his lie, in the name of the necessary correction of the evil performed in this detention center, will push the two young men into more crimes and a violent death. The dilemma of the priest between improving the world and saving the souls of young people is set wrong from the very start : souls can only be saved with love and strict rules set by God himself, not with permissiveness : the latter has a tendency to reproduce evil more than to correct it and hence to save souls.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
078581325X|5.0|I've read most to these adventures over 30 years ago when I was a young teenager. I enjoyed them immensely then.<br />  Now that I'm reading these stories again, the illustrations do enhance the stories greatly and adds more depth and understanding to the era in which these stories were written.<br />  Although these stories are dated, some having been written over a hundred years ago and from the technological advances in criminology today, the suspense and pace of these stories will keep you glued until you get to the end of the mystery.<br />  This book is well worth the expense and will be a fine addition to the collection of any Sherlock Holmes fan.
0385505833|1.0|Trying to offset the agony of a huge, pre-Christmas airport line, I purchased this book in an airport bookstore at full price. At over ten-cents a page, I was determined to savor every word of this book. Unfortunately, this short story of near magazine thickness was one dimensional, predictable, and flat-out disappointing. Worse yet, I finished it before reaching the ticket counter! I felt taken having purchased this book. John, if you care anymore and are reading these reviews, please do us all a favor and spend some time on your next one!
B00005BJMQ|5.0|In true Baz Lurhman style, the music from Moulin Rouge is quite possibly some of the best ever arranged (I say arranged because most of the songs are re-makes) From Lady Marmalade to Le Tango de Roxanne, this music is something to sing along to almost every day.
B00000K3CM|5.0|There aren't many movies where the sequel is better than the original, but this is an exception! HA2 is awesome!
B00003CXXS|1.0|This is without a doubt one of the worst films of the year even with the fine special effects.<BR>The acting is bad because the writing is bad because the direction is bad.  I would advise anyone not to spend a dime on this film and certainly not your valuable time.
6305907145|3.0|They say the great thing about Shakespeare's work is that it is so open to interpretation. Every director can bring his or her fresh eyes to a play and make it new. Even so, I think we are obliged to stay true to the basic tennents of the text. Are the works of Jane Austen as open to interpretation? Maybe, but I doubt it; Certainly not if MANSFIELD PARK is anything to go by.<br />MANSFIELD was always my favourite of Austen's six novels. Many modern critics, while not denying its basic greatness, have problems with the book. Many find FANNY PRICE unlikeable, many find her judgemental, and feel that her Stoic, Augustan approach is hard to relate to. Stand-by, do nothing, and eventually he'll see the error of his ways and come to love you. Not very modern, is it?<br />OK, so if you don't like the main character, if you don't like what she has to say, then what do you do? Look for other aspects of the story you can relate to. In recent years some critics have chosen to see MANSFIELD PARK in Post-Imperial terms, as a critique of Slavery. After all, the family's wealth is based on plantations in Antiga, which were run by slaves. Is that what the book's about? Is it? I don't know. I think the evidence is a little slim, but who am I to deny the possibility? Maybe it plays a part in the subtext of the novel.<br />So, I'm a modern script-writer who doesn't like the novel, it's pre-occupations or even Fanny Price. What do I do? I completely re-write the story to take a possible minor sub-text (slavery) and turn it in to the driving narrative force. I then take smart as a whippet, stubborn yet passive Fanny and turn her into a ballsy version of Bridget Jones. With an attitude. I then string together a couple of scenes from the book with a few invented bridging scenes to advance the romance. Et Voila! I have a completely different story!<br />I don't know what this film is, but it isn't Mansfield Park. Enjoy it on its own terms, but don't ever get the idea that your watching Austen on the screen. But, jeeze. I think that if you're going to adapt a novel for the screen, you ought to at least like the source material; Otherwise, what's the point? If you don't like the main character, you shouldn't be able to completely re-invent her. Or if you do, you should have the decency to be a little ashamed.
B00004XQP4|2.0|yeah ok so minority and warning are pretty good but the rest of the album isn't very good to be honest.i mean yeah its ok if you like that sort of thing but its not going to convert you or anything, save you money up and buyt something diffrent like brit rockers feeder, and their fourth album echo park.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|. . . when it's good, it's very very good, and when it's bad it's horrid.  There are parts of this film that are stunningly brilliant, and parts of this film that are laughable they are so bad.  I'll get the bad out of the way first so I can rave.  Some of the musical numbers (most notably &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; - give me a break) shouldn't have been in the finished film.  But that's my small gripe.  <br />I'll admit that I waited until this was released on video to see it, and I really really wish I'd seen it in the theater to be able to full experience its lavishness.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are both beautiful and brilliant, even their maligned signing.  Their acting is amazing, but when I heard them sing &quot;Come What May&quot; the first time, I had to run it back and hear it again.  I simply can't believe that some critics would criticize their singing.  The sets, the supporting characters (ranging from the almost unrecognizable John Leguizamo who must've had his legs amputated for this role, and the amazing man from Topsy Turvy), I was continually surprised and blown away by this movie.  <br />Congratulations to Baz Luhrman on a quite remarkable achievment.
B00005LOUQ|1.0|It sucks.  It sucks.  It sucks.  Took one of the greatest animated movies of all time, added meaningless psychobabble to a story that was supposed to tell us about the possibility for reform in all of us and tried to make us feel sorry for the grinch, thereby avoiding the principal idea - even the WORST person can become better.  HORRID film.  NO redeeming qualities at all.  Not worth sitting through.  Not worth watching.  If you buy it, burn it.  I can't believe I had to give this film a star at all.
B00003IPFK|5.0|Lonesome Dove is simply the best western every filmed. A realistic story of the frontier in epic proportions. You have all the makings here. A cattle drive, indians and bandits and the story gives you enough time to know the players and understand their actions and their philosophies. This movie is Robert Duvall's role of a lifetime as he brings to life the most colorful character ever to grace a western. I saw the mini-series, own the VHS boxed set and now own the DVD and will enjoy it for years to come. If you havnt seen it and are a fan of westerns, the price of the DVD is a steal considering what your money is getting for you.
B00005LOUQ|1.0|There are no redeeming qualities to this version.  The original is perfect, and this adaptation is a complete bastardization.  Horrid.  No good moments at all.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|If I could give this movie 6 stars then I would give it 7!!<BR> I NEVER thought I could love a movie as much as I love Moulin Rouge!! WOW, is that film AMAZING... It totally *Lift me up were I belong.* <BR>I saw it 3 times in the cinema, I own the soundtrack, and I'm SO gonna get the video and DVD(Actually I dont have a DVD *Player* but I'm a fan so whatever!!)<BR>WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!
B00004TH83|5.0|Lara Fabian is the greatest. No one compares to her and no one ever will. Her voice and writing is so incredible. If you listen to her you'll never go back to teeny boppers again.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|While Lady Marmalade was only used as a marketing ploy to lure viewers to see this movie, this movie is so much more.  Its a love story with tons of great music numbers and productions that will blow you away.  I myself am not a musicals fan- in fact, the only other one i can tolerate is my favorite movie of 2000, Dancer in the Dark.  This movie is so offbeat and so indie-like, i'm very confused on why it made so much.  Maybe mainstream America does have a little taste left.  This is definately the best movie of the year, and its a shame the academy will split their vote between the Others and this one. This role for Nicole is most definately more demanding and dynamic, and showcases her singing talent.  Someone get this woman a record deal! She can sing!  Especially when she sings &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away&quot;.  Its absolutely breathtaking.  Anyone who has a love for any movie, or what movies should be all about, check this movie out.  It is brilliantly directed by Baz Luhrman, and when he makes another movie i'll be the first in line to see it.  Just see this, even if it is just to say you saw it, because the whole movie is like an experience. 2 hours of pure bliss.  Best movie, along with Memento, to come out this year.
630528069X|5.0|I watched &quot;Moonlighting&quot; when I was younger, and then one day I saw a commercial for this movie. I was amazed that Bruce Willis would be cast in such a part. I didn't even think about seeing the movie, even though I love action films. Then one day, my brother spoke about this awesome movie he saw. To my suprise, he said it was &quot;Die Hard&quot;. At the time, I was under age to see this movie. So, I did what all under age kids do,,I bought tickets for &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot; and snuck into &quot;Die Hard&quot;. I loved this film, I still watch it on occasion. Every scene in this film was awesome. If I was marooned on a planet with only one movie to take, &quot;Die Hard&quot; would be the one.
B00000099Y|3.0|There are people who either hate, or love tool. I on the other hand stand right in the middle, I neither hate, nor love tool. I just look at em as a average rock band, or at other points a little abouve average. But I guess it depends on what aspect of tool your looking at, the music or the art work or art work revolving around tool. The music is indeed averge, with average musicitianship. The artwork itself it way abouve average, indeed tool are artists, but sometimes within a musical level that cannot always come to. The thing about this album is that in many parts it's quite hollow, with to much filler, and really only 6 good songs in my opioin. Those songs being stinkfist,H,euology(sp?),forty 6 & 2,jimmy and pushit. Although each of the songs can definelty hold there own and still manage to have a solid song structure. But then you get into songs like third eye and hooker with a penis that are well, dismal, mainly third eye where it is basicly 13 minutes of nothing, and some sound clips thrown in. One thing that get gets me off is how people can compare tool to pink floyd? blashpamy I say. When tool start producing albums that are as solid as a block of steel and making albums that are on the charts or 14 years at a time(dark side of the moon), then come see me. Also pink floyds musical ability exceeds tool to lengths that are simply unfathomable, and origanality? what tool have done has been done by led zepplin and black sabbath 25-30 years before this album.
6305910103|1.0|1. This print really requires a good digital video and audio cleanup.<br />2.

B00005IBGQ|4.0|I discovered Rufus Wainwright when I saw him open for Tori Amos. I thought he was one of the best opening acts I've seen - funny and great live and stripped jst him alone on the keyboard or guitar. After buying the albuim I think Rufus is an amazing song writer and this album is full of smart, melodic and earnest pop songs. One of my favorites is 'In A Graveyard' a song about how we all come back one day.

0792156684|2.0|Horrible. The only good part of DeCapprio's performance was his drowning scene near the end. The only other good part was the drawing scene which gives the movie a pair of stars, but that is it. Flush it down.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Some call it MTV Movie, others call it Masala Movie.  It certainly is very unusual, yet I don't remember enjoying watching movie as I did with this movie for sometime.  This is a pure entertainment filled with music and dance, eye-poping sets, costume and effects.  DVD makes it even better with throwing in an extra disc that contains not only behind the scene stuffs, but dance scenes and of course &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; in two versions, a music video and a performance from MTV Music Award.
B00005OM5L|5.0|This DVD is simply marvelous. The band is really tight and Clapton's playing is both tasteful and enticing. Aside from the superb playing, however, what I think I like best is the fact that they left all the little &quot;artifacts&quot; of the live performance intact. Fluffed notes, ringing open strings between phrases -- they're all there in their live, naked glory. Unlike some bands who will undertake repair work on a live recording to hide imperfections, Clapton and crew leave everything as is as an honest testament to the show as it happened that cloudy day.<br />As a musician, I find that kind of honesty thrilling. It's that kind of honesty that consistently draws me to live shows. Now, before you get the impression that the performance by the band is anything less than stellar, let me set the record straight: the band GROOVES! They're absolutely in the pocket and the music is wonderful. Best of all, it's obvious from the plentiful smiles that they're all having a great time. So, for me, the tiny imperfections don't detract from the show at all, they actually add to it.<br />This show captures Clapton and the band in fabulous form. Buy it; you won't be sorry you did.
B00005ARDC|5.0|As someone who still mourns the breakup of the Verve, I've found great comfort in BRMC.  When I first saw their video for &quot;Whatever Happened to My Rock 'N Roll?&quot; on MTV2, I was so excited to see their talent acknowledged and appreciated. Their self titled album is astonishing, and I like nearly every song on the album.  From &quot;Awake&quot; to &quot;White Palms,&quot; &quot;As Sure As the Sun,&quot; and &quot;Too Real,&quot; I'm lost in admiration.  Their songs are alternatively roaring, or soothing and ethereal, even when the topics may be negative. Having grown disgusted with the music industry (thanks to the proliferation of bubblegum pop), I'm grateful for the likes of BRMC and such clever lyrics and melodies.  And hey, they're local fellas! Let's hope they stay with us for some time to come.
B00003CX5P|1.0|As a fan who loved the sense of a universe of infinite alien species and civilizations conveyed by the initial trilogy, I found the sudden introduction of aliens with Asian (Trade Federation with slanted eyes), African/Jamaican (JarJar, the helpless idiot), and Arab (the slave-holding flying insect with the big nose) accents who ALL speak English, horribly distracting and annoying and, frankly, offensive. Watch the original movies and you're treated to subtitles when the aliens speak....because they're ALIENS. <br />What this movie sacrifices in authenticity, it does no make up for in plot, characterization, or special effects. In the end, Lucas is running a machine now, and the movie's ultimate subtext is that the creator has crossed over to the dark side, forsaken true creativity and taste for the sake of commoditizing Star Wars, his most successful brand more than film at this stage.<br />For no-holds-barred creativity and masterful storytelling, the Matrix, Dark City, Alien, Aliens, Blade Runner, 2001 are all truer and more compelling, and vastly superior by several orders of magnitude than this empty vessel. Lord of the Rings, which I just saw this week, soundly trumps Lucas's product with its blend of epic and intimate fantastical artistry. <br />It is sad to see what a waste Lucas has made of Star Wars. But at least we have the first two movies (episodes 4 and 5) to cherish.

0618001905|1.0|For such a large subject and the amount of research that supposedly went into this book I was expecting a larger book and more detail. Furthermore, on page 139 there is a song transcribed<BR>by a missionary which refers to an animal which has never been found in Africa and is highly unlikely to have even been heard of by the Africans at this time. A small point but it makes me wonder how throughly some of the rest of the facts in the book have been checked out.

B00005OC06|3.0|I've always thought Madama Butterfly was one of the most moving and enjoyable operas I've ever seen.  So, after stumbling upon the DVD here at Amazon, I thought these DVDs might make wonderful Christmas presents for others and myself -- especially after noticing that Mirella Freni was singing the role of Butterfly (and I can't complain about the rest of the cast either).<br />However, after watching this DVD, I'm not really sure how to characterize my disappointment.  The soundtrack is certainly wonderful -- if only I could listen to just the singing and music alone and imagine everything else.  Since this is a movie and not a taped performance, the actors are actually lip-synching (and doing an absolutely terrible job of it).  Furthermore, the acting, lighting, scenery, and makeup is pretty bad as well.  And, unfortunately, as much as I enjoy Mirella Freni's singing, she just can't come close to pulling off a sweet and innocent 15 year old -- obviously not, but the lack of this believability (especially in all the close up shots) kind of ruins it for me.  Perhaps I should be more realistic in what to expect from a movie version and what the actors can and cannot do etc., but all of these flaws still detract greatly from the overall experience.<br />Lastly, and maybe I'm mistaken, but everytime I see this opera live, the ending has always made Butterfly seem much more honorable, stoic, and as a result all the more pitiable and sad.  My impression is that this version kind of takes a different path.<br />Overall, I would recommend getting the wonderful Pavoratti and Freni CD available here at Amazon and supplementing that with tickets to see a live performance.  Again, maybe it's just me, but so far I have yet to find an opera DVD that has been half as enjoyable as seeing it in person.
B000002O7C|4.0|Considering that the movie was about a ship that that was \\"invisible\\" (submarines are never seen, only tracked by the noise they emit while submerged) Basil Poledouris's score for \\"Oktober\\" stands out.  Incredibly evocative of the cold war and the cold and dark places where it was fought (here, the North Atlantic), Poledouris's score uses electronic and orchestral movements that track the movie perfectly.  I prefer the first side to the second, though the recording concludes with a double climax: the shoot-out in the Red October's missile room and the submarine dogfight with Captain Tupolev (Stellan Skaarsgard).  In the film, the final cut of the battle scene seemed almost anti-climactic, but the soundtrack makes every last note almost deafening - well worth the price of the disc.  One caveat - I was hoping the disc would include \\"The Internationale\\" sung by Red October's patriotc crew as Sean Connery ordered ahead-full on the ship's silent drive, but it never made the cut.  Even if you only liked the film, this disc is a crucial addition to your soundtrack collection.
B000003BF1|2.0|Browsing thru Amazon can be especially fun in that it can give an old-timer a chance to sort thru old records to hear how differently they may sound after 30-plus years. This one,like any Stones album, simply sounds just as bad as ever, and the best part is the childs' choir at the beginning of YOU CANT ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT, which otherwise is another throwaway shouter with all of three chords. GIMME SHELTER does have a good beat, as does MIDNIGHT RAMBLER, but any good swing jazz can put them both away quickly. YOU GOT THE SILVER, virtually unknown, may be the best cut here,an acoustic ballad unlike most of this band's usual numbers. LET IT BLEED and LIVE WITH ME are two more misogynist duds, a mainstay of this quintet's repertoire. The staying power and legions of fans that still enjoy this stuff never cease to amaze, and their live concerts are even sillier given their age now, and the fact that their songs were written originally for rowdy youngsters. Well, to each his/her own.
B00001PE4D|4.0|From begining to end this movie will captivate you. The opening scene featuring the arogant therapist is a scream. I find Ryan Phillippe's character hard to belive but still fun to watch and well played. The scenes he plays with Sara Michelle Gellar are hot. And then there's &quot;The Kiss&quot; which if you don't know about by now need to see it. The ending was a little blah but still not bad enough to ruin the movie. Definatly something to buy.
B000001GQB|5.0|There are obviously many,many recordings of these classics. It does get tricky trying to differentiate between all these styles, and individual treatments. But to start with, I don't know of any single set of these works that tops this set.Plus here you have some of the Master's last pieces in one set,and they are among his best compositions, along with the last piano concertos. Each piece does have a special zing here. I only wish the 34th were included,but I have that one anyway. Especially recommended for the Mozart novice who may not know where to start!!!
B00003CXTF|1.0|I'm a Japanese in America. <br />I think this movie is an insult to Americans and a commedy (or a love story) to Japanese. <br />This is what I mean. <BR>Americans should know that there are two different versions of this movie, American version and Japanese version. Disney created Japanese version of script so that they can make a lot of money in Japan. In Japanese version, Americans are much nicer to Japanese, even Col.Dolittle is nice to Japan. Also, the scene where Japanese high command doing meeting to discuss Pearl Harbor attack outside where children are playing with kites....simply showing lack of common scene and intellect of Americans. As a Japanese living in America, I know this is wrong. I'm having hard time explaining about America to my Japanese friends who think that Americans &quot;innocently&quot; enjoy this movie.    <br />Some Japanese are sorry for Americans because of this movie. <BR>Would Americans create 9.11.01 love story or commedy? Would Americans create 9.11.01 movie where Americans are nice to terrolists? Do respect history and facts (and even enemy), but this one is way out of line. <BR> <BR>Pearl Harbor as an &quot;entertainment&quot;? Does that really make sense? <BR>This movie is the worst way to show what Pearl Harbor was. Japanese know better than that and respect America at least more than this movie does. <br />Americans enjoying this movie are sad to see. <BR>Watch Tora Tora Tora, that's The Pearl Harbor Movie.<br />Sorry for my English, it's my second language.
B00003CXTF|1.0|This is an icky, overblown, overacted travesty.  Some corny movies are good; this isn't one of them.  I thought it was dreadful.  The horrific special effects, however, were quite good, and did convey some visceral sense of how awful the attack on Pearl Harbor really must have been.  Still, what a cheap way to evoke painful memory.
B00003Q43A|1.0|I'm ashamed to admit in hind-sight that I was actually fired up about this movie before it was released.  We were bombarded with an upsurd advertisement campaign.  Every single cast member was invited onto at least one of the talk shows at least once a piece before the movie even hit theatres.  Fast food.  Action figures.  Magazines.  It was everywhere.  It was supposed to be the movie of the century!!! ... at least that was what we were being told.  And it looked like it probably would be.<br />Then I went to see it ... with eyes-wide and excited; hand buried in popcorn.  Then... I realized, about forty minutes in ... I'd been conned.  Never in my life did I feel so stupid ... I had fallen for it.  I had fallen foolishly for the most hyped movie of all time.<br />This wasn't the movie of the century... it was a two-hour commercial.  It was a scatter-brained, poorly-written, poorly-directed fiasco.  Other than the incredible special effects that went to waste on INDEPENDENCE DAY, the movie only deserved to be shown on the DISNEY CHANNEL... once.<br />A movie that was written so poorly that it went from joking around one second, to nuking Houston the next (anyone know anybody in Houston? ... apparently no one who made this movie did, because they sure didn't care).<br />An alien movie that was about as scary as your local christian church's haunted house.  A movie that couldn't figure out whether it wanted to be a comedy, a thriller, or a UPN movie of the week.<br />And then came the ... finale ... \\"I'M BACK!!!\\"  And they all came tumbling down.<br />Well, I won't be back.  And I learned a valuable lesson: Any movie who has to promote as heavily as INDEPENDENCE DAY had to, probably isn't worth the paper they used to write the script.  IF THERE WAS A SCRIPT????
0385505833|5.0|I must admit that I can relate to Luther Krank.Although I love Christmas, sometimes I feel that I can do without it. This book would certainly make a good movie.
6305064490|5.0|I watched this movie today for the first time in two years.  This is the best movie ever made in my opinion.  It is especially great to watch during the Christmas season.  If you own one movie on VHS or DVD, this is the one.  My VHS tape is the 45th Anniversary edition.  It includes the original trailer.  The trailer does not do this film justice.  If I had seen that trailer at the theater in 1946, I would have passed on this film.  I miss the mulitple airings of Christmas past.  If you have never seen this movie or have not seen it in a while, watch it this year.

B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is a trip through rock and truly a great Cd worthy of airplay.  I really can't see how anyone would want to bash a band of this caliber.  They ARE metal and they ARE great!<br />Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda make beautiful music alongside each other.  Chester, with his powerful screams, sets a nice metal tone among all the screaming idiots of today.  Mike, along with a great feel for hip-hop, busts out with some heavy words that hang in your brain.  Blasts of hip-hop and metal chords fill the songs and create a dark and drab place that many different artists try to achieve and fail in the process.  From &quot;Papercut&quot;, a great ballad that starts out the insanity of Hybrid Theory to &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; give you a sort of dark feel.  &quot;Runaway&quot; is the best song on the Cd to me because of it's childish and disturbing nature.<br />Linkin Park may be MTV's representation of Metal, but trust me, this Cd is not easy-listening-pop-band-garbage that spews from the pores of TRL.  It's tracks are set up perfectly, giving each member a chance to flex their talents while the lyrics are understandable and dark.  Chester mostly was writing about him being sexually abused and also being made fun of by kids.  I feel his pain and hope that every kid who was ever picked on look up to Chester because he really is a strong individual.  He shows everyone what they can do with their life.<br />Along with a killer Cd that has made them plenty, they have been pretty laided back about it.  They like success (who doesn't?) and success likes them.  They always hang out with the fans before and after the shows and also sign autographs for hours.  They know what it's like to be on the other end.<br />This Cd is a must buy for anyone who has a stitch of taste!  Along with the examples outlined, they rock big time at concerts!  So grab the Cd quickly to get in on the ground floor!
0393317552|2.0|The author presents a simple and credible set of ideas.  Unfortunately, far too much text is devoted to countless long-winded examples that don't add much insight or credibility to those ideas.  Instead of reinforcing the author's arguments, this serves to obscure them in the endless verbiage, and bores the reader into a coma.
B00005U2LM|4.0|THE NINE WARRIORS ARE BACK WITH THEIR FOURTH ALBUM IRON FLAG. EVEN THOUGH O.D.B IS MISSING THE WU COMES WITH THEIR TIGHTEST EFFORT SINCE ENTER THE WU-TANG (36 chambers) and WU-TANG FOREVER! THE HARDEST TRACKS ON ALBUM IS CHROME WHEELS, PINKY RING, IN THE HOOD, IRON FLAG, AND ONE OF THESE DAYS! RZA AND HIS PRODUCTION IS BACK TO ITS SUPERB LEVEL SOMETHING THAT LACKED IN THE WU'S LAST ALBUM THE W. I THINK WHAT MAKES THIS ALBUM STANDS OUT IS THAT WE HEAR MORE OF MASTA KILLA.

0767849493|5.0|A great film that questions the ideas of religious hypocrisy and extreme fundalmentalism. Nothing more than a fantasy , it puts forth the idea that ideas count more than beliefs , and how we shouldn't take every page of religious literature so seriously..after all thats how cults are started. Kevin Smith's writing is brilliant in this one , the humor while forced lowbrow is still hillarious. Jay and Silent Bob are as hillarious as ever , and they were given better screen time than in most of their previous films (except the new film which probably bites )...see it...it's not as offensive religiously as it was played out..but to you softcore types it's &quot;vulgar&quot;..
B00003CXTF|5.0|This movie is a must see! I know I will continue to watch it for years to come. One of the things I liked about the movie was the plot, it was not predictable like most movies I have seen. The action scenes were well done too, it kept me on the ege of my seat! I recommend this movie to everyone!!
B00005O5CM|5.0|Legally Blonde is the perfect movie to make you feel better. I love the way that Elle (Reese Witherspoon) totally proved everyone wrong about her. This movie proves that blondes are not dumb!<br />Witherspoon has so much charisma!
B000001E18|5.0|Zooropa hit the mark so much better than Achtung Baby. One of the few albums that I will always listen to beginning to end (even if it means taking the long way home!) I used to listen to this record on an aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean at midnight... the red lighting and industrial setting combined with Dirty Day to make up a religious experience! Quite possibly my favorite U2 album. The title track is mesmerizing; Babyface, Stay and The First Time are beautiful; Numb, Lemon, Daddy's Gonna Pay, Dirty Day... and then The Man In Black! Incredible!
B00005Q4CS|4.0|I just watched this on DVD. Definitely for the MTV generation. Very good visuals. The plot needed to be more interesting. Great perfomance by Ellen Burstyn.
B00005QW5X|5.0|This is my favorite movie all of time...i knew nothing about it when i walked in to the theatre, but it totally blew me away.....the characters, the music, the story....all incredible!  Once you see it, it will stay with you for a long  time....John Cameron Mitchell deserves an oscar

B00003CXAA|5.0|These are the movies that started it all.  All of today's modern day mafia movies are based on these movies.  I received this for Christmas and I love it.  If you like good drama and lots of action, then you need to pick this box set up.
0066620996|2.0|As with so many business books, this one lauds a few great companies (let us see where they are in 10 years) and then look at what they have in common.  <br />A couple of points....<br />(a)  Minor complaint since this book was written by Academics.  This is what anyone with elementary training in methodology or statistics would call selection on the dependent variable.  Select good companies then ask why they are good.  Look for commonalities.  Write a book.  Well how do you concretely test whether other companies have these traits or not?  <br />Proper testing would have been to select the entire universe of companies in some year (say 1950) and code each company based on all of these factors/vaiables and test the relationships between each of these &quot;variables&quot; and their stock price.(Who are these reviews that see this book as built on mountains of good data?)<br />(b)  Basically same thrust as the last book (built to last)..great companies built on an internal culture that (hopefully) encourages meritocracy, adaptability and innovativeness and solid management.  <br />Brilliant leaders don't help because by their nature they are one man shows and have trouble building solid management and culture to survive them.  <br />Similarly they are not apt to be one product companies because those product markets will change and they will have no new sources of growth (the Polaroid or Xerox problem).<br />I guess I just feel like the early points are clear in the beginning and can easily be summed up in two pages.<br />(c) Most importantly, even if we assume their points are correct, the tougher question remains.  How do we create the right corporate culture?  Many CEOs know their company has the wrong culture but have difficulty changing it.  Jack Welch was working on GEs for 20 years and it was not so bad to start with.<br />Why not study GE's culture?  Toyota's legendary ability to innovate.  Microsoft?  Intel?  All companies that have adapted particular cultures that demonstrates their ability to go head to head and consistently out think and out perform other companies.  How about an investment bank, where all the value is in the people and therefore culture and management would be even more important.<br />(e)  On the other hand, it is good to congratulate them on choosing companies that are not overstudied (GE) or gain huge competitive advantages because of a particularly business model, that while brilliant make it hard to assess the overall management of the firm (Dell, Walmart).   Looking at a bank (wells fargo), a consumer products firm (Gillette), and a retailer (Walmart) makes for interestign studies with which people are not familiar.<br />This seems to be the real key tough question.<br />(f)  Gillete is listed as a great company.  It trades at where it did in 1996/1997.  <br />Not to complain as all companies have their ups and downs and it is dangerous to do any study as inevitably at least one company in a study will be doing poorly, but doesn't this offer caution to any findings.
B00005JH9W|4.0|I watched Freaks for the first time about 15 years ago. While not well written or acted it portrays a true account of circus sideshow performers and asks you to look past their physical deformities and realize they have normal feelings. (If you have seen the animated film Toy Story then you have seen a remake of the revenge scene in Freaks.) I've had mixed reactions from friends that have seen this film but more favorable than not.
B00003CXXI|1.0|The characters were lovable enough, but to hear some critics rave about this film and to compare Monsters Inc as a knockoff, I was just insulted.  First of all, i saw Monsters Inc and thought it was delightful and very well done.  Then over the weekend I watched the movie Shrek which got such rave reviews and both my girlfriend and I thought the movie was garbage.  The story line by itself was just another fairy tale, but the comedy sounded like something created to draw an adult audience to the Myers/Murphy/Diaz/Lithgow names and all it did for me was insult my intelligence and waste my time.  Given the chance to watch it again, I would gladly ask for a dental appointment instead.
B00003CX5P|1.0|...<br />The sound and picture quality are great, but the added bonus scenes they put in the movie are completely worthless.  It was completely a case of \\"We can so we will.\\"  There's a great quote from Ian Malcolm in Jurassic Park: \\"You were so worried about whether or not you could you didn't stop to think about whether or not you SHOULD.\\"  The pod-race scene is now way too long and choppy, and the other added scenes completely broke the flow of the movie.  The one where JarJar comments on the Queen to Anakin is hilarious, but that's the only worthwhile addition.<br />To top it off, some of the deleted scenes that they DIDN'T put in the movie are great and SHOULD have been put back in.  They are transition scenes that explain a lot about the next scenes (like why Anakin is tired when running to the ship while leaving Tatooine.)  The commentary and documentaries are great for the hard-core fan, but the version of the film they put on disk one is just pathetic.  I do hope Lucas releases another DVD that you can choose which version you wish to watch.
B000002C1V|4.0|I really had low expectations of this album, but now not so. Whilst clearly bleak, it still posseses much of the qualities of The Wall: Humour (Not Now John) cool noises and blatant Comfortably Numb style songs (The Final Cut). Gilmour shines, particulary on Fletcher..., adding a very Animals touch. Production is absolutely beautiful, perhaps the best sounding Floyd album and being shorter than its predecessor, it becomes The Wall which you don't need to set aside an evening for. <BR>I am still yet to know what 'holophonics' are, though
B0000039QA|5.0|Anyone who ever heard Biggies' voice felt its power and magnetism.  His delivery is impossible to duplicate (Shyne?) and the heavy rasp his signature.  On his debut album, he was hungry; wanting a piece of the luxury and good life others possessed.  On Life After Death, he sees life as not all it is cracked up to be once you are on top. The effect of the hating, jelousy and fear of his own death are evident through this album, making it deeper, darker, and even better than his first classic.  The album opener &quot;Somebody Gotta Die&quot; sets the tone with story of a feud resulting in a drive by with a haunting ending.  &quot;Mo Money, Mo Problems&quot; captures his overall feeling, that ultimately the more you have, the more you have to worry about.  Don't get me wrong, Biggie still delivers the tales of playful excesses through hard hitters like &quot;Hypnotize&quot;, (with the smooth Herb Alpert, &quot;Rise&quot; sample) and &quot;Going Back to Cali&quot; (with its Roger Troutman-esque sound).  He boasts his sexual bravado through &quot;Nasty Boy&quot; (with Vanity 6 sample) and a new bedroom anthem called &quot;I'm @#$%in You Tonight&quot; (with R. Kelly).  He shows his ability to flow through any style with anybody shows through &quot;Life&quot; w/Lox and with one of the best songs, &quot;Notorious Thugs&quot; in which Biggie outshine Bone-Thugs and Harmony at their own game.  He also reinforces being called the master storyteller through &quot;I Gotta Story to Tell&quot; (a playful story of a sexual encounter w/a close call) and the best of the album, &quot;@#ggas Bleed&quot;, a chilling story with swelling production that will leave you feeling like YOU are in that hallway by story end.  He rips through &quot;Kick In The Door&quot; with his unparalled, trademark power and fervor. There are also songs of sadness and loss like &quot;I Miss U&quot; (w/112) and songs of optimism, hope and fatherhood in &quot;Sky's The Limit.&quot; (which includes a nice Bobby Caldwell sample)  However, the album ends in death as it begins, as Biggie describes how people only remember you when you are gone in the eerie &quot;You're Nobody Till Somebody Kills You.&quot; With his death before this albums' release, you can't help but remember his last days after 2Pacs' death, where he seemed to know he was next.  It is a classic through his vocals alone, but in light of his sudden demise, it is a haunting,insightful look into the last days of a departed legend.
6302732875|5.0|Wasn't sure how Mamet's play would work as a film, but this is actually one of the greatest films ever made. The cast, particulaty Lemon and Pacino are superb, with great 'blasts' from Pacino, and a Lemon character similar to that of Save the Tiger. The whole film if fiery and confident. I would say that this is Lemon's best film and really proves just what you can do with a great script alone.

I will wait for a Box set; rumors are that Paramount in Germany will release this as a Box set(maybe with an English language track?).<BR>Anyway, if ARTISAN would have released this as a set, I would have bought it - at any price, by the way( so their's no financial reason not to release it as a set).

068485743X|1.0|If one word describes The First Five pages, it is misleading..., no arrogant..., no, annoying ..., a rewrite of something much shorter and better-The Elements of Style.<br />The title is misleading. If anything, this book should be subtitled \\"Elements of editing\\", not \\"The Writer's Guide on staying out of the Rejection pile\\". [But who would have bought it with such a title?] Nothing is said on how to satisfy an agent or publisher. The most we learn about agents and publishers is they are overworked, underpaid, and omnipotent. Noah Lukeman then tells us many have little experience, and only really want to reject a manuscript to reduce their workload. Nowhere does he tell us how to work within this framework. <br />The entire premise of The First Five pages is arrogance. The premise is agents and publishers can quickly identify good and bad work without consideration of the story. Lukeman tells us how \\"common mistakes\\" in presentation, dialogue, characterization, hooks, and tone will torpedo a submission. Get these right and you will receive immediate interest. The realtor's advise of \\"paint the front door\\" is throughout. <br />Strangely, Lukeman ridicules the efforts of writers with academic, journalistic or other backgrounds. Anything other than poverty is suspicious-the struggling writer in a garret is superior to a writer with success elsewhere as if there is something redeeming about failure.<br />The tone is elitist-only those anointed by God really know how to write. Many of the references reinforce this point. They are those wordy \\"classics\\" we were forced to read in the ninth grade. Nowhere is there the notion that reading and writing should be fun.<br />The best one word description is annoying--annoyance that I foolishly thought the title had something to do with this book. This work can be read as a condemnation of the publishing industry or as help in editing, but not how to stay out of the slush pile.
B00005RDAF|1.0|This DVD is extremely misleading.  On the back cover, it lists &quot;HBO presents: Britney Spears live from Las Vegas&quot; as one of the features.  One would assume that this is the concert that aired on HBO a few weeks ago.  IT'S NOT!!!  It's a commercial advertising the concert.  That is ridiculous.  Save your money and buy something else.  You don't find out that it's a commercial until you've already opened the DVD and played it.  By that time, you can't take it back.  It would be ridiculous to waste any amount of money on this skimpy DVD.  Half of the other stuff on the DVD can be found in the enhanced features on the Britney CD.  And, if you want to see the videos, they are played on MTV frequently.  Don't waste your money.

B00005QIPH|4.0|So much has already been said and written about The Strokes, it seems almost pointless to add my two cents, but after listening to the CD for the fifth time in a row I feel compelled. No, they're not the &quot;Greatest Rock N' Roll Band&quot; ever, nor even the greatest band right now. But, I don't think all the hoopla is necessarily about their playing, or even their songs, but their ATTITUDE has struck a massive chord with a lot of disenchanted music lovers. The music IS great: energetic, driving, raw, and FUN, whether or not it's wholly original. Radiohead may be opening new doors with every album, but Jesus they're becoming such esoteric downers. And forget about what's on the radio. Of course there are always tons of indie bands out there offering up this same attitude, but without the type of buzz the media has created they won't be &quot;saving&quot; rock n' roll. A lot of people are placing all their chips on the success of The Strokes because they represent a new direction in rock. A direction that is akin to what happened in 1992 with Nirvana (and I'm not comparing the two bands musically), a breath of fresh air in a stagnant musical landscape. Let's all hope that happens.
B00005O5CM|4.0|That could have been the title of this movie.  If you liked &quot;Clueless&quot;, you'll like this one.  It's about a &quot;dumb&quot; blonde who isn't taken seriously buy her boyfriend.  So she decideds to go to Harvard Law School to get him back to prove that she's smart enough for him.
B00004XPP0|5.0|Star Wars... what hasn't been said about these great films?  This is the best story.  By the time you have finished the trilogy you will love these films.  From the action of lightsaber fight scenes and intense space dog-fights, to the antics of C-3PO &amp; R2-D2 and the cute lovable Ewoks.  These movies have everything. A classic story of good &amp; evil, to the love story of Han and Leia to the infamous line, &quot;Luke, I am you're father&quot;.  These are the BEST movies ever.  Buy the trilogy, and rent Episode 1 (Which was in my opinion, not Lucas's best.  George you can do better!) So buy this trilogy, and I'll see you in line for Episode 2!
B00005OWIU|5.0|Being from Boston, I always associate the Pops with John Williams.  He's a Beantown prodigal son, and hearing a score like this makes the loss of him SO hard to bear - even now. <br />Honestly, I didn't know ahead of time that Williams composed the music for Potter, but it was pretty obvious as soon as the rolling titles came up that THIS was his music.  It's beautiful.  The melodies are magical, and complimented the movie perfectly - there's a child-like wonder in the theme that suits Potter.  From the Prologue all the way to the last track on the disk (Hedwig's Theme), you can actually SEE the scenes playing in your head.  That's how memorable this music is. <br />I would recommend this to any John Williams fan, as well as anybody looking for something soothing, fun, quiet, and magical.  Actually, I would recommend this to anyone now that I think of it . . . you will not be disappointed with this score.  It may be one of the best yet!<br />Happy listening!
B00005Q45W|2.0|Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But. . .I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.
B000056K04|1.0|Apparently Dave Matthews decided to take a cue from Aerosmith and have Glen Ballard write half of his new album in the hopes of selling more records.  Well, lets just say its not gonna make him the next Beatles.  Matthews' music has always been pretty bad, due mostly to his horribly annoying voice, but now its not just awful in a jam-band, frat-boy music kind of way.  Now its bad in a sellout pop kind of way too.  &quot;I did it&quot; is tolerable, until you hear it for the second time, and &quot;the space between&quot; is probably the most annoying single of the year.  It seems like whenever I'm in my car this song comes on the radio and even the first few opening bars are enough to make me sick to my stomach.  Now &quot;everyday&quot; is the lastest of Matthew's songs to be shoved down the public's throat by corporate radio and VH1, and it comes with a &quot;lets cash-in on the 9/11 tragedy&quot; video complete with an american-flag hat and hugs for all.  Dave should have stuck with patronizing the college kids like he used to and then maybe after 4 or 5 more unoriginal jam-style records and numerous extra cash-in live recordings he could have tricked people into thinking his band was the next Grateful Dead.  Not much to aim for, admittedly, but now with Everyday he's flushed half his fans down the toilet for a bit of mainstream success.  Don't worry, it'll catch up with him.
B00005QCYC|4.0|These three films are truly a saga, but each have their own traits.  The first film, JURASSIC PARK, generated fantastic, realistic, and the most incredible ideas ever written for a movie.  Excitement and top of the line storytelling truly add to this film.  As for THE LOST WORLD, another masterpiece was created.  Special effects are spellbounding in this film and the story, although difficult for some people to follow, is truly well told by Michael Crichton and David Koepp.  This film adds much more adventure than the first film and doubles in excitement due to the new film score mixed with the old one composed by John Williams.  Finally, the third film comes along, JURASSIC PARK III, and adds sort of a dissapointment.  Within the third film, the thrill of seeing Alan Grant return is portrayed, but the class to it is lost thanks to brainless writing from new-coming writers Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne, and Jim Taylor.  A new comedey angle is taken with the characters and deletes much of the adrenaline to the film.  Another factor that deletes this feeling of true excitement is the newcoming composer Don Davis.  The score was not well done and did not fit the style to Jurassic Park.  John Williams should have done this score.  Had he done so, this film may have still had some class to it, but Davis's score was not the one to go with.  It also would have been nice to see some better writers and many other credits.  Joe Johnson has his legacy in other films, but this was not the one for him to take.  This ultimately should have been A Steven Spielberg Film, and a better story should have been waited for.  As for its addition to the series, I find it unneccessary.  The only parts to it that make it great to buy and have for your Jurassic Park collection is: 1) It is a Jurassic Park movie, like it or not.  2) The science is true for the most part and you can be well educated, especially with the raptor call which has actually been done on hadrosaurs.  3) If you get tired of watching the T-Rex stomp everywhere, it is really nice to see the Spinosaurus jump in, however unfortunate to hear the film score by Don Davis ruin Spiny's big moments.  For the most part, this whole Jurassic Park collection is great to have and I recommend purchasing it if you want to recieve chills of fun and adventure.  Even though the thrid one is a dissapointment for writers and critics, some, like myself, just have to say &quot;Oh hell, it's a fun ride and I'm gonna buy it anyway!&quot;
B00004XOWM|1.0|There's really no point of even writing a review of this record because anyone with even half a brain cell knows this record is garbage.  But why not.<br />I guess if you really, really like corporate rock, Limp Bizkit is perfect for you.  Even NSYNC spend less time out golfing with their label executives.  Chocalate Starfish is also for you if your ideal rock star is an overweight gansta-wannabe who doesn't even go to the McDonalds drive-through without a security guard.  Note to Fred:  Dr. Dre you ain't.  Although I suppose if I made music as bad as you, I'd want to be protected from the public too.<BR>Also, if you've recently discovered these things called &quot;swear words&quot; like Fred apparently has, you'll also love this record, cause he uses them a bunch.  How cool!  I wish I could come up with lyrics as deep and meaningful as &quot;Keep rollin, rollin, rollin.&quot;  I bet bands like Pearl Jam and Nine Inch Nails just wish they were cool enough to get to do a duet with Christina Aguilera on MTV, but they just aren't cool enough I guess.  Maybe someday.
B000002HH9|2.0|I really really wish I could like this album, but I can't.  I've owned it since the day it came out, and once or twice a year I listen to it in a hope that it'll grow on me.  The sad fact is the entire album is made of throw-away songs, with the exception of one: Jupiter Crash, which is one of the best Cure songs of the last decade.  This Is a Lie is also good, and worthy of the Cure, but then in better days it simply would have been a great B-Side.  The rest is is all throw-away.  Want reminds me of Open, but then I just listened to Open and Want pales in comparison.  <br />And it's not that this album isn't &quot;goth&quot; enough that I don't like it -- I would hardly call Japanese Whispers goth, but I love all the songs on that album.  For that matter Kiss Me3 is far, far from goth, but that's one of the best albums of all time.  The songs on this album are bland, lifeless, and feature some of the worse lyrics Robert has ever written.  <br />What's sad is that the majority of the people who like this album are the very same people who ten years earlier would have labeled the Cure and their fans as &quot;freaks&quot; and worse.  On the Wish tour, I saw the Cure in Chicago, and it was a sad sight when a bunch of frat boys and their girlfriends in front of us sat there like zombies through the entire show until &quot;Friday I'm in Love&quot; and then they got up and were dancing and singing all the words.  A scary sight.  Then the Cure goes and makes an entire album just for them.  Thankfully, with Bloodflowers, Robert's gone back to his essence and has stopped playing the fool to these people.
B00005B4GU|3.0|Top Ten Reasons this album sucks:<BR>1.  Leftovers from Kid A<BR>2.  Radiohead were too chicken to release a double album so they made the fans wait eight months to fork out an extra ($$$).<BR>3.  Whiny, and not in a razor-edged Billy Corgan sort of way but in a \\"kick me and put me out of my misery\\" sort of way.<BR>4.  Does anyone really believe Thom Yorke is as depressed as he tries to be in these songs?<BR>5.  A lack of coherent song stucture does not automatically make music experimental.  It just makes music harder to listen to.<BR>6.  Lyrics whining about the pressures of fame, doing interviews and touring are pretty hypocritical coming from a band that has long ago reached the point where it doesn't have to do anything it doesn't want to.<BR>7.  Listen to the first 10 seconds of Mourning Bell.  Need I say more?<BR>8.  Radiohead fans are so annoying that the whole time you'll just feel embarassed listening to something so overrated.<BR>9.  If you examine the packaging closely you can see the lame attempts Yorke and Co. used to try and make themselves seem all cool and fractured and mysterious.<BR>10.  Because I said it does.<br />On the plus side, the song \\"I might be wrong\\" is really good.  I'm sure Yorke didn't intend it, but when I hear it I like to imagine that its a song about how he realized that the rest of Amnesiac is garbage and he might be wrong about, well, basically everything Radiohead has done in the last few years.  I gave the album three stars 'cause its fun to listen to just for a laugh to see what all the fans are so obsessed about.  Kinda like a Britney Spears record.  <br />Otherwise, the hordes of Radiohead fanatics realizing they might be wrong?  Not very good.
B00005BL2A|1.0|There are absolutely NO good songs on &quot;Exciter&quot;.  There are no decent ones, either.  At best, this is a mediocre offering from Depeche Mode.  The thing that bothered me the most about this album is that Dave's voice RUINED the songs.  I never thought I'd see the day where I would actually say that about my favourite band, but it's absolutely true.  Oh, and one of the previous reviewers who commented that Dave's voice was too high up on the mix was right; Dave's voice smothers the music in the background (on some songs, I could hardly hear any of the music in the background because of his vocals, even though the backing music was meant to be heard).  And as I strained to get past his horrible vocals, I actually found some hints of musical greatness... too bad they didn't last, and aren't consistent.   <br />The only place where Dave sounds like himself, and not some Americanised Brit sounding like an American dolt is on &quot;Dead of Night&quot; where he sings the words 'All we're demanding/You'll supply.  All we're accused of/We'll deny'.  Yeah, I know the lyrics are awful, too.  Anyway, that's the ONLY spot on the whole CD where his voice is as deep as it was on previous albums.  I don't know whether or not the album was produced that way in order to make up for his voice being weak, or not, but it sounds AWFUL.  It also puzzles me as to why they did it that way only on the songs where Dave does the lead vocals, because on the ones where Martin sings lead, Martin's voice was at the same level as the music.  Anyway, this is not the amazing Depeche Mode I remember from the days of &quot;SOFAD&quot; and before; it's only bits and pieces.  Also, the vocals on this album repeat WAY too much that it's just overkill (most of the songs could've ended around three minutes, but go on for six and a half minutes).  And the fact that the word &quot;love&quot; is used so carelessly really bothered me (it was EVERYWHERE on this album, and there was no need for it to be).  It loses all emotional meaning after you hear it so many times.  Words like that should be used sparingly, and are not to be thrown about (especially on albums).  Plus, what was with Depeche Mode's need to end on an upbeat not on EVERY song excluding the creepy little ending (which was a refreshing transition from the bland previous six minutes) on &quot;I am You&quot;?  <br />*Best Songs (these are by no means good; they just stand out):<BR>Dream On, Shine, Dead of Night. <br />*Worst Songs:  Sweetest Condition (I'd take the clangy &quot;Pipeline&quot; over the twangy &quot;Sweetest Condition&quot;... it's THAT bad.), Breathe (the lyrics cracked me up), and Comatose. <br />And, no, Dave, I can't &quot;Feel a little love&quot;, because your singing made me feel a little gypped.<br />P.S.<BR>This is the ONLY Depeche Mode album where I've actually cringed at a song.  It was on &quot;Sweetest Condition&quot;.  Who the heck thought it would be a good idea for DM to go country?!  Ugh.<br />This album isn't Depeche Mode for the fans, it's depeche money for the band.  Translation:  DM is in need of some seriously quick cash.
B00004SST6|5.0|George Benson started it all with Breezin'. Now, years later, he is still producing consummate work. How does he do it?<br />'The Ghetto', 'Deeper Than You Think', 'Medicine Man'... these tracks have enhanced my life and enriched it. And isn't that what music is all about? God bless George!

0767853636|3.0|You know what? This movie is overly schmaltzy and over-acted and overly 'nice' but hey, I must have watched this a hundred times when I was a kid, and I'm not too proud to say that I can still identify with it now. I wanted to be Grace when I was little, and I'd still love to be now. How politically incorrect is that? hehe.... It's a fairy tale, and it feels good, and I'll take that any day.<br />Anyway, neat music, a sound Broadway background for the story and, with actors who were really actors, who could sing and dance as well as look pretty<br />My favourite things about Annie - Carole Burnett as Miss Hannigan and of course Anne Reinking as Grace Farrell. &lt;sigh&gt;<br />I'll watch this till I burn the tape out :)
0790729628|3.0|2002 marks the 20th anniversary of this landmark film's release, and I echo the previous reviews' sentiment about the need for a definitive dvd version - preferrably with commentary by both the director and the stars, Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer.  The plot I'm sure you know by now after some five hundred reviews ...I won't repeat it.  As far as the director's cut, by and large it's an improvement (doing away with the original voice-over) on the theatrical release version, with the exception of the somewhat incongruous unicorn dream sequence.  The real star of the movie remains, for me, after twenty years and many repeat viewings, the jaw-dropping set design of a futuristic Los Angeles.  An indisputable all-time sci-fi classic.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I just love this album. It has great music and great lyrics.  It is definitely one of the most favorite CDs of mine.  I was just reading one review by an editor from Amazon.com.  It looks like the person does not like this CD.  I just feel sorry for him because I think he is missing a lot.  I did think John Mayer's voice sounds like Dave Matthews, but so what?  All songs are still very original and good.  Best of all, John Mayer's songs make me smile.  They are fun boys' songs.  Especially, the ways John Mayer describes his girlfriend and himself are so comical yet beautiful.  John Mayer does not use fancy words like Sting does (don't get me wrong, I love Sting too), but I can totally find one romance world in his music.  It is just sad to see some people spend too much time on criticizing, and cannot simply enjoy what is good.  Well, maybe that is their job.  For those of you who have not heard this CD, just ignore the editor's comments.  This is a very good CD.
B00005R87Q|5.0|I admit upon first seeing the preview I was unsure if this was a film to enjoy. Imports were more of an annoyance of mine as I have a preference to the muscle cars of the 60's and early 70's. The reason I agreed to see it came from the quick flash of a '68 Dodge Charger standing up on its rear wheels. Upon sitting down I was preparing for the the high pitch megaphone tail pipes to begin wailing but found myself appreciating the time and effort put into to each of these cars. The imports I have been shown main &quot;mods&quot; have been said tail pipe, some wheels, and a slew of stickers. Naturally the Charger didn't let me down and got goose bumps seeing the garage door open to pour light on the massive black beast with a blower set atop the heart of the monster. At the advise of a friend I sat through the entire credits to find a beautiful '70 Chevelle menacing the Mexican landscape. I recommend seeing this film if you are fascinated by cars in any respect and may hopefully come away with a new found respect to the import market.
0767836324|4.0|This DVD holds our house record for the longest continous time in the DVD player- 9 straight days.  My kids wouldn't watch anything else after we got it.<br />I've enjoyed this movie much more watching it at home than I did when it was released in the theaters.  It's hard to explain why.   Maybe because my children can watch it.  It may be because the Dolby 5.1 surround is crisp and the careful transfer is wonderfully clean.  Could be that Neverland is green again, unlike the brown I recall in the theater.  <br />Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams received very little credit for their work in this film, but should have.  Both are very enjoyable in their scenes.  Not many bonus features are available on this disc, however.<br />This movie suffers from what many of Spielberg's films suffer from-  impossibly high expectations, and the shadows of blockbusters like E.T., Jaws, and Close Encounters.  Still, it is a fine addition to your Spielberg collection.  And your kids will love it.
B00004Y62T|5.0|I am a VERY big fan of dark movies - and an even BIGGER one of gorgeous cinematography.  Which is why I liked this movie.  Matt Damon is truly incredible.  Other reviewers have stated they cannot understand why he lies throughout the movie, seemingly, &quot;for no reason.&quot;  I COMPLETELY understand his character.  I, too, lied to people &quot;for no reason&quot; - but in reality, I had a reason - I lied to get others to accept me and like me.  I feared that if they knew the truth, they would shun me.  That extreme fear of rejection caused many problems for me.  You find yourself telling bigger and more fantastic lies to cover the smaller ones.  You also find yourself lying when you don't really have the need to - because it's become so commonplace.  Tom Ripley needs to lie for these reasons and for another - he's killed a man he loves.  What happens after that is intriguing.  Gwyneth Paltrow isn't very good in this movie, but Jude Law - playing the quintessential rich jerk, Dickie (true to his name, I guess) - was great.  The ending, like &quot;American Beauty,&quot; is very shocking and extremely sad.  I intend to read the book very soon.
B00005RFQ5|1.0|As a long time (over 20 years) Prince fan.  I could not wait until the latest Prince album was in stores. I'd run out and buy it.  No more!  The Rainbow Children is absolutely horrible.  The free-spirited talent I once loved is no more.  He has replaced his vitality and individuality for dogmatic religious babble. Some of the instrumentation is good, especially compared to the bland tracks that are out there now.  However that is not enough to save this sinking ship. I was so thoroughly disappointed with this album after listening to it that I did not even bother to buy.  The Rainbow Children and Chaos &amp; Disorder are the only two Prince albums missing from my collection, and for good reason.  They are both terrible excuses for music from someone who has the potential to produce something much greater.  What a sad sad sight.  Why do I here Billy from Purple Rain right now, in the scene where he told the kid that no one dug his music anymore but him?  Is life truly imitating art?
B00005JKQX|4.0|I saw 2 fantastically different and wonderful movies today, \\"LOTR\\" and \\"A Beautiful Mind\\". Russell Crowe seems to act with ease even in the most difficult roles. Which makes me wish that they had written in the even darker demons that posessed John Nash. Paul Bettany makes another brilliant entrance and is someone I look forward to seeing more of in the future. Pay attention. There is a twinkle in Russell's eyes when he truly connects with someone he's acting with, be it animal or person. There is a flash of brilliance that you should look for, the inside shared secret, being part of the connection. Jennifer Connolly is as talented as she is beautiful. These 2 films are winners in my book of movies for the year.

Realizing what is really like considering I am 13 and have wanted to be a Marine since I was about three or four years old.  All military personal and family should read this, it gives you a look into a secert operation that stayed secret for many, many years.  Read, enjoy, and have a box of tissue handy I promise this book will make you cry.
B00005MP58|1.0|We enjoyed very much of this outstanding miniseries on the VHS tapes. So, we bought this Special Edition DVD for Christmas - repeated playing would wear out the VHS tapes.<br />BAD thing about this DVD:<BR>Like many reviewers here had said already.  Awful awful colors, especially on the disk one. There is way too much contrast, bringing the lights and darks to extremes. The outdoor scenes hurt my eyes!  Everyone looks ill; and it's hard to tell where darkness end and hair starts on most characters. The furnitures have no detail, they just disappear into the darkness.<br />GOOD things about this DVD:<BR>1) Widescreen, although I doubt that I missed anything on the VHS format.<BR>2) The removal of episodes end credits.<BR>3) It has the closed captioning (subtitle) in English.  It let me see what they are saying.<BR> <BR>Let the buyer beware!!
0790725657|5.0|I am on winter break from college and originally saw this movie because I was too lazy to get up and change the channel, but it ended up being one of the best things that has ever happened.  Perhaps I was meant to not get up and change the channel, because this movie was amazing.  I'll be straight, fully aware of the very real threat of endless peer ridicule, this movie is the first time I almost shed a tear while watching a movie since I saw 'My Girl' when I was much younger.  I suggest purchasing two copies of this movie in case one of them gets scratched when you want to watch it.  I also suggest getting some Haagan Daaz to intensify the movie watching experience.  Watch this movie and then email me, we will discuss, kleenex in hand.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Call it what u want- selling out or maturing, this is the best incubus album so far. It has a little something for everyone. &quot;Blood On the Ground&quot; will please old school incubus fans because of the hard rock. &quot;11 am&quot; is a great acoustic song, which &quot;drive&quot; fans will like. &quot;Just a Phase&quot; and &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; are two weird, but good songs. GREAT ALBUM!!!
B0000009S3|5.0|Amazing movie for your ears! This music would never be recorded<BR>in these times, because it is too original. Get this CD and let it transport you to another planet. 1,000 stars.
B0000027G6|5.0|John Barry gives music a new quality. His gracefullness in this score is simply magnificent. The melodies are unforgettably touching, almost timeless. Tracks 2 and 13, John Dunbar, have the same name. But if anyone has seen the movie, the changes Dunbar goes through from the beginning to end are very dramatic. It's the same with the soundtrack. The mood of the melodies change with time. A very well done score. 5 stars!
B00005JKHP|5.0|This is the digitally remastered Star Trek: The Motion Picture. There is so much in here !!! Besides everything looking better because they redid the film and the effects look awesome. But whats really great is the deleted scenes and all the bonus material. Its great !! Start your Star Trek collection off with this or even if you own it....throw the old copy away and pick this up !!!!
B00004STPT|2.0|I was pretty let down by this soundtrack.  The score was plain and boring. Hans Zimmer usually writes wonderfully worthy music. The theme was weak and held no convincing emotion. It wasn't until track 17 when I started to enjoy it. That's probably the only track that stood out. Lisa Gerrard is a fine singer. However, she gets irritating after a while because the melodies are so arid and flat. The movie was missing here. If you have the movie do not bother getting the soundtrack. It's a real let down.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|Paul Newman and Robert Redford are two of the biggest movie stars of all time.  They are also the best of friends and that friendship shines through on their first film together, Butch Cassidy &amp; The Sundance Kid.  The film is set in the old west, but it has a definite 60's feel to it.  Butch and Sundance are anti-heroes who defy the &quot;establishment&quot; by robbing trains.  Finally the train company gets fed up and sends an elite team of bounty hunters to track them down.  This inspires the film's classic catchphrase, &quot;who are those guys&quot; as Butch &amp; Sundance can't shake their pursuers.  The film has a light comical side to it as Mr. Newman is at his charming best as Butch and Mr. Redford elicits laughs as the uptight Sundance.  Katherine Ross provides a pretty diversion as Sundance's beautiful schoolteacher girlfriend, Etta Place.  Mr. Newman &amp; Mr. Redford are instantly likable in the lead roles and you can feel their real affinity for one another come through in the film.  The movie was a major box office hit and won and William Goldman won an Oscar for his crisp and witty script and But Bacarach and Hal David won an Oscar for the film's theme song &quot;Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head&quot; which B.J. Thomas took to number one in late 1969.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I like this CD alot.  It took a few listens but I really like it.  I started off liking the initial single &quot;Hey Baby&quot; but the entire CD is very well done.  The unmistakable vocals of Gwen, still the catchy ska beats but they have woven a lot of early 80's new wave in thier music.  There is one song which was written by Prince and the title escapes me now but that one is almost as good as &quot;Hey Baby&quot;.  This one isn't as good as &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; but I think that is only because that was the world's first real listen to the No Doubt sound. I think they are in a transition stage right now and more than likely what comes out of them next will be stellar.
B00004U5SC|5.0|Shane might well be the greatest western ever made and a true American classic.  Recently in a New York Times article, Woody Allen of all people considered it the best American film of all time.  The movie is about a mysterious stranger who unexpectently comes into a homestead family's life and helps in their battle against a greedy landowner who is threatening them to move off their land.  Alan Ladd stars in the title role and he exudes an air of calm control and dark mystery.  Shane is an expert gunman and a skilled fighter, but he doesn't want any trouble.  He tries hard to avoid a fight in the local saloon, but no matter how hard he tries, trouble finds him.  The homestead family is played by Van Heflin, Jean Arthur and the young Brandon De Wilde.  Mr. De Wilde is excellent as a wild-eyed youngster who grows to idolize Shane.  Mr. Heflin plays the strong, defiant landowner, but also loving husband to his devoted wife, played tenderly by Ms. Arthur, and his son.  He stands by his new friend Shane, when the other homesteaders want him to leave when they feel he's stirring up trouble.  A young Jack Palance is menacing as an icy hired gun hired to drive the homesteaders off their land.  The showdown between him and Shane is a tense and taut showdown.  Director George Stevens captures the breathtaking beauty of the American Old West.  Shane was nominated for several Academy Awards, but failed to win any.  Despite that fact, it remains a brilliant film worth repeated viewings.
0792846443|5.0|Misery was arguably Stephen King's most personal book, a nail biter of a story that explored the horrible effects of both his substance abuse and considerable fame on his life.  The story is Hitchcockian in its simplicity.  Paul Sheldon, a successful writer of gothic/historical romances, is celebrating.  He has killed off Misery, his romance series heroine, and written his first 'real' (i.e. literary) novel in years.  Then disaster strikes...his car slides off the road during a blizzard and, severely injured, he awakens bedridden in the home of Annie Wilkes, his &quot;Number One Fan.&quot;  Sheldon gradually becomes aware that the woman is dangerously unbalanced and has no intention of releasing him, ever.  The game of cat and mouse he must play with Annie will have you on the edge of your seat.  Rob Reiner keeps the suspense building and William Goldman's script is a delight (although the intimate insider look at a writer's creative process that King's novel had sadly cannot be communicated visually).  An essential in any King fans cinema library.  My only quibble with the disc (which offers both a full frame and widescreen presentation) is that the hilarious trailer featuring a Christmas from Hell narration (while 'The Little Drummer Boy' plays in background) is absent, the included teaser and trailer are both pretty much standard issue hostage thriller stuff.  So it goes.
B00005JKMO|5.0|If you consider yourself to be a true movie buff, Mohammed Ali, or Will Smith fan, you will truly enjoy this movie.  Will Smith did an outstanding job in assimilating himself to Mohammed Ali' personna.  It is a great work, and a must have for a home collection!
B00004TDTO|5.0|Nothing else has had quite the effect on me as this movie.  To me it is nearly perfect, a well crafted monster movie that seems to effortlessly invoke a sense of phobic terror whenever anyone gets anywhere near, much less in, the water.  Although Roy Scheider is a delight as Brody and Richard Dreyfuss engaging as Matt Hooper, it is the larger than life characterization of Quint by Robert Shaw that owns the movie.  Mattey's Mechanical Shark isn't half bad either, although it's constant malfunctions kept it off camera for most of the movie.  A happy accident that only served to increase the film's already considerable power.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, by all means do so asap.  They just do not make monster movies better than this.  An essential action/monster movie for any film buff's library.<br />The disc is nearly as good as the movie.  It contains numerous deleted scenes, outtakes, storyboards, and trailers.  Too bad the incredible making of documentary has been cut to about an hour in length from its original two hour running time.  Perhaps some day MCA will do another box set special edition for the DVD release and offer the restored documentary.
B00003CXFV|5.0|This was a great movie for me. I was not expecting a lot from it, but at the end I watched it 3 times. It is fun, relaxing, you spend a very nice time. I really recomend it.
B0000399WI|4.0|Stephen King's short novel Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redempton was the first person narrated tale of how a friendship between a murderer and an unjustly imprisoned, and quite special, man reawakened the murderer's soul.  Although Tim Robbins plays the character the events of the story revolve around, it is his effect on Morgan Freeman's narrating character that is the film's true focus, for it is the slow forming of that emotional bond that gives this beautifully made film its power.  Highly recommended.
B00005A3KS|5.0|Whououou...!!!<BR>For me a cult movie. One of thoses cool movies you want to buy.<BR>Everything is there. beauty, fun, action, sky diving, surfing and good music.<BR>I loved it
B00005QK3W|2.0|It seems as if Paul McCartney is slowly and painfully drying up.  It seems within the last 10 to 15 years Paul's solo efforts have been spiraling downward (his last decent solo record being Tug of War).  But with his personal trauma of recent years, I felt he deserved yet another chance to rebound from heartache and use it to give his music a much needed boost of passion and depth but now I honestly think he has reached rock bottom.  Being a loyal and die-hard Beatles (and Wings) fan for a great many years, I found it very difficult to not like this album.  However, repeated listens have only reinforced my contempt for Driving Rain.  He sounds a bit tired and his songs suffer from bland arrangements and ordinary song craftmanship.  Very few musical &quot;hooks&quot; which have been his staple all these years.  However one thing is persistent and that is his trite lyrics.  &quot;1-2-3-4-5, let's go for a drive&quot; (sigh).  Listening and reading the lyrics to Spinning on an Axis, Rinse the Raindrops and Tiny Bubble just to name a few, made me cringe.  Even as disappointing as his obvious lack in lyrical ability is that doesn't really bother me so much because his musical craftmanship has always balanced his other shortcomings.  But now it seems he has lost his creative musical spark as well. With the exception of &quot;Your Way&quot; and &quot;From a Lover to a Friend&quot;<BR>which offer a touch of melody that Paul is largely known for, the rest of this music comes across as spectacularly bland and unimpressive. Because of his past greatness, Paul McCartney will probably always have my ear.  However, I'm finding myself less and less interested in what he has to say musically or otherwise.
B00005JCA9|5.0|This is one of the cutes and funiest movie I have ever watched.<BR>I have look at it about 10 time.<BR>So much romance and so much fun. Hug Grand is just perfect in that role so is Julia.<br />And for thoses who do not know him yet you will discover the funyest &quot;thing&quot;, and yes it is a human beeing, that have ever walked on this planet.
B00005QK3W|2.0|As much as it hurts to say this, I'm afraid Paul is beginning to dry up.  I purchased this CD knowing full well that Paul's solo efforts have been declining rapidly over the last ten to fifteen years (Tug of War being his last decent solo record in my opinion).  Even still, I figured he deserved another chance. With his recent personal trauma, I assumed he was capable of digging deep and releasing a great record.  Unfortunately, I don't hear an original or a unique sound.  Song after song contains a bland musical direction coupled with trite lyrics.  A couple songs start out well including &quot;From a Lover to a Friend&quot; and &quot;Your Way&quot; but that doesn't make a good album.  His lyrics sound silly on the title track, Spinning on an Axis, Rinse the Raindrops among many others.  I have to admit I tried very very hard to like this album.  I have been a die-hard Beatles and Wings fan for many years and he still has my ear out of respect to a past greatness.  However I'm finding myself less and less interested in hearing what Paul McCartney has to say lyrically and musically.
B00004TWZF|5.0|Best pictures, best actors, best music. BEST FILM!!<br />One of the best movie I  have ever watched.<br />Must be owned. If you have never seen this movie, this is a Luc Besson movie, better then the 5th element, with romance, uncredible pictures from Greece, Italy, France, so much romance and friendship...<BR>perfect
B00000BKE1|4.0|It seems that Fear Of The Dark is known as one of Maiden's weakest album, and for good reasons. one of the bad things on the album is Bruce's voice. Bruce's voice sounds quite different on this album, more &quot;husky&quot; and less powerful, which is a bad thing. just listen to Maiden's previous albums which there his voice sounds powerfully amazing, and then listen to his voice on this album and you'll be shocked with the difference. another bad thing this album has to offer is that the guitars are overall less powerful. another bad thing is that this album has lots of fillers. But enough with the bad things, this album has lots of good things too. First of all, this album has one of Nicko's best drumming performers. this album also has Maiden's classics, like &quot;be Quick Or Be Dead&quot;, &quot;From Here To Eternity&quot;, &quot;Afraid To Shoot Strangers&quot;, the great ballad &quot;Wasting Love&quot; and Maiden's most famous song ever - &quot;Fear Of The Dark&quot;. &quot;Fear Of The Dark&quot;, the song itself, is Maiden's best live song also. so overall it's a decent album, one of Maiden's least best, and i didn't know if i should give this album 3 stars rating or 4 but i went on 4 cause Iron Maiden rulez!! oh by the way, what would you say about the art cover of the album? amazing art cover!!!
B00005AAFS|5.0|&quot;Crushing&quot;,is a mild understatement. This is an industrial masterpiece. Every track is just...well,great! I really despise nu-metal and in my opinion,it's ruined music. These guys aren't nu-metal. They actually kick serious ass. Heavy,melodic keys and more toned-down lyrics. It's great,get it.
B000002LEM|3.0|This album sounds like it was written while at some beach resort in Mexico or SoCal.  There must be some connection between 1984, 5150, and 0U812 all being number titles, and that they feature keyboards prominently.  As Sammy proved his pipes VH worthy on 5150, the band settled into a noticeably more mature and reflective mood than on previous releases.  Ed was able to tap into a different kind of songwriting here than he ever could with the superficiality of Roth.<br />The uptempo keyboard laced, &quot;Mine All Mine&quot;, espouses a religious skepticism, while encouraging you to &quot;Be your own best friend&quot;.  Although ambivalent towards it, Sammy reveals an obvious religiosity as would become more apparent on &quot;Judgement Day&quot; (Carnal Knowledge), and on &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;, (Balance).  Musically however, &quot;Mine All Mine&quot;, doesn't work very well.  VH scores another tremendous power ballad with, &quot;When It's Love&quot;, which is a worthy successor to 5150's, &quot;Love Walks In&quot;, and, &quot;Dreams&quot;.  &quot;A.F.U. (Naturally Wired)&quot;, is Ed's take on what keeps him fired up for a world tour.  It sorta rocks, but suffers from noodly guitar, and excess screaming.  &quot;Cabo Wabo&quot;, is the band leading the successful rock star life with plenty of time and money for a leisurely, chic-filled existence at the beach.  Good dynamics through 7 minutes make for an enjoyable song.  The first time I heard &quot;Source Of Infection&quot;, I immediately thought, &quot;Ed's rehashing some old riffs on this one/must be running out of ideas.&quot;  It's among the worst song's VH has done.<br />&quot;Feels So Good&quot;, is a good keyboard-based, mellow rocker to listen to at the beach.  On the country flavored, &quot;Finish What Ya Started&quot;, Sammy's pleading and Ed's twangy picking make for a foot-tappin' good song.  &quot;Black And Blue&quot;, steps into the bedroom with it's Prince-like sex imagry.  It's steady blues beatis it's appeal.  The opening to &quot;Sucker In 3 Piece&quot;, features Ed's best guitar playing of the album.  It's a rocker about Sammy's frustration over the hot chick who chooses the rich conservative business man over his more bohemian, unpretentious personality.  Most guys can relate to that.  It truthfully expresses a common envy of men, but essentially says, &quot;screw you&quot;, to those golddiggers who would rather be a trophy wife for a sell out than go for someone more deep and real.  &quot;A Apolitical Blues&quot; affirms VH's loyalty to spirit over politics.  A boring song though.<br />While it is a deeper and mellower effort than anything they'd done previously, on the whole it is among their weakest albums.  Ed's guitar playing is probably at it's least impressive here, but still, Van Halen's worst is a cut above the usual.  &quot;When It's Love&quot;, easily qualifies as essential Van Halen.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus can do no wrong! Another INCREDIBLE album from Incubus!
B0000026UL|5.0|The 80's were not a kind time for Bob Dylan. Maybe it was writer's block or just what was going on musically but he made his worst albums during the 80's expect in 1989 when he released &quot;Oh Mercy,&quot; which made that dismal period for Dylan worthwhile. &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; is definitely a transition and landmark album in the Bob Dylan catalogue. You can see the early workings of Dylan's attitude on &quot;Time Out Of Mind&quot; and &quot;Love and Theft&quot; at play here. The lyrics are personal and heartbreaking, even nihilistic at times. Musically, the album is very return to form. It is acoustic guitar and low-key piano and harmonica. The highlight songs for me are: &quot;Where Teardrops Fall&quot;, &quot;Ring Them Bells&quot;, &quot;Most Of The Time&quot;(Maybe the best song on the album), &quot;What Was It You Wanted,&quot; and &quot;Shooting Star.&quot; &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; defintely would make it on my list of top favorite Dylan albums. This is a must.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|I have to admit that when I saw this in the theater I was tempted to walk out after the first five minutes (after the overture) because I couldn't stand the editing and acting style.  But I was soon swept in.  Either you love it or you hate it.  I ended up loving it.  People who only see it as part of Luhrman's trilogy are missing something--  he not only steals sets and ideas from his Boheme production, he also steals plot details from Camille/La Dame aux Camelias/La Traviata.  But I don't mind such plagiarism since the method is so original.  I think he is stealing from a higher level than most of his audience realizes.<br />My only complaint is that the DVD edition is poorly organized and labeled.  It is almost impossible to find what you want.  Don't give up.  Give yourself time.  You will probably end up loving it.
6302787300|5.0|I enjoyed this movie more than Scott's oscar winning epic pic &quot;Gladiator&quot;. What happens to be most impressive about &quot;1492 - the conquest of paradise&quot; is the films natural elements and how incredibly real they feel to the viewer. Example, the scene of discovery, three ships bearing down on a than unknown land is curiously titillating and seems oddly familiar. In a word, that scene stands remarkably true to life, and perhaps, is one of the best historical scenes ever put on film. 1492's technical aspects (everything from camera work, acting, to costume designs) convey a sharp sense of sophistication. <br />Much should be credited to Scott and everyone involved in this project, for creating a highly skilled, intelligent, artful account of historical significance. &quot;1492 - the conquest of paradise&quot; is a very rare gem of cinematic history, because it feels completely natural, totally real, and to us the viewer, we wind up feeling like we had just lived moments of a man's life. That man, Christopher Columbus.
B00003CXAA|3.0|I have loved the GODFATHER SAGA from the beginning.  When the DVD version came out, I even purchased a DVD in order to watch it.  The cinematography of the DVD version is perfect.  HOWEVER my biggest and only gripe is... why did they put the extra parts on a separate CD.. why didnt they incorporate them in the movie???? That made no sense.  I have the VHS chronological version with out the cut scenes.. I was hoping the DVD version would have incorporated them...as much as this thing costs... would that have been a problem???WHY.. now do I have to spend another 100 bucks for the edited snippets to be incorporated??? WHY?

0385505833|2.0|Having read most of Grisham's other books , and enjoying most I jumped at the chance to read his latest as an escape from the hustle of the holidays.  I should have skipped , &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;. This was certainly not his best venture. I almost wonder if he even wrote it!  By its pure brevity I knew there wouldn't be much there  as far as plot, but thought it might be inspiring like, &quot;The Christmas Box&quot; of past years.  It was so predictable and sterotypical.  It might just make it as a script for a Chevy Chase movie--the part when Mr. Krank falls off the roof-- oh, wait a minute ,that's already been done!  I almost wonder why he wasted his time on this.  Surely he doesn't need the money and I wouldn't waste yours.
B00003CXXS|4.0|Of all three JP movies, I think JP3 just might be the one I'll be watching most often. The first movie was really good, but after countless times watching it I've found myself tiring of the first half, waiting impatiently for the dinosaurs to break loose. The Lost World was also good, yet slightly flawed somehow. This third installment gives the viewer the most bang for their buck. Not only does it feature the best dinosaur effects as of yet, the action pieces are also inventive and memorable. You've got the infamous T-Rex vs. Spinosaurus smackdown, Billy's parasail rescue in the aviary, and the confrontation with the Spinosaurus yet again in the river. True, the script is lacking in some areas (Amanda Kirby doesn't react to the death of her b/f when they find his corpse) and cliched in other parts (Billy, the over-eager assistant), but the actors and actresses bring their characters to life, and make the movie compelling.<br />Universal has done a great job with this DVD. The audio is fantastic. I've heard the picture suffers from edge enhancement or whatever, but since I don't have a widescreen TV, the picture looks great to me. The supplements are what make the disc, though. While a lot of the supplements look superficial and promotional, they offer a lot more depth than one might expect. Don't expect an hour-long documentary ala Star Wars Episode One, but the half-hour behind-the-scenes program is better than the usual ten-minute peek Universal's past DVD's have offered. What really makes these supplements worthwhile is that they enhanced my perception of the flick. From the commentary track to the mini featurettes, you really get the feeling that all who were involved had a fantastic time making Jurassic Park III. That's rare, especially when making a sequel that the public really didn't expect much from. JPIII did not come from a third-rate, inexperienced director or a bunch of actors lured back to the franchise with $$$. Watch the movie, then go through all the special features, and you'll see JPIII in a whole new light.<br />This is a really great disc for a great movie which proves the JP franchise hasn't quite gone extinct yet.

B00005OM4N|4.0|Fine, there's no point in denying the truth: Part of what makes me a big fan of Britney Spears is videos like &quot;I'm a Slave 4 You.&quot; Is that really so bad? (Actually, don't answer that). The point is, this is a really good CD. Pop music was never meant to stay around for decades. Only a few, such as Michael Jackson, the Beatles, etc. have been so lucky. I don't doubt that in another decade or so, Britney will probably be one of countless other stars left the dust. But until them, I'm going to enjoy the ride; as long as Britney keeps em coming, I'll keep buying.<br />Unlike the two previous CD's, &quot;Britney&quot; seems to have a better ratio of listenable songs to filler material. The first three tracks rock. The fourth track, I believe, is the obligatory love song. It's not bad, it's just not up my alley. Then we come to the controversial track five, &quot;Boys&quot;. Worse things have been sung by other artists. Unless you're deeply offended by the lyrics, this is another catchy tune. Tracks seven and eight round out my immediate favorites. The CD is also enhanced with a video performance of &quot;Overprotected&quot; and clips from Britney's new movie. I'm not sure how good the movie will be, but it's a nice bonus to the disc. The booklet also contains a mini fold-out poster, which again promotes the movie on its flipside.<br />My only complaint? Only one set of lyrics is listed in the booklet. I'm guessing this is a song Britney wrote herself. Well she can highlight it in bold and print it in rainbow colors for all I care, I want more lyrics!<br />If you're one of those people devoted to hating Britney Spears, this CD won't change your minds. If you're sitting on the fence, go ahead and buy it, you'll be pleasantly surprised. And if you are a fan, what are you waiting for?! Get it now! Britney's 15 minutes aren't up anytime soon!!
B00005QZ7U|1.0|A few years ago, Ewan McGregor appeared in a critically acclaimed film called &quot;Little Voice&quot;.  Surprisingly, the title did not refer to him.  Little Voice was the name of the film's very shy, soft-spoken star, who when inspired could imitate the great divas (eg, Judy Garland.)  In Little Voice, Ewan did not sing.  After sitting through Moulin Rouge, I can understand why.  Ewan, though one of the best actors of our time, cannot sing.<br />That said, it is obvious what the biggest problem is with Moulin Rouge.  Although Director Baz Luhrmann creates one of the most colorful, original movies in years, he fails to recognize that musicals need singers.  Moulin Rouge has great musical arrangements, a great choice of diverse music, and cleverly moves from one selection to another.  However, all of this is marred when Ewan, co-star Nicole, or any of the other cast members open their mouths.  None of them can sing.  They are downright awful.  The only decent voice in this film is ... The MOON.  (In one of the film's cutest moments, The Moon begans to sing opera in the background.)<br />Speaking of little voices, Nicole Kidman has the tiniest voice I have ever heard.  Though an accomplished actress, Nicole only inspires laughter when she tries to lead songs in this movie.  And as beautiful as she looks, Nicole also oversteps her bounds by trying to do one of Marilyn Monroe's signature numbers, Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend.  Though Nicole's version has more dancers, more extras, more orchestra, more whatever, it doesn't have Monroe's ebullience, sex appeal or, for that matter, her voice.<br />As we watched the DVD, we kept laughing at Ewan's howls, Nicole's whispers, and at the other vocally-challenged cast members.  When it was over, all we could say was, &quot;What were they thinking?&quot;

B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is truly a sad time for music.  Many of my favorite musicians seem to be passing away.  Perhaps the most jarring of them all was the recent death of guitarist George Harrison.  The second of the Fab Four to leave this world.  Upon hearing that, I had to break out this album and listen to all 78 minutes.  It almost made me cry.  The Beatles were such an amazing band, I can't even explain it.  Their music was simple, and there wasn't really much to them, and yet somehow they had this charisma and vitality that just outweighed all that.  The nearest comparison I can draw is Nirvana.  Nirvana took the world by storm in the early 90's, much the same way as the Beatles did some 30 years before.  The music wasn't very technical, and the lyrics didn't make much sense (just like the Beatles), and yet they were loved and revered, and their songs just made you feel good.  And, of course, Kurt died a tragic death, much as John Lennon did some back in 1980.  And now, whenever I listen to either of these bands, I'm reminded of the deaths of these great musicians, and the amazing talent that was taken away from us.  For the Beatles, that has doubled now that George has gone.  <br />This is an excellent collection, with every number one hit the Beatles ever had.  It's not a greatest hits package, so obviously there are a lot of great songs missing.  The cool thing is that all these songs are arranged chronologically, so you can sort of see the evolution of the band, going from a poppish boy band type thing to the more spiritual side of the later stuff.  It's great listening, and every fan of rock and roll should own this.  Rest in peace George and John, we will miss you for many years to come.
0553502077|5.0|I didn't read the other reviews before giving my own impression, but I give this audio novel 5 stars because of the narrator, who is absolutely nothing short of an amazing story-reader.  He does uncanny impersonations of the characters' voices, and has a pleasant, balanced voice that never tires out or overwhelms you.<br />The story itself, although not as compelling as The Firm for instance, is still decent enough, considering the first-rate narration.  I listened to this audio book on a long two-day car drive and certainly felt what the critics call &quot;riveted.&quot;  I won't give away the ending, but it's a great one!
B0000542DJ|5.0|Oliver Stone's &quot;JFK&quot; is a remarkable film that is too often overshadowed by the very real events upon which it is based and by the perceived political agenda of its director. But, as Stone himself has stated on numerous occasions, the movie is not meant to stand as a definitive historical document but rather as an alternative look at what might have happened on that fateful day in Dallas given the conflicting and incomplete information that came out of the official final word on President Kennedy's assassination, The Warren Commission Report. Much of &quot;JFK&quot; is based on known fact but Stone has taken it one step further and extrapolated out a variety of possible realities based on the many unanswered questions and perplexing coincidences that surround the case.<br /><br />The central character in the film is Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), the district attorney from New Orleans who actually brought the case of the Kennedy assassination to court -- some three years after the fact. Although his attempt to convict Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) of conspiracy in the assassination of the president was doomed to failure, the facts that he uncovered, and continued to pursue through his later writings on the subject, gave a certain legitimacy to the claims by conspiracy theorists that all was not right with the official investigation. Through countless scenes, the government's assertion that Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) was in fact a lone gunman who acted of his own volition and with no outside help is continuously under siege. By the end of the film, every preconceived notion that the viewer may have had regarding the assassination has been called into question.<br /><br />In addition to the actors mentioned above, &quot;JFK&quot; is a virtual who's-who of Hollywood talent. Rounding out the cast are Kevin Bacon, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, and even John Candy. In all instances, the performers bring a certain degree of mystery to their roles that really reinforces the overall disconcerting feel of the film.<br />Enough about the film already, what about the DVD? Well, as many of you know, Warner first released &quot;JFK&quot; as a movie-only edition back in 1997. While this DVD featured Oliver Stone's preferred director's cut of the movie with some 17 additional minutes of footage reinserted, the video was non-anamorphic and the audio was a merely serviceable DD 2.0 mix. In addition, the lack of any extras was a shame and the disc itself was a dreaded &quot;flipper&quot;. With this new release, Warner has addressed all of these issues and &quot;JFK&quot; is at long last available in a fine special edition DVD.<br /><br />&quot;JFK&quot; is presented in anamorphic widescreen, preserving the 2.35:1 aspect ratio of the original theatrical release. Sharpness is usually quite solid although the extensive use of filters lends a somewhat soft appearance to the image in a number of scenes. Black levels and contrast are good with only the darkest of scenes losing fine shadow detail. Colors are accurate and exhibit no signs of bleeding but the palette is, for the most part, somewhat muted. I could spot no instances of compression artifacts and the edge enhancement that plagued the original release is mercifully gone. The video is a marked improvement over the old release and, while it isn't a perfect transfer, I could find no glaring issues with the work Warner has done preparing this release.<br /><br />Just as the video has been upgraded for the new special edition, so too has the audio. Replacing the fairly good Dolby Digital 2.0 mix on the previous release is a brand-new 5.1 channel Dolby Digital soundtrack available in both English and French. The increase in dynamic range afforded by this new mix really makes John Williams's moving score come alive and adds some overall depth to the soundtrack as a whole. Surround use is frequent and well-integrated and dialogue is always clearand firmly anchored to the center. While this new 5.1 mix certainly won't give the best soundtracks a run for their money, it is a fair improvement over the previous release and is very well done.<br />Now we come to that facet of DVD that truly defines a special edition -- the extras. Seeing as how the film itself is quite long, Warner has taken the step of making &quot;JFK&quot; into a two-disc release in order to accommodate the plentiful bonus features.<br /><br />Disc One features the movie itself and provides a very engaging commentary track by Oliver Stone. I've listened to a number of his commentaries and they are always informative, entertaining, and full of great personal and professional recollections. &quot;JFK&quot; is no exception as the director delves into every facet of this remarkable film. His tone is always conversational which makes the three plus hours spent listening to him more enjoyable than one might expect. Rounding out the extras on Disc One are cast and crew bios and filmographies as well as a list of the awards that &quot;JFK&quot; has garnered.<br /><br />Disc Two is where the real strength of this special edition resides. First up is a 15 minute interview entitled &quot;Meet Mr. X: The Personality and Thoughts of Fletcher Prouty&quot; in which the real-life Mr. X discusses his particular take on the assassination. Played by Donald Sutherland in the movie, Mr. X was to Jim Garrison as Deep Throat was to Bob Woodward -- a shadowy source who provides the hints needed to further the investigation. Next up is &quot;Assassination Update: The New Documents,&quot; a 30 minute multimedia essay hosted by noted conspiracy theorist James DiEugenio. Combining text, photographs, and video clips, Mr. DiEugenio delivers a very riveting, if not a bit overwhelming and scattershot, look at the facts of the case that have come to light in recent years.<br /><br />Are we done yet? Not even close. Also included on Disc Two is 50 minutes of additional footage that can be viewed individually or as a complete set and with or without Oliver Stone's accompanying commentary. Combine this with the 17 minutes previously added back into the film and you have well over an hour of footage that wasn't in the original theatrical release. As is the case with some of the scenes that were added to the director's cut, much of this bonus material is redundant. Nevertheless, there are some real gems here and it's great that this abundance of cutting room casualties are included on the DVD.<br />Rounding out the extras on Disc Two is the DVD-ROM content that features links to a number of websites, a series of theatrical trailers for this and other Oliver Stone films, print reviews of &quot;JFK,&quot; and a link for a future online chat with Oliver Stone. Whew!<br /><br />Now we turn to an aspect of this DVD that I rarely mention in a review -- the packaging. &quot;JFK&quot; is presented in Warner's preferred snapper case, which should come as no surprise. But, in order to accommodate the two discs, a pocket has been added to the cover flap and Disc Two resides there in a flimsy little envelope. It really is a screwy method that may be a bit rough on that second disc over the long haul so it's best that the buyer be forewarned. But, on the plus side, Warner has taken the negative comments about this packaging to heart and have promised to come up with a better alternative for any future two disc sets.<br /><br />&quot;JFK&quot; is a thought-provoking film that remains almost as big a conundrum as the subject upon which it is based. Many viewers and critics see it as nothing more than another political rant by that crazy Ollie Stone.

Combine this with the 17 minutes previously added back into the film and you have well over an hour of footage that wasn't in the original theatrical release. As is the case with some of the scenes that were added to the director's cut, much of this bonus material is redundant. Nevertheless, there are some real gems here and it's great that this abundance of cutting room casualties are included on the DVD.<br />Rounding out the extras on Disc Two is the DVD-ROM content that features links to a number of websites, a series of theatrical trailers for this and other Oliver Stone films, print reviews of &quot;JFK,&quot; and a link for a future online chat with Oliver Stone. Whew!<BR>  <BR>Now we turn to an aspect of this DVD that I rarely mention in a review -- the packaging. &quot;JFK&quot; is presented in Warner's preferred snapper case, which should come as no surprise. But, in order to accommodate the two discs, a pocket has been added to the cover flap and Disc Two resides there in a flimsy little envelope. It really is a screwy method that may be a bit rough on that second disc over the long haul so it's best that the buyer be forewarned. But, on the plus side, Warner has taken the negative comments about this packaging to heart and have promised to come up with a better alternative for any future two disc sets.<BR>  <BR>&quot;JFK&quot; is a thought-provoking film that remains almost as big a conundrum as the subject upon which it is based.

B00005QK3W|4.0|Paul McCartney is all of a sudden on a hot streak with three fine albums in a row. While not as strong as 1997's classic \\"Flaming Pie\\"; this is certainly a worthy addition to the Mac catalogue. The craftsmanship of the song writing is some of the best we have seen from Paul in years. It is masterfully produced by David Kahne. The basic McCartney melodicism is there as usual but with a little more of an edge. Vocally, he is giving us more of a rock feel like he did on Run Devil Run. He gives us this wonderful Little Richard screech at times as well as his sweet, beautiful voice on ballads. There are a lot of different feels, images and sounds going on here in a potpourri; but it is all brought together in a very cohesive way. I liked this album a lot and it gets better with repeated listenings.
0783226063|5.0|This movie is one that coerces you to use your mind and think. Having read Frank Herbert's Dune novels and being quite a fan of the movie, I was expecting a good time when I watched this DVD. What I got was an extraordinary time. The sound of the movie is fantastic. This is from the battle sequences, the musical score written by Toto to the mind-boggling scenery and extraordinary visuals on the screen. Even though the story may be hard to follow, almost all of it is taken from Herbert's first book, &quot;Dune.&quot; Most of the movie Dune is effects laden and is very enjoyable. There are some great creatures created by Carlo Rambaldi. There are a large number of characters and a lot of big name actors on the bill. This sights and sounds on this DVD will astound you.  Note : I saw the Region 1 DVD Version a year and a half ago in India, and it blew me away. The version available in the US is exactly the same.<br />Look &amp; Listen:<br />The video transfer of the movie is quite good. Although not an anamorphic transfer, the quality of the picture is great. The unbelievable sets used are a wonder to behold. This movie has some very good looking shots in it. There are very few artifacts noticeable on the screen. Even though the movie is full of the color black and tan, the blue of the eyes of the Fremen stands out and looks beautiful. Certain reds jump off the screen. The special effects change the color of the sky from its usual light blue to the omnipresent tan.<br />The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound of this movie is absolutely wonderful. The voices are easily understandable and the music has a good ambient feel. When Paul uses &quot;the Voice,&quot; the echo is very clear and understandable. In the battle scenes, the sound really is fantastic and engulfs the listener. You almost feel as if you are one of the Fremen following Paul Atreides in his quest to become the Kwisatz Haderach. The surround sound is fabulous and gave my home theater system a good workout.<br />Extras &amp; Highlights:<br />The special features on the DVD are limited. There is the original motion picture trailer for the movie. The production notes are very complete and are ten menus in length, with different still photos in the background. There are cast and crew biographies and filmographies of certain characters in the movie.<br />Menus &amp; Interface:<br />The menus are static pictures. The scene selection menus are very easy to use. With only 16 chapters on the DVD, it's quite difficult to find a specific spot in the movie without using your remote. Still, they are very functional and easy to navigate. There are different still photos from the movie used on the menus.<br />Storyline &amp; Syllabus:<br />Be forewarned! It is the year 10191 A.D. This is the story of Paul Atreides (McLachlan), son of Duke Leto Atreides (Proctnow) and Lady Jessica (Annis), a former Bene Gesserit nun. The Padashah Emperor Shaddam IV (Ferrer) has ordered House Atreides to go to the planet Arrakis. The planet Arrakis is also known as Dune. This is where House Atreides fights their mortal enemies, the House Harkonnen. House Harkonnen is led by the Vladimir Harkonnen (Williams), Feyd Rautha (Sting), and Piter DeVries (Dourif), the Mentat. House Atreides are also on Arrakis to mine spice, the life blood of the universe. Paul falls in love with Chani (Young), the daughter of Dr. Kynes (Von Sydow), the Imperial Biologist. This is Paul's story, mainly. You will enjoy as the transformation from the young man Paul Atreides into the honored Paul Muad'dib, eventually maturing into the Kwisatz Haderach, which is the hand of God.<br />Cast &amp; Crew:<br />The movie Dune stars Kyle McLachlan, Jose Ferrer, Max Von Sydow, Linda Hunt, Francesca Annis, Sting, Dean Stockwell, Sean Young, J&uuml;rgen Proctnow, Kenneth Williams and Patrick Stewart. The movie was directed by David Lynch. The movie was produced by Raffaella DeLaurentiis. The screenplay was written by David Lynch based on the novel Dune, written by Frank Herbert. Most of the movie Dune is effects laden and is very enjoyable. There are some great creatures created by Carlo Rambaldi and the director of photography is Freddy Francis. The musical score was written by Toto and the Prophecy Theme was written by Brian Eno.<br />Conclusions &amp; Afterthoughts:<br />A movie of such magnitude is very tough to follow. Based on the novel by Frank Herbert, it's not necessary to read the book but it certainly helps. There is a lot of the story line that you may lose in the movie, unless you already know the story. Certain characters aren't as well developed as others, making it tough to follow certain characters. Reading the book allows you to also learn the terminology of the movie, too. Director David Lynch does his best to explain the back story, which is very large. Most of the movie could roll along at a slow pace for the person who isn't familiar to the surroundings of Dune. For those who are familiar with the book, the movie may be a disappointment.<br />Dune was always considered a tough movie to make. Aside from the multifaceted plot to the gigantic sets, the movie also looks brilliant on the small screen. This DVD sounds wonderful and the picture isn't that bad of a transfer. This movie is an aural and visual delight. Made in 1984, this movie has some brilliant special effects for that time period. This is before most computer generated effects, too, and that makes the movie even more stunning. If you like the look of special effects in the mid-1980's, this movie is definitely for you.<br />The movie Dune was re-edited and released as a four hour television special. Director Lynch asked that his name be removed from that version. This is not that version. The additional length helped character development and the story, but Lynch and Universal had creative differences. This problem and others resulted in that version credited to Director Alan Smithee. Certain people prefer that version, but it's not available on DVD. The original is, and I'm very pleased that I watched it. Bring on the pastry!ne, written by Frank Herbert.

B00005JKQX|5.0|A gripping and moving view into the world of the mind and heart.  Russell Crowe is magnificent in portraying the arrogance of genius, the despair of helplessness of mental illness and the strength of will to overcome both.  Jennifer Connelly is a wonderful revelation and all the supporting roles are perfect.  This film kept two audiences spellbound throughout the film and it was nice not to be the only one shedding a tear.  Oscars to all involved, including Ron Howard for his daring choices, James Horner for the score and the unknown (to me) genius who did Crowe's makeup in the later scenes.
B00004RFFS|5.0|Visually and atmospherically, &quot;Interview With The Vampire&quot; is a beautiful film and it is great to see that this DVD from Warner Home Video is bringing the film to life like never before. In a direct comparison to the 1997 DVD release of the film - it was one of the first DVDs in the market, actually - it becomes obvious that technology has made big strides. While the image quality of the original release was outstanding at the time, the new transfer exhibits a notably higher definition. Although the master from which this DVD has been created appears to be the same that was used for the DVD release three years ago, the film looks remarkably better on this DVD. The movie is presented in a 16x9 enhanced widescreen presentation in a 1.78:1 widescreen aspect ratio.<br /><br />The color reproduction is more faithful to the film's original presentation without any signs of discoloration. The level of detail is incredible and edges are sharply defined without the signs of edge-enhancement that were evident in the earlier release. Blacks are deep and always maintain enough detail without breaking up. The highlights are beautifully rendered while contrasts are perfectly balanced, restoring all of Jordan's ominously dark and atmospheric imagery. Color reproduction is very faithful with strong hues and tones, never bleeding, and free of noise. The compression of the movie is virtually flawless without any signs of compression artifacts in the presentation, leaving all the details, and colors fully intact. Interestingly however, the menus found on this disc, are riddled with compression artifacts like pixelation and banding, which is quite surprising given the overall stellar presentation of the movie itself.<br /><br />The disc contains 5.1 channel Dolby Digital audio tracks in English and French as well as an English DTS audio track. Just as in the video department, Warner Home Video brings out some spectacular quality in the movie's audio presentation. The Dolby Digital track is beautifully an engaging without the slightest signs of noise or distortion. With its good use of the surrounds, the track exhibits a beautiful spatial integration and flawless imaging. Even the subtlest ambient effects are evident in the presentation, adding to the haunting beauty of the film. A good bass extension adds to the movie's visceral punch, which helps giving some of the more dramatic action scenes the necessary impact.<br />The DTS track that can be found on the disc is equally impressive and actually manages to outperform the Dolby Digital mix on a number of occasions. The dynamics of the track, the clarity and natural reproduction of the score is simply breathtaking. The spatial integration creates a sound image that is extremely lively and boasts of the most subtle sonic nuances and timbres. Dialogues are well integrated in all versions and always understandable.<br /><br />Director Neil Jordan has also contributed a commentary track to this release, which is very engaging and full of valuable information. Jordan covers a plethora of aspects surrounding the production of the movie. Without notable pauses, Jordan easily coves the entire 2 hours of the movie's running length and manages to remain interesting, entertaining and informative over the entire course. You will walk away from this commentary with a new-found appreciation for the movie and the people involved. The faithfulness and efforts that went into making this the atmospheric film it ultimately is, is impressive and full of exciting tidbits.<br /><br />When starting up &quot;Interview With The Vampire&quot; a 1-minute introduction will greet you, which helps to set the right mood and expectations for the film. The introduction can also be found in the disc's &quot;Special Features&quot; section where you will also find &quot;In The Shadow Of The Vampire,&quot; a new 30-minute documentary featuring interesting interviews with Anne rice, director Neil Jordan, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas, Stan Winston and many others. Not only does it cover different aspects of the movie and the novels themselves, but also the peripheral area of vampirism in general. It is a great piece that you shouldn't miss to watch. The disc also contains the movie's theatrical trailer and a link to a special feature on Warner's website, called &quot;History Of The Vampire.&quot;<br />Warner Home Video has prepared a spectacular package for &quot;Interview With The Vampire&quot; with this DVD. Given the quality of all the content it is surprising Warner managed to squeeze four audio tracks in top notch quality on the disc, together with a beautiful anamorphic transfer and even supplements like the documentary. All in all, this DVD turns out to be an incarnation of the movie like you have never experienced it, so don't miss out on this one.sten Dunst, Antonio Banderas, Stan Winston and many others.

B00005QDW5|4.0|I have read pretty much all the wide range of reviews on here before I picked up this album. But I must Say I am impressed with the selections. Sure there are songs that were left out(Welcome to the Machine, Mother, Etc.)...But the Album is trying to give a taste of all the Era's of Floyd. I here people complaining over and over again about the inclusion of the newer Pink Floyd material from Division Bell, Momentary Lapse of Reason and such but I actually like these albums and felt they should be represented. Now I have only come across Floyd in the past 10 years so I am biased toward the newer stuff-  The Dave Gilmour Era as I call it...and I understand for some die-harders that Floyd will either truly be to them a Syd Barrett Era Group, or a Roger Waters Era Group and that is fine. Because this collection will give you a taste of all three eras. So you can decide what You like. Don't believe some of these people on here who say the new stuff sucks, or old stuff sucks or whatever. Make-Up your own mind...And this collection is a good place start into the Realm of Floyd.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Hey, from all the talk in the other reviews, it seems as though I should be dissappointed with &quot;Echoes&quot;.  As an album in itself it's great.  It's an extremely well mastered blend of some really great Floyd tunes.  As a concept, it has fallen short.  Missing here is Obscured by Clouds (one of my favorite albums), Brain Damage (my favorite Pink Floyd song), and at least a whole other disc's worth of songs.  I would have taken the disc number up from 2 to 4.  I understand that &quot;echoes&quot;(the song) is 23 minutes long, but cutting the TITLE TRACK of an album 7 minutes is rather foolish.  I regret that they didn't do a better job than they could have on this album.  A 3rd and 4th disc would have given them plenty of room for uncut Echoes, more songs from Animals, The Wall, and would have given a much better place to the Final Cut.  I could honestly care less about the Post-Waters era music.  <BR>In general:<BR>For listening it's great; but if you want to get a true feel for Floyd, collect the albums (especially the completely omitted Obscured By Clouds and More).

0345413377|1.0|The series began well inviting me into a world of intrigue and fantasy, always dangling a new question ahead, tempting one further down the path.  Unfortunately the final volumne, The Amber Spyglass, rattles and clunks it's way downward losing parts and pieces along the road of  fantasy as if the author had created such just to bring one to a rude awakening.  It arrives naked at it's final destination stripped bare of any redeeming plot or even the pretense of assuming one. It is unendurable as the book becomes a pulpit from which the author delivers his own accumulated personal payload of adolescent bile and political/religious babble. One can hear him saying \\"Forget the book, now that I have you this far, this is what I really wanted to say.\\"  It's like watching the window roll down as the car rolls to a stop and the gentleman inside does his sweetly perverted best to lure  children within reach of his dark and subtle grasp.  This isn't a children's fantasy trilogy. It's literary molestation.

I liked Enigma's first two albums better than the later ones - the last two albums were kind of silly, I thought.  Here, I found that the later songs sounded much better blended in with the earlier ones - I enjoyed them more here than on the later albums themselves.  I guess the whole here is greater than the sum of its parts.  Overall this is a very enjoyable collection.
0553712837|5.0|What a fun read for the holidays!  Prior to reading &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; I was a true Grisham fan, but now even more so.  I really enjoyed taking a break from the serious side of his writing to this light hearted book that had me laughing out loud. Since reading this book, I have noticed that there are huge &quot;Frosties&quot; in several front yards in my neighborhood, and I have developed a new appreciation for &quot;smoked trout&quot;. This would be a wonderful Christmas T.V. movie.  Please keep up the great work Mr. Grisham, and Merry Christmas!
B00005QDW5|5.0|This collection contains songs from EVERY Pink Floyd album and really charts their career from '60's with Syd to the bleak Water's years in the '80's and all they way through 'Division Bell'.<br />As a fan only since The Wall in '79, and only having their albums from '73 and later, it was great to hear their early singles from the '60's.  Their sound then was very '60's psychadelic and melodic, not at all like their sound-effects-driven concept albums later on.  There are at least half a dozen of these old singles here, which I'd never heard before.  If you are a long-time Pink Floyd fan, then this is for you - it's all here.  If you only like later Pink Floyd, then their early work is a wonderful discovery.<br />One note:  the label promises &quot;mixed by the band as a continuous experience&quot;, but that doesn't mean there is lots of added orchestration bridging the songs.  Quite the opposite.  Only a few small bits were added to make the songs blend a little better, that's all.  That's enough, too.  So don't expect a lot of new sounds around your old favorites - you'll be disappointed if you do.
B00005JKQX|5.0|It is a rare picture that brings together superb acting (both lead and supporting cast), writing, directing and editing.  A Beautiful Mind does all that and is a must-see, a wonderful film that will surely give Russell Crowe an Oscar nomination, if not a win.  One of the year's best. Don't miss it.
6304711883|4.0|One of the factors that keeps &quot;Ransom&quot; from being a great movie, as opposed to a good one, is that we know too much in the beginning about who's behind the crime at the center of the story. In effect, this tactic also works in the movie's favor, providing it the opportunity to create a truly suspenseful game of psychological cat-and-mouse while showcasing powerhouse performances from Mel Gibson and Gary Sinise. Once the movie draws to a conclusion, the good points of this Catch-22 plot point outweigh the bad, but there are drawbacks. <br />Gibson is cast as wealthy airline owner Tom Mullen, living a picture-perfect life in New York City with his wife Kate (Rene Russo) and young son Sean (Brawley Nolte). All is as it should be until Sean is kidnapped from a science fair in Central Park, leaving Tom and Kate distraught and feeling helpless. Despite the kidnapper's warning that there be no police or law officials involved, Tom turns to the FBI, believing that this crime against him may have a connection to a payoff he made that landed gangster Jackie Brown in prison (the motivation behind the crime is never really cemented, but passed off as jealous rage for Tom's avoidance of prison for said payoff). <br />On the opposite end of the threatening phone calls and emails is detective Jimmy Baker (Gary Sinise), his girlfriend Maris (Lili Taylor), hacker whiz Miles (Evan Handler), and brothers Clark and Cubby Barnes (Liev Schreiber and Donnie Wahlberg). They make a demand of two millions dollars in return for the safe delivery of Tom's son, which Tom agrees to pay at the behest of Kate and the FBI officials assigned to the case. <br />To this day, I don't know why filmmakers even bother to include an FBI subplot in any crime thriller, given their obvious failures and mishaps in movies stretching back as far as time itself. Take, for instance, the scene in which Tom leaves to deliver the money in return for the address where his son is located. When he arrives forthe exchange with Cubby, who has told his brother he will not deliver the money until Baker delivers Tom's son, the FBI helicopters fill the night sky and ruin what would have been a successful payoff. Only after this incident does it ever occur to them that there might be more than one person involved in the kidnapping. <br />I also think the movie would benefit from keeping the identity of Sinise's character a secret until a sufficient point much later in the film, perhaps when he alerts the police to the boy's whereabouts. The presence of his fellow kidnappers is more than enough to suffice the mystery of his identity; it just seems like the old unknown mastermind plot twist would serve the movie better than knowing upfront. <br />And that's an even bigger problem, considering that the identity of this character is intrical to the effectiveness of the movie's turn of events, in which Tom turns his promised delivery of the ransom money into a bounty for the kidnappers' identities, provided they are captured and positively identified as such, of course. Risking his son's life and the disapproval from his wife, he dives into a dangerous mind game in which he challenges his son's captors to come clean without their expected reward, and despite the fact that we can predict how this plot twist will eventually end up, there is still a great deal of tension resonating from this psychological battle of the minds. <br />In addition to the high level of suspense, this thriller is armed with a sure-fire cast that hits all the right notes in all the right places. Tom's devotion to his son, as well as his wanting for nothing more than his safe return, is beautifully acted by Gibson, who delivers lines like &quot;Give me back my son!&quot; with a sublime mixture of fear and anger. Russo also receives high marks as a mother driven mad by all that's going on around her, and her scenes involving fits of anger and fright are hard-hitting and realistically acted. On the opposite endof the spectrum, Sinise portrays Baker's gradual breakdown with savage brutality, becoming more than just an ordinary movie villain. As the quartet of kidnappers, Taylor, Handler, Schreiber and Wahlberg each have moments where they shine. <br />Overall, I liked &quot;Ransom.&quot; I enjoyed its ability to keep me on edge while waiting for a plot twist I saw coming a mile away; I greatly enjoyed watching a wonderful cast exercising their most extreme talent; most of all, I relished the tension that centers on the mind game Tom engages in with those who wish to do his son harm. As much as I enjoyed it, I wonder how the movie would fare if Baker's identity as the mastermind were kept a secret, and whether or not the absence of the FBI from the story would make much of a difference; maybe we'll never know.
B000003S1A|5.0|These guys, four accomplished musicians, each reached a peak at this point and made shockingly great music together.  It was criminally underheard at the time and remains so.<br />The music retained elements of hard rock, and combined to them elements of various &quot;world&quot;/&quot;ethnic&quot; musics, including African pop.  Other artists were attempting variations on these influences (most prominently Talking Heads) but Crimson here created a music that outdoes them all.<br />Adrian Belew and Robert Fripp, two important guitarists, never played better.  Tony Levin's stick playing is beautifully creative and precise, and Bill Bruford is (as he tended to be) a brilliant player and undoubtably a creative spark (here, he moves to a partially electronic drum kit, and furthers the state of the art).<br />They never made music this natural or beautiful again.  But the music really demands to be heard.  You can hear it here, and/or on the live &quot;Absent Lovers&quot; record which contains even better readings of some of these tracks.
B00005QCVY|5.0|When I think of words to describe Frank Capra's masterpiece &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; only one word comes to mind: greatness. Greatness in its storytelling, which embodies the traditions and values of an American era gone by... greatness in its ability to generate some of the most complex characters in movie history from the simplest of human themes... greatness in its sense of heartfelt emotion and true knowledge of what life is really all about. Here is a movie that merits multiple viewings with each new holiday season, leaving its mark on each new generation while giving those familiar with it another chance to experience the magic. <br />People are most often surprised by the history of the film, which opened to moderate business at the box office, yet failed to muster the excitement and audience embracement that modern viewers have so lovingly bestowed upon it. Due to the weather, many people remained in their homes, while many who ventured to the bistro billed the film as too depressing for the Christmas season. And so, like a snowflake in the winter breeze, Frank Capra's slice-of-life film came and went like most modern movies of today. <br />Perhaps if its copyright had been renewed, we may never have known the true heart of this magnificent film, which has since become a traditional part of the holidays for many who revere the film as a classic; to bill it as anything but such is an injustice. The film has earned its popularity through its virtue and heartfelt emotional core, telling a story that serves as a model for humankind as well as a striking portrait of some of our country's most darkest days. <br />The story, originally a short story in the form of a Christmas card which was purchased by RKO Pictures for ten thousand dollars, takes us to the small town of Bedford Falls, where life is simple and people are filled with high spirits despite their hardships. At the center of this is George Bailey, played by Jimmy Stewart in one of the toweringscreen performances of all time; George has lofty ambitions that include &quot;seeing the world, building skyscrapers 1000 stories high,&quot; and &quot;a bridge a mile long.&quot; His idealistic view of the outside world is constantly put on hold, as he struggles to upkeep his deceased father's building and loan company, which is in danger of going under. <br />It may not appear so at first, but as the movie progresses, we can see just how much George does for his fellow man. He keeps the building and loan going as an outlet for those who have little or nothing to begin a better life without having to turn to Henry Potter (Lionel Barrymore), &quot;the richest and meanest man in the county&quot; who sees fit to keep the citizens of Bedford Falls under his rule. But George will not allow it, and so, with the help of his newly-acquired wife, Mary (Donna Reed), and his business partner, his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), he struggles to keep the town alive, ignoring his own dreams and aspirations for the greater good, never realizing the full impact he has on his fellow man until he is given a frightening glimpse of what may have been had he never been born at all, compliments of angel Clarence Oddbody, played by Henry Travers with real wit and acting ability.<br />Through all of this, George's life is shown in various lights, from the happiest moments a man could ever wish for, to the darkest depths of depression from which every man spends much of his life running from. This is why Capra's film succeeds so enormously: one minute we are in the murkiest recesses of life, as George searches frantically for a way out of his troubles. Through Capra's direction and Stewart's brilliant acting, much of this third act is infused with sheer terror that still manages to evoke chills, as he discovers what his absence would have meant to the people he met in his life. And then, after the realization that running from one's hardships provides no solace, he returns from his nightmare to discover his life in a completely different light, armed with the knowledge that &quot;no man is a failure who has friends.&quot; <br />The overall film itself is a wonderful mosaic of American life at its most jubilant and its most downtrodden. As George grows up, from a small boy working in a drug store, to an ambitious college-bound teenager struck by love when he lays eyes on his future wife, we bear witness to some of the landmarks of our nation's history, from a Charleston contest at a high school dance, to the Great Depression and World War II. Each character is affected by these events, yet their upbeat demeanor in the face of these trying times magnificently captures the human resolve, and we come to care for all of them a great deal more. <br />And just as Capra is working his magic behind the camera, his wonderful and now-landmark cast works much of their own onscreen. Stewart's performance is one of history's most memorable, and will not soon be forgotten so long as the film remains in our hearts. Donna Reed evokes a warm and caring nature as Mary, sharing a terrific bond with Stewart that makes the marriage between their two characters affectionate and loving, not to mention totally convincing. Thomas Mitchell's eccentric and frantic Uncle Billy is supplied with heart, while each supporting actor offers humor and heartfelt emotion to the town's most notable citizens. Barrymore, too, plays the miserly Mr. Potter with supreme and delectable nastiness, one of Hollywood's most memorable villains. <br />Despite a less-than-favorable history, &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; has reached its broad audience to find a home in everyone's hearts, with its wonderful storytelling, instantly likeable characters, and warm message about life. It takes risks in that it doesn't hide the hardships from view, but rather shows them in a most eerie and frightening manner, and this juxtaposition of gloom and happiness is the movie's biggest success. That, and its status as a great American film, a timeless classic which keeps us coming back for another slice of George Bailey's life each holiday season.
B00005QK5X|5.0|Greg Sage and the Wipers make music that defies classification. Sure, the references here are definatly &quot;punk&quot; but calling The Wipers just a &quot;punk rock&quot; band is like calling Van Gogh just a &quot;painter&quot;. I think Van Gogh is a pretty decent analogy for the incredible music Sage has made over his 20+ years in music. He has never compromised his intregity in anyway, and has gone through some pretty horrible &quot;music-business&quot; type experiences, but continues to remain focused on his prime directive. Many people compare him to Jimi Hendrix (blazing sonic fury, incredibly melodic guitar riffs), and that is not entirely incorrect. With this box set you get The Wipers first 3 albums, &quot;Is This Real&quot;, &quot;Youth Of America&quot;, and &quot;Over The Edge&quot; along with 23 bonus cuts!!!! With 6 never before released songs!!! Wow I can't recommend this highly enough. I have even seen some people comparing The Strokes to The Wipers, so for all the people that are going nuts for the new &quot;flavor of the week&quot;, check out where it all came from.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is the first cd that I listened to all the tracks and liked them all with the exeption of &quot;cure for the itch&quot; but otherwise this is a good album with no low spots whatsoever. An a note for parents belive your kids when they say this album contains no profane languge.
6304806426|2.0|I expected to love The English Patient for many of the same reasons that people love Casablanca--WWII romance, exotic setting, memorable characters.... but I was badly disappointed. The central relationship between Fiennes and Scott-Thomas (who is, in my view, just another name in the long list of anorexic actresses that Hollywood uses, then loses)is flat and uninteresting, so my overall reaction is: who gives a hoot about these two? As another reviewer pointed out, it's more lust than love, but as the film moves toward its denouement, you're suddenly supposed to believe that he cares so much about her that he'll risk his life to save her. It's just not believable. It all adds up to an overly self-conscious (albeit pretty) film that can't hold a candle to the stirring love story that unfolds in Rick's Cafe Americain.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Great, interesting &amp; witty script, awesome animation and voices. This is one of the best movies ever!
B00005U11Z|5.0|This is one incredible music DVD and the best I have ever had in my hands. Leaves you feeling like you won the coveted front row seat for the concert of the year. Great performances by new lead singer Steve Augeri who is incredible beyond belief and talent becomes him. Deen is amazing on drums. Neal speaks to us all on his guitar. Ross makes us laugh at silly looks while giving us some incredible base playing. Jon touches our heart and soul with his work on the invories. One steller performance by five talented souls. Truly one you wouldn't want to miss out on.
B00003CXB7|5.0|One of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Imagine the TV show pushing the envelope of humor with rampant dirty jokes and sex.  I despised the TV show.  The movie rocks, so smart it makes today's comedy look like uninspired folly.
B00005QDW1|5.0|After enjoying the dark and more personal &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;, I anticipated a great new follow-up. I recieved what I wanted, a great record, for the exact opposite reasons the previously mentioned disc was good. Energetic, happy, and danceable, &quot;Rock Steady&quot; takes the group to another place. After some choice collaborations with Moby on his track &quot;South Side&quot; and Eve on her smash &quot;Let Me Blow Ya Mind&quot;. Gwen takes what she's learned from exploring new styles of music and mixes it up with a dance hall vibe. The result is a pop record with a tougher No Doubt edge, but the energy and danceability of your Britney Spears. It's different from before, but that's something that really makes this shine. Mixing Gwen's lyrics, reggae energy, and some very qualified producers, the songs that really leave a mark include the first release &quot;Hey Baby, and the tracks &quot;Hella Good&quot; and &quot;Making Out&quot;. All three are particularly good, and show of the new eclectic sound that is No Doubt.
B000002J09|5.0|Sureley there is more to Led Zeppelin than the emotional ride of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, and there is, in large amounts.  IV is a musical feat and an audacious example of great rock n' roll.  The album has no pinnacle, and not even a low point.  If you haven't heard IV or at least one of Zeppelins first two gold accomplishments, then you haven't heard great music.
630469878X|5.0|This film has so many wonderful elements, from the funny little asides (&quot;sir, you're standing in your pizza&quot;) to the lonely, still faces of the American West that the camera captures to examine against the wild exhilaration of Thelma &amp; Louise's journey. There's mystery, too: what really happened to Louise in Texas?? All the performances beginning with Sarandon and Davis are outstanding, producing unforgettable characters. If I'm not mistaken, this was Brad Pitt's first major picture; who can forget his encounter with Thelma's husband in the police station?<br />There's a strong feminist theme to be sure, but at heart the film is really about freedom, free will, the nature of criminality, and restraints on human behavior (and the consequences of lifting them). This is inherently understood by the police officer played by Harvey Keitel, who is deeply concerned for the well-being of the two fugitives from justice while showing no compunction about roughing up the petty crook played by Pitt.<br />The icing on the cake: a GREAT soundtrack (available on CD, and definitely worth buying separately!)
B000001DTM|5.0|If THE JOSHUA TREE was U2's answer to American music, then ACHTUNG BABY is their answer to their European cousins.  Gone are the country'n'western influences of U2's previous two albums, replaced with the cool, sleek danceable rhythms of the Berlin dance clubs.  Emotional and hip, sincere and sarcastic, ACHTUNG manages to combine wildly differing styles into one coherent work that ranks with the best albums ever recorded.<br />From the opening seconds of &quot;Zoo Station&quot;, it's clear that this is a radically different U2.  Not only is the music drastically changed from the twangy sounds of albums past, but the lyrics are becoming introspective again with a slight tendency for tongue-in-cheek humour at times.  Despite the fast rhythms and danceable beat, this is a dark album, perhaps one of the darkest that the band has released.  But it's emotion that's been wallpapered over with neon and silver-coloured material.  It's angst and pain in a nice techno-flavoured sugar pill.<br />Again, U2 has created an album that is more than just a combination of great songs.  ACHTUNG BABY flows extraordinarily well.  Each track adds a lot to the whole while managing to retain individuality.  The album is incredibly focused as well, with a great feeling of longing, regret and inaccessibility being maintained for the entirety.  This focus is hard for other bands to do, yet something that U2 achieves with surprisingly regularity.<br />In addition to being an incredibly deep album, it's also an extremely fun one to listen to.  The dance beats are amazingly infectious, and Edge's guitar playing has never been better.  It's hard to point to any tracks that stand out, since they are all quite exceptional.  This is one of the few albums that has no tracks that are just average.
B00005JKES|1.0|Not only am I returning this incomplete &quot;complete&quot; first season because it doesn't have the pilot episode, but also because it doesn't say anything about the missing episode on the packaging until you have it home and open it.  And even then you don't know for certain that it's incomplete until you actually start the first disc and see footage from a previous episode that you don't even have.  $50 for fraud!  Nice try Artisan, I guess Blair Witch 2 didn't make enough money.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I like Shakira, and this cd was pretty good. It's great that all the songs were different but you didn't know what kind of thing she was going for. I would recommend but be aware.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Memento definitely performs in terms of keeping an intelligent and expectful viewer entertained and wondering what's next.  The acting is magnificent with the exception of Joe Pantolino who plays the greasy mugging role as usual.  The direction is great and Guy Pearce really captures the character without playing over the top at all.  Lovely and understated.  The problems I do find with the film are the black and white sequences which although very captivating, are not clarified for the viewer distinctly in terms of when in time they happen.  Another problem I have is the resolution for us...so, did he do her with the needle or did he commit the heinous acts he thought he saw John G commit???  This is totally unclear because the Teddy character suggests both that his wife had diabetes...but he also said that Shelby had killed the real John G and gave proof with the photos.  Is this some huge glitch the director didn't bother working out because he felt the audience would just think...&quot;oooooh...he did imagined it&quot; and just forget the details?  I don't like working for a film attention-wise and getting peanuts in return.  <br />As for how could he remember his condition...something several people keep asking...Um...did you notice that &quot;Remember Sammy Jankis&quot; tattoo on his hand?  I think that's what it was for.  <br />Either way...the entertainment was 4 stars...but if the director really did screw it up the way I think he did...he deserves to give me my money back for being such an untalented dolt.  <br />Feedback please.
B00005B36H|4.0|If there's any band that uses the gap between album releases to spawn anticipation and alleviation for musical need, it's Tool.  Lateralus adds to bands already gaping jar of Rock-opus albums.  &quot;The Grudge&quot; starts off the opus with a dynamic range as big as one of Yes's early monsters.  Even the packaging is a spectacle to behold.  Carey's awing drum solo beginning to &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot;, and the communication tale of &quot;Schism&quot; are the real killers, that will have you gripping your ears to hear the swift time-signutare changes as well as the tight pack of 4 strong musicians.  And with out a doubt, the 2 song run of &quot;Disposition&quot; and &quot;Reflection&quot; is the all-out rock experience of 2001.
B000001DQI|5.0|'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road' epitomises why many consider Elton John's early career to be his best work. It features great ballads like 'Candle in the Wind' and 'The Ballad of Danny Bailey'; hard rock tracks like 'Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting'; slow melodies like 'Sweet Painted Lady'; and gritty, sombre tracks like 'Funeral for a Friend' and 'All the Young Girls Love Alice'. What's best about early Elton is that the choruses of each song are amazing. They are a confluence of many instruments, lifting off with John's strong yet equally melodic vocals. The best example is 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road', the title track, where the chorus resolves and heightens the emotions of the verses. This is the same for all of the songs in the album, and for me, they are the best part.  <br />In terms of lyrics, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is a sprawling canvas of sleaze, broken dreams and hard lives. Bernie Taupin, the lyricist, doesn't shy from using lines like \\"someone grab that (girl)by the hair\\" in 'Dirty Little Girl', and doesn't sentimentalise the fact that Alice, the girl from 'All the Young Girls Love Alice', was found \\"in the subway dead,\\" and was a callgirl (...). It's this kind of hard hitting, gritty content, merged with Elton John's brilliant music that makes 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road' such a brilliant album. If anyone wanted to know what his early music was like before it turned sappy and sentimental, this is the answer.
B000001EAQ|4.0|The same hard sound. The same emotion. The same tone as ever. For some reason dressing these familiar U2 elements up in a flashier suit of techno and dance rhythms than even ACHTUNG BABY wore seemed to turn off a lot of fans. Quite a pity, as this really is one of U2's strongest albums and a good follow-up to the triumphs of ACHTUNG and ZOOROPA.<br />The much talked about techno elements are really only obviously apparent on the opening three tracks (though traces would appear here and there for the remaining songs). The opening three are great rocking sounds that go beyond just the glitter that they're dressed up in. Bono once described this album as one that starts off at a party and ends up at a funeral (and, of course, he'd know what he's talking about), and it manages to sustain this tone quite well.<br />Individually, there are a lot of really appealing tunes on here. &quot;Gone&quot; is a loud rocker that combines some fantastic guitar work from Edge with some wonderful sounding piano sounds. &quot;Discotheque&quot; is just a fun song that is an energetic way to start off an album. &quot;Staring At The Sun&quot; manages to sound retro, yet new enough to still sound as fresh as the rest of the tracks. &quot;Mofo&quot; is a song that sounds so trashy and throwaway on first listen, that it comes as an incredible shock once you start paying attention and realize how personal it is.<br />One of U2's more seriously underrated albums, POP sounds quite fresh and engaging. It's unfortunate that the singles off of this recording get such little air-play, but get yourself a copy and discover an underappreciated classic from one of the world's best rock'n'roll bands.
B00005QFE5|5.0|A superior performance than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Zhang Ziyi stars as a village woman, of whom is the most beautiful, that falls in love with the village teacher. Her performance, though mostly silent, is excellent, and perfect. All characters give great performances, and we can't forget the great direction from the master Chinese director himself, Zhang Yimou. The scenery takes us through the rural side of China, as well as the poor side. The musical score helps build all emotions, and impacts greatly at the touching and moving ending...This is definitely a magnificent film, memorable, and meaningfull. I strongly reccommend this movie for all willing to learn of life.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies ever created. Even if you've never become a Monty Python fanatic, you will be rolling on the floor laughing after viewing this film....truly a sight to behold. Keep the box of tissues near because you'll be laughing so hard that you'll be crying. Ni!
B00003CXGG|4.0|I think the movie is wonderful, but I could be a bit bias since I love Aaliyah. I saw this movie the first week it came out, and I also bought the VHS version right when it came out. I just recently got a DVD player, and I really want to get this movie so I can see the extra footage. I love Aaliyah, and I loved the movie. it was really good, and I thought the cast that they chose was wonderful. they gave everyone the right role -- but I think they could have found someone else to play jet-li's role, he was a little too old for aaliyah. they could have found someone younger who was great at martial arts, too.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Make Yourself was a breakthrough for Incubus, complete with a load of catchy, fairly positive tunes, and an almost fulfilling denouncement of their early rap/rock creations.  So that makes Morning View an almost flawless release from a band that seems to eveolve with every waking step.  With everything from the beautifully estranged &quot;Mexico&quot; to the mosh metal of &quot;Blood On The Ground&quot; and the gregarious keeper &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, this CD is everything it should be.  Singer Brandon Boyd, with his sturdy vocal range keeps it postive, while the rest of the band writes a musically effective soundtrack.  Rap/rock cliches?  Not in this life.  Incubus is much more adult than that, and they've got a musical masterpiece to back it up.
6300214044|5.0|The Elephant Man is not a movie for kids. It disscuses the theme of hate strongly. My parents allowed me to see it because they didn't want me to turn into a polittically incorrect idiot when I grow up.(sometimes, we can't help being polittically incorrect, but after some time, it gets bad and you start turning into another fool) I'm mature enough to see this, most kids are not.<br />This is the saddest movie I've ener seen. I've seen many movies(around 120) for a kid, and Ithis is the ONLY one that has made me cry.(I haven't seen Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan, but those will probably make me cry, too) John Hurt plays John Merrick withan amazing amount of emotion. I believe that this is Anthony Hopkins FINEST role in a movie. He STEALS the show! This is fabolus directing by David Lynch. The starting scene is really scary!(Why does that even matter?) This is my seventh favorite move ever!
B000001F5F|4.0|Unless you've been living in a cave for the past few decades, you'll no doubt be familiar with the songs that are on this live release (and since you're obviously a hip, with-it, and technologically-friendly person who browses dot coms for your music needs, we can safely discount the cave-theory).  For a recording of material that's as well-known as these tracks are, the question is not &quot;How good are the songs?&quot; but rather &quot;How good of a live band are these people?&quot;  Happily, U2 give some of the best live performances in music today, and UNDER A BLOOD RED SKY gives a great sample of some of their earliest songs.<br />The sound quality on this album is quite good -- not great, but quite good.  There are a few places where it isn't as clear as one would like it, but it is certainly listenable.  The recordings are taken from several different dates, rather than all being from the same concert.  However, this shouldn't be a problem for anyone other than the die-hard purists.<br />The performances of the songs themselves are well up to U2's excellent standards.  No matter how good something sounds that U2 has created in the studio, their live performance of the same material will almost always end up sounding superior.  The songs included here are further proof of this.  &quot;Gloria&quot;, &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, &quot;I Will Follow&quot; and &quot;The Electric Company&quot;, in particular, come across with a lot more passion and energy.  Even the reworked version of &quot;Party Girl&quot; works amazingly well.<br />If you like early U2 then there shouldn't be any hesitation about picking up this album.  It sounds fresh and alive.  The material is still new to the world and to the band performing it.  It's definitely worth it for anyone interesting in having a great collection of U2's best early material.
B00005RIKD|5.0|Sting freely explores new variations to his songs, but keeps to the original material enough to make it familiar and enjoyable
B000002UR7|4.0|This one is a great start for a band.<br />I first got the CD because of &quot;Creep&quot;, but after listening to the record from &quot;You&quot; to &quot;Blow Out&quot; a few times, I realized that &quot;Creep&quot; is merely one of the great songs in this album. Tracks like &quot;Stop Whispering&quot;, &quot;Thinking About You&quot;, &quot;Vegetable&quot;, &quot;I Can't&quot; and &quot;Lurgee&quot; are just precious, and for what I know, very underrated. And the rest of it is not bad at all.<br />Go get it. You won't regret it.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I love this movie SO much! I saw this movie with a friend, really late at night at the movie threatre the first week it came out, and I loved. I guess I liked it because I love musical theatre, and I think that nicole kidman is a wonderful actress. she plays a marvelous role in this film. the story is great, the affects are great, the theatricals are great, EVERYTHING's great. I adored the movie, and I suggest that all of you go out and get it!
B00003CWL5|1.0|American Beauty is rediculous and just another bad flop made in today's days I really cannot stand this film. And this is supposed to sort of portray an american family that is just a bunch of bull. Please somebody write up a good film sooner or later!
B000001FA4|5.0|Almost as if WAR had never happened, U2 return with a dreamy and atmospheric work  .  And yet the harder edge of that angry album is still present underneath it all, driving the music forward.  The result of this strange mixture is magical and wonderful.  This is U2's first album that sounds really complete and it's something that shouldn't be passed up by anyone.<br />This would be the first collaboration between U2 and producer Brian Eno and as an experiment it really works well.  Some of U2's best known and best sounding material is contained on this album.  From the ubiquitous &quot;Pride (In The Name Of Love)&quot; to the little known, and seriously underrated &quot;Elvis Presley and America&quot;, there's very little here that isn't fantastic.  The tone that begins at the start of the album manages to sustain itself for the entirety.  This is really quite an achievement, as there are far too many albums that start well but sputter out somewhere before the end.  On THE FORGETTABLE FIRE, the magic is sustained well.<br />A moody, atmospheric album that works on almost every level.  It's a much more mature work than what we'd seen from U2 in the past.  The dreamy tone is quite effective and stands up quite well to repeated listens.  One of the best albums, not just from U2, but from all that the 80's had to offer.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|great work 4 christina although we know she can do better. some suggests she overdoes it but i think she is proving her awesome talent and range! i love this album! i listen 2 it all year round!

B000021YQV|5.0|Talk about non stop energy. System Of A Down's sophmore release, \\"Toxicity\\" has people talking, and talking loud. Hailed as \\"one of the best albums, EVER\\" by many critics, SOAD shuts down the skeptics and the critics who thought they could not top their debut album.<br />Not only does it top the album, it blows it out of the water. Serj and he boys have really done their job here, and offer a unique brand of metal that stands out from most of the nu-metal/rapcore sludge out there.<br />A must-have for all rock fans, \\"Toxicity\\" will have you pumped up for a long time.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Simply put, if you don't have this cd... GET IT! This is the album I knew he could make. Great band too. Sounds like he's taking chances again. If youre looking for Band on the Run, get that. If youre looking for some great new music from the greatest songwriter/singer of all time, get Driving Rain.
B000001FRY|4.0|It's interesting to listen to BOY with the benefit of hindsight.  Lead singer Bono would, of course, become one of the most recognizable figures in rock'n'roll.  The band itself would go through remarkable periods of reinvention, rivaling only Madonna herself in terms of change and renewal.  But this is just about where it all first began and the greatness that they would go on to achieve can be seen even as far back as their first album.<br />BOY is very much a product of its time.  Released in 1980, it neatly sums up almost the entirety of that moment in time for rock music.  Although punk has been declared &quot;dead&quot; and new wave has still yet to completely take up the reins, BOY neatly straddles the divide, with the influence of both musical schools quite apparent on every track.  And mixed in with the differing musical styles lie the seeds of what would go on to become the core of the U2 sound.<br />U2 has always made better albums than individual songs, and this is apparent even on their first offering here.  Surprisingly for a debut release, this is a very coherent work, with each song fitting neatly alongside its peers.  All the songs have a similar feel while still managing to retain their individuality.  Edge's guitar work feels relatively confident, though there are a few moments where it seems slightly unsure, understandable given how young the band was at this point.  Bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen have yet to assert themselves as a formidable rhythm section, though it seems unfair to compare their work here to what they would achieve later.  At worst the material is simply competent, but at best it is almost magical.<br />There are a few really rocking songs here and a scattering of slower material.  There's a lot of boyish, brash confidence on this recording and it's fairly contagious if you're in the right mood to enjoy it.  It's quite an interesting album to listen to for U2 fans, and for fans of rock music in general.  This isdefinitely a worthy release.
B00000J6AG|5.0|It's a simple CD, the music is good and simple,  and it doesn't sound just like &quot;electronic&quot; music. Moby is creating a new style by mixing gospels and R&amp;B with electronic rythms. If you are interested in following the latest trends, or if you want to make a nice gift to someone, buy this CD.
B0000508U6|5.0|Their harmonies are quite simple and sad, and their lyrics are quite simple. But as a whole, their music is really lovely. It is special like Jeff Buckley and Radiohead's music - not necessarily similar, except for its specialness. Maybe the quality of specialness is heartfeltness. I do not know. But I like it.  This CD is lovely; thumbs up, thumbs up.
B00004Z459|4.0|I bought this album the day it came out, without any previous knowledge of LP. I was pleasantly suprised at how good they are. This album os very good, though a bit short. If you like this, try to get songs from their Hybrid Theory EP.
B000001F3C|4.0|WAR is very angry album.  It's also much more focused that its predecessor, OCTOBER, was and feels as coherent as U2's debut, BOY, did.  This is a much more emotional band than the four young men we had seen before.  Moving from the introspection of the first two releases, U2 turned their attention outside to the rest of the world.  The result was a statement that was hopeful and looking towards the future, yet carried a dark measure of cynicism throughout it.<br />Musically, the band has come a long way.  Edge's guitar licks are much more refined and assured here.  Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen are a much smoother rhythm section here than they had been in the past.  The music has a much tougher feel to it than their first albums.  The dreamy, echoing atmospherics from BOY and OCTOBER are mostly gone, leaving a very tough, hard center behind.<br />This is a rough album.  The music hits fairly hard and the lyrics are able to match the intensity.  It's emotional and raw, and definitely one of U2's best.
B00003CXTF|3.0|i thought that parts of this movie were good, but parts of  it were kind of sappy. the action-filled parts were good, but the love parts were not very good. Overall, this movie was alright, but not the one of the best.
0783229364|5.0|1987's 'The Secret of my Success' was looked at by producers and possibly Mike himself as just another way to keep himself busy and broaden his fame while in the 'Family Ties' era. But 'The Secret of My Success' exploded when Michael J.

Fox comes to New York from a small country farm where his parents live, to give a familiar story of determination to succeed in a city that still rings true: &quot;If I Can Make It There.....&quot; Fox gets one foot in the door of a major corporation when his jerk uncle Howard Prescott decides to hire him in the mail room. The movie is perfect for Mike, whos' tremendous acting talent lends itself well to a young boy who works his way up the ladder of a multi-national corporation headed by a creep, and on the verge of overturning. I make it sound too dark though...the movie is non-stop laughs and an uplifting story that really does put a permanant smile on your face. Along with the greatest soundtrack Ive ever heard, which if youre buying this movie you HAVE to get the CD too, with all original songs and scores by performers like Pat Benatar, Night Ranger, David Foster, and Restless Heart. I can tell you right now if you've ever watched an episode of 'Family Ties', ever saw 'Back To the Future' 5 or 6 times in the last 4 years on tv or loved Fox's reign on 'Spin City'...this movie is perfect for you. A fast-paced, hilarious, energetic and cheerful movie that's great for the whole family. It deffinately gives us one of the many great things to remember about our friend.
B00005BL2A|5.0|Depeche Mode has been around for a long time, and their music, as well as the band, has seen a lot of changes. Depeche Mode can adapt, as they show in Exciter, and come out shining. &quot;Comatose&quot; is dark and beautiful, &quot;When The Body Speaks&quot; is soft and soothing. Get this CD, if you are a Depeche Mode fan, you WON'T be disappointed.
B000001FS6|3.0|What are we to make of RATTLE AND HUM?  It's definitely an oddity in the U2 canon, being, by far, their least coherent album.  Can we blame this lack of coherence on the fact that it's supposedly a soundtrack to the film, and therefore was restricted by the format that this implied?  Probably not, as the assembly of the album didn't seem to feel bound by what had appeared in the film.  After all, the order of certain songs is different, some songs are missing and others sound slightly different.  So we can make no excuses and just judge the material by what we have.<br />It's difficult to even sum up this one.  It's a mixture of live songs and studio material.  It combines old songs and new.  It contains tracks performed by U2 as well as cover versions of other famous songs.  This results in a meandering feel, as though the track listing was put together totally at random.  On the best U2 albums, one can change the tone simply by reordering the songs; you cannot do that here.  Little thought seems to have gone into the make up of album.  Some tracks are just filler.  Some tracks don't feel quite finished.  And some tracks just don't sound like they have anything to do with the rest .<br />Musically, this CD is also a bit of a mixed bag.  The cover versions range from the wonderful rendering of The Beatles' &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; to a lackluster performance of Bob Dylan's &quot;All Along The Watchtower&quot; (note to any bands considering which of somebody else's songs they should perform: never cover a song that Jimi Hendrix already covered, because you're setting yourself up for a formidable task of matching him).  &quot;All I Want Is You&quot; and &quot;Hawkmoon 269&quot; are bordering on sheer brilliance, but where did &quot;Love Rescue Me&quot; and &quot;Heartland&quot; come from?<br />RATTLE AND HUM is an album that ends up being less than the sum of its parts.  While containing some fabulous individual tracks, this release never seems to come together in the way that it should.  There's too much filler, too much stuff that simply doesn't feel like it belongs.  This CD should be recommended, as there is some marvelous stuff contained on it, but bear in mind that U2 have done much better.
B00005JKMO|5.0|I knew from the first advertisement on television that this would be great. I could see it in the look on Will Smith's face. We were not disappointed. Will Smith's dedication to &quot;become&quot; Ali, is nothing short of amazing. We both grew up watching Ali in the news and in the ring. His sharp tongue infuriated my Grand Mother but intrigued &amp; entertained me. Ali always had what it took to back up his mouth. This is true filming excellence, and Will Smith really takes and gives the shots. There are some things that can't be faked, and Will Smith did Ali the justice that he deserves. Also, the sound track envelopes you completely, making you feel the surge of the crowd and the energy of the moment. WOW. The only seats left in the theater were 4 rows from the front. Perfect. Almost &quot;Ring Side.&quot; What a ride! Over too soon, we emerged from the theater pumped with adrenaline. We went to see it a second time. It's THAT GOOD.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This isn't a collection that represents every Floyd era, but that was never the point.  Instead what they have given us is some of their best work, according to them.  Yes you could sit around and ask &quot;Why is there no 3rd CD?&quot;, but then people would complain at having to spend more! The song selection won't please everybody.<br />The remastering is brilliant.  The old tracks have new life breathed into them.  They way each song segues into the next is great.  The song order may look all over the place, but everything flows greatly.  Some tracks have been cut in length to fit, but it hardly affects the songs (although Marooned should have been left untouched).<br />As for the actual songs themsevles, they are all classics.  And I hope that people realise that you can't place Pink Floyd's style into one genre of music (their is no true Floyd sound, but there is a consistent feel to their work).  To compare each era of the band (Syd to Roger to Dave) is ridiculous, as over the 30 year span of the band, each album takes on a different musical and lyrical approach than the last, and each album is brilliant in its own right.<br />Simply put, Echoes is a great collection of songs from a great band.  Probably their last, but what a way to go out.
0780622553|2.0|Going against the grain, I was disappointed by this film. It looked like a million bucks, had outstanding art direction, set design, and special effects. In that, there was vision. But the story is convoluted, and often has nothing coherent to keep it driving forward. Like it suffered from an identify crisis. I often felt like I was watching something impressive (and expensive), but with nothing in the story to keep my curiosity going or my anticipation up I had a hard time keeping interest.
B000001E18|5.0|One of the most creative albums of all time.  A strange basis for an album - apparently their primary influence for this creation was their own stageshow, touring their ACHTUNG BABY at the same time as recording this.  It may take a little while for the listener to full appreciate this album (the first few times I listen to it, I didn't know what to make of it - it took me years to fully &quot;get it&quot;), but once you start understanding the flow of it, the pay off is well worth it.<br />ZOOROPA is an amazingly complex album on many different levels.  Even a simple song such as &quot;Numb&quot;, which on the surface appears to be nothing more than just Edge rapping over a simple guitar rhythm, has a multi-layered texture that reveals more on every listen.  Songs such as &quot;Lemon&quot; and &quot;Zooropa&quot; just sound effortless.<br />Perhaps the short time they had to record this caused U2 to be less conservative in their approach.  With little room for debate as to what they should or shouldn't do, they may have been forced to take more risks than they ordinarily would.  Whatever the reason for the experimentation, it's an unqualified success.  It's a pity that U2 shun most of the songs off of this album in their live shows as these tracks really are first rate.
B000050XEI|1.0|Well, we have finally discovered an alternative to novacaine in the dentist's office. This drivel put me to sleep in 10 seconds! The simplistic repetitive droning is a waste of time and money. Yes, she has a lovely voice, but this is some of the most boring &quot;music&quot; ever recorded. Anyone who likes this stuff needs to get out more often and try other forms of real music!
0783114222|5.0|If you were born in the sixties and you want to remember the Apollo program or if you want your kids to watch and learn what going to the moon was all about you must get this DVD ! Superb grapics, touching music, great acting. <BR>Special note : I have read newsgroup reports of people who actually WORKED on the Appllo project saying that the series was flawless and provided an authentic representation of the Apollo era. If you love space there is no way you will not love From the Earth to the Moon.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I am a big fan of the Coen brothers, as most of the people who give movie this 4 or 5 stars are, so I may be a little bit biased.  I was not a huge fan of this movie at first; it just didn't seem as funny to me as it was intended to be.  However, after watching &quot;Sullivan's Travels&quot; recently and re-watching &quot;O Brother&quot; (to save space, I'll leave out their connection; it can be found in other reviews on Amazon), it was MUCH funnier for me-&quot;Sullivan&quot; definitely put me in the right mind-set for this.  After a few viewings, you can also pick up all the great dialog you may have missed, and you notice all the elements that are in here-Homer, &quot;old-timey&quot; music, American folklore (the crossroads, the klan, etc), road pictures, Preston Sturges' influence, and alot of the trademark Coen brothers stuff.  It seems to me that being familiar with any of these is definitely helpful in enjoying this film.  That's what gives it 5 stars for me; I'd have given it 4 stars before seeing &quot;Sullivan's Travels&quot; and really taking the time to soak everything up that's in &quot;O Brother.....&quot;
B000001FS3|4.0|THE JOSHUA TREE is one of the definitive albums of the 1980s. Nary a list of the greatest recordings of that decade exists that doesn't mention THE JOSHUA TREE somewhere on it, usually occupying one of the top spots. Does it really deserve all the praise that's thrown at it? Mostly, it does. It's slightly overrated, but it's still one of the best collection of songs that you'll ever come across.<br />Famously, this is the album recorded after U2 had &quot;discovered&quot; American music outside of rock'n'roll. Country'n'western, gospel, blues and American folk are all heavily influences though at the core are the same musical sensibilities that were at the heart of WAR, THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE and BOY. They manage to combine these new elements with what they had before resulting in something that, while not being one or the other, is still distinctive and still great.<br />The first few songs on the album are the most recognizable tracks off of this release. &quot;Where The Streets Have No Name&quot;, &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot; and &quot;With Or Without You&quot; are familiar even to people who couldn't tell the difference between U2's Bono and Sonny Bono. But there is still a wealth of great material to be found later in the album. &quot;Running To Stand Still&quot; is a criminally underrated song that deserves as much recognition as the above-mentioned three tracks. It's impossible to listen to &quot;Trip Through Your Wires&quot; without wanting to dance (or at the very least, tapping your foot), while &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; is an emotional and understated goodbye to a departed friend.<br />While the majority of the second half of the album isn't as demanding as the first, it's definitely good music. A tad bit overrated, and not U2's greatest album, THE JOSHUA TREE still manages to stand alongside the best recordings of the 1980s. It's worth (most of) the hype.
B00003CX5P|1.0|This movie is a stick in the eye from Lucas to his now-ex-viewers.  Childish covers the whole thing.  It's a movie written for children and apparently by children.  Unless you have very small children in your house, don't bother getting this.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I hadn't seen the movie in the theaters but decided to buy the dvd as the critics were really great about this movie .<BR>I first saw it yesterday and there are no words to describe this movie.Wonderful,strange,and above exciting and beautifully done.<BR>Ewan Mcgregor and nicole kidman really shine in their performance and the songs are beautifully choreographed.<BR>the dvd is also very heavily packed and well deserved to be bought.Hate it or love it this is one hell of a movie and the best of a dull summer .
B000002B7O|5.0|This cd is Randy Rhoad's last album.  We will all miss you Randy R.I.P.  The two best songs on this cd are &quot;Flying High Again&quot; and &quot;Over The Mountain&quot;.  &quot;Flying High Again&quot; is just a great rock song and doesn't get the airtime on radios that it deserves.  &quot;Over The Mountain&quot; is a great rock song although it can wear thin.
B000001FTQ|4.0|U2 make great albums, but they put on even better concerts.  The songs that they write in the studio take on a life of their own when performed live.  What WIDE AWAKE IN AMERICA has in its favour is that exactly half of the track listing is made up of live recordings from their UNFORGETTABLE FIRE tour.  The disadvantage, of course, is that this only consists of two songs. <br />The two live tracks are excellent.  I've heard many different live versions of &quot;Bad&quot; performed and this has to be one of the best.  They did a great job at managing to capture such a vital performance and transferring all the energy onto the physical tape.  &quot;A Sort Of Homecoming&quot; is a nicely understated song that works well here.  The two B-sides are quite good as well, and it's nice to see them in a place where they won't be forgotten about.<br />The four songs that are included on here are quite good.  They come highly recommended as a great collection of songs from this era of U2.  The only downside is that you may not want to pay full-album price for a CD that is really only four songs long.  If you're a big U2 fan, then it may be worth it.  If not, then there are better value discs that you can pick up.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|... if looking for the pretty voice, go elsewhere. Bob Dylan, at age 60, has produced some of the best music in an otherwise uneventful year for decent music.<br />Bob's never had a pretty voice that soothes the soul. In forty years, he has gone through many changes. Two failed marriages, the early loss of his father, the recent loss of his mother, his backing band. Through it all, he smoked and drank his voice to its current state. <br />No Dylan album is bad. No Dylan album is typical. I'd bet he makes music for himself, and if we like it, so we do.<br />As producer as well as artist, he discards Daniel Lanois' overblown production for a simple five-to-seven-piece arrangement on twelve songs that actually sound different (as opposed to the crap by today's artists). <br />Simple words, bizarre instruments for a popular artist to use (banjo, mandolin, violin), and two weeks time have produced a gem in an otherwise uneventful year. If you buy one album in the next year, buy &quot;Love And Theft&quot;.
B00000099Y|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS IN THE HISTORY OF ALBUMS! FROM BEGINNING TO END THIS IS PERFECTION, A RARE JEM IN THE CLUTTER OF UNINSPIRED CORPORATE JUNK THAT GETS PUSHED DOWN OUR THROATS. INTELLIGENT, ANGRY, REFLECTIVE, EXPERIMENTAL, ALL THE MAKINGS OF GENIUS. OWN IT AND BE TRANSPORTED TO THE REALMS OF ABSOLUTE MUSIC BEAUTY!
B000002JS8|5.0|First of all I would like to say Rest In Peace Scott, we all miss you.  Now that is said, lets move on to the cd.  The title track Highway To Hell is the best song on that cd.  The other great song on that cd is Girls Got Rhythmn because the song is catchy and just plain fun.  The other songs on the cd are ok but those two songs are the best on that cd.
B00003CXWV|5.0|Blow is a story about the biggest drug dealer on the West Coast, George Jung. It takes place in the 70's and early 80's and Jung is played by Johnny Deep.<br />There are several aspects to this film that make it great.<br />1. No matter how hard he tries George Jung can never get the approval of his parents, because he is making money illegally.<br />2. The more money Mr. Jung makes, it never seems that he is happy with his life.<br />3. When the characters start using drugs more frequently, you see them start to look worse and worse because of this.<br />4. No matter who he considers a friend, there are no friends in the drug business and George finds this out the hard way. When he is in jail the first time he forms a partnership with Diego, who has ties in Colombia and wants to move Coke. His other buddy Derek (Paul Reubens) helped George when he was dealing Pot, also gets involved because he helped George move 50 kilos (110 lbs) of coke in little over one day. Diego then decides to hook up with Derek and together fade out George, they basically cut out the middle man. His two friends stab him in the back and this is when he decides he is out.<br />5. One of his old buddies is part of a crew he works with towards the end, so he can have one last score and start a new life in Cali with his daughter. Little does he know that he will get stabbed in the back again because the crew is paid off by the FBI and DEA and bring George down for good!<br />Those are just some of the things, but there is plenty more in this movie especially his wife Mirtha (Penelope Cruz) who sets him up as well. You owe it to yourself to watch this movie at least twice and then buy because it is that good!
B00005JKHP|5.0|This is a must have DVD, the added scenes and new effects are so seamless and flow so well you will think it was like that from the very begininng at the cinema. But the documentaries show<BR>how they improved it, and it does make a difference. The only complaint I have is that the interviews consist of recent interviews with William Shatner, Stephen Collins, Walter Koenig, Majel Barret, XON (forget the actors name), no other members of the cast were interviewed. WHY wasn't all the hours and hours of interviews that Paramount must have from Entertainment Tonight not featured on the discs also?
B000002J20|5.0|'Yes', the definitive progressive/art rock band of the seventies, once again show that they are compositional giants of the rock world. <BR>&quot;Tales From Topographic Oceans&quot; features modern day compositions rather than hit singles, each one filled with lush harmonies, soaring melodies, and an amalgam of guitars and the endless array of Rick Wakeman's keyboards.<BR>Each musician contributes a bit of genius to each of the monumental scores, which play out like rock concertos. Howe's thoughtful and inventive guitar playing will leave anyone amazed, Jon Anderson's vocals are heartfelt and exploratory, Alan White's drumming is superb, and Chris Squire once again proves the lead like textures that the bass is capable of producing.<BR>Some may accuse this album of being overly self-indulgent, and it may be true in many ways. However, the album is broad enough to show that it is not mindless self-indulgence, but more like convoluted book that one must get into. For those that have a short attention span, steer clear of 'Tales', as it takes much endurance to get through. <BR>Along with &quot;Selling England By the Pound&quot; by Genesis, &quot;Tales&quot; remains a cornerstone of the progressive rock era. It will leave you wondering why current popular music doesn't display this much creativity and artistry.
B000002KB8|5.0|This is the album that started a great era in rock.  Rock God John (Ozzy) Osbourne, guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward made five great songs that started a new era in rock and roll.  This may not be the best cd for beginning listeners to start on.  There is a cd with 34 or so Greatest Songs that has a few songs from this cd.  The greatest songs on this cd are in this order:  1:  Wasp/Behind The Wall Of Sleep/Bassically/N.I.B. because Wasp is a great guitar solo, Behind The Wall Of Sleep is a catchy song, Bassically is a great Bass solo, and N.I.B. is probably the song that gave Ozzy the title of Anti-Christ (although they are wrong in that sense and he has never said he is the antichrist or he has never said that he worships the devel).  2:  The Wizard because the song is such a up-beat song and the guitar/drum/harmonica part in the beginning is possibly the best part of the whole song, I wish they would have done more of that.  3:  Black Sabbath, while being a great song in its own right has lost its fanfare after about a hundred times listening.  4:  Wicked World is a great song in its own right.  5&quot;  A Bit Of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning is a ok song.
B00005JKT8|5.0|Saw the movie today and loved it. Hugh Jackman was wonderfully charming and romantic. Great love story. Highly recomend!
B00005O3VC|4.0|The Extra super special, not just ordinary special, but super special edition is packed with extras to make a python addict drool.  What is most amazing with the DVD is the depth of color that is simply lost on VHS copies of the film.  Having seen the movie any number of times, the difference truly is amazing.  <br />The DVD only loses minor points in the artifacts section shows some reviews that are impossible to read.  Therefore, what's the point.  <br />As to the Lego edition - sheer maniacal brilliance.
B00005QJDG|5.0|This is Dream Theater's best live cd, and probably their best album. This contains all of &quot;Scenes from a Memory,&quot; possibly the greatest prog-metal album, and some great tunes from Awake, Images and Words, and Falling Into Infinity. Jordan Rudess really gets this band going, and he's a veteran of the prog-rock scene. James Labrie never sounded better. He kinda loses his voice near the end of Disc 2, and he also takes the pipes easy on Learning To Live, but he still rocks. Also, the extra Liquid tension Experiment song &quot;Acid Rain&quot; is really really good. I like Jordan's reggae thing in Learning To Live. And, where else are you going to hear The Simpsons theme in a 23 minute song? Also, their anthem, Metropolis Part I, is in this. Really good. Reccomended.
B000002LCK|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have ever listened to.Both discs are great.Temptation is awesome!!Thumbs up!!!!
B00005O892|5.0|THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE.
B00004YA66|4.0|Many others have already summarized the plot of this movie, so I won't bore you with those details.<br />All I'll say is that Frequency contained a few surprises, a lot of heart and solid acting by Dennis Quaid and others. I enjoyed it tremendously -- so much so that I bought the DVD and have watched it three or four times already.<br />Even though the main focus is the relationship between father and son (separated by 30 years since the death of the father), this movie of the heart doesn't shirk on matters of the head. More scientific in its foundation than Field of Dreams (which simply featured a magic cornfield that enabled the living to interact with the dead), Frequency still manages to make the viewer wonder and wish -- and yearn for second chances with lost loved ones.<br />If you like your movies to be intelligent, well-acted and able to employ both your heart and your mind, you could do a lot worse than Frequency. I highly recommend it.<br />If you don't want to take the plunge and outright buy it before you see it, rent it first. However, I think you'll enjoy it enough to want to own it. So just skip the middle step and order it from Amazon today.
0385505833|3.0|While I truly enjoy John Grisham's writing and writing style, I was a bit disappointed by the characters in this novel and the story itself.  I've no doubt that this will be turned into an annual Christmas movie to be played with such favorites as &quot;National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation&quot; or &quot;Scrooged.&quot;  In fact, I can see many resemblances to Chevy Chase's hijinks as the main character, Luther Krank.  Unfortunately, I can't say that I'd want to see the movie.  Maybe it was just my anger toward Luther and his wife, their actions and reactions.  They weren't people I particularly care for.  And their decisions were rather foolish for well-educated people.  In fact, no one in the book was particularly memorable or someone I could identify with or care for.  And, not to spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't read this quick-read book yet, but when the emotion was just starting to build--finally--after a couple hundred pages leading up to it, it quickly died out.  So, while I truly enjoy John Grisham's writing style, I didn't care for this particular story from him.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This is by far the best CD I have! I love it so much!! Every song on the CD is so beautiful, you wont regret buying it! Also makes good music for lyrical dances.
0871137380|5.0|Long story short...this is a must read. To say that Bowden has done his homework on this one is a gross understatement. He does a fantastic job digging up every conceivable printed document about the subject, along with tons of interviews with American military and Somalis involved in the fight. The thing that I really like about the book is that you end up getting multiple accounts from different vantage points and seeing how &quot;the fog of war&quot; can distort people's actions and judgements. I rank this right up there with Andy McNab's &quot;Bravo Two Zero.&quot;
B000000993|5.0|When I first listened to Undertow it was almost ten years ago.  The thing I found most fascinating about Undertow was when the music was over.  I was laying down listening to the tape, and after the music was over I just continued to relax with the intention of letting the tape play out.  A couple of minutes of silence, and all of a sudden you hear crickets singing.  Which begins the most interesting part of the tape.  I wondered how many people might have not even known that there was more to the tape after the main songs have ended.  I've continued to be a fan since.
0790729628|3.0|The first time I saw Bladrunner was at a studio sneak preview in Denver. The film was unfinished, having gaps in the titles, music, and certain scenes. What it lacked was the awful narration that drug down the theatrical edition. I'm sure the studio believed audiences weren't intelligent enough to understand the story, hence the need to add ridiculous explanations. The film also didn't have a happy ending which seemed tacked on, and didn't fit the world as it was portrayed. Yet it was the best version I've seen yet of the film. How many versions have been released to date--6? This version is closest to Scott's original vision and to that first viewing. How many versions will yet come out remains to be seen. Ford is inspired in this futuristic decopauge, showing grit and humanity in an uncertain world. And he is nicely pitted against Rutger Hauer, a villain you can fear and feel for. Forget everything else--this movie is about them.
0800179501|5.0|Ir's true, the Karate Kid is great. this movie really puts it all into perspective. yo yo yo uh uh um uh
B00005QDW1|1.0|Ehhh is good title. I remember back in the day when I got their first self titled CD. That was good stuff... Hell I still listen to that CD a lot. It's ska... but as No Doubt progressed, their music changed. Ska-Alternative-Poppy Rock-Rap? Can we say NO? Why, I felt someone betrayed during Tragic Kingdom, but this? No... that's all I have to say. This CD would be slightly more tolerable if it had been made under &quot;Gwen Stefani&quot; because hey, isn't that the only band member who actually contributed to the CD? We had this issue back during Tragic Kingdom when the band bitched that Gwen was too much in the center. Talk about people who just sit by and let things turn to crap. Word of advice-- listen to maybe one or two clips of the CD. Then you'll see what I'm saying and not waste your money on it
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is one of those very rare movies that can appeal to just about all age levels. Obviously, kids will love it because it is a cartoon, and extremely funny (that's why this adult loves it to!). But there is more to this movie; it is complete role reversal of the classic tale, with the hero being an unaccepted monster, and the heroine hiding a part of her as well. Definitely worth buying, as you'll be sure to watch it at least 3-4 times. Lots of extras on the DVD, as well...
B00005QIPH|5.0|This review is in response to the other reviewers who ramble on and on about how these are just rich kids with connections in the business and have no musical ability.  No matter who The Strokes are, you can't deny their genuine ability to craft a great song.  I'm sure if Guided By Voices had released these songs, the nay-sayers would be raving about the genius of it all (speaking of GBV, this CD comes damn close to Bee Thousand)and if Robert Pollard happened to have a rich daddy who helped him into the business, he wouldn't receive the same acclaim he gets now.  So forget who records their albums in their garage and who records them with unlimited funds; it's just damn good music.<br />1.Is This It - slinky and cool, this song is steady yet relaxed.<br />2.Modern Age - hard to drescribe . . .pure energy.  Casablancas stretches his vocal chords on this one.<br />3.Soma - Could have been on &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot;.<br />4.Barely Legal -  really catchy melodies in this one.  What make The Strokes different is that their melodies and harmonies arn't bubble-gummy.  I can't even think of anyone to compare them with.<br />5.Someday - One of the best songs I've ever heard.  After hearing this, you won't want to hear any other song . . .ever.     <br />The first five tracks alone are worth the whole price of the album.  In conclusion, while listening to The Strokes you'll keep asking yourself &quot;havn't I heard that before&quot;.  They have a familiar sound (nothing like the Velvet Underground) that is timeless.  There are a few things in each song that might not sound right, but that's what makes them great; they're not sitting in the studio, hunched over their instruments, making sure everything is perfect; they attain perfection from not caring....like The Stooges or The New York Dolls.  The Strokes are the fore-runners of modern &quot;sloppy rock.&quot;  This Is It.
B00005OB0A|5.0|I heard the single Can't Get You Out Of My Head on the radio and fell in love with it immediately. I downloaded a few of her other songs and decided to buy her album. I was not expecting it to be so good! <br />More More More-The first track is okay, but it lacks something, at least to me. Grade: B-<br />Love At First Sight-The second track is fantastic. It's the second song I downloaded. It has a catchy beat, beautiful chorus, and a wonderful guitar riff playing throughout it. It is one you can tap your toe to and sing along with. Grade: A+<br />Can't Get You Out Of My Head-The first single, and a stand-out track. It mixes disco with new-age techno for a very unique sound. The lyrics are painfully simple, but the melody saves this song. Grade: A<br />Fever-The title track is another good song. I don't really know what to say about this song. It's just a fun track. Grade: A-<br />Give It To Me-Most people don't like this song, but I personally like it. It has a good beat and has cool sounds throughout it. Grade: B+<br />Fragile-This song blew me away. Quiet (compared to the other tracks, at least) and sad, with a great tune. Grade: A+<br />Come Into My World-Wow. Kylie gives it her all in this song. The song is catchy, and Kylie's vocals stand out. This song shows off Kylie's voice without alot of vocoders. Grade: A+<br />In Your Eyes-The second single, one that is liked alot by most, but this song doesn't do much for me. It's alright. Grade: B-<br />Dancefloor-This song is pure disco, and the music and lyrics are good. Grade: A-<br />Love Affair-Great beat, great music, great lyrics, great vocals by Kylie, great song. Grade: A+<br />Your Love-Like Fragile, this is another lovely, calm song. The whole song is beautiful. Grade: A+<br />Burning Up-Repetitive, yet striking. Grade: A-<br />All in all, this CD is fantastic. Who knew the Locomotion girl would have such a great comeback?
B00004W3MS|5.0|This album is the most inspiring album that I have ever listened to. I bought the album only for Ný Batterý but when I played the album from start to finish my jaw just hit the floor, I was so amazed by the inhuman vocals and the blistering power of the bow on the guitar. You can't define this music, the only thing that you can do is listen and make your mind take you to a higher plane, a different world where you just fly through the clouds and valleys of rivers and green grass. <br />Sigur Rós is my favorite band and Sigur Rós will be my favorite band for a long time if not forever.
B00002MZ4V|1.0|Enjoy John Williams Greatest Hit! You Start out with the Star Wars theme, move onto the Star Wars theme, change CDs and you launch yourself immediately into the Star Wars theme. It's pretty sickening stuff, you'll feel your bile rising sooner or later, if you can last the official Star Wars theme finishes then seconds later you'll probably just want to keel over. It's the audio-equivalent of being force-fed fat handfuls chocolate for two staight hours. It's fun at first but after a few minutes you want nothing more than to vomit copious amounts of thick, oily brown bile all over John Williams and his One Magic Tune. His music is much like chocolate; pretty much any one can enjoy it with no trouble, but try making a fulfilling meal out of the stuff. So TWO CDs of it? I'd rather straddle a chain-link fence, thanks, John. MTFBWU!
B000051VWW|5.0|This is not a typical Sade album.  If you are looking for glimpses of Diamond Life, Promise, Love Deluxe or any of the previous releases, you are going to be disappointed.  Sade is truly speaking with her heart and mind with this release.  This release is more featuring Sade Adu herself more so than the band.  The songs are so beautiful and touching its almost scary.  &quot;King Of Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart&quot;, &quot;Immigrant&quot;, &quot;By Your Side&quot; and &quot;All About Our Love&quot; are all wonderful tracks.  But the song that truly stands out above the others is &quot;It's Only Love That Gets You Through&quot;.  Done simply with a haunting organ, this track tugs at your emotions and faith so deeply that you may  be in tears before the track is over.  This album is truly a listener's gem.  It focuses on the lyrical content.  I felt as if she was speaking to me personally.  As you look at most of the reviews, there are a lot of mixed opinions so beware and take heed to the warning I gave earlier in the review.  This album is truly for a mature ear.  Much respect to Sade for having fortitude to come back after her 8 year hiatus and challenge new fans as well as her old fans with music at a new level.  ABSOLUTELY STELLAR WORK!!
B00005HUYC|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the greatest live guitar performances out there. What is so remarkable is the diversity that each player has and brings to the stage. Paco plays his famous flamenco, di meola competes with his recognizable phrasing and technique, and mclaughin, well, this is probably the most open-hearted playing I've ever heard from one of the greatest abstract guitarists. Musicians adore this CD (especially guitarists), and others also have that fire for this kind of music. But, this album is, beyond a doubt, one of the most signifigant pieces of work for all 3 players and for the great music they represent. An absolute must.
B00003CX96|5.0|This film is great-see it and remind yourself what it used to be like to see good stories and characters.<br />Why are these great pre-DVD films being released in the format without extras?  For Breaking Away a screenwriter's commentary would be good.<br />It would be great to see fun stuff from the 70's put on DVD with some extras.  Burt Renold's  &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; and &quot;Hooper&quot; come to mind, with extras like how they did all the stunts and stuff.
B000002H97|5.0|I just recently started listening to Metallica.  At first I didn't think i'd like it, but (moms) IT'S MORE THAN JUST NOISE!!!  Of the few Metallica cd's I have so far, this is my fave.  #4, The Unforgiven is the best song on the cd!  It's slower than most of the other songs and has an awesome sound.  If you're new on Metallica and can't decide which one to make your first Metallica cd, I'd suggest this one.  Reload is also a good one.  Personally, I don't really like their early stuff.  That's why I like this cd so much, because its a lot more mature.
B00005Q45W|4.0|I was hooked on LC when given a copy of 'I'm your Man' in the '80's.  I knew 7 of the 8 songs by heart, with the exception of 'I Can't Forget,' which I didn't care for at the time (took me over 15 years before it grew on me).  Among my favorites were the powerful 'First We'll Take Manhattan,' 'Everybody Knows,', and 'Tower of Song.'<BR>I was delighted when 'The Future' came out, hoping for more like the 3 mentioned above from IYM.  I found the song 'The Future' itself to have that same powerful quality in both a dynamic beat and powerful lyrics, closest to 'First We Take Manhattan.'  While the rest of the songs did not make as much as an impression of genius on me, they are still much endeared and stand out as Cohen the powerhouse.<BR>Next comes 'Ten New Songs,' which I rushed to buy on the first day.  First I listened to the opening of each track, and found each song to be as mellow and soft as the one before it.  No 'Manhattan,' 'Everybody Knows,' 'Future...' or songs of such force.  This, at first, had me disappointed.<BR>I took the CD with me to work where I listen on auto repeat.  And while I still hardly know the lyrics of any of the songs, and still find myself looking to see which track is playing so I can match it to the song title, I notice that as a whole the album is extremely relaxing and soothing.  One soft song blends into another to create a hypnotizing effect.<BR>So, if you are at the end of your rope and one step away from pulling out the razor blades, listen to 'I'm Your Man,' and 'The Future.'<BR>If you're at work or just alone and want to hear a good friend in the background while bringing down your blood pressure, listen to 'Ten New Songs.'
B00005O3VD|4.0|The picture and sound on this dvd are great. The colors are vibrant and every song feels like you are right in front of a Broadway orchestra.The extras are nice but there should have been more. The cover art is nice too.
B00000J7JO|5.0|speaking as a really loud person, i was really blown away by this album, i went speechless.  thats the only way i can explain it. every song is a gem in its own way.  some funkiness, some grace.  yea, call it angry in a graceful way. it is beauty. i love all the songs, but if i were to choose three favorites, theyd be scar tissue, otherside, and this velvet glove.  even if you are not a vibrant fan of the peppers i still think you should listen to this album, because the peppers are far more complex than radio hits suggest.
0060934913|5.0|Without question this is the first book that truly explains what degenerates that cooks truly are.  As a 15 year veteran of many kitchens, I can honestly say that Bourdain has nailed what many of us always knew, cooks rule.  As Bourdain described the cooks of the dreadnaught, where I worked by the way....not the dreadnaught, but a kitchen damn near the exact same....\\"They drank everything in sight, stole anything that wasn't nailed down [...] <br />God help me, but that's us.<br />Cooks rule.
0385505833|1.0|Grisham is a strong brand, nicely demonstrated by the fact that hundreds of thousands of suckers, myself included, rushed to buy this thin story hoping for another Grisham pageturner.<br />Do we keep the faith and buy &quot;The Summons&quot; after this deeply disappointing offering??
630588255X|5.0|This coming from someone who only recently discovered H&amp;M, I probably don't have much to add to the praise. With all the over-the-top special effects that pollute films today, the unassuming quiet simplicity of this eccentric little film is a breath of fresh air. The love story was very sweet; the concentrated shot of positivity very uplifting. These points make the film commendable; what makes the film incredible is the atmosphere it creates - audio visual candy. You don't even need to follow the plot to appreciate the pure art that it is. Calm beautiful images juxtaposed against calm beautiful music. The two meld to create a new beast of sensory awe on a level beyond storyline. And there's just something about Harold's voice that's really mesmerizing - indescribable, save for A Poem. It's so soft and slight - like the balm of summer's breeze across my face.
B00003CY5K|3.0|As &quot;achievement&quot; movies go, this one was barely credible.  The star keeps referring to people only treating her as &quot;a blonde with big boobs.&quot;  Well, her boobs were not that big- but she WAS a blonde.  To think that she could change her personality and education level so quickly to pass the LSAT's, well ... you'd have to be blonde to like this show I suppose.  ;)
B000002BFL|4.0|Here's the thing. I just finished reading &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; for the first time a few weeks back. I know, I know. How can a middle-aged, first time novelist (&quot;The Legacy&quot;, Savage Press, 2000)just now be reading classic American works like Hemingway, Steinbeck and Faulkner? Just getting around to it, I guess. In any event, I was so captivated by the novel, and I remembered The Boss had an album titled after Tom Joad, I thought, &quot;what the heck, why not give it a try?&quot; Being from Duluth, Minnesota's inland port and gateway to the Iron Range, of course I heard &quot;Youngstown&quot; when it came out in 1995. I had forgotten just how great a tune it is. The rest of the album, including &quot;Tom Joad&quot; is good, not spectacular (hence the four stars and not five). Nebraska it isn't...but I think songwriters, like authors, only get one of those in a career.<BR>A solid, solid effort, not at all simply the musings of a &quot;rich spoiled rock star pretending to be poor.&quot;
0385505833|5.0|Must admit this is my first Grisham read so I cannot compare it to any of his other writing.<br />I found this to be a good book and one that I will surely read again.<br />The holidays can be so nerve-racking that the thought of skipping it all could be very exciting.<br />After reading this book you will not look at the holiday festivities the same nor will you be able to look at a plastic frosty the snowman without thinking of this story.<br />This is a good read no matter what time of the year it is.
0783221622|5.0|It's Frank Vincent.  Yes, they look similar, but it's not Dennis.  Actually, I think Frank is better.
B00005U122|5.0|I saw roger waters on this tour and this dvd<BR>has excellent sound.he and the band are superb.
B000000HXK|5.0|once in a while, a CD comes along that will change the way one looks at music...the way one feels about music...and definitely, the way one appreciates musical soundcsapes.  Hex by the late Bark Psychosis is without a doubt one of the most amazing collections music that will ever grace your auditory senses.  weaving guitars...scattered drum beats that keep an eccentric rhythm...punctuating, yet smooth, rolling piano...and mellow dramatic, breathy vocals that gently flow throughout.  i must admit, at first, i didn't know what to expect.  but after the first listen, i was hooked.  i'm into mellow, chilly, and trippy kickin' stuff, and Hex delivers.  amazing to think this music was recorded back in the early nineties.  each track could be released today, and it would still feel like something new is about to explode.  what a gem of a find....simply start with cover and get lost in the astral glow in the night sky, then push play, and enjoy.  if you're a fan of Cocteau...you're in.  a fan of Eno?  not a problem.  dig a little Talk Talk?  that'll help.  even if you like Sneaker Pimps, Hex by Bark Psychosis will hold permanent residence in your CD player at home, in your car, and in your computer at work.  <br />Pick one up for yourself, then pick one up for a friend...It's a great Hex to be under.<br />Peace
6305364613|5.0|Audacious, sexy, thrilling and beautiful, this film takes Shakespeare's classic and spills it into the wonderfully ribald world of Verona Beach, Miami. The Montagues and the Capulets are at war, and Romeo and Juliet are caught in the crossfire. They love each other, but can't be together because of the circumstances. It's tragedy at it's best, and this film does nothing to detract from that.<br />Some may scoff at the fast pace, but no one can deny the affecting performances given by Leonardo DiCaprio (incredible as Romeo- he gives the role dark emotional weight, while keeping the inner core of boyishness, humour and sexiness), Claire Danes, who is meltingly lovely as Juliet- and witty as well, which is refreshing. Pete Postelwaite is dryly fantastic as the Priest and Harold Perrineau gives the role of Mercutio all he has and more. <br />Verona Beach, with all it's souped up cars, guns and Hawaiian shirts, is a world that Shakespeare himself could never have envisioned, but I believe, wouldn't have him spinning in his grave. He lived to entertain -- Mercutio as a cross-dresser and Romeo popping acid aren't as far from Shakespeare's vision as some might think.<br />I reccommend this film to anyone who wants a thrill ride through love, death, tears, vengeance- and a foray into the tortured world of Romeo and Juliet's love, which touched everyone they knew, in one way or another.
6303159966|5.0|2 people trapped inside a small car...trapped in the <BR>middle of nowhere...a large,rabid dog around...these are<BR>great elements that make a great horror film!You never know <BR>when Cujo will suddenly appear in a frothing,mad fury.A must have for any horror film collection!
B00003CXDU|4.0|I was expecting this movie to be rather bad.  Just when I was beginning to think renting this film was a horrible mistake, Tim Allen's character encounters real aliens.  The real fun and real hilarity begin here.  The jokes had my boyfriend and I giggling for days.  The special affects are good and there's plenty of action. <br />The only down side to this film are the appearances of the pig monster and the alien enemy. The pig monster looks exactly like what it is--a man in costume.  The enemy looked like a variant of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  In contrast, the baby aliens (obviously computer generated) were fabulous.  Both their look and their movements were superb.  Fortunately, the appearance of the pig monster is brief and it doesn't take much from the overall feel of the film.  I was able to thoroughly enjoy the movie and would love to see it again.  If you like comedies and you like Star Trek, you're sure to like this film.
6304698623|5.0|This movie was amazing.  I was at home on winter break from college when I saw it on TV.  I watched it because I had nothing to do, but I have to say it was one of the best movies ever.  I'll admit it, it is the first time since I was a really small boy and saw 'my girl' that I have almost shed a tear while watching a movie.  I suggest purchasing two copies of this movie in case one copy becomes scratched when you want to watch it.  I also suggest purchasing Haagan Daaz ice cream to intensify the movie watching experience.  Watch this movie and then email me, we will discuss, kleenex in hand.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I first noticed her from the lady marmulade video. Then I heard her song &quot;get the party started&quot; on television. I decided to take a chance and buy the cd. She is a very talented woman. She is in the same catagory as Dido,Alicia Keys, and Gwen Stefani. Her songs are very different from each other. She has Jazz, rock, blues, pop and hip hop! Something for everyone! Don't just look at her for her pink hair because there is so much more there!!I think you will enjoy alot of these songs! Look out Britney Spears!!!
0684853523|5.0|Make me feel, make me look forward to his next book, and inspire me to write.<br />Towards the end of my college English 2 course, I purchased this book to assist with my final essay. I already use the MLA guidebooks, and Strunk and White's &quot;Elements of Style&quot;.<br />I thought, hmmmmmm, what author does for me what I want to do for others? Why Stephen King!!! <br />Reading this book goes beyond how to write. It gives you HOPE. The more I write the more difficult it has gotten. I expect a great deal more of myself and have begun to fall short in the art of style. The examples and explanations in this book are real life. They are not intimidating in the least, but instead sets the tone as casual, and often times I felt like he was writing the book just for me.<br />I have to also include his jovial review of the event of 1999 that almost rid us of this gifted writer. I cannot imagine anyone but Stephen King adding humor--I burst out laughing (Marzes-bars, lol)--to such a life-altering event as the van incident. I must agree that this incident really did seem like Stephen King was propelled into one of his novels...<br />Stephen King is THE MAN. If you think you don't like him or his books...then FUHGEDDABOUDIT! (inside joke, lol)<br />I do, however, challenge to you change your opinion by reading this book.<br />:-)
B00005O5CM|4.0|This definitely was not a bad movie.  Although predictable and cheesy at times, I thought the underlying theme of believing in oneself came thru nicely.  In this story, Elle seems to be the stereotypical ditzy blonde, but despite her sunny Valley-girlishness is very bright and is burdened by being too pretty to be taken seriously.  She makes matters worse for herself and follows a snobbish ex across the country after being dumped for being less than the debutante he thinks he deserves.  But, she realized early on that no matter what she did, he would never appreciate her and gave up on him but never gave up on herself.  The only down side to the movie is it's overly sweet at times (enough to give you a toothache!).
B00005NSWI|5.0|For those who think that jazz is boring, they are so, so wrong! Brown, McBride & Clayton make their big old instruments sound like a big band. Check out their happening, bass-slapping piece \\"Papa was a Rolling Stone\\" (Oh Wow! How could this be jazz! Woohoo!), and \\"Mysterioso\\" where the 3 stars make a beautiful classical sound out of it. Those who have heard Thelonius Monk & Sonny Rollins in \\"Mysterioso\\" will know what I mean! This 'live' recording makes the humble instrument come loud & alive. Woohoo! It's definitely an album worth investing in!
B00000AFWZ|5.0|I just turned 40 this year and have the vaguest memories of some of the magical songs that appear on this four volume set. Thank you, Rhino, for bringing me back to life! I was a child in the 60's and remember that my brother had his own band. Yeah, they used to knock out a good many of these numbers in our garage and all the young mommies would come pounding at our door screaming for them to stop. &quot;Your waking my baby, you young punks!&quot;Aaah..the good old days. <br />I'm actually very gratified that so much has been written recently on this &quot;lost&quot; era of American music...the garage band sound of the mid-60's. Whenever the topic of 60's music is discussed, I hear tons of analysis about folk-rock, psychadelic, soul, heavy metal, and the Britsh Invasion. Very little is ever discussed about the garage bands, although they were arguably the major influence behind the late 70's and early 80's punk revolution. In fact, I think it's fair to say that the garage band sound was as huge an influence on white suburban kids as street corner singing and &quot;Doo-Wop&quot; was to the urban youth of the 50's. I'll just give some brief praise to my favorites:<br />&quot;Dirty Water&quot; by The Standells - I'm gonna tell you a story, baby...this is the greatest rock n' roll song EVER!<br />&quot;Moulty&quot; by The Barbarians - An absolute riot! The Massachusetts-born vocalist sounds like a Kennedy and drums with a hook on one of his hands. You can't get more punky than that.<br />&quot;Psychotic Reaction&quot; by The Count Five - Proof that even an obscure and fairly untalented band can have a few minutes of pure genius.<br />&quot;Farmer John&quot; by The Premiers - A high energy song that features phony crowd noises. You gotta love it!<br />&quot;Fight Fire&quot; by The Golliwogs - Only about a million times better than any of the run-of-the-mill crap they put out as Creedence Clearwater Revival. <br />&quot;Beg, Borrow and Steal&quot; by The Rare Breed - If you think &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; sounds like &quot;He's So Fine&quot;, wait till you hear how much this sounds like &quot;Louie, Louie.&quot; At least they stole from the best.<br />&quot;Sometimes Good Guys Don't Wear White&quot; by The Standells - Another masterpiece from the greatest of all the garage bands.<br />&quot;Who Do You Love?&quot; by The Woolies - Excellent version of a timeless classic.<br />&quot;I Want Candy&quot; by The Strangeloves - Good to hear the original version again. Still the best!<br />&quot;Louie, Louie&quot; by the Kingsmen - No words needed. The grandaddy of them all. <br />&quot;What Am I Going To Do?&quot; by The Dovers - Everything a great love song should be. Delivered with passion and soul.<br />&quot;Open Up Your Door&quot; by Richard &amp; The Young Lions - Sounds like the Beatles singing &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;.<br />&quot;Hold Me Now&quot; by The Rumors - The absolute best song on this great album. Who are they and where did they go? <br />The album also includes some great psychadelic tunes such as &quot;Liar, Liar&quot;, &quot;Journey to the Center of the Mind&quot;, &quot;I Had Too Much to Dream last Night&quot;, Mindrocker&quot; and, of course, &quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot;. The only small criticism I have is that there should have been some stronger selections by Paul Revere and the Raiders. How about &quot;Louie Go Home&quot;, &quot;Kicks&quot; or &quot;Hungry&quot;? Also,The Troggs classic, &quot;With a Girl Like You&quot; would have been nice. That was usually the one that woke the babies.
B00005QDW5|4.0|If you are a true Floyd fan, you will love the selections they chose.  I'll admit, they missed a few of my favorites, but all in all, it is a wonderful CD.  Pink Floyd was always able to hit the nail on the head..  &quot;When Tigers Broke Free&quot;, is still a tearful favorite of mine.  I can't believe they waited so long to create this CD.  It is well worth your time!!!<BR>(i would have given a 5...but like i said, they missed a couple other good songs...hope there will be &quot;Echoes,pt2&quot;)
B000002UCN|5.0|Whatever quibbles anyone else may have, this is surely pretty close to George's &quot;greatest&quot; for the time period in question.  For the subsequent years, you'll have to track down an out of print copy of &quot;The Best of Dark Horse 1976-1989,&quot; which is basically the second volume of George's greatest hits.  Hopefully it will be reissued in light of his death (or at least the gems it contains will be included in a boxed set).  I've never understood how anyone could regard George as a &quot;second tier&quot; Beatle.  While I'm a fan of all the former Beatles, George's solo work seems to me to be more clearly on a par with the best of The Beatles than either John's or Paul's.  I guess we'll never really know exactly who contributed what to The Beatles' magic, but the spirituality, quirky humor and musical sense in George's solo work seem to me to best capture what The Beatles were all about.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I think every song is excellent on this cd, but: there are some songs in the beatle catalogue that are better than some of the songs included here. For instance, if you ask any beatle fan, would agree that STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER, WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE, and stuff like that are better than SHE LOVES YOU, ETC. (FIRST ONES ARE SONGS WITH A MEANING, WITH FEELINGS, ART, AND THE SECOND IS JUST AN EASY LISTENING SONG THAT SOME GROUP COULD DO IT), BUT, BECASUE OF ITS TIME(WERENT RELEASED IN BEATLEMANIA), DID NOT REACH NUMBER 1, WHILE SOME SONGS BECAUSE WERE RELEASED IN BEATLEMANIA REACHED NUMBER ONE, SO THEY COULD NOT BE INCLUDED HERE BECAUSE IT WAS A CONCEPT ALBUM: IT IS MORE COMERCIAL TO RELEASE A COLLECTION OF NUMBER ONES THAN A COLLECTION OF BEATLE SONGS, NOT NECESARLY NUMBER ONES BUT WITH MEANING.- THE PHOTOS ARE GREAT, BUT I WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT THE LYRICS WERE INCLUDED. CAUSE IM YOUNG I HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO LISTEN TO THE ORIGINAL MONO, I JUST DREAM OF IT.
B00003CXDD|5.0|i love fairy tales and other folk stories, so it is no surprise that i would enjoy this fantasy film. i believe it to be one of the best of the genre ever made -- the sets, costumes and natural landcapes evoke a sense of history, and in this way connect the narrative to our own world. the script is accessible enough for a general audience, without pandering, and the cast is fully engaged in their various roles. the classic struggle between good and evil is given little twists, and surprise/expectation are flirtaciously played with. now that the lord of the rings is out i hope that fantasy will begin to gain a wider, more loyal audience -- it is nice to see that not all films of this type must be \\"dumbed down\\" to the conan level. the great fantasy classics, in my opinion, are \\"the dark crystal,\\" \\"labyrinth,\\" \\"the neverending story\\" (part I), \\"willow,\\" \\"the lord of the rings,\\" \\"legend,\\" \\"snow white: a tale of terror\\" with siguorney weaver, and the first installment of the \\"highlander\\" movies. i would disagree with those who claim that fantasy films are simply excursions into daydreaming -- i believe that they do speak to moral responsibility, and thus cannot be written off as simple tales with no social/intellectual weight. the purpose of the tale is to teach us what we should know about social interactions, or remind us of what we already knew but had forgotten in our mad rush of modern living: be kind, be honest, and never stop believing in the power of goodness.
B00003CXTF|5.0|This is my FAVORITE movie ever. I don't know why some people give it bad reviews, I guess it's not their type of movie. But I can honestly say this movie is AMAZING. The story line is VERY accurate and has a GREAT point to it. It's worth every minute of your time. Comedy/Romance/Action and Drama all in 1~! A MUST SEE FOR ALL!
B000002WUD|3.0|This is a great,great box(personal favourit),but there's one thing(few songs,I'd say)that's missing...<BR>So what's wrong here?<BR>Well,If you love the song ''Sylvia'' as much as I do,don't get to excited...It isn't there. It's beautiful and,may I say,much much better than the live vers of ''Suspicious Minds''(which you can find on ''Aloha'' cd)...<BR>''When I'm over you''- my god, I could not believe that they didn't put that...Not to mention songs like:''Never Ever''(great one,believe you me),''Bitter They Are Harder They Fall'', SPANISH EYES(can you believe it??!?!?)<BR>And What about ''If you love me ,Let me know'',that Elvis loved so much(I couldn't find a good version of this song) or ''If you don't come back''(If you love ''Aloha'' version of ''Fever'',you'd like this song even better...he's singing it<BR> sooo coool)...<BR>Great music,The Greatest performer ever...BUY IT<BR>10 STARS FOR THE STUFF!!!!!!
B00005JKES|1.0|As a long-time fan of Twin Peaks I could hardly wait to own the series on DVD...until I *bought* the DVD. As a result I must add my voice to the myriad other complaints in the same vein and ask, what's the point? Why bother putting this outstanding series in a nice new expensive package - and still, after all this time, not include the pilot episode?<BR>If you've never seen Twin Peaks (or even if you *have* seen it) there's something seriously wrong with starting from episode two, primarily that you're missing out on the entire first two hours or so which lay the groundwork for the rest of the series. By excluding the pilot I fail to see how this can be acurately labelled as 'The Complete First Season.'<BR>Save your money, and your time, and wait until someone can be troubled to release a truly 'complete' version...
031286504X|4.0|WOW - I really wish Mr. Matheson had written a longer version of I Am Legend, because this was one of the best 160 pages I've ever read.  An extremely compelling story that I wanted to continue for another 100 pages (at least!!).  I loved the little twist he threw in concerning one of the characters, as well as how the novel ended.  Mr. Matheson had the guts to end the story in a way that many novelists would never dream of.  And as a nice bonus, I loved his shorter stories - violent, grotesque, engaging with Twilight Zone type endings.<br />I look forward to reading Hell House and other Matheson stories, and I hope and pray that Hollywood does I Am Legend justice when it comes again to the big screen.  Thanks for a great read!!
B000002JK2|5.0|One of the classic albums that makes you feel good every time you hear it.  Wonderful interplay of creative forces.
B0000004V2|5.0|All personal enthusiasm aside, this is the only album I can honestly recommend to anyone regardless of her/his musical taste. No album could have more universal appeal IMO. Ironic considering it's relegated to mere &quot;cult&quot; status in the U.S. The Roses' style embraces the classic melodies of the variety that have allowed the Beatles to endure as the most widely loved band of the rock and roll era, while at the same time showcasing a certifiable guitar hero, undoubtably rock's greatest attraction and one the mighty Beatles actually did not have (one never confuses George Harrison with Jimmy Page). Most importantly, the Roses modernized their classic influences, taking rock out to the rave culture that was so popular on the British Isles in the late 80's. In fact, this album has made its most lasting mark from this unification of rock and dance in both rhythm (though somewhat understated) and spirit. Also gratifying is the fact that the album plays the part of the masterpiece with the full intention of being one, complete with a slow rising epic introduction in Adored, ambitious studio wizardry perhaps best exemplified in Don't Stop (Waterfall backwards), hushed theatrics found in This Is The One, the psychedelic, raved up 9 minute jamfest climax of I Am The Resurrection, and even a chilled, funked-out denoument in Fool's Gold. <br />All in all, this album transcends personal taste. People are predisposed to enjoy humming to an irresistable melody, bobbing their heads to a catchy beat, or doing a little air guitar. Thus, everyone is predisposed to LOVE this album. It may take a couple of spins for the record's worthiness of its infinite hype to be revealed, but trust me, it will. This is the surest bet of any CD purchase you could ever make. Buy it and enjoy!
B000002WPI|5.0|When Staten Island's Wu-Tang Clan burst on the scene, the power base of hip-hop appeared to have shifted to the Left (read: West) Coast led by the likes of Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg.  Although the birthplace of the hip-hop art form, New York seemed to lack direction, issuing the occasional (and increasingly infrequent) hit.  However, &quot;Protect Ya Neck&quot; quickly altered the landscape once more.  Fierce and unrelenting in its sonic assault, &quot;Enter The 36 Chambers&quot; delivered on the promise of the lead single and went straight for the jugular without reservation.  With simple, but effective production, one-time Tommy Boy artist Prince Rakeem (aka RZA) devised a musical context where the rest of the Clan could vent their desperation and thirst to scale the summit.  Driven by classics such as &quot;C.R.E.A.M.&quot; (featuring a Charmels sample), the Clan have never sounded as hungry since nor has Ol' Dirty Bastard been as cogent on the mic...

B00003CXXJ|5.0|The first time I saw Shrek, I thought that it would be another kid movie. Boy was I wrong! This is the first DVD that I have purchased and there is a reason for that. This movie is funny, graphically stunning and full of adventure and bellyache laughs! You can't go wrong with the star-studded cast. I have watched Shrek many times and have not grown tired of it. Now, I will enjoy it on my new DVD player. Because I'm a believer too!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|A movie with a soul. It is honest, sensitive, raw, and wonderfully entertaining drama. I didn't see this film in the theater. I rented it, then bought it. This movie transcends your typical teenage rock movie by documenting the loss of innocence - both of the main character, William Miller (brilliantly under played by newcomer Patrick Fugit) and the music industry as a whole. Miller discovers the world of rock from listening to his older sister's albums and through circumstances ends up on an assignment for Creem magazine to write an article on Black Sabbath. When he tries to gain entrance backstage to do the story, he ends up meeting band aid (NOT groupie) Penny Lane (played by Kate Hudson) and his life changes. Instead of meeting Black Sabbath, he falls in with one of their opening acts, a fictitious band called Stillwater, and Miller's early career as a writer takes off. Penny Lane befriends the young Miller and is his guide into the world of rock and roll. <br />The achievement of this film is it manages to show the drugs and sex, the emptiness, and shallowness of the music industry without making the viewer lose fascination or obsession with its stars and glamour. The people are human, talented, affected, and driven. That's where the film so gloriously succeeds. As Miller follows Stillwater on their Almost Famous Tour on assignment for Rolling Stone magazine, we see him fall in love and get used, and he just keeps coming out of the trenches to face more because in the end - every one is in it for the music and living for the moment. Some of the most magical moments in the film are between Patrick Fugit and Kate Hudson, Patrick Fugit and Billy Crudup, and Patrick Fugit and Frances McDormand. I find it hard to imagine all the attention heaped on McDormand and Hudson to the exclusion of Fugit. While the ensemble cast in this film is one of the best ever assembled (Altman eat your heart out), Fugit and director Crowe are the glue that hold this movie together and make it what promises to be one of the most enduring films ever made. Not to mention Academy Award winner Anna Pacquin and Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Oscar-worthy roles. And Jason Lee proved in this film that he should never go back to skateboarding. Ever.<br />Guitarist Peter Frampton was a technical consultant on this film, and Nancy Wilson (Mrs. Cameron Crowe) formerly of \\"Heart\\" wrote the score for Almost Famous. Cameron Crowe said as he was accepting the Academy Award for best original screenplay for Almost Famous that the film was his love letter to the music industry. I just hope he sends a few more their way. Or ours. This movie proves he doesn't have to take a back seat to Harper Lee as long as he stays honest. The more we see of Crowe in his work and the less of Cruise the better. If dipping into his own experiences yields this kind of entertainment, I hope the well never runs dry. In Almost Famous, he bared his soul and created a cinema masterpiece that captures more about the human spirit than anything put on celluloid in two decades.<br />And a footnote on the Director's Bootleg cut. Spring for the extra $$$ and buy it. The longer \\"Untitled\\" version gives you more of Fugit and Philip Seymore Hoffman. While the extra footage does slow the pace of the film a bit, for those who don't have problems paying attention, what you get is a layer of character depth - and ambience that you didn't get in the theatrical version. Penny Lane's birthday scene, a longer speech from the unscrupulous manager, and more talks between William and Lester. Undulge yourself. Almost Famous isn't about instant gratification. This film is about savoring characters and stories set on a backdrop tapestry of rock posters, black lights, album covers, and back stages as rich as any work of art ever produced. This is American cinema with a passion and at its very best.

I got her last CD &quot;OOPS I did it Again&quot;....&quot;because I liked the LUCKY song! Turned out I got hooked on Britney!I recently started working out and running, so I'd seen Brits &quot;Live  in Las Vegas&quot; show &amp; figured..thats Gotta be good music to workout too!! Well I was right!! I absolutely LOVE all this CD! ITS Really HOT! Great Beat, and I like the song lyrics/what they mean! I'm Glad she did the &quot;Im not a Girl, Not yet a woman&quot;... My favorite song on there is &quot;Overprotected&quot; and the song I skip is: &quot;I Love ROck n ROll&quot;...that song is better left to &quot;Joan Jett&quot;.... But for the Most of it... I love this CD.....If you wanna Dance, and YOu wannnna Move! Or just plain sing in your car! Or in the Bathroom doing your makeup!This is your CD!!

B00003CXFV|1.0|This is basically a movie of the week,except for the presence of Julia Roberts.This movie,like any Hollywood production doesn't bother with the facts,only with what makes drama and pulls at the heartstrings.This movie is more fairy tale than anything and paints one side(Brokovich and her lawyers)as the &quot;Good guys&quot; and the Gas company as the BIG&lt;EVIL monster.Go to Fumento.com for a few real facts on the case.First of all it has never been established that Chromium 6(supposedly the cause of Hinckley residents illnesses)is a toxic agent except when inhaled.But laywers knew that a 30 billion dollar corporation would make a rich target.So they set out to find as many sick people as they could find,and lo and behold,with a few town meetings and intentional playing around with facts and manipulating peolple's fear you had a movement with momentum.Eventually,PG&amp;E settled for $333 million,and of course the lawyers got a nice,fat sum for themselves(40%).Some of the plaintifs still haven't received any money.Of course during the trial,just like in this movie,facts never got in the way of a good victimology,good vs. evil story.With a society so despicably deficient in science it only makes sense that rackets like this could be carried out.By the way Brockovich and team have tried to pull their shenanigans elsewhere with little success.Second note:When news outlets went and interviewed residents of Hinckley the general consensus was that the only factual part of the movie was the name of the lawyer! All in all, a wretched,exploitative and shameful movie.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|This movie is an overdose on eye candy and pop hedonism.  The plot is vapid to non-existent, and if what you are looking for is a two hour excursion into hell, this is it.  The performances are truly outstanding, the set design and cinematography is stunning, and Jim Broadbent turns in his usual staggering great performance.  But hearing Ewan McGregor butcher Elton John and Rogers and Hammerstein, and dwarves running around with lisps over and over again is more than the average person can take.  Taken separately, many of the elements of this film are an achievement - colorful to be sure -and very, very red.  But it failed to hook, primarily because it failed to make me care or hold my attention.  If this is the best Hollywood can do with the musical as an art form, then I hope it stays dead a little while longer.  I'll take Cabaret or the Sound of Music over this any day.  If you want to see Nicole Kidman in a great performance, see the Others.  I bought this after seeing the Golden Globe nominations.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  If there were a sequel to Dante's Inferno, the director of Moulin Rouge would be chained to a rock for all eternity and made to listen Ewan McGregor sing &quot;Your Song&quot; non-stop for all eternity ...with Kidman just out of reach.
B00005PJ8I|3.0|This movie strives to give some profound message but aside from a few platitudes and the Fed Ex placement ads I can't figure out what it is.There are some poignant moments when Tom Hanks'character is on the deserted island with his only friend,a volleyball courtesy of a fed ex package.After 4 years Hanks character manages to piece together a raft and drifts until a ship spots him and picks him up.Back in civilization you expect the character to experience an epiphany of some sort but nothing happens.This movie tried too hard to be earnest but really had nothing to say.Ambitious yes,but a very disappointing movie.
0380973650|5.0|If the _Grifters_ and _Glory Road_ had somehow been recombined in the uterus of a drunk goat (a mad scientist as the progenitor, or perhaps one of those conversational AIs on steroids was fed the text to the two books as source material), _American Gods_ would have been the result.  Maybe.  Maybe Gaiman is just a schozophrenic channeler, an auto-writer possessed by two shades.  Whatever, he is a genius, and _American Gods_ is a work of genius.<br />The thing about _American Gods_ is that it ISN'T Gaiman's best book.  It is his most ambitious, his most accepted by the sci-fi literati, and it came out in hardcover, so it is cool to talk about it and be seen carrying it by the geek-chic--but dammit!  His previous novels were as good or better.  I bought my copy when it first came out, and read it straight through and told everyone I knew about it.  Now, I am embarrassed to talk about it.  It's like Ann Rice.  Her first book was enchanting--fresh and passionate and unpolished and pure.  I read it back in the early 80's before Rice was discovered.  Then suddenly everyone had read it.  Tom Cruise was in the movie.  It turned into a phenomena.  And ruined it all.  ....<br />I first encountered Gaiman years ago via his Sandman series of comic books.  Darn good stuff for the genre.  At the time it was new and interesting and creative as all get out.  I enjoyed the first few issues, then went off to Japan for a few years and forgot about Gaiman.  Ran into _Good Omens_ while living in Boston.  He collaborated with Terry Pratchett on that one, and it was not bad, but not very good either.  I dismissed Gaiman at that point as being another comic book author novelist wannabe.  Years later I was talking to some friends about Gaiman and _GO_ and the Sandman series and felt ashamed at my shallowness.  When his next book came out I bought it just to be open-minded.  Damn.  Gaiman's first novel was better than most authors' best novels.  _Neverwhere_ has some of the most disturbing evil-doers I have ever run into.  A few years later _Stardust_ came out and proved Gaiman was not a one-hit wonder.  Completely different style and feeling.  And now _AG_ is another completely different book.<br />Gaiman is the best original artist on the SF&F scene.  His creativity knows no artificial boundaries--he has plumbed the fairy tale psyches of multiple cultures: comic book sub-culture, Edwardian British Pavlovian Miltonian anti-culture in the sewers, and the 50's depressing noire crime novel of violence and manipulation/uplifting golden age of sci-fi fantasy novel of dragon slaying and heroism.<br />I wish I was Gaiman.vil-doers I have ever run into.

She let me listen to it, and I loved it. i went out and bought my own copy. Even though I have every CD he has made, thriller is my favorite. I know most people probobly think so too. Its honestly not that suprising to see why people like it, all you have to do is listen to it. My favorites are Billie Jean, PYT, Thriller, beat It, Wanna be startin something, and Baby Be Mine. Do your self a favor and buy it!
B00005NWZ2|5.0|Thirty years after I first bought this on vinyl after hearing &quot;Bang a Gong (Get It On)&quot; on the radio, this is still my favorite T. Rex album and arguably the best of Marc Bolan's career.  As previous reviewers have noted, this 30th anniversary edition is not perfect.  Here's my take on a classic album which Rolling Stone magazine named one of &quot;The 100 Best Albums of the Past Twenty Years&quot; back in 1987.<br />CHEERS:  Excellent remastering by original producer Tony Visconti.  New liner notes detailing the recording sessions are provided by Visconti as well. In addition, Visconti includes numerous photographs (of varying quality) from his personal collection.  The most significant addition to this latest reissue is the inclusion of thirty minutes of &quot;works in progress&quot; versions of eight of the album's eleven songs.  &quot;Mambo Sun&quot; is actually the master take minus the backing vocals and guitar solo.  &quot;Rip Off&quot; is an instrumental run-through.  Many of these songs include false starts, but at least one entire take is heard, often with Bolan giving musical directions before counting off the song.  Some of these takes must be very early versions in that on &quot;Get It On&quot; you hear Bolan telling the band what to do during the song.  The only bonus track that is not a complete take is &quot;Planet Queen&quot; which breaks down about thirty seconds into the song.  Like many of the tracks on the Beatles' Anthology series, this is a wonderful opportunity to listen in on the recording process as these songs take on their final form.<br />JEERS:  While the bonus tracks are a nice addition, it would have been nice to see A&amp;M follow the example set by Demon Records in their excellent reissue series beginning with T. Rex's post-Electric Warrior catalog by adding non-album singles and b-sides. [Demon added three tracks to 1972's The Slider and 7 tracks to 1973's Tanx.] Songs that should have been considered for bonus track status include &quot;Raw Ramp,&quot; the b-side of &quot;Get It On&quot;; and &quot;Hot Love,&quot; T. Rex's first UK No. 1. It topped the British charts for five weeks in March and April of 1971.  [I have a 1985 cassette of T. Rextasy on Warner Bros. which includes these two songs plus everything from 1969's &quot;Ride a White Swan&quot; through 1973's &quot;20th Century Boy,&quot; but sadly that release is currently out of print.]<br />While T. Rex never had the kind of stateside popularity that they enjoyed in England, Electric Warrior (along with The Slider and Tanx) are good examples of what the hysteria was all about.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|The &quot;extras&quot; on this DVD are enough to force the switch from VHS to DVD.  The &quot;green fairy&quot; / &quot;velvet curtain&quot; features where you can get little behind the scene mini-documentaries is fantastic.<br />This movie is a rich tapestry of brain candy.  The DVD reproduces it faithfully and provides so much extra info to help explain it and enjoy it further.  One of the best DVDs I have seen.
B00000JPH6|5.0|&quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; was a Jim Henson masterpiece, a skilful marriage of technology and art, a dark, unique creative vision that I believe is superior to &quot;Labyrinth.&quot; The characters are non-human puppets and animatronics, one reason why audiences found it hard to relate to the protagonists Jen and Kira. It has been called &quot;a flawed masterpiece,&quot; but in my eyes it is one of the best fantasy movies ever made. I tried to read all of the Tolkien novels, but this kept my attention far longer and shared some of the same elements (good versus evil, mythical beings, power struggles between ruling clans).<br />Still as fresh and unique as when it was released in 1982, this DVD edition features fantastic extras that enhance the viewing experience, such as a 50 minute documentary of the making of &quot;The Dark Crystal,&quot; an isolated soundtrack (Trevor Jones' score is gorgeous...this way you get a soundtrack and a DVD at the same time (the original soundtrack is now out-of-print). There are two deleted scenes and original language working prints of the Skeksis. This is the ultimate version of the ultimate fantasy tale. Ten stars.
0316776963|1.0|I ordered this book, as well as &quot;Naked&quot; because they were recommended for people who enjoyed David Egger's &quot;Heartbreaking work of Staggering Genius.&quot;  I am not sure who decides on those recommendations, but boy were they wrong.  I was unable to finish either Sedaris book, as they were boring, bland and just plain unfunny.  Egger's book was introspective, fresh, and drew the reader in and made you care about what happened next, not to mention hilariously funny at times.  Both of Sedaris' books do little to make you interested in the characters at all and the humor they try to employ wasn't funny when the same jokes were made ten times before Sedaris made them.  If you enjoy comedy like recent years of SNL, then maybe you'll like this book.  But if you find that kind of humor boring and redundant, then don't waste your money (like I did).
B00005LKIM|5.0|Hannibal is a good movie. it is one of 2001's best movies and it has great acting and music. Though it probably won't win any Oscars or Golden Globe Awards I highly reccommend this to anybody (as long as they don't mind the gore).
B00005QJDG|2.0|The first part of this triple live CD set, Scenes From A Memory, is great (except for the backing vocals of Mike Portannoying).  But after that the rest of the live performances are boring and terrible!<br />Jordan Rudess is an amazing talent.  However, he sounds awful performing songs from Awake, Images and Words AND Falling Into Infinity!  His solo spot is equally atrocious.<br />James Labrie is a studio singer.  He just can not pull his own live, unlike Geoff Tate or other more talented singers.<br />John Petrucci sounds tasteful and intune as usual.<br />Mike Portnoy overplays and should not be allowed to have a microphone.<br />Finally, the band's bass playing session puppet, John Myung, keeps on keeping on.<br />Save your money and buy the studio albums instead!
B00005LKIM|5.0|I can't beleive how this blockbuster horror movie got such a bad reputation. I also think that the script is good, not some (...) HANNIBAL is a chilling movie that actually gave me nightmares. I normally don't like horror movies but SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and HANNIBAL are both really good in my thoughts.
B00005QDW5|4.0|OK I admit when I got this CD I was not familiar with pre-&quot;Meddle&quot; Pink Floyd, so hearing syd Barrett you think of some the weird early Who on acid(but I still liked it). The one song from that period that featured Roger Waters is the space blues &quot;Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun&quot;. Then it jumps to &quot;Meddle&quot; to the long but no filler &quot;Echoes&quot; and the great semi-insturmental &quot;one Of These Days&quot;. After that the songs are predictable but the inclusion of the pertinent &quot;When The Tigers Broke Free&quot; is very welcome. Still one can make the case for all of &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;(the album) and &quot;Speak to Me/Breathe/On The Run&quot;,&quot;Brain damage/Eclipse&quot;,&quot;Run Like Hell&quot;, and &quot;On The Turning Away&quot;(the best song on &quot;Momentary Lapse&quot;)
B00005QDW1|1.0|POP Steady, I WAS a huge  No Doubt fan untill the release of there last album.  Remember way back to the golden year of 1996 when No Doubt was rocking everybodies world with Tragic Kingdom?  Well they rock no more, there are just like all the rest of the TRL/MTV Bubblegum pop and there is only one person to blame:  Gwen Stefani!!!  Maybe she should spend less time rapping with Eve and Moby and more time writing GREAT rock songs.  They forgot about all there real fans in order to gain the respect of the 13 yr. old Pop fans.

Me and My Mom visited her sister and when I used my Aunt's sink and I turned the faucet on the old plumming pipes made a loud clanking noise like in this movie and every time I used her sink the noise made me think of the Money Pit. I have this video and I hope they put the movie on DVD!
B00003CX6P|5.0|The TMR moview is a masterpiece of suspense and a commentary of the ex-pat Lost Generation. This generation is the American young and wealthy crowd that seeks excitement and fun in each European city during a period when a buck was a buck in the early 50s. It is the time when Daddy's trust account could hide and erase sins and when thrills did not yet discover nose poweder, but skiing on the slopes and boating. Still true today, more so back then when the Net, data bases, and TV did not exist and did not flesh out the truth as readily.<br />Rather than rehash the plot, which has already been done on this board, I would like to offer this film as another commentary on the &quot;money is bad&quot; image, found in works such as Great Gatsby. The characters who have money in this movie, all have  dubious qualities; getting girls pregnant, trying to marry right, trying to party right,etc. That is acceptable as a moneyed crowd that does good would be too boring for a book or movie. However, the story takes the cliche rules and creates a knife with which to stab each character in the heart and punish them for their aimless lifestyle.But what a knife and so well done. Naturally, the ultimate act is murder and some may say, even true love lost. Now the story gets real interesting.<br />Will Mat be found out? Did the rich brats really need to trade a boring Park Avenue for this? In the end, the movie says that the idle rich are doomed. Meanwhile, one enjoys the great costumes, including the small hats, the beautiful landscapes, BCBG lifestyles, and the feeling that perhaps we wish we could have had this lifestyle. But be careful, don't wish too strongly.

B00003CXUM|4.0|I saw this film at New York's FIlm Forum and thought it was fascinating, having only seen Chungking Express and Fallen Angels, I had a cursory pre-conceived notion of what this film might be about. My expectations were defied and I left the film feeling perplexed and unsure of how to feel about this film. Cinematically it's the most stunning work I've seen Wong Kar-wai create, the camera work, the color schemes, the acting and the haunting use of music certainly demonstrate that he's working at height of his powers.<br />It was only after listening to Wong's commentary on his entry in the BMWFilms short film showcase that I began to get a better understanding of what was being said in In The Move For Love, but at that point it was out of theatres and only available as French import (which is a great special edition set, perhaps surprassing this release in regards to extras). Now that Criterion is release this film, it can be viewed (repeatedly) and the affect of the film can truly be appreciated.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|It takes a genius to take an ancient story, combine it with modern music, and produce something new, fresh, and absolutely incredible like this.  Surrealistic scenery is melded with very real emotion very much like &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; is spiced with &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit.&quot;  It sounds strange to talk about it, but it works in wonderous ways.  Pay special attention to the &quot;Roxanne&quot; tango, too. . . it's mind-blowing.<br />I'm always reluctant to see anything that is heavily lauded to me because it never lives up to my expectations.  Moulin Rouge surpassed them.  Love it or hate it, you should see it if only to appreciate what Luhrman has done to the art of filmmaking.  Even if you don't appreciate his innovation, even if you don't like the incredible melding of McGregor and Kidman's voices, even if you don't like the blatently silly sense of humor that permeates even the darkest moments. . . you at least have to love the costumes.
B00003CWNR|5.0|Wonderful film with wonderful performances and a heartfelt screenplay by the author of the novel.  Thank goodness women have a choice in this country...now if only more would fully understand that they have it.  We might have less ignorance and less poverty in this country.  Keep abortion legal!!  Outlaw fundementalism!
B000002OZY|5.0|Tommy was the true watershed album for the Who (both artistically and financially.) Musically, the band was moving further away from the three-minute single format (although the album did produce 'Pinball Wizard') towards an album-oriented approach that emphasized song-sequence and atmosphere. Witness the recurrent musical and lyrical motifs that pop up in songs such as 'Underture', 'Sparks' and 'Go To The Mirror'. It's obvious that this album was meant to be taken as a whole piece, preferably in one sitting with the incense burning. Try playing it on random mode and you'll see what I mean. 'Do you Think It's Alright', for example, doesn't make any sense unless it's followed by 'Fiddle About.' Highlights abound on Tommy, the best songs being 'Overture', 'It's a Boy', 'The Acid Queen' and 'We're Not Gonna Take It.' <br />The album eventually became a bit of a self-imposed albatross for the band, especially Pete Townshend, who already was thinking of a more ambitious project (the never-realized Lifehouse.) However, taken on it's own merits, it's certainly rates as a classic and may well be the highlight of The Who's career.
0783239408|5.0|Think about the best movie you ever saw. What made it your favourite? Was it the acting, the plot, the direction?<br />The best movies I've seen had all of these, but they done something else, more importantly, they touched me.<BR>American Beauty is one of these greats. It has depth, it made me think, question, and maybe appreciate life a little more. <BR>It's not a movie that spoke to everyone though, and that's fair enough. But hopefully, like Lester, everything fell into place, and for just a few seconds you realised how amazing life, and this movie, really is.
B00005NB0H|5.0|About five years ago, The Who re-released the classic Live at Leeds. As well as vastly improved sound quality, the new Live at Leeds also boasted an additional eight songs. Yet there was still a maddening lack of material from Tommy. Let's face it, any live Who album from 1970 needs to include most, if not all of the rock opera. The music just came alive in concert. With the re-release only including 'Amazing Journey' and 'Sparks', one couldn't help feeling a bit short-changed. This was slightly alleviated by the Isle of Wight release. However, the sound quality and the playing on that album still left something to be desired. So finally the band and MCA have done the right thing and given us Tommy from that momentous night at Leeds University, a night where the band was hitting on all cylinders and had yet to grow bored of running through the rock opera. While several songs were omitted that night (Cousin Kevin, Underture, Welcome,) Pete Townshend and the rest fly through numbers such as 'Fiddle About', '1921' and 'I'm Free,' hitting all the right climactic notes along the way. Keith Moon was absolutely on fire that night (compared to the Isle of Wight, where he seemed a bit slow,) and neither Entwhistle nor Daltrey make a false step throughout the course of the concert. The only slip-up comes during 'Christmas' where Townshend misses his cue on the bridge. However, this is nit-picking compared to the sheer majesty of 'We're Not Gonna Take It' and 'It's a Boy.'<br />An added bonus to this deluxe edition is that the double CD format allows for lengthy between-song dialogue, some of which had to be trimmed from the single CD re-release. The introduction to 'A Quick One' shows the Townshend/Moon comedy routine in full flourish.<br />The Who have been criticized over the years for constantly repackaging their older material. In many cases this is justified, since there really are only so many greatest hits albums that need to be made. However, the deluxe edition Live at Leeds deserves no such criticism and is a must-have for all of us who've been dying to hear Tommy performed by the band at the peak of it's powers.
B00000JGHM|4.0|I loved the movie, finally got to see 2 of my favorite actors together in one movie, and the movie does not dissapoint. A 3 hour long movie but I didn't even feel it was that long because of how into it I was. However, might be just my dvd copy, but the sound is extremely low. I had to put the volume almost to the max to hear it well, and its not my set because every other dvd i have does not do this. I also would switch to regular tv once in a while just to test, and regular tv would blast at that level...while the movie would just sound ok.
B000002J2F|4.0|Genesis' 1978 release &quot;...And Then There Were Three&quot; was dull and dismal. Despite this, Genesis gained more popularity on the strength of the fluke single &quot;Follow You, Follow Me&quot; from that album. What's even more surprising is that the follow up to that album, 1980's &quot;Duke&quot;, was energetic, well produced, excellently played, and miles ahead of it's predecessor. <br />This is the 1st Genesis album in which Phil Collins' vocals truly shine, since following Peter Gabriel's departure in 1975, Collins' voice seemed only a less than perfect shadow of Gabriel's. To be fair, their voices did share some similarity, but on &quot;Duke&quot;, Collins seems more comfortable in the role of lead singer and stretches out enough to show a good dynamic range and a powerful voice on cuts such as the opening &quot;Behind The Lines&quot;, &quot;Turn It On Again&quot; and &quot;Cul De Sac&quot;. <br />Despite what most people say about Genesis becoming more mainstream immediately following Steve Hacket's departure in 1977, the band still maintained a progressive edge througout subsequent albums.  However, &quot;Duke&quot; was probably the band's last truly great rock album.  From the opening trio of songs which start the album and the Rutherford composition &quot;Man Of Our Times&quot;, to the instrumental &quot;Duke's Travels&quot; and &quot;Duke's End&quot; which close the album, what you get is Genesis at their best: the ever excellent song driving keyboards of Peter Banks; Collins' rythmic, propulsive drumming; and Rutherford's energetic bass. Hacket's prowess is missed on this album, but Rutherford's guitar playing is solid throughout. <br />Of course, this isn't a perfect album: the pop hit &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; which admittedly brought the band an even bigger following, and the sappy ballad &quot;Alone Tonight&quot; which would have been at home in a Collins solo album, are weak and seem out of place. &quot;Cul De Sac&quot; makes it all worth ithowever, as this is one of the band's most heartfelt and accomplished songs, and the album ends on a perfect note with the two aforementioned instrumental pieces, which seem a fitting end to the prog rock era of Genesis.
B00003CXTG|4.0|This was a wonderful DVD which I recieved for Christmas. The special effects were something spectacular and from a historical point I feel I learned some new things. However being the length it was I feel a whole hour could have been cut out so we wouldn't need all the love stuff. However, all the love stuff does build to a very sad ending. Besides that, WONDERFUL!
B00005JKES|1.0|First, let me say how excited I was to see this DVD available- I remember loving Twin Peaks but clearly could not remember the content of the series. I was excited to see \\"episode I\\" which I (wrongly) assumed would be the pilot and would refresh my memory. I thought my disc was defective when I kept seeing and hearing \\"previously on Twin Peaks....\\"<BR>How can a disc which is advertized as \\"the complete first season\\" not include the pilot? How ridiculous! I am...buying the pilot... but... 1 star for deceptive marketing and advertizing.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Almost Famous Untitled: The Bootleg Cut - Director's Edition.<br />I've decided to review the Bootleg Cut of &quot;Almost Famous&quot; as most of the other reviews are of the original theatrical release.<br />This is a wonderful two-disc ( actually 3, more on this later ) DVD collection.<br />First, the packaging. We are presented with a brown tri-fold package, much like the bootleg recordings of the seventies. Not a whole lot of artwork on the cover. Simply a small photo of Kate Hudson (Penny Lane).<br />The first tri-fold presents us with a wonderful addition to this DVD set. Included is a STILLWATER Music CD. This music CD is only available in this collection and features songs from the film as performed by Stillwater. Four of the tracks are co written by Nancy Wilson ( of Heart ) and Cameron Crowe ( the director ). This little bonus CD is great and very appropriate to the theme of the set.<br />I'll jump now to DISC 2 of this set which is the Original Theatrical Version of &quot;Almost Famous&quot;. This is the academy award winning version that was released and it's great. The story is well told and very engaging.<br />DISC 1 is &quot;Untitled: Almost Famous : The Bootleg Cut&quot; which is not rated.<br />This version is a gift.<br />Cameron Crowe has taken the time to ( lovingly ) recut his film and include an additional 36 minutes of film. The addition of these precious minutes change the film but do not deminish it's impact or watchability.<br />The additional 36 minutes add mostly to the character of Penny Lane ( Academy Award Nominee Kate Hudson ) and expand on her history.<br />Unlike many extended versions which add little to character development, this version of &quot;Almost Famous&quot; brings more insight and depth to nearly all characters.<br />The acting is outstanding, and it's clear that the scenes not in the original release were cut strictly due to time constraints as the acting is right on.<br />This is a great cast. Kate Hudson is a stand out, as is newcomer Patrick Fugit. Billy Crudup is wonderful as well, this is the movie which should have made him a movie star. Jason Lee ( of &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; and other Kevin Smith films ) is hysterical and just enough over the top to be believable. The movie, this version, rests soundly with Kate Hudson and Patrick Fugit.<br />I would think, had this Bootleg version been released theatrically, then perhaps Kate Hudson would have actually won the Academy Award rahter than just being nominated. She's done a wonderful job with this complex character.<br />The director's commentary is priceless, much like attending a film school seminar as conducted by Cameron Crowe.<br />This two disc set is a must have for any film fan. Even if you've got the original DVD release ( rather than this special edition set ), this is still more than worth the purchase price.<br />I would recommend this set. Strongly.<br />Best Regards,<br />turtlex<br />PS - if you've enjoyed this review, feel free to add me to your favorite people list as I try to write reviews frequently.<br />Thanks for reading.stand out, as is newcomer Patrick Fugit.

B00005R87Q|3.0|Don't get me wrong. I liked this movie. The races were fun to watch, and the storyline was interesting enough. However, I felt that it did not truly represent the true street racers or dragsters....that and it's more like a 2 hour NOS commercial.<br />Why the heck would you race an RX-7 with a system that must have weighed like a ton in the truck? Or race any car that carries a 200 pound wing on the back? Oh no...one of the guys had a Motech exhaust on order....hehehehe....<br />Bottom line, you will like it if you can overcome thinking how over the top this movie is.
B000002MG1|5.0|I think I've heard most of R.E.M's albums, and they were all quite good. The more I listened to them, though, the more they started melding into each other in my head. Give a title of a R.E.M song and I probably wouldn't be able to tell you from which album it is; it's very likely I wouldn't be able to make the connection between the title and the song itself, either. Look, I'm sorry, R.E.M are a great band but they really do tend to repeat themselves. There are only three R.E.M albums that took me completely by surprise, and those are the ones to which I can still listen again and again: one is 'Murmur', their first LP, a brilliant album without a trace of commercial appeal (which is good); 'Monster', a very underrated album which, while it's not one of R.E.M's best it sounds like nothing else they've ever done (which is also good); and finally, 'Automatic For The People', R.E.M's masterpiece and one of the finest rock albums of the past decade.<br />Yes, 'Out Of Time' was good; it was R.E.M's commercial breakthru, and spawned two of the band's biggest hits - 'Shining Happy People' and 'Losing My Religion'. But, frankly, these two songs have been monsterously overplayed ever since, and the whole album, though it had a few good songs, lacked in soul. It seemed at the time of 'Out Of Time' that R.E.M were going mainstream. That makes it all the more amazing how unconcerned with commercial success their next two albums seemed. 'Automatic For The People', though it certainly sold (though not as good as 'Out Of Time') and made three huge hits (Man On The Moon, Drive and Everybody Hurts), wasn't about selling. It took huge chances and experimented with styles and sounds R.E.M never tried before.<br />It's those songs, the fresh, original ones, that make 'Automatic' one of the best albums recorded in years, most notably the several tracks making use of string backing (orchestration courtesy of Mr. John Paul Jones, formerly of Led Zeppelin!) - Everybody Hurts, the fabulousDrive (one of my favorite R.E.M songs, unusually sophisticated for an R.E.M radio hit; an extremely effective song with beautiful, bone-chilling echoed vocals) and the absolutely brilliant Sweetness Follows (my favorite track on this album. The bass here is just fantastic.) Other standouts on the album are the strange, 70s-prog-rock sounding New Orleans Instrumental No. 1, the fast rocker Ignoreland, and two beautifuly minimalistic songs - Star(yeah, right) Me Kitten and the beautiful Nightswimming.<br />'Automatic For The People' stands out as one of the most emotionally effective albums I've heard, with sort of a haunting, bitter-sweet atmosphere which lingers throughout the entire listening (although the songs themselves are very diversified and varied). Always depressing and uplifting at once; always hinting that, as bad as things may be, Sweetness Follows. The powerful emotional weight of the album is delivered beautifuly by Michael Stipe's eccentric, distant sounding voice, and strenghtened by an above-average use of organ, never before heard with such power on an R.E.M album.<br />Like Murmur stands out in an era of hair rock and heavy metal, Automatic stands out in an era of thrash metal and grunge; as R.E.M proves for the second time that rock doesn't have to be loud in order to be powerful. 'Automatic For The People' is an effective album that draws you into it, rarely giving you a moment's peace. a piece of music history, that will go down in the books as a classic. An experience recommended for everyone.
B00005Q45W|5.0|I have &quot;Alexandra Leaving&quot; (track 7) on virtual repeat... can't stop going back to it over and over again.  This record is a chilling masterpiece.  Though I would like to hear a version with a full band behind it (as opposed to this demo-ish synth backing), the synths work well in their own idiosyncratic way, augmenting Mr. Cohen's unique vision.  Whatever.  This record is the sound of sublime, absolute heartbreak, and you wouldn't want it any other way.
B00000JG41|5.0|Like nothing else ever released.  Simply amazing.  I may seem annoying at first, but trust me, it will grow on you.  You will be sining &quot;Sweet Charity, da da dada...I'm Home Free!!!&quot;  in the most inappropriate places.
630588255X|5.0|It's been almost 30 yrs since I first saw this movie, and I still get goosebumps when I think of it.  I hear the sound-track in my head.  I haven't seen the VHS or DVD - have never seen it except in a theater, but I advise you to see it any way you can.  See it more than once, but not too often nor too soon after the last viewing - keep it special.
B00000JPHG|5.0|If you're looking for how this movie compares with the other three &quot;Child's Play&quot; movies, I haven't a clue, because other than this movie, I've only seen Child's Play 3.  I liked this film because it mixed horror and humor successfully.  There are so many take-offs on other movies.  For example, at the beginning, you see the Freddy Krueger mask from &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; and Jason's facepiece from &quot;Friday the 13th.&quot; There's a part in the movie where Chucky rigs up some nails and sends them flying toward this one guy, whose face is punctured with holes.  That sorry fellow looks like Pinhead from Hellraiser with all the bloody holes in his face!<br />If there was too much gore without much humor, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed the movie.  The music from Rob Zombie made the movie even better.  It would be interesting if they make a &quot;Son of Chucky&quot; after this movie.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Pure popycock and predictable. Has very little signifigance with history or events that had to do with December 7th, 1941, just a crude backdrop for a weak story.<BR>Ben Afflick plays the marginally retarded toothy flyboy and a Matt Damon clone plays his strident friend.<BR>Very little is based on fact but as O have earlier stated, the story is predicable and weak.<BR>Avoid this stinker!
B00000IMCV|4.0|Oh man I loved this movie, probly one of my fav. zombie movies i seen. The movie isnt realy scary but its action packed and is funny and exciting. The movie is a little boring in the begining and around the end but the rest is great, the F/X are pretty good for the year it was made in. The plot is ok. It takes off from night of the living dead and then after dawn of the dead is day of the dead, but there is one thing i dont get, on &quot;night&quot; it said the zombies came from a radiation and on &quot;dawn&quot; it says that hell was to full so the dead walk here. but it dosnt matter this is a great movie, BUY IT!
B00005RFAI|5.0|I can only say that I am glad I made this purchase...the album rocks and Pink rocks.<br />Lil.
B00005QEO2|5.0|Okay, I know if you are an Aerosmith fan you most likely have 99 percent of the material already.  However, there is that 1% of new stuff.  Also, I have to say this is one of the sexiest covers of all time.  I don't know what it is about this album but I love the cover!  I know, pathetic but I am being honest.  I love Aerosmith, but if it wasn't for the cover, I wouldn't have bought it!
0446677450|1.0|... rather, it should be thrown with great force.   (Dorothy Parker)<br />My mother bought this for me as a Christmas present, and I wish she hadn't, because the author doesn't deserve a nickel for this ... <br />This book contains very little in the way of useful advice or information. Basically, the author tells you to stay out of debt, and invest in things (ie real estate, stocks) that you find deeply fascinating (he doesn't actually give you any concrete information or advice on these things - he just assures us that he studies them because he loves them). <br />What's that? You don't really find real estate or stocks all that interesting? You'd rather just find a job you love, that allows you to contribute to society in some way and make the world a better place, make some sensible investments for your old age, and retire? <br />Well, this book isn't for you then... <br />...If I were the editor, I could have pared this book down to about 20 pages of information and ideas (most of which are useless to most people anyway), but of course, you couldn't turn it into a book and sell it then, could you?  <br />It bears repeating that this book is condescending, so much so that I almost threw up while reading it (or threw the book out the window).  If you enjoy being talked to like you are a 12-year old, then this book is for you. On the other hand, if you're an adult who actually wants to read something intelligent about money, buy something, anything, else. <br />When I first wrote this review, I said the book \\"turned me into a socialist\\" because I was so outraged at the things \\"the rich\\" can get away with and how they think.  The joke was on me though, because it turns out that virtually nothing Kiyosaki says about \\"getting rich\\" in this book is actually true.  <br />This conclusion is drawn by real estate investment professionals ... because most of the scanty advice that actually *is* offered here is either <BR>1. illegal<BR>2. foolish and of no real benefit (using corporations as tax shelters) <BR>3. impractical - would only work in a fantasy world (ie find insiders willing to sell you their shares just before they do an IPO - great idea, but who is going to build a company to IPO, then sell their holdings to you so that YOU can make the killing?)<br />Conclusion:  ...as another reviewer wrote, this book has as much to do with getting rich as a James Bond novel does with real espionage work.  ....  <br />I could go on and on about the shortcomings of the book, but you get this idea.  This is surely one of the worst books ever written.
B00005JKT8|4.0|I went to this movie, not entirely sure what to expect. Plot holes and the rather unbelievable issue of time travel aside, it was a good movie. Will it win any Academy Awards? No. Does it make you think? Not really. Is there an important moral in the story? If so, I missed it. Was it predictable? In a way, yes. It was following the standard time travel romance formula. But it was fun. It was cute. It was sweet. It was an enjoyable 2 hours of make believe. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to relax for an afternoon. <br />Just a hint - the key to really enjoying this movie is to not come into the theater with preconceived notions. If you think this will be the best movie of 2001 you will be disappointed. If you think this will be the most romantic film ever, you will be disappointed, UNLESS you happen to be huge fans of the leads :). But if you go into the theater wanting nothing more than to be entertained for a couple hours, you will be pleasantly surprised.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|followed me out of the theater after seeing Lord of the Rings. Both times. And after a while, I realized that I was humming &quot;Aniron (Theme For Aragorn And Arwen)&quot; from the yet to be purchased soundtrack, at the time, in my head. The scene between the two, that accompanies this track, moved me to tears in the theater and I rarely care for love scenes. The love and assurance of the scene, is well depicted in the lilting tones of Enya's voice on this track. The beautiful chorus (@ 05:20) on track 17, &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot; is among one of my favorites on this CD. The main theme throughout the tracks is subtle, without too much repetition. I found a dark uncertainty (that I liked), even in the most joyous tracks. All in all, it is a great companion for letting your mind revisit this wonderous place. Enjoy!
B00005J6UP|5.0|This has always been one of my very favorite movies. The DVD is one of the best with its cool 3D option screens. I loved seeing \\"The Goonies\\" pristine, in surround sound, and--best of all--in widescreen. The extras were fab; especially the hilarious feature-length commentary reuniting all the kids from the film. It was worth the price of the DVD alone. (Although I do wonder why the remarkable Sean Astin disappears halfway through.) It was also cool to see the Cyndi Lauper music video again after all these years.The only thing that really disappointed me was that the three deleted scenes were not added back into the film. You can only view them separately which, quite frankly, bites. What's so strange about \\"The Goonies\\" deleted scenes is that many years ago, Disney Channel aired the film with all the deletions reinstated! I actually have this version on a video tape and I was hoping the DVD would be the complete film.All in all, an excellent DVD.
B00005NW02|5.0|This cd just blew my mind.  i had never heard an album this good in awhile.  I must of heared it a hundred times.  This system album is terrific. this was really the first time i heard them.  i do not regret getting this cd.  it is different and original. sarj is a mezmerizing artist along with the other guys who hypnotize you with there very last song.  let it take you on a trip.  SYSTEM OF A DOWN ROCKS! ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS!!!!
0385506244|2.0|I agree with Susan from Florida.  This book is pretty lame.  I thoroughly enjoyed Grisham's legal thrillers, and have read all that he's written.  But the writing in this one is not up to par.
B00005QXXO|4.0|When all is said and done, Radiohead is still a rock band, as they proved with this release.  Many of the songs have been beefed up to actually sound like they're coming from a five-piece band.  Like Spinning Plates with its solo piano, Dollars and Cents in its frenzy and the title track sound far less spaced-out and much more listenable than they were on the studio releases.  Perhaps this is how they were &quot;intended&quot; to sound.<br />My major complaint with the CD is the same complaint I had with Amnesiac.  It sounds slapped together, without any cohesion.  the only songs that sound like they're in the right place order-wise are The National Anthem and True Love Waits.  Also, the live version of Everything in Its Right Place gets a little chaotic and runs a little long.<br />I said this in my Amnesiac review, and I will say it again.  Kid A, Amnesiac, and I Might Be Wrong were all recorded around the same time, so they should be regarded as one release, one recording.  Why they didn't just take one entire concert (like the mind-blowing Seattle concert) will always boggl my mind, but my little nitpiocks should not keep you from buying an amazing, albeit short, live CD.
B00005AWMF|5.0|Great CD. This CD is the type you can listen to over and over again. I find it very entertaining, exciting and relaxing all at once. Great music and a must have for any Sade fan.
B00005B4GU|4.0|People are going to hate me for this, but I really enjoyed this album.  Amnesiac is not B-sides from Kid A as most people seem to think, but rather Radiohead had two complete CD's ready at the same time.  As such, Kid A and Amnesiac, as well as &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; should all b regarded as one CD, one compilation.<br />That said, Amnesiac seems to serve as the missing link between OK Computer and Kid A.  While it is still sparse, spaced-out and epic all at the same time, it seems to be much more &quot;band-based&quot; than their 2000 release.  Many of the songs work incredibly well.  Pyramid Song could be the eeriest song in history.  I Might Be Wrong seems to be a more melodic version of The National Anthem.  The absolutely incredible Dollars and Cents and Life in a Glasshouse close the CD with style.<br />But many things didn't work.  Thom Yorke's vocals, while at their meloncholy best, don't sound as polished as they did on Radiohead's previous releases.  Songs like Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors are just too out-there to enjoy.  But perhaps the biggest disappointment is the arrangement of the CD.  While OK Computer and Kid A sounded like complete albums, Amnesiac seems like it was just slapped together.<br />I still strongly recommend you get this CD, as it provides insight into what is to come for Radiohead.  It is a wondrful CD.
B000051VWW|4.0|This is a nice smooth CD, definately easy listening. I enjoy listening to the CD when my fiancee plays it. It is not her best work, I much prefer her &quot;Best of Sade&quot; CD. There are a couple of great tracks, but I think she is sticking to what is comfortable rather than demonstraiting her range of talents.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The movie was much more enjoyable than I initially thought it would be.  It was also much more unconventional!  I really liked the unexpected twists, like music from Nirvana, that popped up throughout the film.  Yes, the &quot;Roxanne&quot; and &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; scenes were pretty awful but overall I really enjoyed the DVD version of Moulin Rouge.  Contrary to what others have stated, I came away quite impressed with the vocal talents of both McGregor and Kidman.  Will I buy CDs from them?  Probably not.  Do they have adequate voices for a flick?  Absolutely!
6305508550|5.0|\\"Office Space\\" does for the movies what \\"Dilbert\\" did for the comic pages.  By taking the insanity of office life to it's logical, but absurd, conclusion \\"Office Space\\" has created an instant classic for those of us subjected to the \\"attack of the MBA's\\" on a daily basis.  At its core the movie asks the question we have all asked, \\"how much attention is anyone really paying to me?\\"  As the hero repeatedly does and says what we would all like to, he comes to be perceived as a \\"straight shooter\\" with \\"management potential\\".  Likewise, his co-workers represent the gamut of corporate personalities: the inane VP who spews corporate jargon to hide his gross ignorance, the weird guy who seems to operate outside any corporate hierarchy, the useless consultants, the idiotic support staff, they're all there.<br />The plot of the movie revolves around an attempt exact revenge on this corporation by ripping it off.  But you can take it or leave it, I would have been content just to watch the actors bash corporate sacred cows for two hours.  It's actually almost uplifting because it reassures the viewer that they are not alone in confronting stupidity on the job.<br />In the end, this is a shallow movie, and the DVD has no interesting extra features.  That doesn't matter though, because it is also a hysterically funny, dead on satire of office life.  If you're just looking for an escape from the daily grind, this is the movie for you.
B00005OMTT|4.0|Their vast music style is food for the ears and soul.A must for your collection!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|So much has already been written about this movie (and the DVD) it's hard to come up with more superlatives for this review, but I enjoyed \\"Shrek\\" so much I have to take a stab at it.  To start, the story is excellent; it's cute without being juvenile, and moves with great pace.  The plot has been rehashed repeatedly here so suffice it to say that \\"Shrek\\" is a \\"fractured fairytale\\" in the tradition of the old cartoons by the same name.  Everything is completely familiar, and yet somehow completely out of whack.  The movie is also loaded with inside jokes, innuendo and oblique references that make it as much fun for adults as children.  It reminds me of Disney's \\"Aladdin\\" in its ability to contain a high level of sophistication while still being enjoyable as a \\"children's\\" movie.<br />The animation is also gorgeous; the elaborate and fantastic nature of the story set a high bar for the animators, and they cleared it easily.  Water, faces, fur, all are animated beautifully, but not in an overly precise fashion.  By that I mean that while this movie is undeniably a technological triumph, it doesn't where technology on its sleeve.  The difference between technology and art is heart, and the animators clearly recognized this fact.  The settings and characters all have a sense of whimsy and innocence absent from other CGI (Star Wars for example).<br />It is the voice talent that really makes the movie, however.  Mike Meyer's provides the voice for the gruff, but lovable Shrek, Cameron Diaz's spirit shines through as the princess, and Eddie Murphy is brilliant as the Donkey.  In fact, I would say that his performance, while overshadowed by Meyers' is the best in the movie.  The supporting cast is likewise outstanding, particularly John Lithgow as Lord Farquart.<br />As for the DVD, it is loaded with extras.  My personal favorites were the \\"actor\\" interviews, in which Shrek (for example), the CGI character not Mike Meyers, is interviewed about his role in the film, and theanimation bloopers reel which highlights some of the bizarre animations resulting from programming errors.  The DVD is also very kid friendly, featuring a variety of games and a sing-a-long.<br />In the end, \\"Shrek\\" is rightly being touted as one of the best movies of 2001.  It is sophisticated enough for an adult to enjoy, while at the same time a parent can let their kids watch it without worrying.  The voice talent and animation are both superb, and the story is entertaining and has great messages about inner beauty and the importance of friendship.<br />Enjoy!
B00005R87Q|1.0|Really Bad, After watching it at my local multiplex i had kids in 110hp hondas trying to shut down my 340 duster (12.340 @ 108.26 with a 1.710 60 ft time) leaving the parking, lot I mean I've seen hondas run in the twelves but with [an amount] of work ,Big Deal! I have less than 5 grand in my car. In one scene Paul Walker's car nitrous system overboosted? and blew the floorplan out of the car, what the...? Did I mention to get those cars to look like 11 second cars they had to CGI them and to top it off Vin Diesels Dads Charger doing a burn out and wheelie WHAT!!.And his dad died at the last turn of a drag race??<BR>It's bad when hollywood makes these pop culture movies without real research and in turn make 200 million.remember theres no replacement for displacement..
0525946284|5.0|Riveting, suspensful, can't put it down.   One of the best mysteries to come along in a long time.
0385505833|3.0|This book was an easy read (2 hours), but not worthy of John Grisham.  Don't buy the hardcover - wait for the paperback, or better still, borrow it from the library.  It's not one you will keep on your shelves and re-read.
B000002UAR|5.0|I picked this up on disc, after my turntable finally failed and I could no longer play my vinyl copy.<br />This is a great record and everyone should have a copy.  The Beatles had mastered their recording techniques, and could use the studio to achieve the sounds they wanted, and were still writing brilliant pop songs. Their ambitions had not yet outstripped their songwriting abilities, resulting in brilliant moments like &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; and &quot;Your Bird Can Sing&quot;.  The only drawbacks to this album are &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and the occasional use of the sitar, but those are minor.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Episode I The Phantom Menace, altough it has been severely criticized by purists, remains an excellent starting point for the saga.<BR>As for the DVD edition, the features are just superb: deleted scenes, a bunch of data that originally appeared in the website and full leghth commentaries. No Star Wars fan should pass on this one.
B00005NWRS|4.0|Ryan Adams is a great songwrtier, and if he could maintain focus over the course of an album, he would produce a classic, but he is so prolific that he puts out a lot of stuff that is not up to snuff.  As a result, his discs are all good, with flashes of brilliance, but they are never the knockout punch I think he has within him.
B00005JKMO|4.0|Will Smith is excellent.  Beyond excellent.  He was the champ.  A great story.  the guy that plays Malcolm X, though, is no Mr. Washington, and is rather unconvincing.  Which is the biggest flaw of the movie.  That role had to be convincing to elevate this movie to the top.  But this is without a doubt the best boxing movie ever, and the fact that the boxing was real is the difference between this ... and say, Raging Bull.  But all in all, Ali is still an engima, and that is both good and bad.  This movie tries to get beyond that, but it fails, ultimately, as no two hour movie could ever penetrate the myth.  And of course, this movie doesn't deal with his current illness and his immense courage at facing that.  All I can say is Ali was the greatest, and we all have something to learn from his story.  But the best movie ever made about him is and probably always will be &quot;When We Were Kings,&quot; the basis for the whole finale of this movie.  The loveable Foreman (creator of the Foreman grill) began as a cold-blooded killing machine, intent on killing Ali ... until The Rumble In the Jungle and the fabled &quot;rope-a-dope.&quot;  Ali was the greatest!
B00004Z459|5.0|Though Linkin Park is considered a dominating force in the alternative rock scene, their freshman album \\"Hybrid Theory\\" managed to embed hard rock, hip-hop, and electronic sound bites into a powerfully organic compilation of genres.  Beyond a combination of instruments and DJ-produced sounds, Linkin Park hit the nail on the head with the carefully placed dual vocals of fervent singer Chester Bennington and rapid-fire emcee and vocalist Mike Shinoda.  While Bennington reveals his tortured feelings in the song By Myself, Shinoda replies in a fierce yet somehow mild tone the reasons for Bennington's angst. Their music, though frighteningly original for a young, new band, draws influence from such greats as Deftones and Nine Inch Nails through their crunchy yet addictive sound and guitar riffs.  With those fantastically chosen bases for songs, Shinoda attempted and succeeded in digitally mixing the raw elements to create the twelve masterpieces that are \\"Hybrid Theory.\\"  In addition, DJ Joseph Hahn deserves a great deal of recognition for his intricately created beats and special effects, which help tie in the different ingredients Linkin Park chooses add into their mix.  Producer Don Gilmore, known for his work with Pearl Jam, can be accredited for some of the blending in musical styles, but also the unification in emotions vibrating from the overall sound.  Linkin Park used its hybrid qualities to create an optimistic and melodic album that surprisingly merged perfectly with its confrontational and frustrated side.  This original and fresh sound is more than likely one that shall be and already is being imitated without success by newer bands realizing the astounding flawlessness that is Linkin Park's \\"Hybrid Theory.\\"
0385505833|5.0|This book is an easy read that pokes fun of the absurdity of the materialism of Christmas.  It was absolutely hysterical and a different &quot;type&quot; of writing for John Grisham.  He can write more than lawyer books! A must read!
B00005QDW1|5.0|I don't see how all of these critics are giving this cd such bad reviews!  I LOVE it! No Doubt is by far the best band in the world!  In my opinion ND has not sold out, they do sound different but still have their wonderful fun sound.  This album is a lot happier than ROS (I absolutly loved ROS).  Rock Steady does have mechanical sounds but is not techno.  My favorite songs are &quot;platinum blonde life&quot; &quot;detective&quot; and &quot;Don't let me down&quot;  Those three songs are pretty much the &quot;old&quot; No Doubt that we all love.  But I do recomend this to anyone!!  It is not repetitive as some say (buy it don't just stream it to your computer! it's just looped that way and you don't hear the whole song) and I happen to like the intro!  It is a clip of &quot;Rock Steaddy&quot; and it lets you know what you're in for, great fun!!!
B00005JKQX|3.0|Film, particularly as practiced in Hollywood, is based on audience manipulation. So it's no surprise that lifelong Hollywood resident Ron Howard is a master manipulator. A life spent inside the machine has taught him exactly which buttons to push to get the desired reaction from his audience. He is so skilled at this that we in audience don't mind the manipulation while it's taking place. And &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; may be the most skillfully manipulative of Howard's films. The film hits all the proper emotional notes as it tells its story of love triumphing over adversity. Sadly, it's bunk. Even the most cursory look at the truth behind Nash's life reveals the screenplay adapted from a recent biography of Nash by Akiva Goldsman (who brought us the two most recent, atrocious &quot;Batman&quot; scripts) as sanitized for mass consumption. Gone is any mention of Nash's infidelity and bisexuality, and what are we to make of the &quot;love conquers all&quot; story when we learn that Alicia Nash in fact divorced her husband when his deteriorating mental state became too much to bear. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connolly give terrific performances, as does Ed Harris playing an invented character who is better developed than many &quot;real&quot; characters in other films. Howard's directorial skill and Crowe's screen charisma even make witnessing such moments as a paranoid Nash slowly sliding down a locked door sobbing in a heap on the floor seem to carry emotional weight (at least until we think about it for more than twenty seconds). This review began as a recommendation and while the film is more worthwhile than most Hollywood product you'll see this year, I'd say just don't expect to gain any insight into the nature of genius, madness, love or any other especially human qualities.
B000002HAJ|5.0|This is one of my favorite Cure albums. Just as I thought that The Cure had matured greatly with \\"Disintegration\\", I was hit with \\"Wish\\". I have always loved Robert Smith's slow, sad, dark, passionate songs and this album delivers my very favorites. \\"Apart\\" is song that if you have experienced a broken heart, you are guaranteed to cry. \\"Trust\\" is song that will make you thinking about THE ONE. It is a perfect wedding song. \\"To Wish Impossible Things\\" is a song that makes you think about the LOVE that we are looking for that may not exist. I have my moments with all three songs and they have always made me cry, especially at low times. Robert Smith sings out of passion and with every song, it seems that he is truly feeling what he is singing about. There are not many groups with such passion. \\"Open\\", \\"From The Edge Of the Deep Green Sea\\", \\"Cut\\", and \\"End\\" are both very dark and powerful. \\"High\\" and \\"Friday I am In Love\\" need no introduction since they are singles of the album. \\"Wendy Time\\", \\"A letter to Elise\\" and \\"Doing The Unstuck\\" are fantastic to relax and listen to. THis is a must have for all and not just the die hard fans like my self.

B00005JKMO|4.0|He defeated Sonny Liston in 1964 for the heavyweight title, and shortly thereafter converted to Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Ali; was stripped of the title a few years later; reclaimed the heavyweight title by defeating George Foreman in 1974.  He was Cassius Marcellus Clay.  He is \\"The Greatest\\".<br />But is \\"Ali\\" the greatest?<br />To begin, \\"Ali\\" shows that there is more to Ali's life than boxing, that the fiery charisma he radiates extends beyond the ring.  His conversion to Islam and his proud defiance in refusing to be inducted into the U.S. army are as dynamic as his in-ring demeanors.  In addition, he is also surrounded by some interesting personalities:<br />Angelo Dundee (Ron Silver) - Ali's faithful trainer<br />Howard Cosell (Jon Voight) - sportscaster whose on-camera tussles with Ali, in which Cosell takes all the comedic beatings, masks a deep friendship between the two<br />'Bundini' Brown (Jamie Foxx) - Ali's moral supporter who has disappointed him in more ways than one<br />Malcolm X (Mario van Peebles) - influential speaker for the nation of Islam, the catalyst of Ali's Islam conversion, and with whom Ali forged a mutual respect and social beliefs<br />Cassius Sr.(Giancarlo Esposito) - an artist, and Ali's father though not a very good one in his opinion<br />Elijah Muhammad (Albert Hall) - the conservative head of the Nation of Islam, and the one responsible for giving Ali his current name<br />Herbert Muhammad (Barry Shabaka Henley) - son of Elijah, and Ali's not-so-dependable manager<br />Don King  (Mykelti Williamson) - boxing promoter whose flamboyance is rivaled only by his love of making money<br />Howard Bingham (Jeffrey Wright) - Ali's no-nonsense agent and best friend<br />Chauncey Eskridge (Joe Morton) - Ali's reliable attorney<br />And he is also a ladies' man.  Who can forget his bevy of wives which he has captured in suave but poetic fashion - the first Sonji Roi (Jada Pinkett Smith), the second Belinda Boyd (Nona M. Gaye), and the third Veronica Porsche (Michael Michele) whom he met in Zaire prior to the Ali-Foreman bout but did not marry onscreen.  Plus, the closing lines stated that he took one more wife.  Let's not forget his longsuffering mother Odessa (Candy Ann Brown).<br />The screenplay covering Ali's prominent moments of his professional career does not deviate from historical facts.  They are presented in three parts: the beginning part details his entry into fame with the Ali-Liston fight, his conversion and name change, and his associations with Macolm X; the middle part focuses on his trials, vindication and the Ali-Frazier fight; the final part culminates on the Ali-Foreman fights.  Director Michael Mann does a terrific job in keeping these three parts distinct.  However, he spotlights almost exclusively on Ali's public life in the final part.  He also included some scenes that are better left out, as they are more unimportant than informative.  Chief among them being cameos by LeVar Burton as Martin Luther King in only one scene - the assassination scene - and Malick Bowens as despotic Zairian president Mobutu dining in his palace.  So we know these two political figures exist, but what purpose do their scenes serve?  Another distraction is the excessive coverage of Malcolm X, which includes his assassination shown in gratuitous gore.  Even with the coverage minimized, his liasons with Ali would still be effectively presented, instead of taking up nearly the entire beginning part.<br />As the Champ, Will Smith is The Greatest.  He captures the iconic personality perfectly, which Mann successfully translates to film with adept close-up shots while zooming out appropriately to capture Ali's flamboyant speeches.  His boxing sequences are riveting, thanks largely to Michael Bentt, James Toney and Charles Shufford, who play Sonny Liston, Joe Frazier and George Foreman respectively.  They are interspersed with slow motion sequences to heighten the hair-raising tension of getting clobbered by a devastating uppercut.  Although the actual fights themselves are far less dramatic than Mann's version.  Foxx is surprisingly impressive in a non-comedy role, even adding some comedy routines of his own without disrupting the drama.  Another great performance of mention is Voight being almost unrecognizable as Cosell with his conspicuous toupee and his stiff but somewhat goofy portrayal.  Now we know he can do comedy.<br />\\"Ali\\" concludes immediately after Ali's victory over Foreman, which seems abrupt.  The tensions between the Champ and Belinda was neither fully played out nor resolved.  I was half-expecting it to continue with Ali divorcing her and moving on to marry his third.  Indeed, \\"Ali\\" certainly floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee, but is overshadowed by Will Smith and the larger-than-life icon that he portrays.  Don't be disappointed if Muhammad Ali himself does not appear at all.clobbered by a devastating uppercut.  Although the actual fights themselves are far less dramatic than Mann's version.

0385505833|5.0|I have to say that when I procured this book I had to look at the cover twice to reassure myself that John Grisham had written it.  Why?  Two reasons, quite simply: (1) its brevity, (2) the blatantly interwoven satire and humor.  Regardless of the number of differences from the &quot;normal/average&quot; Grisham novel, the book was an easy read (a couple of hours at the most) and an enjoyable one.<br />The book takes an honest look at all of the nonsense we engage in at Christmastime.  Unlike some reviewers who have dubbed this a &quot;Bah, Humbug!&quot; book, I received it quite oppositely.
B00004Z459|5.0|Well, what do I say? I bought this CD about a year ago, and it hasn't been outta my CD player since! Totally addictive. A hybrid *hence the name hybrid theory* of rap, hip-hop, rock, electronica and just about everything else imaginable. 12 top tracks. it's got everything, ear splitting guitars, high pitched record scrathing screaming lyrics, drum beats and some wicked emceeing. some hard rock tunes and some more gentle songs. just buy it. trust me on it, you won't regret it.
0792844890|4.0|...<br />Against this backdrop comes \\"Spaceballs\\", a sendup of not only the \\"Star Wars\\" saga, but also throws in references to a few other sci-fi movies as well.  It isn't the comedic masterpiece that \\"Blazing Saddles\\" is, but it is definately his best work since the mid 70s.  The film is aided by the fact that it is only trying to be a spoof, rather than trying to make a point, like some of Brooks' less successful efforts have tried to do.<br />The biggest suprise in \\"Spaceballs\\" is Rick Moranis.  I never thought that he was a particularly strong actor until this film.  He does a terrific job as the evil Dark Helmet and has the right mix of appearing to be serious and coming off goofy.  John Candy (Barf the mog), and Daphne Zuniga (Princess Vespa) also put in great performances.  The rest of the cast, including Brooks' pair of characters (the President and Yogurt) provide a decent, if unremarkable supporting cast.  Lorene Yarnell of Shields & Yarnell is even in here, and you can guess whose part she played.<br />The script is fairly well written, although more crass than previous Brooks' efforts, and serves as a decent vehicle for all the jokes and gags.  Some of them will make you groan, but most will make you laugh.  There are enough clever gags here to entertain for the entire length of the film.<br />\\"Spaceballs\\" is proof that Mel Brooks can still make a very funny movie.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This is SUCH a funny movie.  I love Shrek!  I also love Donkey and Princess Fiona.  There are so many twists and turns throughout the movie and they all meld so beautifully.  I love the juxtaposition of modernity in a medieval world.  I also like some of the swipes at Disney that come throughout the movie (Thank you Mr. Katzenberg!) It is a beautiful love story, a great adventure and a thriller all rolled into one.  I have seen it three times and could see it three hundred more and find something new each time I watch.  Simply the most wonderful movie, animated or not, I have ever seen.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I drove to West Hollywood in the summer of 2001 to see 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' on the big screen. I was discovering indie films for the first time and upon reading a review of 'Hedwig', I knew I had to see it. The film was good, no question, but in no way did it have any deep impact on me. I liked it enough to buy the soundtrack and listened to it quite often. Soon, I knew all the words to the brilliant songs by Stephen Trask, and with a second viewing of 'Hedwig' on DVD, it became my favorite film...the songs are absolutely phenomenal, Trask is one of the most talented songwriters I have ever had the pleasure of hearing...John Cameron Mitchell is exceptional in his role of Hedwig, and does an awesome job directing...the story of 'Hedwig' touched me like no other, and I still shed a tear upon each viewing...&quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; is an amazing film, and my day is not complete without a viewing...in my opinion, this is THE best film ever made...a heartwarming, feel great film worth seeing over and over...I finally showed it to my 13-year old sister and she loved it...Trask and Mitchell are amazing...Hedwig Rocks!!!
0783222955|4.0|Excellent movie.  I got the movie because my son had to watch it for his English class.  He said the movie was just like the book, and he could follow it quite well.  The characters were well drawn out.  The courtroom scene was wonderful and showed the great skill of Gregory Peck as an actor.  It also showed how the South used to be (and can still sometimes be.)  I thought Scout was a wonderful character and how much she loved her father and her brother, Jem.  She knew the difference between right and wrong but didn't understand the &quot;class&quot; that separated her family from the other families in town. Even though a wrong was done, eventually it was righted in the most extraordinary way.
0792844890|5.0|Spaceballs is one of the funniest movies I own and is currently eclipsed in my collection only by Blazing Saddles and Its a mad mad mad world.  It the greatest scifi comedy poking fun at many many scifi moives first and formost star wars but there are plenty of trek jokes as well as few poking at Alien and Planet of the Apes amoung others.  If you do not own this and you have a dvd player go out and get it asap, you will not regret it.
B00005LOUS|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but I was a bit unhappy with some of it.  At least I found out why the Grinch is/was the way he is/was.<br />I thought that was a nice touch to the movie.  Gave the Grinch more of a past so we could &quot;understand&quot; him.  The Who's were nice, but I loved Cindy Lou Who's mom and the Whovier lady who competed at Christmas.  Those lights!  I guess I had hoped the Grinch, as played by Jim Carrey, would be a bit more Grinchy, but he wasn't.  That disappointed me.  Perhaps I need to watch it again to see what I missed the first time around.  Do watch it.  It is very pretty and the Whos are such a nice bunch.

B000002U9P|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite Tina Turner &quot;resurgence&quot; albums. While the critics never praised it at the time of it's release, it most definitely is one of Tina's best to stand the test of time. It sounds as fresh today as it did in 1986!  Her vocals have never been stronger from her renaissance period (with the possible exception of the &quot;Private Dancer&quot; album.) <BR>I tend to disagree with the reviewer who states that &quot;Girls&quot; doesn't work. I personally think it's one of the highlights of the album! Tina has such angst in her voice on this track - one can't help but feel her pain. <BR>My personal favorites on this album are the &quot;perfect&quot; title track, the torchy &quot;Paradise is Here&quot; (which by the way I have Cher's version also of which Cher can't hold a candle to Tina's), the ultra-emotional &quot;I'll Be Thunder&quot; and the snazzy top 2 hit &quot;Typical Male.&quot; <BR>All in all, a most worthy follow-up to &quot;Private Dancer.&quot;
0783225849|5.0|Hitchcock's Psycho shocked filmgoers in many ways -- he had the sympathetic lead killed early in the movie, a gruesome (though nearly bloodless) murder scene, strong symbolism (look at all the 'bird' images in the film), a return to stark black & white filming accompanied by Bernard Herrmann's strings-only soundtrack, and sophisticated marketing. Hitchcock was always a bit ahead of his time, and this is one of his pictures that really makes that point.<br /><br />This DVD edition looks and sounds great, and has many bonus features: the excellent one-and-a-half hour documentary, 'The Making of Psycho', which includes interviews with Hitchcock's daughter and leading lady Janet Leigh; a small but interesting set of production notes; information about the cast and filmmakers; theatrical and re-release trailers and newsreel footage of the film's release; the shower scene with and without music -- this was very interesting. There were also some bonus features that I couldn't get to run on my G4 Macintosh: production and behind-the-scenes photos; shower scene storyboards; lobby cards; posters and ads. The film can be heard in English or French, and subtitles are in English or Spanish.<br /><br />This is a landmark film. It looks and sounds good. The bonus features are very good. Highly recommended.

B00001QEE5|4.0|The Disney people were awfully talented, but they sure weren't leading the political correctness parade! There are definitely some egregious sexist plot devices and racially insulting utterings here that make this film seem dated, but it is difficult not to enjoy the great plot, wonderful songs and excellent direction. Captain Hook is a colorful villain, Tinkerbell rocks, and some of the scenes just take your breath away -- flying over London on the way to Neverland and our first sight of the island, for example.<br />The dvd edition is disappointing. You can listen to the film in English or French, and that is about it -- no subtitles, no storyboards, no voiceover, no extras at all. For the price, you might want to buy the VHS edition instead.  I believe there is a new dvd edition with extras and that may be more worthwhile.  This would be a less expensive alternative if you just want a copy for kids' viewing, perhaps.  If watching with children, you should also be prepared to discuss why we don't use the terms 'redskins' and 'injuns' anymore.<br />Recommended with reservations.
0446608955|5.0|This was a truly beautiful book.  I sat down and read the entire book in one evening, it is an easy read but is not just for young people.  I could not stop crying after I read the last page or so of the book, I had to read it several times.  Unlike another reviwer said, it does not say that Jamie dies, sorry if you have not read the book, but someone who obviously did not read the final pages reviewed the book and mistakenly said that she died, I do not believe, however, that she did and it does not say that she did.  So go back and read the last few pages, please, so you don't miss the true meaning of the book.  It is absolutely wonderful and I was immensly touched by it, I only hope that the movie version will be as good, and I can't wait to see it.
B000000WA4|5.0|This album is probably one of the best Smashing Pumpkins recordings ever made.  It does not display merely one sort of musical style; no, it goes from the intense, metal driven &quot;tales of a scorched earth&quot; to the instrumental title song &quot;mellon collie and the infinite sadness.&quot;  The singles that came out for this album are very good, and they deserve the attention they got. But after getting this album, you will see that the other songs are joys just waiting to be discovered.  &quot;thru the eyes of ruby&quot; is a masterpiece, and though it is not a single, it should be the first song you listen to.  &quot;porcelina of the vast oceans&quot;, &quot;to forgive&quot;, so many others are also worthy. Buy this album if you like the Pumpkins, maybe even if you don't. You won't be disappointed.
0790729644|5.0|Clint Eastwood's &quot;Unforgiven&quot; is one of the darkest Westerns ever made.  It is a rebuke to the old cinematic depictions of the West (including Eastwoods's early acting jobs) and  a powerful examination of the effects of killing.<BR>     Eastwood plays William Munny, a hog farmer who used to be a cold, heartess murderer with &quot;intemperate disposition&quot;.  &quot;I've probably killed just about every living thing that walked on this Earth,&quot; he says, and he's not proud of it.  Throughout the whole film he insists that he isn't like that anymore.  His late wife, a victim of smallpox, reformed him, and he now lives poorly with his two young children.  Times aren't good for them, and when a young hotshot who calls himself the &quot;Scofield Kid&quot; rides up with news of a bounty, he sees it as a way out.  <BR>     He recruits his old partner, played by Morgan Freeman, and the three go off to find and kill two cowboys who have cut up the face of a prostitute in a small town of Big Whiskey.  The brutal sheriff of the town is played by Gene Hackman, who won an Oscar for this.<BR>     Munny and the Scofield Kid are complete contrasts--one a self-mythologizing young man, the other a worn down old man who lives with the burden of his violent past.  By the end, they are still completely different from one another, but have practically switched places. <BR>     With &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; Eastwood comments on many things, including glamorization of violence (as represented by a naive young biographer) and how the want for revenge surfaces when those you know are murdered.  The  blood-soaked ending of the film is an appropriate finish, as Munny's old ways resurface in shocking fashion.  Those who regard this scene as a typical Eastwood &quot;shoot-out&quot; are missing the point--he is saying how hypocritical that childish term really is.<BR>     &quot;Unforgiven&quot; opens and closes with short statements that scroll across the screen, written in the fashion of an old Western novel.  By the end, we realize how those novels mask the true, terrifying, brutal, and sad nature of that place in that time, and how that life really isn't like a novel--or, perhaps, a Western movie.
0812975219|5.0|If you are a dyed-in-the-wool fundamental analyst, a puffed up CEO, a financial journalist, or a swaggering institutional trader, then odds are fair that you will hate this book with a passion, and feel equal parts loathing and resentment for its author. I am surprised that there are not more condescending or vicious one star reviews than the few I saw, seeing as this book is bound to offend just about every traditional Wall Street type there is (and they are not the most forgiving type).<br /><br />Being thousands of miles away from Wall Street in both mentality and location, I found this book to be effortlessly brilliant... one of the most insightful I have read in years. It comes across in the style of a casual coffee shop chat with an intelligent friend. Taleb does not assault your brain with new math or doctorate level concepts; rather, he points things out with such casual ease, you wind up wondering how you could have missed the clarity before. It is a case of adding valuable depth, rather than breadth, to knowledge of probability.<br /><br />I bought the book assuming Taleb would spend a lot of time arguing for the random walk theory of markets, when in fact the practical result appears to be the opposite. His thesis, as I see it, is that trading opportunities exist largely because man is genetically and societally programmed to be fooled by randomness, yet remains willfully oblivious to this fact... and thus the crowd creates exploitable market distortions through an ongoing series of irrational acts.<br /><br />The elements of humor and insight in this book are numerous, and I can't resist highlighting a few favorites. Taleb's observation of the \\"lucky fool\\" made me chuckle because I have come across, or heard of, so many lucky fools already over the course of my young career (like the friend of a client who turned 400K into 12 million pyramiding gains on a single tech stock in 1999, but then went bust on the ride back down because he was too naive to distinguish between skill and luck).<br /><br />Taleb's use of the \\"dentist's certainty\\" as a statistical average in comparing potential outcomes over numerous sample paths was very instructive, as were the final outcome examples of myopically aggressive traders John and Carlos in comparison to the cautious Nero Tulip. The powerful point is that it is easier not to be jealous of a mega-successful peer when it is known that the bulk of that peer's accomplishment was to be in the right place at the right time, suggesting the nature of their success--fortuitous gain from a random cycle or event--is of such ephemeral nature that it can disappear at any point (insert flashback to Nasdaq bubble here).<br /><br />Taleb's observation on the correlation between market observation and emotion was also excellent and original (to me at least). The lesson that even a high probability strategy will likely have negative emotional expectation over the short run, due to the exaggerated impact of negative emotions over positive ones, has many implications for those obsessed with watching every tick of their portfolios.<br /><br />In his thorough and methodical destruction of probability blind journalists, flavor of the month gurus and retrofitted market theorists, Taleb also highlights how the explosion of commentary and data in the information age arguably makes for worse trading decisions overall--and confers an advantage to the trader who can restrain himself from drowning in data. The way he watches CNBC also made me laugh out loud (read the book to find out why).<br /><br />He does not spare fund managers either, popping their balloonlike egos with a sharp argument based on the talented coin syndrome. Morningstar will not like his undeniable point that the majority of good track records taken from a large sample pool are based more on luck than skill... and that sudden and heavy advertising of such a track record only increases the likelihood that it is a statistical variance.<br /><br />Finally, I appreciated the way Taleb stresses firmly and repeatedly that one of his greatest strengths is knowing that he is weak. Humility is a sign of wisdom, and the proud generally have a shorter life expectancy, especially in markets. That, too, could be considered a central theme of this book.epeatedly that one of his greatest strengths is knowing that he is weak. Humility is a sign of wisdom, and the proud generally have a shorter life expectancy, especially in markets. That, too, could be considered a central theme of this book.
B00000K3UR|5.0|This is my favourite of all-time. No joke. I love Adam Sandler movies, and this one is the best. It was so funny, and it had a really good storyline. Adam Sandler didn't have a stupid character in this movie like in some of his other ones (Waterboy, Billy Madison, LITTLE NICKY). The other cast members were funny too, especially Rob Schneider. Everything about this movie was good, and if you liked other Sandler movies your most likely to like this one. Also check out &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot;, and &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot;.
0446608955|4.0|I am currently lying in wait for the movie to come out. I can only hope that it will be true to the book but I hope in vain that it will not be as tragic :-( The love you never thought would happen. Landen Carter and Jamie Sullivan the popular student body president known for his midnight galavantings in the graveyard and the conservative preacher's daughter who works the phrase &quot;the Lord's will&quot; into every sentence. She is actually a stereotype that I can relate to because I am a preacher's daughter. Anyway it seems like Landen is doomed to boredom around this girl but slowly she seems to grow on him and on the reader. You feel the emotion in the book. I bought this book and ate supper and sat in a cozy chair with it in my hand and had finished it within a few hours I could not bring myself to put it down. I will not go into detail but to say that the ending of this book had you in tears and you felt as if you too had lost something. This book is fitting for teenage girls with a high vocab or understanding  (like me)all the way  to grown up ladies. The sensitive guys might like it too but it's definitly not a macho book. I hope you enjoy the book! Maybe I'll see you at the movie Take care bye!
B000002BVN|4.0|The whole point of this CD was some that all of the remix fans, will have something to enjoy from MJ. I like the album. The reason why I gave it four stars, is because the remixes get kinda boring. If I took  break from them, and then go back to them, I'm sure they will be fresh again. The 5 new songs are amazing. I never thought they would be this good. &quot;Blood on the Dacfloor&quot; sounds like &quot;Remember the Time&quot;, and it is pretty good. &quot;Morphine&quot; is kinda eerie, but it is cool, too. &quot;Superfly sister&quot; is a great pop song, with a good beat. &quot;Ghosts&quot; is the best song on the album, with awesome beat &amp; lyrics!!! I LOVE IT!! &quot;Is it scary&quot; is kinda like &quot;Ghosts: Part II&quot; I love that song too. The emixes that I DO like as much as the regular songs, are &quot;Scream Louder (Flyte Time Remix)&quot;, &quot;2 Bad (Refugee Camp Remix)&quot;, and &quot;You are Not Alone (Classic Club Remix)&quot;<br />Overall I really do like this album. and I reccomend this to all of the remix fans, but for the MJ pop fans out there, you will not be disappointed with the new stuff.
B00003CXTG|5.0|For a film these days to be sucessfull  it needs Action, Special Effects and A Love scene, Peral Harbor contains all of these and more.  A fair few people have slated this movie but i love it.  The best part of the film is the attack on the harbor but the whole set up of the love story is interestung too.  Ben, Josh and Kate light up teh screen in some pretty good performances, which has helped the film alot.  This is a must see film and definetly one to own
B00003CXXJ|4.0|I just got this movie for X-mas, and I finally watched it today, and I thought it was awesome! The voices are so funny, and I really liked the story. The appearance of other fairytale characters was very interesting. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the bonus features are not as good as they seem. THe only good features are the Kareoke and music videos, besides that there is nothing else that is worth watching twice. I have the 2-disc Special Edition, and it is weird because the movie is on both discs?? Anyways, I do reccomend this DVD, but do not buy this for the bonus features, just buy it for the movie.
B00003CXBK|1.0|When I watched this for the first time on STARS(Ok,ok. So I didn't buy the DVD.Big deal) I was VERY disapointed. When  I heard about it and people were like, &quot;Watch the most popular Japanimation(Uggh!I HATE that word!)movie in America! It is just so perfect, I thought,cool! I'll have to watch it then!<BR>   So I waited...and waited...and waited for weeks to watch Princess Mononoke and when I FINALLY got to see it,I relized that,to me, it was of the most boring movies I have ever watched! I didn't even watch the whole thing!<BR>      So please people, don't get this movie! Rent this first if you must see it!

B000009ROK|5.0|There is no one that even comes close to this man and his music and most certainly his beautiful voice! He sings these songs as if he were pouring his heart out to YOU trying to win your love back  the way he carries himself when he sings is awsome LM is the BEST! I have every Cd he has ever made. there are no other words other than excellence!
B00005OM4N|5.0|In order to appreciate any CD produced for this performer, you must be in the mood for a tinkling dance beat overshadowing computer enhanced vocals (any audio track associated with Ms. Spears conjures images of Rocky the Flying Squirrel singing through spinning fan blades into a big coffee can).  Five stars only during the mood.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The movie: <br /> Amazing pace, mixing our emotions faster than you can handle it, with a beautiful photography, very good acting, positive direction and excellent use of music. <br /> It's a fin-de-siècle love story pushed forward 100 years on the atmosphere, not the scenery. It reminded me my youth at Rio and Buzios, when I went out to night clubs with my &quot;bohemian&quot; friends to experience new emotions, conquers and many of the good things life and love have to teach us. <br /> The DVD: <br /> THX video, DTS sound. Nothing else to say about the transfer. The extras are very interesting. I only missed the Toulouse interviews available on the site. BUT they put the nice &quot;Come What May&quot; dance version there. Many interviews, a making-of, dance specials, full featured extras for those who enjoyed the movie. <br /> If you used to go to night clubs when young, enjoyed life, has fallen in love many times, like to dance, well, why haven't you bought this DVD made some space on your living room and taken your partner for a dance? Enjoy. Have fun. Love.
078062999X|5.0|Someone wrote... &quot;You can't employ the likes of Jack Lemmon (Marcellus) and expect to have a great Shakespearean performance. I would much rather have seen unknowns who could pronounce their lines and understand the subtext....&quot;<BR>Come on, these people were coached by professional Shakespearean scholars. Does the writer really believe Lemmon, or any of the other actors played their part cold? They knew the meaning of the text and subtext they were speaking. It is nothing but pure snobbery to assert otherwise. This is the only full text film version of the play; that in it self is interesting. But it is also a fine production, visually exciting, and well acted. It is a very good production that stands well among others. Well worth seeing and owning.
0399143904|5.0|I've read many Clancy novels over the years, and there have been some that had been very difficult to get through but not this one.  I bought this book after the 9/11 incident, so I felt a little strange reading it (deja vu?), especially since the first scene starts out aboard an airliner which, unfortunately for the bad guys, John Clark was on board.<br />In this book, John Clark's wife and daughter are involved in the story and their characters are somewhat developed - calm, successful career women who also took care of the family.  Being a female reader (I don't know how many of his readers are, but none of my female friends read his books), that's a plus, just keep it a little more interesting.  John's character is very likeable and endearing, especially right now in our (at least my) need for strong heros.  I also celebrated because they were, in general, successful with their fight against the terrorists - a good overcoming evil incident every couple of hundred pages - which kept me going.<br />I was anticipating something bigger to happen when the bad guy was going to use the chemical agent in the fogging system, but I remember thinking, &quot;That was it?  It was too easy!&quot;  Also, the ending was sort of abrupt.  I wasn't sure EXACTLY what happened to the bad guys in the end, so I feel like I'm left in suspense.
B00004WGAI|4.0|A production that runs for 4 hours long, capturing nearly every scene and almost word-for-word dialogue from the novel, and featuring a hero that's so good looking, passionate and likeable (Timothy Dalton's &quot;Mr Rochester&quot;), this is easily the best and thus far, unsurpassed adaption of Charlotte Bronte's famous novel.<br />I agree with the other reviewers that Dalton is too handsome to play Mr Rochester (not that one's complaining). I just have some minor problems concerning Zelah Clarke's portrayal of Jane. I know that Jane Eyre is supposed to be plain-looking in the novel, but I'm surprised that some reviewers even wrote that Zelah Clarke &quot;isn't plain-looking enough&quot;. Goodness me! I think Zelah is too &quot;unpretty&quot; next to Dalton's good looks! For a start, Zelah is too old to play 19-year old Jane (she looks 30). Secondly, her features are quite mousy at times and her face is (I'm sorry to say) almost flat as a pancake! She's also too soft-voiced and quiet. We want to see a more interesting Jane Eyre -one who has more &quot;fire&quot; in her! Fourthly, she's too small-sized and short - her height does not even reach Mr Rochester's shoulders! This makes the hugging and kissing scenes appear rather awkward.<br />But the brilliant acting of Dalton overcomes all flaws and brings this adaptation to life. Watch out for a most touching scene where Mr Rochester cries and beseeches Jane to stay with him at Thornfield after his &quot;secret&quot; is revealed and she decides to go away after finding out that they couldn't marry. A kleenex-moment, that.<br />And yes, this production includes the brilliant &quot;fortune-telling gypsy&quot; scene from the novel where Mr Rochester tries to find out Jane's innermost thoughts and feelings concerning him.<br />Truly, Dalton's portrayal of Mr Rochester is what makes this adaptation so memorable and romantic. One wonders whether it will be as effective and as highly recommended had another actor been chosento play Mr R instead.<br />If you love a good period romance or if you're an ardent fan of the novel, then you'll be well pleased with this production. Don't just rent the video, I recommend that you buy it because you're sure to want to watch it over and over again.
B00005Q45W|5.0|The 2001 album Ten New Songs is quite subdued and at first listen all the songs have the same slow gentle sound. But the old magic's still there on classics like In My Secret Life, Love Itself, The Land of Plenty and the elegant Alexandra Leaving.<br /><br />Cohen covers familiar themes and one even recognizes lines from earlier songs, e.g. \\"I do what I am told,\\" (That Don't Make It Junk), while the mood of The Land Of Plenty reminds me of Heart With No Companion from the [[ASIN:B0012GMW7A Various Positions]] album, a devotional with a sentiment of complete resignation and acceptance.<br /><br />By The Rivers Dark refers to Psalm 137 about remembering Zion and singing a song to the Lord by the rivers of Babylon. The most explicitly spiritual song The Land of Plenty is the highlight of the album and stirring in its melancholy and honesty: \\"For the Christ who has not risen/From the caverns of the heart/For the innermost decision/That we cannot but obey/For what's left of our religion/I lift my voice and pray/May the lights in the land of plenty/Shine on the truth some day\\".<br /><br />I enjoy Cohen's unusual excursions like [[ASIN:B0012GMVY4 Death of a Ladies' Man]] and the esoteric [[ASIN:B0012GMX3S Recent Songs]] as much as his classic acoustic style so I have no problem with the synth-pop production. I love Sharon Robinson's vocals as backing and where she duets with him on tracks like Boogie Street and the exquisite Alexandra Leaving.<br /><br />For more than four decades Cohen has been constructing a magnificent body of work that stands up to serious scrutiny and the passage of time. What a pleasure then, for these ten additional songs of the same sublime artistry as his first offering of the new millennium. The follow-up, 2004's [[ASIN:B0002MPTDO Dear Heather]] is even better and more varied.
B00004RJ71|5.0|This movie has got to be one of the greatest chicano movies ever created. For those who enjoyed American Me, This movie blows that out of the water. The actors in this movie are really heartfelt. Throughout the whole movie your emotions are on a rollercoaster. The movie has some very devasting parts that break your heart, and some parts that keep you on the edge of your seat. The story of three chicano teens growing up, and how a couple decisions changed the paths of their lives. The only bad acting had to be Miklo, but the movie itself makes up for any flaws. This has to be added to any hispanics movie collection. If your not hispanic don't be discouraged, my best friend is white and he can quote every line in the movie. BUY this movie today. Before I go, does anyone know what's the deal with Benjamin Bratt on the back cover? He's holding a girl that is never shown in the movie. Bye
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Yes, the story is cheesy and Ewan and Nicole aren't the best singers in the world, but if that's what you're looking for in this film, you're missing the point.  I don't think the film makes any pretensions about what it is, you need to just sit back and be absorbed into this is a tragic and amusing story.  Visually, the film is stunning and you can't help feeling part of it.  The attention to detail is fabulous, and the `behind the scenes' stuff on the DVD enhances the enjoyment.<br />While the film works best on the big screen, it does transfer pretty well in widescreen format.  You're going to get the most out of the film with a decent sound system.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I bought this movie about two months ago and my son can't stop watching it! I admit I sometimes catch myself sitting down and enjoying it with him. I have a VHS version that I've had since a kid, but that is nothing compared to the true color and EXCELLENT restoration they did on the DVD version. Disney has really outdone themselves. As for it not being compatible, I play it on my Playstation2 and it works just fine (haven't tried a pc or xbox) I must encourage everyone to add this to your disney collection. One thing I didn't like though was some of that extra stuff they put in was pretty lame. The movie though was top of the line.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Okay, I realize that as an adult I get alot of grief for liking Britney's music, but you know what?  I don't care.  This girl has an amazing voice, and she is a great role model for any girl.  She does what she wants, and doesn't let people tell her what she is doing is too &quot;grown-up for her age.&quot;  She is a young woman and she wears what is popular.  <br />This album is amazing and you can really tell that she has grown up both in real life and in her singing since her debut album.  I like all of her albums, but this one is just the best of them all.  Her voice is great on this album and the songs are so much more meaningful than before.  Don't get me wrong &quot;Lucky&quot; is still my all-time favorite Britney song, but this album is wonderful all the way around.  I also think this is her most revealing album in the sense that she is singing what she feels.  I understand that negative things are displayed about Britney, but not all Pop stars are &quot;one hit wonders.&quot;  Britney has definitely proven she is not a one hit wonder.  <br />Great Job Brit, keep up the great work.
B00000IQMT|5.0|This is it! The soundtrack that started it all. This was the soundtrack that made music an important aspect of Hollywood filmmaking. John Williams wrote very good themes for this movie and he used his themes better than any other film composer ever has. He plays the themes for the characters in many variations to suit what the characters are going through. As you listen to these themes in different variations, it doesn't even feel like it is basically the same melody that you are listening to -- this is clearly the work of a master. Great music for the action scenes. Excellent work overall. I love the entire CD. Can't complain about anything. This is great music superbly performed by the London Symphony Orchestra who went on to perform the other Star Wars scores as well as many other Williams scores. <br />After so many years of not writing any Star Wars music John Williams returns to do his work, this time using choruses better than any other film composer ever has. This soundtrack alone makes all of the choral work of James Horner look like rubbish (and Horner does choral work in ALL of his albums!!). And I thought John Williams' age means that his work will start getting weak. God was I wrong! This is better than any of the music in the original trilogy. Each track has a lot of new music in it and shows that this man JOHN WILLIAMS is a genius. This is great.<br />John Williams wrote A LOT of music for this album, enough music for five films. There are so many different melodies.<br />Really great! JOHN WILLIAMS RULES!!

B000002GYR|4.0|Tom Waits' sounds quite a bit different on this early (First?) CD. The voice is not as rough, it is a more tuneful instrument. The music is a bit brighter than in his later work. You hear the beginning of the bittersweet narrator of so many wonderful songs. &quot;Martha&quot; and &quot;I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You&quot; stand with any ballads that Waits' has written and &quot;Lonely&quot; is haunting in its simplicity. Although Waits' later work is more to my liking, Closing Time stands up well against any of Waits' material.
B000002LMK|4.0|After a long, wrenched period of experimentation with everything from bebop to new wave to Republicanism, Neil Young rediscovered his knack for hulking hard rock on his superb 1989 album, Freedom. On its follow-up, 1990's Ragged Glory, Young continues the trend by reuniting with Crazy Horse for an entire album of lively, airy riff-rocking. The album includes many highlights (\\"Over and Over\\" \\"Country Home,\\" and \\"F*!#kin' Up\\" all particularly stand out), but its best song is probably \\"Days That Used to Be,\\" a strikingly harmonized, masterfully arranged rollicker featuring poignant, heart-felt lyrics about growing older and gaining nothing but nostalgia (\\"Talk to me, my long lost friend/Tell me how you are/Are you happy with your circumstance/Are you driving a new car/Does it get you where you want to go/With a seven year warranty/Or just another hundred thousand miles away/From days that used to be.\\"). It is this sort of feisty guitar-rock, encased in a gorgeous reflective tone that made previous collaborations between Young and Crazy Horse so excellent and that was so greatly missed during Young's chaotic period. Ragged Glory is a strong continuation of his highly welcome comeback.
0345350499|4.0|I cracked this book at the book-store after hearing my mother talk about the movie.  I was amazed. I was grabbed right from the first few pages, from it's content, style, and strong grace.  I bought the book and enoyed reading it for a little over a week.  It is amazing that I was interested in this book for I was never one to be interested in King Arthur and his tale but this book is written with so much power and beauty that it's passion entices you. I was woo'd in by it's tempting grace and am ever glad. This book is a wonderful read, journey. It transcends being about King Arthur and his crew. It is interesting for it is written mostly through the female characters of this famous tale. THe characters are strong, real and powerful. This woman could write and I am glad that I stumbled up on her work and her great style.  <BR>   The reason why I give it Four stars instead of Five though I would prefer to give it 4 and a half, is that the ending is weak.  I ,who didn't know the Story of King Arthur, beyond the Disney Movie, did not know the ending.  ANd perhaps this ending is different from the norm. The ending left me unfullfilled but the book is so wonderful that the ending is irrelavant. There are so many great stories within the overall story. Great book, great characters, strong message/s, nicely written, . I'll probably read it again some day.
B000002KD9|4.0|By the release of After the Gold Rush in 1971, Neil Young had already shined in the rosters of two legendary rock bands (Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young), embarked a premature 1969 self-entitled solo debut and collaborated with the garage rock band, Crazy Horse, on Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere. Quite ripe for a flourishing solo career, the finely-crafted After the Gold Rush did much to define the musical persona that would make Young a legend. Young's primary role was always that of a sweet, sentimental folky, in the same vain as his CSNY bandmates. On After the Gold Rush, Young dishes out downbeaten reflection (\\"Tell Me Why,\\" \\"Don't Let It Bring You Down\\"), rainy country rock (\\"Oh, Lonesome Me,\\" \\"Cripple Creek Ferry\\") and gorgeous, softly sung odes of encouragement (\\"I Believe In You,\\" \\"Birds\\"), all encased in golden acoustic guitar licks and painted in Young's masterful use of imagery (\\"Old man lying by the side of the road/With the lorries rolling by/Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load/And the buildings scrape the sky/Cold wind ripping down the allay at dawn/And the morning paper flies/Dead man lying by the side of the road/With the daylight in his eyes\\"). But After the Gold Rush also revealed another quintessential truth about Young's figure: The fact that this gentle singer/songwriter had a streak of embittered social conscious (the title track, the dead-on \\"Southern Man\\") and a flair for lumbering hard guitar rock (\\"When You Dance You Can Really Love,\\" \\"Southern Man\\"). It is with a similar approach that Young would become one of the most influential and acclaimed songwriters of his era. Naturally, After the Gold Rush is the sound of inspiration arriving, doors cracking open and an artist being baptized.
0553208845|5.0|This book is a spiritual masterpiece.  Hesse writes with such simplistic and eloquent grace that just pours off the pages. I read this book shortly after reading Narcisus and Goldmund and was shocked to find that this one was even better. It is a masterpiece. It is very short but stays with you for a long time.  Hermann Hesse was so far ahead of his time writing about Buddha from the west then when now today The Dalai Lama's book line up along the best seller shelves.  Siddartha is incredible and profound.  You can feel clearly the imagination that Hesse had of these times, this world, and this spiritual philosophy.  I could read this book again and again. If you are interested in Buddhism, or eastern thought at all you would be ever so pleased by this wonderful eastern tale of of Buddhism and boundless love that is written with such beauty.  Enjoy it as I have.  It is 100% heart
B000002KDI|5.0|Through critical disregard, cultural change and personal tragedy, Neil Young rode out the seventies, triumphantly producing a wealth of unforgettable, influential material, always traveling on the backs of his two primary personas: solemn singer/songerwriter and rampant axe maniac. Young ended the decade with Live Rust, a live album that features both of those identities rising to such shining life that most of Young's studio recordings from the time (as impressive as many of them are) are almost disappointing when played immediately after the 1979 double album. The first LP mostly features Young's gentle, acoustic persona being poignantly expressive on songs like \\"The Needle and the Damage Done\\" and \\"After the Gold Rush\\" and genuinely charming on \\"Sugar Mountain\\" and \\"I Am a Child.\\" (An unaccompanied musician in front of thousands of people is a perfect voice for these two songs of childish wonderment). The second side features Young's fiery, electric being, backed by immense presence of the buzzing, garage rock band, Crazy Horse, searing across gorgeous, reflective-toned guitar workouts such as \\"Cortez the Kill\\" and \\"Like a Hurricane\\" and batting through sneering, anthemic knucklehead rock like \\"Sedan Deliver\\" and \\"Hey Hey My My (Into the Black)\\" stunningly. Without a single flawed track, the album delivers a prism of power, spunk and radience. The seventies was a decade so filled with unanticipated triumph for Neil Young that the most appropriate way for him to end it was to top everything he had ever done during those years and, on Live Rust, he did.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I don't see how all of these critics are giving this cd such bad reviews! I LOVE it! No Doubt is by far the best band in the world! In my opinion ND has not sold out, they do sound different but still have their wonderful fun sound. This album is a lot happier than ROS (I absolutly loved ROS). Rock Steady does have mechanical sounds but is not techno. My favorite songs are &quot;platinum blonde life&quot; &quot;detective&quot; and &quot;Don't let me down&quot; Those three songs are pretty much the &quot;old&quot; No Doubt that we all love. But I do recomend this to anyone!! It is not repetitive as some say (buy it don't just stream it to your computer! it's just looped that way and you don't hear the whole song) and I happen to like the intro! It is a clip of &quot;Rock Steaddy&quot; and it lets you know what you're in for, great fun!!!
0553274503|4.0|Using a highly original and intriguing premise, Daniel Keyes shed light on America's mentally challenged population with Flowers for Algernon. The novel consists of the journal of Charlie Gordon, a retarded adult selected for a experimental surgical procedure meant to increase his intelligence. Charlie is gleeful at the opportunity to become as smart as an average adult. But, as the experiment succeeds (and the narration's sloppy English slowly becomes more scholarly), Charlie's broadening comprehension and maturing emotions leave him prey to new hardships, such as the revelation that he is an object of mockery at the bakery where he sweeps floors, moral disagreement with the doctors who designed the experiment and a need to understand the parents who had forsaken him years ago. These complications lead to a few instances where Keyes seems unsatisfied with developing a tremendously interesting sci-fi concept and grapples with vague, inconsistent philosophical ideas. Still, the author deserves acclaim for his significant skill for character development, compelling insight into this almost invisible portion of the population and stunning originality.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I really found this movie amusing as far as visual effects and costume design. The music is recycled, as anyone can tell, but is used well and doesn't overpower the story. There are some funny moments, and for those of you sesitive ones out there, it can be quite a tearjerker approaching the end. The only annoying part is the fact that the writers, apparantly, couldn't decide what type of film to write...it isn't entirely a romance or entirely a comedic spoof. Perhaps, however, this is what makes the movie all the more interesting.
B00000JFV9|4.0|After Marvin Gaye's 1971 classic, What's Going On, a new sense of social awareness developed in soul music. One of the best aftershocks of What's Going On was Superfly, a 1972 release from former Impression, Curtis Mayfield. Unlike Gaye, who confronted a prism of social issues, Mayfield has his eyes set on the inner cities and the criminal world infused in it. Being a middle-class, white male, I did not exactly relate to Mayfield's elegant words, but I certainly felt them. Superfly is an album of such strong conviction, remarkable poetry and masterful imagery that it could take any audience into the ghetto and allow them to vicariously experience that world's tragedy (\\"Freddie's Dead,\\" \\"Little Child, Runnin Wild), corruption (\\"Pusherman\\") and grave moral decisions (\\"Eddie, You Should Know Better,\\" \\"No Thing On Me\\"). Mayfield never comes across as preachy or bitter; he merely seems like an intelligent man caring for a community living in decadence and danger.<br />If there is one thing proven by the post-What's Going On reformation of soul it is that one does not need to sound like Bob Dylan to make such statements. A pleasing voice and lush, jazzy instrumentation are also capable of delivering socio-political musings and Superfly features fine displays of Mayfield's sweet, soothing, lovably prepubescent-sounding vocals and a handsomely layered, easy-flowing instrumental backdrop. As rich as Superfly's sound is, Mayfield should not have taken the liberty to include the album's two forgettable instrumentals (\\"Junky Chase\\" \\"Think\\"). I docked the album one star because of that wrong turn. Still, the album is remains testament to Mayfield's skillful songwriter, lyrical radiance and superb taste in musical backdrops and an essential album of that era in soul music.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I have read the reviews many people have posted, but was dissmayed by the writtings of one man. In his review he clearly stated that,although he was a Beatles fan,he did not enjoy the collection. If any one else has read this I would strongly encourge you to pay it no mind. As I am only 16 I never had the chance to buy any Beatles albums. I am overjoyed that there is a collection of their great works. Just beacuse the sound quality isn't the greatest is no reason to be bitter. You must understand that these were recorded long ago and modern technology was not at their fingertips. I woulg strongly encourage you to buy this CD. I have only degraded it one star because of a certin fondness in my heart for &quot;If I Fell&quot; and &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; which were not included in the collection. With that I will conclude with a recondmendation to sit down with your family and watch &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot;, or dare to turn it to that oldies station.You could change your child's life forever.
0395389496|3.0|This is going to be short.  It is not what I expected.  It's not special like \\"Twas the Night Before Christmas\\" where you feel wonder and anticipation.  This story is just plain and average.  I am including this review to compensate for the overestimated rankings given to this book in this web site (and which by the way convinced me to purchase it).  In my opinion, unlike \\"Twas the Night Before Christmas\\" you don't have to have this book added to your collection of special Christmas stories.
B00005QEO2|4.0|Another greatest hits collection from Aerosmith, but actually nothing to do with the band rather complexly.  Geffen have thrown together the best of Aerosmith from their years with the label (roughly 1985 to 1996), but the band were not consulted in any way about the project.  So is that a good or a bad thing?<br />&quot;Young Lust&quot; is one of those rare collections.  We thankfully do not just get the hits, we also get a number of non-studio album tracks, a few rarities and those album tracks that are fan favourites but did not receive radio play, or a single release.<br />Starting at the beginning is a trio of tracks from the much maligned &quot;Done With Mirrors&quot; album from 1985.  Recorded during the tail end of Aerosmith's drug and alcohol abuse, the album failed to perform well in the charts, and only moderately from a critical and creative point of view.  Still, the best of it is here - the Joe Perry Project tune `Let the Music do the Talking', catchy rocker (and album best) `My Fist Your Face' and brooding Led Zep-styled `Shame On You'.<br />Comeback album &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; is well represented with the three hits (`Dude (Looks Like a Lady)', `Angel', `Rag Doll') and the best of the rest included (outstanding cut `Hangman Jury' and `Heart's Done Time' along with the title track).  The trick is repeated with their career-best release, &quot;Pump&quot;.  The popular hits, `Janies Got a Gun', `Love in an Elevator', `What it Takes' and `The Other Side' are all here, and they are ably accompanied by the unnerving raunch of `Young Lust' and Tyler's story of addiction, `Monkey on my Back'.  Shame that `FINE' is not included mind you.<br />The first disc finishes off with the reasonable `Ain't Enough', a Japan-only recording, and the career-saving `Walk this Way' re-recording with Run DMC, as fresh now as it was 15 years ago.<br />The peak of Aerosmith's commercial success came with &quot;Get a Grip&quot; and there cannot be many fans who don't own it.  So it is too Geffen's credit that they have tried to vary things a little by including alternative versions of big hits `Amazing' (orchestral version) and one of the decades best tracks, `Living on the Edge' (acoustic).  The inevitable inclusion of the over-exposed `Cryin' and `Crazy' is expected, and also here are mediocre rockers `Eat the Rich' and `Shut up and Dance'.  Thankfully we also get the brilliant `Head First' and funky `Don't Stop' (only available as B-sides before this) as well as Europe-only release, `Can't Stop Messin'.  Sountrack releases `Love me Two Times', a cover of the Doors classic, and Beavis and Butthead Experience recording, the superb `Deuces are Wild' (why this wasn't an album track I will never know) are thrown in for good measure also.<br />Completing the album are the two new recordings for the &quot;Big Ones&quot; greatest hits release in 1994, `Blind Man' and the better of the two tracks, `Walk on Water'.  The last four tracks are taken from the live Geffen release, &quot;A Little South of Sanity&quot;, a handy way for them to include tracks recorded for Columbia on 1997's &quot;Nine Lives&quot; - `Falling in Love' and `Hole in my Soul' as well as 70s classics, `Sweet Emotion' and `Dream On'.  Pity that they couldn't give us a live version of `Pink' somehow.<br />This is pretty much a flawless collection, although who is going to buy it is another thing.  Die-hard fans will have much of it (although it is a convenient way of getting your hands on hard to find stuff like the B-sides), while casual listeners may be put off by the fact that they don't recognise around a dozen or so of the tracks.<br />But you can't knock 34 tunes, and this is the best representation of the bands career during this time. Get your hands on the &quot;Greatest Hits 1973-1988&quot; as well and you will have a great cross-section of one of rock's finest bands all in 2 albums.own it.

0440234743|5.0|What great opening chapters. Troy Phelan is a billionaire who owns companies worldwide. He has everything. Yet his money is the root of his misery. He is tired of living and plans to kill himself.<br />He sits in a room on the top floor of the fourteen storey building which he owns. He has gathered his family on a floor below. It is time to divide the money. A dying old man should not hate, but he cannot help it. They dream of unlimited cash, but their lives will be forever altered by the secret of The Testament . . .<br />The plot is driven by legal undertones, but it is the adventure that captivated me: the search deep within the jungles of Brazil, the Pantanal. I've enjoyed most of Grisham's legal thrillers, but this book is unlike any of his others. The Testament eclipses all of them.
B000006TZ8|5.0|There's a difference between an o.k. album and a good one, All Mod Cons is neither, All Mods Con is a masterpeice. it has a level of quality that few albums have, great songs, great production, and great fade ins and fade outs, no this is not just a collection of songs all laced together in any random order.  A very well thought out sequence has the album's lone cover The 60's-ish psychedelic/mod/pop sound that is David Watts (a Kinks song) followed, by &quot;English Rose&quot;'s acoustic guitar and ocean waves, And when the singing kicks in, and thats when it hits you how good this album really is.  &quot;In the crowd&quot;'s bass lines, guitar riffs, and melodies, is one of the many gentle gems in the album.  And then just when you think you're listening to a 60's pop album, &quot;Billy Hunt&quot;'s Guitar intro punches in, reminding you, The Jam were many things, including a great Punk Band.  Well I guess i should end there, thats Tracks 4-7. but I should mention my favorite tracks right now are (2) &quot;To be someone (didn't we have a nice time)&quot; and (8) &quot;It's too Bad&quot; but honestly the whole album is a pleasure to hear from the &quot;1,2,3,4&quot; Whisper/intro to the haunting closer &quot;Down in the the Tube Station at Midnight.&quot; Albums just don't get better than this one, folks.
B00003CXTG|3.0|If you were looking to this movie for historical accuracy, you might as well have watched the documentaries over Pearl Harbor. People have to consider the factors. When was the movie released? May around the time teenagers got out. Who was the movie generally targeted to? Teenagers...just look at the leads and there's your answer.<br />I'm not knocking the leads because I'm actually a pretty big fan of Josh Hartnett (that's gone back to the Faculty and did NOT start with this movie). Because of the role, he's been catapulted into a bunch of other movies. Kate Beckinsale did a good job with her acting. The true disappointment was Cuba Gooding, Jr. because his acting did NOT need to be stifled and there needed to be more of it. I wouldn't say that his moments in the movie were a waste, except I wish there was a little more to his role. Jon Voight was great as the president.<br />Here's my main point. If you're looking for historical accuracy, this probably isn't the best movie for you. The love story is a little lax, but there are actors who stand out...i.e. Josh Hartnett, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Jon Voight, and James King. Basically, watch and then judge for yourself. It's only my opinion.
B00005R2BG|5.0|I have usually shyed away from musicals thinking them boring, but this movie changed everything. I absolutley loved it. Ewan MacGregor and Nicole Kidman are incredible together as actors and singers. The sets, costumes, make-up, music, acting, dancing, everything was incredible.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This is what you get when you combine a badly written soap opera and a one-sided, shallow propaganda film.<BR>The movie was obviously an attempt to replicate The Titanic's formula: take a historic event and lace it with a love story. However, in this case, they failed miserably. The characters are shallow, the dialogues and the script ridiculous, the acting - well even all of Hollywood's stars couldn't save this doomed project. <br />Put all that aside, the Pearl Harbor attack sequence, which is about 30 minute longs in the middle of the movie, is worth watching, especially if you have a good home theater system. If not, well you didn't miss much....
0553712837|4.0|Fix yourself a cup of hot chocolate, sit in your favorite reading chair, and spread a warm blanket over your lap.  This is a perfect read to help you get through the frantics of the holidays or to deal with those post holiday letdowns.  You will chuckle and, no doubt, relate to our main character as he steps into frozen puddles, gets trapped in traffic, deals with cranky cashiers and faces the realities of our overly expensive and crazy Christmas traditions.  We've all thought about &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; haven't we?  But in the end, we face the madness and joy of it all for our family -- and sometimes even for the friends we never really knew we had.
B00003CX5P|5.0|By now, most people have probably seen The Phantom Menace, and either you like the movie, or you hate it. I thought it was good, even though Lucas decide to make this one a little more juvenile than his previous Star Wars films.<br />As for the DVD itself, it is full of extras, spilling ove on to 2 disks. As a fan of Star wars, it was nice to have all the extra information on the making of the film, deleted scenes, and all the other features and &quot;easter eggs&quot;, or hidden features of the disks. The directors commentary was good to have, so you can see what was going on in the minds of Lucas, McCullom, and the other designers and filmakers who worked on Episode One.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|An excellent Dylan album continues his recent resurgence.  A very unproduced, old rock and roll sound.  Dylan's voice is raspy and raw, but he continues to write unbelievable songs.
B00005QDW1|4.0|As I've read in interviews No Doubt was a bit miffed at the fan reaction to ROS, it seems the depressing lyrics and solemn tone of the last album failed to catch on.  So, they decided to let it all hang out, so to speak.  This album is pure fun and blows away all the other pop records released this year by a wide margin.  You have to have a stick implanted in your ...[butt] to not tap your foot a little during Hella Good.  Hey Baby keeps the \\"Rocksteady vibe\\" going and it doesn't stop.  The album is actually a consistently worthwhile listen, there is little filler.  True, the lyrics aren't exactly life-changing, but this is pop for gods sake.  So, I believe this album lags behind Return of Saturn in terms of lyrical content, but Rocksteady shows No Doubt as able pop song writers that can craft a beat and melody as good as anyone.  Its a different No Doubt, but damn it I hope they keep changing because they are always fresh and there is basically no one you can say that about in the pop world.
B00005JKHP|2.0|Over all I was disappointed with this Director's Cut of the film. While the remixing of the soundtrack was an imporvement (the addition of the classic bridge sounds was an especally nice touch), I found it un-necessary to edit or &quot;shorten&quot; any of the scenes from the 1979 theatrical release, and the story once again suffers from the lack of plot explanation scenes from the 1983 television version.  Further the replacement in the soundtrack of several background effects (the original computer warning &quot;red alert&quot; system is replaced with the serine from the original series) is awkward at best.  While the new special effects shots were a nice touch they add little to the overall feel of the film.  I still find I enjoy the 1983 &quot;Special Edition&quot; (yes, even with the scene of Kirk on the set) best.  My ratting: A for intentions but a C for overall effect.
0805062971|5.0|I have read a lot of reviews here and elsewhere that reflect on how Palahniuk has written for the young men of a certain generation.<br />So who would predict that this book would speak so clearly to an old married couple going through mid-life crises at 47 years, and their 15 year old daughter?  But it did.  Volumes.<br />Because this was not just a book about guys fighting.  It is, for the 3 of us at least, a portrait of our lives lived by rote, looking for that stimulus that will make us come alive again.  Just the stuff for mid-life crises and teenage angst...<br />In a tightly worded, flawlessly constructed tale, Palahniuk demonstrates a keen insight into our life and times.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|I bought this unseen for I had not seen it in the theaters (now wishing I did) and going only by the reviews I have read here on Amazon. <br />Well I finally watched it last night and all I can say is Wow! Colorful, and blinding. My boyfriend and I had fun trying to figure out the names of the songs that were being sung! and we only missed on one or two, we laughed when we heard Nirvana and loved the Roxanne Tango and we also sang along to Queens &quot;The show must go on&quot;
B00005NWM3|4.0|Silver Side Up is a great alblum, but not nearly as good as The State, their first major label release. The first five songs on this CD are definately the best, the latter 5 are kind of a matter of personal taste. If you like this CD you'll love the State and I also recommend, if you can find it, Curb, an earlier release, not a major label though.
B000000WA4|5.0|I have plenty of time, but I can't be bothered making this long.<br />THIS ALBUM IS SO SIMPLE YET SO, ?<BR>It'll make you laugh, cry, pissed off, angry, and, em.. well lots more.<br />I'll probably get slated for this but, disc 2 is better. Wow! I done it. tracks 1-14 (including Tales Of A Scorched Earth, which i used to HATE ALOT) ar brilliant. The highlight track of the album is of course 1979. I luv that song. On disc 1 the highlights are Zero, Mellon Collie, TOngiht, Bullet, F.U (An Ode to no one). On disc 2 it's : Where boys fear to tread, 1979, xyu, 33 and tales of a scorched earth.<br />THIS ALBUM IS CLASS!<br />Summary : You may hate this at first. I did, for some reason. The first pumpkins album i got eas Machina (My fav). this is now my second fav. of all time (ahead Nimrod and Ixnay, greenday and offspring).<br />THE MOST GROWING AND EMOTIONAL ALBUM EVER MADE. JUST BUY IT.<BR>XYU LATER!
078324228X|1.0|I  went to see this movie because I thought it would be interesting. As I learned earlier this movie is based on a true story about the true Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter and how he was framed for shooting some guy. I also think that he was wrongfully accused and shouldn't have been arrested. I think that this movie is even more boring than the pokemon movie. I went to see &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; it is WAY better than &quot;The Hurricane&quot;. I think that the elderly would enjoy this movie the most because they actually remember this event in time. Another Group of people that would enjoy this movie would be the young because of its message to tell little kids not to do what the actual Hurricane did.
B00005R87Q|5.0|when i saw this movie i wasnt all excited for the cars.  to be honest i saw it becasue Vin Diesel was in it.lol...but i did not leave dissapointed.  after seeing the movie i do have a greater appreciation for racing.  wether it be illegal or not.  it takes talent and skill.  the movie was highly entertaining and it grabed me from the begginning.  as soon as it comes out i am defintly buying it.
B00005N9CV|4.0|This is a departure for Ms. Krall, but one that is well done.  I enjoyed, in particular, listening to Mr. Ogerman's arrangements.  Can't remember when I last heard him, maybe some twenty years ago.  But, it's great to hear his work again.  When I first heard tracks from the album, I thought 'Ogerman??', and was pleasantly surprised to discover it so.<br />As a musician, I'm always looking to hear new material, or in this case, unfamiliar material.  My favorite track is &quot;I get along very well without you&quot;.  Hoagy Carmichael is a great American songwriter and this song further confirms his genius for me.<br />Ms. Krall is a decent jazz pianist and while this album does not display her talents, it is still a good piece of work.  Welcome back, Mr. Ogerman.

B000009RC2|5.0|Listening to this album nearly thirty years ago was like hearing music for the first time!  I stil remember the thrill of repeated listenings- the music was so dense upon first hearing that you needed repeated listenings to take it all in.<br />While &quot;Birds of Fire&quot; is incredible- great production, symbiotic unison playing, brilliant solos- I still think &quot;Inner Mounting Flame&quot; is, overall, the finest Mahavishnu Orchesta album.  The tunes are more fully realized.  Some of the tunes on &quot;Birds of Fire&quot; sound like sketches- i.e., &quot;Hope&quot; and &quot;Resolution&quot;. The tunes on &quot;Inner Mounting Flame&quot; sound fully realized from beginning to end.<br />I do miss Jan Hammer's mini-moog, which came into play on &quot;Birds of Fire,&quot; as well as Billy Cobham's additional percussive arsenal featured on the same album.  But these are minor complaints compared to the urgency, beauty, and overwhelming orginality of the music on this excellent debut album.  Listening to &quot;Inner Mounting Flame&quot; makes me wish the I lived in New York City back in the Summer of 1971 so I could've seen them live at the &quot;Gaslight&quot; club.  Wouldn't that've been one incredible experience!<br />I often feel sad when I listen to this album.  This band was so remarkable at this stage of their career.  Only one completed studio album, a live album, and a thrid studio album deemed not worth releasing until 1999 would follow &quot;Inner Mounting Flame&quot;.  Perhaps the seeds for the band's destruction were sown early?  How long could humans play this style of music at such a demanding level night and night without burning out?
B000053VAF|5.0|This movie is, simply put, a masterpiece.  Kevin Smith shows his talent and brilliance in this well written epic.  It's full of laughs at the suface and crawling with deep, philosophical questions beneath.   This movie brought me closer to God than nine years of Catholic grade school ever did.
B00005N9CV|4.0|Diana Krall can't really be compared to any truly great jazz singer because she simply isn't that good. Some of her previous albums have irksome moments in which she doesn't quite hit the mark (which my pianist friend tells me is common for piano players who also sing), or slides into a piercing, painful note. Her control could definitely be improved.<br />That said, when she does hit the note, when she growls out a verse, when she fades to an elegantly simple piano riff, she's magic. The &quot;Look of Love&quot; plays to all of her strengths and none of her weaknesses. She stays well within her limitations and exploits her ability to breathe lyrics.<br />In addition, the radical switch from &quot;All For You&quot;, with its minimalist trio rendition of some old Nat King Cole faves, to the lush, textured &quot;The Look of Love&quot; is wonderful.<br />Technically, the CD seems good. I'm not an expert, but my untrained ear doesn't detect any glaring errors in production or mixing except on a couple of occasions when her voice falls equal to or below the level of the music. This isn't a mistake I'm accustomed to hearing in her albums, and the avoidance of that mistake is one reason why &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes&quot; is such a stellar production.<br />Resign yourself to Diana's being a torch singer rather than a true jazz vocalist, and this album will please.
B00005NG9Z|5.0|Alice in Chains was one of the most talented bands of the 90s.  Falling somewhere in the mix of metal, grunge and alternative these boys from Seattle really tore it up and this video is a great creative representation of this.  The videos and cool extras really make it a worthwhile purchase!  I wish Candlebox would follow suit and release a similar DVD.
B000001FVL|5.0|I have been a closet fan of The Buggles since I heard them 'on the wireless' back in '89. I finally picked up this album today and am glad I did. Video Killed the Radio Star is a classic. Bottom line. Techno Pop sounds like something off of an early Nik Kershaw album, such is the similarity between Kershaw's and Horn's voices, and the overall sound. Great! Elstree is on par with 'Radio Star', and to me is a sort of 'TV Killed the B movie Star'. It is my favourite song on the album. The whole album is way ahead of its time in its sound, lyrics, effects and production and it is a crying shame that Horn and Downes did not have more success at the time.
B00000JGEH|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen, it is almost as good as the second one. the movie is basically about a woman named sarah connor who is going to give birth to a great leader in an upcoming war (humans vs. machines), the cyborg, half-human, half machine (played by Arnold schwarzenegger)is inscructed to eliminate sarah and thusly, prevent the machine's defeat. the soldier Kyle (played by micheal biehn) is sent back through time to protect her and eliminate the cyborg. this fast paced time travel thriller is definetly worth purchasing. Almost eveything is great about it, the action, the story line, the suspense, and even the roar of kyle's pump shotgun is nicely done. Unfortunatley there is a little bit of sadness in it. If you like action, suspense, or even james cameron movies (they are all great) buy this.
6304143206|5.0|It has been nearly twenty years since this movie was released; but even today, E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL remains one of the most fascinating movies of all times.  Steven Spielberg, like Hitchcock, DeMille, and John Ford before him, is no stranger to making masterpieces, and this is unquestionably one of them.<br />Its story of a young boy named Elliott(Henry Thomas) who befriends a very benign alien accidentally left stranded on Earth and takes it upon himself to protect the alien from government agents is so well known that there is really no need to go into extensive detail anymore.  But sprinkled throughout this masterpiece are individual moments that stand out among the greatest single moments ever put on film (the bicycle ride across the moon, the Elliott/E.T. emotional connection).  One scene that has always stood out for me personally is the first meeting between Elliott's kid sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore) and E.T., in which Gertie screams her head off.  It is one of the very few times where I've wanted to laugh and scream in the same breath.<br />Winner of five Oscars, including John Williams' legendary music score, E.T. has grossed over $1 billion, and it's not surprising to see why.  This is most assuredly a story that touched the world, as its advertising says, and it continues to be highly recommended.
B000000I0K|5.0|Everything Mike Oldfield did prior to QE2 was worthy of attention and interest, but much of it was so daunting in the length of compositions and shifts of mood that it could all end up a bit hard to stomach.  QE2 rectifies this situation without sacrificing anything in terms of quality and musical message.  David Hentschel does a fine job in production and the use of a consistent set of backup musicians reflects Oldfield's growing maturity.  The involved compositions are still there in the form of the title cut and Taurus I, but there are also powerful shorter pieces that are miracles of composition and arranging, in particular &quot;Conflict&quot; with its synthesizer doodlings that eventually morph into a passage that would make the best contemporary celtic band blush.  Maggie Reilly is introduced here but provides voice as instrument rather than carrier of lyrics in &quot;Sheba&quot; and &quot;Celt&quot;.  Abba's &quot;Arrival&quot; receives a spirited interpretation and &quot;Wonderful Land&quot; dashes some spanish guitar into a wonderful mix.  Only &quot;Mirage&quot; is a bit overly long although it has some great lead guitar and time changes.  A liberal does of the esoteric wafts over much of this disc which should surprise and please those 70s fans who might have held off for what ever reason from making this part of their collection, but its marriage of the eclectic to the attainable is what makes QE2 one of Mike Oldfield's best overall efforts.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I got this CD for Christmas and loved it! P!nk has never been a nice girl, but she's never been this naughty! Some lyrics in 'Respect' and '18 Wheeler Truck' and a bit much for younger kids, but as long as you're at least 12 (like me) you'll be able to handle it. These songs all have a strong message, which I think makes them better. My favorite tracks (the ones you should listen to the clip are): Don't Let Me Get Me (#2), Get the Party Started (#3), and Respect (#4) Respect is my ultimate favorite, though....
B000003TAR|5.0|this album is a personal key of darkness that opens the doors to the mind of a man named Kurt Cobain. It's a punking grungefest. The whole In Utero album was a trip into agonizing masterpieces of songs that screached. distorted, and calmed the mind of Mr.Cobain...wanna hear?:)
B00003CXTG|1.0|skip to the attack scene and then eject this disc!  this movie was painful to sit through.....
B00005QG9J|5.0|THE BAND: Mike Einziger (guitar), Brandon Boyd (vocals & percussion), Jose Pasillas (drums), Dirk Lance (bass), Chris \\"DJ\\" Kilmore (turntables).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2001) Recorded at the Stern House in Malibu, CA. 13 songs clocking in at approximately 58 minutes. The disc contains a 10-page booklet with song listing, hand written lyrics, assorted black & white band photos, and thank you's. An 8-10 minute video is also on the disc... \\"The Morning View Sessions\\"... a quick look behind the scenes mostly shot with someone's hand-held recorder. Label - Sony.<br /><br />COMMENTS: My absolute favorite disc from 2001. Creed (Weathered), Tool (Lateralus), Nickleback (Silver Side Up), and Jimmy Eat World (Bleed American) all had great albums from the same year... but when I look at the year in review... this is my easy pick for favorite of 2001. \\"Morning View\\" starts out fast with rocking tracks \\"Nice To Know You\\", \\"Circles\\", and \\"Wish You Were Here\\". Transitions to the prettiest song on the CD \\"Just A Phase\\". Continues with a few slower tunes and then hits the slowest (acoustic) song - the melodic \\"Mexico\\". The end of the album, \\"Are You In\\" and \\"Under My Umbrella\\" are happy tunes influenced by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The last song on the CD is \\"Aqueous Transmission\\" - a song with an Japanese statement all over it. Brandon Boyd has excellent vocal range for a rocker. Mike Einziger (guitar) can rock with the best of them, as well as slow it down. His \\"Paul Reed Smith\\" guitars have a wonderfully distinct sound. Through out the entire album, you'll find tight & crunchy riffs (acoustic and electric), accompanied by standout lyrics... thoughtful and imaging provoking. \\"I Wish You Were Here\\" reached #2 on the Billboard Top 200 chart in 2002, as well as \\"Warning\\" #3, and \\"Nice To Know You\\" #9. Also look for Incubus' DVD \\"The Morning View Sessions\\" which gives you several hours of band footage including an intimate concert of the band in top form (12 songs total and 6 of them from \\"Morning View\\"). Great disc.w\\"). Great disc.
0780021967|5.0|Do not waste your money on the Laserlight release of The 39 Steps.  I doubt there are very many people who do not yet recognize the superiority of the Criterion Collection, but if you have any doubts as to the merits of the Criterion release, just compare this edition... and you will appreciate how remarkable Criterion's digital transfer of this film is.  The audio commentary is interesting (though nothing extraordinary); what is special about this release is the clarity of the image (while remaining true to the original source material).  Though I would contend that either Notorious or Rear Window is Hitchcock's best work, I could understand how one might judge The 39 Steps his best film.  If you are only familiar with Vertigo, Psycho, The Birds, North by Northwest, et cetera, I would strongly encourage you to watch The 39 Steps, which expresses the more playful, less sadistic side of Hitch's work.  To categorize this film as \\"early\\" Hitchcock, while factually correct, unfairly subordinates this film, as well as his other work from the 30s, as well as the early 40s, to the so-called \\"later\\" films, as if the latter were somehow more mature and evolved.  In fact, one might argue that the opposite is true, that perhaps one finds alreadly in The 39 Steps the most profound testimony to Hitchcock's vision.  Robert Donat gives a superb and charming performance in the role of the man wrongly accused.  Madeleine Carroll, as in \\"The Secret Agent,\\" is outstanding, and, next to Ingrid Bergman, is perhaps Hitchcock's best leading lady, no offense intended to Grace Kelly or Joan Fontaine.
B000002G6J|4.0|Never being one who would spoil a party ( and in this case a Bossa Nova party at that! )critiquing Antonio Jobim's \\" Wave \\" should be a 'labor-of-love' for me. Anyone perusing my back catalogue of reviews here [...] will have no doubt noticed of my affection for Mr. Jobim and the Bossa Nova style that he almost single handidly created back in the late fifties with Stan Getz ( see \\" Girl From Ipanema \\" ). And his work with singer Astrud Gilberto still ranks extremely high on my desert island disc compilations. I found his work with these artists, plus Sinatra's fine album with Antonio, to be almost flawless. High praise indeed! But, with that being said.... <br />I cannot say with any real truthfulness what I was expecting from \\" Wave \\" but, while I still enjoy the cd immensely, I find that I'm left asking myself...\\" is that all there is? \\" Again, I truly respect the work of this amazing Brazilian composer but, unfortunatey, much of what is performed here sounds perilously close to a sort of 'lounge' music, albeit excellent lounge music at that! The tunes themselves are wonderfully melodic and harmonically very interesting as well but, in the end, after a few listens, there's not much here that leaves any lasting impressions on me. Perhaps I should chalk this up to my 1) being an innocent when it comes to understanding the compositional aspects and the skills involved in the performing of music or 2) my simply having a 'tin ear'! I guess it's probably both. I won't deny that there is probably much more going on here that I am sadly missing and maybe with time I'll be able to pick up on the nuances that fill this album but.... Again, while I enjoyed the cd very much it did leave me with that martini-soaked, cha-cha-cha feeling, ala Henry Mancini style, that was prevelant in the early sixties. Fortunately though I still enjoy ( and somewhat subscribe ) to that lifestyle very much, thank-you! <br />Overall, while though this review is less than sterling I would still heartily recommend adding \\" Wave \\" to your own collection. I still admire Antonio Jobim but, for me at least, I suspect he will be all the better appreciated when his work is performed by other talented singers as well. As for myself, I have found that 'shuffling' this fine disc with Sinatra's incredible cd with Jobim and perhaps throwing in one of Astrud's release's ( see \\" Her Finest Hour \\" ) seems to work, in tandem, very well together. It truly sets the mood for a wonderfully relaxing, bachelor, devil-may-care sort of evening that is hard to deny. Mr. Jobim has more than proven himself to be a virtuoso performer/composer and I wouldn't try to change that legacy for a moment. So enjoy and perhaps give me a passing thought when you pour that first martini! Mmmm.... now all I need is to find is those silk pajamas!
0783240236|5.0|Forget the fact The Birds has never looked better on a television screen, presented here in widescreen format, with surround sound, and in a luminous, digitally remastered transfer.  Forget about the fact that this DVD edition contains an original, outstanding documentary, &quot;The Birds is Coming.&quot;  If you are a fan of Hitchcock, this DVD is worth seeing for the screen tests alone, which are among the most valuable extras a studio can include on a DVD (let's face it, most audio commentaries are mediocre and vastly inferior to what can be found in print).  If there was ever any question regarding the ambivalence of Hitchcock's relationships with his leading ladies, one need only watch these absorbing, yet profoundly disturbing screen tests, in which Hitchcock, in a stern and chilling tone, orders Tippi Hedren to try on various dresses and poses.  As with Kim Novak in Vertigo, one senses a certain desparation in Hitch's direction of Hedren, in both this film and in Marnie.  Tippi Hedren is no Grace Kelly, just as Grace Kelly was no Ingrid Bergman or Madeleine Carroll.  Nonetheless, this is an outstanding picture and a highly recommended DVD special edition.
0060278234|5.0|This is one of the greatest fantasy series i've read since phillip pullman's &quot;his dark materials&quot; series. &quot;Lirael&quot; is a great book, and the ideas in it are--there is no other word for it--ingenious. as w/ all series, it is probably a good idea to read &quot;sabriel&quot; first, as it will give you a better understanding of what is going on. this book left me dying for the conclusion. i couldn't believe it when i turned the page, and there was only &quot;to be continued in 'abhorsen'&quot; waiting for me!
B00005JKES|5.0|First, blame the suits for the lack of a pilot, it's inexcusable, it's stupid, it's even commercially numb -- but why should the release of the Peaks box be any different from any other inanity committed by same?  Still and all, you can find the pilot at ebay, or even from some of the more advanced net dvd sites (I bought a Japanese version).  Cheers.
B00005JKOV|1.0|This movie was an embarrassing attempt to be &quot;artsy&quot; and I use the quotes around the word on<BR>purpose. WAKING LIFE was nothing more then a movie were someone had a great idea for a<BR>interesting concept and that was all.  The film would have worked as a 15 minute short film (tops). <BR>It was almost comically pretentious and the script writer seemed to being trying to be ultra-<BR>philosophical on a subject that is not deep enough to talk about as long as they did.  The question<BR>the film asks is one asked over and over- one that simply makes you go \\"hmm?\\"  and nothing<BR>more.  It was almost like watching people pretend to be intellectual who were not.  This film was<BR>insulting to intelligent audience members and was one of the very worse movies I have ever seen. <BR>The creators cannot fool everyone that they had anything original or interesting to say.
B000059HGY|5.0|This is the movie to see if you want it accurate. This film was a collaboration between American and japanese filmmakers. You cannot get more real than this. Each Country tells their side of the story from their point of view. The Star of this film is the battle scenes. This is the best film of the tragedy that drew us into the Second World War.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|This fun film is full of visual stimulation and great music.  I don't agree with the assesment that the two leads, MacGregor and Kidman, can't sing--they do a fine job.  One of the potential problems with musicals is that they tend to focus so much on the songs that the scenes in between musical numbers can be wooden, or forced, and appear to be in the film just to move the story along to the next song.  There is none on this in Moulin Rouge.  The film is a success both in song and dialog because of superior acting.  Like another successful, &quot;modern&quot; musical called Grease, Moulin Rouge has a cast that inhabits the roles given them, and completely enraptures the audience all the way through to the end.<br />My only complaint with this film is the frenetic, almost seizure-like editing at the introduction to the club.  With so much great choreography and amazing set design, they should have lingered a bit longer on the earlier scenes.  I guess they might have been going for the over-stimulated, perspective of the writer, but the film would have been better served by allowing the audience to be immersed in the club's atmosphere.<br />The DVD is an amazing piece of work, with loads of extras.  For a review on the DVD version, check out ign.com.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie was simply great. A tragic love story. A movie set in 1900 with music from 2000. I thought that is was ingenious much like Baz Luhrmann's &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot; <br />Bottom line... If you liked Romeo and Juliet see this movie. It has the same creative flair.
B00005QCVT|5.0|After a couple of scenes it was clear that the director had a clear vision as to how to tie together the disparate worlds of the four main characters.  Kudos to any director attempting to take on a project this broad in scope.<br />It was clear that the characters were heading down a path that could only lead to doom. Therefore, it surprised me to see the movie take such a comic tone midway through. From that point on, it seemed to get more and more &quot;slapsticky,&quot; culminating in the now classic &quot;HEY...WHERE'S MY ARM?!&quot; scene. All I could think of during that scene (like I'm sure many of you) was Kramer.<br />A comedic romp of the highest caliber!
B00005U2LM|5.0|Wu is back?  Where did they go?  Years and years of material and they keep delivering...and evolving.  As Raekwon once put it, more albums are just for more 'inventory' for the die-hard.  All members provide excellent performances with GZA providing the most complex and dense lyrics, Raekwon's endless slang spilling on almost every track, and Method Man turning out notably more impressive and inspired performances than in recent memory.  Deck reps as usual, best performace being 'Dashing' and he is also awarded the funniest line with the '..Air Olden Polynices..' reference.  Ghost throws some darts (with his verse on 'Rules' calling out bin Laden), which are excellent, but is not seen as much as other members, probably due to the recent release of Bulletproof Wallets.  Masta Killa is greatly underrated and underappreciated, though he definitely is one of the members who reps the kung-fu references which popularized Wu in the first place, and lays down a great performance.  RZA, well, what can you say?  Production is razor sharp, he's seemed to developed more horns and brass elements in his beats as well as adding more classical dj aspects (scratching, Primo style sampling), though this album runs the gamut.  'Radioactive' is traditional Wu style production, 'Chrome Wheels' is straight Bobby Digi, 'Iron Flag' is reminiscient of 'Marvel' mixed with 'Forever' era, while 'Uzi'is the newest stuff.  On the international version, 'The W' is a bonus track.  Old school Wu track, I'm thinking.  Beat and rhyme style is 94-95 era, beat is similar to 'Garment Renaissance' in sound.  Another '36 Chambers'?  No, lyrics are too sharp, style too developed.  Another 'Forever'?  No, 'Forever' was way, way ahead of its time, this is pretty much an evolution of 'The W' sound and is not that large of a jump.  Any complaints?  Absolutely not, well, I wish they didn't scratch out the 'Nine bin Ladens' reference Rae makes in 'Y'all Been Warned'.  Great album, hip-hop all the way.  There will not be another '36' album, Wu-Tang Clan is too creative for that.  What you have here, as with every Wu album, is innovation and creativity striving for perfection.
0767802659|4.0|This is a pretty good movie, it's exciting, easy on the eyes and has a decent plot.  It's based loosely on the book although the movie can't really decide whether it wants to be inspiring like the book or a satire on war.  Some reviewers have suggested that the book is like this which I completely disagree with.  In my opinion this movie turned out a lot like director Verhoeven's Total Recall -- it started out as a serious, intellectual movie but as work on the movie progressed, the special effects took over and the acting [was bad], so they made it seem like they meant to do that.  And like Total Recall, they pulled it off.  Overall it's a decent flick but completely different in tone and purpose than the book.
0345440757|4.0|If your child was a colicky, spirited, demanding baby, you may know what I mean.  When I was pregnant for my second, I heard about this book and decided to &quot;check it out&quot;.  It did help tremendously (in my mind anyway) on how to listen to the baby.  I don't know if I was just more mellow with the 2nd, or if the book helped me, but I learned it is OK if babies cry.  (My first child was colicky so I wouldn't even go for stroller rides because I didn't want the neighbors to hear him cry and think I was a bad mother).  Anyway....it had some very good points in it describing different types of babies and ways to deal with each.  I think this has truly made a difference in how I am reacting to the 2nd child's cries.  I am more confident in what I am hearing from him (ie. crying for hunger vs. gas).  At times the british lingo was annoying, but it is well written and she definitely has expertise in the area she is writing about.  Would make a great baby shower gift.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Well,to begin this review,I can say that I never expected this score to be this good,like my expectations on Peter Jackson. <BR>Howard Shore?<BR>I thought they would chose John Williams or someone to write the soundtrack for this the most brilliant movie of the year. <BR>What great themes had Howard Shore done before?<BR>Anyway,I forgot all of my low expectations on Howard Shore when I saw the movie. His score was so brilliant that even John Williams`s greatest scores seemed like low-budget jobs!<BR>He is using a 106-piece orchestra and a huge maouri choir with a hundred members. <BR>Vocals play a large matter in this score,especially in the theme for the Black Riders,heard in tracks 5,6,7,and 8. It is a menacing theme,featuring the entire choir in one!<BR>\\"The Prophecy\\" is a great beginning - it consists of some low chorus and mysterious themes,perfect for the legend of the Ring. <BR>But the score is not getting too dark. In fact,\\"Concerning the Hobbit\\" is sounding very uplifting and happy,and a little folk music influenced. It has a rather funny theme for the hobbits. <BR>Then there is also another theme,which I believe is the main theme,heard in track 4,which is also an impressive choral track. <BR>This score also has some beautifull cues,like \\"Many Meetings\\",\\"Lothlorien\\" and \\"The Great River\\". Here,some light female choir is heard,as well as feelsome strings, and in \\"Lothlorien\\", there are also some middle eastern instruments featured. <br />Then, we also have the orch theme, which appears twice on this album - this is a theme that outclasses \\"Imperial March\\" as a classic movie theme of evil. It`s an enormous, militaristic march with a huge brass and percussion section. It sounds very mean, almost mechanic. <BR><BR>Except for those memorable themes,it also has some really great action cues,the best one beeing \\"The Bridge of Khazad Dhum\\",which has about five minutes of non-stop action music as they are fighting Balrog,the most horrific villain of the first book.The deep, fast-pacing background chorus combined with thundering percussion makes this track sound a little exotic,like the action tracks of James Newton Howard's \\"Dinosaur\\",but much darker. <BR>\\"Amon Hen\\" has a huge brass section in the first three minutes,but then it becomes very sad,as Boromir dies.<BR>\\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\" marks the grand finale of the score. Although it is sorrow,it feels quite uplifting,with Enyas voice heard in the end of it. This makes it similar to Lisa Gerrard`s solo voices in \\"Gladiator\\". <BR>Her song at the end of the score is also rather good,and very relaxing. <BR>Over all,I must say that this is some of the greatest film music ever done - it has all of what a great fantasy score should have.<BR>No other composer would have done it better - it must be a little dark to fit into Tolkien`s fantasy world,as it seems more real than most other fantasy movies. <BR>It's a pity that only 70 of the 150 minutes of score appears on the album. Many fans would might pay twice the price to get the entire score,but fortunatley,most of the great cues are included here. <BR>The music is very inspiring,and it fits perfectly when I read about Tolkien`s world,as well as when I draw landscapes. <BR>If making a dramatic drawing,no other music will inspire you as much as this,I promise!<BR>So,now it`s your choice. <BR>If you liked Danny Elfman`s Sleepy Hollow or Hans Zimmer`s Gladiator,then I`m quite sure that you will love this!
B00003CXTF|4.0|I agree. This is no Tora,Tora,Tora. This is a story that just happened to happen around the time of Pearl Harbor. Yet, you can't help but like it. I did get mad when the first guy went to England and the girl ends up with his best buddy, there is still some historical content there to keep you interested. Cuba Gooding's performance of Dorrie Miller was good. The main characters were good, and you could feel yourself right there in the middle of the action. Still I give it a 4 due to the fact that it wasn't all history.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I was amazed at the animation in the theater, it must have covered the rancid taste, as curry did before refrigeration.  My first viewing on DVD left me thinking great movie for MST 3000.  Natalie Wood, Liz Taylor, Mickey Rooney, Shirley--- There are great child actors out there, but you won't find one here, and being the essence of the plot, it's lack sinks the ship.  <br />George has got to go back to the Drawing board, this movie only sports top notch animation.  Its not fit for human consumption.
0440219078|5.0|This book was really great because it showed me a whole new world of rules. I also liked it because it had a totally new way of life in it. I just couldn't put it down. Read it and you will find that it is great.
B00005JKMO|5.0|I was extremly dissapointed in the direction of this movie but Will more than mad up for it. I can think of a half dozen better directors who would not have made the movie look and feel like an eposode of Miami Vice. It think the music was a bit over bearing and the diologue was weak. But Will's dedication to hitting the mark was evident. In fact I think he should receive at least an Academy Award nomination for his effort. Bravo Will... Thumbs down for Michael... Thumbs up in spite of all to ALI!
B00005QDW1|5.0|When I first heard &quot;Hey Baby&quot; on MTV, I was skeptical.  No Doubt is my favorite band and I was looking forward to this album a lot.  Then I heard this song (with the Bounty Killer reggae-rap thing in it) and I was praying that NO Doubt hadn't completly changed.  <br />Let me start off by saying that Hey Baby has grown on me (except for that rap) but it definetly not the best song on this album.  Here is my play-by-play of the CD:<br />1)Intro- This is about 25 seconds long and it is basically a very short introduction to the CD.<BR>2)Hella Good- An amazing, upbeat song with great lyrics.  My brother likes artists like Ludicris and Mystikal and he keeps coming into my room and asking me to play this song.  <BR>3) Hey Baby- Excellent song, except for the rap (have I mentioned that I hate rap?)<BR>4) Making Out- High energy song that is instantly reconizable <BR>5) Underneath it All- A very slow song with the other reggae-rap on this CD in it<BR>6) Detective- A very catchy song that you can memorize quickly. <BR>7) Don't Let Me Down- The first full-out rock song that sounds like Tragic Kindom.<BR>8) Start the Fire- Another rock song<BR>9) Running- A slow song all the way through <BR>10) In My Head- A song that is different from the other songs on the album.  If I had to pick this is my least favorite song on Rock Steady. <BR>11) Platinum Blonde Life- Another rock song that never once says &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot; in it. <BR>12) Waiting Room- Co-written by Prince this is a great song <BR>13) Rock Steady- The title track is techno, slow and fast all at the same time.
B00005MEW1|4.0|If Gothic you want, then Gothic this is-  a pleasant diversion from all the modern, glam, vampire poseur films. Filmed in 1922, Nosfartu is an historic, horror masterpiece. Without fast-action fight sequences, without high-tech special effects, without even dialogue (remember this was filmed in 1922) the film simply exudes gothic ambiance. The score from Cleopatra Records is the perfect audio backdrop to the visual stimulus; And, the music is continuous throughout the film (good thing, this is a silent movie otherwise). You may also want to buy &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula (Coppola)&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Vampire&quot; as they yield more storyline and provide a (fictional?) documentary prelude to Nosferatu. The three films together comprise an interesting trilogy (or shall we say, orgy) of vampire cinema. Having recently viewed these two other films made the viewing of this film far more meaningful.  This is no ordinary movie; don't expect to be entertained in an ordinary manner. Nosferatu is more 'feel' and 'attitude' than blatant bite-my-neck action. After several viewings you may find yourself listening to the soundtrack as primary entertainment, while the movie visuals provide secondary allure. On the complaint side- there were no printed materials included with the DVD-- no track listing, no historical by-lines. Nor does the DVD have any additional features. For these small omissions, &quot;Nosferatu&quot; falls slightly short of perfection, but rates a great 4 out of 5 stars.
B000003N89|5.0|There is nothing like a classic by which to gage a new artist. I had been searching for a new jazz sound that I could connect with and bought Diana's Debut album on a whim. I fell head over heels in love with her voice, her piano, and her group.<BR>Since then I have collected nearly every one of Diana's CDs. The Nat King Cole dedication album was the climax. Selfishly speaking, I wish the recording company would resist the urge to create another Pop Diva and leave Diana to mellow like fine Cabernet in a classy dark cellar for true Jazz afficianados.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I loved Shrek it was so different than most anamated movies its like it had its own life. Like how they poke't fun at all of the mists and leagends of old fariy tales. This is just a brillent family film and the DVD should be in the hands of every family.
B00005U2LM|5.0|This isn't as good as 36 chambers but it's still pretty tight,ya'll been warned and in the hood are tight as hell, some tracks aren't that good,but the good ones overshadow the bad ones,method man really shines on this one,and unlike on &quot;W&quot; this album has less guest apperances,and is just wu-tang,which it should be. Peace
B00005R2BG|5.0|This movie is not for everyone, but if you truly are a romantic at heart, no greater love story has ever been told.  I thought the music was tremendous, I loved Ewan McGregor's voice, as well as Nicoles.  Some of the camera movement was too much, but the scenery, story line, movement of the movie and the music were great.<br />I watched this movie 3 times in 2 days because of the music and the touching love story.  I'm not a critic, but it was much more fulfilling to me as a movie goer than the crash and burn movies like Swordfish.  Nor was there any full nudity, or even risque nudity, no cursing, no drugs, warlords, or fighting.  Just the age old story of love, being love, and being touched by love.<br />Bohemia is &quot;out there&quot; and this movie is not mainstream movie making.  It's not for everyone, but it is for anyone who loves a love story.  I think this truly is one of the most entertaining and touching movies I've ever enjoyed.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I really don't want to like this guy but I do. His music is extremely catchy, unfortunately his lyrics are pretty cliched and often stupid at times like &quot;I Will Survive&quot; (cliched) and &quot;Love 4 Fun&quot; (downright stupid). Enrique is certainly no Shakespeare by any means but he puts out some of the catchiest pop songs I have ever heard like the title track and &quot;One Night Stand&quot;. In my corner of the world, pop music has just as much of a place in music as say music by Radiohead and PJ Harvey do. The only difference is that I don't take Enrique's music as seriously as I would with Radiohead and PJ Harvey. &quot;Escape&quot; is a pure pop pleasure for the ears. The infectious melodies don't ever leave a person's head after listening to this cd. My personal favorite tracks are &quot;Escape&quot;, &quot;One Night Stand&quot;, &quot;If the World Crashes Down&quot;, and &quot;Love 4 Fun&quot; (as corny as the lyrics and title are). If anything, &quot;Escape&quot; is a perfect antidote to what ails society and distracts the listener from the ugliness of reality.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Van Halen were certainly on a hot streak, both creatively and commercially, by the time they released their fourth album FAIR WARNING in 1981.  What boggles my mind, though, is that this album is probably the most underrated LP of their career, as well as the lowest-selling.  A shame, really, because FAIR WARNING is one of Van Halen's best albums.  It may not receive the classic status of VAN HALEN I &amp; II, but it's still a strong, level-headed, consistent batch of tunes.  Plus, the &quot;party band&quot; image from those first albums are gone...for a little while.  If VAN HALEN was the party, then FAIR WARNING is the hangover.<br />&quot;Mean Street&quot; kicks things off in typical VH fashion, with an awesome solo by Eddie as well as energetic grooves from Alex Van Halen and Michael Anthony to perfectly compensate the tough-talking lyrics of David Lee Roth.  A great opening number.  Although the raunchy &quot;Dirty Movies&quot; and the hyperactive &quot;Sinner's Swing!&quot; continue the trends from the first three albums, after that the lyrics become more thoughtful and honest and the music becomes more versatile.  &quot;Hear About It Later&quot; is the catchiest song in the bunch, with a great chorus and meaningful lyrics.  The hard-rocking &quot;Unchained&quot; is just plain awesome.  &quot;Push Comes to Shove&quot; is told from the point of view of a struggling relationship, and it's the best song.  Nice funky bass riff by Michael Anthony and Eddie's slow guitar tone sets the atmosphere.  &quot;So This is Love?&quot; shows off the band's pop sensibilities.<br />If you thought FAIR WARNING couldn't be any darker, in comes the very scary instrumental &quot;Sunday Afternoon in the Park,&quot; with its creepy synthesizer and booming drums, that leads as a brooding segue for the fast-paced &quot;One Foot out the Door.&quot;  Like most VH records during the DLR era, FAIR WARNING is only a half-hour long, but with rock music this good, who needs 60?  Another solideffort, indeed.
6301247485|3.0|Although she was greatly criticized, the ultimate failure of this adaptation does not rest upon actress Mia Farrow; it rests instead upon the on-going failure of film makers to successfully adapt Fitzgerald's sharp statement about American social classes, materialism, and hypocrisy for the screen.  This failure should not be entirely entirely unexpected: the famous story of an ill-fated love affair between a social-climbing bootlegger and a high society woman is not so much the core of Fitzgerald's novel as it is the platform from which makes his statement.  These literary effects simply do not translate well into film, and so once again (as in both other film versions of the novel) we are left with only the plot itself--and shorn of its broader implications the plot emerges as pretty thin stuff indeed.<br />Farrow is actually quite good in the thankless role of Daisy Bucchannan, but since much of the novel's effect is based upon the other characters' opinions of Daisy's character, both script and over-all film fail her efforts.  To a certain extent, much the same can be said for the entire cast, but at least Robert Redford--then at the peak of his golden physical appeal--truly looks the part of the high-style bootlegger Jay Gatsby, and the primary supporting cast (Waterston, Black, and Dern) are plausibly cast.  But in spite of an interesting cast and first rate production values that effectively recreate the hard-edged glamour of the 1920s, the movie never seems to actually start: instead, it feels like one long exposition.  The viewer keeps waiting for the action to begin--and it never really does.  To say the film lacks excitement would be a profound understatement.<br />I hesitate to actually give this film three stars; it really deserves but two.  Still, the art design is remarkable, and the overall look of the film is right, and the cast does the best they can with it, so I'll be generous.  Watch this version of THE GREAT GATSBY for its visuals alone and you'll enjoy it--but if you expect interest from any other quarter, you'll very disappointed indeed.ll enjoy it--but if you expect interest from any other quarter, you'll very disappointed indeed.
B00005AQE8|5.0|No other rapper can compare to this record,but contrary to popular belief,i think Me against the World is better,but still this is amazing,and probably in the top 5 records ever.Wonder why the call you .... is one of Pac's greatest songs,which is alot to say. Peace
B00005N9CV|1.0|Went for the commercial appeal and overreached -- waaaay too sugary. Where's the snap of the 'Errand Girl for Rhythm'gone? Skip this CD, skip 'Love Scenes' CD, and go back to 'When I Look in Your Eyes' for some good stuff. The lady's got a fabulous voice but please let's not drown her in orchestration! And this CD seems mighty skimpy on Ms K's fine piano. Sigh. I had hoped for something to stretch her talents, but this CD didn't do it.
0385501560|5.0|first of all let me say that the satire and the provocative style in which chuck writes is simply amazing. if you want a books that you can apply to life and change your life for the better chuck's books are where its at. i give this 5 stars because, frankly, this is better than the bible. You cant read this and say it isnt a work of art. me and my friends base a lot of lives around fight club, the idea that the world we see isnt exactly the world we live in. i couldnt see giving this book with the same aspects it shares with fight club anything less than a four star rating, and if anyone does i say to them write something as profound as this work and let me read. i can be almost certain it wont be as profound as the works of palahniuk.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is a masterpiece, from start to finish. <br />It is deep, depressing and slow, and yet soft as a feather, and considering &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; and &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot; alone, it is fair to say: this is the work of a genius. (Most of the other tracks are also truly great, especially, in my opinion, &quot;Lucky&quot; and &quot;Karma Police&quot;).<br />But I should warn you: it took me a few &quot;listens&quot; to really get into this album. Because it's so different (I mean original) and groundbreaking, you'll have to be patient. Listen to it three or four times and I garantee it will get to you. Don't just &quot;dump it&quot; after your first &quot;contact&quot; with it. ENJOY IT!
B000008COG|3.0|Ok, lets be rational here. Of course this is not Back in Black, nor Highway to Hell.....maybe the Young brothers are not very proud of this one, but one star?? C'mon, lets get serious...it was 1988 !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Judas Priest had Ram it Down (ugghh!!), Ozzy released the mediocre No rest for the wicked, Van Halen slaughtered us with OU812 and everybody was starting listening to rap!! Believe me, this was a jewel in his time.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I bought this film because A)I love history and historical drama, and B)Family lore has it  that our family lost a loved one who was on the Arizona. I read the reviews and decided to check this film out. <BR>Poignant, funny, and serious, all together. The love story is the back drop for the tragic event that was the beginning of WW2 for the United States. Watching the attack, brought home for me the sacrafices made everyday by our armed forces, then and now. Worth it. P.S. Great acting.
B00005JKQX|2.0|This is one of the worst adaptations of a book I have ever seen. I was looking forward to seeing Russell Crowe play John Forbes Nash, Jr. in the adaptation of what is an excellent book. Instead, what I saw was a movie that happens to have the same title as the book and whose main characters also happen to have the same names as those in John Nash's life, but the resemblance doesn't go much beyond that. <br />The movie does focus on one major element from Nash's life, and that was his schizophrenia. Unfortunately, Ron Howard decided to make almost the whole movie about Nash's schizophrenia. In doing this, the movie resembles an X-Files episode more than Nash's real life -- much in the same way other movies allow themselves to take outrageous and interesting plot twists and then the main character wakes up in the end realizing that the things that happened were nothing more than a dream. Nash's life was so much more than his schizophrenia.<br />The film does have its good points. Russell Crowe gives an excellent performance as an academic suffering from delusions. Also at one point in the first 25 minutes of the movie we get a clever -- but much too brief -- taste of what game theory is about, the field in which Nash's work won him a Nobel Prize.
B00005JKES|5.0|Many people have found Twin Peaks interesting over the years since the series ended. I think the new DVD is great and I can't wait for the next season to come out on DVD. The special features are great. With many interviews with the actors, commentary with people involved in the production. Those of you dissapointed about the pilot not being included in this set you can buy it at any ... Movie store, or on Amazon. I do hope that the pilot will some day come out on DVD. In conclusion this set is far better than any past sets so just buy it!
B00005OM4N|4.0|I must admit that at first I was a skeptic. I thought how real can this over-publicised person be? But I gave her a chance and got a suprise. The album is the best of the three. It has an R&amp;B edge and hip-hop influence to it that I can dance to. Give it a try you might be suprised.
B00003CY0V|5.0|John Travolta, Halle Berry, and Hugh Jackman take you on a wild roller coaster ride of a film. Pay Attention, (or rewind a lot!) or you'll miss something! John creates a manic character who is just sooo evil, and soo funny! He's actually loveable. You have got to see this movie! Buy it!
B00005N9CV|5.0|..at least not as much as her earlier albums. And if you are expecting pure jazz and piano you will probably be disappointed.<br />But if you give &quot;The Look of Love&quot; a chance, you will discover how well it works as a beautiful collection of torch songs and lush orchestration. Each time I listen to this CD I pick up something new and like it even more. Yes, I expected pure jazz at first, and was taken aback a little. But instead I've grown to appreciate this CD for what it really is. Diana took a chance on something new and I think it was well worth it. <br />This CD will probably become one of my all time favorites.
B00003CXTF|3.0|Well I'm a teenage girl and I gotta say, Josh Hartnett is the HOTTEST guy in the world. But I hated the love triangle thing. It was so stupid and you knew that Danny (Hartnett) was going to die because Rafe(Affleck) already &quot;died&quot; once so they wouldn't kill him off again. The action scenes were really good and I thought the movie was sad. All in all, this movie did an okay job at recreating the real Pearl Harbor.
B00005QZWI|5.0|. . . is Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" A story that does not shy away from evil, spiritual struggle, genuine grief or non-romantic love. In fact, the interplay of these emotions and the conflict between good and evil are the foundation of it's mythical story. A rare and special feat indeed to create a film that embodies these same qualities in an age when spectacle and cynicism seem to rule. An even rarer one is when the music is allowed to explore that realm as well. Howard Shore, along with the lovely Enya, not only rise to the occasion, they exceed it. They exceed it by bringing an authentic heart to all the passion and glory that the film has to offer. Howard Shore will win the Academy Award for this score as well as Enya for best song . . . and if you let yourself be taken on the journey with them, you will understand why.<br />This soundtrack covers all the best the film has to offer, and that is much. \\"The Prophecy\\" is a dark and foreboding overture, setting us up for \\"Concerning Hobbits,\\" which is some of the most touching and playful music I have heard in the film world in a long time. The theme of the hobbits and the accompanying theme that represents the love and respect that Frodo shares with Gandalf is one of the more beautiful and touching I have heard . For the darker themes, like \\"The Black Rider,\\" \\"A Knife in the Dark,\\" and \\"The Bridge of Khazad Dum\\" Shore employs a choir, and has borrowed tastefully from Orff's Carmina Burana, something John Williams did as well in the Dual Of The Fates cue from the Phantom Menace. Only here, with a wicked choir singing in the black language of the Dark Lord, using deep repetitive bass drums in an uneven 5/4 time, Shore has taken the music to a darker place, one only found in the most terrifying of nightmares. The themes in these darker pieces are sometimes difficult to tease out only because they are necessarily murky and sinister, but they are there, although I doubt they will be the ones people going away humming. For the more melodic themes there is the recurring melody of the hobbits, played often on an Irish flute, as well as the heroic fanfare theme for the fellowship, amoung other wonderful delights. <br />And then there is the music that is eerily elegiac in the wake of Sept. 11. Often in the heat of battle, to emphasize the loss of the moment, such as Gandalf's fall on \\"The Bridge of Khazad Dum,\\" Shore uses a beautiful voice, that of a single choir boy, over dark and dissonant strings and horns. Other times as in \\"May It Be,\\" Enya supplies the touching lament she is so brilliant at. <br />Take a chance on the film or the books if you haven't already, and then buy this CD. I enjoyed and appreciated this music and the movie, for the adventure as well as the film makers willingness to not let cynicism prevent them from exposing an authentic, and wise heart.
0440213525|5.0|Brilliant!  A real page turner. The book's characters are three-dimensional people you care about -- they seem so real (complete with flaws and problems).  The characters are well fleshed out and the dialogue is very natural.  The young boy talks, thinks, and acts like a boy who has had a disadvantaged life, just as the female attorney acts in accordance with her life experiences.  The movie wasn't bad, but the book is much better!
B000002TQV|4.0|No Radiohead album sounds like another Radiohead album.  The Bends is more guitar based than OK Computer, Kid A, and Amnesiac.  To me, all the CDs are equally good for different reasons. OKC for it's inventiveness (What sounds like it?).  Kid A for it's melding of music.   Amnesiac for it's incredible lyrics.  And The Bends for it's digress from radio standards.  Radiohead is not the same on each album, therefore you cannot compare the album.  This album is great.  It's good on the guitars, good with the electronics.  I'd buy it.

6304298285|5.0|Now this is a diffrent movie from the films that Mr. Williams does. One night a couple named Brain Powell and Karen Powell (Brain Kerwin and Diane Lane) are at a costume party. When thier baby is ready to be born. But the baby is not due for another 7 months. Karen gives birth to a boy which they name Jack. And doctors tell them that the baby was born early because his body is aging 4 times the normal rate. And if this goes on until Jack is 10 years old, that he will be a full grown 40 year old man. So 10 years later Jack (Robin Williams) is a full grown man. And instead of going to school, a tutor (Bill Cosby) comes to the Powell's house to tutor Jack. Until one day the tutor decides that Jack sould go to school. And tell his parents.

0425107469|5.0|Now, I first picked up the book because I'm a sucker for cute dogs.  Imagine my surprise to find out that the rest of the characters and plot were intriguing as well!  My three all-time favorite Koontz books are Strangers, Watchers, and Lightning.
B000002NJS|2.0|first of all i am a fan of madonna. the quality of her material over the years will stand the test of time. But i cannot listen to this cd because it is so badly recorded and overproduced.  The <BR>music itself is quite good.
B000002BVN|4.0|I brought this album when it first came out and I am still not disappointed with it. I still find it complex, exicting and great music. BOTDF offers Jackson's most complete vision of himself to date. Songs about drugs: &quot;Morphine&quot; to self examination: &quot;Is It Scary&quot; are so enthralling and jarring that it makesyou wonder how the public has lost intrest in his sound! When Michael conforms to his past glory as he does brilliantly on his new disc &quot;Invincible&quot; we eat it up but when he offers such complex, unabashed brilliance we ignore the artisty of it. This is the biggest selling remix cd of all time, though. Michael's cds having been leaning towards a paranoia and unself imposed ego issue that comes to full steam with this music and this cd brings the best of all his musics landish hooks an dmelodies to great use.  Remember that Jackson's best songs from &quot;Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough&quot;, &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Something&quot;, through the stuff on dangerous all deal with paranoia and how he feels through the eyes of others.  If you loved the songs then, then you will understand BOTDF now! Even the mixes cough up highly melodized versions of his &quot;History&quot; disc. Well worth the purchase.
0446677450|1.0|I read this book for my Economics class and I hated it! The author said whatever he said on the book simply because he is rich. If he were poor, then he would've said something completely different. I think only rich people can relate to this book, which is weird because this book was written for poor people who want to be rich. Next, the author keeps talking about the same idea over and over again. It is so boring!! This book is also making it seems like education is not as important as it really is. I found this book really disturbing and reprehensible. DO NOT buy this book! [The price] may not seem a lot, but believe me, for this book, that amount seems TOO MUCH! If you are really financially literate\\" like the author thinks all rich people are, you will get smart and spend your money on something else. Whatever it is, trust me, it's wayyy better worth spending than this book!
B00005OWIU|4.0|I like this CD because it is simply good listening for a soundtrack.  Most movie soundtracks leave me enjoying little more than the opening and closing themes, however Potter is one that I can sit through with some interest.  (Most incidental music loses it's meaning without the visual compliment). Granted, the themes are somewhat repetitive, but then that's what movie music is all about (unity through motivic repetition; Richard Wagner started it, if you must blame someone)  I must confess that the opening melody tricked me into thinking that Danny Elfman was behind the wheel... what with all the minor-ish intervals.  Not to say that Williams was copying Elfman here...  just that &quot;the mystery of minor mode&quot; is usually Elfman's bag.  However, being that mysticism is a major element in the movie, I find it's presence in the score apporopriate.  The &quot;heroic&quot; theme is all Williams, and it's appearance puts his stamp on the soundtrack.<br />Most of my musical brethren criticize Williams as a sort of re-distributor of Romantic program music, and not terribly original. You must understand, however, most film directors want an effect from film music, not artistic purity.  When a director approaches a composer with a recording of Mahler and says &quot;write something that sounds like this,&quot;  the composer usually and apporopriately obliges.  It's not always their fault. I'm fairly impartial myself, although I definitely like some of Williams' works more than others.  I think this is some of his best work in a while.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This is the rare instance where the director's post-release tinkering has improved what was already a fantastic film. Watching the &quot;Untitled&quot; cut (Director Cameron Crowe had such difficulty coming up with a title he almost released the film as &quot;Untitled&quot;) is like discovering long-lost chapters to your favorite book, or hearing outtakes from your favorite band. The additional scenes bring viewers further into both the hero's home life and the surreal life on the road of a touring rock band. The original cut of the movie is included in the set, but why anyone would want to see it after seeing this film in the longer form is beyond me.<br />And the extras ... simply the best on a DVD I've ever come across. The commentary with Crowe and his mother is at turns insightful, touching and hilarious. The part where they discuss whether Crowe lost his virginity the same way his alter ego on screen did is worth the price of admission alone. The deleted scenes include one that invites the viewer to cue up &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; since that was supposed to be the soundtrack for the scene, but the rights was unavailable. The satisfaction of seeing the characters on screen react to your dubbing is incredible. And there's a bonus CD of songs by &quot;Stillwater,&quot; the faux band in the film. The songs are a great pastiche of 70s rock that heighten the believability of the film. You really think you're listening to a great undiscovered band from the time.<br />As for the movie itself, the original film deservedly won an Oscar for best original screenplay and should have won more. Had more of Kate Hudson's performance as &quot;band aid&quot; Penny Lane been in the movie, she would have an Oscar today. Billy Crudup perfectly personifies both the innocence and the arrogance '70s rockers exuded, while Patrick Fugit's performance captures the uncool kid yearning to be cool we all were at that age. <br />Put simply, if you even just mildly enjoyed &quot;AlmostFamous,&quot; you owe it to yourself to give this a spin. It's everything about the movie you liked, raised to a higher level.
B00003CXXI|5.0|Shrek was wonderful!  Having not seen it at the theater, I rented it the week before Christmas as a trial for gift-giving for my young kids (3 and 5 yrs old).  They loved it and so did we!  Now we own it!  The music makes them (and us) want to crank up the surround sound system and get up and dance, and we all laugh hysterically throughout it...especially at Donkey's antics, Shrek's comments and tolerance of Donkey, and Fiona's singing.  While amusing and colorful to watch, it also supports the underlying message that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and that everyone has feelings to consider.  I definitely recommend this to anyone that wants to see, or even hear, a fun movie, or who wants to find themselves laughing repeatedly.  There are a few slight incidentals of adult humor the children may not catch on to, and some they will.  But it just adds to the attention captured from audiences of all ages.  A must see!
B000002L75|5.0|Much of Depeche Modes earlier material was more new-wave synth pop and more poppy in sound but this album is where they would become the dark depressing masters they are now. Some of the songs did stir up some controversy back when this album was released and this album was a major turning point for this amazing band.<br />Something to Do is a hard edged number that kicks this CD off. Lie To Me is an amazing song that I listen to many times without tiring. The dark melody, the sad sound to it is a treat for my ears. People Are People is a fabolous song with phat beats, killer bass lines and a sort of industrial feel. This song is about all people of all religions, races, etc. to get along regardless of their differences. This song has a great message. The ambience at the ending forever leaves this album in my memory. It doesn't matter doesn't have any major beats but has dingling synths and a both happy and sad sound to it. This song is great. Stories Of Old is another cool song but nto as great as the next one. This song is rather poppy. Somebody is a very sad piano ballad with simply pianos and Martin Gore on vocals. This song is truly a gem on this CD. Master And Servant stirred some controversy back during it's heyday. It's a hard-edged song with a strong industrial feel. This song from what I guess talks about S&amp;M. This is my second favorite. If You Want is my favorite off SGR. It starts off as a creepy electronic song with creepy keyboards and with no drums for the first minute. At 1:30 the drums starts and the song becomes an industrial new wave dance number. Blasphemous Rumours is the one that caused controversy back in 1984. It's a very depressing song about religous doubt and suicide. It's a very sad closer to this amazing album.<br />This CD marks the turning point for Depeche Mode and all of their latter music. While not as strong as their next 5 albums this is a very good album and should be in every DM fans collection.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore has composed a magical score.  Although most of the tracks are filled with harsh and sinister choral tones, the CD is worth buying for the tracks of warm and radiant music scattered between them.  The theme for the hobbits is a pure joy to listen to over and over again.  The music of Rivendell and Lothlorien is gorgeous and ethereal.  And - what a bonus! - you get two enchanting Enya songs in the deal.
B000053V0Q|4.0|One may not think much of a modern adaptation of a Shakespeare classic, but Baz Lurhmann's rendidition brings out a great deal of the passion, violence, lust, love and intrigue in Shakespeare's text that just is not present in most &quot;traditional&quot; versions (including the 1968 Ziffereldi version -- even though that is an excellent movie). This upated take on star-crossed teen lovers deserves a definate look.
B00003CXA6|4.0|Arguably, Gettysburg was the most crucial battle ever fought by Americans; for it determined, in the final analysis, whether the American system of government was to exist.  Having said that, however, it must be remembered that the battle was fought as a series of blunders and mistakes by the various commanders.  This movie makes clear the important results of these errors, and it strongly points out the &quot;fog of battle&quot; that surrounds any military action; a condition any commander would recognize.  As history, this movie is much closer to reality than to fiction, and is highly recommended.
6304666799|5.0|I entered the dance world pretty late, I was 15, three years ago. I saw Bournes' SWAN LAKE on video and it changed my life... I wanted to dance and thats all I wanted to do! Its very inspirational! I know that everyone would enjoy it! It gives you a different look at a timeless classic.<BR>In this version it shows how someone just needs to be loved, its not &quot;man and man&quot; its &quot;man and animal&quot;<BR>We see how even a royal family can have its problems! The queen (the mother) is so cold to her son the prince, but in each act she changes her characteristics, shes a great role to pay attention to. The prince has psychological problems but feels warmth when he finds his swan, later on when you come to the last act we see the swans as their wild nature, Mathew Bourne did this thing that (he meant for this) resembles the movie BIRDS. When that woman is not paying attention to the cage and all these birds keep building up in the cage, she finally turns and realizes that its too late for her now, the swan (cooper) and the prince (ambler) get into the same situation as the swans pile on to the bed and you can only guess what happens after that! It has similar vaslav nijinsky moves, like the conecting of the arms but not really touching. Very beutiful.<BR>This is a MUST see for all! not just fellow dancers, but for anyone who felt &quot;alone&quot; at any point of their life!<BR>Please support Mathew Bournes and his Adventures in Motion Pictures and purchase did masterpiece, its worthed!
B00005Q66T|5.0|Many Madonna fans have their gripes over this collection, due to the fact that it lacks new material, and the tracks are all edited over. Well, this collection really isn't made for them. This goes more for the casual fan or radio listener who doesn't have the albums and soundtracks that features these tracks. I consider myself a casual Madonna fan, loving many of her songs, but not really willing to go and buy alot of her previously released albums. This is personally, a perfect option for me, as it features two of my fave tracks, &quot;Deeper &amp; Deeper&quot; and &quot;Human Nature&quot;, though edited, they still make it worth it. I also enjoy &quot;Secret&quot; and &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;. The latter half from her more recent albums, has a very spiritual vibe and are also excellent. As I said, a great collection for a casual fan.
1556154844|5.0|Great book and gives psychological input to programmer's life. Made life easy to live in front of computer coding for ever.
B00005QDW5|4.0|There could have been a few more inclusions --  Have a Cigar, Brain Damage, The Final Cut but the songs here are a nice overview of the history of the band from Syd Barrett up to the latest lineup.    Overall its a good listen...I still may have to keep Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall.
B000002H1T|5.0|This album was a well crafted record for The Cars; courtesy of Ric Ocasek's song writing and mega-hit producer whiz - Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange! You Might Think, Magic, Hello Again, Why Can't I Have You and the title track were &quot;totally&quot; popular in the &quot;Big Hair&quot; era....but nothing can touch the 1 track on this album that really sets the standard for the quintesential pop song....Drive. This is the best pop song ever recorded....the slick production of Lange is evident on this one-of-a-kind gem. Benjamin Orr has the lead vocals on this one and doesn't disappont with his effort. The silky textured keyboard playing &quot;drives&quot; the song as the band's vocals harmonize richly in the background. What a song! So, that's 6 reasons to buy this hit album, from 1984....it's definitely The Cars best album! Buy it here at Amazon.com. Peace!
B00005JKMO|5.0|Watching Fresh Prince &amp; DJ Jazzy Jeff's &quot;Parents Don't Understand&quot; video,you'd never think that that skinny kid named Will Smith<BR>would play Muhammed Ali a millinuiem later.<BR>  Well,he does,but he does  a damn good job at it.<BR>&quot;Ali&quot;-directed by Micheal Mannn-is simply the best film of the year.Never has a biopic touches you more than the actual story<BR>like &quot;Ali&quot;(Spike Lee's &quot;Malcolm X&quot; came close).Will Smith,an<BR>actor I don't usually take seriously,does such a good job protraying THe Champ,there was times I forgot that wasn't<BR>the real Ali I was watching on the movie screen.<BR>  Jada Pinkett-Smith,Nona Gaye,and Micheal Michelle all do an extrodinary job as one of Ali's wives and Jamie Foxx's role<BR>as Ali's trainer nearly brought tears to my eyes.What a powerful movie!<BR>  I will be very upset if the Oscars don't at least nomiate &quot;ALI&quot;<BR>as Best Picture.This film more than deserves it!
B000001FLA|5.0|Everyone else has addressed the marvellous instrumental aspect of this album, so I'm not even going to bother with that.  But here's my assessment of the rest - this album is full of cheese!<BR>Of course, with song titles like &quot;You Don't Remember, I'll Never Forget&quot; and &quot;Queen In Love&quot;, how could it not be?  You have to love it, though.  This much cheese cannot be ignored.<BR>Once you hear this album, you will not be able to take it out of your CD player for approximately 3.72 weeks.  Make sure you have a nearby supply of food and water before listening.  And don't worry; if your friends ask why you like it so much, you can always point to Yngwie's always superlative guitar work and the other excellent instrumentation, but you'll know the truth: it's the cheese.
B00005U2JM|5.0|I haven't yet seen the video but ordered it as soon as i saw it on amazon. I rate this 5 stars because marilyn Manson is a genius and any thng he makes is surly to be great. i can't wait to recieve my movie
B00005BCPC|1.0|This story was said by Jane Austen to be her favorite.  How distressed she would be to see it portrayed this way.  Jane's point was slandered as it tried to drive home a more modern, &quot;politically correct&quot; viewpoint.  The main characters, Fanny Price and her cousin, Edmund, are pious and &quot;good&quot;, this is stressed throughout the book as being virtuous.  In this version, the characters are seen as out of touch, and seem to conform before they reach their happy ending.  This defeats the purpose of the story, which is that virtue &quot;wins&quot;.  Also, the scene where Fanny finds Tom's drawings of his father forcing a slave woman to have oral sex, is highly distracting, disturbing and unnecessary.  It doesn't fit with the story, or support the story's moral theme.<BR>The 1983 BBC version with Sylvestra Le Touzel and Nicholas Farrell as Fanny and Edmund is much more in keeping with the original tone of Jane's story.  It's also more &quot;family friendly&quot;-You won't have to have your children leave the room to watch it as you do this version.
158234082X|5.0|I read this book while taking the train every day to Culinary School and the restaurant.  The other riders would hear me laugh out loud at the right on descriptions of those I worked with.  I could see just about everything that Chef Bourdain would speak of.  The managerie of semi-criminals working behind the line, the fanatical Chefs who command absolute loyalty from those in their charge, the idiosyncrasies and chemical experimentation to deal with the stress of putting out dish after dish, this is not fiction!!  The spit-shine and polished TV chefs look good on the screen, but when they are behind the line, the yelling, the profanity, many times in as many different languages as there are ingredients on a plate, they become as real as you fear.  It was nice to see someone who knew the life, the industry, and what we go through to feed the public.  I have had this book for quite a while now, and have reread it many times, I still laugh out loud.
B00003CXXP|5.0|The combined creative forces of Kubrick and Spielberg work in A.I. to tug the viewer in opposite directions, with an end result that is not unlike the buzz from a strong Irish Coffee.  And like said Irish Coffee, after seeing A.I., I walked out of the theater like a wide-awake drunk, my mind racing from the stimulation of Kubrick's dark, heady ideas, yet I was simultaniously reeling from the impact of Spielberg's deft manipulation of my emotions.<br />It is this constant tension, this tearing of cinematic conventions and deliberate stretch beyond any one genre that lies at the core of the viewer's love-it-or-hate-it response to this movie.  Another key factor is the way that A.I. forces the viewer to participate in the film.  I had to actively pay attention for a change!  For example, there was a scientific aside toward the end of the film that discussed quantum physics as applied to the nature of consciousness.  I simply could not BELIEVE that this had made it into a mainstream film without having to be watered down or over-explained for the masses.<br />Also, beyond the obvious fairy-tale metaphors in A.I., there were many more subtle metaphors and uses of allegory that, again, required me to think for myself.  What a concept.<br />About the acting: If there were any justice in Hollywood, Osment would already have a couple of Oscars on his shelf, but they'll never give a kid the nod, because those egotistical narcissists absolutely can't stand it that on his worst day, little Haley Joel can act circles around most of these scenery chewing el-ronners, and this movie is no exception.  Hey, you with the throbbing cheek muscles.  And you with the blank-stare-as-acting method.  Yeah, you know who I'm talkin' about.<br />But I digress.  Anyway, the moment Osment's &quot;David&quot; character is given the last code word to activate his love for his adoptive mother, I nearly gasped out loud at Osment's facial transformation.  Wow.  I also want to say that Jude Law was fantastic as Gigolo Joe.  He managed to portray sleazy and endearing at the same time, which is no mean feat.<br />As for the negative there was very little, but can we call for a moratorium on the Robin Williams shticky cameos?  I like ol' short-n-fuzzy as much as the next guy, but his fast-talking pseudo-impersonations are getting stale, and are far too recognizable to be dropped into a serious piece like A.I.  It was jarring to suddenly hear the Genie from &quot;Aladdin&quot; in full manic force, and in the SoCal vernacular, he &quot;harshed my buzz, big time.&quot;<br />Overall, I gave this film 5 out of 5 because, although there are some less than perfect moments, it is a fantastic film in every sense of the word, and it will leave the intelligent viewer with something to think about for years to come.
B000002U8G|5.0|I generally never buy an album that has only one good song on it or in this case a masterpiece, but for Meddle I made an exception.  Alright so here was Pink Floyd before Dark Side.  The sound on this album is very Floydish (even if you've never heard this album you can still tell it's Floyd).  It's a sort of corss between the stuff we'd hear later on and the psychadelic stuff they did previously.  <br />The album opens up with One of these days, a very heavy tune with the simple lyric :&quot;One of these days I'm going to dance with a king of Sweden&quot;.  The next song it simply beatiful: pillow of winds.  The music and lyrics of this song are enough to put you to sleep.  I have sort of mixed emotions about next three songs: Fearless, San Tropez and Seamus.  While Fearless is not really filler, it's still not great by any mean.  I think when you put a song like Fearless next to complete throw away tracks like San Tropez (no it doesn't sound at all like the Beatles) and Seamus, the track actually seems decent.<br />The final track and the centerpiece of this album: Echoes, is the reason for buying this album.  It's over twenty minutes of pure genious on the part of all four members.  Water's bass is aloud to groove more than ever before, Gilmour's guitar soars, the keyboards and drums, courtesy of Rick Wright and Nick Mason really gel well here.  Some argue that this is the greatest PF track ever.  One thing is sure, it is among the greatest songs ever recorded.  <br />I suggest you buy this album after owning Dark Side and Wish you were here.  Meddle catches the band at a crossroad in their carreer.  This is an extremely important album in PF's evolution, if it hadn't been for this one there wouldn't be a DSOTM.
0446608955|5.0|This book was given to me for my birthday, and I couldn't put it down. I finished it in 3 hours flat and during which I cried my eyes out at least 4 times. 'A walk to remember' is a romantic peice filled with emotion and captivates you from the 1st line to the last. When you read it you feel like you're right there with the characters. I recommend this to anyone, especially teens because it represents faith, true love and memory.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Welcome to Leonard Shelby's life- a world the viewer experiences as Leonard himself does, without memory of why things are happening.  It is a story told to us backward, for the wonderful and fiendish effect of reverse suspense, never knowing why the events of the movie are occurring.  Motives become muddy; the meanings of every character's actions, including Leonard's, change as the movie progresses.<br />Along the way one can find a psychological study in the slippery nature of memory and reality.<br />This is a first-rate movie and a devilish thriller, complete with a small cast of characters who may or may not be helping Leonard to survive and find his elusive John G to exact revenge for Leonard's wife's death.<br />Highly, highly recommended.  As much so as The Usual Suspects or Blood Simple.
6305144176|5.0|i think this is the best war movie ever because it combines humor (Robin Williams - a hillarious radio broadcster) and fighting. Umm, there really isnt much more to say, u have to see the movie for yourself.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|ESCAPE...it's fun, exciting and very sexy, but at the same time, it's very sincere and intimate with very honest expressions of life, love and everyday emotions; listen to it with an open heart, over and over again; get into Enrique's very unique talent that breaks away from all the rest!
6305499365|5.0|I would recomend this movie to anyone who likes to laugh.  It is a real life potral of a guy (Peter) working in a dead end job at a software company and hates every minute of it. but things that a turn that will have you on the floor.  This movie is THE funniest movie i have ever seen.  If you haven't seen it you have missed out.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|Like all his previous work (in any language) \\"ESCAPE\\" has its very own unique sound and each song is entirely different from the next; there's something in it for everyone.. Enrique proves his multi-talent once again by creating yet another individual Style!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|What can you say about this movie? THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!! Amazing, great! Everyone has to see this movie; the sound track is wondeful too. I love the movie and the music!!! I watch this DVD every day now, and listen to the music anywhere. It's just simply unbelievable. The songs are the best over all. Even though the director's other two times before this one, were not very good, this one, I believe, can get at least two Oscars. Just watch it! THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!! And do you that the music was Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's own voice? It's very very cool. THe acting was great, the background music, the story, and camera angel, lighting, special effect, and alot more! They are all the best. Better than TItanic, Matrix, and of couse Harry Potter(it's really bad), and all other movie. Beefore, when ask me what's my favorite movie, I used to day &quot;I don't have one.&quot; But now, I will say &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; ! And go one with how great it was. It's sooooo good. THe charecters choosing were great: Nicole Kindman for Satine. Ewan McGregot for Christian, and the duke, Zidler. GREAT. A super beautiful movie. About TRUTHM, FREEDOM, BEAUTY, and above all, LOVE!!! THE GREATEST THING YOU'LL EVER LEARN, IS JUST TO LOVE, AND BE LOVE IN RETURN. Fantastic love story! I even memorize the movie. I love it soooooo much. SEE IT!!! Gurentee GREAT!!!
0786867973|5.0|After having just spent this Christmas house and dog sitting for some friends, I noticed this absolutely brilliant book by Nigella Lawson in the kitchen. I then proceeded to spend the next couple of days reading it from cover to cover.<BR>I live in Barbados and having never seen her before or read anything else by her I found her writing refreshingly natural and fun. The recipes are simple and easy to follow and most things don't take much preparation which is always a bonus. <BR>I for one thoroughly enjoyed the book and intend to get my own copy....and for anyone who's interested I made the &quot;Cranberry upside down cake&quot; at Christmas and it was delicious!
B000002UA2|5.0|While many don't agree with me, I find that the two soundtrack albums \\"More\\" and this little beauty are two of Pink Floyd's finest. I constantly alternated between favorites out of this and \\"More,\\" but currently my conclusion is that this ranks number one. OBC just seems to have a mood to it that makes you want to go outside at night or something. The tracks are very memorable... <br />\\"Burning Bridges\\" is my favorite Pink Floyd track, and it features Richard Wright and Roger Waters doing vocals. Wright really does have a great voice, and despite how he feels about his talent, he really should acknowledge his greatness. The keyboard contribution Wright plays is also superb.<br />\\"Mudmen\\" is an instrumental that is reminiscent to \\"Burning Bridges.\\" This track will take you to other worlds.<br />\\"Stay\\" is written by Richard Wright, and sung by the man himself. He proves himself worthy as a Pink Floyd member with his contributions to OBC. Also has great Electric Guitar from Gilmour.<br />I reccomend Obscured by Clouds to those already familiar with slow-paced music. If you are looking for \\"Another Brick in the Wall,\\" look anywhere but here. If you are looking for another Dark Side of the Moon, that's another story. Obscured by Clouds forshadows most of what you hear in Dark Side, and in my opinion, has much more.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|this movie was awesome!!! i could watch it like, a billion times and never ever get sick of it! each scene was so cool, they were all a kaleidoscope of color and sound. the cinematography was breathtaking, and so were the performances of Ewan mcgregor and nicole kidman. everything was so fast paced, and when it was over my sister and i kept watching the &quot;elephant love medley&quot;, scene over and over just so we could fully appreciate it. &quot;I really hope this movie wins best movie at the oscars this year, because this is really one of the best movies i've ever seen. go buy it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! please!
B00000K2SC|5.0|I've seen the movie a hundred times, and it still wows me each time.
0385501560|5.0|I just read the other reviews of this book.  There's some high and low praises, so I decided to add my two cents.  I've read all Chuck's books, and his short stories in Playboy (which, as it turns out, were excerpts from Choke).  I have to say I think Chuck Palahniuk is one of the hottest writers out there today.  Choke is my current favorite by him, and is definitely worth the read.  I'm not the only one who thinks so.  My brother and his friends NEVER read, but I read them bits and pieces, and they have since all read Choke, and want to read his others.  Buy this book.
014034294X|5.0|Matilda Wormwood is an extraordinary child genius. She taught herself to read and speak before she was four-years-old--all without the help of her lazy, ignorant parents or older brother, Michael--and goes on to develop telekinetic abilities. Her teacher, Miss Jennifer Honey, is impressed with Matilda's accomplishments, and with further tutoring, she helps the young girl master her spectacular gift. This gift later becomes useful when Matilda decides to save Crunchem Hall Primary School from the sadistic Headmistress, Miss Agatha Trunchbull, and free her favorite teacher (Miss Honey) from poverty.<br />Like all of Roald Dahl's books, this was a breeze and delight to read, filled with lots of mature humor and fun games. The book was made into a movie in 1996, and although I never saw it, I'd encourage anyone who plans to watch it to read the book first. Generally, Dahl's books outshine the movie version. Highly recommended for 8 to 12+ year-olds.
B00005JKMO|3.0|&quot;Ali&quot; - the current theatrical release which features Will Smith in the title role, is convincing enough in some spots to grab the viewer's interest, while in other areas, leaves a bit to be desired, as far as the film's realistic merits are concerned. Yes, the latter match with Ali vs. Foreman displays a lot of that ol' in your face, grit and determination these two put into every punch thrown. The first match vs. Sonny Liston lacks that very fire, heart and gusto present in the George Foreman bout. Due to the fact the Ali-Liston fight featured in the film is simulated, doesn't win any popularity contests with many who view(ed) this feature (myself included). Nevertheless, it was an effect that had to be included to heighten the realism of the movie. The Foreman bout, although simulated to a degree as well, looked as if Will Smith and the other actor had to train to withstand those punches. This particular fight comes across well on the big screen, and is dramatic, no doubt. Now, on to Muhammad Ali's life, as portrayed by Smith in the film. Overall, Smith does a good job in capturing the essence of Ali's character, in that he hardly misses a step in quantifying a trait the real Ali was famous for - that being his arrogance and confidence inside (as well as outside) the boxing ring. As far as Ali's religious affiliation (as noted in the film) is concerned, it is surprising to note that Ali was expelled from the Muslim religion, for reasons poorly conveyed in the film. Therefore, the viewer is not given any explanation as for the cause of Muhammad Ali's expulsion from Islam. Ali is later reinstated in the Muslim religion, for reasons unknown according to the film. The character of Howard Cosell, as portrayed by Jon Voight, lacks two main characteristics - one, Voight fails to capture the physical essence of Cosell in both profile and voice, the latter of which is only 50 to 75% accurate. Two, Cosell's putdowns of Ali come across as raw and somewhat uninspiring here. It is also surprising that Ali and Cosell became good friends off camera (were they really?), and not so surprising these two were adversaries on the proverbial TV screen. Again, it is quite possible that Hollywood used the friendship scenario to draw the viewer into the movie. As far as this picture being fact-based is concerned, there is a rather distinct possibility that it may very well be, but I, for one, am not quite sold on that premise. So, in order to weigh the pros and cons of &quot;Ali&quot;, you'll just have to see it and decide for yourself.ing here.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|What a mesmerizing film! The whole backwards technique works, actually, and to great length. The acting is superb. The direction/cinematography is spectaular. The soundtrack/score is also amazing in a subdued, quiet way.<br />The DVD itself is also pretty nice. It's just a good time looking at the menus. And you do have other things, including a short story, trailers, TV Spots, an interview with the director, etc, etc.<br />What's missing is a director's commentary. Where the heck is that? It's needed for this kind of film. They could of turned a pretty nice DVD into a must-have-for-everyone kind of DVD.<br />It really doesn't matter. The film is the main concern for this DVD, and, as everyone knows, it simply works in it's own way. A mammoth of a film, &quot;Memento&quot; deserves some recognition when the award season comes around.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I love Pinks last album, and even though her hair is no longer pink and short, her attitude is all the same. I gotta say, this is a CD you MUST get! It's got a little different feel from her last CD, but it's a good feel. My favorite song was Dont let me get me. I LOVE it! I would give this CD a 4 1/2 cause it did have some songs that were not as good as the others. But...everyone has their own opinion, so I suggest you listen to some of the sound clip thingys. So there u go, good luck!
B00005QDW5|4.0|Being a new fan of Pink Floyd, I'd say this &quot;Best Of:&quot; collection is actually quite good. The people behind this spent time on transitions betweens songs and such, and everything melds together quite nicely.<br />Just listen to the transition between &quot;Us and Them&quot; and &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; -- it's amazing.<br />The music is the most important thing on here though, and you get it in spades. Granted, there's some songs such as &quot;Young Lust&quot; and &quot;Brain Damage&quot; (and many others) that didn't get treatment, but otherwise, you'll find a very, very solid collection of music on here. Even the packaging is nice.<br />This is probably best for new Pink Floyd fans, or anyone interested in Pink Floyd. You'll find a lot more when you start buying their albums.
B00003CY5J|2.0|I saw a preview of The Score, when it came out in Theatres.  I was impressed by two things.  1)Robert De Niro. 2)Edward Norton.  That's it.  You shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, nor a film, entirly by the preview.  However with the actors billed, I figured it was worth a look.  And it is.<br />The best way I can describe this movie without giving away any hints is this: Picture a joke, with a punch line that takes only a sentence.  A one liner.  Now take that &quot;one liner&quot; and try to film it, using about 90 minutes.  That is what the score does. <br />Why do we root for the bad guy?  Do we root for the Bad guy because he's Robert De Niro, or Mel Gibson?  In this movie, I rooted for the bad guy, like were suppost to.  But why?  Why do we care if they are caught?<br />This movie doesn't make any sense because it doesn't surround any elements we really care about.  De Niro and Norton are great, and Angela Basset looks like she's only here because she's on contract.<br />I would definetly watch it for yourself.  It's entertaining, and suspenceful.  The only thing: There is no reasoning behind it.
B00003CXXS|3.0|THE STORY: Sam Neill reprises his part as Dr. Alan Grant from JP. Thios time, millionaire Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) and his wife (Téa Leoni) ask him to guide an adventure trip in a plane over Isla Sorna, where INGEN engineered the dinosaurs. But the Kirbies are planing on landing the plane on the island in order to find their son, who was last seen paraglyding over Isla Sorna. Now, they're hunted by the islands inhabitants as they conduct their search..<br />THE CAST: Somehow I couldn't shake off the feeling that they all did it for the money. The actors seem bored and their efforts to give some depth to their characters fails miserably. William H. Macy did never act that bad since Air Force One and Téa Leoni.. well, she actualy only screams and plays the helpless woman.<br />THE SCRIPT/DIRECTION: THhe story isn't really existing but after The lost World, I wasn't really expecting a lot. While the first Jurassic Park had an interesting story to tell, the sequels just consit of humans running away from dinosaurs. But they are great. In Jurassic Park II the star is the Spinosaur and in its most exciting scene, he kills of the king... the T-Rex. The blending between live action dinosaurs and CG-creatures is seemless and amazing. The most suspensful scene involves Pteradons, flying dinosaurs. It is the only sequwence that builds up tension. The rest of the movie is to rushed to accomplish that and Joe Johnston tends to cut away from beautiful shots too fast so you can't quite marvel at the images. <br />ALL IN ALL Jurassic Park III is entertainig but hollow, it is fun but over before it starts. It's the typical sequel cash-in movie, that is unnecessary but not useless.
B00005ATQD|1.0|Tom Cruise is his absolute worst in this flic.  Dont waste your money.  This has to be among the poorest excuse for acting that I have ever seen.  Even at $1.99 for the 4 nite rental, it was a waste.
031286504X|5.0|This is just a great example of a pacy, exciting and thoughtful novel.  The book begins by introducing us to Robert Neville, the last man alive on earth after the rest of the population have been killed or turned into vampires by a strange disease.  By night he barricades himself in his house and plays opera and gets drunk, by day he makes stakes and goes about hunting the vampires who were once his friends and neighbours...<br />The book is so good at giving you that feel of deserted cities and landscapes and as a result, a strong sense of loneliness that Robert Neville feels. He drives through once busy streets that now stand deserted and quiet.  His vampire neighbours taunt him and scream all night keeping him awake in his boarded-up house and making him go slowly crazy.  No-one makes products anymore or works in a store, money is meaningless, no fashion, no weather forecasts, no telephones and the only power from a petrol run generator.<br />How long can he survive in this world on his own and will he want to?  How can he stay untouched by the acts of killing his friends and neighbours during the day?  How long will the petrol and food last for?  and what if they break into his house one night or he gets tired and careless?<br />You find yourself constantly questioning how he lives, right up until the final page and the upside down revelation that makes you go, 'huh?'<br />Oh and you get to see where Stephen King got all his best ideas from, too.
B00005ARDC|5.0|Yeah you could say that JAMC was here before but the focus is something to behold. Just enough the chain's icy vaneer is shaved off to make it immediate. Then take what's left and apply a dash of the Doves' &quot;wild in the record shop&quot; vibe to make an album that is set in its ways but not blind to the possibilties of rock. Admittedly I was hesitant to give this a shot but damn. The trio swipes noise rock back from the Brits and creates something that brings all that is good about noise pop back. So if you miss that Bo Diddley beat and the jet engine feedback coupled with non cliched 60's flavored pop, this is the real deal. You want a highlights list then I have to say everything up to the final track Salvation which just doesn't have that oomph to put it over. An awesome debut that bids well for their future and show there is just an enough tricks that this type of rock can do to make it worthwhile.
080017948X|5.0|While most viewers try to catch the number of times the scenes repeat themselves, this modern (within the last ten years) movie contains one of the classic scenes that can actually enrich ones life.<br />In &quot;Groundhog Day,&quot; weatherman Phil Conners, played by actor bill Murry, is locked in a time warp in which he seems destined to relive Groundhog Day, February 2nd, over and over again.  The classic scene occurs after midnight, but before the bewitching hour of 6:00 A.M. when the day begins repeating itself, on a day when Phil has succeeded in convincing Rita, his producer, played by Annie MacDowell, that he is truly reliving this one day, again and again.  As they lay platonically in bed, with Rita falling asleep, he begins to tell her what he should have told her the first time that he saw her, instead of being so self-absorbed that he couldn't see what she really was like (&quot;I think what I wanted to say was I think you are the kindest, sweetest, prettiest person I've ever met in my life.  The first time I saw you, something happened to me that I never told you, but I wanted to hold you as hard as I could.  I don't deserve someone like you, but if I ever could, I'm sure I would love you for the rest of my life&quot;).<br />He awakes the next morning, without Rita by his side, but with a a new persona.  Perhaps this change is because he was spurred on by Rita who told him the evening before, &quot;Maybe it's not a curse (referring to his reliving this day over and over), it's just how you look at it.&quot;  Suddenly, forgotten are the days when Phil used his endless life to temp fate by living his life through the seven deadly sins, as he finds the joy of living each day to its fullest, learning to expand his purpose in life through helping others.  Finally, he lives a Groundhog Day in which he becomes something of a local hero to many in the community, and Rita, realizing his inner beauty, buys his services at the bachelor charity auction.  That night, they platonically fall asleep with the true realization of each other's stellar inner qualities, and instead of waking-up on February 2nd, again, it's February 3rd.  Together they begin to plan a life together with the realization that there is something more after today.<br />Phil's final characterization of life can be depicted in the words he uses to describe the Groundhog Festival near the end of the movie.  &quot;When Checkov saw the long winter, he saw a winter bleak and dark and beraf of hope, but we know that winter is just another step in the cycle of life.  But, standinghere among the people of Punxsutawney, and basking here in the warmth of their hearts, I couldn't imagine a better fate than a long and lustrous winter.&quot;
B00004XQ83|5.0|When I saw this movie, which I loved, I had to have the soundtrack.  The music is magnificent although &quot;Constant Sorrow&quot; is repeated twice more.  I suppose that is because the music follows the sequence of the movie exactly.  When I discovered this movie was made by the Coen brothers, I knew it would be &quot;different,&quot; and I was extremely pleased and surprised by the music.
B00000J7S8|3.0|I bought Ms Krall's first CD in 1993, and she quickly was established as one of my favourite artists; I've recommended her albums to others, seen her in concert several times, and even met her once (briefly). I really like her as an artist and a person. That makes it all the more disappointing for me as a longtime fan to see the direction her career has taken since the marketing folks at GRP got ahold of her. Her first three CD's were characterized by a strong, natural singing style, and solid improvisiation and interplay between instrumentalists. -She used to swing! Her fourth disc, Love Scenes, introduced a new marketing approach, capitalizing on Ms. Krall's beauty to catch the attention of a wider audience. This was accompanied by a new singing style: more breathy, sultry, &quot;pop&quot;. Instrumentally, the &quot;swing&quot; was gone, the solos now truncated.<BR>   This CD goes even further, nearly devoid of the joy, energy, and life that previously characterized Ms. Krall's work. One may apply Duke Ellington's famed Jazz litmus test: &quot;it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing&quot;; this disc doesn't! Regarding other reviews, it should be noted that some of the Jazz critics who have been negative about this release are not people with a prejudice against her; they're the same ones who championed Diana Krall earlier in her career, when she was still making jazz records. <BR>The sad conclusion for those of us who love Diana Krall: there's more jazz in her current &quot;Christmas is Comin' Again&quot; jingle for Target stores, than in her last 3 CD's combined!
B000002UE9|5.0|In the era of &quot;Big Hair Bands,&quot; Poison definately had its fair share of fans.  Following up their awesome debut album, they tore the house down with OPEN UP AND SAY...AHH!<br />Brett Michaels and crew put together an awesome album that was the epitomy of the Heavy Metal craze of the late 80s.  Probably their most popular song, and still one of the greatest ballads ever written, &quot;Every Rose Has It's Thorn&quot; is a beautiful song with a wonderful sound.  Other standout songs include the ever-catchy &quot;Nothin' But A Good Time,&quot; the fun, finger-snapping &quot;Your Mama Don't Dance,&quot; and the well-written &quot;Fallen Angel.&quot;<br />Overall, this is one outstanding album with a nice mix of sounds and tempos.  Most of the songs on this album include well-written lyrics that you must take for what they are worth.  This is an album of non-stop fun that is sure not to  disappoint.
0385505833|5.0|This book is blad crud from an author who makes basic stories and djue to some trick of anture sells his stuff to movie houses.<br />They are all bland and this is no different.  He wrote about a law firm that kills lawyers to make more money woo-de-doo<br />There is nothing intellectual abouth this book.  The only thing I can relate it to is some kind of political statemetn that america is a christian run tyrrany of some sort and christmas exemplifies this and other religons are mad because the couuntry shuts down to celebrate.  I reccomend get more presents than even adn leave this boring author by the wayside.  I wish they had negative stars. -5 stars!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|All I can say is Wow!  While I have to admit, Moulin Rouge is NOT a movie everyone would enjoy, I was totally blown away.  The costumes, the camerawork, the sets, the musical numbers.  I think this is the most original movie to hit the theaters in 25 years.  Ewan McGregor is stunning as the writer, Nicole Kidman has never been better, all the supporting cast is top-notch.  I could go on and on, but if you love a good romance and great music, do NOT miss this one!
B00000BKDW|5.0|iron maiden`s powerslave is the greatest heavy metal album ever recorded,plain and simple.from dual guitar harmonies that rival anything done by thin lizzy or status quo,to singing of such a level,that you would swear Bruce Dickinson was a opera singer in another life,this album is perfect.with songs about the battle of britain,egyptian mythology,the prisoner tv show,and the rime of the ancient mariner,only Rush  can rival thier intelligence when it comes to writing songs.Steve Harris is the best bass player and song writer in heavy metal bar none.
0684843749|5.0|I've been bodybuilding for almost 2 and a half years and this book always keeps me motivated and educated.  Arnold really did a good job with this book, although the nutrition section is a little outdated.  This book has cool pictures and even a Hall of Fame section.  It's an all-around good book, from beginning to advanced.
B00003CXTG|2.0|A pleasant enough love story shot on the location of the actual battle, the movie unfortunately suffers from gross historical inaccuracy, video game-like special effects, and dialogue which is not believable.  I was greatly disappointed, given all of the prerelease hype, and all of the on-location shooting, which was essentially wasted.
6304698623|5.0|I watched 'A Little Princess' more than 4 times and in each time I enjoy the movie more and more!  A remarkable story, and a great work by the stars of the movie.  Don't miss the nice moments watching this movie with your family members!
B00003CXXI|3.0|Okay, so we all loved the on-screen characters and the off-screen celebrities. But after weeks of hearing how this was &quot;the thing&quot; to watch, I was disappointed in the weak overall plot layout: we have no background about the area or kingdom in which the characters live, we have little explanation for the fairy-tale character roundup, and why is the prince obsessed with marriage if he is already royalty?
B00005JKT8|4.0|It was a choice among several newly-released movies for our annual Christmas night outing--&quot;Ali&quot;, &quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;--but we were quite pleased with our decision to see &quot;Kate and Leopold&quot;.<br />Forget what a lot of the pro critics have to say (in fact, it was a largely negative review by a well-known local critic that motivated us to go in the first place!)--because whether or not everything fits together, gets resolved, or is based in logic really doesn't matter.  Not only is the movie a delightful romantic comedy, but it's about doing the right thing, redemption, and seeing people for what they are--all important in a year that's been rather rough for most of us lately.  Yes, you've seen a lot of it before--but so what?  I'd love to see some  of &quot;Splash&quot;, &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;, and &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; in every movie for which I fork out seven bucks.<br />Getting off the subject for a second, I do wish writers of time-travel movies would start checking out the most basic of facts.  &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; comes to mind, where Chris Reeve romances Jane Seymour with music that was not written until 25 years later--or &quot;Fields of Dreams&quot;, where the great left-handed batter Joe Jackson hits right-handed throughout.  Here, Leopold is transported into the present from 1876, but is an expert on &quot;La Boheme&quot;.  I'll leave that one for you to figure out...:&gt;)<br />It's a good movie.  See it!
B00003CX5P|5.0|Dont you hate it when DVD reviewers spend 10 paragraphs describing how cool a movie was instead of reviewing the DVD itself?  Dont worry, I wont do that.  The movie was good.  Onto the DVD now.<BR>This being the first Star Wars DVD, you would think that a lot of features would show up.  Well, dont worry about that.  There are enough features here to keep your attention for days.  First onto the audio and the video quality.  <BR>The Video quality for the movie is outstanding, with crystel clear, sharp quality that really enhances it.  The Audio is also excellent, especially the excellent musical score and all the sound effects that have been remastered.  <BR>The Features is a good enough reason alone to own this disk.  If you want behind the scenes features, documentarys and deleated scenes, you got e'm.  The first thing people are going to look at, is of course, the Deleted scenes, involving a Waterfall sequence, extended Podrace clips and more.  They are very interesting to look at and very satisfying.  The Documentarys are also very cool, including a hour long documentary that shows Jar Jar tests, The sets being built and my personal favorite, the feature that shows early annimation tests for the podrace and sub sequences, be sure to look at the early versions that are increadebly funny and laugh out loud hilarious to look at.  Just wait untill you see what a early version of Sebulba looks like!<BR>But theres more, if you are truly determened you might find the elusive(and very funny) Bloopers and outtakes, Hint: Watch every feature from beginning to end. <BR>Overall, this is a very cool DVD that is definiatly worth picking up.  Dont miss it.<br />The Good:<BR>Its a Star Wars DVD!  Loads of features<br />The bad: Nothing<br />And the ugly: Nothing
B00005176F|4.0|...and here's the proof:<br />Actually not a 'box set' like Amazon bravely suggests, but a double CD set with the 2nd disc being a live recording, this is a rather fine and nearly complete collection nonetheless.  <br />Although at least a couple of sizeable U.K. hits (and pretty good songs) -- &quot;Chemical World&quot; &amp; &quot;Stereotypes&quot; -- are omitted from here, you still get 16 great or near great tracks on just disc one (Let's face it, hits or not, inexplicably big hit &quot;Country House&quot; and newbie &quot;Music is My Radar&quot; are both rather rubbish).<br />But this is even more diverse than Blur are usually given credit for: white-boy-art-school-drop-out-gospel in &quot;Tender&quot;, punk in &quot;Song 2&quot;, disco in &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot;, pop in &quot;Coffee &amp; TV&quot; and Madness-meets-Kinks in &quot;Parklife&quot;.  Oasis what?  <br />That said, though, you'd also need at least the &quot;Parklife&quot; album aside from this, to make the Blur section of your CD collection representable; Blur themselves may pretend to be coy and even embarrased about their mid-'90s 'Brit Pop' heyday, but there is (or at least was) more to this band than &quot;Song 2&quot; or their uneven recent forays into the hit &amp; miss world of lo-fi.  And just don't get me started on the Gorillaz -- guilt by mere association proves nothing.<br />But besides all that, you really can't go wrong with this one.
0141301104|4.0|Surely the best of Roald Dahl's works.  'The Witches' is just delightful, chock-full of wit and wonder.  Dahl manages to create a society of witches (focusing on those in England) that are so horrible you just can't help but wonder about every fiber of their magic.  From The Grand High Witch of All the World to the unnamed Boy and his kind elderly Grandmamma, every character is integrated with life.  A real children's book, and one for any age.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Whats with all this snivelling and crying about the sound quality of &quot;1&quot;? Gimmie a break,will ya? The musics great,the sounds is great... LET IT BE!!!
0380789019|5.0|When I picked up my first Gaiman masterpiece at a local bookstore, a worker there asked me if I was a fan.  All I could say was, &quot;I'm not sure.&quot;  After this book, undoubtedly.  'Neverwhere' is a work of beauty, pure magic.  If you're not a fan of 'The Sandman' series, here's a good place to start.  No matter what great things you've heard, or in spite of foul, you will need to experience this book for yourself.  Gaiman has woven a world unmatched by any other in the fantasy genre, cold, hard, wonderous, and not for the faint of heart.  There are no real heros, no real villians.  London Underground just doesn't work that way.  Read it, you'll know what I mean.
0071373586|5.0|I read this book as a precursor to my MBA Marketing course back in 1986. It's more applicable today with the growing marketing clutter &amp; it certainly makes you think about marketing. Highly recommended and easy to read - the small paperback can be finished within a week-end and well worth it.
0060194995|5.0|I first read this book for an English class in high school and hated it. Luckily, I recently bought this hardcover edition and read it again. It's now one of my favorites. I'm sure there's plenty of other reviews that deal with the plot, but I'd like to emphasize the brilliant characters in this book.<br />Atticus Finch has easily become one of my most favorite literary characters. Lee's brilliance with Finch is that while as the plot unfold you see what a truly great man he is, she shows her audience his flaws as well. This makes him a very complete and rounded character. Scout's also great - she's wise beyond her years, which makes reading a book that centers around such a young character enjoyable. Besides these two great characters, it also is a wonderful book.
B00003CXXP|4.0|What I liked specifically about this movie was the fact that it brought into question what rights we as humans should have over Artificial Intelligence once we've created it.  Once it has been activated, it is now a thinking, decision-making thing not really so different from ourselves.  Our own brains, after all, are just organic computers of a sort - organic intelligence.  Add in actual emotions (fear, love, etc.) and now how are these Mecha so different from ourselves?<br />Once created, are these A.I. Mecha still toys that we can enslave, torture, humiliate, and use them to realize our own fantasies?  Do we have the right to abandon or scrap them when we find them no longer useful or amusing?<br />A.I. does a good job of making you ask yourself these questions.  In the end if you don't ask yourself &quot;if it looks human, thinks like a human, and has emotions like a human does it really matter if it has been manufactured?&quot; I would be surprised.<br />Overall the film's special effects were amazing, the plotline acceptable and the ending somewhat disconcerting.  I think it's the questions that you walk away asking yourself that matter in regards to this flick.
0385505833|1.0|I hate to do this, because I'm a huge Grisham fan, but this book is a bore. The only reason I finished it is because it was short, and I was trying to kill time on a flight. This wasn't because it's not a &quot;classic&quot; Grisham tale - I enjoyed &quot;A Painted House&quot; - but rather it just seemed uninspired.<br />You never feel a connection with the two main characters, Luther and Nora, so when the story starts what I suppose is intended to be its climax, you just don't care. After finishing this book, I felt like I had just watched a bad sitcom Christmas special. I'm a huge Grisham fan, and would have given a mediocre book my full support, but this was just dull. Oh well, we're all human, and this is definitely the exception to an otherwise great collection of work.
B00005ATQI|4.0|Okay, there has been much debate over this film because of how it doesn't exactly ring true to Stephen King's book. I think it's just as good either way. King should be happy. This is one of the better film adaptions of his books(the other good ones being \\"Stand By Me\\" and \\"Misery\\"). Jack Nicholson stars as family man Jack Torrance. He gets a job as a caretaker for a large hotel that's closed for winter. He brings his wife and young son along with. The eerie hotel is filled with possessive spirits. Little by little, day by day, Jack begins to go mad as the spirits start to take him over and turn him into a crazy, murderous psychopath, who turns on his family. Sound scary?. It is. There's nothing scarier than when something evil is after you and there is no escape. You can run, but you can't hide. The actors are over the top brilliant. Nicholson. What can I say?. He is one of the greatest legends we have. This is one dandy of a teriffic, classic performance. Nobody else could have done this role. NOBODY. He is creepy and mad, and will get under your skin. There are a few classic(and often hilarious)lines and scenes here. Nicholson delivers them in a pitch perfect portrayal of a normal guy driven to insanity. Shelley Duvall, as his victimized wife, is very effective as well. Director Stanley Kubrick really filmed this classic very well. Establishing the hotel and it's creepy inside was filmed just right. It's long, empty, silent corridors and rooms. Oh lord. It's scary just thinking about it. Some people have problems with the movie. That is too bad. Some others think Nicholson's performance was pure ham and was really overacting. Some times, people, what seems like ham and overacting is what's best. It's acting. Some people don't understand that. All in all, this is a good, well made movie. A classic!.
B000002A46|4.0|Even if you are not a fan of Miss Carey's non-holiday recordings, there is much to appreciate on this set.<br />Mariah's composition &quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You&quot; is one of the best modern holiday recordings.  Her remake of the Phil Spector- produced, Darlene Love sung classic &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot; as well as a &quot;Joy To The World&quot; that combines the Christmas hymn with the Three Dog Night hit are almost as good.  These boisterous numbers are countered by some first-rate renditions of the poignant &quot;Silent Night,&quot; &quot;O Holy Night&quot; and her own &quot;Jesus What A Wonderful Child.&quot;  <br />The histrionics that mar a lot of Mariah's work are at a minimum on this Christmas set.  Buy it today and get a head start on Christmas 2002 (it's less than a year away!)
B00004Y7SF|1.0|I will be the first to say that Christina Aguilera has a gift.  Her voice is quite powerful and very versatile.  However, this album is a blatant example of how she can take a standard song and transform it into something that leaves me unable to comprehend the words.  I have always thought that the biggest reason that Christina sings, is to hear herself.  This album does not invite nor invoke any spirit of Christmas or the frame of mind that is associated with it.  It is basically a 'look what I can do that you can't' album that fails in every aspect.  Whitney Houston is known to do the same kind of thing during her performances, but her albums tone that down enough for the listener to enjoy and revel in her mastery.  This album makes no attempt to do that.  It is an album that Christina made for Christina, and not one that is meant to be 'shared' as Christmas albums with standards should.
B00003OSTQ|5.0|Wow! A movie with intelligent, original ideas and dialogue; fantastic acting by Finch and Holden, and a wid satire to boot. Peter Finch gives one of the greatest performances in film history as the newsman going through a psychotic breakdown. He gets the mad messiah character down perfectly - it is lunacy with enough truth in his message to make the rest of the film work around his hyper-energetic center. Great moviemaking!
0553213105|5.0|It's been awhile since I've read any literature involving flowery language and staunch manners but I'm so glad I came back to it!!! Pride and Prejudice is extremely well-written and the characterization is fabulous. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy create delicious sparks with their constant head-butting and romantic tension. Elizabeth can probably best be described as someone who embodies the best manners, heart, and intentions without being sappy or spineless; she is incredibly intelligent and strong-willed. It's interesting to read this book and think of how women of the time had to play the love &quot;game&quot; and marry above their station to progress in society. It also sheds light on Jane Austen's own independent state of mind that her most darling character was a total fireball! This book will give you constant butterflies and provides a nice glimpse into the comedy and pettiness of the society of the time, all the while, weaving a charming tale not soon to be forgotten.
B00005R2IS|5.0|Finally! The original version of &quot;Mad Max&quot;! I had been waiting for this since I first saw &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; in the theatres so long ago.<BR>While the film is still the same, the atmosphere is far different because since the voice aren't as over the top as the dubbed version. The nomad bikers are far more menacing, &quot;the Goose&quot; is more charasmatic and Mel himself more believable. Unfortunately nothing can save that painful &quot;brown shoes&quot; scene, but, hey, that's what the &quot;fast forward&quot; is for.<BR>If I had any problem with this version at all it would be that, since they moved it to 5:1 sound, sometimes the voices get lost in the background over music swells. It's one thing when dialog is drowned out by a roaring motor (that happens in real life), but when the actors are lost to an orchestral punch, it can be annoying.<BR>If you are going to get &quot;Mad Max&quot;, this is the version to get. While the US dub is the one we're most familiar with, it also loses something that has finally been re-installed for the States.
0446608955|5.0|When I read this book I was a little skeptical.Then after I was reading the book for about a couple chapters I realized I couldn't put the book down.After I was finished with the book I cried because the story was so heart-felt and sad that's all u can do is cry.
B00004XQP4|4.0|The latest offering (bar `International Superhits') from the prestigious punk band is distinctly different to their previous albums.  Although it's a lot more geared towards pop than punk, something which is sure to make a few hardcore fans abandon them, their lyrics are still as quirky, individual and fantastic as on `Dooky'.  By going for more catchy songs and instruments that now include harmonica and stomping feet the album flows well and will appeal to a whole new audience base.  More importantly, they haven't left their old style entirely behind as some people have suggested.  This is a new course obviously, but all the best bands have to, indeed should, vary their music to keep themselves alive in an increasingly competitive chart-orientated world.<br />Certainly, their lyrics are a great deal more insightful and interesting than Blink 182, the other popular punk band.  Songs such as `Warning' and `Church On Sunday' are both catchy and intelligent, something of a rarity among the irksome nu-metal and `punk' bands that have surfaced recently to just as much hype as the successful pop bands out there.  The real gem on the album though is `Misery', which darkly humorous and intriguing.<br />Obviously this is no perfect album, but it's definitely one of the better punk albums to have surfaced in the last few years.
B00004XPP0|5.0|Two hours in a darkened movie theater in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1977 were enough to change the life of a then eight-year-old kid forever.  For anyone out there who enjoys adventure, science fiction, special effects, or just good storytelling, there is no denying that the original Star Wars trilogy is a monumental achievement in modern American cinema.  The cultural influence of these movies cannot be overstated enough.  The first film and its two sequels have grabbed a place in American culture right up there next to Gone With The Wind.  99% of movies out in the last few decades will eventually fade and be forgotten, but these films will be around forever.  I myself now have two young kids, and you can bet that I will sit down and watch these movies with them many times.<br />These three films, together with their three &quot;prequels&quot;, tell a basic, simple story.  It's the story of the corruption of good from within, the seeming hopeless descent into evil, and the eventual redemption and victory of good.  Once you get past all the special effects and sci-fi elements, it's actually a very powerful theme, an one I think everyone can benefit from.  The message is wrapped up in a LOT of good storytelling, including awesome space battles, unforgettable characters, and more than a little comedy.  <br />As far as the new effects and added scenes for the Special Edition versions, I thought they were kind of a mixed bag.  In the first film, for example, I really liked the shots of the Millenium Falcon on approach to Yavin, and I also liked the shots of the X-Wings and Y-Wings as they round the curve of the red gas giant on their way to do battle for the Death Star.  There were several EXCELLENT new shots on Tatooine, especially Obi-Wan Kenobi's house and the &quot;new&quot; version of Mos Eisley.  On the other hand, I could have done without some of the changes to the dogfighting scenes, and also I think the movie was better off without the scene between Han and Jabba.  I also never quite understood why they added in one scene with Biggs at the rebel base, but not the scenes between Luke and Biggs on Tatooine.  As it stands, the addition of Biggs is jarring and doesn't seem to make any sense.  It makes sense if you've read the original book, but one shouldn't have to read the book to understand the movie.  I also thought the change to the scene with Han and Greedo was a mistake.  As for Empire and Jedi, those changes didn't make much difference to me.<br />I own both the original and &quot;special&quot; editions of the trilogy on VHS, so I get to pick and choose which ones I like the most.  I know that Lucas is going to release these movies on DVD at some point.  Perhaps it will be set up in a way that will allow fans to &quot;choose&quot; which version of each scene they want to see.  Now THAT would be something!<br />If you are one of the few out there who haven't seen or are familiar with these films, I'm not going to spoil the plot for you.  I will just say this - you OWE it to yourself to see these movies.  They are classics, now and forever.
B00005QDW1|4.0|So many different opinions of No Doubt have flown around in the past few years since 1995's breakthrough Tragic Kingdom. In a lot of ways, that album, which bridged the gaps between punk rock and ska; seemed to sealed their fate. Their 2000 album Return Of Saturn was an accomplished followup, but lacked Tragic's massive appeal. This time around, No Doubt dares to dream of experimentation even though their last effort fizzled a little. Rock Steady is an album that makes a strong case for itself to those who diss Gwen and company. New wave may be the next wave of 2002, who knows? Its definitely sounding hella good on this side of the map, but how new wave and reggae laced with trip hop mesures up to the masses is out of my hands. The first single &quot;Hey Baby&quot; demands attention with that infectious hook that doesnt say much, but maybe says enough. After all, its about groupies. The band hasnt forgot their orange county ska/reggae roots, and for some reason accusers of selling out overlooked Return of Saturn's &quot;Bathwater&quot; and &quot;Marry Me&quot; tracks. &quot;Underneath It All&quot; can easily be a Tragic Kingdom song, with Gwen singing her not so deep, but honest lyrics, accompanied by Lady Saw, who sounds much better with Gwen and the boys then Vitamin C. &quot;Making Out&quot; is another example of Gwen's peter pan syndrome; a song about anticipating a make out session and not much else.Come on Gwen, isnt it time? Even Janet Jackson had to stop singing &quot;Lets Wait Awhile&quot; sooner or later. Still, its another irresistable tune, with a Blondie-like spunk and William Orbit production. One of the big surprises is how well the genres meshed together. On &quot;Waiting Room&quot;, with guest Prince, we hear all the Gwens from the other 4 albums, and the sounds of those times, plus a tribal-like rhythm from Orange County's parallel universe. Really the only one on here that isnt too catchy is &quot;Running&quot; and as Gwen sings on &quot;Underneath&quot;, ..and when its really bad/ I guess its not that bad. A line from their &quot;Move On&quot; song back in '92 said it like this: Dont forget your roots/but also dont rot/move on/move on/move on. That couldnt be more relevent in No Doubt's second decade.
B00005UKE0|5.0|This remastered album on 2 CDS is just very,very beautiful.<BR>It brings one back to this particular time of one's life as a reflection of personal time. George was a pretty cool dude who wrote some great songs and gave us some beautiful tunes to make us stop and think. Its also at a good price so everyone can afford it!!!!!
B000059MEK|4.0|That dynamic duo Daft Punk is back with full force. Discovery shimmers like a shiny new space helmet and beeps and scratches like its nobody's business. &quot;One More Time&quot; is one of those sticky dance tunes that are just inescapable. The DJs disguised as robots mix funk with disco, rock, and glossy french house with a radio-ready pop finish. Discovery may get more airplay than 1997's Homework, with &quot;One More Time&quot;, the sappy &quot;Digital Love&quot;, and &quot;Aerodynamic&quot;. The album does seem to lose steam toward the end, however, but theres so many standouts, its well worth a spin. One of my top picks for 2001. Youre a loser if you miss this one.
6305265666|5.0|Drew Barrymore is perfect as a strong, courageous, imaginative Cinderella, whose prince falls in love with her for her character and wit rather than her beauty. Angelica Huston is absolutely splendid as the wicked stepmother. She and Drew Barrymore make this movie! The supporting actors are also superb. The setting is realistic and the human psychology far more realistic than the fairy-tale cartoon that everyone has seen. Get this!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I'm amazed at the fact that decades go by and some people still insist on reviewing Dylan's work on the grounds of &quot;good voice&quot;. Some of the hollow pop artists that are being released these days have beautiful voices, too bad they have a complete lack of soul. &quot;Love and Theft&quot; is one of Dylan's best because of its sincerity. A simple truth in Dylan's mouth will always sound more beautiful than all the overproduced lies being played nowadays on the radio. Do yourself a favor and get this record.
B00005LMBK|4.0|this cd is AWESOME!!! its been in my cd player for two days straight (i only got the cd yesterday). i first heard about the gorillaz when i saw the video for &quot;clint eastwood&quot; on MTV and we all (my family) thought it was really kewl. i LUVED the cd and im what would be considered by most to be a &quot;teenybopper&quot;. my dad also luved the cd and he listens to classic rock (the same stuff he listened to in college, such as the strawbs, journey, the eagles...ask your parents). i reccomend this cd to anyone who has eclectic music tastes.
B00003CXCS|5.0|Great DVD set.  Lots of worthwhile extras, and the movie sounds and looks great.  A keeper!
B000002L9W|3.0|After waiting patiently after the break up, fans finally got treated to the David Lee Roth solo effort. The Van Halen brothers already had their material ready when Dave left the band. All they had to do was find a singer who can come up with some words to the riffs Eddie and Dave already worked on. Dave had to start from scratch with a new band. That is why this record took longer to come out, and explains why, in my opinion, 5150 is a better record than this one. The tour on this record, however, kicked major tail, leaving Van Halen flabbergasted. This record can be called &quot;cheesy&quot; by todays standards, but back then, it was rock 'n roll.
B00005221M|5.0|Love the movie, but not a lot of extras (other than the extra scenes..but those were shown on TV recently).  <br />The DTS decoded by my Samsung DVD-M301 caused audible fragmentation and skipping of the music and audio during music-rich scenes (opening credits, etc).  The problem is fixed by 'dumbing down' to DDigital.  I say 'dumbing-down' because I believe DDigital was part of original DVD.  I suspect the conversion 'upgrade' to DTS is the culprit behind the DTS problems.  But all in all, DTS handled the majority of the movie very well.  <br />Highly recommended movie!
B00005JCCE|5.0|There are a lot of reviews for this film that accuse it of being overdramatized or presenting only one side of the conflict Patch had with the conventional practice of doctors.  That is all fine and at least partially true, but I don't think it makes a bad movie.  On overdramatization, I respond that this movie is, in fact, drama.  Of course it is going to be more dramatic than real life - this should come as no shock to anyone ready to purchase the film.  At no point does it extend into nor approach the realm of melodrama.  There are also some problems with the romance.  It is, get this, romantic.  What audacity!  Patch's advances are quite consistent with his character and with Neruda's poem: straightforward and without pride.  It is not unbelievable that someone would read poetry to the woman he loves, and it is unfortunate that people find it so disturbing and laughable.  The romance may not be typical - it may even be idealistic (gasp!) - but it fulfills its dramatic function well and in a consistent fashion.<BR>     As for the one-sided presentation, this is neither atypical nor surprising.  It is the nature of most things with a theme.  Patch Adams has a clear argument: it does not make its sympathies ambiguous like some movies may, and that is okay.  Most intelligent viewers, and anyone willing to pursue the theme in their lives, will soon recognize that.  And that it changed people's lives is not surprising either: it is idealistic.  We should always pursue ideals, or at least have them in mind.<BR>     In the end, Patch Adams is a well-made movie that has a lot to offer people who are open to its message.  It is a refreshing dose of idealism put the purpose of acheiving a practical, acheivable goal in the face of the cynical and jaded colleagues (much like some of the reviewers of this film!).  It may not be wholly realistic, in spite of being based on a true story.  But then, neither are many books whose themes we accept without doubting the plausabilityof the vehicle of that theme.  That is the beauty of art - we can mix and amplify the real and the unreal, and let the one approximate the other to say what we want to say.<BR>     I will not comment on whether this movie is entertaining or not.  It is not an insubstantial movie, and its theme is worthwhile, whether you agree with it or not.  I invite anyone to watch this movie with their eyes open and minds working, to find its strengths without dwelling on its weaknesses, focusing on what it does say rather than how it says it, or what it fails to say.
B00004U8JU|5.0|All in all, a great DVD. The first scene with the TRex is phenomenal in the surround sound environment. Is there much difference detween DD and DTS?  Not that I could tell.  I do love DTS in general, but not sure the difference is too appreciable here.  Question is..  are the extras on the DD version more valuable to you than the slight improvement DTS provides on this disc?
B00005NVT1|4.0|I got this CD after owning Homework - and I loved it SO MUCH!  Well, I thought - Live CD, from 1997 (same year Homework was released) Must be great! - well, it's pretty good I guess.  I don't regret my purchase at all, let's just say it doesn't stay in any of my CD players as often as Homework does or Discovery will (ordered it; haven't got it yet; heard most of it).  But it's pretty cool, still.  It's kind of like a megamix of some Homework tracks and some original stuff just for this concert, plus the fans screaming and it's 45 minutes of entertainment.  My only nitpick is that they didn't do Around the World - must have done this concert before they made that track - cause it's the best song in the world, it really is. =) Oh well, at least we hear Da Funk (the second best song in the world)!<br />If you aren't sure whether to buy or not, compromise and get it used for half the price - but it's worth getting new just for the neat lil stickers!! =)
B00005R87Q|2.0|This is a very simple and navie movie of car racing. I just can't help laughing when seeing guys just simply pressing button to win the race. No corner, just a straight runway in the races.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido's debut CD &quot;No Angel&quot; has to be one of the best CDs of the year. She manages to master the soft pop/rock style while at the same time catching your ear with interesting lyrics. &quot;Don't Think of Me&quot; is one of the stand-outs on the CD, with a 70s feel to it. &quot;All That you Want&quot; has a bouncy pop quality to it while still being mellow. This is a CD that you can listen to over and over again. Great soft rock for good listening.
0061040967|4.0|This is the pseudo-Latin motto of the brave space adventurers of Pratchett and Kidby's The Last Hero. If you're surprised to find that it translates to &quot;We Who Are About To Die Don't Want To&quot;, this must be your first trip to the Discworld.<br />In many ways this is the most epic of all Discworld adventures. The travels of Cohen the Barbarian (and cohorts) and Rincewind the coward (and companions) take us to Dunmanifestin (home of the gods), over the edge of the Rimfall (where we discover there are actually people living on the SIDE of the Discworld -- I sense a future tale being set up) into the void, over the shell of the mighty spacefaring turtle A'Tuin and through the legs of the giant world-carrying elephants, and to the surface of the moon itself. And happily, the Librarian is along for the ride (though, sadly, the Luggage makes only a cameo appearance).<br />And the illustrations of Paul Kidby give the tale an extra dimension of wonder; each gorgeous, hilarious, perfectly-rendered painting builds upon the words and makes the story deeper and richer. The artwork is not simply slapped in between chapters, but rather is integral to the advancement of the story. The sketches from Leonard's notebook are vital to the story, and the renderings of Death cradling a kitten, and of Ponder Stibbons wearing his &quot;Actually I AM a Rocket Wizard&quot; T-shirt are priceless in their own ways. Kidby's art is a great asset, and I am already hungry for another collaboration between him and Pratchett.<br />My only complaint is that the story itself feels a bit choppy. The situations and the character moments are among Pratchett's best -- especially Rincewind's resignation to his participation in the dangerous adventure, and his regrettable familiarity with space travel, Cohen and his Silver Horde, and many other hazardous elements he has spent his cowardly life trying, but miserably failing, to AVOID -- but the actual flow of the story feels, at times, forced and awkward, as if Pratchett were trying to work around the artwork and not quite succeeding. It's not a bad story by any stretch of the imagination, but it's less cohesive than some of his other works and could have used another go-through by an editor. But still, a slightly less than his best effort from Pratchett is miles ahead of the best works from most anyone else.<br />In short, The Last Hero is an absolutely essential addition to the library of any Discworld fan, as well as the library of any fan of humor, fantasy, adventure, just plain good writing, or wonderful art.
B000003TAW|5.0|this is one of my all time favorite records. its that band you can't seem to get enough of. a must have for anyone of any age. rivers and the gang will make your heart melt too.
B00005QDW1|1.0|I have Been a No Doubt Fan For A LONG time and i must say this is the WORST cd by them i have heard. There is nothing &quot;rock&quot; about this CD and i have a question for all of u.... this is a band right? then why is it on the ONLY good song on the cd (Hey Baby) is Gwen The Only one who has anything to do with that song? she is amazing and the group is GREAT but come on we want something like &quot;Don't Speak&quot; &amp; &quot;Spider Webs&quot; and the only song this seems to offer up is Hey Baby
0767836286|4.0|There is no doubt about it, &quot;Arlington Road&quot; is definitely one of the most disturbing, horrifying, shocking, heart-pounding thrillers made.  Now, after the horrifying and unspeakable terrorist attacks on this country on September 11th, this movie is even more horrifying and hard to stomach.  Be warned; this is a very shocking and uneasy movie that you will never forget, even if you want to.<br />&quot;Arlington Road&quot; stars Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins.  After meeting the all-too-perfect family, Bridges starts to suspect that his neighbor, Robbins, just might not be the standup guy that he appears to be.  After seeing some shocking and questioning clues to Robbins' past, he starts to suspect that a terrorist is living in his neighborhood and plans to do unspeakable damage and terror somewhere.  Is Bridges just plain paranoid, or has he stumbled on a conspiracy that can destroy many lives?  All I can say without giving too much, the ending will scare the hell out of you, and will leave you devastated.<br />This movie was already disturbing way before September 11th, but now the movie is even more shocking and horrifying.  It shows you that terror can strike anywhere and can hide behind anyone.  Terror has no true identity and has no face.  It shows us just how little we know about the world we live in.  It also shows us that sometimes the most ordinary person can do unspeakable things.<br />Is the movie disturbing and hard to watch?  Yes.  Will the ending either terrify or anger you?  Most likely.  But this movie succeeded in terrifying me and keeping me at the edge of my seat.  The primary goal of a thriller is to keep you guessing and on edge, no matter how gruesome and disturbing the movie may be.  I thought this was a great thriller that will never leave my mind and that it was very well directed and acted out.  Disturbing as it may be, it is a brilliant thriller that you will never forget.  There are some fine extras on the DVD, including a behind-the-scenes feature, commentary, and a theatrical trailer of the movie.  (You may want to save the trailer for when you finish the movie.  I feel that it gives away the movie a little.)<br />I hope this review hasn't given away too many secrets, for there are many haunting ones you will encounter in this dark film.  There are many people who will hate this movie and be angered by it.  I think it's a grim reminder that we don't live in a perfect and safe world after all.  Watch this one at your own risk.the-scenes feature, commentary, and a theatrical trailer of the movie.  (You may want to save the trailer for when you finish the movie.

B00005MNP7|5.0|The album opens with the crisp and fast paced &quot;Dreaming&quot; with aggressive percussion and rollicking guitars. This first track sets an uptempo mood for what ends up becoming a very solid and entertaining album. <BR>Blondie became more than just another new wave band. They broke through to become an enduring all time favorite like groups such as The Police, The Clash and several other early KROQ types.<BR>The album continues with a variety of different types of songs from the calypsoish &quot;Die Young Stay Pretty&quot;, which includes some interesting percussion work, to the disco flavored hit &quot;Atomic&quot;.<BR>The spacey type ballad &quot;Shayla&quot; shows Debbie Harry's versatility as a vocalist. &quot;Accidents Never Happen&quot; (my favorite track) is straight forward new wave with a consistent rhythm which keeps the track moving smoothly. The album ends with the punk influenced &quot;Living In The Real World&quot;.<BR>&quot;Eat To The Beat&quot; is one of rock music's very best albums. &quot;Parrellel Lines&quot; was spectacular, though &quot;Eat To The Beat&quot; takes it one step further and shines as a classic of classics.
B00005RFAI|5.0|P!nk's new CD, Missundaztood, is amazing. Almost all of her songs have a meaning to them, whether it's obvious or not.<BR>The best songs, in my opinion, are Don't let me get me, Family Portrait, and Lonely Girl.<BR>Don't let me get me is about wanting to change who you are and get the respect that she deserves.<BR>Family Portrait is about her parents fighting and her wanting to stop it.<BR>The whole CD is really amazing and SO much better than her first CD, which was mostly rap/hip-hop. This CD brings together different aspects of music with the amazing lyrics.
B00003CXCQ|3.0|My 2 year old daughter absolutely loves this film. And as her loving father, I have watched SNOW WHITE with her now countless times. Back when I was single, I found SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS (dwarves?), to be boring and weak on story. But now seeing it through my daughter's eyes, seeing her pure glee as Snow White befriends and sings and dances with the little people... it's all extremely charming and heart warming.    But here's what I don't understand. The Evil Queen is the \\"fairest one of them all\\" for quite a while, until Snow White suddenly wakes up one morning (puberty completes?) and is declared by the Magic Mirror to be the fairest one in the land. So now the Evil Queen is the SECOND fairest one of all. Not such a bad thing to be, really, particularly given her age. But she gets so enraged by being bumped down to the second slot that death to her own step-daughter appears to be the only reasonable answer.    After the Huntsman warns Snow White and lets her escape (as opposed to taking advantage of the \\"fairest one\\" and then killing her with the Queen's permission), the Queen decides she's going to take care of her herself. And how does she do it? The Queen opens her huge spellbook and CHANGES HER APPEARANCE into that of an old beggar woman. Why not just change your appearance back again to become the fairest of them all?!? Why does regaining the title of the fairest cause her to instead change into a wretchedly ugly beast? That seems like poor planning.    Or why not just let Snow White run off with that Prince at the very start (she watches them from the window)? Then Snow White would be out of the Queen's hair and she'd again be fairest.    Cartoons are so hard!
0385505833|5.0|I purchased the audio book to listen while I drive to work on slick, snow covered roads.  It was a refreshing break from the fears of the past several days and the tragedy in the United States.  Luther Crank made me laugh non-stop the last ten chapters.  It ended wonderfully.  It is not what we get (or give) ourselves for Christmas that matters, or even what we give others, but how we give it.  Thanks John!
B00005QIPH|5.0|I can't believe I made it through the greater part of the year without owning this record. It's excellent. These guys reverberate back and forth between a droned out or half speed version of the Ramones and an Ed Sullivan &quot;prime time&quot; version of Johnny Thunders. What I mean is that some songs are somewhat subdued and others are pretty rockin', but not to a dissonant level. It's energetic, but somehow controlled. I guess the best way to describe this album is punk meets math rock and gives birth to blissful beauty. When I first got this record I must've listened to it 30 times in a row and since then it's remained in heavy rotation. Don't let this one pass you by.
B00005JKT8|5.0|I saw this movie today, and it was the cutest movie. Hugh Jackman is one of the hottest actors in the movies. I definitely recommend this movie to viewers.
B00005JKES|4.0|Well TWIN PEAKS is finally on DVD, accompanied by all the great extra features, MUCH better picture quality, and great sound, perfect right?...Wrong.<br />First off, the pilot rights are owned by another company so it is not included in this set.  You feel like you are walking into a movie that has been playing for a half hour already.  Second, the special features for each episode are unaccessible on my copy of the DVD but the special features included on the last disc are extensive and interesting.<br />Overall, I am glad to own this on DVD but feel a twinge of regret.  It just seems to me that eventually the studio gurus will stop their pissing contest and put out a complete &quot;special edition&quot; set with the pilot, first, and second season.  For now I am happy to watch this and revel in the bizarre worlds of David Lynch.
B00005QDW1|1.0|Only two words for me can sum up this disc, \\"Severe Disappointment\\" I have enjoyed much of No Doubt's music past and near present, but this is one of the \\"Most deadly boring\\" CDs ever listened too.  It's hard to tell when a new song comes on, 'cause they all sound pretty much the same.  Very toned down and hard to tolerate.  Although some may praise the CD for going into new music territory, I see little reason to congratulate the group for putting it's listeners fast asleep.  Only for the most die-hard No Doubt fan, who will just like it, because they are the featured artist, and don't judge the music by it's content...
B00005QDW1|5.0|When I read the review of this CD they only gave it 2.5 stars and that is a totally unfair review. This CD is great, it has &quot;Hey Baby&quot; the already cut single which is great and the unknown tracks are great too. This is a great buy.
B00003CXAA|4.0|Coppola's trilogy has withstood the test of time well. The first film has a number of strong moments but, ultimately, both Michael and Kaye's characters are underwritten. Overall, the tone and writing are amazingly consistent from film to film. The picture and sound quality is truly outstanding. Coppola's comments are very interesting and add depth to the film.<br />The second film tends to be the strongest of the series. All the characters are more fully realized and have clearer motivation. The picture quality for the second film is stunning given the age of the negative. Both the sound and picture have been cleaned up for DVD release.<br />The third film is a bit more problematic. Coppola's operatic finale to the Godfather saga sags a bit because of all the plot threads he tries to resolve. Nevertheless, Coppola and his collaborator Puzo manage to pull it all together.<br />Andy Garcia is well cast although under used in his role. Sophia Coppola doesn't have the strong acting skills of Winona Ryder (originally castin the film) but she still manages to pull off her role with grace. Yes, she's miscast and yes, she's out of her element given the actors she's working with but given that this is her debut she does a credible job.<br />The strongest parts of the third film are the various set pieces. The attempted assination at the opera is brilliantly realized. Pacino gives an admirable performance as Michael. The film really could have used Robert Duvall in his role as Tom the family attorney (he was holding out for more money and took Days of Thunder instead). George Hamilton gives a credible performance but, again, lacks the screen presence of Duvall. I don't doubt there would have been more cinematic sparks flying if Pacino and Duvall had appeared on screen together again. It's clear that when Duvall turned down the role, the part was reduced and rewritten for Hamilton.<br />The three films together work much better than the three alone. Even if Coppola didn't intend this to be a trilogy when he started out, all three films benefit from the ability to watch the characters grow.end this to be a trilogy when he started out, all three films benefit from the ability to watch the characters grow.
B00002E23E|3.0|As a collector of Zeppelin live shows, it is disappointing that the only official chronicle of one of the 3 greatest live bands of the '70s (Zep, Floyd, WHO...honorable mention to the Stones) was from the ill fated Houses of the Holy tour.  Maybe Jimmy will finally do us all justice and finally release both a cd and video anthology of the vast amount of high quality live Zeppelin material.  Until then, this is what we have........
B00005OWEG|4.0|The last time I saw this film was 20 years ago. I watched Redux and I thought the movie held it's own against the original version.<BR>I did not particularly like the French Plantation diatribe at the dinner table and found it a waste of time. They could have shortened that to 3-4 minutes. Boring and too long.<BR>However, I found the added Playboy scene worthy. Robert Duval was excellent. Martin Sheen was awesome. Brando creepy.<BR>Redux was a good effort and actually I am glad Coppola completed the film the way he wanted.  I wish they had more special features or documentary material. This was a major weak point. Coppola makes great movies and great wine to boot!

B00005OAJ1|4.0|My first experience with the &quot;D&quot; was seeing them open for Ween at Red Rocks. My next was when i heard the album. Finally i saw the Episodes.<br />The live show kicked all sorts of ass,the album is pretty good and the episodes also kick ass...<br />My recomendation is to buy the album.(from a local store if possible) just because the &quot;D&quot; are a revolution! They are were the perfect opener for Ween and that is not an easy feat!
B000053VAZ|3.0|Okay, let's clear this up... From a purely entertainment standpoint, I loved this movie. The only reason I took two stars away from this DVD is the horrific commentary. The director basically tells us what's going to happen in the current scene through out the entire film. Now, while this may be a bonus for someone who may be visually impaired, I found it to be very boring. There were no funny tales of things that happened on this day or that. There was nothing informative such as problems they had to overcome, or camera lenses. I almost fell asleep. I know what you're saying... &quot;Why didn't you turn it off?&quot; I kept expecting it to get better. It had to. I was indeed absolutely wrong. Don't waste your time. But definitely watch the film. Oliver Platt is a comic genius, and many don't realize he has a part in this film. :)
B00005R87Q|4.0|hollywood makes a big difference, especially with real world topics like street racing. myself, like thousands of street racers who watched this movie noticed the hollywood twists, and turns. like the the 10 minute quarter mile, 4 cars down a track, using NoS after you shift from third, fine looking chicks racing andworking on cars. c'mon, one of the slowest cars i've scene on the quarter mile was around 18 sec., if you street race in cali, you can only race 2 cars down a track, that can barely  fit spectators and the cars that race, NoS is for the take off, turbo does the high end work, and fine chicks working on and racing cars, have you street racers seen lisa kubo? but ..., i liked it. a lot of real world tech. most was done by the editor of super street, which made a god combo with the movie. they had the sponsors, NoS, veilside, hks, greddy, bomex, and the list goes on, including some internet street racing sites. so the cars were close to reality as hollywood would try to bend. reality, yes the cops do bum rush the tracks, and khaos breaks out, especially when the track is poppin, but to sum this short little article up street racing deserves the attention. as an ongoing street racer, i recomend this flick, but if you are a REAL racer, look at what's hollywood, and look at what's REAL!!! <br />BaY aReA/NoR-CaL representin.........

6303269826|5.0|I have seen every Wyatt Earp movie, documentary, etc. on Wyatt Earp, and there is no doubt that this movie is by far the best.  I completely disagree that Tombstone is better.  For one, Dennis Quaid is outstanding.  This is the best performance he has ever done, and he puts Val Kilmer to shame as 'Doc'.  This movie is also much more informative and accurate than Tombstone.  Kevin Costner does a top notch job, and the expanded story line actually gives excellent insight as to why Wyatt Earp was so fearless, and why he acted as though he had nothing to lose.  Great movie, should be out on DVD!

B00003CXZ4|5.0|Formalistic experiments in film can be a hit-or-miss affair.  Most filmmakers playing with form -- in narrative or visual presentation -- find it difficult to marry the experiments they want to conduct with a compelling story.  Memento writer/director Christopher Nolan flies out from among his competition by finding a story which by nature demands an unconventional narrative approach, making Memento the four-aces masterpiece it is.<br />The amazing thing is that Nolan makes you hang on to a story in which you find out the ultimate outcome of the plot in the very beginning.  Memento, however, makes you care about *how* something happened, the cause of the effects, and somehow manages to generate suspense even though you're watching events unfold backwards.  An astonishing writing feat.  The actors do a terrific job -- Guy Pearce wisely holds himself back and delivers a low-key, simmering performance and a deadpan voice-over job that are instantly winning; Carrie-Anne Moss continues to make smart choices in edgy roles, not content to milk her sex-symbol status; Joe Pantoliano's smarmy charisma comes through yet again as he chomps lines with gusto, coming out with some of the funniest moments in the film.  Nolan mines the central conceit of a character with no short-term memory for fresh comedic moments, and this also helps keep your attention even if you might sometimes get lost in its complicated plot.  And of course, the bounty of story twists and revelations make this movie a terrific rewatch experience.<br />One of the best films of 2001, and certainly the most original.
0451169514|5.0|Simply said it's his best. The seven characters who confront 'IT' both as children and again as adults become your friends by the time you finish.<br />The book is 100 times better than the movie. The movie was terrible and left out 75% of the story and events. Read the book.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Though I love rock music, I don't tend to like movies about rock music. This one did me in. An overwhelming charm seeps from every frame of this movie, every character, every moment, making it impossible for me to imagine that Cameron Crowe ever had doubts about bringing this story to life.<br />If you enjoyed the strengths of Almost Famous, I think the &quot;bootleg/Untitled&quot; cut of this movie will only make the movie better for you. It is essentially a more detailed, slightly slower-paced, but richer version of the movie, where the magic moments take more time to unfold, the sense of reality is more firmly established, and the characters are better explored. Billy Crudup and Jason Lee are absolutely wonderful as the feuding vocalist/guitarist team; Patrick Fugit brings much innocent charm and emotional honesty; Philip Seymour Hoffman, Fairuza Balk, Zooey Deschanel, Noah Taylor and Frances McDormand are all sublime; and of course, Kate Hudson steals the show as one of the most adorable characters I've ever seen, a combination of naive sensuality, sheer joie de vivre, and romantic longing. Crowe richly deserved his Best Screenplay Oscar, as well -- this movie contains magic moments aplenty, and the dialogue shifts effortlessly from the gloriously funny to the achingly heartfelt.<br />The bonus materials are abundant -- this is more than just a bootleg, it's a veritable boxed set. A Stillwater music CD, an interview with Lester Bangs, outtakes (including one patience-testing, but still amusing sequence shot of Penny Lane -- smart not to include in either version of the movie), transcripts of Crowe's original Rolling Stone articles -- in a year of great DVD releases, this one stands on its own, even among Criterion's Hitchcock releases, the Godfather DVD set, and the second season of The Sopranos.<br />Cameron Crowe's love of music has translated into cinematic form. And the feeling envelops us all. We are the better for it.
0930289331|5.0|For all the none comic book fans out there, if you pick up only one comic book in your lifetime, make it Frank Miller's &quot;The Dark Knight Returns.&quot;  However, if you pick up two, make &quot;Batman: Year One&quot; (also by Miller) the other one.  Basically, this is a retelling of the earliest days of Bruce Wayne's career as Batman, which neatly parallels then Lieutenant Jim Gordon's earliest days in the Gotham police force, before he becomes comissioner.<br />The artwork in this book is outstanding but what really sets this apart is the storyline.  Miller basically with this book and &quot;Dark Knight Returns&quot; completely redefined the Batman mythology, turning Batman from a sometimes campy, sometimes sci-fi-ish character into something gritty, psychological and startlingly real.  In fact, Miller has been pegged by Warner Brothers to script the new Batman movies so if you want a glimpse at what may unfold in them, look no further.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I have seen the Fellowship of the Ring twice so far and I have got to say that this soundtrack matches the tone of Peter Jackson's direction and Tolkien's imagination flawlessly.  It makes you want to listen to it until you're able to see the epic on screen again.  <BR>  I have read all three books, again, twice all the way through, just in the last week listening to the masterfully done score by Howard Shore.  I must say that when i first heard that John Williams wasn't going to be doing the movie soundtrack for The Fellowship of the Ring, I was heartbroken, but not anymore.  Howard Shore has put together 18 tracks of beautiful poetry without words.  Well mostly without words, the last track &quot;May It Be&quot; by Enya deserves to not only win the Golden Globe that it is nominated for but also it should be nominated and win the Oscar for best song, it's an impeccable piece.<BR>  But my favorite track is the second one &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; whenever i hear this song I could just see Hobbit children dancing around in Hobbiton while the adults make smoke rings.  This is a soundtrack that will be left in my cd changer for many a year, &quot;there and back again.&quot;

B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus's morning view is a sign of true musicianship in a world that seems to full of complete crap.  Although unfairly tagged as &quot;just another metal band&quot;, incubus strays far from the pack as they display cretive abilty as well as poeticness in their 3rd real album.  Since there first album Enjoy Incubus(Although only a couple tracks), Incubus has shown that they can encorporate all different kinds of music in a small package.  With amazing and inspiring lyrics and music that exists on a different level than the normal pop rock bands, incubus has achieved something specail with morning view.  Incubus shows that a rock band doesn't have to be all about cheesy love songs and displays real originality with tracks like &quot;Aqueous Transmission.&quot;(of which they should be especailly proud)  Here they show how diverse their music can be, starting with what seems like an ancient chinese melody then cleverly adding record scratching and bass lines to accompany the amazing lyrics.  Tracks like &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; make the album still apealing to those who began to follow incubus in their &quot;Science&quot; days when they had a much more raw, loud sound than what it is today.  Other tracks, like &quot;Mexico&quot;(my personal favorite) use unorthadox guitar lines with a flowing cello line(one of the many added orchestral intraments throughout the albumn)that makes me want to listen to the cd for hours on end.  In some tracks, orchestral arrangements are added to the music that makes it even more diverse and appealing.  Incubus seem to be pioneering this new style of genre mixing music that can appeal to a wide range of music lovers.  There is one warning however when buying this cd, and that is that it's not for everybody.  If your looking for love ballads or boyband dance music, then stay away from this cd.  You also have to realize that not all Incubus's music is like &quot;Drive&quot;. (probably their best known song to the new fans)  The music can be strange at some points but never dull.  Lyrics are to be interpreted, which can usually be done through the music, a perfect counterpart to the wonderful words.  Their music seems to always have a characteristic that makes it an original artwork, which makes me encourage you to buy the cd.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Yes I like Manson..sue me! I liked this album and Antichrist superstar..still don't know what i liked better. I love the songs on this Album &quot;I wanna disappear&quot; &quot;Rock is Dead&quot; &quot;I don't Like the drugs but the drugs like me&quot; and &quot;dopeshow&quot; I think the rest of the songs are good to but these are my favorits.<br />thats all I gotta say!
B000002MFE|5.0|lets put things clear: ERIC CLAPTON MADE THE FENDER STRATOCASTER GREAT, NOT THAT THE FENDER MADE GREAT ERIC CLAPTON. I FIRST HEARD THIS MUSIC WHEN I RENTED IT ON VIDEO MANY YEARS AGO, AND LET ME TELL YOU MAN,HE IS NOT GOD (IM A CATHOLIC), BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU, BY THE WAY HE PLAYED THOSE GUITARS, HE IS NOT HUMAN, HE DID SOME THINGS WITH HIS INSTRUMENTS THAT ITS IMPOSIBLE FOR A HUMAN BEING TO ACOMPLISH, THAT DAY I WITNESSED ART( LIKE I SAID: WHAT ITS GREAT ITS THAT MANS ABILITY, ALTHOUGH THIS IS MY FAVORITE CD, I LIKE VERY MUCH ALL OF HIS ELECTRIC WORK), THAT MADE ME RUN THE NEXT DAY INTO THE NEAREST CD STORE AND BUY IT. SINCE THEN I PLAY IT ALMOST EVERY DAY: THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SONG IN THERE THAT ITS NOTHING BUT EXCELLENT, ALTHOUGH I HAVE SOME PREFERENCES: 1. OF COURSE MY SECOND FAVORITE SONG OF ALL TIME (NEXT TO ELTON JOHNS THE MEASURE OF A MAN): TEARS IN HEAVEN ( I PREFER THIS ACOUSTIC VERSION), 2. LAYLA ( ALTHOUGH I LIKE VERY VERY MUCH THE ORIGINAL VERSION AND ITS INSTRUMENTAL FADE OUT, BUT LIKE I REPEAT THE MAGIC IN THE SONGS IS THE WAY ERIC PLAYS), 3. RUNNIG ON FAITH.  AND THE REST OF IT HAS A LOT OF GREAT GREAT STUFF, ALL KIND OF BLUES ( I LIKE VERY MUCH LONELY STRANGER), HAPPY BLUES LIKE SAN FRANCISCOS, THERE ARE ALSO SAD BLUES, AND BLUES BLUES. THIS ALBUM TIES FOR MY NUMBER ONE ALBUM OF ALL TIME WITH THE ROCKY V SOUNDTRACK( FOR THE SONG THE MEASURE OF A MAN, THAT I HAD TO WAIT FOR 8 PLUS YEARS, TIL I BOUGHT IT HERE). THIS CD IS THE MATERIAL PROOF THAT  E.C. CAN DO EXCELLENT WITH OR WITH OUT ALL THE ELECTRIC STUFF. THE REAL RATE FOR THIS CD IS : INFINITY OF STARS, BUT I HAVE TO SETTLE FOR ONLY 5.
B000002G30|5.0|What more can be said about Monster Magnet? That they are one of the last orginal rock bands in existance? That their sound is a culmination of everything from punk to heavy metal? That Dave Wyndorf is a genius? All have been said before. The proof? This album: Dopes to Infinity. <br />from the very beginning Dopes to Infinity is something special. The title track is not only heavy, blusy, and smashed, it is almost anthem like to the point where the word &quot;beautiful&quot; is not over doing it. The blistering assault of Negasonic Teenage Warhead is a quintacential hook of the album. With an infinitly hummable tune and a chorus you'll find yourself singing aloud to yourself. Look to Your Orb for the Waring is is perhaps the albums best song musically with it's obvious nods to not only Sabbath and Deep Purple, but also to Pink Floyd and even Nirvana. I Control I fly is one of the heavyest tracks to ever come out of the band, burning with energy and Daves ego in full swing. Dead Christmas is the albums wild card. All it needs is Jim Morrison instead of Dave to make it a Doors song! The album as a whole is a phenomina not seen in ages. Like AC/DC's Back in Black, Magnet will more than likely never be able to top this release. Certainly almost nobody else can. My advice: By this album, you will not regret it.
B00003CXBK|5.0|OMG! I would of never thought this movie exsisted if I wouldn't of went for my instinct. My sister and I had gone to rent some movies, and I had been taking my time too pick out a Good DVD I would Enjoy. My sister was already done and rushed me telling me to hurry and just grab a movie. So I looked and looked and Thought I should get an anime movie and just grabbed one. Later getting in the car looking at the Title: Princess Mononoke didn't sound so pleasent. I figured it was probably another one of those Lamo Drama cartoons. Didn't think it would be so good. Got home didn't even touch the DVD till the day before it was due. I had nothing to do so Decided \\"What the Heck I'll watch it anyway\\" Poped it In, and from that Moment on, changed the way I thought about Anime movies. This Movie Probably out Toped momst of my favorites, I probably saw it like 20 times because it was soooo good. After returning it, i went out that day and bought me the DVD and soundtrack and fell in love with Both. Gosh, and sometimes I just wish they would of put this In Theaters, I sometimes wonder why they never put Anime's on Theaters besides Pokemon and all that .... I mean, my God this Movie Kicks Butt and I dont ever remember it coming out in Theaters. Someone has got to Get this Movie Out. It's totally a Must See! Sound, Story, Action, Love all jam packed into one Anime Movie and Each Part well played and well made. Music Just makes this movie carry on and makes viewers want more. I'm telling you if they came out with a part 2 that is good as this, I would be definitly there to see it first day it poped up...
0897500482|5.0|i just want to say...the whole point of the book is to expose &amp; open minds to not only a new form of martial arts but to a way of thinking that allows you to be in harmony with everything around you.<br />&quot;7 problems with &quot;The Art of Jeet Kune Do&quot; by Bruce Lee, August 25, 2001 Reviewer: BFGalbraith &quot;<br />THIS GUY was sooo close minded when he read it that he doesnt deserve to have the book...although its good he read it &amp; has many thoughts about it...i guess he was willing to give it a try but he didnt fully open himself to the ideas &amp; philosy of the book.  See, if he read it &amp; compared the styles of martial arts &amp; made them more efficient or understood why Bruce Lee would alter the moves &amp; go from there, his reading expierience would have been so much more enjoyable.  However , he just stopped reading the book &amp; started to compare &amp; critique it without fully understanding Bruce Lee's Book.
1556587864|1.0|I'm sorry, but this is just a ridiculous movie. <br />To me, the writing is stilted and feels false, for lack of a better word. The acted is consistently overdone and the direction is so calculated and false (again) that, to my mind, this movie is simply a waste of time. As a study of supposedly &quot;kinky&quot; sex, again, just dumb; it feels to me to be so obviously done to titilate the mainstream.<br />So many movies have been done so much better on so many levels than this thing. Just pathetic to see attention given to junk like this. <br />As a comparison, I happened to see The Godfather just prior to this and the feel of the two movies in comparison was so striking that this utterly paled. Granted, few films stand a chance when put against The Godfather, but this was so abrupt I was astounded at the utter badness of Basic Instinct. <br />Again, to me this is pure junk.
B00005QIPH|1.0|\\"Album of the Year 2001?\\"  And Amazon reviewers are still claiming this album \\"saved rock\\" 4 years later??  Ha! This is the effect of marketing to the masses by corporate propoganda in financially-connected publications of nepitism! Appreciating quality music is not something a poser can buy and wear by quickly hearing a few tidbits from the hype-mill and making a trip to the local suburban mall. Listen to the music, don't wear it on your sleave like a fashion statement.<br /><br />All copies of this CD should be hammered into microscopic bits and recycled into gallon milk jugs.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is the best movie I've ever seen, but I didn't know that the first time I watched it.  I knew that I liked it, but I wasn't sure whether I should feel a little guilty about that or not.  At first viewing, it seemed that it was a little offensive and brutal.  As I watched it a few more times, however, I came to realize that it is in fact a brilliant dark comedy.  While this movie has gotten a lot of bad publicity about its violence and all, it you pay attention you actually notice that rarely is violence glorified, and is usually made fun of in some way or shown to be silly and excessive.  In fact, anyone who says that it is filled with &quot;gory sensationalized meaningless violence&quot; has either never watched the movie or is incapable of seeing past the most obvious, superficial aspects of the film.  While the movie appears to be about the struggle of &quot;real men&quot; against the emasculating forces of modern society (most namely the scourge of Scandinavian furniture), it is actually about the struggle within one particular man (&quot;Jack&quot;) to discover himself.  It is witty, original, and facinating.  The more you watch it, the more you see and understand of both the plot and the underlying theme and purpose.  Oh yeah, Brad Pitt and Ed Norton are flawless as well.<br />That's the movie review.  Now on the the DVD.<br />While the movie itself is fantastic, the DVD itself is even better.  It is chocked full of special features, the best of which being the commentary track including David Fincher, Brad Pitt, Ed Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter.  I could spend lots of time detailing all of my favorite features, but I can far more easily just say that they're all very cool.  This fantastic movie and the peerless DVD make for a must buy.
B00005AXEL|4.0|Hard to realize that Stevie Nicks has become one of rock music's elder stateswomen, but here we are with a new album for the new century just to make sure the Fleetwood Mac reunion does not obscure her solo career.  Her voice might be aging, but this album proves that Stevie's sense of harmony is only getting sweeter with age, so I think of this as much more than some sort of compensation.  For me the best song on this album is &quot;Sorcerer,&quot; which I bet a lot of us remember from the &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; film, although she did not sing it then.  Like &quot;Silver Springs&quot; on &quot;The Dance,&quot; Stevie again finds her best moment on the album with a blast from the past.  This is also the song where producer Sheryl Crow makes the biggest impact on the album, and not just because she sings on the track; she also plays guitar and brings her own musical sensibility to the five tracks she co-produces, including my second favorite song, &quot;That Made Me Stronger.&quot;  Apparently I really like the synthesis of musical styles between the two. Stevie continues to show her musical diversity, from the country &quot;Too Far From Texas&quot; (with Natalie Maines helping to sing vocals) and the frenetic &quot;Fall From Grace.&quot;  Stevie certainly appreciates her producers, making a point of not only listing them song by song in the liner notes but on the back cover as well.  John Shanks is the producer on several tracks, including the title song and &quot;Every Day,&quot; and Pierre Marchand shows up with Sarah McLachlan and her band to do the album's final track, &quot;Love Is.&quot;  I guess that makes it pretty ironic, that Stevie gets back to her roots by helping some of the best of the next generation of female song writers do the same.  &quot;Trouble in Shagri-La&quot; is not a great album, just a very good one, which is perfectly fine.  It is not like the woman is trying to build a fan base here.  I just wish I had not had to wait until Christmas to finally get this one.s to finally get this one.
B00004TH83|3.0|she has a very attractive voice, its pleasant music, but, it all sounds like JACD (Just Another Celine Dion).<br />She sounds like a slightly younger Celine deliberately trying to follow in her footsteps.  <br />Nothing wrong with her as such, but she is so samey that if you like Celine and have her music, why bother with Lara?  If she had appeared before Celine maybe it would be her at the top, but I feel she needs to define something special to her first.<br />I would wish her well as I feel she has talent, but needs some good management.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Everything in this movie is bad, the acting, the color, the special effects, the credits are even horrible. Not since Showgirls has there been this kind of awful film making. It is, of course, laughable in all areas...no one scene can be singled out for its non cinematic style and bad acting. Ben Aflik once more proves he cannot be considered an actor of any stature. He should go back to whatever he was doing before Good Will Hunting. <br />All the others are terrible. Buy this and you buy travesty and trivia. An insult to the vets and even the Japanese.
6305558167|1.0|When I was little, I heard the classic tune &quot;O fortuna&quot; for the first time as a sound track of this movie. Finally, yesterday, I had a chance to watch the movie itself. I started with great expectation only to be deeply disappointed. Not consistent, no climax, no character development...just storytelling. Battle scene was disappointing too. Generallly just handful of soilders fight. Even I saw one of a sword simple bent (but the knight 'stabbed' by the bent sword was killed!). Duel scenes look ridiculous. Nudity made me doubt the whole movie. IMHO, it seems to be a cheesy one. Just very long movie without any fun or merit. One star is due to Patrick Stewart of Startrek fame.  Excalibur is not worth my 2.5 bucks.
B000002HRE|5.0|This CD is basicaly a mix of metallicas pure metal and country music. Even though this album was not as heavy as it was uppose to be........but i guess its okay<br />RECOMMENDED ALBUM : MASTER OF PUPPETS
B000021YQV|4.0|System of adown is a band that sound like unusuual yet original, and loud yet melodic and somewhat expiereimientel. The disc, only 44 minutes long begins with lead singer serj tankian whispering &quot;they're trying to build a prison&quot; and ends with an indian sounding flute and drums playing with occasional shouts. In betweent that time, you'll here some of the most innovative, socialy conciouse heavy metal out there these days. The lyrics are the albums real glory here, flowing in poetry ranging from topics such as a biting satire on the U.s prison system in &quot;Prison song&quot; to the anti-drug &quot;Psycho.&quot; Like Rage against the Machine, politics are very importent to this band and if your getting sick of the usual 'i hate myself and i mso depressed' type of lyrics that most heavy metal these days have, then this will be a relief.<BR>musically the album can get redundant, especially in the first five tracks, before the awesome &quot;Chop Suey&quot; Serj Tankians voice is a very unique one sometimes edgy and gritty, sometimes flat, making him sound somewhat like david byrn every now and then. The guitars are loud, fast paced and bone-crunching on most songs and on a few such as the title track, ringing and eerie.<BR>you definetly need to get this album, definitly if your a fan of heavy metal nad definetly if your someone searching, for intelligent, original music of any sort.
6304698798|1.0|Terrible. Director Leone amuses himself while showing the audience a self indulgent unbelieveable mess albiet beautifully photographed.
0380730405|5.0|I recently purchased this edition to give to a friend as a gift, and I was pleased to see that it had some nice extras, like du Maurier's early notes for the book.  I would definitely recommend this edition over the Avon edition, in part because I noticed that the Avon edition lists du Maurier as the author of that horrid sequel attempt, which was actually excreted by Susan Hill.  There's no telling what to expect from a publisher capable of such a mistake.<br />As for the novel itself, my original glowing review still stands.  This story will never lose its appeal for me.
0345404475|2.0|...overall a bit of a disappointment. The issues that Dick talks about, a society which degrades ''handicapped'' people, robots who are almost human but are in a sense ruthless because they kill humans to get to earth, are intriguing but the story never really developes and the end, in my opinion, is horrible. Some might see a hidden philosophical message in the ending but to me it was just an abrupt one which didn't make any sense. Other parts of the book are also confusing. I know that some people say that if you want a sci-fi book which is mostly based on reality, at least to a certain degree, Philip K. Dick is not the author whose stories you want to read. Nonetheless I had the feeling that parts of the story were just so far off that it really interrupted a good storyline. The characters never really develope and one has no clue as to why Deckard acts like he does when he meets Rachael in San Francisco. (I know I didn't)<br />Gotta give props to Ridley Scott who turned this average book into one of the best sci-fi movies ever. If you're a big Blade Runner fan you might want to read the book just to get another view but in the end you'll be happy that Scott's movie is based<BR>loosely on the book.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Regardless of your sexual orientation, this is a wonderfully told story that has excellent repeat-viewing potential.  I have seen this movie three times at the movie theater, and as of this Christmas, I am now the proud owner of the DVD :). Each time I view it, I catch things that I had previously missed.  The music alone is great enough, but the story is superb.  There have been many comparisons of this movie to Rocky Horror, but I feel that Hedwig is much deeper emotionally and at least has a more reasonable plot.  The extras on the DVD are delicious - the deleted scenes and commentary are a &quot;must view&quot; for any serious Hedwig fan.
B000001DTM|4.0|,Achtung Baby is U2's CD that has made me change my attitude towards the band. The rhythms and special effects are extremely creative especially on Zoo Station, Mysterious Ways, and So Cruel.<br />Furthermore, One is truly a beautiful emotional song. Definitely one of U2's all time best songs based on the lyrics, vocals, and effects. Love Is Blindness is another captivating piece. Love the piano accompanyment and the guitar soling at the end is just awesome.  Its certainly a team effort on those tracks although The Edge's contributions seem to stand out just a little bit more.<br />The band does over-rely on a similar pattern throughout many of the tracks. However,this is a minor drawback. But overall, this recording certainly has many good merits that even some non-fans can appreciate.
B000002JSP|2.0|Despite the name, which sounds like another name for ..., there's no really good tracks. Every song has those pop keyboards and very, very little guitar. In The Evening and I'm Gonna Crawl is good, if not excellent songs, but 15% that is good dosen't make me like the whol thing. Just download Track 1 and 7 and you'll be fine.
B00005QFE5|5.0|This is one of the most deeply moving films I have seen in a very long while. The story is sweet and meaningful, and the acting is absolutely exquisite. This film is lovely and quiet, beautifully filmed, and restrained. <br />One of the things that impressed me about the movie is the obvious acting talents of Zhang Ziyi, the actress who played Jen in Crouching Tiger. If you think you'll even recognize her in this role, I challenge you to see the movie to find even one remnant of Jen in her character. She is an excellent actress and conveys realms of thought and feeling without saying a single word.<br />If you're hoping for a fast-paced, run-of-the-mill movie you won't absorb, see something else. See 'The Road Home' if you want gorgeous and rich cinema.
B00004U2A2|1.0|Unitenntionally hilarity? Well, this is the best. It's so bad, it's good. Bruce Campbell, perhaps the only thing he says in this film is &quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot; You'll love it.
6302906636|4.0|It was a bad day for Connor Mcleod. Born in 1518 in Scotland, he went out to war and found he couldn't die. Not so bad in itself, 1518 was not a good time to be conspicuously different, and nothing raises more suspicions in times of brutal war than immortality. Bloody but alive, Mcleod is exiled and meets a man named Ramirez, sword-master to King Phillip, Shogun Matsemune, various Pharoh's, and - like Mcleod, an alleged immortal. It's Ramirez who clues Mcleod into his fate - to battle against other immortals spread around the world until he is the only one left. (They can be killed by having their heads chopped off - they are otherwise immune to old age, disease and lesser injuries). The ultimate victor will be awarded \\"The Prize\\" - nobody knows what the prize is but, given the pyrotechnics that mark the end of every fight, we just know it's got to rock. The other immortals have become fearsome warriors otherwise hidden from the each other but somehow drawn together by the mysterious \\"Quickening\\" - the magic that gives them their strength, their immortality and (unless they're fast with that broadsword) their doom. Among these other warriors is the Kurgan - a fearsome knight from the Russian Steppe where they toss the weak and the sick to pits of vicious dogs for fun. By modern days (actually, 1987), Mcleod and the Kurgan remain the last surviving \\"Immortals\\" - each one modern-savvy but also remaining their medieval selves deep down. While the rest of the world listens to CD's, and drives fast cars, the surviving immortals duke it out with broadswords on tops of buildings or in vacant lots in hearts of desiccated cities, each one not only fighting for his life, but for the priceless prize.<br />This was the first \\"Highlander\\" - before the sequels and the show - and the textbook case for a great movie that should have never become a franchise. (The studio should have taken the phrase \\"there can be only one!\\" more seriously). Sequels and the show spoiled the whole idea by trying to explain who the immortals are (actually aliens from a planet called Zeist, according to \\"Highlander 2: the Quickening\\", exiled to earth only 500 years ago as punishment for their failed attempt to oust the planet's cruel leader) or turn them into heroes (against a wicked sorcerer played by Mario Van Peebles in \\"Highlander 3\\"). There is no overt good or bad to the immortals other than a magnified and more long-lived version of what everybody has. When Mcleod reunites with the Kurgan in an NYC Church (being holy ground, it's a neutral zone), the gathering starts less as one of mortal enemies than of old acquaintances - a couple of 500 year-old men shooting the breeze and comparing notes. The direction deftly understates the immortals' pain of watching loved ones grow old and die. With a great score built around the album \\"It's a Kind of Magic\\", \\"Highlander\\" almost becomes a perfect rock-fantasy-epic. With it's very 1987 attitude (\\"It's better to burn out than fade away\\") this movie is fixed in its time and yet as timeless as the immortals themselves.
B000059H98|2.0|....<br />As for the movie, it's fun, she's a cool frisky chic, she looks like Gwen Stefani with a tank. The comic was better, but the movie was funny, albeit very similiar to being a Girl Mad Max. Malcom McDowell, Ice-T, and Lori Petty are in it.<br />Two stars for the movie, could be higher if the DVD had more on it.
B00005JKQX|5.0|&amp;#65279;I love this movie.  I thought it was a wonderful story that did a wonderful job of showing things<BR>from John Nash's point of view.  There were just enough twists in the movie to keep it<BR>interesting.  This is not an uplifting movie.  My wife left thinking it was the most depressing<BR>movie she has ever seen, but a little while later she liked the movie also.  I really want to read the<BR>book now, even though I understand it is quite different.
078324228X|1.0|&quot;Hurricane&quot; the movie and Denzel Washington have a lot in common: they're both laughably overrated.  Don't believe the hype, this movie and its twisted-out-of-context storyline aren't nearly as poignant and thought-provoking as director Norman Jewison would like you to believe.  Go ahead and buy it if you want, but don't say I didn't try and warn you.
B00005QK3W|5.0|I think this is Paul Masterpiece.  All music is great and return Paul to the origin.  Excellent songwriter!  Best album.
0517122707|5.0|People from New Orleans who have read this farce either love it or hate it.  I think that those who hate it see themselves or a very close relative (Mom?) as one of the crude characters who amuse those of us who know people like those characters, but not closely.  We just see them on the streetcar or in the Winn Dixie making groceries.  All very amusing.<br />I have read this tale several times and I plan to read it many more.  D. H. Holmes is now a Canal Street hotel, but the clock is back (Meetcha under the clock at Holmses) and under it is a life-sized bronze Ignatius J. Reilly worthy of a pilgrimage to New Orleans.
B00005JKT8|5.0|Hugh Jackman,played the part of Royalty---with excellancy. I was glad to hear Hugh won the Golden Globe Award for his acting in this movie---he deserves it. I took my 3-teenagers to see it Christmas day, it is now the 28th of December (3-days later)and they woke up this morning still bragging about the movie. They have told there daddy &amp; friend's about a Hollywood made love story and no one is  naked in a bedroom,(No Sex Parents),and kissing was limited to the end.<BR>Our family heritage comes from both a Royal monarchy and a presidential family. Through the Royal monarchy 's same bloodline came...President Thomas Jefferson. We are relatives of Thomas Jefferson. After the event of Septemember 11th.my heart was broken beyond remedy,I had to watch two of the greatest nations this earth has; stand on edge--these nation's are your heritage,and mine,yet I felt like every war and deed my family ever fought for, was doomed on September 11th. Sometimes, time is the greatest healer of all.I want to persoally thank the producer's of this movie for doing a wonderful job in making this a good clean movie,it helped to make my family's Christmas memories better. &quot;Good Movies Make Good memories&quot;,and that's what I want for my family.
B000002LEE|5.0|simply the most important album I own.  though the songs are not as polished and complex as on the follow-up, Ritual de lo Habitual, Nothing's Shocking is a more primal and powerful piece of work.  Eric Avery and Stephen Perkins are a driving, thumping rhythm section, Dave Navarro's guitar work is alternately whiplash and tidal and always electrifying, and nobody can wail like the inimitable Perry Farrell.<br />&quot;Jane Says&quot; (track 9) was first recorded as a studio track on this album, but that song's enduring popularity has overshadowed the other, better songs that surround it.<br />&quot;Ted, Just Admit It&quot; (track 4) may be the most cataclysmic track here, a seven-minute epic that lends the album its title and a lot of its essential character.<br />&quot;Summertime Rolls&quot; (track 6) is a beautiful, hedonistic ode to summer bliss.<br />&quot;Mountain Song&quot; (track 7) is at the moment my favorite Jane's Addiction song -- thundering drums, cascading guitars, an unforgettable baseline, and Perry Farrell in peak wailing form.<br />this album, more than any other, illustrates to me how far popular music has fallen in recent years -- because nothing has come close to Nothing's Shocking.
B00005RDAF|3.0|\\"Britney: The Videos\\" is good, but there was so much that could have been added to make it better. They included the VMA 2001 performance which was just amazing, but I really think they should have added the famous 2000 VMA performance as well. There are only four videos here. Two from the new album \\"Britney\\" (by the way, the \\"Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" video included on here is different than the one seen on MTV) and Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know from her second album Oops!...I Did It Again. The behind the scenes is nothing really special. The one with the photo shoot is Britney just dancing to \\"Anticipating.\\" Of course any fan will be happy to own this, but it was rushed and there should have been more interviews, etc. If you're a Britney fan, get it, but if you're expecting a lot from this DVD, don't get it.
B000050XEI|1.0|This is a wonderful CD to own if you've recently lost your soul or are trying to keep interesting music from entering your ears.
B00005OM4N|5.0|When I first brought this album.....I couldn't believe this was Britney! I absolutely thought it was horrible! But then I listened to it again and again. And I realized this may be her best album yet. I guess its an album that has to grow on you. <br />1. I'm A Slave 4 U- Not the best song on the album, but still one of my favorites. Very good to dance to. 8/10<br />2. Overprotected- I just love this song. It is very catchy. I keep singing it!  9/10<br />3. Lonely- Okay, this is my favorite song. Britney's voice is so deep when she is singing the vocal it is so cool.  9/10<br />4. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman- Now maybe if this song was featured on the &quot;Crossroads&quot; soundtrack, I would probably like it better. It just doesn't fit on this album.  3/10<br />5. Boys- This song sounds a lot like &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;. I don't really listen to it much, though. The beat is good but the lyrics just don't work with me.  5/10<br />6. Anticipating- Has Britney been watching &quot;That 70s Show&quot;? This song does not belong on this album. It may be real catchy, but I usually skip it.  4/10<br />7. I Love Rock 'n' Roll- This is a song I could get use to, I just haven't yet. I don't skip it because I like the <BR>chorus.  7/10<br />8. Cinderella- This is one of my favorites. I like the &quot;Cinderella's Got To Go&quot; line. Great new beat.  9/10<br />9. Let Me Be- I'm not really sure about this song. It's not one that I'd really listen to all the way through but I like. Weird, huh?  6/10<br />10. Bombastic Love- I hate the chorus. The vocals are okay though. 4/10<br />11. That's Where You Take Me- I like Britney's voice on this song. The beat sounds like a christmas song though. 8/10<br />12. What It's Like To Be Me- I like this song. Great beat. 9/10<br />So none of the songs got a 10/10.....but there was always something missing from all of the 9/10 ones. But - out of the above - the whole album rating would be 5 stars or 10/10. Britney Spears is the true pop princess and is next in line for Madonna's throne (Not that I ever thought Madonna had the throne).
B00005RYKU|1.0|At a glance, this film would appear to have a nice Hitchcockian plot, filled with suspense and doubt. However, even the intial setup winds up being clunky and nonsensical, while the rest of the film see-saws between laughably ridiculous and painfully dull. Though Leelee Sobieski, Stellan Skaarsgard, and Diane Lane all have given wonderful performances in other films, each of them falls flat in this one, which is to be expected, given how little they had to work with by way of plot and direction.  Seek out their other works, and avoid &quot;The Glass House&quot; like the plague.
B00005R62K|3.0|This album is classic, mainly if you measure it against today's low quality bands. But I cannot rate it five stars because this is a remaster with bonus tracks. If it was simply a remaster with only the original songs, it would deserve a better rating. But the trouble with this Remasters series of Judas Priest albums is indeed the quality of the bonus tracks!!!!! They are simply awful!! In STAINED CLASS, Priest added a monstruosity called THE FIRE BURNS BELOW, a freak with programmed drumming and cheesy lyrics, almost unbeliavable!!! Other than this, the live version of one of the songs already included in the album..big deal...The positive point is the booklet with lyrics, because band comments are also weak and terribly short.
B00003CXRM|5.0|The Coen brothers strike again! This wonderfully refreshing movie rates high on my list of favorites. It's an off-beat comedy filled with intelligent humor, gifted actors, and flavorful cinematography. The characters played by Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro provide wonderful contrast to the perfectly-cast George Clooney as the know-it-all petty criminal. I laughed from beginning to end!
B000002OX7|4.0|THe WHO has 3 great records: Tommy, Quadrophenia and WHO's NEXT. he latter is, by far, the best of them. A real classic.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Is there nothing this actor cannot do?  Is there a character he cannot play?  He runs the gamut with this one.  This film has it's moments of over simplifification and melodrama (but I suppose that is to be expected to show nearly 50 years of a man's life in 2 hours), however you can't help but get caught up in Crowe's performance and a glimpse into what John Nash's life must have been like -- not to mention the life of Alicia.  Ron Howard did a smart job of letting us view this through Nash's eyes.  The supporting cast was superb - Jennifer Connelly was lovely and totally at ease with this role.  Ed Harris and Christopher Plumber, always fabulous.  But it is Russell Crowe who keeps you glued to the screen.  You leave the theatre drained and aching to know more about the amazing, tortured, blessed life of John F. Nash, Jr.  Don't miss it!
B00005B36H|4.0|Short and Simple:  One of the best new CDs i've heard in ages.  I'm not into any of the 'current' metal/rock music.  I tend to just stick with my trusty Rollins, NIN and Pumpkins CDs for visceral artistic value, or Metallica when I just want lead-veined thrash.  I took a leap on this album and was pleasantly surprised.  Favorite Tracks: The Grudge, Parabol/Parabola, Lateralus.  I really like the lyrics and sound to these songs.  The whole CD is outstanding, really.  Only track I don't care much for is the last one (which doesn't actually qualify as a song anyhow), which is a little too pretentious and silly even for art-metal, but even it is tolerable.  To sum it up... if you're looking for mindless pop metal, this ain't it.  If you're looking something vaguely spiritual, meaningful, artistic and yet still heavy and uncompromising... I highly recommend this.
B000002LND|5.0|A wonderful collection of her best work in the first half of her career! Great job in picking the songs that made the album. Some of the songs are shorted a little too much, but oh well. It includes an amazing remix of Like A Prayer (which is my fave Madonna song) that is even better than the original. It also includes two new songs:Justify My Love and Rescue Me. (Well, they were new at the time.) like every hits collection should.
B000002LND|3.0|Though Jusify My Love, Vouge, and Resue Me, make it all worth the [the money]...but please note that every other track on here is the CUT RADIO VERSION** I assure you the album songs are much much better. Alot of the tracks have anywhere from 30 seconds to little over a MINUTE cut out, which had too be done too keep it from becoming a over-priced 2-disc set. Still alot of the songs...like, \\"Like A Prayer\\" arent the same verison as the one heard in the video (though its just as good) the album verison is better.
B00005Q66T|4.0|This is a pretty good collection of the second half of the greatest diva of all time's greatest hits. But there are 3 small problems with it.<BR>1. What's up with the censored version of Human Nature? I want the cuss words!<BR>2. It leaves out some of her best ballads like Rain and I'll Remember. But I'll excuse those because they were on Something To Remember. But I really think You Must Love Me should have been included on this.<BR>3. No new songs like The Immaculate Collection had. <BR>Overall, I still think this album is great. And I don't even mind all the  radio edits like I thought I would. And anyone who thinks that she made all her best music in the 80's and her 90's and 2000 songs weren't as good, will surely be proven wrong when they listen to this collection of masterpieces.
B00005QDW5|2.0|When I got this CD, I expected the best of albums such as Dark side of the Moon, Wish you were here, the wall, etc... Instead I got a FEW song I liked and knew, and the rest was old ... album filler. I am still a huge pink floyd fan, but this so called best his album is the worst best hits album ever.
B00004X01U|5.0|This album does a great job of mixing techno, pop and even country. <BR>Music: a wonderful song, really makes you wanna get up and dance<BR>Impressive Instant: this uses some computerized vocals, it's a good song and it's kinda funny too<BR>Runaway Lover: If a had to pick a least fave, it would be this one. It's still a good song, just not as interesting as the others.<BR>I Deserve It: A nice love song mixing techno with a little country<BR>Amazing: Good song, but it kinda sounds a little too much like Beautiful Stranger.<BR>Nobody's Perfect: A great song about a girl who's cheating on her man because's he's away too long.<BR>Don't Tell Me: At first I wasn't very impressed with this one, but it grew on me. Now I love it and I'm glad it was a single.<BR>What It Feels Like For A Girl: Great girl power song; my favorite on this CD.<BR>Paradise (Not For Me): This was my original least fave off this album. It had to grow on me too, and now I think it's cool.<BR>Gone: The only actual ballad on the album; this one is short, but sweet. One of the best songs on the album.
0856610798|5.0|After years of having one of the world's worst bird books, East Africa now has two of the best. The Zimmerman/Turner book on Kenya and Northern Tanzania, the work of 30 years, set a new standard of scholarship and illustration. This book draws on that one, but is even better for the tourist and field birder. It covers all of Uganda and Tanzania, as well as Rwanda and Burundi. It is smaller and lighter to carry. And the illustrations and their placement in related groups on the same page are simply outstanding. This is one of the best bird books in the world and will dominate the market for years to come.
B000002LGQ|5.0|This is Madonna's most personal and in my opinion her greatest album.<BR>Like A Prayer: This is my absolute fave Madonna song. Why? I don't really know. It's a love song that sounds gospel and it's got a choir. I just enjoy listening to this one.<BR>Express Youself: another fave Madonna track. It's got a really great beat and a good message too.<BR>Love Song: This is a duet with Prince. Who cares what the song sounds like? Just the fact that it's the two of them singing together makes this one a masterpiece.<BR>Till Death Do Us Part: wonderful song about a broken up marriage. I think this one was about Sean Penn even though I think she denied that.<BR>Promise To Try: My interpretation of this song is that it's the adult Madonna talking to the child Madonna about dealing with her mother's death. I can't listen to this without crying. It makes me think of my Grandma.<BR>Cherish: really great happy feal-good love song.<BR>Dear Jessie: this is a really nice sweet song, but it is my least fave off this album<BR>Oh Father: This one's a masterpiece. I think the lyrics really do represent the way abused children feel. She sings this one with great feeling and passion.<BR>Keep It Together: ...This is a great song telling us how important your family is.<BR>Spanish Eyes: This one is a beautiful Latin sounding ballad. I think it's the story of a girl whose Spanish boyfriend dies in a war. A touching song that's also sung with passion. <BR>Act Of Contrition: This is the only Madonna interlude ever. It's kinda funny.
B00003CXTF|2.0|This movie should have been entitled &quot;Have you had enough yet?&quot;. The character buildup in this one was OUTRAGEOUS..and led you nowhere. I bought this movie for Historical ACTION.. and instead got, well.. ROMANCE. The main theme (I should say DRAG) of this flick was not the attack on Pearl Harbor, but rather the ridiculously predictable love triangle of two pilots and a nurse.<BR> While slightly entertaining, if only to see Benny go down in flames, I wouldn't have paid full price if I'd known the full gist of romantic lunacy this one offered up in huge steaming piles. <BR> If your into a long drawn out plot (if it can be called that) and very little else, get this, you'll love it, Otherwise move on with no regrets or just watch tape 2.
B000002N3J|5.0|I love Madonna and I love ballads. So to me, this album was perfect. Well, almost perfect. It has most of her greatest ballads up to 1995 including I'll Remember and This Used To Be Playground which aren't available on any Madonna album. The new songs are great. I Want You is a good cover of a Marvin Gaye song. You'll See is a powerful sequel to Take A Bow and One More Chance is a beautiful acoustic piece. I guess they only problem is that I felt there were some great ballads that were left out such as In This Life and Promise To Try. Now I know these songs weren't singles, but neither was Forbidden Love and that one made the album. But I guess it's impossible to include everything. Overall, I think this is a wonderful collection and definitely a must have for every Madonna fan.
B00005A46T|5.0|The intensity of Corey's lyrics and provocative usage of them is indescribable. Anyone who can convey so much emotion into a song has my vote. right form the beginning you know Slipknot means business with this hard hitting assault on the eardrums that takes you to another realm. The drums are kicking, the guitars are pounding, the samples are fierce, and the band as a whole takes metal to another level. When you listen to this album you get a perspective that is neither ugly or beautiful it just is. I bought this on a whim after not purchasing their first CD and it hit me with credulity, intensity, and pure raw emotion. What the music lacks the awesome introspective lyrics make up for and vice versa. I can't see this album deserving less then three stars just for the fact that it is so intense, almost like a Pantera on speed. This, in my humble opinion is the must have album of the year. Now to the dreaded complaints on the album. I would have liked to hear some more guitar work. A guitar solo or at least a squeal wouldn't have hurt at some point during this album. After listening to the first album I would definitely have liked to hear a little more from the sampler and DJ which almost seemed nonexistent on this album compared to the first were they topped off every song with sounds that seemed to complete the song. Altogether this album rocked and the band made true to their promise to make a heavier more intense album. This album is just different from their first not necessarily better or worse. Slipknot fans in general should be able to like both aspects and new listeners should be able to pick up the sickness along with the already infected by listening to this album!
B000002MUW|4.0|This is Madonna's most R&amp;B sounding album. And she does a great job at it. For some reason, I love to listen to it the dark.<BR>Survial: nice song about how she's 'survived' in the music business<BR>Secret: Amazing song! I love the low parts in this song. When I first heard this song on the radio, I was so happy to hear someone who wasn't telling me I had to be a soprano to have a great voice.<BR>I'd Rather Be Your Lover: my least fave on this album; it's alright.<BR>Don't Stop: the dance song; you can't have a Madonna album without one<BR>Inside Of Me: touching song that she wrote about her mother<BR>Human Nature: This is one of my fave Madonna songs; I love how she says that she's doesn't have to apoligize for anything she's done in her music career.<BR>Forbidden Love: nice ballad co-written by Babyface<BR>Love Tried To Welcome Me: wonderful dark ballad about a girl who can't fall in love<BR>Sanctuary: Another love song; this is about the time that I wanna turn the lights off.<BR>Bedtime Story: this is one those that you love because it's weird; it's a great song<BR>Take A Bow: What can I say about this one? One of her greatest ballads of all time. It's beautiful; she sings great too.
B00000JSJC|4.0|Kind of a plot rehash in parts - ex-cop turned crook, but still a good guy at heart.  Lots of great clothes on the chicks, kindy of kinky in parts. It's `Brainwave`+`Out for Justice` with a little `Bladerunner` tossed in. Strictly B-list actors, but this movie was made for eye-candy, not oscars. It's one of those that grows on ya', so if you like action, cyberpunkish techno, and see-thru tops, pick it up.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is Madonna's second best album in my opionion. It's a real masterpiece.<BR>Drowned World/Substitute For Love: lovely song about she used to think her fame and career were the most important things and she substitued that for real love, but she's changed her mind.<BR>Swim: This song had to grow on me. Not of the best on the album, but still good.<BR>Ray Of Light: great dance track; this song has some of the highest vocals she's ever sung.<BR>Candy Perfume Girl: This one grew on me. Now I love it; great job mixing techo and rock.<BR>Skin: this one is kind strange, but I love it.<BR>Nothing Really Matters: This song is the complete oppisite of Material Girl. <BR>Sky Fits Heaven: This a great song and I wish it could have been a single.<BR>Shanti/Ashtangi: The language is this song is Hebrew. It's sorta weird, but I still think it's a great song.<BR>Frozen: This is one of my fave Madonna songs. I like that it's a dark song, but it's also about love. This song is a masterpiece.<BR>The Power Of Good-Bye: Great ballad. I just love listening to it.<BR>To Have And Not To Hold: Another great ballad, but not as good as The Power Of Good-Bye<BR>Little Star: I just love it when singers when songs about their children. And this one is one of the best. It's very touching and heartfelt.<BR>Mer Girl: This one's really slow, but it's still good. It's kinda sad too.
B00000634J|4.0|I'd like to start with a very pretentious statement: John Lennon is the greatest musical genius of the last half century.<br />That said... is another compilation really necessary? I rarely recommend compilations as an introduction to an artist, and John is one of those musicians who worked much better when not recording a single. Granted, the songs on this CD are for the most part excellent, but if you think all there is to John Lennon's solo music is soft pop ballads like Imagine, Woman and Jealous Guy then you're dead wrong. I know many Beatles fans get Lennon and McCartney compilations instead of their albums, and those don't give you much of an idea on the range of those to geniuses' solo music. John made some hard rock during the 70s, and except for the excellent 'Cold Turkey' there is no sign of that here.<br />And anyway, was there any point in releasing this CD, seventeen years after the release of the John Lennon Collection? The Collection had nineteen tracks, the Legend has twenty. Seventeen of them are identical. What's the big idea in squeezing some more money out of fans on this repeat? The remastering doesn't really make that much of a difference. I can't imagine why anyone would want to own both CDs, but I'm sure that some people do. True, this new compilation is an improvement over the Collection; the awful 'Dear Yoko' was excluded, and instead songs were brought in from John's two most underrated albums. From his debut album, 'Plastic Ono Band', which is doubtlessly his best, and which was neglected in the Collection, two excellent songs were included: 'Mother', and the wonderful, underrated masterpiece 'Working Class Hero'. From 'Rock n' Roll', a cover-only album which is usually left out when recalling John's career, was included his excellent version of the classic 'Stand By Me'.<br />The big advantage of a Lennon compilation is that you don't have to buy 'Sometime In New York' and 'Double Fantsy', both of which Yoko Ono had far two much to do with. It's quite sensible to keep lovely Lennon songs like '(Just Like) Starting Over', 'Beautiful Boy' and 'Watching The Wheels' and skip Yoko's half of 'Double Fatntasy' - although it's a shame John's 'I'm Losing You' isn't here. However, if you're a true Lennon/Beatles fan, his first two albums, 'Plastic Ono Band' and 'Imagine' should not by missed! If you really only want a Lennon compilation that will include Imagine and Woman, get the Legend as it's the best one yet (and I have a bad feeling more compilations would eventually be made.)
B000001ESP|5.0|With over 100 reviews, there might not be more to say.  This is Rush at the height of their power, IMO.  Witch Hunt is a bit of a drag, and Vital Signs is merely a good song.  The rest is sheer mastery of the art.  They had some excellent material before and since, and they also had some bad material before and especially since, but their &quot;stock&quot; peaked at this point.  I recall even Alex Lifeson commenting that he would not attempt such complicated rhythms and chord progressions anymore.  I can add one original comment - this particular version of this recording is probably the best you can find - it sounds better than the original, and even better than the Mobile Fidelity &quot;Original Master&quot; gold disc, IMO, at half the price!
B000002J0B|4.0|Of all the albums made by Led Zeppelin, this one has got to be the most ambitious and therefore intriging. Fans who expected the band to continue cranking out the exciting hard-rocking jams they have already grown accustomed to by the time this album came out must've been scratching their heads in wonder for the most part. I, on the other hand, found Houses of the Holy to be yet another musical gem in the Led Zeppelin canon. The one thing about this album that really makes it stand out from the pack is the diversity contained within. <br />The first song &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot;, is largely a rock-based instrumental save for some drippy lyrics sung by Plant. Drummer Bonham and guitarist Page really heat things up on this track. <br />&quot;The Rain Song&quot; is a long, sweeping ballad that highlights a side of the band that many probably weren't too aware of. John Paul Jones definitely steals the show doing double duty on bass and mellotron. An underrated piece of work.<br />&quot;Over The Hills and Far Away&quot; is one of those classic Led Zeppelin tunes in the sense that it deftly combines their signature hard-rock sound with folkish, acoustic touches. Only takes one listen to get you hooked.<br />&quot;The Crunge&quot; sounds like a comical yet funky ode to James Brown, especially with Plant wondering where the &quot;bridge&quot; could be by the song's end, lol. Bonham's drumming on this track is right on. It's obvious to me that funk is no stranger to his bombastic style of playing, which in turn is an integral part of the band's unique sound as a whole. <br />When I first heard &quot;Dancing Days&quot;, I knew from that moment on that Lenny Kravitz was a total joke. It's quite clear to me that he probably heard this song more than once or twice and had an &quot;idea&quot; for a song of his own (I'm not going to say which one, but some of you might already know the one I mean,&quot;DIG&quot;!?!). That aside, this is a fun track that doesn't disappoint at any house party.<br />Now &quot;D'yer Mak'er&quot; is so cheesy in it's lyrics and reggae-styled arrangement that I couldn't help but fall in love with it. How could anybody have a bad day and NOT get over it after hearing this unexpected ditty from a band not generally known for such songs!?!?!?<br />&quot;No Quarter&quot; is one of the most creative tunes that the band has ever done. Upon first listen, the moody synthesizers of John Paul Jones along with Plant's processed vocals had me almost thinking it was a Pink Floyd track! Add to that the properly understated guitar work of Page and you truly have a songwriting masterpiece that sounds more contemporary than any Led Zeppelin track by far.<br />Finally, &quot;The Ocean&quot; brings fans back to more familiar territory with the hard-rockin, highly rhythmic jamming of the band. However, the song winds up doing a complete 180 with an a capella twist and a doo-wop-styled finish thrown in for good measure.<br />Overall, Houses of the Holy is an album that is so unlike previous efforts with its wide musical palette that it may turn off some listeners at first, the sole reason why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5. But for those fans who are hardcore to the very end or those who just have an open mind for music, this album is among the finest and most rewarding of the Led Zeppelin catalog.
B00005QW4K|3.0|This version of Army of Darkness isn't terrible, but if you're not a fan of bootlegs, you probably won't like it.  The video quality really drops off in points, and the re-editing is very strange.  The entire flow of the movie is changed, for better or worse.  Some of the extra scenes are exclusive to this disk, and some of the extra scenes in other disks didn't quite make it here.  To put it bluntly, this really is a bootleg, with all the pros and cons that that term entails, but for some reason it has been given distribution rights.  It may only appeal to the hardcore fans.
B00003CXCK|5.0|I was  13   when i saw  shindler's  list. i saw  in pbs   with no  editing  and   non  commerical. It was  the most compelling   movie  i have  ever  seen in my  life.  I've  been  searching  for  this  movie  for like  3 months  trying to  get it but  i couldnt  find it. Now that  i have   a dvd  player.  i want  shindlers list  to be a Dvd. That  would be the  most  compelling  dvd  movie  ever made. i want to  see  how  they  made  it. I hope  everyone  votes  for this  movie  to be  realeased for dvd   so i can  get as soon  as it comes  out.  I love drama  and military   movies  and i want to add  this one  for  my  collection  so  i can  teach  this  to my children  and  to never  forget  that  awful   period  of  time in history. ...  Keep  the spirit alive.
B00004Z459|4.0|I'm mainly a rap fan, but I think this album is off the hook.  My friend was playing it, and although some songs had to grow on me, I'd say about half of the CD is great.  The best tracks are: &quot;One Step Closer,&quot; &quot;Crawling,&quot; &quot;Runaway,&quot; &quot;By Myself,&quot; &quot;In the End,&quot; &quot;Forgotten*,&quot; and Track 9.  If you like rock, or rock-rap this should appeal to you.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I find it amusing that so many people are only rating and reviewing the film &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; here.  This is a film where there is little room for shades of gray - you either love it or hate it.   If you did not see this film in the theaters, by all means go to you local rental store and take the DVD home for a night or two before buying it here on Amazon.  If your brain warps or your eyes roll back into your head or you are beset with moans or giggles, be thankful that you only spent a couple of dollars on the rental and proceed on with your life (don't worry I hear the recovery time is relatively short).  If this is not the case, by all means, buy this DVD and immerse yourself in the lavish treatment the film receives in this 2-disc set.<br />Director Baz Luhrmann has simply created one of the most impressive DVD packages on the market today.  There are so many extras (deleted scenes, extended dance sequences, music videos, hundreds of still photos) that it would be difficult to list them all out without exceeding the 1000-word limit for reviews.  Although the DVD contains two separate audio commentary tracks, one small quibble is that neither contains any from the actors.  Nevertheless, it is a disc that you will pop into the DVD player time and time again.  This is the reason to buy any DVD in the first place, right?   If all these features are possibly not enough, fifteen &quot;easter eggs&quot; are hidden on Disc 2 with more brief behind-the-scenes snippets.  Is this all excessive?  Sure!  But would we expect anything less from Luhrmann who already showed us how over-the-top he likes to go with his previous film &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;?   But there is no denying his passion and this DVD is certainly a love letter to the filmmaking process.  The &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; DVD is exhaustive -- but just may leave you wonderfully breathless!
B000009QPE|5.0|This is the best heavy metal album ever made.
B000005H55|4.0|Have you ever owned an album, or book, or...anything, and liked it, then read a negative review of the work, and then liked it less because of that??? I hope that you haven't! <br />We all are gifted with our own ears and eyes and have different ways of using and experiencing through them. If you want to know how I would critique this album then I would tell you to listen to the clips above or check out a copy from your library (it's cool that you can do that now in some areas.) Telling other people why you didn't like about this album does NOT change what the musician played, and vice versa. This album may have been different from the popular music of jazz at the time, but wait: when free and avant-garde jazz is the most prolific style, swing and bop will be new, radical and noisy. <br />Please give everything a listen or two. If you like it, cool. If you don't like it, cool. Incidentally, I gave this album 4 stars because I wanted to write this review (,of sorts) but not effect the overall rating of the album too much.
0316286443|5.0|If only I could get him to do my makeup!<br />Kevyn Aucoin once again proves himself. Not only are his makeovers phenomenal, his accompanying writings are fascinating. This is a man with an appreciation for the beauty of women - women of all shapes and sizes. His subjects are not always supermodels. Next to pictures of Christy Turlington and Gwenyth Paltrow are pictures of everday women - women of age, color, and size.<br />Some of the pictures do look a little airbrushed - but the effect is still phenomenal. You will not believe your eyes - this man can work magic.<br />Women looking to learn how to apply makeup should buy Kevyn's book, &quot;Making Faces&quot; before this one. This is a more advanced book, discussing facial shapes in depth and requiring a greater knowledge of products and colors.<br />Women with an appreciation for cinema of the 30s, classic fashion designers will love Kevyn's transformations. The most entertaining part of the book is the last few pages, where Kevyn experiments with eggplant-black foundation, glitter lipgloss, blue lipstick and crimson eyeshadow. <br />This book will make you feel beautiful by just sitting and reading it. Kevyn is my hero!
B00004U8JV|4.0|THE LOST WORLD is the sequel to the box office hit, JURASSIC PARK. It's been four years since dinosaurs broke loose and created a disaster in Jurassic Park, and now it's discovered that there is a island where the dinosaurs were genetically created and then shipped to Jurassic Park. There is one group of people who are sent to the island in order to document the dinosaurs and how they live in their own enviornment, and there is also another group of people who are going to the island because they plan on taking the dinosaurs back to America to be displayed in a theme park.
B000006E17|4.0|I first stumbled across this movie in the &quot;cult&quot; section of my local video store and was immediately intrigued.  I had hear of de Sade, and was interested to see how his work would be interpreted here.<br />James Baldwin once said, and I'm paraphrasing here, that the job of the artist is to hold a mirror up to society, so that we may see ourselves whether we like all that we see or not.  And of course, is we don't like what we see, then it is the artist who must be punished for showing it to us in the first place.  That appears to be what happened in Passolini's case.<br />This film is bound to get a reatsion, whether fascination or revulsion, but it doesn't reveal anything of which we shouldn't already be aware.  However much we want to turn away from the reflection, we cannot - whether out of disbelief or a wonder at just where and when it will all end.  In the end, what seemed to have started out as game of indulgence ends in wordless brutality that remains in one's mind long after the images have faded from the screen.  And while the scenes of rape and mutilation are shocking, they are not at all surprising.  How else did we think it would all end?<br />What people may find most disturbing is that Passolini simply ends the story without offering any hope of redemption, a reprieve or a way out for either his audience or his characters.  Instead, he leaves us with a blank screen, and an unspoken knowledge that how it ends - how man's inhumanity to man ends, how the indulgence of our own desires at the expense of others ends, how abusing power without concern for how it effect others ends - rests in our own hands and how we conduct outselves.  Knowing, and having been shown by Passolini, just what we are capable of, being left with that responsibility is many times more horrible than any image Passolini has shown us through our own reflection.
B00004U8JU|5.0|JURASSIC PARK is a film about a millionare who builds a large theme park on a Costa Rica island, and populates it with genetically-created dinosaurs. The millionare invites a paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a mathematician, and his two grandchildren to experience the park. Soon, a storm sweeps over the island and all the electric power in the park shuts off, and the dinosaurs are able to break out of their cages and terrorize the visitors.
B000050XEI|5.0|I own all of Enya's albums and this is probably the best one.  While I know some people who think &quot;Only Time&quot; is overplayed on the radio (I know the remix is) the original on the CD is wonderful as are the rest of the songs on the CD. A great listen for relaxing
6304806442|5.0|When I first started watching this movie one night on the Independent Film Channel, I had already missed half of it.  No matter!!!  Even half of this film is as great as the whole!  Finally, when it came out on DVD, I was happy to watch it in full.......so many times I lost count.<br />The film is about heroin addicts that try to deal with their heroin addiction and &quot;choosing life&quot;.  The main character, Mark Renton, played by Ewan McGregor, who later starred in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, tries to resolve the pros and cons of heroin addiction and &quot;leading a useful and fullfilling life as a good citizen&quot;.  While off heroin, Renton's eyes are no longer obscured from the heroin and can discern the harse realities of society, and even finding an overwhelming urge for sex, of which heroin used to block out.  Unfortunately, life isn't all that one could hope, and Renton and his friends &quot;make a democratic decision&quot; to relapse.  After an overdose of heroin and &quot;jellies&quot;, Renton is taken to hospital and later under house arrest, strictly enforced by his parents, until he withdraws from his heroin addiction.  Amazed how wonderful life is without his friends, Renton realizes choosing life is best.  But his friends won't go away.  They require Renton to help with a &quot;scag deal&quot;.  End the end, Renton reaps the rewards.<br />The movie is quite humurous with well expressed quips and twists.  McGreogor's character, Renton, initially mocks the purpose of living a &quot;useful&quot; life, however, realizes &quot;choosing life&quot; is the answer.<br />So......&quot;Choose life&quot;.  Buy this movie!!!<br />May not be suitable to anyone under 17.  Recommend adult supervision.  Contains some nudity and harse realities.
B00005QW5X|5.0|What a great movie. Really fun and what an AMAZING soundtrack reminiscent of old Bowie, Bauhaus etc. A must see/have! Definitely a must have soundtrack. What great song writting ability.
B00005A46T|5.0|When I listened to Slipknot's first release I was drawn in by the excellent musical assault, but totally turned off by the amatuer lyrics. The old album sounded like Corey throwing a tantrum while the other guys poured their bowels out trying to make some quality metal. <BR>Well, things have changed.<BR>Slipknot have unleashed upon the world the heaviest, darkest most beautifully ugly record this year. Corey's lyrics are absolutely top notch and they reflect on themes of commerciality, misanthropia, violence, madness, apocalypse etc, but this time they do it intelligently!<BR>The music is absolutely brutal (though I have heard more abrasive, but why carp). The band has not lost their sense of melody or adventure and they invest their crunching riffs and percussion with industrial noise and clearly sung vocals. <BR>I admit it to the disdain of all of my hardcore and metal friends, this album has made me a maggot! All hail Slipknot!

B00005QK3W|4.0|This, McCartney's latest album, has certainly shown me that his talent isn't getting in the least bit rusty. Though not quite as well crafted as 'Flaming Pie', I think that this is a true McCartney masterpiece. Although some of the songs are similar in their style and direction, there are some real gems on this album. 'Your loving flame' and 'Spinning on an Axis' stood out to me especially. This has a new feeling for McCatney, maybe the beginning of something new, but judging by the way he moved on from Flaming Pie to Run Devil Run, to his Orchestral work, to this, there's no telling. Whatever he does he seems to carry off with style, and so I hope that it is not as long a wait before the next McCartney masterpiece.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira continues with her succcesfull career, giving us the opportunity to admire her music.<BR>She is the BEST pop singer in the world.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I don't like war.  I don't like war movies.  When it came out in theaters I had no interest in seeing this movie.  But this isn't your average film about the glorious and indomitable USA.  Instead it is a beautifully filmed story about the American spirit, courage, love, and friendship.  The characters are superbly developed, humor is expertly interwoven with tragedy, and the realistic scenes of death and destruction leave you with a horrific sense of patriotism.  Whether you watch it for its component of romance, action, or history, it is sure to please.
B00004YYDI|5.0|I don't know how to put in words how amazing this film really is.  It combines the talents of the one and only Gary Oldman with the great french actor Jean Reno. Their characters in the film suit them perfectly making it intense, gripping and exciting all at the same time. The first time you see this film you will have no idea where it is going, which will leave you glued to your seat throughout (and probably after!) the film.<BR>Luc Besson directs a truely magnificent storyline and leaves <BR>no room for error. I personaly HATE BJORK, and cannot stand her singing but a couple of her tracks are lightly blended into this film and and I cannot fault this in any way. The songs change the image of this film from being a part action film, to a sort of art-house novel.<br />I have brought the American un-cut DVD and think it's brilliant, with the extra 25 minutes footage that adds more light to the storyline.<br />I demand you to watch this film. This is what  has turned me into a film-fanatic, let it do the same to you.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|This is no doubt the most extensive DVD I've ever encountered.  <br />First, the film quality is excellent.  I was expecting a grainy picture, but the picture quality is fantastic for such an old movie.  <br />Then there's all the extras!  Wow!!  You could spend a full day just checking out disk 2!  Disk 1 also has its fair share of extras.  One of the extras is Dopey's Wild Ride.  It's an interactive triva game, and the questions are quite hard (one requires you to match the dwarf to his musical instrument!).  This is definitely one of the better games I've seen on DVDs (much better than the games on Shrek).  Disk 2 is full of features such as deleted scenes and old trailers for the movie.  Also included on disk 2 is a comparison of the storyboard to the actual movie.  This is a pretty neat feature because you can use the angle button to toggle between the different scenes.<br />I was surprised to see how dramatic this movie is.   If you have young children, be sure to watch it with them the first time they view the movie.  When I was 4, the Snow White ride was the only ride that scared me at Disney World, and I think the movie could do the same to young children!
B00005QGAX|5.0|Last Saturday(Before Christmas), I've brought this newly state of the art updated version of &quot;Bad&quot;, and I got to tell you that MJ and Bruce Swedien has now done a excellent AAA standard job and remastered this #1 favorite album of mine(since 1987/88) with JUSTICE!  This is the same album that got me into music in general and helped me get through elementary school when times were rough for me, and now it's even better with new cardboard boxart, a new book containing new concert photos and other pictures, newly remastered tracks(Speed Demon's more cooler than ever now!) and new interviews by beloved music legend, Quincy Jones! But The REAL highlight of this enhanced version is the bonus tracks &quot;Streetwalker&quot;(The Best!!), The Spanish Version of &quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot;(BEAUTIFUL!!!) and &quot;Fly Away&quot;(Very Good!), all of which should have been in the original album.  This product is now the best example of how a remastered album SHOULD be done and one that Proud MJ fans(including me) should never miss.  Great Job, Michael Jackson!
B00005JKQX|5.0|This film is by no means flawless; however, it is thoroughly enjoyable and through the story of Nash develops the worthier story of humanity at its best.  Without giving too much away, the film is based on the novel by Nasar and depicts the life of John Nash a 1994 Nobel Prize winner in economics for his work on game theory, a new science that developed out of the optimism of the US victory in WWII and the mathematical advancements that helped in the victory from code breaking to the development of the atomic bomb.  I would have liked, in fact, to see more about the science, but the movie is not about science.  It';s really about his struggle to cope with schizofrenia and his wife's subsequent and even more moving struggle and courage to cope with her 'disabled' genious husband's disorder.  How easy it would have been for her to marry one of the other fine and handsome graduates of Princeton.  In typical Howard fashion, the movie has a definite feel good emotional ending but it's appropriate and after all Nash is still alive and teaching. I could not avoid comparing this film with Shine, another story of a genius that has to fight an emotional disorder after initial success and finds redemption after a long struggle against himself.  The flaws are minor and do not detract from the enjoyment of the film. I was curious to find out, for instance, how Nash' own family and his wife's family reacted to the disorder and his debilitation.  It's hinted that his wife felt some pressure to leave the husband but the subject is not explored.  No matter, the movie's integrity survives nonetheless. Russell Crowe is remarkable and delivers some hilarious dry lines amidst the serousness.  Connelly is as beautiful as ever and shows a serious side I had not suspected. These performances should guarantee at least a couple of Oscar nominations.
0517201658|5.0|Like so many other girls of my era, I picked up the name Megan after my mother saw the mini-series in the 80s and absolutely fell in love with the characters. I'd always been intrigued with the story of how my mama's little girl got her name from a MOVIE, of all things, so when I &quot;was old enough&quot; to investigate for myself, I picked up the book (no easy feat, at over 700 pages!) and started reading this past summer. I just finished a few weeks ago and all I can say is WOW!<br />It's not an uplifting tale, but I was more than content with that -- life is not always uplifting. It was an intricate, stunning story of the three generations of the same family, focusing on Meggie Cleary (my name sake) and her forbidden obsession with Father Ralph. At times throughout the novel, I simply had to sit back and say, &quot;Wow.&quot; No other words formed coherently in my brain. It is an epic of the truest sense... you'll cry, you'll gasp, you'll... cry some more. It's got everything you could really ask for -- action, adventure, romance... and more romance. <br />It leaves you strangely unfulfilled, however... Dane never learns the truth of about his father, and Meggie never lives happily ever after with Ralph. That's the most tragic part of all. But I cannot say that I didn't enjoy it... I'd be lying through my teeth. It was one of the most powerfully written stories I've ever had the privilege of reading, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to really sink their teeth into a good novel.
B000002A3T|5.0|I've heard many, many Floyd fans say that without Roger Waters the band has lost its soul. This is just not true. The Division Bell is, in my opinion, one of Pink Floyd's greatest works. It starts out with a quiet, yet strangely appealing song with Rick Wright on the keyboard and Dave Gilmour on the guitar(duh). The second song has a nice bass beat, and has pretty good lyrics, though I must admit that Waters is a better lyricist than Gilmour. But he is learning. The third song seems to be something of a tribute to Waters, and it has a strange carnival music interval in the middle of the song. The fourth song is one of my all time favorites. Marooned is an awesome, awesome, instrumental piece that won a grammy in '94. The fifth song is my least favorite on the cd, but I still think it's ok. Thr 6th song is very bland, but for some reason it was the first song on the cd I really got into. It features Rick Wright singing and actually has two sets of lyrics going at the same time(Wright and the backing vocals). The seventh song is my 2nd least favorite, I guess it's a little too predictable or poppy. The eight song starts out slow, with just Gilmour singing, and then a beat and guitar comes in. The ninth song is one of my favorites, it has, oddly enough, Stephen Hawking in it. It features a really cool beat and Gilmour singing somewhat monotonous lyrics. The 10th song is ok, but it's not a greatest hit. It has a lot of acoustic guitar in it. The last song is really good, but if you want to enjoy it for its full value, listen to it on Pulse.<BR>Overrall I think this album is very, VERY good, especially for Waters not being there. It's very mellow though, so if you only like the Floyd albums that are like DSOM then this probably isn't for you.<BR>One last thing, in the booklet there is a sillhouette of the heads on the album cover on each song, and there is a word written in each one in different languages. I don't know the significance of this, but it might have something to do with the way languages divide the planet.
0471413909|5.0|If you're new to the Paleo Diet concept, I suggest you pick up this book first.  It is a straight forward, easy to understand book that does a good job of showing that the Paleo diet is not a fad diet, but the politically correct diet of this age (high carb, low fat) IS.<BR>For those who are familiar with the Paleolithic style of eating, I might want to give it a star or two less.  Why?  Well, Dr. Cordain is THE leading expert in the anthropological aspect of the Paleo diet, and quite frankly I was expecting more in depth discussion, research...and a lot more numbers.  For the frustrated dieter who simply wants a diet THAT WORKS though, this is probably not a concern.
B000001FTS|5.0|You don't just hear this album.......You can see it too.Especially with your eyes closed. NO DRUGS REQUIRED !

B00005QZWJ|5.0|The Lord of the Rings is now a world wide phenomenon sweeping many parts of the world. Along with this movie is its spectacular soundtrack that captures the fantasy worlds of J.R.R. Tolkien. I listened to the soundtrack before watching the movie, but even so I could feel the world of J.R.R. Tolkien being converted into symphonic sounds in my brain. The soundtrack started with the track the Prophecy - mysterious and balanced light chorus lines that really brings the listener into the Middle Land and the world of the Hobbits, Elves and wizards. Other tracks like Concerning the Hobbits, May it be, the Breaking of the Fellowship, The Great River and the Ring Goes South are all very well fitted music for the story. If a good soundtrack is the one that can remind you of the scenes of the movie, then this one is the soundtrack that should fly in the sky, for this soundtrack can bring you even more into the wizardry world of Tolkien, disregard the presence of the movie. It can both compliment and enrich the movie AND at the same time stand alone as a guide to the musical world of Tolkien. You would enjoy it most when you are reading Tolkien and listening to this soundtrack together.
B000002UAI|4.0|This album was a very sad album, at a point where The Beatles were getting tired with Beatlemania.  &quot;No Reply,&quot; &quot;Baby's In Black,&quot; and &quot;I'm a Loser&quot; were all sad tracks, and The Beatles began to play differently because of it; it was the first time we had ever experienced a sad Beatles record.  Before I bought this one I dodn't even know there was such a thing.  Yet, somewhere through the dark mood of the album, we find the joy and high spirit of &quot;Eight Days A Week.&quot;  The Beatles were still playing good music, but the good music was beginning to change.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Very disapointed in this movie...if it weren't for the battle scenes I would have written it totally off! The love triangle was absolutely stupid as were all the women in it (retired female Marine here). My husband and kids (ages 14-18) also preferred the battle scenes and shared my opinions about the sappy love story! Too bad, I really looked forward to it.  &quot;Memphis Belle&quot; was much better.  Can't wait to see that on DVD!  Thanks....
B00005JKES|5.0|The reason the pilot isn't included is because Artisan doesn't own the pilot/first episode, Warner Brothers does. Maybe WB will get their act together now and release it. There is a Thai released DVD of the pilot available on Ebay.
B00005JKMO|3.0|Kudos for the attention to detail and the hard work Will Smith put into it, but the story just isn't that exciting.  It's hard to get excited about a self inflated, draft dodger, no matter how good a fighter he was.

0767816641|3.0|It is heartening to know that people are still making films of this type. This is in the style of Happiest Days Of Their Lives or the St.Trinians films, but with younger girls. It therefore ditches any sort of sexuality in favour of a rather charming innocence. Even the teacher is a nun, rather than an Alistair Sim type. Having said that, these girls are no Von-Trapp angels. Director Daisy Von Scherler Meyer avoids the pitfall of casting precocious showbiz children and choses (mainly) sweet little girls who can act. The main plot about the girls trying to keep their school from being sold by crusty old aristocrat Nigel Hawthorne is spiced up with a kidnap caper which stops things wearing thin. On the whole, a good one to watch with younger children.
B000002AZX|5.0|as long as he doesn't work with Phil Spector.<BR>Just another great one.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|When I saw the film on the 19th, I found myself in tears at the sheer beauty of the music. No one could have done a better job than Howard Shore and co. The simplistic enchantment of &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; reminds me of the happy, carefree nature of the Shire. The merry interactions between the violin and flute complete the sound. Continuing through &quot;At the Sign of the Prancing Pony&quot; with its dark chorus in Black Speech, the setting of impending darkness seeps through you eerily. &quot;The Council of Elrond&quot; tells of the story of Aragorn and Arwen, but more so it provides an interlude from the darkness, offering a ray of hope where there may have been none with the coming of the Fellowship.<BR>&quot;The Bridge of Khazad-Dm&quot; brings you into the depths of Moria, depicting the frantic chase of the Fellowship and the Balrog, ending with a heartbreaking melody displaying the despair and loss of the group. &quot;Lothlrien&quot; brings meaning to Legolas' words 'The grief is still too near.' in its forboding embodiment of a dark grief. &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot; is my favorite. It is all of FotR rolled into one song. Hope, loss, fear and a determination to go on as is sung by Edward Ross in the hymn &quot;In Dreams&quot;, which is enough to buy the CD alone. This is an album of epic, operatic proportion. I thank everyone who helped in its making - it is a work of pure beauty.

B00005QZ7U|4.0|I'm reading the reviews for Moulin Rouge, and I am really disappointed that people are panning it so badly.  What the heck did you all expect?<br />First off, it's the closest thing to a musical that you're going to get these days.  If you don't like musicals, don't see the movie.  I keep reading over and over again how people were \\"surprised\\" that it was a musical, or that they were \\"disappointed\\".  Umm . . . how could you miss that?  It was advertised as a musical expose'.   That means that there's going to be (gasp) singing and dancing!<br />Secondly, admittedly (as a fan of musicals in general) Nicole and Ewan's voices aren't perfect, but they're not bad.  They're more than bearable.  Is Nicole Kidman the next Patty Lapone?  NO, but she can carry a tune and her voice is sweet if not powerful.  I actually LIKED Ewan's voice, but apparently that is a taste thing because more than one person has said that he can't sing, which I disagree with.<br />And thirdly . . . the story line.  Yes, it is melodramatic cliché.  Yes, the whole whore with a heart of gold thing has been done before, but you know what?  There is NO way that they could do this movie any other way.  The music and the visuals are SO extreme, that if you attempted to bring in a congested, complicated story, it would get lost in the visuals.  This movie is to watch with an artistic eye - the colors, the scenery, the beauty of it would outshine ANY plot-line.  Sticking with a tried and true story (the story of Orpheus, a greek hero/demi-God) was a bright idea.  People can follow it without too much effort - imagine trying to watch this movie with it's Can Can and dancing and singing and huge sets and ALSO trying to follow a plot bogged down in detail - it's sensory overload and you'd HATE the flick.  Thank you to the producers of Moulin Rouge for keeping something simple - otherwise, it would have been WAY too heavy.<br />Honestly, I can see where this flick is not for everybody.  Yes, there are bits ofit that make you roll your eyes (thus, my 4 star rating and not 5), but if you like to see beautiful things, if you like artistic movies, or if you like musicals, Moulin Rouge would be for you.  It's spectacular in its own way - I have not seen a movie as ambitious as this in a long while.  <br />Happy viewing!

0385505833|4.0|As you can probably tell, this book is totally different from John Grisham's previous novels.  It is excellent!  I thoroughly enjoyed it - just as much as I have enjoyed his other books. Mr. Grisham proved that he can make a positive contribution to another genre!!!<br />Granted, you will not find 'Skipping Christmas' to be terribly profound, but you will get some good laughs and a few hours of rewarding entertainment.<br />This story is about a couple that decide not to do Christmas this year.  They decide they will go on a cruise instead.  The story chronicles the couple's frustration of not exactly being allowed to be different and the frustration of their neighbors as they try to understand this strangeness and try to make them change their minds!<br />The ending is terrific and quite funny.  Mr. Grisham has given us a very clever and witty story, though it does make you think on certain things (such as, why do the neighbors and townfolk feel they have the right to make this couple feel 'wrong' for choosing not to celebrate Christmas!?)<br />In summary, an absolutely clever and quick book ... I recommend reading it!

B00005OAIE|4.0|After letting the CD spin in my stereo for a month or so, I have decided that I do enjoy Room for Squares, but I'm hoping that Mayer will mature lyrically and musically on his next album. <br />Mayer certainly has a wonderful voice and talent.  His songs -- with elements of Dave Matthews, Athens rock, and 80's jazz and pop -- certainly stand out in the sea of churned-out commercial pop.  But Room for Squares is a collection of songs that Mayer had written years ago, and they still reflect that high school immaturity.  The lyrics are lacking, and some of the bridges or choruses seem a bit gimmicky.<br />In spite of, Room for Squares is a solid album.  The tunes are catchy, and if you can pull yourself away from the cheesiness of some of the lyrics, you'll be spinning this CD for days.  Perfect for a party or road trips.  And &quot;3x5&quot;, a song Mayer wrote for his upcoming album, is worth the price of the CD alone.<br />There is hope for Mayer.  He is a talented musician and singer, and &quot;3x5&quot; proves that he can become a mature and gifted songwriter.  I look forward to his next album because I know he will be brilliant.  But for now, Room for Squares will tie you over.
B00005BJPO|2.0|At first, I was anxious to see all the new features and deleted scenes from one of my favorite anime flicks, and I was, until I actually watched the movie. While the graphics have improved greatly over the VHS, the new dubbing of vocals and sound effects are just inexcusable. It just doesn't have the same gritty feel of the original traslation. It seems like the traslators are more interested in fitting new words to the mouths of the characters than they are in staying true to the mood of the original. Furthermore, most of the voices sound like they were done by boys who are just reaching puberty....
B00005QXXO|5.0|I am a Radiohead fan, and even for me, this CD was difficult and foreign to listen to the first few times.  &quot;National Anthem&quot;, &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; and &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot; are a bit raw.  But after having this CD a week, I couldn't live without it.<br />The true gems on this CD are obviously &quot;True Love Waits&quot; and &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot;.  The live version of &quot;Plates&quot; is a gorgeous, focusing on the hypnotic piano melody and Thom Yorke's ethereal voice.  Also of note are &quot;Everything&quot;, &quot;Morning Bell&quot;, and &quot;Dollars and Cents.&quot;  In particular, &quot;Everything&quot; is a spirited rendition of the LP version.<br />Though this CD is pricey for a less than full-length version, it's truly worth the price.  Radiohead hasn't managed to disappoint yet.
0679720200|4.0|This novella is probably the most widely read of Camus' works. It is a case study in alienation.  The anti-hero and narrator is a man living in a moral and social vacuum.  He has essentially no meaningful connections with the world except for some transient sensual experiences.  Virtually everything that happens to him, the death of his mother, his work, his affair with an attractive woman, his murder of another young man, the prospect of execution, are received with indifference.  In The Stranger, Camus presents a universe devoid of intrinsic meaning and with no special place for humanity.  The life and plight of the anti-hero are told extremely well and this book has an impact completely out of proportion to its length.  Camus' ability to describe this state in unsentimental terms and his pursuit of this idea to its logical conclusion are powerful.  It is important to realize, however, that The Stranger presents only a part of Camus' demanding but ultimately rewarding view of life.  Related themes are explored in the less successful The Fall and the positive aspects of Camus' version of existentialism are explored in The Plague.  The anti-hero of The Stranger is the counter-example of how life can be lived properly and Camus does believe in alternative and meaningful ways of living.  I recommend reading this book in conjunction with The Plague.
B00005JKES|4.0|Yes, it's annoying to not have the pilot in the set.  Unfortunately the rights to the pilot are held by someone else.  Someone who obviously has the business sense of a gerbil.  Simultaneous release maybe?!<BR>For the uninitiated: Don't let this deter you from owning this!<BR>The pilot is available on Ebay at an extremely reasonable price. I received mine within days.  It's a minor inconvenience for owning possibly the best TV show ever produced.  It was a short run but Lynch was WAY over the heads of the average sit-com zombie.  <BR>The main reason I can overlook the omission of the pilot: I own the complete series box set on VHS.  The most god-awful picture and sound quality you can imagine.  Dubbed in Super Long Play to pack a bunch of episodes per tape, it was like watching something your grandma taped on one of those tapes that she records EVERY episode of Matlock on...over and over and over again...on the same tape...So just thank your stars it's on DVD and not on Grandma's tape anymore.
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt have come back with one of the best albums of the year.  They are beginnib to explore different types of music now, and intergrate them all, while adding their own unique sound.  My favourite tracks on this album are, Hey Baby, Start The Fire, In My Head, Detective and Dont Let Me Down.  This album is worth having so if you have any spare cash go out and buy it and you wont be dissapointed
B00000JMQE|5.0|This takes us back to the dark ages of The Wizard of Oz, with the following up of Return to Oz which introduces actress Fairuza Balk. As a child I had read the Wizard of Oz novels by Frank L. B. this followes the stories rather than the movie \\"Wizard of Oz\\" with actress Judy Garland. People I think where split on the movie because they were expecting a sequal just like the first movie. However, I think it was brilliant because it still follows the imagination of the child Dorthy and what happened after her trip to Oz, and the coming back to Oz. What happenes to a child back when the come back from a world of their own imagination back at the time? The parents or aunt and uncle who has lost their own imaginations thinks there is something wrong with Dorthy espically when she can't sleep. So at the time of age for new technology they take her to get shock therapy. However, when she escapes through the help of a mysterious friend she finds herself back in the Land of Oz where everything is ruined by the Nome King and Princess Mombi who has lots of extra heads for fashion wear. <BR>Dorthy is in the search of the locked up Scarecrow, and she meets new and fun friends along the way such as Tik Tok a helpful robot, Jack the pumpkin head, and a rather sort of strange Gump to save the Scarecrow and the rest of Oz. This also introduces the Queen Ozsma in which she was heavily played in the Oz novels.<BR>If you are looking for this movie to be a sequal to the movie which stars Judy Garland in \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" Then you will be disappointed. <BR>However, if you like the original novels for which Oz was really a bit darker than what the Hollywood Industry made the book title to be, and you want a fantastic adventure then you will love this movie.<BR>Also the people who made the movie is Brain Henson of Jim Henson productions who put together glamerous re-creation and more added fairy tale backgrounds and creatures.<BR>Fairuza Balk does an increadable job recapturing Dorthy. She was in movies such as \\"The Worst Witch,\\" and then much later \\"The Craft.\\"<BR>This is really a great movie for children probably 13 and up. I just recently received this DVD for Christmas, and in my 20's I still find it fantastic. It also brings a lot of childhood memories back. And also including in the DVD is an interview with Fairuza Balk who explains the making of the movie!
B00005QG9J|5.0|While this album seems to linger in more mellow, acoustic territory than Incubus's previous albums, it doesn't deviate from Incubus's pre-set path of incredible music.<BR>Track 1 - Nice To Know You - This is the perfect way to start the album...in the chorus, it goes from windy &quot;ocean&quot; rock to hard guitar strumming...one of my favorites.<BR>Track 2 - Circles - One of the harder songs on this CD - I love Brandon's vocals on this song.<BR>Track 3 - Wish You Were Here - If you haven't heard this song on the radio, you're a poor, deprived person. The lyrics to this song are awesome, and the guitar ebbs and flows like the tide.<BR>Track 4 - Just A Phase - One of the funkier, more experimental songs on the CD - long, mainly instrumental beginning before it enters into the verses and the chorus...the best opening lines to any song on the CD: &quot;I am bottled, fizzy water and you are shaking me up.&quot;<BR>Track 5 - 11 am - I love this song. When you listen to the lyrics, it's vaguely depressing most of the way, until a slight glimmer of hope at the end.<BR>Track 6 - Blood On The Ground - This song gets me totally pumped!!! One of the harder songs...gets me really hyped up.<BR>Track 7 - Mexico - Mellow, kind of melancholy song...amazing...<BR>Track 8 - Warning - This is a mellow, kind of vocals/guitar-driven song (has a tambourine in it!)...one of my favorite.<BR>Track 9 - Echo - Great song...mellow, but still emotional.<BR>Track 10 - Have You Ever - awesome, one of the harder songs, I love how the guitar starts it off.<BR>Track 11 - Are You In? - Great acoustic sounding song...seems kinda summer/beach - ish. <BR>Track 12 - Under My Umbrella - If I have a favorite song on this CD (which hardly seems possible) it might be this...nice, hard song, I love the chorus, which sounds expressive w/out screaming.<BR>Track 13 - Aqueous Transmission - Kudos to Incubus for mixing it up with this song! Sounds kind of Chinese-floating-down-a-river and the crickets are great.<BR>If you haven't bought this CD, what are you waiting for? There isn't a single song on there that you'll dislike!
1573225517|5.0|Wonderfully written.  The protaganist, Rob, an unsuccesful record shop owner nursing a broken heart, is funny and imperfect.  First you like him -- and then you don't -- and then you like him again -- and in the end, you're really rooting for him.
B000002P2V|5.0|I own this in three formats: (1) mint-condition vinyl, (2) a CD purchased in the late 1980s, and (3) this remastering. This is one of my favorite albums of all time, and I know it well. I can say that this CD remastering is the only CD that sounds better than my vinyl records, and it is the best remastering I've ever heard (to second my fellow Chicagoan). Pete's brother in law was in the studio in 1978, and he did a great job here of merely enhancing the existing source and not fiddling about with it unnecessarily. Simply unbelievable.
B000006IUQ|5.0|Hopkins commented that this was probably the most physically demanding role he had ever played.  Suspense, mystery, drama, and action...action...action!  Lead and supporting acting is flawless and the moving stays real, unlike many recent action-thrillers.<br />It has a classic wilderness struggle feel with endless twists.<BR>Without a doubt, 1997 Movie of the Year!
B00005R2M3|4.0|After hearing Shakira's single &quot;whenever wherever&quot; I was very upset. The Latin American Alanis Moursette, the feminist can sold herself out. She became Britney Spears. However, after listening to this record I have changed my mind. Shakira retains her emotional depth and heart felt lyrics. She is simply exploring her sexuality that was probably always there, but hidden until now. Most Latin Americans dance in her provocative manner and her clothing has not become scandelous. She has reinvented herself, while maintaing the ingenious lyrics and sound that captured fans ears and hearts 5 years ago.
B00003OSU4|5.0|Perhaps it's wise, first of all, to acknowledge all of the problems with the film: It frequently finds sailboats and pretty women more photogenic than jazz musicians; it deems it necessary to cut away from the &quot;real&quot; musicians to shots of classical string players rehearsing and generic, hokey &quot;Dixieland&quot; musicians marching; it truncates all of the musicians' sets and completely omits some of the best performers on the program (Duke Ellington, Miles Davis); it gives too much footage to musicians whose association with jazz is tenuous at best (Big Maybelle, Chuck Berry, Mahalia Jackson).<br />Having said all that, the purchaser of this DVD still owns perhaps the best example of photographed jazz until films like Clint Eastwood's &quot;Bird&quot; and Bertrand Tavernier's &quot;Round Midnight&quot; appeared more than 30 years after this documentation of an idyllic, if unexceptional, moment in the music's history. Come to think of it, there's more pure jazz--in terms of quantity as well as variety--in this film than in the two aforementioned examples.<br />Filmmaker Bert Stern knew the body of Marilyn Monroe (his other noteworthy subject), but he knew nothing about jazz. Not only does the film seem all the more remarkable for his ignorance, but as an &quot;outsider&quot; to the music, he was in a better position to train his cameras and microphones on the images likely to appeal to the broadest audience even today (&quot;Bird&quot; and &quot;Round Midnight&quot; not only kept viewers away but were received poorly by viewers not already &quot;in the know&quot; about Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Lester Young and Dexter Gordon).<br />With the exception of this film, catching a jazz musician in movies or on TV has always been the rarest of experiences--like sighting an endangered species, then discovering it was all a false alarm.  Stern, by contrast, serves up a colorful, sumptuous feast of music. We see jazz musicians not as they're usually portrayed in film--black and white cameos shot in shadowy film noir compositions--but richly saturated, &quot;blushing&quot; 35mm Kodachrome color than hasn't faded like so much of the inferior film stock of the 1970s. And this is no Woodstock audience--there are empty seats, there are old faces, black faces, infants' faces. There's a leisurely quality that allows time to stop on essentially static visual compositions while the music swirls around the mechnical operations of the camera, constantly arguing its prior claim to our attention.<br />For a change, the music is no mere accompaniment to the images; Stern manages to achieve the opposite effect, making the images do the job normally assigned the film score. It's the candid and ordinary, yet striking, images of all these fascinating faces, this crowd of music-makers, some with instruments and others merely with the capacity to respond, that draw us, as if subconsciously, to the film's primary &quot;action&quot;--the music itself.<br />Although &quot;Jazz on a Summer's Day&quot; may pale compared to any number of &quot;actual&quot; summer days experienced by many fortunate jazz fans, it remains the closest approximation of such an experience on film.film--black and white cameos shot in shadowy film noir compositions--but richly saturated, &quot;blushing&quot; 35mm Kodachrome color than hasn't faded like so much of the inferior film stock of the 1970s.

B00005RIXP|3.0|Although Marton was wonderful as usual, her dynamic voice could not make up for the sound quality. There were points when the orchestra overwhelmed the artist. I suspect this was recorded as a &quot;whole&quot; versus miking the individual artists. I was reminded of home movies.
B00005JKES|5.0|It means, \\"buyer beware\\" as I'm sure most of you know.  The pilot is missing from this set, yes.  ....  <br />The set itself is stunning, both in it's packaging and contents.  Each episode can be preceeded by a Log-lady intro of that episode... mostly enigmatic rants about light and dark... owls and such.  The menus are beautifully made up from images from all the episodes, and the DVD becomes an experience, not just something you watch.  <br />Bottom line - Get over the exclusion of the pilot.  You can get it elsewhere.  Concentrate instead on the incredible work and thought that was put into this special edition (more \\"special\\" than most I've ever purchased).  This was worth more than I paid for it, and I eagerly await Season 2.
0060974176|5.0|This book is a classic on the advantages of being lean - Product Design, Manufacturing, Supply Chain Management - the entire gamut from concept to delivery in the Automobile industry. <br />What Ford's mass production did to craft production and its profound effects on the developed economies in the first half of the last century is an old but interesting story. With the advent of Ford's manufacturing techniques, there was a consolidation in the Auto industry. Within a couple of decades the number of automobile manufacturers fell from over a hundred to less than twenty and the big three cornering over ninety percent of the market share. Detroit became the center of pilgrimage for the rest of the world trying to emulate and replicate this success story in other continents. <br />Silently, the Japanese led by Toyota were working on a different concept of putting the automobile in the hands of the customer, at better quality, lesser costs, shorter development times and with the ability to offer a wider choice. The statistics collected from these &quot;lean systems&quot; is mind boggling. The competitive advantage that Japan enjoyed over the American system was neither due to lower wages in Japan nor due to higher levels of automation as widely believed. It was primarily the lean machine that was conquering the mass machine.<br />This book is based on the research done in the 1980's and published around 1990. The authors while acclaiming lean manufacturing as the panacea for the ills of manufacturing systems globally had at the time of the research and the publication of this work, probably ignored the next major change that would sweep across continents. Cars ride on highways, but today's businesses are quickly shifting gear and using a super fast highway for collaborating and for managing their global presence. Thanks to the Internet, the economics of information is transforming the economics of things. Dell is probably a good example of the new business model that could not have been imagined in the 80's. The tearing down of artificial walls across countries and continents also happened in the last decade. <br />We are badly in need of a repeat research study of the kind done in this book, in the face of the new realities. Global companies run by global citizens serving a global market and using a global currency will probably happen sooner than we expect.
B00005NEZ3|5.0|Gorillaz makes a great hip-hop rock on this CD.To spite the language this CD is a smash.&quot;Clint Eastood&quot; is the best song.The other cool songs are &quot;Re-Hash&quot;,&quot;5/4&quot;,&quot;Rock The House&quot;,&quot;19-2000&quot;,and&quot;M1A1&quot;.Together 2D,Russel,Noodle,and Murdoc make great music.I like this CD because it mixes diferent music to make a great CD.Gorillaz is my friends and my favorite band.
B00004R99M|5.0|Standing strong beside its major competition in the 60's is Walt Disney's classic adaptation of the Mary Poppins books.  I enjoyed it as a kid; I LOVE it as an adult.<br />I will quickly acknowledge that it is flawed: Flying wires are visible; the &quot;exterior&quot; sets are obviously indoors in studios; etc.  But the creative storytelling, fun adventures, big stars (Who couldn't enjoy watching Ed Wynn laugh himself onto the ceiling?), and brilliant songs cause the objective viewer to forget its shortcomings and lose himself in the magic.<br />It is the story of Jane and Michael, two children who love their father dearly; but the father has formed his own hard views of how life is to be lived, and can't see the love and joy his children want to share with him.  When Mary Poppins breezes in (literally) to apply for the job of nanny, she brings with her a firm commitment to living life to its fullest.  The infectious atmosphere of joy she spreads touches everyone she meets, changing the heart of the father, and opening him up to the wonders life has to offer to him, particularly through his children.<br />Parents with any soul at all will be touched.  Children with any imagination at all will be enthralled.  I personally have laughed and cried, even at age 27.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Another classical McCartney's CD. As usual unbelievable song writing. DO NOT LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS. They don't get Paul.<BR>His music is not for the average hits listeneres. You need to play it a few time until get it.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Yes, Brit does better with each album she has released. This one has to be her best. <BR>My fave track is &quot;Overprotected&quot;, by far. It's upbeat, easy to sing along to and makes you dance. Other awesome tracks are &quot;Boys&quot; &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot; &quot;Lonely&quot; &amp; &quot;Cinderella&quot;.<BR>The only track I really didn't like was &quot;Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot;. It's a bit too slow, and soppy. <BR>Britney co-wrote a lot of tracks on this album, and she's a very talented singer.
B00005RFVL|5.0|I love Robbie Williams, I love Swing, so it was the easiest decision ever to buy this CD. <BR>I'm madly in love with Robbie's rendition of Mr. Bojangles, I get teary eyed every single time I hear it. The duets with Rupert Everett, Jon Lovitz, and his best friend and room mate Jonathan Wilkes are hilariously funny, you can tell what a good time they had recording. I Will Talk And Hollywood will listen is a very sweet song, though it doesn't really fit in with the rest. If you know his history though, you know how personal the song is.<BR>I was lucky enough to see the Royal Albert Hall concert on TV, and let me tell you, the album was sold out the day after it aired. So if you have the chance to buy it on DVD or VHS, and if you can play it on your machine, get it, it's even better than the album. <BR>For those who don't usually like Robbie Williams, let me just add this. I know of 4 people who usually can't stand him, and they all bought this album.
0345448898|1.0|Why the low rating? A few observations in Q &amp; A format:<br />1. &quot;On purely aesthetic grounds, is this a truly great example of Fantasy Literature?&quot;<br />  YES. Considering the beauty, detail, and believibility of the fantasy worlds Pullman creats, and the skill with which he weaves them together, this is certainly on a par with Tolkein or Frank Herbert's Dune books, and I would rank it above the Narnia or Harry Potter books (though that last might provoke some dissent....)<br />2. &quot;By the traditional standards of any 'Abrahamic' religion (Judaism, Christianity, Islam), is this a blasphemous work?&quot;<br />  YES, most definitely.<br />3. &quot;Besides the blasphemy, are there other elements antithical to those religious traditions?&quot;<br />  TO NAME A FEW: hostility towards organized religion, towards the marraige bond, and towards the notion of a fixed morality. Favorable portayal of fortune-telling techniques as a guide to decision-making.<br />4. &quot;You must admit, though, that the book raises some interesting philosophical issues. Does it do a good job of resolving them?&quot;<br />  I THINK NOT. I don't want to get into specific plot elements here, so as not to spoil the ending for anyone who does decide to read the book. Let's just say that--having thrown off the yoke of divinely inspired morality--the main characters are then confronted with an ethical dilemma that a child of 6 could solve. Their success in solving it is hailed as a triumph of the human spirit. If Pullman wants to show how we can get along without a divinely-provided code of conduct he'll have to do a lot better.<br />5. &quot;But you said the book was beautifully written. Doesn't that count for something?<br />  IT COUNTS NEGATIVELY. As C. S. Lewis said, you don't get devils from fallen sparrows, but from fallen archangels. While I don't share Lewis's (and apparently Pullman's) belief in an independent Devil, I would agree that when great gifts are turned to a foul purpose, they only serve to make the offence worse.purpose, they only serve to make the offence worse.
0070511136|3.0|Having some knowledge of the subject, I am of the mind that selling is next to impossible to teach, learn and predict. This may raise eyebrows, but let's deal in veracity, shall we?<br />Man has not invented or perfected the science which can predict human behaviour, reaction or rsponse. Psychologists and sociologists may well be the first to tell you so.<br />Given this context, no text can claim to have mastered the art of selling - it just is not a possibility.<br />Having said that, SPIN Selling does as good a job as any; having researched and field-tested its recommendations and results. That is as good as it will ever get - and yet, as mentioned earlier, there are no guarantees.<br />As such, I admire the book for being best-of-breed, but have to believe that neither this nor any other method will come close to covering it all or covering it precisely.
0156012197|4.0|This book is really a good choice for children. The story is funny, interesting and full of imagination. For an adult, you may think that the story is too silly or crazy. But it is very suitable for those children who are full of imagination. The pictures in the story are also very cute. It shows the planet that the little prince lived on and other places where he had been visited. For me, I think this book is easy enough for a 8 years old child and is suitable for all sort of people.
0446525537|5.0|In the year 1998, a fifty-seven year old man reflects briefly on the spring that changed his life four decades ago. When he was seventeen, Landon Carter spent most of his time escaping impending adulthood by hanging out with his irresponsible friends and hanging around with them at the local graveyard. By today's standards, according to him, this was rather tame behavior. But back then, he was considered something of a rebel considering his family's wealthy background, his sweet mother, and his more-often-than-not absent father. He is simply a boy with no idea what direction his life will take when he unexpectedly finds himself becoming a man with the help of a minister's daughter.<br />Jamie Sullivan is the quintessential good girl. She helps out at the local orphanage, heals wounded animals, and is kind to everyone she meets. She is also something of a plain Jane and is seemingly comfortable with the fact that she is different from others. Landon Carter asking her to the homecoming dance starts a relationship that is slow to blossom but is heartwrenchingly beautiful by the time it is in full bloom. As the two slowly, and even more reluctantly, fall in love, they find their happiness threatened and their faith tested.<br />This is the first book I've ever read by Nicholas Sparks and I doubt that it will be the last. I was incredibly moved by the love that was shared between Landon and Jamie. Their relationship forced me to look at love from a more spiritual perspective. Despite the fact that I am not a fan of first person narrative, I came to realize that the story coming from Landon's point of view simply made it all the more powerful because it is he who develops and improves. And too, through him, we are better able to understand, empathize, and relate to other characters especially Jamie whose religious fervor might be initially off-putting for those to whom faith is not the cornerstone of their existence. How Jamie compels Landon to tap his potential will moveyou to tears as you watch him become a better person, the person she knows he is capable of being and he never dreamt of becoming.
B00005LOUQ|1.0|I saw this movie in the theater last year and I didn't like it. It was one of the worst family movies I have ever seen. Jim Carrey looked good as the Grinch but I was expecting it to be Jack Nicholson or Tim Curry. Because you know in Home Alone 2 when Kevin was watching The Grinch in the Lemo and Tim Curry had the perfect Grinch smile. But I don't know Jim Carrey was allright as the Grinch. If you want to see a good Grinch film go get the animated version. This version of the Grinch is really dumb and it's not good for kids to watch. The only thing that's good about this movie is the song by Faith Hill \\"Where Are You Christmas.\\" Stick with the animated version don't see this piece of ...!
B00005JKMO|2.0|I went to see Ali with great anticipation based on the trailers and behind the scenes television spots.  I am almost fifty years old and grew up following Ali's amazing career and life.  <br />I'm not sure what Michael Mann was attempting to capture, but I feel he missed in all areas.  The story doesn't really go anywhere.  It just sort of rambles.  It spends far too much time on musical montages.  One scene of Ali doing road work in Africa just seems to go on and on and on.  <br />The casting is a real plus.  Will Smith captures Ali better than anyone (short of Ali himself).  Jon Voigt almost steals the picture with a remarkable performance as Howard Cosell.  Jamie Foxx and Mario Van Peebles round out an excellent cast.  Unfortunately their not given a very good story to work with.<br />I recommend you rent &quot;When We Were Kings&quot;.  A documentary about the real &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; starring the actual participants.<br />&quot;Ali&quot;, I'm afraid is a waste of time.
0553573403|5.0|Martin breaks all the rules, the least of which &quot;the good guys always win&quot;. Granted, the series is far from over, but already it's believable fantasy with bitter twists where no one is exempt from death or dismemberment. Light years beyond other fantasy epics. A Song of Ice and Fire can't be compared to any other works comprising the genre, it's in a class all by itself. Not only will you have to use your head, you'll have to use parts of it never before tapped. Nothing is spelled out and Martin refuses to drop the &quot;typical&quot; hints for the simpler minds to get a leg-up - just try to guess what may happen. A literary rush!

B000055Y0X|5.0|A lot of people have told me of Dr. Strangelove (my all time favorite movie), &quot;It's not that funny.  All the humor was pretty obvious, or just pretty silly.&quot;  What must be understood about this movie is that Dr. Strangelove is not a straight comedy.  It is a satire; there are few distinct &quot;events&quot; which would prompt laughter.  The humor in Dr. Strangelove is synonymous with it's genius: a constant current of absurdity punctuated by moments of such extreme absurdity as to embody hilarity.
B00005U122|5.0|I had 2nd row seats for this concert at the Rose Garden in Portland Oregon. Of course, I had to get the DVD as soon as it was released. It is all I hoped it would be and more. I highly recommend this DVD for any Floyd and/or Roger Waters fans. Think about it like this - you get over 2 hours of high quality concert footage with the sound quality that you would expect from Waters. Additionally, there is bonus material including rehersals, and still photos. There is an audio setup menu that allows you to fine tune your surround sound and you can even turn the subtitles on to make sure you haven't been singing any wrong lyrics over the years. You can buy the DVD, have it delivered, and still get change back from a twenty. What are you waiting for?

B00005N5S5|5.0|If you have a VHS copy of this film, please drop it in the trash ASAP and order the DVD now. In widescreen, absolutely the only way to go, the film looks great and is loaded with some really neat extras.<br />Director James Cameron says that he thought of the premise for the film all in one shot while he lay sick in bed while in Rome. What an excellent premise it is too. The terminator, played by Arnold is sent back in time, about 45 years, to kill the woman who would eventually give birth to the man leading the resistence movement against the &quot;HK's&quot; (hunter-killers) in the year 2029. Also sent back, to make sure the woman (plyed by Linda Hamilton) lives is Kyle Reese, played very well by Michael Biehn. The film is best when it is in the cat and mouse mode that Arnold and Biehn are continually engaging in.<br />In addition to a pretty darn good film, we're given two good documentaries. One of those is an informal conversation between Schwarzenegger and Cameron about how the film came to be and some of the things that went on during production. Topping that though is one of the better DVD documentaries you're likely to see in the &quot;Other Voices&quot; doc. which incorporates many of those who were involved behind the scenes and some of the painstaking processes that took place to get the film off the ground. I found it interesting that before the film was made, Director Cameron was literally broke and had to rely on his mother to send him hamburger coupons. That's one of the many little asides you'll learn about while watching the extras.<br />There's also the usual selection of deleted scenes, and while I like having those, one can usually tell pretty easily why they were deleted in the first place.  These are no exception.<br />Bottom line: this DVD is well worth the price and is a great additon to any serious collector's collection. Buy and enjoy.
B00005QIPH|5.0|How sad it is when controversial hype gets in the way of a good, straight-forward listen.  You hear how fantastic this band is supposed to be, and you have these expectations: you're all set to love it, or you're all set to hate it.  Either way, it's no way to sit down and listen to music.<br />To quote a friend, the Strokes &quot;unfortunately&quot; turn out to be quite good.  How much happier we could be with this album if we'd discovered it on our own, or if the band members weren't children of great privilege!  But when it comes down to it, who really cares about the back-story?  This could be John Walker's new album: when you put in a CD, isn't it the music that matters?<br />So, the music.  Shockingly, this music will appeal to some people and not to others!  I know, it's hard to believe.  But being the Arbiter of Excellence for All Civilization, I feel I'm qualified to clear up a few matters of angry debate:<br />Q. Are the Strokes as good as {The Velvet Underground / Television / Iggy Pop / Weezer / The Bee Gees}?<BR>A. Yes.  No.<br />Q. Are the Strokes worth the hype?<BR>A. Is your mother worth the hype?  Naw, I'm just messing with you.  Hype?  I don't know.  How much is the hype, in euros?<br />Q. Is this a good album?<BR>A. Yes.  Oh, yes.

B00004X0Q0|5.0|I'll be the first to concede that the vocal talent exhibited by ATDI isn't first class, I would say its about average.  However music isn't entirely vocal talent.  The saving graces of ATDI are their amazinf energy, incredible lyrics (which actually have deep meaning if you look at them), and awesome guitar and instrumental work.  Plus they provide a nice variety in the hum-drum pace of today's musical industry.  Too bad these guys broke up.
0792844793|3.0|I felt it's a movie of some quality, but definitely didn't think it's \\"one of the best movies.\\"  I also didn't agree this film's main intention was to show us that beneath every normal and happy surface, there always lies a dark side most of us cannot see or even are unwilling to see. Or if this was really the intention of this film, I would say it's not quite successful.<br />First off, I didn't see the town was portrayed as a normal peaceful town in the movie to begin with. We saw an old man hit by some sudden disease (presumably stroke) only a few minutes into the movie. Then not much later we saw Jeffrey (the male lead character) pick up a severed human ear. Well, I really couldn't sense that this town was beautiful or peaceful even at the beginning of the movie.<br />The later part of the story involving Jeffrey investigating into the matter revealed what's supposed to be the dark side of the civilized society. But while Dennis Hopper's performance as the villain was excellent and Rossellini was convincing as the poor victim, in the story the dark side wasn't really that dark.... After all, it's not beyond an ordinary person's imagination. It's quite disturbing all right, but I couldn't really be shocked or unsettled by it.<br />Some scenes of the film were clever, well-crafted and funny, however: The twisted hose and the stroke-struck old man; The ugly bugs beneath the grass; The oxygen-mask-wearing Frank raping the helpless Dorothy; Frank's buddy Ben singing \\"Sand-colored clown\\", etc. etc. Also, some other scenes are weird and fun to watch.<br />But I don't think the superb acting (except Laura Dern's...) and some outstanding scenes were nearly enough to warrant the high regards so many reviewers bestowed on the movie. Maybe had I watched this movie in 1980's, I would be much more impressed. But I think this movie failed the test of time. To a viewer of the 2000's, while such true classics as \\"Clockwork Orange\\" or \\"Graduate\\" still bring awe, \\"Blue Velvet\\" islittle more than mediocre.
B00003CXXS|3.0|Ok, well this movie was overall pretty good. The action scenes were exciting and well done. The acting was ok and the new dinosaurs looked pretty good. Although there were a few things this movie lacked. When I first saw it in the theater, I thought it was missing like a whole half hour. They should have made a longer movie. Also, what was with that phone ringing in the stomach of the spinosaurus. Highly unlikely if you ask me. Another problem I had with this movie was that kid. He was suppossed to be this little twelve year old boy, who gets stranded on and island alone, just happens to find a watertruck to live in, happens to find food to live off of, I mean come on. How unrealistic can it get. The last thing I would like to say is why did Joe Johnston direct the movie? If Spielberg directed this one, as he did the other two, it would have been much better.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I Love this Cd!!!!  Incubus gets away from the screaming and anger of most Rock Bands.  They are able to keep the Cd in Rock genre but at the same time, making it soft and relaxing. If you listen to &quot;Wish you were here&quot; and &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; especially, you hear the master works of a very talented poet and musicians.  The picture of the ocean view is beautiful and matches with all the songs.  Listening to the songs reminded me of a morning view on the beach.  Get this Cd now!!!
B00005N9CV|1.0|What a disappointment. If this is the direction Diana wants to take her career, fine, but I suspect it's the record producers who are to blame for this CD. Before I buy her next CD I'll check to see if there is an orchestra involved. If there is, I'll pass. And the art designer has a foot fetish.
B00005JKOV|5.0|&quot;waking life&quot; is the most profound piece of cinema i have seen since &quot;requiem for a dream.&quot;  although the story may seem incoherent to some, i personally found it to be quite the opposite. by weaving together collections of various monolgues about the nature of reality and dreams, linklater creates an intellectual masterpiece that is both thought-provoking and life(or death) affirming.  the closest thing to cinematic enlightenment; very taoist at times(i.e is reality a dream or are dreams reality?) definitely not a film for those who don't like to think too hard or those who feel uncomfortable when confronted with strange and unusual ideas.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I highly reccomand the DVD for anybody who remembers the truffle shuffle.  This is one of the best kids movies of all time because for one thing it doesnt talk down to it's audience the way so many other kids movies do.  It has a fun plot to it as well as Corey Feldman.  I have introduced my niece and my nephews to this movie and they just love even though the movie is nearly twenty years old.  I also loved the extras that came with this DVD as well.  It had the classic Cyndi Lauper music video which is a fun one to watch if you are a wrestling fan.  I also loved the fact that it also show the kids all grown up.  Please purchase this if you are a Goonie just like me.
B00003CXXS|4.0|Ok, if anyone has not seen the movie, please skip my message now...<br />Ok I found it was an awesome movie except for a 12 year old boy to last 8 weeks on an island with old canned food, massive dinosaurs everywhere, and no water or anything...But the plane crash and everything else was good.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|i saw this guy open up for tori amos when i saw her live in charlotte ,nc this past year. generally speaking,i can't wait for the opening act to leave the stage so i can spend time with tori but i was truly amazed at how much i loved this guy and how profuund his work truly is. not to mention he has an ironic sense of humor which is absolutely delightful. i even managed to get an autograph after his show which meant a great deal to me. it's almost inevitable that many folks would probably want to compare him to someone contemporary like ben folds but i see his music as an extension or almost a homage to those great artists like elton john, earlier billy joel, or even some work by john lennon. i am willing to bet that given time he could be as good as any of the ones i've mentioned here because he has tremendous potential as shown on this masterpiece which i play atleast once a day. it's virtually hard to choose any favorites at this time as i've listened to his album numerous times and i still smile each time i hear it. you might want to check out the title track or cigarettes and chocolate milk. rufus, i can't wait for your next album man !!!
B000002AGE|4.0|Weather Report was a very ground breaking line up then... Some of the sounds are a little dated, but that was due to the technological timeframe and the equipment they were using. It was up to date then, and some may think it sounding a little cheesy, but that WAS the technology at hand during that point in time. Weather Report and many others stayed current, but things have progressed exponentially since... <br />Anyway <br />(WHY I OWN THIS ALBUM, CASSETTE & CD) see what I mean about advancing technology!<br />There was electric bass before Jaco Pastorius and THEN there was electric bass after Jaco Pastorius. <br />The importance of this release was the (new member) ground breaking bassist Jaco Pastorius. He upped the ante' on the Weather Report \\"sound\\", he funked, he grooved he did back flips off of amplifiers -- he was Jaco. <br />It was the influence of \\"early\\" Jaco which brought a diverse fan base to Weather Report, other fusion bands and Jazz in general. <br />I like this release because I admired Jaco Pastorius during his early period. This was the \\"clean\\" Jaco, before alcohol, drugs and his manic depression took a hold of him. Sadly, he died a tragic death at age 35, a shell of what we hear on these tracks. <br />True mastery.

B000003S0P|5.0|Describing why one likes certain music is a lot like describing color to a man blind from birth. Words fail. Largely because music affects us each in a different way. What appeals to me may be trash to you.<br />That said, I have to tell you that Red is the standard by which all King Crimson is measured in my book. It's heavy, melodic, melancholy and bears up to repeated listenings, which is the gauge I use for all music I consider priceless and timeless.<br />The '73 to '74 line-up featuring Jamie Muir (on Larks' Tongues in Aspic only), John Wetton, Robert Fripp, David Cross (on Lark's Tongues and Starless and Bible Black) and Bill Bruford is -- to my ears -- the best combination of Crimson musicians this side of the original line-up in 1969.<br />Wetton's plaintive, soulful, yet powerful voice meshed perfectly with the odd-metered, often dissonant music produced by Fripp et al.<br />Bruford's drumming is extraordinary. Fripp's guitar never sounded better. There isn't a dud on the album.<br />My favorite tracks are &quot;Red&quot; (the opening track), &quot;One More Red Nightmare&quot; and the epic album-closer &quot;Starless.&quot;<br />The 24-bit remastered version truly makes this album come to life like never before. The lows are crisper and more prominent. And the mid-range is much less muddy than on previous editions.<br />If you're a fan of King Crimson, you probably already have this CD. (If you don't, you should be ashamed of yourself.) If you're not familiar with King Crimson, but you like your music intricate, challenging but always rewarding (not to mention heavy on the guitar), give Red a try.<br />Once you hear Red, though, be prepared to buy the other two CDs by this classic line-up from the world's most consistently fascinating band!
B00000J7SS|5.0|If you're wondering were to begin with the 'electric' period of Miles Davis, his jazz - rock fusion period, don't look any further. You just found it! Fans of fifties Miles and 'Kind of Blue' fans, a sign of warning - you'll be in for a surprise! And what a surprise it is! Listen to it with head - phones, that way you'll get the full satisfaction. Mind - blowing and timeless, for the jazz and none - jazz listener alike. I don't listen to jazz (well not a lot) so when I first heard it I was astonished. I had never heard anything like that before. Although the tracks are very long (up to 27 minutes for 'Bitches Brew'), all 94 minutes on the album will pass really quickly.<br />Don't expect to hear something mellow, this is dark, sometimes scary music for those late nights. The first time you listen to it you may not even like it, so it requires an open mind. There are hard rock rhythms with the fiery trumpet by Miles, the sax by Shorter, the 'screaming' guitar work by John McLaughlin, the driving beats of the drums by Jack DeJohnette, the piano by Zawinul...Wow! Song highlights include 'Bitches Brew', 'John McLaughlin' and 'Miles Runs The Voodoo Down'. This is the album that started a revolution, that started the fusion sound of the seventies that many other groups will follow , and for that it will always be considered as one the most important jazz albums ever.

B00005R2M3|5.0|I admit I never even heard of Shakira before her first English release, &quot;Laundry Service,&quot; but wow!  She is an amazing talent and no diva in the U.S. even comes close.  This album offers a variety of ear candy, from dancefloor-friendly tunes like &quot;Whenever Wherever&quot; with much Latin flavor to introspective ballads like &quot;The One.&quot;  I don't understand or speak Spanish and still liked her Spanish songs, especially &quot;Que Me Quedes Tu,&quot; for its sheer emotional force.  Not to mention, Shakira plays the guitar, harmonica and possesses a certain exotic sensuality that makes Britney's artificial &quot;charms&quot; seem rather superficial by comparison.  It's about time Shakira's musical talents are shared to regions outside of Central and South America.
6302968135|5.0|It's always interesting to see a picture based on the ties between family or close relatives.  The most curious part is to see how each person deals with and in the family they're born into.  Since we cannot choose our family or the position we were born into, some give in to the circumstances around them while others use them to their advantage. What I mean is if the circumstances are not as they should be or undesirable life is much difficult.<br />Some ties can never be broken!  One of the most important factors that shape our life is the family we're born into.
052594527X|4.0|This book initially caught my eye because I am an admirer of Vermeer's paintings.  I don't read much current fiction because I find most of it to be trite and boring. Instead, my personal preference is to read historical biographies or other historical works. This book claimed to be historical fiction and the subject seemed interesting so I thought I'd give it a whirl.  Imagine my surprise when I found myself transported to the world in which Vermeer lived and painted.  I found the writing to be incredible in its ability to evoke images of Vermeer's paintings as well as the process of painting itself.  Tracy Checavlier's writing is terrific and I was wholly entertained when reading this book.  The book works on many levels and I'm sure that I will read this book again in the future.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a terrific story about a simple, young girl who discovers much about herself while in the company of one of history's great painters.
B000002AH7|4.0|The forever - changing and never resting Miles Davis, pushes the limits of jazz once more with this 1960 album called 'Sketches of Spain', managing to fuse jazz with an orchestra. Sure, he had done it before (with 'Miles Ahead' and 'Porgy &amp; Bess'), but this one is his most coherent and best orchestrated jazz album. It has a couple of Spanish tunes, rearranged by Gil Evans especially for this edition and I must say it sounds really interesting. The rest of the album is written by Evans. <br />Turn off the lights, lay down and put on the CD. You'll be transported to the distant and beautiful landscapes of Spain. Dreamy music which is very relaxing and soothing. That is why some consider this to be an 'elevator music' type. Not at all. It's to complex for that. Miles Davis sure knew what he was doing. His trumpet sounds as good as ever, and it has some great long solos by him. This album comes right after the landmark 'Kind of Blue'. 'Sketches of Spain' is one of Miles's best - selling albums. Maybe that's why it's being bought by people who have previously purchased 'Kind of Blue'. None the less, check it out.
0738203335|5.0|From the cover and the initial descriptions I've read about this book, I thought it was going to be centered around Linux. In reality, it covers most of the major open source projects. This book describes the beginnings of free software and many of the most innovative projects including: Linux, Perl, Xfree86, Apache, Emacs, Hurd, and many others. <br />&quot;Rebel Code&quot; is well researched and goes in to just enough detail. Mr. Moody is careful not inundate the reader with too many details. Besides giving a history of Linux and open source, the book examines the motivating force behind the hacker ethic and the fruits of free software.
078401213X|5.0|Is there a pattern in PI?  If we can find it we will understand the whole world....  I thought the movie was excellent.

0920668372|5.0|I purchased this book many years ago, one for each of my two sons, who are now 24 and 27 years of age.  My sons love the story and the concept and still refer to the book often.  I cannot even look at the cover without breaking down.  The book relates how the parent is the nurturer when the child is young, illustrates the trials and tribulations of parenting, its joys and pains and, finally, how parent and child reverse roles, with the son becoming caretaker to his elderly and fragile mother.  This pattern will, of course, be repeated by the son and his son and by all future generations.  It is a story of birth, love, sickness, life - anyone who is not deeply touched by this story has no heart.
B0000029DD|5.0|There's so much to tell about Buckley, I'm sure. After listening to this album I formed a mental picture of him as being this multi-talented great personality.<BR>This is quite odd, when I come to think about it, because I'm not that easily impressed. The question then seems to be: what caused this perfect picture of Buckley?<BR>Well, the first an no doubt most important reason is the brightest, intense, most beautiful voice I've ever heard, certainly the most beautiful in modern popular music.<br />Throughout the record his voice is explored. The opening track 'Mojo Pin' is a mysterious, dream-like song in which Buckley is floating in the sky with a naive, angelic tone in his voice, then being pulled back to earth, hearing his voice in a growing dispair.<BR>On 'Corpus Christi Carol' he sings more like a choir-soprano, and alo this is impressive. So impressive you keep coming back for more.<BR>Apart from his other-worldly voice Buckley appears to be quite a genius in songwriting. His songs are melodic, and are very distinctive from mainstream rock/folk music because of the intelligent way they're put together, what makes them attractive and won't let you be bored with them soon. 'Lover you should've come over' is an almost classic 'love hurts' song but still it has something extra. In that song are all the ingredients that will make you love this musician: beautiful melody; angelic voice; a recognizable but also mysterious story told by the music.<BR>The last song 'Dream Brother' makes him still more interesting when he sings to a friend: &quot;Don't be like te one who made me so/ don't be like the one who left behind easily/ becaude they're waiting for you/like i've waited for mine/ and nobody ever came&quot;<BR>Buckley's guitar is sad, dreams away, becomes angry and is resting in it's destiny. <BR>Jeff Buckley grew up without his father. His father was Tim Buckley, a famous 60's folk-star who died before he was 30, just like Jeff did.
B0000046WL|5.0|Hey, you lovers of Horace Silver, Art Blakey, Paul Chambers,Ron Carter, Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker, Oscar Peterson, Miles, Coltrane, et al: round out your collections of yesteryear's jazz giants, and then take heart, because there's a whole new posse in town. And this cd is a great place to start.<br />What a marvelous collection of young talent. Certainly, the cd belongs to McBride. He shows himself to be an extremely talented composer (The Shade of the Cedar Tree, Black Moon, Gettin'to It) and an already accomplished bass man. His solo interpretation of the great Night Train is audacious, confident, and attention getting.<br />McBride, however, doesn't hog the spotlight. Pianist Cyrus Chestnut is bluesy, tender, boppish, and extremely supportive. <BR>Roy Hargrove and Joshua Redman take their turns on trumpet and sax respectively and go a long way in bringing this strong material to life. Young trombonist Steve Turre even sits in on a couple numbers and wields that unwieldy instrument with detexerity and determination. And Lewis Nash on the drums holds everything and everyone together.<br />A few of the pieces feature McBride, Chestnut, and Nash in trio; a few more add brass or reed to the mix, and one cut--Splanky-- consists of only three bass players: McBride, Milt Hinton, and Ray Brown. That cut, along with McBride's solo work on Night Train, makes you wish these bassmen would get together for an all-bass outing.<br />Young lions, and two old giants--Hinton and Brown-- come together here in a way that makes you optimistic for the future, where the likes of Kenny G and &quot;smooth&quot; jazz can scare the life (and other things) out of you. Hinton and Brown seem pretty comfortable and confident here. You will, too. Get to Gettin' to It.

B00005QY5Y|4.0|First, I must admit 'Gold' is the first album I ever bought from Ryan Adams, so his musical history is sort of a blank to me.<BR>I only read some articles about him, every one of them talking about this country-ish boy-wonder with an attitude, former frontman of the well-known(?) country-band Whiskeytown at only 23. So I got interested and after a quick listening in a shop I bought 'Gold'. As is with every new album I buy; how I like it evolves in time. At first I kept playing a couple of songs again and again. Including the energetic opening song 'New York, New York' and the sad, melancholic 'Wild Flowers'.<BR>There are a few other songs like this, with a reasonable hit-potential in a certain musical circuit.<BR>Although these songs are nice to listen to they aren't really what I've been expecting from this &quot;talented singer-song writer&quot;. Nex to this nice pieces of music there are some quite ugly ones on this album too like 'Gonna make you love me' and 'Enemy Fire'. <BR>Fortunately, the album is saved by some really beautiful songs I discovered a little later in the listening process, including the optimistic 'Firecracker' and the poetic, dreamy  'Sylvia Plath'.<BR>I don't know how this young guy will develop his music after this album. I do know that he has some potential there to make a classic album, but if that will happen only the future will tell.<BR>All together 'Gold' is a nice album to listen to, so if your planning on buying it: I won't  stop you!
B00005OAIE|5.0|This CD has been in my Car for 3 months straight. I've seen John in concert 3 times and he is the best artist out there.  Every song on this CD is awesome! There is not one song that I don't love...which is really rare. He is an extremely talented guitar player and his lyrics are not over the top; they're perfect.  I love his lyrics, they're extremely creative and unique.  His music, infiltrated with his jazz roots, is indescribeable.  I gave this CD as a Christmas present to several people and would HIGHLY recommend it!

0767849493|2.0|This movie tried to be three things at the same time:<br />1) A rant against Catholicism.  Here the movie failed.  The writers obviously know nothing about Catholicism by their grossly inaccurate representation of what the Catholic Church professes.<br />2) A comedy.  Here the movie also failed.  Despite a few humorous scenes, the movie was loaded with foul language, toilet humor, genital humor, and drug humor  (although I know this kind of humor is appealing to so many moviegoers).<br />3) A suspense/thriller.  Here the movie succeeded.  If one can check reality at the door, one can really enjoy watching Bethany, Rufus, Jay, and Silent Bob try to stop two angels from unmaking the world.<br />The movie would have done better to stay on one or two of the above points.  Instead, it bounced back and forth among the three.  The fact that it only did well on one of them, and great performances by Linda Fiorentino &amp; Alan Rickman, makes this a two-star movie (barely).
B00003CY0V|3.0|I guess I fall somewhere in between on the 'drivel-to-drama' scale of reviews herein. I came to the movie with very low expectations, and thus came away not at all disappointed. All in all, it was better than I expected, but less than it might have been.<br />(I'll never understand those who complain about 'gratuitous' violence, nudity, profanity, etc. You see the trailer, you get the idea. Did you somehow think that this was going to be &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;? If it's not your kind of movie, then don't watch it!)<br />The overall pace is good, the story line is consistent (if not strong), and there are just enough surprises to keep one interested. It may not be much of a video library 'must-buy', but it's probably worth the rental (or used) price.
B000002J1M|5.0|I owned this album once before.  I got it when I was about 14 Years old, the third Genesis album for me (Selling England, And Then There Were Three) and possibly the best.  I don't like to think in terms of Better and Best.  I do think, however, that some of the Phil-Drivel after PG and Steve Hackett left, qualifies for Worst.<br />My wife bought me Foxtrot on CD for Channukah, as well as Going for the One (Yes).  I listen to the Yes CD when I feel like something lighter, less deep.  Nifty music, but with filler words that only sound serious because they're multisyllabic.<br />Foxtrot is a different story.  It's a lyrical account of the story of Creation and Human History.  I don't understand why people single out Supper's Ready, when it's obvious that the WHOLE album is based on a concept.<br />Watcher of the Skies:  Creation<BR>Time Table:  Crusades<BR>Get 'em Out 1:  Human Foibles and the Golden Calf<BR>Get 'em Out 2:  Playing God<BR>Can Utility:  Life and Times of a Prophet<BR>Supper's Ready:  Revelation of St John The Divine<br />The guys play together well, the only thing that sounds calculated and &quot;poppy&quot; on occasion is Phil Collins' blue-collar approach to drumming.<br />Gabriel gets into it with all he's got, and my favorite moment is the last part of Can Utility, when Steve Hackett's guitar sings along with PG.<br />It's just great stuff.<br />Bert
B000002OVJ|5.0|The Who's 'Live at Leeds' CD (the remastered, expanded copy) is incredible! It tastes of music in the years to come with the powerful 'Heaven and Hell', dreamily swirls with 'Tatoo' and 'Fortune Teller', and blows the listener away with 'Young Man Blues', and one of the best live versions of 'I Can't Explain' ever. The rendition of 'My Generation', et. al, is pure Who fury, and John Entwhistle's bass runs, while not twangy, were wonderful. Pete's leads on 'Leeds' were numerous, and had quality mixed with quantity. This album is perfect, and anyone who enjoys classic, mainstream, or hard rock should own this album!
B00000J6AG|4.0|Much of modern music is based off loops. Like most contemporary electronic artists Moby too uses loops. In all of his tracks you can notice the theme lopping over and over and over. Although the looping is boring by definition, Moby makes his loops interesting by varying rhythmical and synth patterns and ultimately capturing listener's attention by ever-changing texture of his synthetic tracks. Albeit, Moby's music is lacking something in the melody. Listening to Moby's &quot;Play&quot; album I a little bit miss the motion and melody development seen in classical compositions, or in more recent tracks by William Orbit or UltraMax Music. But still, the &quot;Play&quot; is unique in the way loops are re-processed and presented to the listener, especially considering that nobody's done it like this before. Overall - very interesting and album with some \\"fresh\\" sound and approach to composion.
B00005QDW1|5.0|For those of you who were expecting Tragic Kingdom II when Return of Saturn was released, you might find Rock Steady a step closer in that direction. Tragic Kingdom was a phenomenally strong album of pop, rock, and ska -- and those who preferred the ska element more will appreciate their fifth album. Before judging this album, however, know that the members of No Doubt, as evolving artists should, are experimenting with new sounds. There might not be a song reminiscent of the frustrated, feministic, in-your-face &quot;Just a Girl&quot; track, but there are many new gems here.<br />1 - &quot;Intro&quot;: A concise and harmonious beginning that adds a nice touch. (A)<br />2 - &quot;Hella Good&quot;: Already deemed a popular track by fans, this song takes you back to the dance halls of the 1980s. No reggae here - just pure rock. This track, however, is rather repetitive and disjointed (and hence not the strongest on the album). But it is pure fun and is a good song to which to dance. (B)<br />3 - &quot;Hey Baby&quot;: The first single off the album (with the help of Bounty Killer). A lot of debate has surrounded this single - is it a good choice for the first single? A bad one? Whatever your opinion is, it is definitely a radio-friendly, reggae-tinged song in which Gwen Stefani's vocals shine in a dominating, I'm-just-having-fun-gettin'-my-groove-on kind of way. Check out &quot;Start the Fire&quot; if you want a better song. (A-)<br />4 - &quot;Making Out&quot;: &quot;Funky disco&quot; are the words here. Gwen speaks before breaking into song. There is a rather memorable melody that is along the lines of &quot;Hella Good.&quot; The tune is not a stand out, but Gwen's vocals are.  (B-)<br />5 - &quot;Underneath It All&quot;: As soon as this song leaked out of my speakers, I knew this would be one of the best songs on the album. This song could easily blend in on the Tragic Kingdom album. A mid-tempo track accompanied by an unforgettable melody, gentle vocals, and a reggae influence, this is the best choice for the second single. Lady Saw lends her unique vocals in the middle that greatly strengthens the appeal of this song. What is particularly noticeable is the guitar work on this track - listen closely and see if you don't hear a little bit of Tragic Kingdom. (A+).<br />6 - &quot;Detective&quot;: Odd track with a metallic, visceral beginning. Punctuated by playful, childish high vocals and a, yes, enigmatic and furtive tone that is darker than fans will be used to, this song is another one that stands out. The ending flourish has a cacophonic overtone that is both bizarre but utterly creative and enjoyable. (A-)<br />7 - &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;: Another quick fan-pleaser that is radio-friendly. Yet another song that will bring you back to the 1980s, but please reserve your judgment until the chorus kicks in. There isn't anything exceptionally creative or new here, but there is this joyous and innocent quality about this song that will no doubt become a classic with fans. (B+)<br />8 - &quot;Start the Fire&quot;: This, along with &quot;Underneath It All,&quot; is the best track on the entire album. The soiltary vocals that begin the track immediately flow into rhythmic reggae beats and an immediately memorable melody that soars and bobs up and down like a Caribbean wave. The bass, keyboards, instrumentals, and Gwen's voice are all exceptionally sharp on this track. If you want to really hear the influence a Jamaica trip will have on a band, listen to this track first (and ignore &quot;Hey Baby&quot;). Sublime fan? This is a treat for you. (A+)<br />9 - &quot;Running&quot;: This track doesn't make your ears perk up right away, but hang in there...wait a few seconds until the gentle melody kicks in on this beautiful ballad. Many complaints have been made about Return of Saturn - too many slow songs! Make &quot;Running&quot; an exception, as this isn't your archetypal, tedious, pointless ballad. Not only is the melody strong,but Gwen proves her vocals are only improving as time progresses. Beautifully orchestrated. (A)<br />10 - &quot;In My Head&quot;: Pure No Doubt. It's fun, it's playful, it's bouncy in a subtle way, it's like a kid's circus show. This track dumps Sublime and adopts Save Ferris. &quot;Let's talk about Gwen Stefani,&quot; Gwen sings. As long as you guys keep on producing tracks like this, absolutely. (A+)<br />11 - &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot;: Rock song with a sharp guitar intro. Yes, the comparison is correct. This is No Doubt's Garbage song, but this isn't Version 2.0, just a light imitation of it that consists of a jumble of guitars, rockish vocals, and a pseudo-melody. Not the best track on the album; in fact, it is the weakest. (C)<br />12 - &quot;Waiting Room&quot;: Prince's fingerprints are all over this track. Several thumping beats start off this track with a bang, but Prince's influence doesn't show itself until  a few good seconds into this song. Overall, it's frenetic, it has tip-toe high vocals, a mainline sexy melody topped by &quot;wait for you&quot; lyrics, and experimental background noises that consist of interesting beeping beats. Takes a few listens to appreciate, but it ultimately is more creative and innovative than anything off Prince's latest album. (A-)<br />13. &quot;Rock Steady&quot;: The return of the intro. Warning: this is a slow song, but this is slow with rhythm, not slow in terms of a ballad. A steady drum beat accompanies Gwen's soporific vocals. A great (and somewhat somber) choice to end the album, as the track contains several fun sound effects. (A-)<br />This album is not Tragic Kingdom; it's not trying to be (albeit it inadvertently waltzes in that direction once in a while). However, it is an album that finally capitalizes on the reggae and the ska elements that many fans have enjoyed over the years, and I hope No Doubt continues to move into this direction, for ska-reggae-pop-rock is what they are good at. Rock Steady tookless time to produce than the sedate and overly-ambitious Return of Saturn, and, aided by several respectable contributors, this more blissful and carefree album is sure to please if a person is willing to mature as an audiophiliac (read: stop walking into &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;).
B00005QK3W|2.0|As much as I love and respect The Beatles (and their individual careers), and being a musician of many years of experience, I have to admit I am a bit disappointed with this effort. The music is just not that good!  This record does sound &quot;fresh&quot;, as Paul intended, but the quality of the music and lyrics are still beneath his recent album, Flaming Pie, and certainly much of his earlier work.  It sounds like Paul is in love again, and just getting a bit careless with his music! Only someone with his stature can get away with it and not have critics all over him.  Good for him!  I still hope Paul has many many more albums of quality music to come over the years.
B000002VMH|5.0|Five stars is not enough for this CD. Little Bird is one of the best, out of many that she has done. I have not heard one that I do not like!
B00005N6KG|5.0|For the price, these are the lightest, best sounding phones I've ever had. Deep bass, great highs. And they don't have to be loud to sound great!
B00005OWIU|5.0|If I've ever heard a CD that sounded magical, this is it.  It fit the movie very, very well.  Just listening to it you start thinking of Harry Potter and scenes from the book and movie.  They just seem to dance through you're mind.  I very highly recommend this CD to any one who likes Harry Potter or anyone that just likes mystical sounding music.  You reall feel as if you yourself are Harry Potter and you are experiencing his adventures.
0385505833|4.0|This book was a light/quick read!  It was a bit repetitive but that helped set up the zinger to come.  This book should have someone write a screenplay staring Steve Martin and Diane Keaton.... you can just imagine them in the two lead roles asyou read this funny novel.  enjoy!
B00005QK3W|5.0|First of all, don't let the negative reviews here cause you to miss out on Paul's best new album in many years. Some here have said this isn't as strong as &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; but I have to disagree. I prefer to think Paul's new-found creative streak started with that album, and he builds on that fresh spark even more convincingly with this new one, with better quality of songwriting from the first track to the last- this is a more consistent effort than FP. With great tracks like &quot;Driving Rain&quot;, &quot;Tiny Bubble&quot;, &quot;Heather&quot;, &quot;About You&quot;, &quot;Your Way&quot; (just to name five) one wonders how does the man still do it? After all these years, it's pretty amazing to still hear Paul writing songs of the caliber found here. I think two reasons: 1. Since Linda's passing, and, more recently, George Harrison's long battle with cancer, Paul has been inspired by the mortality of us all and decided- whether consciously or subconsciously- that it was time to get with the program and create something more inspired than what we've been used to hearing from him for the better part of his solo years. 2- The process of bringing these songs fresh and unheard by the band to the studio, where they learned them more or less on-the-spot, the same way the Beatles worked, combined with the production and eye-to-eye collaboration between Paul and David Kahne.<br /> At any rate, Paul sounds here like he was hungry to create some vital sounds again, and, in my (and many others') opinion, he has succeeded in a big way. Another reviewer here compared this effort with Paul's 1986 &quot;Press to Play&quot; in which Paul made music for himself. I agree with that assessment except &quot;Press to Play&quot; was a tip of the iceberg of what would eventually come with Driving Rain, Paul's best work since &quot;Band on the Run&quot;.
B00003Q438|5.0|Like many others, when I saw the original theatrical cut of the film, it left me feeling unfulfilled.  Cameron had to cut an entire subplout out to get the length of the movie down - he has a thing for making his movies long.  Unfortunately, there was no subplot that could be easily removed without compromising the intregity of the movie.  The theatrical release should only be watched to show someone what is taken away from the movie by removing the subplot - and never when you really want to watch the movie for the movie's sake.<br />This DVD, with the special edition full-length cut, gives the movie the opportuntity to shine in all of it's glory.  The ending which felt like a sudden &quot;left-turn&quot; at the end, coming out of nowhere, now fits in very nicely, truly resolving and connecting everything together.  The film itself now can truly work on all the levels, dealing with special effects that were groundbreaking at the time, a complex story with believable characters (I still can't see Ed Harris without thinking of 'Bud'), and a range of emotions brought out in various scenes.<br />The additional disc in this 2-disc set offers a number of definately worthwhile extras.  The 30-minute &quot;Making of&quot; feature is a must-watch for everyone who likes this movie - I had no idea how difficult and exhausting filming this movie was, and you can't really understand that it's &quot;the most difficult shoot ever&quot; without seeing what they went through.
B00003CXTF|3.0|It reminded me of Titanic. A tragic historic event clouded with a love story. The action scenes were fast paced with good special effects but the romance within the movie slowed down the whole pace. The interviews of real survivors, and accounts of the attack from witnesses, that follow the end of the movie are worth watching.
B000002ORU|1.0|THis box set by the WHo is a waste of time and money. First of all, the WHo has only three worthwhile albums: WHO's NEXT, QUADROPHENIA and TOmmy. Everybody knows that. So, it's simply impossible to fill 4 Cd's with great Who material. I'd like to know the genius mind who chose to insert spoken speeches all around!! What \\"exciting\\" they sound !! I'd also like to know who choe to insert a cover of TWIST and SHOUT here...But, well, like Pete Towshend arrogantly wrote in the preface of the booklet inside, if you don't like The WHo,.., you!!! What a nice guy !!
B00000ADG2|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of the Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. I never thought I'd see the day day when an album could entertain me from beginning to end and still keep me wanting more and Lauryn's album definitely proved me wrong.  Her talents seem limitless, and I hope to hear more from her in the near future!
0783216084|5.0|This film was a masterpiece of suspense.<br />I remember seeing it in the summer of '75.  I lived in Northeast Massachusetts, not far from where the movie had been filmed.  There was  a lot of hype floating around, everyone was excited.<br />As a result, the movie theater was packed!!!!<br />We all fed off each other's fear, as a result when the shock scenes came (like the floating body), we all hit the ceiling!<br />When the shark was finally done unto, the cheering nearly brought the house down!<br />After the movie, I had to rest.
B00005QIPH|5.0|In a year that produced several outstanding CD's, this one is the best.  Not only the best of this year, possibly the best CD released since I've been alive (1972).  A future Hall of Fame canidate, this one is equally good as such heavyweights as &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;, The Stooges &quot;Fun House&quot;, and Television's &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;.  30 years from now, this one will still be around...guaranteed.
0525945636|4.0|This was my first Ken Follett novel.  Since I have nothing to compare it to (his earlier work) I enjoyed it.  Certainly there were a couple of predictable parts, but all in all I enjoyed the story line and the plot.  I did have to keep reminding myself of the time period it was written for and why the subject was using a pay phone where he could have used a cell phone.  I enjoyed it and will purchase another Follett novel.
B00003CXXS|4.0|Is it better than the original Jurassic Park?, I don't know about that but I found it to be a lot more likeable than JPII. In the Lost World the script had very little to do with the book and ended up as a combination special effects fest and theme park promo. I found the plot in Jurassic III to actually make some sense for the most part and the Dinosaurs were incredible. I even thought most of the characters were good, the mercenaries weren't as smart as they thought they were and they certainly paid the price. The boy surviving on his own would be a little of a stretch, Dr. Grant's assistant making it to the coast without them is the least likely thing I saw in the movie, maybe more than Grant's former assistant (Laura Dern in a cameo role)calling in so much military help.
B000002N3N|4.0|Without a doubt, when it comes to creating musical valium, nobody does it better than Enya.<br />What you'll hear on this CD is one beautiful, mindlessly flowing melody after another. Fifteen minutes of this and all your worries, your responsibilities, all your guilt & pains, will be completely vaporized. You'll feel like a back country good-old-boy gently tubing down a cool river after 2 or 3 too many Budweiser's. <br />The track, \\"Hope Has A Place\\" - what a gorgeous piece of music - this stuff would cause a Tyrannosaurus Rex to curl up in its cage like a new born puppy - is probably the best track. \\"Athair Ar Neamh\\" is a lovely piece of church music though for all I know she is worshiping a rock. \\"China Roses\\" equally beautiful, spiritual in message but more romantic musically. A \\"Tea-House Moon\\" borders on the moronic, though it is not really all that out of place considering the overall mood of the CD. The last track, \\"On My Way Home\\" is very pretty and somewhat peppy - apparently designed to partially lift a person out of their trance so that they can push the little buttons on the remote and start the CD all over again.<br />Lyrically this CD is somewhat weak (hence  my \\"4\\" rating - the track \\"Anywhere Is\\" is a classic example of New Age psychobabble - which perhaps explains its popularity) but musically it is as rich, colorful and flowing as the gown she is wearing on the cover photo. And Enya's voice - who could do it better?<br />So shift your brain into neutral, strap on the headphones, and forget about any part of the universe you don't want to worry about.

0385474547|5.0|Chinua Achebe's 1959 novel, &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; is an extraordinarily well written and moving work.  It explores the traditions and cultural practices of the Ibo people of Nigeria in Western Africa at a moment of dramatic, astounding, horrific  transition.  Achebe provides us with a narrative seen through the perspective of Okonkwo, a man of quality and power in his village.  At the same time, Achebe's deep knowledge of European and American literature and the effects of European cultures on the native culture of Nigeria courses through the novel.  <br />&quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; begins with the recounting of Okonkwo's history - his rise from a family with a poor, indolent father to being a wealthy and successful farmer, warrior, and leader.  When a neighbouring village offends his own, Okonkwo represents his villages interests in a conference, in which retribution returns with Okonkwo in the form of Ikemefuna, who is sentenced to death, but forms a vital link in Okonkwo's strictly run household between himself and his own son, Nwoye.  The action of the novel follows the ramifications of the culturally-demanded execution of Ikemefuna on Okonkwo and his family.<br />Achebe's novel shows an astute sense of awareness of the various political structures of Ibo society.  Particularly, gender relations are brought into high relief throughout the novel - the councils led by men; their rank and status signalled in part by the number of wives a man has; and by Okonkwo's insistent, but shielded love for his daughter Ezinma, whom he continually wishes was a man.  Relationships between families are complicated with the coming of European colonists whose Christianity and industry endanger the Ibo way of life.<br />With tightly controlled narrative and emotionally understated elegance, Achebe's novel presents a proud individual, Okonkwo, representing the final undisturbed generation of a long-lived people.  His internal and external struggles are compelling and forthe receptive reader, potentially devastating.  A brilliant novel.
630289915X|5.0|Nobody's poor who has friends. This is the moral of this movie, one of the happiest and best ever made. A story of looking at our lives, not at the bad, but the good. Of discovering how we have affected others. <br />Jimmy Stewart plays George Bailey, a resident of Bedford Falls, who doesn't realize that he has affected so many people's lives in good ways. He mostly concerns himself with the present, which at the time isn't good. He has run into debt problems with his father's Savings and Loans building and attempts suicide. It's up to an angel named Clarence to save George and convince him he's led a good life. <br />Throughout his life, George was always a thorn in the side of Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), the owner of about everything in town except for the Bailey Loans building. George gave up going to college or around the world just so he could run the building. In this, he prevented Potter from taking over and being able to charge whatever rent he wanted and thus ripping off the people of Bedford Falls by having them live in rundown slums. But George's life was much more than that. If it weren't for him, the lives of his brother, the owner of a store (Who George worked for), of his wife and of about everyone in town would be very different.  <br />It is indeed difficult to review a movie like this, what with thousands of words already said about it. While there was some sappiness in it, particulary the ending, there is nothing wrong with this movie. It can cheer you up because it makes us think about all the good things we have done. Than again, if we have lead a bad life like Mr. Potter, it won't make us too happy. <br />George Bailey may not have been as financially wealthy as Potter. But because he was friends with practically the whole town, he was very much wealthier. Okay, so in real life the whole town probably would not give George all their money just so he could be out of debt. But it certainly makes you think. Enjoy!
B00005OAA6|5.0|Victoria has alwayz been my favorite singer so I knew this album would be great and it is. I think the best songs are Like That, A Mind Of Its Own, I Wish, and Whatchu Talkin Bout. You should all buy this album.
B00004Z4WQ|3.0|Scary Movie, definitely cleaner than its sequel, has its funny parts and its idiotic parts...The first 15 to 20 minutes is hilarious, but the rest of the film just has bits and pieces that are funny. Little of the raunchiness is funny, but you kind of have to laugh for its failed attempt...Scary Movie rates 3 out of 5 for its effort and its 15 minutes of fame...otherwise this film is poor...
630018160X|4.0|Like most musicals of the 1950s and 1960s, this story of a slightly dim but goodhearted dance hall &quot;hostess&quot; in search of true love lacks the spark of a truly great movie musical--but it is redeemed by Fosse's unique choreography, Shirley MacLaine's dazzling performance, a superior cast, and the way they combine in a series of brilliantly filmed musical turns. MacLaine is remarkably successful in the title role, entirely believable from first to last, and appears in two of the film's most memorable moments--the star-turn &quot;If They Could See Me Now&quot; and the exciting &quot;There's Gotta Be Something Better Than This.&quot;  The film also recreates Fosse's Broadway staging of the famous &quot;Big Spender&quot; number and offers Sammy Davis Jr. (a performer I usually dislike) a very effective and highly entertaining solo with &quot;The Rythmn of Life.&quot;<br />Although the film is rather stagey, a bit slow in spots, and occasionally artificial in a way that violates its own stylistic premise, Fosse and company keep the touching story line in good focus throughout the story.  The uncompromising ending will displease some, but most will find it more appropriate than the traditional happy ending associated with the musical genre.  Recommended.
B00005LOUS|2.0|Ok, basically, I must admit that I did enjoy this movie. I saw it with my sister and I liked it very much. It was a fairly satisfying movie. My favorite parts included Cindy Lou's (Taylor Momsen) version of &quot;Where are You, Christmas?&quot; and the ending part where the Grinch's heart &quot;grew three sizes.&quot; It's a classic story that has won the hearts of people worldwide. I'm pretty sure I'd recommend this movie to older audiences, but certainly not young children. While Jim Carrey is a good actor, his version of the Grinch was, in my opinion, way too intense for little kids. He speaks language that I personally wouldn't want my own kids to witness (if, of course, I had kids, which I don't). Too violent and inappropriate for young ones--give them a different Christmas movie to watch or show them the cartoon version of &quot;The Grinch,&quot; but don't break out this one. The kids can definitely stand to take a pass on the crude humor and sick jokes presented here.
B000002TQV|5.0|I have something to admit: I've been living under a rock.  It's been a nice cozy little rock, with lots of shade and that sort of thing, but I thought I'd go out and see what was happening in the world.  You can miss a lot living under a rock, including culture.  I've only found out about Radiohead, and I mean really found out about them, this year.  Not only that, I've only been really listening to them since October.  You may ask how I've gone so long without hearing about Radiohead.  That's a really good question.  Of course I knew their song &quot;Creep,&quot; but after that I wrote them off as a one-hit wonder, and it was a hit I didn't really much care for (I'm still not a big fan of that track).  Well, along came my discovery of OK COMPUTER, and I decided I had to get it.  And of course, THE BENDS as well.  Both are outstanding albums.<br />These two albums are Radiohead's most popular albums, and generally there are two factions of the Radiohead camp, each thinking their prospective album is better than the other.  Personally, I think OK COMPUTER is a better album overall, but track-for-track I'd take THE BENDS.  Listening to THE BENDS is very similar to listening to a Beatles record: if you didn't know any better you would almost swear this is a greatest hits record or something.  Each track is very noteworthy and Radiohead does not falter at all. Speaking of tracks, there are notable non-album tracks which would only have enhanced this album.  The six tracks on MY IRON LUNG ep (not counting the title cut and the acoustic version of &quot;Creep&quot;) would have been fantastic on here, and as I understand it are actually outtakes from this album.  Each of the six tracks are as good as anything found on here.  Also, there are some good tracks which I have obtained though I don't know if they are commercially released or not (some are B-Sides).  These are: &quot;Yes, It Is,&quot; &quot;Killer Cars,&quot; &quot;Molasses,&quot; &quot;Man of War,&quot;and &quot;How Can You Be sure.&quot; <br />All these stunning tracks coming from the band who, only two years before, released the unremarkable PABLO HONEY, makes this achievement all the more noteworthy.  This record plays like a band who has gotten a handle on where they want to go with their music and really pursuing that whereas with the 1993 release it seemed more they were getting used to even being musicians in the first place.<br />Another noteworthy thing to mention is this is Radiohead for the MTV generation.  This is them making high-quality guitar rock that is both accessible and artistically satisfying, which, unfortunately, has become increasingly rarer in the 1990s and the start of the new decade.  It is both very accessible to the mass audience and also pleasing to the critics, and is an across-the-board success, which, quite frankly, OK COMPUTER is not.  This is Radiohead doing radio-friendly rock, delivering one spectacular album which is one of the best of its kind before going on a very varied musical journey leaving this far beyond and getting much more experimental in nature. <br />Of their (so far) three more &quot;high-brow&quot; musical efforts (OK C, KID A, AMNESIAC), OK COMPUTER is both the most popular and the best critically received.  For personal taste, I prefer OK COMPUTER to this release, but both are incredible albums.  However, they're totally different albums, and OK COMPUTER marks the more conceptual and experimental path they are currently still on.  The effect of the overall album is more impressive and long lasting on OK C than it is on THE BENDS.  THE BENDS sounds like a study in radio-friendly rock, a compilation of all of rock's greatest moments whose only underlying connection is the tracks have a mass appeal and were big hits.  Each track of THE BENDS sounds like it could have been a number one hit.  On OK COMPUTER, that is not true.  While all the songs shimmer with brilliance and remarkable beauty, OK COMPUTER better stands as anoverall album than just track for track.  Much of OK's impact comes from the conceptual and album-driven cohesion which binds it altogether into a unified whole, and while each song is both fascinating and remarkable the overall impact is what really makes OK such a fantastic album.<br />But that would be a full two years away, and Radiohead was more concerned with making really good pop music.  It's almost as if Radiohead knew their direction and knew they had to get this out before they could go onto the more artier side of their music, and to their credit this comes across not only as radio-friendly rock but an unqualified masterpiece which modern pop should be judge against.
B00003CXTF|3.0|I have to agree with &quot;Kev4me&quot; in that this movie is not nearly as horrible as the critics claimed it to be. Alright, yes, the love story was pretty bad, but I think this movie was every bit as good as &quot;Titanic,&quot; which got excellent reviews. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is historically accurate, and that's what's important. It grasps the December 7th tragedy at Pearl Harbor extremely well, and the special effects are outstanding. This is my imput: If you're going for the love story, pick a different movie to satisfy you. If you're going for the historical facts and the opportunity to have a better understaning of the December 7, 1941 attacks, then &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is an excellent choice.
B00005U2LM|4.0|first off i'd like to say this is a good album better than that garbage the W but definetely not up to par wit the classic 36 chambers s**t.... what you get with this album is a lot of quality songs all wit nice flow and most wit tight beats... i especially like &quot;ya'll been warned&quot;wit meth spittin really hot at the beginin' and &quot;rules&quot; is simplistic but still catchy.... on the opposite of that &quot;radioactive&quot; is straight up garbage that is the most annoying beat i don't know what rza was thinkin with that crappy song, also flava flav on &quot;soul power&quot; is really annyoing and ruins that song... so if wu tossed out the few garbage songs and put in some half way decent ones in there place and ODB got out of jail and put some of his craziness on the album, this album would be a definet 5 out of 5......
B00005NNT1|3.0|While this film is undoubtedly a classic, well-loved landmark in Disney moviemaking, I've got to say that it's not for kids. This is THE most intense Disney movie I've ever seen. I mean, I'm 16 years old and I still fast forward through that ending part where the dwarfs are chasing the witch and she falls down the cliff. What kind of message is that for young children? I am not in any way bashing this movie--I think it definitely deserves its title as a classic, but I wouldn't show this one to young children
B00005QCYD|5.0|All you folks out there who didn't enjoy this movie need to have your heads knocked straight because this is good stuff here!  Sure it's short, but so what, this was definately worth my time, and it will be worth yours.  The Spinosaurus is really cool, and it, believe it or not, it is NOT a made-up Dino, it was real.  Buy this, people!  Worth seeing!
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Definitely a movie a viewer must watch at least 2 times to remember crucial important clues and relevant names to the plot. Quetin Tarantino style of direction. Time corresponded with main character's memory loss of the tragedy of his wife and himself. The brutal incident that occured in his home caused physical damage to his brain that would affect short term memory, OR DID IT? Sammy Jankis had similar problems with short term memory like Lenny. Leonard, the main character, was an insurance investigator who found that his memory loss was attributed to mental health instead of physical trauma. Leonard was mentally disadvantaged and others tried to take advantage of him for their own personal reasons. Very unique story line and direction. First film I have ever seen that focused on memory as being the most crucial element in uncovering the plot. The viewer will see small clues as the film advances and you will return to those same clues with more information to link the puzzle together. Incidents that occur don't chronologically follow in standard format. The movie begins with the ending. You will see random events that will link all together the further you watch this movie. It will make so much more sense near the end. It is a very compelling film that will keep you watching. It never gets boring. Scenes are very quick and if you turn your head or get up, you will miss vital parts. Pay attention to names. This will help you with association with the main character. Movie is executed very well with dialogue, acting, and time references. This movie can be seen by 10 different intelligent people and you could possibly end up with ten different opinions on it. Don't be surprised. The director wanted to leave it ambiguous for interpretation by the viewer. My philosophy is: The story is about a man who revenges his wife's death, realizing his own guilt, suppressing it with very strong denial. He is physically fine but his mental inner demons will not allow himself to accept the truth. Thereby, short term memory loss helps him cope with his profound loss of a loved one. All the characters seem like liars and it is hard to distinguish who might be telling the truth. Very clever editing and the relapses in time are exact with real time. You must watch the entire movie from front to finish to complete this puzzle. Very intelligent film making and direction with a strong supporting cast. My only complaint is that the film never clears up why and how certain character evolve into the story line. If this part was not so vague and more definite then it would receive 5 stars. Otherwise, a very interesting movie that forces the viewer to use his senses, attention, and problem solving ability. If you are an intelligent movie watcher that wants more than your typical and predictable script, then this is the movie for you. Memento will cause use to question with uncertainty on what you think you saw. This movie is a great discussion piece for philosophy and interpretation.
B00005ASHM|1.0|this has got to be the most over-rated, acclaimed, heraled, etc., and so on, album of ALL-TIME! Just because Sir Paul mentions it now and then, and that Mr. Wilosn scrambled for something-anything while in awe of Sgt. P. instead of calling it quits (which I believe he should have) doesn't mean we all have to KISS-UP. Let the product sell itself, ROCK is simple. Compare and contrast this with ___?___(fill in the blank) and get real. Stop searching for genius where there AIN'T NONE. You Know My Name, Look Up the Number and BAG!, please
0767802659|4.0|I won't comment directly on the video itself (it was a GREAT film), you can read the hundreds of reviews already on the film - but I will comment on the quality of the DVD:<br />The video quality was superb - very sharp and crisp and virbrant colors. The sound quality is pretty good but at times you can't tell the difference between the DVD and VHS version (I own both).<br />The extra features are OK - nothing to whine about but there really isn't much there. Die hard fans of the movie (I consider myself one) will appriciate the extra scenes, some which add an extra insight to the Zander-Carmen-Rico relationship. However, there are only 5 such scenes and each is about or less than 30 seconds long. The commentary left much to be desired: at many times it stated the obvious (&quot;we used computer generated bugs&quot;) and then there was Paul Verhoven's rambling which was inaudiable for most of the commentary. At one point, Mr. Verhoven tells us which scenes include computer geneation and which don't - he ends up saying:COMPUTER!REAL!COMPUTER!REAL! over and over again extremely fast to the point where you can't tell what he's talking about (they only flash the scenes for about 1/2 a second) nor do you care.<br />Overall the video quality and sound quality are good and the extra features are OK - a fan of the show to any degree will most likely enjoy the DVD although first time viewers or neutral viewers will be dissapointed.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This is an awesome cd. Here are individual ratings:<br />1)Objection (Tango)- This is a fun song to listen to and makes you want to get up and dance. Really good!  <BR>5/5 stars<br />2)Underneath Your Clothes- This is an awesome ballad. Shakira really knows how to sing. This is one of my favorites on the album. It's a slow song, but good.<BR>6/5 stars<br />3)Whenever Wherever- You've all heard this song already. It's awesome.<BR>6/5 stars<br />4)Rules- This another awesome song. Kind of a ballad/rock song. <br />5/5 stars<br />5)The One- This song would be good, but it's too slow. It's so slow, it's not enjoyable to listen too.<BR>3/5 stars<br />6)Ready For The Good Times- A fun party song that's great to listen to.<BR>5/5<br />7)Fool- This is definately one of my favorites on the album.

B00005OCMR|4.0|Excellent  Sci-fi movie, was way before it's time.  A must see film!
B00005N9CV|3.0|The liner notes on the CD are filled with sexy pictures and offer no information about the music.  Get the idea about the performer's biggest talents?  Marginal, nothing new.
B000002LQR|5.0|i borrowed the cd from my guitar teacher, wore it out then threatened to keep it. i love, love love this album. all are very diverse. breaking the girl, was a single, beautiful song.  sir phsyco sexy is rather humourous, suck my kiss is a great fast paced song, I could have lied is a ballad of sorts, but a great one and maybe one of their best songs ever.  my lovely man is a favourite, such an unsual thing for a bunch of guys to pull off, and of course under the bridge the biggest upon big beautiful ballad with exqusite lyrics, thier big hit.  then give it away- a wonderful guitar riff every single second. everything else is good too.
B00005QIPH|4.0|Hmmm...a while since I've written a review and I might well just type ... here.  But this album is very good, so I had to write something.  Well, I bought it in the first place to be a bit of a fashion ...; album to put on the coffee table.  But...it's very good.  Not over-produced American rock (thank God, don't care if it's a gimmick, I want mistakes, feedback etc), good delivery - spirit, good songs - not over-produced, good riffs, spirit of 77 hiding in there...they're self consciously cool, yeah...but we want our rock bands to be cool don't we? Bit of posing is encouraged by me, so long as they stay...fairly punky. They don't want to believe their hype, or go too big time.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I think this movie deserves it's &quot;movie of the year nomination.&quot;All about the Boheamean Revolution, truth, beauty, freedom, and love.The acting was great!The singing was even better, I didn't even know Kidman could sing, very good too.The costumes were very detailed and amazing.The coreography deserves an award of it's own, with the thrilling can-can to the love betraing tango.A must have-must see kind of movie.
B00003CXWV|5.0|This movie was a great experience.  Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz, Paul Rubens, and all of the supporting cast members did an excellent job in portraying the lifestyle their characters were living.  This is a true story of Americas most infamous cocaine dealer, George Jung.  In about 2 hours of time you see the rise and fall of this legendary man.  The director also deserves a hand.  The way this movie was filmed really gave you a good piece of what was happening in his life, but left some things in the dark, which made the movie all the more intriging.  This movie shows the roller coaster type of life George Jung had at an interesting perspective.  All of the massive massive amounts of drug dealing that was going on didnt seem like the works of a hardcore street hustler, but like the works of a man with ambition.  All of the actors did a great job of potraying how drugs, power, and lots of money can effect people.  An excellent flick.
B00005QCVY|5.0|I love this movie and it's a Christmas tradition to watch it with as many of my five kids as I can get together. It has helped me through some pretty tough times.<br />As a young boy in the 50s and 60s I grew up watching old movies on television with my mother. Jimmy Stewart has always been my favorite actor, not in any small measure because of this movie. It was my mother's fondness for him that initially led me to this great discovery. Having my own roots in a small community of western Pennsylvania, only 60 miles from Jimmy's hometown, helped to cement my affinity for him as well. I'm such a big fan of both him and this work that a copy of an original poster for this film hangs in my living room.<br />One of my greatest regrets is that, despite my exposure to what were even then &quot;old&quot; movies during my youth, I hadn't yet seen &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; when I had the opportunity of meeting both director Frank Capra AND actor Jimmy Stewart on separate occasions while in college. I would have liked to have told them how much the movie meant to me. (As if they hadn't heard that before!) I found great pleasure in later learning that both Capra and Stewart said of all their movies, this one was their favorite.<br />Moving and inspiring the film is a human drama that touches my funny bone and my innermost senses in ways few movies ever do. It's an all-American timeless classic with a message of personal struggle and hope. In all it's simplicity it is simply great entertainment while at the same time leaving us no doubt as to the essential truth of what's *really* important in life.<br />Yes it's a bit sappy, certainly sentimental. Yes it's in black and white (unless you happen to see the &quot;colorized &quot; version) and granted it's an &quot;oldie,&quot; but if you don't like this movie I can only have pity for you.<br />We all matter. We all have purpose. Despite what we might think at times, it IS a wonderful life and we have much to be thankful for.<br />&quot;Each man's life touches so many other lives. If he wasn't around, it would leave an awful hole.&quot; -- Clarence<br />At least that's the way we should all live and hope it shall be.or.<br />&quot;Each man's life touches so many other lives. If he wasn't around, it would leave an awful hole.&quot; -- Clarence<br />At least that's the way we should all live and hope it shall be.
B00003CXTG|4.0|This is a very intertaining movie about life as it was in 1941 before we were plunged into war. It's a love story set against the backdrop of military service in the Pacific theater. The costumes and characters are magnificent and capture the attitudes of that time. If you are looking for a documentary account of Pearl Harbor, then look to A &amp; E or The Discovery Channel. If you are wanting to be entertained for a couple of hours, then this movie is for you. If you want facts, get a book on the subject. There are plenty available at your local library.
B00005JKT8|3.0|Okay, so it's full of holes.  Leopold, who leaps into present day New York City from the Manhattan of 1876, is somehow able to sing lyrics from the Pirates of Penzance (which premiered in 1879), debate about the opera La Boheme (written in 1896), and garbs himself in a topcoat more appropriate to an officer in the Napoleonic wars than to Victorian-era English aristocracy.  But one doesn't argue the weight of a soufflé, and if one craves light entertainment, it is there to be found in this movie.  For better or for worse, the appeal of this film relies nearly completely on the wonderful performance of Hugh Jackman.  His Leopold is a lovely creation:  full of dignity, charm, humor and resourcefulness (and it doesn't hurt that he's drop-dead gorgeous).  You never doubt for a moment that you are in the presence of a flesh-and-blood character, and as all fine actors do, he leaves you wanting more.  He alone carries the question at the heart of the film:  what price would a modern girl pay for a man like Leopold, and how far would she go to have him?<br />It's Meg Ryan's dilemma, and if Meg Ryan weren't so inflexibly Meg Ryan in her performance, there would have been a real story to hook on to.  She wears her role like a familiar old coat - viewers will recognize the same cavalcade of gestures from any other of her films of this genre.  Yes, they've been successful for her, but I would have loved to see her truly open up as an actress and show me something more, as Jackman did.  I can't help but wonder what the film would have been like with a Barbara Stanwyck or a Margaret Sullavan at the helm.  <br />The supporting actors are fine, if underutilized, particularly Breckin Meyer as Kate's younger brother, an aspiring actor.  His scenes with Leopold are the heart and soul of the film, which is telling.  Director James Mangold's depiction of old New York was visually fascinating, and felt far truer than the world of contemporary Manhattan he created.
B00000JCOV|5.0|My favorite band now. It just blows you away. If you ignore the 1st track numbers 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 11 and the bonus track 15 will all become your favorite songs. If you dont have the cd go get it now. I MEAN IT NOW!

B00005U11Z|5.0|Since the 70's, I've always enjoyed Journey.  The musicianship and songwriting have always been first-rate.  Also, I can't help but be a little biased, since Jonathan Cain himself played &quot;Faithfully&quot; during my wedding ceremony back in '93.  We also exchange Christmas cards every year, and there are even some dedications to my wife and me in the liner notes of one of his solo albums.<br />That being said, I was still prepared to view this DVD with a very critical eye.  I hadn't heard the new &quot;Steve&quot; in the band, and as a musician who specializes in vocals, my laser vision was well trained on Mr. Augeri.<br />Well, any reservations that I might have had were completely unfounded.  As much as I have enjoyed Steve Perry's singing in the past, his live performances sometimes suffered a little compared with the recordings, which is usually only natural, considering the challenging nature of this material.<br />Steve Augeri, on the other hand, consistently performed so closely to the original recordings that I kept checking for tell-tale signs of post-production dubbing.  I didn't find any, so I have to conclude that, yes Virginia, this is a true live performance.  He is relaxed, confident, and is obviously enjoying himself, the band, and the audience.  Occasionally, there is minor straining or thinning of his voice at or beyond high-E, but unless you are specifically looking for it, you won't notice it.  The only real negative comment that I can think of is that his stage patter still needs a little work.  Personally, it annoys me when a singer keeps asking how everybody is doing, or if everyone is &quot;having a good time&quot;.  Yes, we're all doing great and enjoying the show, thank you.  Can we move on, now?<br />And moving on to Dean Castronovo, I've been a fan of his playing since he was drumming with various Shrapnel Records artists over ten years ago, so hearing him play with Journey was quite a treat.  I think that Steve Smith is a great drummer, but I personally like Dean's more aggressive double-bass work in that he manages to wring a harder-rocking sensibility out of the older material, and outright shred on the new stuff.<br />What can be said about Neil, except that like a fine wine, he does get better with age.  His stint as a solo artist seems to have refined his chops to the point of true guitar heroism, which he brings back into the Journey fold with a vengeance.  Also, his guitar tone is even more liquid and &quot;sustainy&quot; than ever, allowing him to really sing with his guitar.<br />Ross Valory's work is tight and crisp.  On my second viewing of the DVD, I paid particular attention to the rhythm section, and was pleased at how consistently &quot;on&quot; he is playing.  Tonally, he seems to be going for a more modern, punchier, and less boomy sound.  This only adds to the perception of crispness in the bass, and the music overall.  Like another reviewer, I also noticed that although he seemed to be having fun, he was very focused, and I would dare say that he was somewhat of a &quot;hub&quot; to the music.<br />Last but not least, Jonathan Cain was superb, as always.  His keyboard and piano work were very consistent in this performance, and his solo piece was a well-executed interlude to bridge the gap between a more raucous song and a ballad.  He seemed to be enjoying himself immensely, and another great aspect of this performance is the way that Jonathan enhanced some of his old parts, making them more interesting, and adding more flavor to some of the old songs.  Finally, knowing what songs that he wrote, or helped to write, I can only say that Journey would not have had such massive success without Jonathan's contributions.<br />Aside from Steve Augeri's lead vocals, Journey was especially astounding on this DVD because of the rich background vocals that sometimes expanded to four parts because everyone in the band was singing.  I heard one section where two members were singing harmony &quot;ooohs&quot;, while two more were singing the main lyric in harmony, while Steve Augeri sang some answering lines based on the main lyric.  This is really great stuff that allows the band to sound just like the original recordings.<br />Oh, and of course the DVD video and audio quality is terrific.  I don't have a 5.1 system, but it sure does sound great through my stereo.  Even though this DVD has a minimum of special features, with the great sound, high video quality, and tight editing, this is one of the more well-produced music DVDs that I own.  Special thanks go to whoever decided to skip the use of video FX.  When I watch a concert on video, I want to see a great performance and nothing else.  This DVD delivers just that.
B00003CXTG|5.0|PEARL HARBOR still remains the best film released in the year 2001. Not only does it present the stories of the men and women who served at Pearl Harbor on that fateful day in December accurately (and adding a glimmer of humanity with a well-crafted fictional romance story kicked into the mix), but, in the wake of the September 11th attacks, America needs stories like this: seeing people who saw a tragic event take place, but they are able to move on to great glory, as we assuredly will. It is also great to see the best film of 2001 receive a lavish 2-Disc release. The film itself looks incredible in 2.35:1 Widescreen, and has four different sound options. The two documentaries are well-crafted and dramatic (A fifty-minute behind the scenes feature and the History Channel Documentary \\"Unsung Heroes of Pearl Harbor\\"). It also features two stirring Theatrical Trailers, a preview of National Geographic's PEARL HARBOR: BEYOND THE MOVIE, and the music video to Faith Hill's exceptional song \\"There You'll Be.\\" Anyone who loves films and DVD Videos will find this a great addition to their collection. I guarantee it! Grade: A+
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Everyone is a critic in today's time of the internet.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I honestly don't know how anyone could not love this movie, unless you are some kind of grinch who can't stand love stories...<br />Personally, I thought Ewan McGregor has a great voice, and I can't immagine anyone else filling the role, not Tom Hanks, not Tom Cruise, not even Brad Pitt.  Not to mention that Ewan is pure eye candy.<br />This DVD is truly astonishing, from the special features to the crisp video playback.  Definately a movie that needs to be in everyone's collection.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|WOW, I loved it.<BR>They trained Angelina Jolie very hard for this movie. She actually did most of her stunts.<br />Tomb Raider isn't just any kind of women Superhero, she's Lara croft, a beautiful, strong, intelligent women. The adventure is electrifying and outstanding during the hole movie.<br />YOU WILL LOVE IT, especially if you had the chance to play the video-games.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|&quot;Poses&quot; is an incredibly lyrical work from Rufus Wainwright. Revealing haunting melodies and completely original songwriting, its compositions have such a classic ring that you swear that you have heard them before (or you wonder how you could not have). His voice is a mix between Paul McCartney and Thom York (Radiohead), his arrangements are perfectly orchestrated....light and subdued on the instrumentals, with the vocals taking center stage.<br />To see this quality of work coming from a 23 year old artist makes me wonder if we are looking at the next Elton John.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I think this movie was reinacted very well, the real footage that is displayed was of great taste. It brings to thought what can happen, especially with our world the way it is right now. It is not only good from the historic aspect but the love story side also. Ben Affleck is a great actor!!

B00005QZ7U|5.0|Oh my god, I cannot belive this film. It is one of the most incredibly visual, stunning and nonstop feast for the eyes of a film that I have almost ever seen in my 37 years! The music (undeniably not for everyone--sure wouldn't bring my mom and dad!) is incredible, the dance scenes intoxicating. I personally feel all who contributed to this film were geniuses for their vision. I though Ewan McGregor's voice was beautiful and same as Nicoles'. Who cares if they aren't 'professional' singers? It is like you are listening to Roseanne Barr singing..! Anyway, it's a glorious mix of high energy dancing, can can, singing, sadness and love. I just keep replaying certain scenes and can't get it out of my mind.
B000002JNJ|5.0|This was Pantera's first album you can find in stores. They released other albums of a totally different style before this, but they are very hard to find. This album is a bit different from Pantera's later stuff. There is less of that growl and at times on this album, Phil even sounds like Rob Halford. If you're waitin' for these guys to make another &quot;Cowboys From Hell&quot;, it's not gonna happen, cuz now Phil doesn't sing, he just screams. Sorry. Best songs here are &quot;Primal Concrete Sledge&quot;, &quot;Psycho Holiday&quot;, &quot;Domination&quot;, and &quot;Message In Blood&quot;.
B00001IVOF|5.0|You may need a rewind button to hear a verse again or make sure you understood it properly.  This album is a hip hop classic and is lyrically better than &quot;The Infamous&quot;.  &quot;Infamous&quot; got the Mobb on the hip hop scene but all real Mobb listeners know pound for pound Hell on Earth is lyrically the better album.  Mainly because of the improvement in Havoc's lyrics.  More Trife Life Is actually a Havoc solo track, It's a brilliant storytelling type track.  Prodigy seems to have got a lot smarter, his rhymes are more vivid and P has just grown as a lyricist in all.  Prodigy's incredible lyrical abilities especially stood out on &quot;Nightime Vultures&quot;, G.O.D pt3, &quot;Hell on Earth&quot;, &quot;Still Shinin' and &quot;Apostle's Warning&quot; but his lyrics are not weak on any track.
6305736650|5.0|First of all: Mister &quot; thebadgercarlton &quot;, Widescreen wasn't invented yet in 1942!<BR>Fullscreen is the only original ratio for Casablanca.<br />Casablanca is one of the greatest films ever and the DVD is good, but the film really needs restoration, especially<BR>in scene No 13.
0345350499|5.0|This is one book that you really want to read if you are a follower of pagan ways. This book gives an accurate description (in my mind) of how pagans worship and live, and least how I feel they did/do. <BR>I bought this book almost 7 years ago and have managed to read it 30 times at least. (a great feat for college student and new mom!)<BR>It's worth the time and the money!!
B000002HPV|4.0|Sure the weird voice, unique lyrics, and all the electronic beats are still their, but this is a much more different sound than any of Bjork's previous works.  <br />In Homogenic, the songs are darker, the lyrics are chilly, and they're just a whole lot different than the vibrant, colorful, and rollercoaster-like emotions of the songs on Post, (which, might i add, was a fantastic introduction to bjork's music). I don't know what was happening during this period of her life, but she certainly wasn't overflowing with joy. Don't get me wrong, Homogenic is really, really good, but I sure did have to get used to it.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Okay, I'll admit it, at first I was a bit skeptical about the new Britney Spears album, especially after hearing her first single, &quot;I'm A Slave For You.&quot; After listening to it, I realize that this is her best one yet. From her emotional &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman,&quot; to her coming of age &quot;Overprotected&quot; and &quot;Let Me Be,&quot; this album is a must have for any Britney fan.
B00000490M|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  It's exciting, fun  and full of life.  A classic for all ages and times!!!
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Best CD since Counting Crow's August and Everything After.
6302824729|5.0|I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this film.  It's got that wonderful blend of action, excitement, and fun in a story.  It kept me on the edge of my chair the entire time.  The plot is just brilliant. Mr. Miyagi and Daniel have their budding courtships, which were a pleasure to experience with the characters.  But then there are the &quot;conflicting&quot; stories with our two main characters, each with their suited adversary.  I liked the ending to Mr. Miyagi's story, the fact that it didn't have to end in violence.  And I REALLY liked the end fight with Daniel and Toshio, not only for the action and fighting aspect, but when Daniel got that focused invincible fighting thing going, I was like, &quot;Yeah, Daniel.  You go boy!!&quot;  Any audience member who was with Daniel throughout this movie just LOVED this moment.  THAT is what a movie should do for the audience.  Just wonderful all around.  FUN, FUN, FUN!!  ACTION, ACTION, ACTION!!  And good story writing to back it all up.  Please buy this, it's good.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|There is no other actor that is Robin Hood! Errol Flynn plays his part to perfection, as do all the players in the only version worth watching.<br />The first time I remember seeing this film my father took me to a screening at the Museum of Art in Los Angeles, a fitting venue, that was 30 years ago.<br />I have since had the pleasure of seeing it on the big screen a few more times, and was even able to meet Errol's daughter at one a couple of years back.<br />There have been many reproductions, and in fact Robin Hood was first played on film by Douglas Fairbanks, but none comes close to the perfection of Errol Flynn's version.<br />Basil Rathbone is the perfect villian, and at the time one of the best if not the best swordsman in Hollywood, I have heard that he gave Errol a few pointers?? Another perfect bit of casting went to the poor guy who looses the archery tournament to Robin, the guy who get's his arrow split by Robin is the stunt archer on the film and made the split shot himself, this was not a stunt but a real shot, and if you look close you can see that the arrow is not split in two but three! Also, every time you see someone hit with an arrow, it's this same person shooting them with a real bow and arrow from off camera!! Some pretty brave day players on this film.<br />What else can I say but to take the time to enjoy this film, and share it with the next generation. This film stands up still to the best action and adventure films of today, with perfect casting, great music, direction and cinematography.<br />I can't recomend this film enough to everyone.<br />And listen close to the dialog, there are many gems, scripted and otherwise.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I liked Romeo + Juliet and hoped that next Lurmann's picture wouldn't be worse. And it wasn't.<br />It's very original musical and there are a lot of things about this side of the film, but...<br />This is a story of love. Young poet and courtesan. Their life. Their fate. Their love. Above everything - there is only one thing. And it is love. The main thing in the world. And it is beautiful and light feeling even if it is a tragical love. Romeo + Juliet was about it. Moulin Rouge! was about it. And it is so great that in our pragmatic and cynical world there are people who understand, that<BR>         ALL WE NEED IS LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKHP|4.0|After seeing this movie twice back in 1979 I had mixed feelings. Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack and the visual effects rushed together by Douglas Trumball were just jaw dropping. I still feel this movie has the best storyline of any trek film though it did come at the expense of some of the characters.<br />At times, it appeared this film was to become the black sheep of the trek universe. With each new trek film it seemed more people began to shun the first film as a waste. Something to be forgotten. A few even said StarTrek V was a better movie.<br />Imagine my surprise when the director's cut DVD appears. Beautifully mastered, letterboxed, reworked/added sound effects, cleaned up visual effects, new visual effects, added scenes, long sequences &quot;tightened&quot; up without destroying the pacing of the musical track. On Disc 2 is a lot of filler material which fills out the package nicely though the only part of interest to me was seeing actual footage from Star Trek: Phase 2 whose pilot episode became the first Trek movie.<br />If you didn't like the film when it was released in '79, I don't expect this DVD to change your mind. Those who did enjoy it will find even more reasons to enjoy it with the DVD Director's Cut.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|There are a lot of negative reviews about this film. Too much. Well, of course, it isn't a masterpiece or all-time classics, but...<br />I had never played Tomb Raider before I saw this movie. So I have nothing to compare 1st Lara with. And It is good.<br />This picture isn't intelligent, it's not original, but IT IS REALLY FUN. It's such a pleasure to watch it. Angie is so beautiful. Her father is great actor. Music is fast and cool. Story is interesting. Fightings are great. Boom! Bah!!! Bdgggggg!!!!! Tysch!!!!!!! Clutssss!!!!!!!!!<br />It is good funny movie. Just for the rest. Nothing more. I'm waiting for 2nd part and hope it'll be even better than the 1st.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This is max. This cd is wonderful, great, magnifesent and beutiful. It's the best I have ever heard since I don't know. I love it checkand see for your self. they do have samples. go check now. You'le love it.
0802130208|4.0|~My wife had been nagging me to read this book, but I had been delaying for years.  Quite frankly, who would be interested in a book that seems to have replaced the traditional protagonist with an extremely obnoxious antagonist?  Finally, I took it with me on an airplane flight--it's the perfect length for such trips.  As many of the other reviewers have commented, Ignatius is brilliant.  He's the lazy misantropic intellectual in all of us.  And, Ignatius is not the only brilliant~~ characterization.  By the end of the novel, I found myself cheering for exactly the opposite people of when I started the book.  Mr. Levy, the lazy CEO of Levy pants, starts a villian and ends a sympathetic semi-hero, while his wife, the protector of the old company clerk Miss Trixie and proponent of the undertrodden's self esteem, slowly turns from a heroine of the underdog to a self-involved women whose only reason for her ability to torture the poor clerk is her marriage to the CEO.  Other~~ characters make similar flips.  I enjoyed this book--maybe I'll go start the book again right now. . . .~
B00005OWIU|5.0|This is max. This cd is wonderful, great, magnifesent and beutiful. I would give it 95 more stars. It's the best I have ever heard since I don't know. I love it checkand see for your self. they do have samples. go check now. You'le love it.
B00005OM4N|2.0|Just look at the picture on the CD. The image she conveys to the teenagers throughout the world that listen to her music is becoming worse. The innocence of the \\"Baby One More Time\\" album is lost, and an indescribable feeling of disgust swells over me at the sight of fashion styles on the front cover.<br />It should be noted that her music is also degrading in quality. The tunes that delivered a message and could be hummed repeatedly in her first album have evolved to the newer songs including \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" that deliver no message (poor lyrics). Britney's a great dancer, but if the music seems bland, it's very important to ask yourself a question whether you're buying: because of her publicity and image or because you truly like the music.<br />Folks, this album has hit blank space. Her voice in this album definitely lacks the resonance of previous albums, and I strongly do not suggest this. A true blow to pop culture.
B00005QZWI|4.0|Hello this is Max. I gave this soundtrack a 4 star because it was mostly good. Very litle was bad. but you should choose yourself there are samples.
B00003CXSP|4.0|As a film sequel, HANNIBAL was bound to disappoint many of its customers.  It is stylistically very different from its legendary forebear, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  The older film is a sober precedural mystery-thriller with a seductive monster central to the plot.  The sequel is a stylish celebration of that very monster, self-consciously humorous and departing boldly from the Thomas Harris novel.  The crucial role of Clarice Starling is played by another actor, and with &quot;Hannibal the Cannibal&quot; free of his jail cell and endowed with an almost supernatural intellect and power, we tread some dangerously campy territory where Hopkins says &quot;goody-goody&quot; and the fans giggle with glee.<br />The DVD's features help one to appreciate how well-made and well-acted the film truly is.  Investigate director Ridley Scott's commentary on some of the deleted scenes, the film itself, and the alternate ending they shot.  It is most educational.  The &quot;making of&quot; documentary is mostly self-adoring, but there is interesting information in there as well.  One comes to appreciate how carefully made the film is, and what a challenge it was to film this story and make a credible movie.  Thomas Harris may even have set them a challenge that was impossible, especially with the infamous dinner scene. <br />Finally, I appreciate the ending of the film far more than the far-reaching conclusion of the novel.  The film's script brings Agent Starling and Hannibal together in a confrontation which tests Starling's integrity and courage, and Hannibal's ultimate admiration of this &quot;deep roller.&quot;  So much so, that he makes a painful sacrifice to preserve his own freedom and fly away.
B000024D4R|5.0|Choosing a band's best album can be difficult when the band has created as many gems as Pink Floyd has.  In my opinion, Animals is the best Pink Floyd album both musically and lyrically.  The variety of sounds from tracks like Pigs on the Wing to Dogs is staggering.  Throw in the dark lyrics and equally dark atmosphere created by the production and you have an amazing album from start to finish without a single weak link.  If you are a Floyd fan then you already own this.  Planning on trying your first Pink Floyd album...this would not be a bad place to start.
6303477259|3.0|First of all I LOVE PINK FLOYD! That is why the Delicate Sound of Thunder video left a long impression on me when I first watched it some years ago. I think David Gilmour's vocals are fresher in DSoT than in Pulse.  Also, the backing vocals singers sound better (and are extremely good looking as a bonus to the viewer). They also seemed to be enjoying the music as much as the members of the band.  I am greatful that Pulse has the live concert version of Dark Side of the Moon and is always a pleasure to hear the sounds and music of this great album (my first of Pink Floyd). I saw Pink Floyd in concert at Soldier Field in Chicago when they toured for the Division Bell album.  Unfortunately, it was not the best venue to see a concert.  The Pulse video is definitely a better way for me to appreciate Pink Floyd for what it is. Now I have in my collection other early works by this magnificent band.  If you do not have DSoT video, I would recommend to buy it. It would be a good companion to Pulse. I would love to see the DVD or video version of The Wall live concert.  I think the CD version of The Wall live concert is just fantastic. Every time I listed to this CD I dream of being there.  Any chance to have The Wall live concert on DVD?
B00003CXQY|4.0|A very misleading trailer.  I thought this was going to be a goofy, Animaniac-like cartoon romp.  I never saw it until I rented it for my kids.  It was far from a masterpiece in story telling or character development, but it is truly one of the funniest Disney films to date.  David Spade, John Goodman, and Patrick Warburton turn in extremely hilarious voice performances of their characters, especially Warburton's angel/devil act. It is lighter than the average Disney, but still ends on the usual morale high note. Kids will love it anyway because it's animated, but adults will find it unusually funny for Disney. One piece of advice - the Ultimate 2 Disc Edition does not provide much more than the cheaper version if you want to save money on the DVD.
B00005LOUP|5.0|I found Jim Carrey to be delightfully entertaining.  I think he has shown once again how versatile a character actor he is.<BR>I also found all the characters equally entertaining.  Especially Cindy Lou winning over the Grinch.<br />I enjoyed the interpretation of how the Grinch came to dislike Christmas.  I am sure any number of story lines would have worked, but this was very pleasant and entertaining.<br />This is pure entertainment.  Open your heart, I have long been a Grinch fan, and I think this fits along with the original to be treasured through the years.  How could your heart not grow two sizes?  Unless your the Grinch.
B00005U11Z|4.0|For any of you who DIDN'T think Journey still existed, or refuse to accept a Perryless Journey, THINK AGAIN! After watching (and listening) to the first few songs in 5.1 surround sound, It won't take long to convince you, that Journey is still as INCREDIBLE as ever, doing what they do best, PLAYING LIVE, for their audience. Lead vocalist, Steve Augeri takes Journey to a new level. He performs the classic material flawlessly, with a great deal of admiration and respect. You might say he has taken those songs under his belt, and calls them his own. Steve HAD a tough void to fill, and he HAS done so, remarkably!  New drummer Deen Castronovo adds some hard driving flare to the Journey beat, and it sounds amazing! Founding Journeyman Neal Schon just tears it up with his incredible, innovative axe work! He's on my top 5 list, of all time greatest guitarists! Jonathan Cain's superb, masterful keys and Ross Valory's pounding bass lines round out this amazingly talented group of musicians! This DVD is a must have for anyone who appreciates great music and great musicianship! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars, is that they didn't include enough new material from their awesome new CD, ARRIVAL. While shopping, be sure to add this to your cart, too!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|After Time Out Of Mind I figured that we had heard the last and the best from Bob Dylan.  Iam his biggest fan and have followed him since 1973.  His music is always interesting and eclectic enough to hear something new with repeated listenings.  Bob shows a side here that is very blue/bluegrass oriented.  The final song makes me cry and the whole album is like a condensend version of The Anthology Of American Folk Music.   I hope Bob will be around for many years because he brings a certain joy to music that no one else does.  One of the top 10 of 2001
B00005PJ8O|5.0|George C. Scott's portrayal of General George S. Patton is outstanding in capturing the essense of the man; so much so that one thinks of Scott when considering the historic Patton!  Scott's deep voice better fits the profane and volcanic nature of the General, who was &quot;blessed&quot; with a high and squeaky voice!  A classic war film that provides great entertainment with each viewing.  That said, I must take exception with a reviewer who lauded the film's accuracy.  It is anything but historically accurate.  The overall timeline is correct, but anyone who has read a book on Patton (especially the &quot;Patton Papers&quot;) will spot the dramatic license taken by the Hollywood producers.  Just to name a few: Patton knew that he would command Third Army before he left the Mediteranean for England.  In the film, he wasn't told until after D-Day!  Another: the entire exchange between Patton and Montgomery in Messina was fabricated; as was the competition between the two for Messina.  This said, &quot;Patton&quot; remains one of my favorite movies, and I recommend it to anyone.  Just have that book ready on the coffee table (also available from Amazon!)
B00005QK3W|5.0|When I first heard this I didnt like it that much.  I thought it was great that Paul had gone back to recording and performing and that he was still alive and vital after his dear Lind's death a few years ago.  Driving Rain grows on you.  I,ve now heard it about 6 times and I would compare it with Band On The Run as a classic offering from Sir Paul.  The capper of the CD is the song Freedom performed onstage at Madison Square Garden to a very enthuastic audience.  There are many different sounding songs on this album which I find very refreshing.  Driving Rain has a story to tell about matters of the heart and not in quite awhile has Paul let his soul stand bare as he does here.   It is a must buy
B000002U9E|5.0|If I was strand on a desert island, and had to choose one CD this would be it. Eerie, surreal and penetrating even after sixteen years of listening to it. <br />As many reviews have pointed to this is a concept album; the first side deals with unconditional love from various points of view. The second side (called the ninth wave) deals with dreaming, hallucinations, and death. This album has many layers, from powerful imagery to intoxicating musical atmospheres to eye-opening philosophical lyrics. <br />EMI also reissued this CD with six bonus tracks, which were not included in the first release. Although only available on import, the track \\"Under the Ivy\\" is worth the price justification. Other Bonus tracks include: The Big Sky (meteorigical mix), Running Up That Hill (12' mix), Be Kind To My Mistakes, Burning Bridge, and My Lagan Love. <br />A Masterpiece!!
B000002OCP|3.0|For some people this album just does not work, but for me it's an unappreciated classic.  Frankly, it is neither a blues nor a rock album - it's more like a \\"psychadelic soul blues\\" record.  The purists hate it (and claim that Muddy did, too) but if you can manage to listen to the story that the American Routes radio program did on this record, you will get a better appreciation for it.  The musicians backing Muddy on these sessions are the same guys who played with Chicago soul artists like Curtis Mayfield and also on some Motown records - they were simply the best session musicians working on urban black music at the time.  <BR>     I think you will also get a better appreciation for it if you listen with an open mind and recognize that it's going to be a different experience than say \\"Muddy Waters, The Real Folk Blues\\".  Consider it to be more closely related to things like the Jimi Hendrix song \\"Red House\\".   Really, there's only one bad cut: Muddy's version of the Stones' \\"Let's Spend The Night Together\\".<br />By the way, I saw Muddy play a number of times in the '60s and on  several occasions he performed a portion of his set in the style of Electric Mud.
B00004R7TP|5.0|Even without the extra tracks, this album is worth at least five stars.  However, even if you already own the original, it's worth plunking down a few extra bucks for the bonus tracks.<br />'The Big Sky Meterogical Mix' is really fun, creative remix with different voice-overs added.  The 'Running up that Hill' remix is also more than decent though I admit I like the original better.<br />'Be Kind to My Mistakes' is a sweet song about when you love someone you have to accept their blemishes along with the rest.  'Under the Ivy' is a gorgeous and sentimental piece -- it's one of my favorite Kate songs ever.  Also, her piano playing really gets to shine on this track.<br />'My Lagan Love' is a beatiful a cappella piece -- the music is taken from an original Irish/Scottish folk song and Kate's brother wrote the words.  'Burning Bridge' is an upbeat pop tune with great vocals.<br />It's really nice to have all these rare tracks together (ligitly) on one CD.  If you are a real Kate fan you can do what I did - resell your original copy on amazon and buy this one for the bonus tracks.
B00005JKMO|5.0|Let me begin by saying I love Muhammad Ali. I know the man's career backwards and forwards while asleep. I have read many a book and seen many a film clip. My standards for authenticity in film and in life are high. In short, I was watching this film with my keen eye and fine tooth comb at the ready. My Opinion? <br />They nailed this baby! Will Smith gives the performance of a lifetime with his own brand of charisma, while not equalling Ali sized proportions, is enough to carry the day and then some in this film. The hairs on my body occasionally stood on in.(My personal litmus test)<br />His preparation, exhaustive(35 pounds, A nuerologist, speech therapist, Hundreds of rounds boxing, 10 months in training to transform his body and mind, countless dinners and phone calls with insiders) and the benefit and blessings of actual participants assistance and pertinent information(He once had Ali's trainer, Angelo Dundee actually tape his hands for a scene, Boxing with Sugar Ray Leonard), Mr. Smith delivers and is worthy of nominations.<br />Providing the perfect curriculum for success, Director Michael Mann, with keen and artistic decision making,(great locations, real in-fighting(no stunt doubles),fight choreography from the actual bouts,) provides cohesive support along with credible performances {and incredible, John Voight as Howard Cosell} by nearly every actor involved, helping to make this film thoroughly enjoyable to every facet of emotion. <br />Mr. Smith, go pick out a tuxedo. You're going to need one for the Oscars.

B00005JKT8|5.0|My friend and I just went to see Kate and Leopold. CUTE MOVIE! I had never heard of Hugh Jackman, but I feel he will become a huge star with Meg Ryan as his co-star. After doing a net search and asking the question, &quot;Who is Hugh Jackman?&quot;, I found out other movies he had been in. I have already been to the movie store to rent &quot;Swordfish&quot;. Nothing against Meg Ryan, but Hugh Jackman made the movie.  <BR>It was kind of corny in the sense it involved time travel. However, for a truly enjoyable movie without the intense action or plot, it is a winner!<BR>It was a definate chick flick, but I liked it!<BR>I would buy the video!
6300214559|3.0|Historically, \\"Lady Jane\\" is a piece of ...[garbage]. The real Jane was much more of a pawn than the film suggests and Jane and Guilford hated each other. That being said, if you overlook the fact that if you ever use this film as a basis for an historical essay about Jane you will get an F, it is a lovely romantic story. It was Helena Bonham Carter's first film and even then it was clear that she had a great future ahead of her. The chemistry between Bonham Carter and Cary Elwes was magical. The sets and costumes were magnificent.
B000000OSG|5.0|The song Civil War is worth it alone to get this album. It sends chills down your spine (yes, it is that good, especially at the end of the song, Axl calmly states &quot;What's so civil about war anyway?&quot;) This one is MUCH better than UTI 1, the songs are just more beautiful. I wouldn't mind comparing this to Appetite for Destruction. Thats all you need to know.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is an excellent film.  What makes it excellent is not its songs nor the voices that sing them, not its plot, not the actors nor their performances.  The songs are reworkings of classic pop tunes, and the voices are decent enough for anyone except those expecting professionally trained vocalists (at least it isn't dubbed!).  The plot and its execution are patchworks of cliches: boy falls in love, loses girl, gets girl, tragedy strikes; lowly writer wins the love of &quot;high&quot; and beautiful courtesan.  This film's spectacular accomplishment is the combining of film AND musical theater cliches into a cohesive whole in a way that, to my knowledge, has never been done before.  In theater, it is impossible to change settings in the course of a song as many times as they do - the rendition of &quot;Roxanne&quot; is particularly brilliant in this respect.  In the movies, where everything is &quot;believability,&quot; it is difficult to get away with the overdone acting that is characteristic of this film.  The transitions between dialogue and song are often much smoother than in theater (except in the beginning, where it is intentional), as if one were simply weaving a thread of musical theater into and out of the film.<br />The principle on which the movie was built seems to be an over-the-top representation of both genres: the close-ups are, at times, outrageous; the classic musical numbers are exaggerated (see the &quot;Can-can&quot; or &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;); the scenes in the Moulin Rouge are often enormously disorienting to the point of disrupting one's sense of space and time; the acting is intentionally overdone to the point of melodrama.  <br />All of these techniques create an atmosphere in which sincere, straightforward emotion have no place.  But when such emotions ARE expressed, they are set in such high relief against the rest of the film that the viewer forgets that they are &quot;cliche&quot; or as old as time.  And that ability to do that isnothing short of brilliant.
0345448898|5.0|Grown-up verision of Harry Potter, which I loved also.  <BR>Some complicated theroy for children, but not to complicated for the very bright.  Very thought prevoking, and interesting.  I say let Hollywood make a movie out of this Triogy.  I  would love to see that.
0380973650|5.0|An awesome mix of fantasy in a reality setting, multi-layered plots and a good mix of action, suspense and fantasy elements. I am a role-player gamer and find it an invaluable resource for inspiration. If you are a fantasy fan, you will love it. If you are a mythology buff you will love it also. There was only one place in the middle where the story tended to lag, but it wasn't enough to cost it a star in my rating.<br />Highly recommended, highly praised!
B00005JKES|5.0|For those of you who wondered why the pilot was not a part of this release, the pilot is owned by another production company.  Hopefully, the pilot will be released some day... <br />With or without the pilot, the first season of Twin Peaks is excellent.  The DVDs are so crystal clear and the sound is great (5.1 DTS).  You can really appreciate the ones directed by Lynch.  They are outstanding.
B00005LOUS|3.0|Jim Carey is in his usual form in this movie.  Not a bad movie for the kids either.
B00005QDW1|2.0|I've heard &quot;Hey Baby&quot; on the radio and absolutely love the song.<br />However after listening to the samples of the other songs online, I surely won't pay the bucks for this CD.<br />Of course the durations of the samples leave a lot to be desired.<br />But what should I do -- hope for the best?  Nah, I'll save my money and &quot;maybe&quot; buy the single if/when it comes out.  That is doubtful as well.  I don't like an entire CD platter for a single song even if it's great.<br />VERY INTERESTING that they have used CDs for sale when this thing was only released a few days ago.
6300270424|4.0|Led Zeppelin was the greatest hard rock band anybody has ever seen. They produced an extraordinary amount of material within a decade. This was best examplified when Jimmy Page released the humongous 'Led Zeppelin' box set in 1990. In &quot;The Song Remains the Same,&quot; the musical prowess of each member shines throughout the entire concert. Listening to Led Zeppelin is like listening to the Shakespeare of hard rock. My only beef is the length of the songs played. &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; is way too long, clocking in at a half an hour, while &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; finishes at just over ten minutes. While this film certainly shows the great song writing ability of the band and musical ability, the concert seems to be more of a chance for the band to show off rather than entertain the crowd.
B00005221L|5.0|Outside of the Terminator series, Predator is easily Arnold's best action movie. It is completely engrossed with action from the helicopter deployment in the beginning, to the end of the movie. I also enjoyed Jesse Ventura's one-liners, not to mention his mini-gun. All in all a great movie, however the DVD lacks any real special features (make sure you buy the DTS version, there is a noticeable gain in sound fidelity).
1878424319|5.0|Miguel and Don have put together an excellent help guide, but remember that word guide. A guide leads you, you are capable of going places in time without that guide. The Toltec philosophy is in my opinion well supported and scientifically proven. The writers do bring that to light in a persuasive attempt to convince the reader, but I can deduce they have put this together in an honest write to contribute or help. The only thing I would warn is that we cannot allow ourselves to be confined to limited guidlines. A super book that also gives guidence, being  multi dimensional, which I highly recommend reading is Karl Mark Maddox  SB 1 or God
B00005QZ7U|5.0|ROUGE is probably the MOST derivative film I have ever seen.<br />&quot;Camille&quot; and &quot;Lola Montez&quot; come quickly to mind.  However, it<br />is a work of great creative genius...and while you see things<br />go past that you have visited before...the context and settings<br />are vastly different.  Watching this film is rather like watching<br />five dump trucks filled with glitter and five shovels full of<br />diamonds each dump their loads off of El Capitan...there is NO<br />WAY you are not going to watch...and there is no way you can<br />tell the glitter from the diamonds!  All that said, it is a<br />vastly entertaining film and well worth watching or adding to<br />your dvd collection.  I promise you that you will go back again<br />and again to try to sift the diamonds from the glitter.
B00004R99L|2.0|Anyone's who's ever had the unfortunate pleasure of listening to a long-winded co-worker yammer on and on about his dreams from the previous night will have an idea of what it's like to sit through this pointless, animated film.<br />I hadn't seen ALICE IN WONDERLAND since I was very young, and decided to watch it again with older eyes...I couldn't believe how utterly bored I was. Alice wanders through a series of long, meandering encounters filled with pointless riddles, repetitive stupidity, and unintriguing detail. Realizing it's farcical makes matters worse, I think, since it's known ahead of time that all the blathering won't amount to anything.<br />The animation and design of Alice herself is the highlight of the film. Aside from that, there are only a couple of dark, psychedelic moments which barely have enough screen time to be interesting.<br />Save your money and get JUNGLE BOOK or PINNOCHIO. ALICE IN WONDERLAND is a mediocre film, at best. I couldn't recommend it to anyone over the age of 10.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I saw Moulin Rouge for the first time on DVD and could just kick myself for missing the theatrical release. Although it appears to be a 'love it' or 'hate it' experience, I am amazed at how much I love this film. This is a daring update on the musical form, and one which is astoundingly effective. I always believed the singing, I always accepted that yes indeed, those feelings, that moment, could only be expressed by bursting into song. Are these broadway-style belters? Nope, and the movie is all the better for it. The voices are not bad, but not great. They are the voices we think we have as we sing in the shower. At times too breathy, too shrill, not supported -- but always honest and pleasant. The combinations of songs and musical moments is the musical as it would be if we all actually lived in a musical, snippets of popular songs joining together in unexpected ways to form the soundtrack of our feelings. I thought the acting was fabulous, Nicole Kidman (who I haven't really liked in anything since Dead Calm) is a revelation. Ewan Magregor is terrific as always, and Jim Broadbent menacing and touching. Richard Roxburgh, as the evil duke, is a fascinating mix of Gary Oldman and Snidely Whiplash in a wonderfully over-the-top performance. Even through the flash of the film, what I remember are the wonderfully human small moments -- Nicole's reaction the first time Ewan starts to sing; Ewan battling back sobs as he angrily thanks Nicole for &quot;curing him of his silly infatuation with love&quot; the moments when Nicole puts on her prostitute emotional armour to avoid her true feelings -- astounding work. I can't recommend this movie more highly a thrilling and challenging experience that you will come back to again and again.
6302968135|5.0|I have watched Blood in Blood out for more then 20 times and still LOVE it.<BR>Very emotional scenes, powerful and the acting is sublime from all the 3 characters!!<BR>They all should get an oscar for it!<BR>My whole family and friends has seen it ( they had too ;o) and from all ages they loved it!<BR>Go watch this one and you won't regret it.<BR>You will be hooked on it forever like I am.<BR>Take care
B00005QG9J|4.0|Morning View is a good CD. But when I purchased an Incubus CD, I wasn't expecting something that sounds like Dave Mathews. Anyway, I really like this CD. But it doesn't compare to SCIENCE or Make Yourself, which I do give 5 stars to. If you're an Incubus fan, you will probably be dissapointed. I got to like this CD, so I'm not dissapointed, but its not as good.
B000002N9L|4.0|Do yourself a favor. Forget the past 2 Prince albums, RAVE and RAINBOW, and buy this album. It is a great dirty rock and weird funk album. It comes from a time when PRince was pissed off and was tossing off quality songs. If these are supposed throwaways, then these &quot;throwaways&quot; are 600 times better than the crappy noodlings of his new religious crapcet album RAINBOW CHILDREN. &quot;dinner With Dolores&quot; has a great haunting melody. All the songs have this very claustrophobic, creepy rock feel, that i love. He will never make an album this good again. Totally overlooked when it was released.
B000002BUY|5.0|I love this CD. Their only CD that you can label as &quot;Metal&quot;. Each song is strong and inspiring. Maybe I'll never get tired of this CD. Its lyrics aren't distructive or anything.
6300214559|5.0|Great movie! I loved it! i saw it in school and i loved it so much i ordered it online! I WATCH IT ALL THE TIME! IF ONLY THEY HAD MADE IT ON DVD!
B000002BUY|5.0|I have the 3 last Incubus CDs. SCIENCE is the best one in my opinion. By far.
0804106304|3.0|I just found the writing to have the typical style that many best selling books are written in.  I was surprized that it received such good praise from critics.
B00005QAPH|5.0|For anyone who owns the MPI transfer of this film on VHS and is wondering if the Criterion DVD is worth your while (did you ever doubt it?) -- it most definitely is!<br />I am stunned by what Criterion have done with my favorite film! The uncropped format is only the beginning -- artifacts from obviously decaying source material have been cleaned up and the whole thing takes on a brilliant, sharp look. The technical quality is so good one begins to forget it wasn't filmed yesterday. The sound is clearer and more audible and the subtitles are now of course legible.<br />I couldn't be happier. It's brilliant. It makes the film that much more immersive and enjoyable. Get the DVD now, you won't regret it.<br />(As a side note: I have also recently had occasion to see the \\"other\\" single-disc, non-Criterion DVD transfer of 8 1/2. There is absolutely no comparison; the Criterion DVD is spectacular, while the \\"other\\" DVD release is hard better than VHS, if it is at all! Do yourself a favor and shell out the few extra dollars for the Criterion DVD!)
B00004ZAV3|3.0|Sure these songs are classics and sure The Beatles are the greatest rock and roll band ever.  I find it interesting that yet another greatest hits compilation sold so well considering there have been previous compilations assembled (remember the red and blue albums and the Anthology Series?)<br />If you're not willing to pay the money for the entire catalog, I guess this is a good sampler CD.  I would recommend that a buyer just buy the entire Beatles catalog and the Past Masters collections.  That way you have everything The Beatles ever recorded during their time.  It is THE catalog worth owning.
B00003CXXP|5.0|A.I. is a twisted vision of the classic tale of Pinocchio in which, Haley Joel Osment plays an android (David) meant to fill the void of his owners who've given up hope on their son's comatose condition. Along the way, David learns the disturbing truth of who, or what rather, he really is. This film is one of the most important films you will see, not only because it is a visual masterpiece with stand-out performances, but because it deals with powerful societal and moral issues that leave you thinking for days. A.I. is powerful moviemaking thanks to Steven Spielberg, with great insight thanks to Stanley Kubrick, that results in an eerily majestic story. If you are a fan of either of the above directors it is a must. I would highly suggest this to fans of Tim Burton's works as the mergence of Spielberg and Kubrick's effort seem almost similar to films like Edward Scissor Hands.
158788772X|5.0|The Godfather . . . What a wonderful book and movie!  The book is hard to put down.  The characters become so real and vivid in the book.  Vito Corleone, the Godfather, and his family and &quot;business&quot; associates are discussed in detail in this book.  How the Mafia was started as well as how the Corleone family itself was established is included in this book.  The detail of the appearance of each person is amazing.  Reading the book is more entertaining than watching the movie.  The book goes into alot more detail than the movie does and the book shows how Vito Corleone got his start in the Mafia business.  I hope everyone that has seen the movie will read the book.  There is more detail and more material than could ever be included in the movie.  This is honestly one of the best books I have ever read.  Every time I read it the more entranced I become with the secret world of the Mafia.
B0000508U6|5.0|Chris Martin of Coldplay is easily one of the finest male vocalists to hit the scene in the last few years. He has emotion, smooth delivery, and a good range. His voice is what makes these songs extraordinary. Not to mention the musical arrangements and productions are spectacular. The over all feel is somewhat Pink Floydian- but more so in a pop music sense. The songs are light and easy to like. \\"Yellow\\" contains lyrics which put a good feeling in your soul. \\"Trouble\\" is seen occassionally on MTV. All the songs have an otherworldly mellow mood to them with strong guitar solos. All in all I'd say Coldplay has a future in the music business. If they keep on making music like this they will probably be around for a very long time.
0613174674|4.0|The Reader seemed to take two different paths in this novel.  The first path is the affair between Michael and Hanna.  Hanna teaches Michael the ways of loving and showers him with attention and love.  The second path seems to be the path of Hanna giving advice to Michael about his life and his future.  The two seem to conflict at times but the novel is very well written.  It seems like they're an old married couple at times.  The book is touching and it shows the love that they have for one another but yet can't continute acting on.  Later in the book, Michael finds out a secret about Hanna and he is forced to face her once again.  It's interesting how their relationship is like a circle.  The book is easy to read and follow and is full of rich detail.  I would recommend the book to everyone because everyone can benefit from reading it.
B00005JHCP|5.0|Well, I only love this because clasic literature rocks and Charles Dickens rocks, and DANIEL RADCLIFFE IS A CUTEY PIE! Also it is and inspirational story of the life and times of the character David Copperfield.
B000003TAL|5.0|This cd is very special to me. I had bought Washing Machine in the eighth grade which exicted me enough to want to hear more Sonic Youth. After doing some online research, I bought this with the promise it was Sonic Youth's pinnacle. I wasn't disappointed. For the first time I heard real promise and mystery and exictement in music. The abstract sections became my favorite parts, from the waves of guitars that ride Kim Gordon's simple bassline in the second half the Sprawl to the vertigous spiral collapse in the center of Total Trash to the noise of Providence (which sounds like the recording you always hear when you see the camera on old rockets showing the stages of the rocket seperating and falling off) I began to realize the emotional potential of music. It made me feel optimistic about life and art in the best purest wide-open beatnik way. Even, or rather especially, the darker parts of the record like the first two parts of Trilogy or Rain King. For they weren't so much dark as sort of hazy and stumbling through the crowded streets confused but taking it all in. Sonic Youth has never been particular distinguished lyricist (cf. NYC Ghosts &amp; Flowers for some particular embarrasing moments) but on Daydream Nation the words fit. Maybe they didn't mean anything (I'm sure people have various theories on what they mean and whatnot) but they convincingly conveyed (always secondarily to the music) abstractly the same feelings that arose of the guitar snarl and meltdown which Sonic Youth are true masters of. Every abstract moment in music I have heard since this is filtered through it. From Captain Beefheart to Autechre to free jazz, abstraction is always measured in my head to Daydream Nation, and understood in relation to Daydream Nation. A personal Rosetta Stone of sorts. It's complexity seemed to encapsulate and positively ooze a rich variety of musical history and possiblity. It feels like hundreds of records were somehow mashed together. That is what makes Daydream Nation so special. Only Trout Mask Replica (another personal favorite) also manages to capture that feel, and make it really really work.ream Nation so special. Only Trout Mask Replica (another personal favorite) also manages to capture that feel, and make it really really work.
0553269631|5.0|Most people will have read this before they reach their 40s. I'm a bit slower than most I suppose since I've just now gotten around to reading it. I think I'm better off though since I doubt I would have appreciated it as much if I were younger and less, dare I say, worldly.  I won't rehash the plot since there are dozens of reviews that have done that already. I will say that this is a book that needs to be read. I recommend gathering around other Southern writers and read it as a stew with Harper Lee, Flannery O'Conner and Erskine Caldwell.  McCullers has subtly developed characters and lulls you into a fog of desperation.  I agree with Ms. Powell who said &quot;read it as an adult.&quot;
B00005JKMO|4.0|It only amazes me that this movie is based on an actual man, and not a fictional character.  When watching this movie it made me feel more proud to be an African-American than ever before.  The performance by Will Smith was indeed excellent...not to mention the performances of the supporting cast.  I find it typical that some critics would give this movie low ratings...could it be that this is typical of films that show African-Americans in a positive &quot;hero-istic&quot; light?  Could be, but I know for sure that this is a movie that everyone should see.  If you could sit through &quot;Titanic&quot; then by all means, this should be much easier.  Don't get me wrong, I loved &quot;Titanic&quot;, but the fight scenes in Ali are riveting and the director deserves a standing ovation and a much needed pat on the back.  So often we forget that there are heroes right here on earth...not to mention one that is still living!!!
0064407667|3.0|When the Baudelaire children loose their parents in a terrible fire, they are adopted by a very distant family member, Count Olaf. Count Olaf lives in a gruesome house and is the leader of a strange and rather frightening group of actors. The children have to do all kinds of tasks and in general their lives are pretty miserable. And the situation becomes even more miserable when Count Olaf has a not so pretty surprise for them in store...<br />The bad beginning is the first of a series of  books that all have in common that the events described in them are indeed very unfortunate. For me the events are a bit too unfortunate, but maybe that is because I am grown up. I like it when something good happens every now and then. Also, the superfluous explanation by the author of words that are in my opinion not too difficult and can be understood by 10-year olds, starts to be irritating after a while.<br />All in all an enjoyable read, but it cannot stand in the shadow of the Harry Potter series.
B00005OWIU|3.0|Sorry, I just couldn't avoid mentioning this...<BR>The quality is undoubtable, the atmosphere of the movie is definitely there, but perhaps Mr. Williams could have avoided being so blatantly ''inspired'' by Grieg's &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;....
6304626495|5.0|To say a Monty Python movie is funny is like saying grass is green.  It is about as redundant as it gets.  This movie however adds so much social commentary and such hilarious items (Brian's Latin Lession for one.) that one can't help but celebrate it.<br />When this movie was released there was a bit of a hue and cry about it being sacreligious.  As a practicing Roman Catholic I catagorically say it is not.  In fact the two spots where Christ is refered to are actually a very good allegory on two gospel messages (eyes that do not see, ears that do not hear) and of gratitude (were not all 10 made whole?  Where are the other nine.)  No where in the movie does the picture insult Christian belief or Christianity.  This is actually a bit odd as Python has always been an equal oppertunity offender.<br />We see classic lines and commentary from the list produced in answering the question: &quot;What did the Roman's ever do for us?&quot;  To Elmer Fudd's cousin Pilate.  Terry Gilliam manages to get an unforgetable animation scene that will catch you off guard, not easy in a Python movie.<br />John Cleese said the theme of the movie is &quot;Think for yourself.&quot;  This movie delivers the message with plenty of humor and without insulting Christ.  <br />All in all a fantastic movie.  Only the greatness of the Holy Grail keeps it from being the best of the Python movies.
B00003CXDD|5.0|When this movie first came out, I fell in love with it.  I was just a little girl but I knew this would be ONE of my favorite movies of all time. That's why, when I saw it, I had to get it.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Pink's new CD M!ssundaztood has many original, and unique tracks.  In this CD, Pink shows a deeper, more personal side.  She also adds to her R&amp;B style and image that we saw in her previous album Can't Take Me Home.  The songs on her new album, which vary from slow, upbeat, rap, and rock are like no other.   We see a new side of Pink. She isn't afraid to dive right in to personal matters such as divorce, pain, and loneliness.  I like the lyrics in each of her songs because they tell a story in a creative way.  It is obvious that Pink wants to be her own person, and is searching for her own identity.  For example in the title track \\"M!ssundaztood,\\" she tells that she is \\"on the wrong track, looking for the right track.\\"  Her songs are catchy and well presented.  Her voice is well suited to her songs and lyrics.  Pink's originality and style make M!ssundaztood a CD well worth having. She has changed so much since her first album, I can't wait to see what is in store for us for the next one.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Why is it the producers or director felt they had to put in a love triangle? Do we need that in a movie about Pearl Harbor? I don't think so. Someone said it was a perfect telling of the story? Are you kidding? Were you there? I doubt it. This triangle only detracted and made the movie longer than it needed to be. I won't buy this movie because of the love triangle. the action sequences, music, sound, and acting were outstanding. To bad the contrived love triangle drug down the movie.
B000001FCB|5.0|If there is just one artist that could translate brazilian feelings into a single voice, this artist is Elis Regina. The manner she could play with her voice is completly amazing. And, if there is just one artist that could translate brazilian music history, that is, brazilian music quality, this artist is Tom Jobim, who, with Vinicius de Moraes, wrote poetry into music and presented innocence to the masters.
0451167716|5.0|If you've seen the movie The Godfather, then Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando, and Al Pacino struck you with greatness. Now its time to buy and read Mario Puzo's all time classic and be blown away all over again. But if you're expecting a peaceful read that you can relax at night and read before sleep you'd be sadly mistaken.<br />Puzo's classic novelization of the mafia saga of Vito and Michael Corrleone is a must for every literate in the world. Between these covers are tales of crime, corruption, savage murder, love, drugs, Las Vegas, triumph, tragedy, and Vito Corrleone's rise as the nation's greatest Mafia kingpin. And all these stories are written with fiery intensity and passion that brings the characters to life in ways few authors can. Puzo writes this book so well that you will cringe in horror at the savage and corrupt ways of the Sicilian mafia, and all the terrible things that the members of these Mafia families will do.<br />So if you've seen the movie and was simply blown away or if you're just a fan of good reading that brings the characters out of the pages of the book and leaves them stamped in your mind then here is an offer you can't refuse; buy it now, and enjoy some of the greatest literature EVER!
0789723107|5.0|This is by far the best book I have read on on how to design a site -- not from the images point of view, but from the usability point of view. After designing sites since 1994 a lot of things come second nature to me in terms of navigation and information design. I was looking for a book the designers that work with me could read and benefit from, one that would explain in clear terms the reasons why I do what I do, and this was the perfect one. I must have read at least a dozen of them before it, and none made the grade. This one does. Highly recommended!
B00005MAM2|5.0|Akira is THE anime film.  There is no question.  Each frame was hand drawn...no computer cheating here...just the finest example of the mastery and artwork of japanese animators.  This DVD makes some good leaps forward for the film; for one, the use of real child actors to voice the telekinetic children...very effective and creepy.  The new english translation is not as stuttery...the language is more realistic and believeable.  Having a good workling knowledge of Japanese Idiom, I can say that the new translation is superb.  If you even THINK you like anime, get this disc !!!!!
B00003CXSP|5.0|I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT.  ANTHONY HOPKINS WAS EXCELLENT AS ALWAYS AS HANNIBAL.  JULIANNE MOORE WAS A PRETTY GOOD SUBSTITUE FOR JODIE FOSTER.  I WISH SHE WAS IN THIS ONE TOO.  BUT JULIANNE IS THE NEXT BEST THING.  THE MOVIE IS ACTION PACKED AND KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT UNTIL THE VERY END.  THE DVD HAS ALTERNATE ENDINGS.  2 THAT ARE FILMED AND ONE THE DIRECTOR GOES AND TELLS YOU ABOUT.  THE ONE THAT IS IN THE VIDEO AND ON THE MOVIE SCREEN IS THE BEST, BUT IS NICE TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE ALSO CONSIDERING.<BR>THE DVD VERSION ALSO HAS DELETED SCENCES, SOME SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE MOVIE AND OTHERS YOU SEE WHY THEY TOOK THEM OUT.<BR>OVERALL, IF YOU ARE A BIG FAN OF THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS YOU MUST SEE THIS SEQUEL.  OKAY DOKEY!  BYE FOR NOW CLARICE.
0780626478|2.0|When I saw this ill-friendshiped movie, I couldn't belive at how bitchy Alicia was to Brendan in this so called feel-good movie. What also surprised me was how Brendan never said or did anything to get back at her for how mean she was to him. It sucked in romance, love, and even friendship. And what romance!?, they didn't strip a single shirt when they french-kissed. The only thing I really liked about this movie was Christopher Walken, he's such a great actor! Anyway, Alicia basically verbally slaughtered Brendan from beginning to end, how disgusting! It was like she was on PMS throughout the entire movie! I felt sorry for Brendan Fraser...
B000002MUQ|5.0|When it comes to lead singers of Van Halen, Diamond Dave is my favorite.  But that doesn't mean Sammy isn't good.  To the contrary I am a van halen fan and love them no matter who is at the helm.  <br />As such I must say that Balance is my favorite van halen album of all time.  It combines some classic sounds of Van Halen with some new innovations.  The band never loses its \\"sound\\" no matter what direction they take.
B00004Z459|5.0|I heard them probably about a year ago &quot;One Step Closer&quot; on the radio and I was like they sound like everyone else.  Then I heard their new song &quot;In The End&quot; about a week ago and was really impressed.  They have their own style &quot;Very refreshing&quot; from anything out their right now.. Then last night I saw the concert on MTV and was like WoW what a f....g great concert I never heard anything like them before. They are kind of like 311 but different and better.  I am getting the CD immediattley they are truley amazing.<br />-J:)
B00005QZ7U|5.0|MOULIN ROUGE is one of the weirdest movies i've ever seen. It's very different and wildly entertaining. It's a musical/romance/fantasy. Nicole Kidman (Satine) and Ewan McGregor (Christian) give excellent performances. Who knew Nicole and Ewan could sing so well?! They hit every note. John Leguizamo is also great. Visually, this movie is incredible. The settings are magical and original. MOULIN ROUGE is like nothing else. There's singing, dancing, and out of this world dramatic, emotional, silly, and comical performances by the cast. MOULIN ROUGE is set in 19th century France but they sing a lot of modern pop songs (ie: &quot;your song&quot;, &quot;like a virgin&quot;, &quot;diamonds are a girls best friend&quot;, etc.) in here. It may seem a bit odd but it goes with the plot. The basic plot is about a writer that falls in love with a prostitute. Sounds pretty basic but this movie is anything but. It's eye-popping visuals, beautiful songs, outrageous coreography, and awesome acting will keep you entertained. MOULIN ROUGE is very &quot;over-the-top&quot; and may seem strange to some. But if you're willing to experice a movie like no other, then MOULIN ROUGE is a great place to start. The bonus stuff on the DVD is great too. Lots of stuff to check out. MOULIN ROUGE is a dazzler.
B0000028RR|5.0|This album is nothing short of amazing, it is probably the best album in the band's career, although all of their records are pretty incredible, it is a necessity for every cd rack.
0790730960|4.0|Great movie. The last good Batman. Usually seqeuls fall well short of the original but in this case it is not true. Although it may not be quite as good Catwoman is amzing and keaton is still the best Batman. A great movie made for entertainment.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I was so happy to hear that No Doubt had a new album coming out. I am not a huge fan, but I really enjoy their stuff. This is the first album I have heard all year that was actually worth the $.... Maybe I'm buying the wrong stuff, but most other releases this year have be Ho Hum. This is a Really Really Good Album. Songs like \\"Hey Baby\\", \\"Hella Good,\\" and \\"Platinum Blonde Life\\" are just awesome songs.  However, \\"Waiting Room\\" is the best song I have heard all year.  It was worth the CD just for that one song!!! I will confess I am a huge Prince fan, so it helps that he produced and sings in it. The only thing that keeps me from giving a big 5 stars is a few songs are kinda weak, but the title track \\"rock steady\\" is the worst song. Not an aweful song, just very average on an otherwise excellent album.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|I wanted to see this movie in the theatre, but that didn't happen.  I then read good and horrible reviews so I was ambivalent.  <br />Then Santa brought the DVD...  WOW!  Granted- the premise is hackneyed and the singing isn't as polished as it could be, but let's face it- Nicole Kidman sings better than I do and Macgregor does as well. <br />I would recommend only seing this on DVD so the quality of the movie stays at the highest level.  The colors, the costumes, the makeup- all would be diminished on VHS.  Plus all the extras on the discs are as fantastic as the movie itself.<br />I'd give this 5 stars if I hadn't turned to my husband so many times and said &quot;This is such a WEIRD movie.&quot;  Maybe after I watch it a few more times the fifth star will fall into place.
B00003CXTG|2.0|It's amazing how far Hollywood fatcats will go to make a huge buck. It's downright disrespectful to take anyone, especially a few KIDS who can't act to retell (in their own way) perhaps the biggest event in our nation's history (9/11 notwithstanding). Why take a historical event & throw in a love story? Who cares? Again, WHO CARES? Any one of our treasured WWII vets would surely puke at this terrible farce. To boot, the movie [is not very good], and the CGI gets old really fast. I know most want to see this picture, so be my guest. Be prepared for a massive letdown.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Hans Zimmer is great.Simply the greatest music composer i have ever heard.Russel Crowe a deserving oscar winner.The right choice for the movie.And Joaquin Phoenix is a plus to the movie.The movie is written well goes well to the right to the end and what makes it better is Hans Zimmer music.Matches soo well wid the movie and the scenes.Tracks like The Battle,Honor Him and Now We Are Free are soo good.The movie is soooo well written.It is the BOMB.Dont be a loooooser buy this movie right now.

B00005JKMO|4.0|(*** of 4)<br />It's funny how all the award nominees typically wait for the end of the year.  &quot;Ali&quot; is fortunate to have a brilliant director and excellent performances behind it.  Will Smith plays the one and only Muhammad, taking his life and transforming it brilliantly to the screen.  We are taken through the stages, decisions and fights, in-and-out of the ring, that made him the Ali as we know him today.<br />Jamie Foxx, Jon Voight, Jada Pinkett Smith and Mario Van Peebles co-star.  They all present their characters goldenly great.  Why is there a 3 star rating of 4 rather than all four?<br />This film spends too much time with itself.  Ali (Smith) is taking a run and we spend ten whole minutes watching his tracks.  Ali's attitude has been twisted into something a little different than realistic.  The world is dark and here-and-there depressing.  The film is slow and is elongated into a terminating 2 hours and 40 minutes.  There is too much in this film.  It is drawn out beyond reach.  Michael Mann obviously didn't check his editing very much, because it seems as though he didn't at all.  Luckily enough, the film seems to be &quot;fine&quot; as it is.<br />This film is very dramatic, but not superb.  I'll give it a Best Actor nomination, Best Supporting Actor nomination (Voight), and a Best Original Screenplay nomination, but no Best Picture because it just isn't quite there yet.  But it is a good film, one that I recommend, simply because it is very much understandable and as realistic as Hollywood will get.  It holds more facts in it than fiction, something that didn't exist with The Hurricane.  Ali is a good film, but nothing more than that.<br />QUOTE: &quot;This film raises its standards a little higher than it can come to.  The performances are dominating the film, which makes the film seem as good as it is, but it is drawn out too much and becomes so overwhelmed by itself that it forgets how long the audience has been sitting there.  As it is,Ali is a rocking film that shines with its colors of pride and victory.  Will Smith and Michael Mann have made a standard good film.  But it misses the one factor that made Rocky a powerhouse movie.  This film deserves a handshake, but to gravel at its feet by saying it's the best film of the year, is a little over-doing it.&quot;

B00005QW5X|5.0|Hansel is a young boy growing up in communist East Berlin.<br />Hedwig Robinson is a divorced Army wife following her former lover turned Rock Icon, Tommy Gnosis, with her band &quot;The Angry Inch&quot;.<br />How Hansel becomes Hedwig, and how Hedwig becomes whole, is the story told in &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot;.<br />A lot of people have drawn comparisons between &quot;Hedwig&quot; and &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, and while both are glam rock musicals with a bit of &quot;gender-bending&quot; that started out as stage shows, that's about where the similarities end.<br />Where &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; is a sexual farce loosely based on Frankenstein, &quot;Hedwig&quot; takes it's direction from Aristotle's speech (from Plato's Symposium) on  the origin of love, essentially that once upon a time, humans had twice the arms, legs, and faces we have now, but were cut in two by the gods for being too proud - love comes from a desire to find the half we were seperated from.  <br />Hansel's search leads him to an American GI who asks to marry him, but with the stipulation that &quot;in order to leave, you have to leave a little somtehing behind&quot;.  Hansel adopts his mother's name and hesitantly undergoes a botched sex change (in the same fashion as a back alley abortion), which leaves him with an &quot;angry inch&quot; of flesh.<br />A year later, a newly divorced woman scraping by on odd jobs and babysitting gigs, Hedwig meets and falls in love with Tommy Speck, whom she soon decides is her &quot;other half&quot;.   When Tommy decides he can't handle who (what?) she is, and runs away to become a rock star with the songs they wrote together, Hedwig takes to stalking him, shadowing his tour with a tour of her own through a chain of seafood restaurants.<br />As an unconventional love story whose ultimate message is &quot;love thyself&quot;, &quot;Hedwig&quot; is a movie with a lot of laughs and a lot of heart.  in creating an over the top, in your face star who's alternately cruel and heartbroken, John Cameron Mitchell manages to give us a completely (and surprisingly) believable character that despite having little in common with, almost everyone can identify with.<br />As if the movie weren't fabulous enough, the dvd comes with extended footage, a commentary by JCM and director of photography, some of the best menu design I've yet to see on a dvd, and best of all, a wonderful feature length documentary on the history of &quot;Hedwig&quot; from the first performance at Squeezebox to the present, including interviews with &quot;Hed-Heads&quot; (fans) discussing how much it's meant to them and how much a part of their lives it's become.
B000002C1W|5.0|This was one of Pink Floyds CD's that I did not buy. I didn't think thaat floyd would sound right without Waters.  but on day I was toodling along the used discount section in the closest music store and found this for 5 bucks. I thought &quot;why not&quot;.  I got home and listened to it and I was amazed how good it was.  It was good to get away from all the Waters songs about either going crazy or Cyd Barret.  I really liked learning to fly and the dogs of war the best. all of the songs are good to listen to also. It is very good and I think this is a great buy. I recommend it to everyone.
B00005JKMO|1.0|The movie &quot;Ali&quot; should have been as great as the real Ali.  But it was awful.  Beyond awful.  This was the first movie I've seen in a decade that I wanted to walk out on.  You learn next to nothing about Ali during the entire movie and are left mostly wondering why we have to watch Ali take a shower in slow motion.  The whole thing is a confused, slow motion mess, more intent on being a long music video than on telling what should be a fascinating story.  The movie is dull and boring -- and making it last 3 hours didn't help.  Mind you, a good Ali movie could easily last 3 hours, but this one wasn't it.  On the bright side, the casting was brilliant and Will Smith is amazing in this role -- he somehow transformed his slight build into a credible heavyweight boxer and is entirely believable as Muhammad Ali (these good points make it even more disappointing that the movie is lousy).  Smith was so good in the role, and this movie was so awful, that someone should make a real movie about Ali, and recast Smith in the title role.  After this performance, no one else could measure up to Smith as Ali.  His performance deserves a much better movie and I'm serious that another director should make that movie with Smith -- it would be worth the effort.  As for this movie, I wouldn't bother seeing it at the theater or on video or DVD -- it's just not worth it.  One of the worst movies I've seen in a long while.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Being included on the Vanilla Sky soundtrack just might be the big break Sigur Ros needs to become more widely accepted in mainstream music circles. I have to admit that after listening to Svefn-g-englar on VS, their unusual sound piqued my curiosity enough to make me check out other works.
0767802470|4.0|Great movie but some one cut out the best part.  I remember<br />seeing a version of this movie on cable t.v. and there was a<br />scene where the submarine crew members were singing a war hymn and were stomping their feet. It was a very powerful scene and in<br />my view showed the germans in a positive light. It made you feel<br />that they beleived in their \\"cause\\" and watching the scene made you feel proud of them. All in all it was still a good movie. ...

B00004TJTS|3.0|Set in the 1940s, 'My Dog Skip' is a peaceful story of a suburban 8 year-old child with no brothers, sisters, pets or friends from school. However, as his 9th birthday comes and goes, he receives a memorable gift: his first dog Skipper. From then on, Willie isn't seen anywhere without his new friend. Bonds develop and Skip becomes known by many of the local townspeople.<br />After some hard times in school and in playing baseball, Willie hits Skip, to the disgust of everyone in sight, including the girl that he was aspiring a friendship with. Willie proceeds to believe that the world has ended as Skip runs away, but never gives up and perseveres.<br />'My Dog Skip' is certainly a very relatable story to anyone who has ever been a kid. It isn't a childish movie, and it is very well done and in tune with other stories of that time. It's lesson brings the idea that nice guys do win sometimes.

B00005N5S5|5.0|The original &quot;Terminator&quot; is arguably the greatest sci-fi/action film ever, and the Special Edition DVD finally does this classic film justice. Many people look at the sequel as the better of the two, but remember, Cameron was given a huge budget for T2. He was forced to film &quot;The Terminator&quot; for less than $6 million. If you're like me, you could write enough about this movie to fill an encyclopedia, but I'll try to give just a breif plot description for those who have yet to see it.<br />In the future, SkyNET, the supercomputer in control of all military power, decides that humans must be destroyed and begins a massive nuclear war that destroys most of the population. The survivors form a resistance agains the computer and its mechanical army, and eventually defeat it, thanks to their leader John Connor. In a final effort to win, the computer sends a Terminator back in time to kill John's mother, Sarah, before he is born. The humans send back a lone soilder, Kyle Reese, to protect Sarah from the seemingly unstoppable cyborg.<br />When the movie was originally filmed, the soundtrack was recorded in mono, which sounded horrible on the original DVD release of the Terminator. But here you can find a newly recorded soundtrack, with the original soundtrack remixed along with new gun and explosion sound effects. Most of the new sounds are very cool (esp. the HK entrance in the first scene), and the new gun effects are good for the most part. Only in a few instances are the new sounds a little weak. Fortunately the DVD also sports the original mono soundtrack for when you want to watch the original verion. <br />Next to the film itself, the best part of this DVD is the Special Features, most of which were unavailable before. There are two Terminator documentaries, which have cast and crew interviews and behind the scene footage of the original filming of the Terminator, very cool stuff for die hards. Also featured are deleted scenes from the original film, which offer a deeper look into the Terminator mythology, and shows different sides of some characters which you wouldn't see in the original. Also in the special features are all the original storyboards for the film and hundreds more photos of the sets, actors and sketches from the original production. Simply put, for die hard Terminator fans, your wait is over. Terminator: Special Edition is a godsend.<br />HERE ARE ALSO TWO SECRETS I HAVE FOUND SO FAR ON THE DVD. On side one, under Languages, more to &quot;Francais&quot; so it is highlighted. Now move to the right. A little box on the right side of the screen should now be highlighted. Click on it. This gives access to one of four short, random interviews. The second secret is also on side one. Under special features, click on &quot;DVD Rom Features,&quot; then under there move so that the Main Menu shortcut is highlighted. Move to the right again, and another small box should now be highlighted. Click on that. This also gives access to four more interviews. Enjoy!
B00001OH7N|5.0|unlike bowie's more recognized work, 'the man who sold the world,' is a truly shocking piece of work. the songs fit together so well, in a way that i have never heard on any other album by any other artist. for those who only know the title songs from the nirvana cover (believe me, it's brilliant too), there is just so much more on this album than that single song.<br />the album opens with, 'width of a circle,' an angry and uncompromising (and very long!) track which layers on the guitars to the skies. this is the first album where bowie worked with legendary guitarist mick ronson, and his presence is most felt on this song. 'all the madmen,' is a disturbing trip into the realms of insanity. i've heard it's a semi-autobiographical piece, but craziness has never sounded so beautiful.<br />the next few songs have a fairly led zeppelin-esque sound to them, particularly the great, 'black country rock,' which is a hell of a lot of fun. 'after all,' is a depressing (but rather profound) dirge, and 'running gun blues,' although it has rather un-pc lyrics (like i care), rounds out the trio perfectly.<BR>the next two songs are a bit forgettable, 'saviour machine,' and she shook me cold,' although the former has a great bass line. and after that, we have the marvellous title track and, 'the supermen,' one of the best songs on the album.<br />so this album never really lets up, and should be listened through all the way for a truly nightmarish experience.
B000051S3Z|1.0|Stupid? Slow moving? Hard to follow? Yep. This one's so bad it's actually pretty entertaining. The thing to do is get hold of this movie, have some friends over (bringing beer), and spend a winter weekend afternoon discussing Rio Lobo's vast flaws and shortcomings. Take US Cavalry Col. John Wayne's unique strategy for chasing a gang of train robbers, for example: every time you come to a fork in the road, say: &quot;Half you men go that way -- the rest, follow me!&quot; Of course, you can only do that so many times before you end up, as The Duke does here, chasing the bad guys all by yourself. This apotheosizes John Wayne's mythic solitary hero persona. Or maybe it's just really stupid (but maybe it's unfair to expect much, given that the JW character's civilian occupation is &quot;aimless drifter&quot;). Take the slow meandering repetitive dialogue -- &quot;You can't arrest this woman without a warrant. Do you have a warrant to arrest this woman?&quot; &quot;Golly, I didn't think of getting a warrant to arrest her.&quot; &quot;Well, if you don't have a warrant you can't arrest her. You'll have to go back and get a warrant.&quot; &quot;But I don't have time to go back and get a warrant...&quot; Oh, you get your money's worth of talk out of this one alright. Take the way the Evil Cattle Baron (or whatever he is--it's not clear what he does for a living besides being Evil) gets captured by the Good Guys (a seriously motley crew that includes a Mexican Confederate officer called Frenchy) a third of the way through the movie, so he spends the remaining two-thirds just kind of tagging along--his part's over, you understand, but he's still there, in some corner of the screen in almost every shot till the end (&quot;Hi, mom!&quot;). You can even take the ECB's giant humongous fake eyebrows, leftover makeup from a caveman movie I'm guessing. You'll still have plenty of points for discussion, cause this is a very long movie (although not as long as it seems). That's &quot;Rio Lobo&quot;, folks. See it and find out why they don't make westerns any more.
B000002HJA|4.0|effort, unusual and more experimental even for Kyuss, The Circus is a step down from the mastery of Welcome to Sky Valley and the almost-as-good debut Blues. however a bad Kyuss album is like the best Limp Bizkit or other numetal offerings that pass themselves as hardcore metal (please guys, just stay on TRL please), so for anyone who considers themselves a fan of &quot;metal&quot; this record is a must have.
B00005B36H|5.0|I have owned this CD for 6 months.  The first time listening was a revelation.  I have listened consistently throughout those 6 months with ocassional breaks.  I just listened to this CD again on 12/28.  <br />It sounds better then it ever did!  This band has a gift.  Listen and reap the awards that gift offers!
B00003CXRM|5.0|I watch a lot of movies and have seen all of the \\"classics\\" and O' Brother Where Art Thou rates among the best of them - no kidding! Twenty years from now, they'll be airing this film on AMC and TCM alongside the likes of North by Northwest, The Wild Bunch and How Green Was My Valley.  <br />The story is completely engrossing and the cinematography is stunning.  Realize that filming took place in June/July when the Southern countryside was a lush, verdant green. That bone dry, depression-era dust bowl aesthetic is a wonder of digital editing.  <br />The Coen brothers have done two things that are all too rare in Hollywood these days.  First, their screenplay is original (yes, it's loosely based on Homer's Odyssey but to evaluate the film solely on this narrative framework is to overlook the other aspects of the film). Second, they've produced a film that captivates not with multi-million dollar action sequences and the latest Moby track but with great dialogue and an authentic blues/bluegrass soundtrack (well worth buying) that is as much a character in the movie as the three principals - Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) and Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro).  The eclectic cast (that also includes Charles Durning, Holly Hunter, Stephen Root and John Goodman) turns in superbly acted performances across the board.  Clooney, who all too often plays 2 dimensional characters, gives an award-worthy performance in what is unquestionably his best role to date.  Those not familiar with Nelson or Turturro will be impressed by these wonderfully skilled actors.  <br />I will say that a lot of people have told me that they didn't care for this film, which I find incomprehensible.  I'm not sure what more you could ask for in a movie.
B00004XOWM|2.0|Alright my favirote song on here would have to be My Way. Probably because I can relate to it. My generation is a good song,but you can tell it was aimed towards teenagers. I like the music but it could use better lyrics. Rollin,is a good song for dancing too but besides that its dorky. The only reason I like hot dog is because it reminds me of a friend. Otherwise I do not really care for it. The other songs are dull.
B00003CXTF|5.0|I think that the &quot;critics&quot; who have written their own reviews are too serious. I watched this movie not thinking about who directed it, or who produced it. I watched it to see the movie. The movie is very well put together. Out of the whole 3 hours I wasnt the slightest bit bored, and if it werent for the love story I know that I wouldnt have been able to sit through it. The acting truely makes you feel as if you were there. You really feel the worry and determination and even the love.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge - from start to finish - is what every other movie aspires to be.  With flash, with (yes!) spectacle, this movie (not &quot;film&quot;) entertains and reminds us that we are in a theater, watching and enjoying ourselves.  De Mille must be green with envy, wherever he is.<br />The DVD doesn't do too badly, either.  All the extra bits can lead one astray, if one is not very, very, careful.  I got lost in the costume stills, myself, but that is my own personal obsession.<br />Baz Luhrman and the team that supports him in his dream, making movies, shows no fear in painting a world that doesn't exist, but one that might have existed - if only someone had followed the Green Fairy, perhaps.  This is what has made Luhrman unique in his endeavours, this lack of fear in doing what he knows is necessary to realize his ideal.  The results have been wondrous, from Strictly Ballroom to Romeo + Juliet to Moulin Rouge.<br />Juxtaposing contemporary music with period location, sets, and costumes adds another layer of story-telling and grabs the attention of the audience.  Immediately there is a connection, no matter who in the audience feels that this juxtaposition may be taking things a bit too far (not me!  taking things too far often isn't far enough).  It also frees up set and costume design, in that anachronism becomes just another method of highlighting a character or place in the story.<br />The story itself is over the top, more than a fairytale, Gothic in romance, grand in scale, but ultimately simple in message.  It keeps reminding us that we are the watchers, not the participants.  We are the people the message is being brought to, and all the song and glory is for us, so we will remember the message forever.
B00005NW02|5.0|This CD is perfect! It goes from mellow to strong metal sounds! Lots of really cool screaming! System of a Down will be around for years to come.
0060392886|4.0|The men I thought of as gods when I was a teenagers were such PIGS, and I never knew it. But they have all grown into amazing men, fathers, husbands and best of all musicans. Through this book you realize the evolution of not only the Crue as men, but the evolution of thier music and the music of the 80's and now. <br />I thought the book was a great history of the bad boys of rock and roll. I really liked that they each had various chances to tell their version of the same story, thier way. At times I did feel as though I was ready porn, it is true Motley Crue. I do wish that Mick Mars had more to say, I finished the book and really wanted to know more about the quiet gutiar player who could really kick some... <br />I recommend this boook to those that are true fans and those who just might be a fan, you will be at the end.
B0000024IE|5.0|&quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; achieves a difficult feat in that it ups the ante on Public Enemy's &quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back,&quot; which was itself quite a piece of work. With this album, PE created its own chaotic universe on record, a swirling blend of politics, apocalyptic visions, sharply observed images of street life, along with pure sonic assault.<br />Much of the fuel for &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; is anger, make no mistake. From Chuck D.'s profane assault on Elvis Presley in &quot;Fight the Power&quot; to his counterattack on critics in &quot;Welcome to the Terrordome&quot; to the acid commentary on Tinseltown, &quot;Burn Hollywood Burn,&quot; there is no shortage of hostility from PE to the world they see around them.<br />But there's plenty of cutting humor in those songs and others as well, most notably Flavor Flav's &quot;911 Is a Joke.&quot; It's humor that doesn't let its target off the hook as it mocks the so-called public services that never seem to reach those most in need: &quot;Anytime you call, they never come correct/You can ask my man right here with the broken neck.&quot;<br />There are a slew of other great songs on this album, and most focus on PE's strong insistence on self-reliance and refusal to &quot;believe the hype&quot;: about themselves or anyone else. For my money, though, with the possible exception of the production masterpiece &quot;Welcome to the Terrordome,&quot; the best cut on the entire album is &quot;Revolutionary Generation,&quot; in which Chuck D. comes correct on the subject of treating women. Aside from its powerful message, &quot;Revolutionary Generation&quot; shows PE's ability to blend beats, sound bites, samples and commentary into a unique musical vision.<br />Public Enemy's work can and has been lumped into any number of categories, but the best approach for the listener is to free him or herself of any preconceptions, put on the headphones and enter their world. Don't expect to agree with everything they say, but as Chuck D. says, &quot;Never question what I am, God knows, 'cause it's coming from the heart.&quot; Highly recommended.
B00005JKQX|5.0|This is an excellent, must see movie (especially on the big screen the first time you watch it).  Moving, touching, Nash will grab your heart as you watch the turmoil and challenges that he endures. And Alicia is wonderful as she chooses to stay with him and help him get his life back.  The potrayal of what it is really like in a schizophrenics mind was excellent.  Yes, there are a few small things I call them that could have been better, but I've yet to see a movie that was perfect, there is always something you could have done better.  Once you get into the movie,(which will not take long) you could care less about the small things..you are so in to the John Nash character and supporting cast.  The movie was named accurately as it was a beautiful movie and had a beautiful ending.  My hat is off to you once again, Russell Crowe and also to Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Ron Howard and all other supporters.
B00005O5CM|3.0|In \\"Legally Blonde,\\" - which could well be re-titled \\"Clueless Goes to Harvard\\"  - the delightful Reese Witherspoon stars as a ditzy, fashion-obsessed airhead who winds up (through plot complications too elaborate to go through) taking that Ivy League law school by storm.  Needless to say, there is not a single believable moment in the film, but that is generally the case with most fish-out-of-water scenarios anyway.  What \\"Legally Blonde\\" does have is a warm spirit, a bubbly demeanor and a breezy charm that reflect to a tee the personality of its main character.<br />Although the film does not exhibit the same level of comic genius we found in \\"Clueless,\\" Witherspoon's letter-perfect rendition of the bubblehead stereotype earns the film a great deal of audience goodwill, a factor that helps us to get over some of the movie's flatter moments.  For indeed, throughout the course of this tale, we do hit a number of arid stretches where we feel that we should be laughing an awful lot more than we are.  In fact, \\"Legally Blonde\\" occasionally feels more like a concept in search of a movie than a full-fledged work in its own right.  But, just as you are about to give up on it, the filmmakers hit upon a hilarious concept, sight gag or line of dialogue, which help to set the movie back on track.<br />Clearly, Witherspoon is the big selling point of this film.  As an actress, she exudes such an air of intelligence, confidence and compassionate goodwill that she invests even her dumb blonde character with those seemingly paradoxical traits.  \\"Legally Blonde\\" isn't always at the top of its form, but Witherspoon wins the case for the film hands down anyway.
B00004T9VY|5.0|Cat Stevens was, and remains, my favorite musical performer.  This is perhaps the first widely popular (more mainstream) album Cat Stevens created.  While his many other albums are absolutely outstanding, this one provides a great starting point for a new affectionado to follow his singing and songwriting journey.  I don't believe any of his other albums include the song &quot;Into White&quot; - a truly inspired song to me that isn't included on his recently released boxed set or his other two &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; albums.  The clarity and strength of his voice is unmatched.  His concerts were a gift to those of us who journeyed along with him.  His music lives on with us who followed him until he left the music world, as well as with many newcomers as evidenced by the popularity expressed on his website.  His albums are among the few where nearly every cut becomes a favorite.
6305137293|4.0|This is an atmospheric and scary sequel - really worth to watch and own if you like the first part!<br />Pros:<BR>- atmosphere is similar spooky as in the fist part<BR>- quiet funky new Theme and Soundtrack <BR>- a suprisingly good and direct sequel<br />Cons:<BR>- average DVD picture quality<BR>- no Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack (just Dolby Stereo Surround)<BR>- no commentary track<BR>- no extras at all (except for some production notes)<br />General:<BR>- a new version from Universal Studios is now available, however I don't own it and I have no idea what extras may be on it or how good the quality is
B000002BMV|4.0|I remember being in the 4th grade and riding the school bus with a friend of mine who, for some reason, had the LP of this with him. I loved the futuristic cover and when I heard the music tucked inside the vinyl grooves...I've always separated Journey albums into 3 categories(excluding &quot;Arrival&quot; with Steve Augeri, which is one of their finest records):1)Pre-Steve Perry, progressive jazz-rock music 2)Classic, stadium-rock &amp; 3)Top 40, smooth R&amp;B schlock. This record was a culmination of all of those(although not as much schlock) and I think it was Journey's most consistent album. I don't know if it was the addition of Jonathan Cain but the songwriting went up several notches. No less than 5 of these songs can be heard on classic rock radio every day. The production is crisp and clear, unlike earlier Journey albums which sound a bit dated now. Neal Schon found his sound and sealed his guitar hero status. (Not that he wasn't capable before this.) If you only buy one album from Journey, excluding their Greatest Hits, this is quite possibly their finest record.
B000059XYK|1.0|I saw the original movie and it was GREAT! This so called remake offered to the public is not even close to the original. I watched it and finally realized that it was not a remake but a poor sequeal and not nearly as good as the first. The actors made several comments connecting the two movise and the basic plot was the same but it fell far short of the original. There is only one good stunt in the movie but in the original, there were dozens of stunts! However, if you have never seen the original then you may like this poor version.
B00005AR3H|5.0|I admit to not being very old, nor do I profess top be a Disney guru, but I have indeed seen every animated film that Disney has produced, and this one is one of my all time favorites. Others were funny as in &quot;Haha, Grumpy fell into the water!&quot; but this one was witty. It was together. It was darned funny. It has become one of the staple movies among folks at my university, up there with Monty Python and The Princess Bride, where one can randomly quote any line and others will react by laughing hysterically or quoting the next six word for word. &quot;Oh yeah... it's all coming together...&quot;
B00005OM4N|5.0|This is like, the greatest cd eva!  Britney is so grown up, she has really matured and now she's hotter than ever.  Everyone one thinks that \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" is her best song, and as great as it is, i have to disagree.  \\"I'm not a girl, Not yet a woman\\" shows how mature britney is, but it also shows she still has some innocence.  \\"I Love Rock n Roll\\" is a really slamming remix of Joan Jett's hit back in the 80's.  There are many other good songs on this album, but I don't want to blabber.  Go buy this cd, ya heard.  Peace.
B00005S6K8|5.0|Been waiting YEARS for this movie to come out on DVD.  I count it among my FAVORITE movies but REFUSED to buy the VHS, knowing that I would eventually have to toss it when they finally got around to the DVD.  I love this movie for so many reasons and will be overjoyed to finally add it to my collection sometime in Late January when it finally arrives out here from Amazon.com!
B00005KHJR|5.0|Leonard Maltin is correct - this is not a horror film.  In fact, it is very hard to classify; I can best describe it as a one-of-a-kind masterpiece.  Being a huge fan of unique films I love the Wicker Man, it is a superb example of storytelling, with not a line of script wasted, a startling performance by Woodward, and a near un-paralleled sense of dread, particularly towards the end.  Special mention should go to the hypnotic songs - they add to the atmosphere immensely.<br />Now, on to the disc.  I own the previous version of this DVD and the first disc in the package is that very same disc.  The extended version is what I bought the package for.  The film itself is complete - the extra footage frames the movie wonderfully; it is not just a case of scenes re-inserted, it is edited slightly differently too and the extra scenes make the film seem complete and even better than before.  It is not quite 102 minutes (though it is closer to 100 than 99), but there are a few seconds missing that are contained in the theatrical release, so I don't know whether these were part of the original print (though I'm not sure whether they would fit the slightly different story-line properly).  The main problem is the quality - when the new scenes are taking place the picture quality really is extremely bad, and so blindingly obvious I personally can't help but feel they should have kept the same poor quality all the way through.  That might seem silly but it is such a distraction when the new bits come on, at least if the quality remained the same the film would appear to be in it's original state rather than a tampered version, and you would ignore it eventually.   Still, this is an excellent film that fans should pick up - when it's all said, it still is the best version you can currently get of this magnificent film.
