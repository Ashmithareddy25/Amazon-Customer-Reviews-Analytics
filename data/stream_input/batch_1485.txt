0345803485|5.0|***Review based on 3/4 of Completion of This Novel!!***<br /><br />A family member \\"LOANED,\\" this PHENOMENAL book to me, because at the time I adamantly refused to purchase it. For exactly two reasons, I don't normally read what everyone else is--I tend to be my own judge of character and follow the beat of my own drum! And the other was I extremely support all the AMAZING authors who have written Erotic BDSM Romances before Ms. James, and thought their novels were SPECTACULAR! For example: Maya Banks'--Sweet Series, Cherise Sinclair--Master of the Mountain, & Lorelei James--Rough Riders Series--specially Cowboy Casanova!<br /><br />However, when I began to read the first chapter it was VIRTUALLY impossible to cease--I was HOOKED, REELED, & DEVOURED within minutes!<br /><br />I haven't read a series involving the same storyline with characters who continue their EXPLORATION into what \\"LOVE\\" might bring forth throughout all three books--since I've completed the Twilight Series 4 years ago. I ABSOLUTELY possess the exact same conviction as I do with the beginning of this CATASTROPHIC series as I did with that one!<br /><br />I'm IMMENSELY satisfied that Ms. Steele is stubborn and challenging Mr. Grey every step of the way, also concerning his extraordinary WICKED activities.<br /><br />I've invested an EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT to Ms. Steele and Mr. Grey, one of which I'm not ready to depart from as of yet! I'm OVERZEALOUS of the fact I truly won't have to until the final novel.<br /><br />My subconscious, she's SCREAMING at me from the top of her lungs, SCOLDING and ACCUSING me of being a HYPOCRITE, repeating to me--like a broken record, \\"I TOLD YOU SO!\\" While my inner goddess is secretly scribbling down notes!<br /><br />Ms. James with this novel undoubtedly you deserve NOTHING SHORT of a 10 STAR RATING!!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0425219437 Sweet Surrender]][[ASIN:0425227707 Sweet Persuasion]][[ASIN:0425230694 Sweet Seduction]][[ASIN:0425232581 Sweet Temptation (Heat)]][[ASIN:0425245659 Sweet Addiction]][[ASIN:1607379163 Master of the Mountain]][[ASIN:1611183758 Master of the Abyss]][[ASIN:B0068WH89U Cowboy Casanova]]425245659 Sweet Addiction]][[ASIN:1607379163 Master of the Mountain]][[ASIN:1611183758 Master of the Abyss]][[ASIN:B0068WH89U Cowboy Casanova]]
0345803485|4.0|I read all three books before writing this because it seemed people either loved it or hated it.<br />I understand that the author is a Twilight fan but this is a bit over the top.  The first 100+ pages are essentially a slight variation of characters I have already read about, know and love well.<br />We have Christian, who is beautiful, rich, plays sad classical music on the piano, has copper colored disheveled hair.  (apparently he even has to have the same hair). He and his siblings are all adopted and of course one of his parents is a doctor.  Unlike Edward, he is a total control freak, oh wait, that's just like Edward too.  He is demonized by his past and loathes himself, making him unable to be in a \\"normal\\" relationship.<br />We have Ana, with long brown hair, clumsy, not rich, and thinks she unattractive.  Her parents are also divorced, she has a flighty mom and she was raised by her step dad who is ex military vs. the cop. (Charlie). She too likes reading books and she works at the hardware store vs the camping store and one of the store owner's family members likes her too (Mike Newton).<br />We have Jose, who is Hispanic vs the Native American (Jacob Black), who is also in love with Ana.  Their dads are conveniently  friends.  Oh yeah, and the dads like fishing!<br />Of course, Christian saves her from the speeding bike vs. the van, and tracks her via cell phone vs. her scent.  Then we have the I'm having trouble staying away from you and Ana says \\"then don't\\".  Seriously!!!<br />Ok, so some would say the plot shifts at this pint, which it does SOME.. But you still have the \\"I don't know what you're thinking and you smell so good\\" etc.  He's even on her case about not eating.<br /><br />I agree with some of the other reviews where the sex scenes tend to be repetitive in the way they are written.  I go to the bathroom several times a day, but I don't need to know every detail every time.  They like to have sex with each other, we get it!<br />Ana can be alittle irritating, in this book, as you are constantly reading what she's thinking, oh my, inner goddes dancing, etc.  The author may be writing a little out of her age group as well.  I don't know any twenty-somethings who use Blackberrys!<br /><br />I gave this book 4 stars because it did keep me reading.  I wanted to find out what would happen next....although inevitably you kind of already know.  In order to fully understand this book, be prepared to read book 2.

B004NSULHM|4.0|... what we have come to expect from Radiohead.  Took me a while to get around to buying this recording -- the previous release was good, but did not leave me rushing out for the next disc.  Im glad I got around to it, though.  This is very well constructed album.  Very accessible, but still with the classic Radio innovation (those moments when you say \\"how did they think to put these sounds together this way.\\")  It'll have a solid place in my music rotation.  I think this record has been underrated overall.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|interesting graphics and fun, casual gameplay. there is an in game currency which you can buy with real money to make the game easier. developers have to make money somehow I guess.
0143120530|5.0|This was a great read.  It would seem hard to make a book on memorizing interesting to read but Foer does a terrific job.  He interviews a lot of interesting people including Kim Peck (Rainman) and spends some time going into the history of memorization.  This book will open your eyes (and mind) to ancient techniques that truly do work.  After reading, you will find yourself searching the internet for more details and information on becoming a 'mental athlete.'<br />Since reading this, I've learned to memorize names and faces and most recently, I was able to memorize the order of a shuffled deck of cards.

1401235417|5.0|Batman: The Court of Owls V. 1 is a fantastic rebooting of Batman, and should appeal to casual as well as hard-core fans.<br /><br />The story and art are both essential components of comics and graphic novels, and each is discussed in this review.<br /><br />The story is engaging and very interesting.  It starts with a bang, with Batman facing off against several members of his Rogues Gallery, a move which draws in long time readers and for newcomers, firmly establishes Batman as a physical force.  After that, the reader is immersed in Bruce Wayne's high society, and just that easily, the dual nature of the main character is established.  From there, writer Scott Snyder starts up with his own new plotline, in which he turns the history of Gotham City on its head, creating an all-new threat.  The Batman faces a foe who always seems one step ahead, and who is a physical match.  The pacing with which Snyder develops his story is fantastic, and readers will be swept along for the ride.<br /><br />Greg Capullo's artwork is truly beautiful.  Capullo captures emotion and action with great ease, and his drawing is truly art.  It will sound strange to make this distinction, but while I was absolutely blown away by the Batman scenes, whether action or in conversation, I was somewhat underwhelmed with the out of costume art, specifically the fact that Bruce Wayne looks almost identical to another character in the book, and Wayne's younger wards look so similar as to be drawings of a younger Bruce Wayne.  Given the skill with which Capullo draws, I am sure this was intentional, but it was pretty much the only thing about the book which was anything less than spectacular.<br /><br />By the end of the book, I was excited to read more, and see where else the team of Snyder and Capullo would take the characters.  At the end of the day, isn't that the way such a book should be judged?

B005LAIIS0|4.0|How you feel about endings may impact your opinion of this movie if you must have a happy conclusion.  This is not one of those movies.  As a friend of mine often says, \\"It is what it is\\".  Meaning take it for what it is because we can't always have what we want and we must use what we have.  Even survivalist will find some of it daunting.  Perhaps the cold and hunger affects their judgement because there are some mistakes made.  But then even in the best of conditions people prove they are only human every day.  Some perhaps expect perfect heroes that have all the answers, and they aren't in this movie.<br /><br />I enjoy survival movies and even with movies like [[ASIN:B000H7J9LM Eight Below [Blu-ray]]] that don't have the happiest of endings, you learn from the journey.  You will learn from it and Liam Neeson gives a magnificent performance.  He has perfected his craft and does a wonderful job of pulling us into this cruel wilderness that he must try to survive after a plane crash leaves him and a handful of passenegers alive and surrounded by giant gray wolves.  If you find yourself skeptical of their decisions or the wolves, I'd say you haven't done that much camping in the wild or you aren't familiar with this variety that kills for sport.  Not a day goes by when even smart people make the dumbest decisions that should make them candidates for the Darwin Awards.<br /><br />Keep in mind this group of survivors has no weapons, only fire to keep the wolves off them.  Add to that most of them are bleeding, and predators like wolves can certainly sense fear as well.  If you're still skeptical of the wolves size and behavior let me tell you I was until I found out it's not unrealistic at all.  I found articles about the large wolf packs in Canada that came from the introduction of 35 large Canadian gray wolves into Idaho and Yellowstone in Wyoming.  So those that tell you wolves aren't like this are basing their opinion on the smaller wolf varieties that were indigenous previously and now thought to be extinct in the United States.  Large packs of gray wolves are now roaming Northern US and they are aggressive enough to have not only attacked livestock, but humans in ever increasing numbers.  I recommend you see the movie if you enjoy movies like [[ASIN:B005FDWAXM Alive]] and [[ASIN:B000VDDWE2 The Day After Tomorrow [Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />CA Lusternous previously and now thought to be extinct in the United States.

B0084IG8TM|4.0|Among indie-film aficionados, 21-year-old Jennifer Lawrence has lent an impressive-for-her-years gravitas to a diverse array of roles in Guillermo Arriaga's [[ASIN:B002S5N052 The Burning Plain]] (2008), Drake Doremus's [[ASIN:B004Z29XEI Like Crazy]] (2011), and most memorably, Debra Granik's [[ASIN:B003EYVXTG Winter's Bone]] (2010). She showed up as Mystique, one of the [[ASIN:B004LWZW42 X-Men: First Class]] in the big-budget 2011 actioner last year, but it was her role as resourceful backwoods survivor Ree Dolly in \\"Winter's Bone\\" that appears to be the direct descendant of the heroine in this 2012 adrenalin rush of a movie - Katniss Everdeen, just sixteen but an expert archer living in District 12, the poorest of the dozen civilian sectors that make up the future state of Panem. Based on Suzanne Collins' hugely popular young-adult trilogy, Katniss' story is enmeshed in a dystopian society ruled by an unforgiving government seeking to provide penance to its downtrodden citizens through annual televised, \\"Survivor\\"-like bloodletting sports which give the movie its provocative title. Each event requires two \\"tributes\\" from each district, a boy and a girl, who must participate in a winner--takes-all survivalist match which means a likely violent death for the 23 others who must lose in the process.<br /><br />This gory concept is leavened by new-to-the genre Gary Ross' ([[ASIN:B00005JMCN Seabiscuit]]) surprisingly humanistic direction; a sometimes shrewd, sometimes silly screenplay by Ross, Collins and Billy Ray ([[ASIN:B0001907AI Shattered Glass]]); and a sharp cast combining the faces and fit bodies of young Hollywood with veterans who don't appear to be taking the proceedings too seriously. It's over 2 1/2 hours long, so the pacing has to be quicksilver, and Ross manages to keep the momentum up for most of the story. In the introductory sequence, District 12 is represented as a tableau of Dorothea Lange-style images reminiscent of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". Katniss lives with her passive mother and worshipful younger sister Prim. As fate would have it, Prim is chosen out of a raffle-like fishbowl to be the district \\"tribute\\" at which point Katniss unhesitantly volunteers to take her place. She is paired up with an oppressed baker's son named Peeta, who is more than willing to play by the rules to win the game. They are whisked off to the Capitol where along with the rest of the \\"tributes\\", they are groomed and trained in a style akin to \\"American Idol\\". This part of the movie is more predictably entertaining given the sly, satirical jabs at current reality-TV programming.<br /><br />Once the games finally begin in the forest, it becomes more of a standard adventure action yarn albeit with some clever twists that recall scenes from Peter Weir's underrated [[ASIN:B005DNPKSQ The Truman Show]]. However, the events start to feel by-the-numbers as the \\"tributes\\" meet their inevitable fates in orderly succession. Give Ross credit for not belaboring the violent elements in order to maintain the film's PG-13 rating. What I liked most about this part of the film was not so much the burgeoning relationship between Katniss and Peeta (which feels a bit more emotionally removed perhaps due to what may be coming in the sequels) but the poignant connection between Katniss and young Rue, which culminates into the film's most moving moments. Less effective are the handheld camerawork by Tom Stern and the agitated editing by Stephen Mirrione and Juliette Welfling, both elements making it sometimes difficult to figure out what is going on at any given moment. Moreover, the movie loses whatever social consciousness it had at the beginning save for one racially motivated scene of violence. In spite of these flaws, Lawrence gives the movie a much-needed soul as she drives the film's fanciful narrative through her stoic yet penetrating nature.<br /><br />Josh Hutcherson ([[ASIN:B003L20ICE The Kids Are All Right]]) doesn't makeas vivid an impression as Peeta but handles the role serviceably, while it seems fairly obvious Liam Hemsworth's curtailed role as Gale, the smitten boy Katniss leaves behind, will be more prominent in the sequel. Among the \\"tributes\\", Amandla Stenberg shines brightest in the spotlight role of Rue. More exaggerated turns are provided by Woody Harrelson as drunken mentor Haymitch Abernathy, Elizabeth Banks as garishly garbed escort Effie Trinket, and Stanley Tucci as preening blue-haired emcee Caesar Flickerman, a Ryan Seacrest-doppelganger. Relatively more subtle are Lenny Kravitz (complete with gold eyeliner) as Katniss' compassionate stylist Cinna, Wes Bentley as sinister show producer Seneca Crane, and a lionized Donald Sutherland as the President. Production designer Philip Messina and costume designer Judianna Makovsky deserve kudos, even though Katniss's flaming-red (literally) evening gown was underwhelming. For such an obvious franchise, the film manages to entertain for most of its running time, even if parts feel quite derivative of other films like [[ASIN:B0027V6AL8 The Running Man]] and even ancient relics like [[ASIN:0780022114 The Most Dangerous Game]]. It's a pretty effective start to the trilogy.as vivid an impression as Peeta but handles the role serviceably, while it seems fairly obvious Liam Hemsworth's curtailed role as Gale, the smitten boy Katniss leaves behind, will be more prominent in the sequel.

B007UW9WOQ|4.0|Located in a downtown Tokyo subway station, Sukiyabashi Jiro is an inconspicuous subterranean restaurant with just ten counter seats, yet it has the distinction of being the only sushi restaurant with a three-star Michelin rating. David Gelb's meticulously produced 2012 documentary tells the story of Jiro Ono, an octogenarian perfectionist whose constant striving for culinary transcendence has made him legendary among epicureans in the know. He loves his job, as he readily admits upfront, and while a model of stoic diligence and invariable routine, Ono does show his adoration in unexpected ways that manifest themselves through the unassuming pride he takes in his work. He even imagines new sushi creations in his sleep, thus the title. Such an unwavering quest does take its toll on his two sons who must find their way out of his shadow.<br /><br />His younger son Takashi managed to escape the constant glare of his father by running his own premium sushi restaurant in the Roppongi Hills area of Tokyo, one that doesn't bother to compete with his father's. His older son Yoshikazu, however, bears the burden of the family legacy as the one to carry on his father's standards after he retires. Over fifty and still an apprentice, Yoshikazu patiently waits for his turn at running the flagship restaurant foregoing earlier dreams of becoming a race car driver. Since his father suffered a heart attack at seventy, he has taken over the critical task of getting the best fish possible at the world-renowned Tsukiji fish market. Gelb does a particularly nice job of showing the hurly-burly atmosphere of the pre-dawn tuna auctions and the lives of the men running the tiny stalls selling fresh seafood of all kinds. Perhaps by design, the film is comparatively more opaque in having us understand the genesis of the elder Ono's drive toward perfection.<br /><br />While one contributing factor was the absence of Ono's father's absence, it is unclear who actually did influence him to become a sushi chef. There is also hardly a mention of the chef's wife, even though there is an extended passage of a reunion with his childhood pals who characterize him as something of a bully. Interviews with former co-workers shed some light onto the chef's stoicism. In fact, one of Japan's better known food critics admits to being intimidated by patronizing Ono's sushi bar due to the master's overwhelming artistry and attention to detail. Toward that end, I would have liked to have seen more scenes focused on the actual preparation of the sushi rather than simply admiring them on the counter once they are finished. Still, this is a unique look into a man who has not gone gentle into the good night in his quest for the perfect piece of sushi.a sushi chef.

B00782O7IY|4.0|To state that French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius appreciates the artistry and emotional appeal of classic silent cinema would be a severe understatement. He devours it like only a true cineaste would and brings a unique deftness to such a long-forgotten medium that he singlehandedly brings it back to life if only for this one instance. Mostly silent with title cards and shot entirely black-and-white, this stylish 2011 dramedy starts in 1927 Hollywood as pre-Depression audiences were still enraptured by the heart-palpitating derring-do of matinee idols like Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. and John Gilbert on the silver screen. As Norma Desmond said in [[ASIN:B00003CXCW Sunset Boulevard]], \\"We didn't need dialogue. We had faces then.\\" And indeed Hazanavicius has found the appropriate doppelganger in his constant star Jean Dujardin portraying an amalgam of Fairbanks, Gilbert and Rudolph Valentino with a touch of Charlie Chaplin (notable in his comic scenes with the dog) and a little Gene Kelly-style hoofing thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Dujardin plays George Valentin, one of the silent screen's leading lights whose charming braggadocio is more than offset by his popularity. At the premiere of his latest romantic espionage caper, he has a \\"meet-cute\\" run-in with the fittingly named Peppy Miller, a pretty extra fumbling for her autograph book on the red carpet. He is immediately impressed with her beauty as well as her moxie, and in another \\"meet-cute\\" run-in, by her terpsichorean talent as well. Once their mutual attraction is established, the plot follows a standard [[ASIN:B003B3V0X4 A Star Is Born]] storyline by showing his career in decline while hers is on a fast rise with the advent of talkies. There is a buoyant spirit that infuses the story and sideswipes the more tragic elements one would expect from previous versions of this tale. That's how Hazanavicius manages to engage the viewer even though the film slows considerably during the middle section despite his meticulous efforts. There are also recognizable tributes to silent classics like F.W. Murnau's [[ASIN:B0002DCHQA Sunrise]] and King Vidor's [[ASIN:7885726967 The Crowd]] and even a wink to the classic breakfast montage in Orson Welles' [[ASIN:B0050G3NWG Citizen Kane]] to illustrate how Valentin and his icy wife drift apart.<br /><br />Some of Valentin's most vulnerable moments are beautifully rendered like the puddle of liquor on the glass table, his window reflection against the tuxedoed torso of a mannequin, and a sure-to-be-classic nightmare scene where he hears every sound except his own voice. The movie jumps back to life with a surprisingly exhilarating ending that subtly explains the key dramatic point of the story. Dujardin immerses himself completely into the essence of his embattled, vainglorious character without a trace of irony. It's a genuinely exquisite performance that could have easily disintegrated into self-parody in less assured hands. What's more, the man can really dance. B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo (who also happens to be the director's wife) is lovely and vivacious as Peppy, although there are moments when she comes across as a mite too contemporary to be truly convincing as a period character. Take, for example, the fist pump she shows when she wins her first audition. At the same time, when she puts an arm through the sleeve of a jacket on a hanger and caresses herself with a hand she imagines to be his, she handles this piece of pantomime with true aplomb.<br /><br />The two French stars are surrounded by familiar American faces like John Goodman as a Jack Warner-like, cigar-chomping producer; James Cromwell as Valentin's dutiful chauffeur; Penelope Ann Miller as Valentin's shingle-haired, ignored wife Doris; and Missi Pyle as a Lina Lamont-style starlet, appropriate since this film covers the same fertile ground as [[ASIN:B00006DEF9 Singin' in the Rain]]. By the way, that's Uggie who plays the playful, clever Jack Russell terrier, an obvious paean to Asta from [[ASIN:B0009GX1C4 The Thin Man]] series. Kudos also need to be given to Guillaume Schiffman's accurately evocative cinematography (unlike other pastiches, the film looks like it was made in 1927), Laurence Bennett's production design (including an inventive use of the vintage Bradbury Building in downtown LA), and Ludovic Bource's swooning music score, which includes a snatch of Bernard Hermann's [[ASIN:B000ICXQG0 Vertigo]] score over a climactic scene. Even with all the praise heaped on this film from the critics, it's not for everyone's tastes. Silent cinema, by its very nature, beckons a certain patience from the audience that some will find tedious, and even at a running time of just 100 minutes, the movie still feels a bit long. At the same time, for those who can appreciate it as an art form, Hazanavicius has really delivered quite a treat.o Asta from [[ASIN:B0009GX1C4 The Thin Man]] series.

B006M7JCC2|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone interested in near death experiences. My son died of cancer and it caught my interest as to how she was chosen to to return and live here life again.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|This is a fantastic movie that should not be missed.  All of the acting is superb.  I still get chills just thinking about the series and then finding the movie just laying around for me to watch.  Highly recommended!
B006VRZ5YM|5.0|Ana Faris is quirky and funny in this movie - she really carries the humor throughout the film. But Chris Evans holds his own, and is rather endearing. I had low expectations, but this far surpassed them. A fun and light movie!

B007B6VOG0|5.0|The albums from this band remind me of the early Beatles albums, kinda Sgt Pepperish. Both of their albums are set up in a story telling format which is very rare to see these days. For this group their music is truly an art, not just what they do. There is a purpose behind it. I can see these easily being taught in the college History of Rock n Roll class right along side the other epic story albums.
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|I started out as a die-hard R.E.M fan back in the early nineties, just as they were on the cusp of releasing OUT OF TIME. It was early 1991, I was sixteen, and I had just heard GREEN in its entirety for the first time. I started devouring some of their previous albums, like DOCUMENT and LIFE'S RICH PAGEANT (my favorite of the IRS years), and then out came OUT OF TIME, which to date is still my favorite R.E.M album, despite its one major misstep of the exclusion of \\"Fretless\\" and the inclusion of \\"Shiny Happy People\\". Over the years I kept buying their older albums as well as imports and bootlegs and then of course, each new album in succession. Things were looking great with AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE, MONSTER, and NEW ADVENTURES IN HI-FI, but once Bill had decided to retire from the band, it was very much like losing the pulse of the band (with Peter being the heart, Mike being the brain and Michael being the soul). Thus began what I have dubbed their \\"Dream\\" era, with the albums UP, REVEAL and AROUND THE SUN. These albums were, on the whole, a distinct departure from the R.E.M of old, but it still yielded one excellent album (UP), one very good album (REVEAL) and one pretty bad album that has one of their best songs ever (AROUND THE SUN; \\"Leaving New York\\"). When ACCELERATE was announced, this was supposed to be a hard-rocking return to the glory days of R.E.M, but this ultimately led to something of a disappointment to me. I felt that ACCELERATE, for all its sonic bluster, was still something of a snooze of an album with only songs like \\"Living Well is the Best Revenge\\", \\"Until the Day is Done\\" and \\"I'm Gonna DJ\\" being the real highlights. I think even at that point that the band new that the party was close to ending, and even they were somewhat disappointed by that album (which is of course only speculation). This very possibly led to them recording what would be their best album since MONSTER, but would also sadly be their final album.<br /><br />That album is COLLAPSE INTO NOW.<br /><br />From the very beginning of the album, you knew that you were in for something special; something that was more like the R.E.M that most of us fell in love with in the late 80's/early 90's. \\"Discoverer\\" is easily the most anthemic opening track on one of their albums since \\"What's The Frequency, Kenneth?\\". \\"All the Best\\" is another hard-driving song that in retrospect from its initial pre-breakup-announcement release seems to be a song about passing the torch to a new young and independently-minded generation of musicians, with lyrics like \\"We'll show the kids how to do it fine, fine, fine\\". \\"Uberlin\\" is a song of joy and movement, and in a typical R.E.M fashion ends on something of a melancholy note. \\"Oh My Heart\\" is Michael's sorrowful and impassioned cry to the heavens about New Orleans post-Katrina. It's a very moving song, and it fits his poetic/social narrative without being heavy-handed. \\"It Happened Today\\" is not the best song on the album, but it is certainly its most glorious. This is the closest song that R.E.M has had to a religious experience with its sparse lyrics growing into something initially pleasantly harmonic and continues to grow to explosion into a beautiful and wild whilrling of vocalization from Michael, Mike and guest vocalist Eddie Vedder. It's a cacophony of uncut and mainlined joy. \\"Every Day is Yours to Win\\" is a little on the hammy side, and it's not the most memorable of the cuts on the album. \\"Mine Smell Like Honey\\" is a little sexy and a little fun and it's a happy-go-lucky jam that's very tuneful; it's kind of like the \\"Supernatural Superserious\\" of this album. \\"Walk It Back\\" is a very sobering song with some beautiful piano work as well as some beautiful singing by Michael. \\"Alligator_Aviator_Autopilot_Antimatter\\" is easily the strangest song on the album but it's also the most fun in its pulse-pounding rhythm section capped off by a very entertaining duet with Michael and the artist Peaches. It's an extraordinarily silly song that shows that even in their 50's, R.E.M still knows how to have fun. \\"That Someone Is You\\" is a peppy and poppy post-modern ditty that's brief but leaves you smiling ear-to-ear. \\"Me, Marlon Brando, Marlon Brando and I\\" is a very standard near-album-closing track that's more introspective and darker and filled with more longing than most of the previous songs. By saying it's a standard of R.E.M's doesn't diminish the power of the track, because it's quite beautiful. However, I began to worry the first time I heard this album because when the final track began, I was concerned that the finale of the album might be too dark. That final track is \\"Blue\\", which is a strange, unforgettable and impossibly beautiful hybrid of \\"Country Feedback\\" (the best R.E.M song ever written), \\"E-Bow The Letter\\" and \\"Belong\\". It begins with an undercurrent of three-chord acoustic guitar overlapped with a distorted electric solo, and an organ and piano join in as well as we hear Michael doing an echoey spoken-word poetry rather than singing. Soon after that begins, another layer is added on as Patti Smith lends her powerful, haunting voice over Michael's. As the song seems to fade, my fears of the album ending on a somber note were dispatched as a single electric guitar slowly rose with a blasting power-chord reminiscent in sound and tune of \\"Turn You Inside Out\\" that eventually became the opening chords of \\"Discoverer\\" as the song plays out, and we are treated to a reprise of the finale of that song as well. It practically demands that you listen to the whole album from the beginning again.<br /><br />Most of the lower-star reviews fan-wise seem to be from people who have been following them from the beginning or who prefer the earlier IRS years as opposed to the Warner years. Personally, I can say without any doubt in my mind that this was a band that peaked during their years at Warner with the quadfecta of GREEN, OUT OF TIME, AFTP and MONSTER. Whether that makes me one of the \\"bad\\" R.E.M fans or not, it doesn't matter. Bands are allowed to grow and evolve. While these albums may not have what had been established as the \\"R.E.M sound\\", it also shows how a band can grow and become even better without ignoring or fully incorporating the sound that came before. I loved pretty much all of their work, and I loved all of them, but no band that lasts this long has a flawless record. But what R.E.M proved with COLLAPSE INTO NOW is that you can still kick @$$ after 30 years in the business and still be edgy and different and not just easy-listening garbage (I'm looking at you, U2).<br /><br />I'm still hacked off though because these guys announced their break-up one day before my 37th birthday. Happy freakin' birthday to me...traordinarily silly song that shows that even in their 50's, R.E.M still knows how to have fun. \\"That Someone Is You\\" is a peppy and poppy post-modern ditty that's brief but leaves you smiling ear-to-ear. \\"Me, Marlon Brando, Marlon Brando and I\\" is a very standard near-album-closing track that's more introspective and darker and filled with more longing than most of the previous songs.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read the first book rather quickly.  The book is an easy read, a no brainer, and if nothing else, it might put you in a mood for sex.  In the first book, you get to know the characters, which I found stereotyped to the extreme.  The naïve university student meets the more than handsome \\"gazillionaire\\".  She is naïve, but strong willed, and he, by all appearances is perfect.  Once you know enough about the characters, the rest of the story gets very predictable.  However, the only character that really worked for me is Anastasia's (the main character) inner goddess.  This part is well written.  She proves to be entertaining, but after a while, this too becomes old news and predictable.<br />The second book is more of the same, and it took me a lot longer to read.  I will skip the third book.  The writing is very average if not too simple.  The repetitions are overwhelming.  I don't know how many times one can \\"hiss\\", it is way too repetitive, and it becomes annoying.  I would attribute that to the fact that this is not her line of work.<br />An easy read, but no \\"wow\\" factor.

B005HYNCTK|5.0|It's not wrong to give this a five-star rating, but there is a huge caveat that must come with it:  ONLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY BRUCKNER TRUE BELIEVERS.  There is no doubt that Celidibache is a visionary conductor of Bruckner's visionary symphonies.  His interpretations can only be considered \\"extremist,\\" as they are about 5 standard deviations from the norm.  That doesn't mean that Celibidache's interpretations don't \\"work\\" on their own non-conforming terms.  But I would argue, strongly, that this is not how Bruckner is meant to be heard day-in, day-out.  Rather, this is a nice complement, a set that dives deep into the spiritual depths of Bruckner yet still manages to come up for air in the end--but just barely.<br /><br />The issue with these performances is that Celidibache takes them at insanely slow speeds, far beyond what anyone is used to hearing.  You can call these tempos \\"labored\\" (and they are), yet Celibidache does mange to brilliantly build over the long-term and sustain these crazily-slow tempos (I have not yet listened to the 8th, however, so I reserve judgement on that performance until I get the time to hear it, because it is probably the most extreme performance of this whole bunch).<br /><br />The 4th and 6th symphonies in this set are the easiest to digest.  The 5th is not that much slower than Karajan's legendary performance, although it's definitely not superior to it.  The 9th is also a memorable performance, but again, quite a bit slower than Giulini's definitive (and very slow) recording of the 9th with the Vienna Philharmonic ([[ASIN:B000001GAM Bruckner: Symphonie No. 9]]).  The 7th just barely holds together, but still manages to.  The Te Deum is OK, but definitely not as impactful as my favorite Te Deum from Bernard Haitink and the Vienna Philharmonic.  I don't care for the Mass in F-minor, and Celi's recording doesn't make me any more of a believer in that work.<br /><br />The Munich Philharmonic gives Celibidache 100% of what he asks for from them.  You can not fault their playing or their commitment to Bruckner as well as to Celibidache.<br /><br />At his best, Celi does bring some illuminations into Bruckner and his music.  Celi's Bruckner is worth listening to if you are already convinced by Bruckner's music.  But this is definitely NOT the appropriate starting point for a newcomer to become acquainted with Bruckner.<br /><br />And where is the right starting point?  That's easy:  [[ASIN:B001DCQI8W Bruckner: 9 Symphonies [Box Set]]]<br /><br />Herbert von Karajan would get my vote as the greatest Bruckner conductor of all-time.  His box set of the Bruckner symphonies is my most prized possession in a classical CD collection that approaches 1,500.  It is completely astonishing what Karajan and the Berliners achieve in their amazing box set:  Inspired interpretations that go right to the soul of these absolutely magnificent symphonies, consistent orchestral playing of beauty, balance, and stature that seems almost impossible to have achieved, and music-making at a level that is peerless.  You can not go wrong with Karajan's Bruckner box set, and it's definitely the place to start (as well as finish, for that matter).<br /><br />Celibidache's set is a nice complement to Karajan's, and Celidibache does have something special to say about Bruckner that is unique for those who already understand and appreciate the magnificence of Bruckner's music.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I found this DVD on my own DVD shelves and can't recall how it got there. Probably my wife bought it. In any case, it was my late-night movie yesterday and I enjoyed it very much. It's \\"The King's Speech\\" and stars Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush. A little sticker on the DVD case says it received four Academy Awards including best picture. That's easy to understand. This is an exceptionally well done movie and well worth watching.<br /><br />The movie took place in the mid- to late-thirties, just as WWII is getting underway, At that same time, the King of England was fading away and in need of a replacement. The son due to move up was more interested in his twice-divorced wife and abdicated, turning over the throne to the next younger brother who ultimately became King George VI. However, this new-king brother (Bertie) had a life-long speech impediment of badly stammering and stuttering, a rather un-kingly affliction. Bertie had tried numerous therapists, all unsuccessful, but finally settled on an Australian man (Lionel), who, as was later found out, had no official credentials. The story depicted the new king's affliction, his pairing with Lionel, the conflicts that developed and his final triumph and inaugural speech. It's a moving story and quite well done. The settings are magnificent and the photography of such was excellent. The sound score was excellent. As the movie began and went through it's first third, it had the typical stiff and formal British acting and this took a while to adjust to, at least for me. Afterwards, the people became real and quite human. I almost felt that I struggled with the new king as he grappled with handling the language. But finally, there was a triumph. The king stepped out onto a balcony and was greeted by the applause of thousands. It was quite moving.<br /><br />This movie was a very interesting and well done period piece and it's all based on a true story. The settings, costumes and old cars were just magnificent and the film was worth viewing for that alone. However, the story was also quite gripping and the acting was absolutely first rate.<br /><br />Gary Petersonwas worth viewing for that alone. However, the story was also quite gripping and the acting was absolutely first rate.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B002T9H2LA|3.0|Major newspaper reviews ranged from 2 1/2 to 5 stars, and that pretty much captures my own feeling about this film. I felt there was a pretty good, serious movie about occupied France, especially well done in the opening \\"chapter\\" that introduces us to Landa (Christoph Walsh). A great deal of the movie, however, was intentionally over the top and, of course, it vears off into an alternative history universe that, in my opinion, seemed tagged onto the story in a rather slapdash way. There are two styles woven together throughout: extravagant gore as in the Basterds scalpings of German dead, and cat and mouse conversations usually but not exclusively conducted by Landa. Whether the juxtoposition of these styles works is, I suppose, a matter of individual taste. It didn't for me. There can be no doubt that Tarentino had fun with this film, but one hopes that he will eventually outgrow his fascination with the minor film genres of the past.

0545265355|5.0|I read this book because my daughter kept raving about the violence in the book. So, I wanted to see if she had become obsessed with brutality  Yet, I think the author did an excellent job of incorporating the concept of bloodshed into the story for such young readers.  More importantly, I think she mocked our society,  \\"The Hunger Games\\" are happening everyday on streets with our teenagers.  For instance, on the streets of Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia young males are playing their own version of the \\"Hunger Games\\" they are killing one another at alarming rate. Sadly, Americans can''t wait to turn on the TV and see the results of The Hunger Games every day.

B000GDH9JQ|5.0|This is a classic film for dance lovers.  It takes in the historical Leningrad and back to the time of the Iron Curtin and the plane crash scene is one of the best even considering the lack of special effects.  Isabella Rossolini is perfect for this role as is Helen Mirren, actually all the actors are good.  But the best part of this film is Mikhail Barishnikov and Gregory HInes, they are magic together and the dancing is magnifique!  This is all the more special because of the loss of Gregory HInes, he was an amazing dancer..its a wonderful union of modern jazz and tap and ballet.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|First, I would like to say that I am not a huge science fiction reader. I have read some dystopian fiction that I have liked but not loved. Having said that I loved the wool series. I read none stop over a 48 hr. period of time getting maybe 5 hrs of sleep total in that 48 hrs. I just could not put it down. Each book got better and better. The plot was incredibly original but, at the same time you could see how this world that these people live in could come to be. Wool kept you on the edge of your seat wondering with each plot twist what was going to happen next. In no way was this series predictable. Hugh's description of this world on the inside and out was so detailed it was like you were there. I had no problem picturing everything clearly as the story went along. All the above alone would make this a great book but, where Hugh's real talent lies is with his incredible character development. His description of a character is so detailed you feel like you really know this person. You become invested in there lives, relationships, families and jobs. You come to care for them and you need to know what happens next. As the book goes on all of these characters lives become intertwined with each other. There is suspence, intrigue and conspiracy. This book makes you think, even when you finish, you will keep these characters with you for a while. I can not wait to read any thing else Mr. Howey has wrote.

They told me they couldn't hear me, so after awhile of fiddling with the equipment and turning up and down the volume, it could barely pick me up. I'm a relatively loud speaker, so me being quiet wasn't an issue. It was the headphones! I do not recommend this product to people who plan on using the microphone.

B0074VTHKM|1.0|This book was a true disappointment but is probably fine for pre-teens. The plot line is unexciting except, probably, for those kids in middle school. It should be advertised as a children's book. Grisham's main character and hero is a 12 year old 'lawyer' -  a far-fetched notion in the first place and the storyline is pretty basic, showing none of the intensity of Grisham's earlier books. Boring is a good way to describe it but if you have nothing to do for the 2 hours it takes to read it, it might be ok for you. The worst part was at the end where you find out Grisham is working on a sequel. What's happened to the John Grisham that we all know and love?

B005LAIGN2|2.0|In fulfilling his career dream to create a Hollywood epic in tribute to a group of men who deserve tribute, George Lucas succumbed to the pull of Hollywood cliché to instead render a computer graphic cartoon of legendary men!  As a retired USAF pilot, I understand how airplanes fly, but mostly I understand how men perform in aerial combat operations.  Trivial, even jovial discussions on the formation radio, such as repeatedly shown in this movie, were simply not done.  For many reasons this is true, but principally because the radio was a tool for mission success.  Survival and basic air discipline required that the radio be used to support the mission.  The sort of bravado talk these actors carried out in the air was reserved for after the mission and after the debriefing, when the pilots assembled in the bar.<br /><br />I could have forgiven this as an artistic license, but to reveal a squadron commander who routinely drank alcohol immediately before flying a sortie, and an ace pilot who routinely disobeyed orders and questioned his commander on the formation radio, was simply too much to bear!  It was a travesty carried out upon men who above all else were professional officers.  Their senior commanders would never have tolerated such lapses in discipline.  While it may have fit Lucas' desire for drama, it rendered his movie a hugely disappointing effort!<br /><br />Movie critics have panned the film for these reasons -- rightfully so.  But, as someone who grew up loving aviation and who studied aviation history with intense personal interest, and admired the true story of the Tuskegee Airmen, I was profoundly disappointed with this movie.  Lucas had a once in a lifetime opportunity to translate his enviable Hollywood clout and resources into a movie that had the courage to resist the Hollywood \\"treatment.\\" He could have rendered a movie fit to be mentioned in the same breath as \\"The Longest Day,\\" \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" or even the HBO mini-series, \\"Band of Brothers.\\"  None of these three classic movies lacked for drama and interest, but they certainly did not sacrifice essential elements of truth and accuracy to achieve it.  \\"Band of Brothers\\" in particular struck a perfect chord by telling the real story, and validated that the real story carries more than enough drama to hold an audience's interest.  Lucas merely needed the courage to tell the real story, and of all people in Hollywood, he had the influence to ensure the real story was the only one told.  The failure to do this is entirely his own!<br /><br />The men of the Tuskegee Airmen deserved better!  George Lucas made it clear he intended this movie to be a tribute, and one must take him at his word.  Tragically for him, and disappointingly for us, the only aspect of this movie that is epic is the epic failure!  Lucas aimed to create a masterpiece in keeping with the immortal men who flew and fought with such skill as to earn praise from those who know best their actual exploits.  If only he had!
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love this movie as i love all the Twilight movies, if you have never seen them u should, their great!

B006X96PF6|5.0|I was very pleased with this cd.  The music is soft and has a wonderful calming effect.  I would recommend this to a friend.
B00005QENZ|5.0|I always enjoyed the earlier aerosmith the best and still do but this one is a fine effort. I can say that it's a great cd of rock n roll and one of the better rock cd's out that year imo.  It was a long wait between the classic 'pump' and this one. THis may not be a classic but it's got solid hooks and cool songs. It's got great ballads and driving rockers too. The boys wouldn't put out another studio release until 'nine lives' which is a good one but not as solid as this one imo.  They are finally putting out a new one in 2012 and that's something to look forward too inspite of 19 years between this strong release and it. I can say that as a aerosmith fan that this one was more enjoyable to me than 'done with mirrors' , and 'rock in a hard place' and those came before this one. So it was a high point for them.  This was a band still at their peak in many ways , and it was the third really strong release in a row.  'permanant vacation' and 'pump' being the other two peaks at that point. Like I said I love the earlier stuff better but this was still a fine point in the bands history.  Songs like the hit 'amazing' and cool ones like 'line up' just lay down some good rockin grooves here.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I heard the name of the book at a meeting I was attending.  The person who mentioned the book is in a book club and usually reads books with more character and depth so  after also seeing the title on the best seller list I decided I would purchase it.  What a waste of money.  Monotonous barely describes how bored I was with this book.  I skipped over many pages of the same thing over and over again and that did not include only the lewd passages.  The sequels will not be purchased by me.  A waste of time and money.

I have also purchased another book from this author because he writes in a way that is very easy to read and comprehend.  Great Book, you will not regret reading it.

B005LAIHSG|2.0|\\"Snow White\\" was originally a European fairy tale made famous as one of the Grimm Brothers 1812 collection. It appeared in a 1916 silent film and a 1933 Betty Boop cartoon before achieving eternal fame in the 1937 Disney animated feature. That film was the first full length animated feature, was #1 at the box office in 1938, won an Honorary Oscar, and earned a spot (#49) on AFIs list of the best films of all time.<br /><br />Since 1937 the story has been reprised on occasion - \\"Snow White and the 3 Stooges\\" (1961), \\"Snow White\\" (1987), \\"Snow White: A Tale of Terror\\" (1997), \\"Sydney White\\" (2007), and \\"Mirror Mirror\\" (2012).<br /><br />The most recent version, \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" is a 2012 fantasy with Charlise Theron as the wicked queen, Kristen Stewart as Snow White, and Chris Hemsworth as the huntsman.<br /><br />South Africa born Charlise Theron is the Oscar winning actress (\\"Monster\\" 2003) who has been in more than two dozen films including \\"North Country\\" (2005), \\"The Italian Job\\" (2003), and \\"Men of Honor\\" (2000). Her role as the wicked queen is one of her worst performances ever.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart is best known from the \\"Twilight Saga\\" films. The buck toothed tom boy is certainly attractive, but no beauty, and far from the \\"fairest in the land.\\" Indeed Charlise Theron clearly retains the title.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth is best known as \\"Thor\\" from the film of the same name and the subsequent \\"The Avengers\\" (2012). He should probably stick with this genre. His performance is uneven, and he certainly doesn't fill the need for a hero in a film like this.<br /><br />The script is all inclusive - they not only manage to keep much of the original story, they add gigantic trolls, gnomes, a tribe of women without men, fairies, a 20 point white antelope, and 8 dwarfs. That's right - 8. Count `em yourself. One dies, so in the end there are only 7.<br /><br />This is such a bad film, and it goes on for hours and hours, the only redeeming quality is some beautiful photography. There are some nice special effects, as when the wicked queen seems to be composed of a group of crows. But they overuse this special effect - trees consist of butterflies, the antelope consists of white birds - so that it gets tiresome after awhile.<br /><br />In the end, the story itself cannot be resolved, but I can't reveal this without spoiling the film for those who choose to see it. But I can't imagine who that would be. It's not suitable for kids, and there's not enough action for adrenaline junkies, nor enough fantasy for the sword and sorcery crowd. Fans of romance will also be disappointed, and people looking for the dark side will probably not find enough darkness here.<br /><br />Bottom line - a poor film that doesn't do justice to the story nor to the excellent 1937 film.some beautiful photography.

0060873027|2.0|Then he failed miserably with this effort.  I've been reading Crichton novels since Congo and while I loved his usual extrapolation of potential science gone mad, I couldn't stand the wooden characters, the uninspired phrasing and predictable dialogue.  Some characters (particularly Danny Minot) are downright insufferable.  Mr Preston had a great opportunity to correct these flaws and he decided to take a pass.<br /><br />Crichton himself has done better in the past.  Pirate Lattitudes is a much better-told story - it's the way Crichton's career block of work should have book-ended (no pun intended).
B005USZYDU|4.0|What an amazing story.  Except for size and age, this \\"kid\\" could be an attorney.  Good read.  Theodore actually uses skills that many lawyers only could wish they have!
B007SSEU9O|3.0|Did I say boring already? There are just some days you want to sit down and watch something that is entertaining. I found this to be rather slow and boring. There was nothing in this movie that captivated me. Acting was good and as usual, Meryl Streep captured the role, but it just didn't have any bells or whistles for me....
B005USZML4|4.0|A good read in which I became Theodore as I went along, also learned more about the law.  Recommend to others.

B005D5FJJ4|5.0|The book is one of the best reads I've encountered in a long time. It's not your usual Stephen King \\"Enemy-in-the-dark\\" type of book.  It follows a little girl who has become lost in the woods, and how she beats death along the way.  Many of us have experienced moments of feeling lost or of being disoriented and this story brings out those fears which we remember and reminds us of the lonliness and frustration when we wants to be back with the ones who had previously been nothing more than nagging pests, like minges and noseeums, as Mr. King calls them.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for one of those books that you can't put down after you start reading.

0307888908|5.0|\\"All human beings are entrepreneurs. When we were in the caves, we were all self-employed. We were finding our food, we're feeding ourselves. That's where the human history began with. As civilization came, we suppressed it and made it into labor. We are all labor.\\" Muhammad Yunnus<br /><br />I read the start-up of YOU by Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha this week. That quote by Yunnus starts of the first chapter and it's been running through my mind for the past several days. It's funny. We learned to be labor, it's something that has been taught to us and over time we have evolved into being labor instead of entrepreneurs. I find this funny because I, like many people around the world, am going to school to learn entrepreneurship.<br /><br />I'm glad I read this book because Hoffman and Casnocha have the right frame of mind. We are all entrepreneurs, we just have to exploit that side of ourselves.<br /><br />This book in a nutshell is about relationships. One of the best ideas in this book is that it is people that do things for you. A person hired you, a person introduced you to the person that got you your job, and a person will decide to invest in your Venture. It's not the business or organization. It's the people. That is why it's so important to connect and build relationships. You can have all the best ideas in the world but if the only person you are telling it to is your fish then you aren't going to be the next Steve Jobs.<br /><br />Reid Hoffman is the co-founder and chairman of LinkedIn, so he sees first hand how the 'new world' connects and builds relationships. And the book is not about LinkedIn at all, but I think LinkedIn is a perfect way to build relationships. You can clearly see who you need to talk to in your circle to communicate with someone you want. There is a lot of truth to six degrees of separation and LinkedIn is a platform that shows you who those people in the middle are.<br /><br />The book talks about capitalizing on opportunities and establishing competitive advantages and really does offer great steps to do those things. But any book on Entrepreneurship is going to touch on those issues. This books main strength is the walkthrough of building up your network and maintaining diverse relationships. Because in today's fastpaced world, it's going to be those that are best connected that will have an easier time succeeding.<br /><br />I do recommend this book.establishing competitive advantages and really does offer great steps to do those things.

1609613937|5.0|I wanted to wait to rate this until I had tried the program for 30 days (I'm only 5 days into it), but I'm going to go ahead and give it 5 stars now just for how interesting it is.  Who would have thought a health book could be such a page turner?  Dr. McDougall makes such a strong case for eating this way.  I'm just wondering if it is really possible to eat all of this starch and lose weight!  I've been getting pulled toward a plant-strong diet over the past few months as I've watched, \\"Forks over Knives,\\" \\"Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead,\\" plus reading \\"Eat to Live,\\" \\"Engine 2 Diet,\\" \\"The Pleasure Trap,\\" and so forth.  They all point towards eliminating animal products and eating plant-strong whole foods.  I've been trying to follow the \\"Eat to Live\\" program but it is challenging because a)you only get one starchy vegetable/serving of grains a day; b)The 2-pound recommendation of non-starchy veggies is challenging to meet; c)no salt is allowed and that combined with no oil makes it so hard for me to enjoy my food.  I guess that is why \\"The Starch Solution\\" appeals to me so much, SOME salt is allowed and I love starchy veggies and whole grains.  However, the non-fat aspect of it doesn't seem quite healthy either.  Dr. Fuhrman makes a strong case for including fatty foods such as nuts and seeds every day for good health.  So, I find myself wondering, do I eat some fat or no fat?  Do I eat 2 fruits a day (McDougal) or 4 (Fuhrman)?  Can I really lose weight eating all of this starch?<br /><br />Report so far--my husband has lost 5 pounds in 5 days and I haven't lost any.  (He did a major food switch, going from eating lots of meat every day to this.  I've been easing into this way of eating for several months).  My biggest challenge is I'm eating a ton but still feeling hungry so much of the time.  I'm eating oatmeal, potatoes, corn, beans, brown rice, etc.  I feel satisfied after a meal, but then I feel hungry in an hour or two.  I made a big pot of Indian curry with potatoes, chick peas, green peas, carrots, etc. (loaded with \\"healthy starch).  I ate 3 bowls plus salad and fruit and was hungry for more not long after!  Anyway, I'm hoping to find a way to stay satisfied without eating so much so often.  I really want to lose weight and I can't imagine it happening with eating this much.  I will update this report after we finish our 30 days.

B003Y5H53S|3.0|This movie had sooo much potential to be a great one, but sunk down! The animation was great for the background and humans, but the animal animation was not very good. I loved the language and the old Western style. It was very funny at times and I LOLed pretty hard. The thing that does not make this movie great is the plot. The plot is weird and not clear at all. I mean, it felt more like a mystery movie than a Western. It was still okay and kinda recommended for the family if Westerns are suitable.
B005LZW8FO|4.0|I watched  this movie at least 4 or 5 times. I knew there was a deeper meaning by understanding the \\"Another Earth\\". I felt there was so many unresolved questions by the way the movie ended. The strange twists towards the end of the movie really perplexed me. I would set the movie aside for several days, even months and then watch it again.<br /><br />Both Rhoda and John Burroughs are psychologically damaged after the tragedy that both were involved in. Rhoda and John come to find great comfort in each other. But, John doesn't know who Rhoda really is. She's the person that caused the tragedy that killed Johns wife and son. Rhoda really wants to apologize for the unforgivable tragedy, but she's unable to because of the shame and weakness she feels. The comfort that John and Rhoda are experiencing together is based upon a deep and shameful lie that prevents redemption and healing. Towards the end of the movie Rhoda is finally able to tell the truth. After that truth is known Rhoda and John are finally able to see them selves.<br /><br />The story is profound because it addresses the fragmented aspects of ourselves. We are whole and complete when we can see and accept these parts of ourselves. Another Earth is a symbol for that other self that has become fragmented, unseen and unwanted. Accepting the \\"Another Earth\\" is the healing process not only for Rhoda, but for John Burroughs. The movie has strong esoteric underlying theme of healing ourselves on Earth. That healing would result in \\"Another Earth\\".
0767836324|1.0|Ok! This movie was one of the worst movies I have seen in my life! It had a horrible plot that was just plain BORING, great actors that failed miserably, not fun to watch, very little action, etc. etc. This is not a family film! Children between ages  3-10 will get incredibly bored and there is some bad language anyway, so you can just tag it as \\"not for little kids\\". I have no idea how this movie got Academy Awards?!?!?! I mean, it was soooo stupid, I stopped watching it about halfway through. At some parts, it did not even feel like a movie! Steven Spielberg may be a good director, but he failed miserably on this dumb sequel. This is just a piece of Hollywood junk. After I watched it, I went to bed thinking, \\"What the he11 did I just watch!?!\\". One guy commented, \\"My kids loved it!\\". Dude, are you joking?

0385534639|4.0|I will say that I haven't heard any of the hype around this book, but perhaps I'm just late to the scene. I will say that when I finished the book, I was so enthralled in this magical realm that I even dreamed about it. The author, with her beautiful writing and wonderful descriptions, transported me from my bed where I read the book and right into the midst of the circus. I could smell the smells, taste the caramel, see the bright fire. I never before wanted to be somewhere like that before.<br /><br />People complain about the characters and the lack of a plot on other reviews. As for the characters, I loved each of them! It was wonderful. I didn't need to know every single thought and action by the main characters. That added mystery and left room for my imagination to create up things. Marco and Cecila had me so in love with them that I would always grin a mile wide when they spoke to each other. It was a delicate, yet passionate love that was not put over the top. With the plot, didn't it make it more realistic? I love epic stories with epic characters and epic battles, but this story was never that to begin with, so why expect an epic competition between the two people in love? As this novel is so drenched with a magical sense, I believe the competition and how they handle it helps bring the story down to a more personal level.<br /><br />I did give the novel four stars because of two things. First, I felt that sometimes pointless characters were introduced, such as the Burgess sisters, and it weighed down the middle of the book a little. I would've been content to cut those sections out and not develop those characters at all since they mean so little.<br /><br />The other thing that nagged me were the way the chapters were labeled and the overall layout of the book. Perhaps it was because I was on the Kindle and not with the actual print, but the dates kept changing every chapter, making it very tedious to keep track of. Some of the dates would skip years and then come back some years just to go forward more years in the next chapter. I would constantly have to flip back the chapters before and check the dates to see how the chapter I was reading related in years.<br /><br />Overall, it was a beautiful book and had wonderful imagery. I hear they are making a movie of it, which makes me a little worried because I so loved my own images in my head. Regardless, I'm excited to see what becomes of it and how it lives up to such a wonderful text.

B004W2UBYW|4.0|That's why I gave the book 4 stars.  I think the man was brilliant.  He was a great visionary and a genius.  He was a pioneer in the personal computer industry and he did \\"make a dent in the universe.\\"  A BIG dent.<br /><br />People can say that he ripped off other peoples work such as MP3 players but SJ himself even admitted that \\"We didn't invent some of this stuff, we just found a way to make it better.\\"  His demand for quality and perfection was second to none.  I can relate.  I spent 30+ years of my life building.  I was a perfectionist.  I drove people crazy.  They hated me and loved me at the same time.  I feel that SJ had that same relationship with the people who worked for him.  I've been told by people who work for me \\"You are the biggest pain in the a$$ in the world.  I wouldn't want anybody else but you to build my house.\\"<br /><br />I have used PC's and other related tech since 1992.  I started using Apple products in 2008 and realized how much more superior their entire product line is over Dell, Gateway, Sony, and HP.  The Microsoft OS can't shine a Mac's shoes.  This was the result of a man who had a passion and was driven, much like myself.  I know the passion.  I know the drive. I know the journey to perfection.  Because of that passion I enjoy pretty much anything written about Steve Jobs.<br /><br />As fas as the book itself, it's a must read if you are at all fascinated by this great man.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was personally, I don't care how acclaimed this author is, I don't think the book itself was that well written.  Since I've become interested and fascinated with Apple products I have watched most of the Keynotes presented by SJ with great anticipation and enjoyment.  I find myself hanging on to every word he says (not necessarily believing all of it but believing that he feels whatever he was talking about was the best ever...in his eyes)  I have read much about him.  I have been very much into tech myself for close to 20 years now and have used extensively it in the building business.  I have incorporated much of today's technology into the houses I've built.  I the process I've learned how to build and network my own systems.  I've learned what products are good and what's poor.  I am one of those people that have to know how everything works.  There pretty much isn't anything built in this world that I can't figure out how it works or how to fix it if it's broken.<br /><br />Since the construction industry has died in this economy I have trained and obtained several certifications in Computer Technology.  With all of this knowledge and hands on experience I've come to understand the quality that Jobs has demanded into his products and how he obtained his goals through failures and success.  The beginning of the book starts out giving you insight to all of that but the finer details fizzle out as the book goes along.  That was disappointing to me.  I wanted to know all of that.  I kept waiting for some of that to appear but it never did.  The book ended sort of leaving me a little more educated but with a hollow feeling like there was more to learn about him but I did not know what that was.<br /><br />All in all, I still say the book is a must read.

B0073PPKNM|5.0|I absolutely love this CD! Melody Gardot's voice carries you to a warm and loving place. It has the feeling of a era past gone. Imagine a romantic island getaway from the 1940's. The CD I got is top quality, no flaws in the recording. You can hear some unique sounds in the background now and again, but it is obvious this was added for artistic purposes.
B006GHA9VQ|4.0|Years ago, when rumors surfaced that Andrew Lloyd Webber was working on a sequel to The Phantom of the Opera, I was both excited and appalled:  Excited because I'm a huge fan of the original show and would love to see and hear more material on the subject - and appalled because I couldn't imagine the possibility of a well-conceived idea for a sequel.  To move forward with a sequel - at least in my mind - there has to be more to the original story, and it has to be an intriguing story.  A good story.<br /><br />Whether you believe the story of Love Never Dies is a good one or not, I think it's at least. . . interesting.  The Phantom of the Opera was certainly interesting.  It's basically a \\"beauty and the beast\\" type of story told using spectacular scenery and lush, melodramatic music.  Andrew Lloyd Webber struck gold in more ways than one with that show.  Love Never Dies has the exact same formula except that there's a twist in the story, albeit a far-fetched one.  Just because some may perceive a story line to be implausible doesn't mean it's a bad idea.  I mean how likely is it that a horribly disfigured man came to be such a genius, such a musician, such an architect, such a magician?  Is it feasible that he'd live years and years across an underground lake underneath the Paris Opera House and haunt the place without ever being caught?  If you loved the original story, then I'm assuming you buy in to these ideas.  Why not?  After all, it's fiction.  Right?<br /><br />The continuing story that the Phantom escaped from Paris and discovers the fortune and anonymity he enjoys at Coney Island is completely plausible to me.  Same goes for the reason that lures Christine to New York 10 years later.  What has happened with Christine and Raoul's relationship in the interim isn't all that far-fetched either.  The twist in the story involving the only new primary character of Gustave is a bit hard to swallow but definitely not impossible.  If you understand that conceptiontook place just before the Phantom left Paris (and not sometime during the original story, which I find ludicrous that some reviews seem to think that that's when it occurred), then you have to know that the story line is possible.  I don't understand how some people can watch and listen to \\"Beneath a Moonless Sky\\" and not understand this.  I totally understand why a person might be skeptical about the likelihood of the circumstances, but again it's fiction.  Right?<br /><br />For the very reason that many people say the show doesn't work or for which the story is so often criticized, I believe the show wouldn't work without it.  The above-mentioned twist is what makes the story interesting.  I think it's the hook that makes the viewer want to see how the story is going to play out.  Add in the battle of the Phantom and Raoul vying to win Christine one last time, and the story becomes perhaps even more intriguing than the original story.  I'll admit I had trouble buying the whole story, but I found myself genuinely interested in seeing it all unfold, even if parts are completely predictable.  Realizing that the new story is pure fantasy, just like the original story, I enjoyed it a lot.<br /><br />I don't blame Andrew Lloyd Webber one bit for attempting what he's done here.  I absolutely don't believe that he has done what others have suggested - that he simply saw an opportunity to make some cash.  He attempted to strike gold again but not necessarily for fortune.  Rather, to be inspired to write new music for a subject that's near and dear to him.  Sure, he may have borrowed a melody or two he had previously written for something else to incorporate into the new score, but there is plenty of really terrific original stuff here.  Combine all of it with just the right amount of familiar tunes from The Phantom of the Opera, and the score to Love Never Dies is one of Webber's best ever.<br /><br />The production values are second to none.  From the actors on stage andthe musicians in the orchestra pit to the crew handling the sets, costumes and lighting, all are tremendous.  The picture and sound quality on the Blu-Ray are stellar.  I think Love Never Dies is a great show, and the disk is worth every penny to have as part of my collection.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5-star rating is because the show was filmed and put together on disk more like a movie than a live stage show.  I would have preferred to hear all of the audience reactions and to see all of the scene transitions.  You do hear some audience reactions, maybe only three or four times throughout the entire show.  When I see a show in person, I enjoy witnessing and imagining all of the technical and creative details that must go into changing from one scene to another and making everything flow seamlessly.  You get very little taste of that on the filmed version of this show.  It's obvious in many places that the producers cut out audience applause and footage during transitions from scene to scene.  Still, it's a beautifully shot and edited show.  The only reason I could fathom for the decision to produce the DVD in this way is that it made me, at least, want to see the show live (if it ever comes to the U.S.) more than I might have wanted to see it had the DVD given me more of a feeling of actually seeing it live.  If the show ever does tour the U.S. or perhaps go to Broadway, I will likely make every effort to see it.

B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Halestorm did an amazing job with this album. This is great old fashioned hard rock, a long with a few softer rock songs for mellower moments. Lizzy Hale has an amazing powerful voice that hasn't been heard in mainstream rock for years, and the rest of the band gives a very solid performance. The best songs are probably the faster harder ones such as Mrs. Hyde, and Love Bites. If you want something you can headbang too that isn't an all out assault on your eardrums, this album will work for you.

This e-book opened my eyes. Mr. Gaughran taught me alot about how and where to distribute my work once it is complete. If he reads this review, I'd say, \\"Thank you for witing this book.\\"
B005LAIGSM|2.0|I saw the movie before I read the book and thought the movie was okay. Your typical romance movie where love prevails all.<br /><br />Then I read the book. The book is so much better! Much Much better and I'm appalled at the changes that the producers and directors made. The only thing that the book and movie have in common are that a man and women were in love. They got in a car accident and the woman loses her memory of her husband. Which is a good story! I just wish they wouldn't have \\"connected\\" it with the book. Then it wouldn't be so annoying.<br /><br />If you want to see the movie rent it. Don't buy it. Or just never read the book.

B0058YPGL6|5.0|My mom says this is based on a movie from when she was young with the same name [[ASIN:B004742Y40 Teen Wolf]] which I watched with her, too. That movie was pretty cool but I like this show better because it keeps going and doesn't stop like a movie does. Plus the guy who plays the teen wolf is really really cute!!!!<br /><br />It's not really scary for me when he turns into a wolf but it kind of scared my little sister. I like the mystery part of the story and how Scott the guy who turns into a wolf has to deal with suddenly being a werewolf because he got bit by one. It makes it real hard for him to go on a date that's for sure!

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is probably one of the most \\"amazing\\" novels I have read in a very long time and I read constantly.  I became the mother in the book, not because my son is like Jacob, but you just can't help becoming Laurie, feeling her emotions, living with the breath being sucked out of you each and every day.  I couldn't put the book down and when it came to the end, I wanted to call the writer up and ask him why he would ever end the book.  I wanted to go on and on and on.  Frankly, this novel will eat you up and spit you out  The story will stay with you a long time and you will find it difficult to put away the thoughts and emotions that gripped your insides.  It's a \\"now\\" story, a \\"today\\" story, a most \\"satisfying\\" story.  Thank you William Landay.

B0059XTUVI|1.0|This is another movie that I was anxiously waiting to get my hands on. I watched the DVD a couple of days ago and I have to say it was a complete let down.  Meryl Streep is a fine actress but the storyline was very disappointing. I'm sure someone will make a better movie of the Iron Lady in the future.
0066620996|4.0|My initial motive for purchasing this book was because I needed it for a book report assignment that was a requirement for a quality control class. If it wasn't for that assignment I don't think I would have never picked up the book it's not my normal reading material. Fortunately the read was not as painful as I thought In fact it was a very practical read, almost like a detailed out line. I think one of the main reasons why I ended up enjoying the book was because Collins takes a straight forward approach on explaining why some companies are greater than other. He just compares similar competitor companies that have not reached the same level of success. Don't get me wrong some examples are hard to get through because he throws out a company performance figures and percentages but other than that it's a great read for people like me that like a response or a reason for every point the author makes. Another reason I think this book is a good read is because the interviews and situations he describes in these companies he researches are extremely relatable to anyone who has ever a job or worked in a group. It's an easy read with no filler. After reading this book you will find yourself applying the concepts you learned in any situation where you want to succeed in business and in life.

B001NLCBJI|5.0|***POSSIBLE SPOILERS!***<br /><br />Most everyone who watches this film can relate to either of the main characters.  It doesn't matter if you are in your 20s trying to figure everything out, or if you are middle-aged trying to understand where your life went and if there is anything left in the future.<br /><br />  Lost in Translation is about two people with a 30-year age gap, who find that essentially their life situations are not so different.<br /><br />  Scarlett  Johanssen is Charlotte.  She is in Japan with her husband who is a photographer.  He is in Japan on assignment to cover a band.  She tags along because she didn't figure there was anything else for her to do.  She spends much of her time staring out of the window of her hotel room wondering if there is anything else to her life.  Where is her life going?  How can she get out of the rut she feels she is in?<br /><br />  Bill Murray, (who turns in the best performance of his career and who has already stated that \\"Lost in Translation\\" is his favorite film of his body of work) is Bob Harris, a famous American actor who is in Japan to shoot a commercial to promote Suntori Whiskey.  He doesn't want to be there.  He is a man going through the motions, and for all of his professional success, wonders why he doesn't seem especially happy and if it is too late to start any kind of a new life.<br /><br /> In many ways, these two characters compliment each other and provide for each other with the necessary vision to realize that they can make changes to their lives and perhaps realize that there is still something good and wonderful to live for.  Bob helps Charlotte to see the possibilities ahead of her, while Charlotte helps Bob to appreciate the life he has, even though he now knows that he needs a new focus.<br /><br /> Bob sees the road he has already travelled while Charlotte only sees a road of unknowns.  She explains that she feels stuck.  She has tried her hand at different things without any kind of real fulfillment.  She has tried writing and photography without any kind of feeling of accomplishment.  Bob explains that he isn't worried about her at all because she is young and she will figure it out (which is probably similar to what he did at her age).  Bob, on the other hand, seems to feel almost cut-off from everyone.  Part of this is self-imposed as he seems to constantly be dodging fans who interrupt him while he is trying to enjoy a quiet moment at the hotel bar.  However, he talks to his wife who sounds more than just annoyed with him on the phone.  She sends him faxes at 4:00am about carpet samples.  One has to wonder if she really feels she needs his input, or if it is simply a way for her to have some kind of a conversation with him, even if it is about something as mundane as what color of carpet should be picked for his study.  He finally confesses to his wife on the phone, \\"I'm lost.\\"<br /><br />  There is something to be said for two \\"lost\\" souls who find each other in Tokyo, Japan.  Neither one, it seems, is particularly happy to be in Japan.  Neither one is able to sleep, and so they meet at the hotel bar.  There must be something there, as Bob sends a small smile across the room to Charlotte after she buys him a drink.  Somehow, Bob realizes that this is not another admiring fan.  He sees something genuine in Charlotte.  Before long, the two begin to spend some time together.<br /><br />  The time they spend together is only the foundation.  Soon, they begin to have conversations, each sharing about where they are in life and why they don't seem to be particularly happy.  Charlotte begins to see possibilities in Bob, and Bob begins to see new vision of life (one he's forgotten) in Charlotte.  The irony of the relationship is in the friendship and how each is able to provide some level of healing to the other.  However, given Bob's age and life experience, it is clear that he is the leader of the relationship.  Charlotte is worried about her life, but Bob tells her, \\"The more you know yourself and what you want, the less you let things upset you.\\"  However, the irony of when Bob tells Charlotte this, he realizes that he needs to remember this himself.  Another example is when Charlotte finds out that Bob has spent the night with a woman.  It's obvious she is upset and a tad jealous.  Bob wisely retorts, \\"Wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?\\"  Charlotte doesn't take the statement well, at first, until she realizes on some level that this is exactly what she wants: attention; someone to let her know that they care about her.  Her husband tells her that he loves her, but then he's out the door.  She wants someone to be with her.  And it is this element that now seems to be missing in her marriage.<br /><br />  Charlotte's husband, John, tries to be there for her, but he is so caught up in his work, that it is obvious that Charlotte has become secondary for him even though it is clear that he loves her.  Charlotte feels she is little more than another piece of luggage simply brought along for the trip.  She even states, \\"I don't know who I married.\\"<br /><br />  After a few days together, Bob tells her that he doesn't want to leave, when just a few days prior, he would have given anything to get out of Japan.  Charlotte has become a window to the possibility of a new life.  And for Charlotte, Bob is a light to a path that was once dark.  This is how each serves the other.  It is obvious that the two love each other.  It isn't so much of a romantic love as it is a genuine, loving friendship, and when it is time for them to part, as much as it hurts, brings the realization that it is time for each to go their own way.<br /><br />  Sofia Coppola masterfully navigates the story without it becoming two mired down in melodrama.  She keeps things simple and real, which is probably why so many viewers find themselves relating to the characters and the story.  It could be anyone, and this is why it works so well.<br /><br />  People don't often realize that strange surroundings and a stranger can be just the necessary ingredients for change and redirection and a refocus of one's life.  These types of ingredients can create a kind of bubble, which it does for Charlotte and Bob.  While they do interact with other people, it is about them in a small world created by each of them.  An environment which seems to foreign can be exactly what one needs to reach out to someone.  I don't think Charlotte would have met Bob if they had been in America.  Why would they?  In Japan, the environment allows each of them to stand out just enough to get the attention of the other.<br /><br />  Lost in Translation is one of my favorite films of the last decade, and the magic is in the story of two realistic characters who are trying to figure out their lives.  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen play their roles perfectly, as if each truly knows and understands their characters.  Ironically, this is what most people are trying to do every, single day of their lives.e, but Bob tells her, \\"The more you know yourself and what you want, the less you let things upset you.\\"  However, the irony of when Bob tells Charlotte this, he realizes that he needs to remember this himself.

0345803507|5.0|I tried and tried to re-frame from reading this series. On a lonely duty night ( Marine Husband ) I caved. I enjoyed the wittiness and perv appeal to it right away. I read all these books in two nights as soon as the kids were in bed. I annoyed fast though with the low level of Dom vibes coming from Christian. Yes, I know he didn't 'need' it anymore with her but dude really? You DON'T just lose the vibe right away. It showed up a few time's I guess but nothing like I thought it would. I found it to really be a Sex Crazed Disney Fairytale.  I will now forever dream to be her lol. I did enjoy it though! Bravo!<br /><br />Also liked that the Author didn't use freaking models on the covers. So 5 Stars just for that.

B000000XB9|5.0|There probably really isn't very much if anything I can say for Creedence or for this collection that hasn't been said at least a million times already, but I couldn't resist writing my own review here. Like many other people have said, Creedence put out some of the best rock 'n' roll ever (their \\"bluesy\\" and \\"countrified\\" stuff wasn't bad either!). While certain ones of their recordings were better than others (as is the case with any artist), the majority of them were great or really good. Of all of their (studio) recordings, they only put out one single track that I would consider a genuine \\"clunker\\" (that weird \\"Rude Awakening #2\\" track from the Pendulum album)! Hey, these guys were a band who could truly PLAY their instruments (by that, I mean play their instruments really well)! That's still a pretty rare thing, at least in my opinion! And, they played EVERYTHING THEMSELVES! That's right --- you won't find a single extra or \\"session\\" musician on a single one of their recordings! That's something you can't say about many artists of any era --- not even the Beatles! In fact, I must admit that, as much of a Beatle lover as I am, I think Creedence were better musicians! (Not that I think the Fab Four were bad ones --- far from it! They're still my very favorite artists --- not even Creedence could completely top them, in my opinion!) Also, John Fogerty's vocals were nothing short of incredible --- they were great even when he was shouting! Unlike so many other vocalists, whose shouting just sounds like, well... shouting, Fogerty had good \\"control\\" over his shouting; he could both shout AND carry a good melody at the same time! As for the Chronicle compilation, ALL of Creedence's VERY best tracks are presented. \\"Proud Mary,\\" \\"Bad Moon Rising,\\" \\"Fortunate Son,\\" \\"Travelin' Band,\\" \\"Up Around The Bend,\\" \\"Hey Tonight\\"... and of course, many others! There are only a couple of tracks here that I wouldn't say are among the VERY best, and even they aren't bad! Most of thesetracks were released on singles (thus, Chronicle is in essence primarily a singles collection), but also included is the band's 11-minute treatment of \\"I Heard It Through The Grapevine.\\" (\\"Susie Q\\" is just \\"Part 1\\" of the single, but that's O.K. with me.) Although I normally kind of frown on really long, drawn-out stuff, I actually find Creedence's really long tracks to be very enjoyable (except for \\"Rude Awakening #2\\"), and I think \\"Grapevine,\\" which is the longest one (except for the 13-minute live version of \\"Keep On Chooglin'\\" that appeared on Live In Europe), is the best! The CD closes with the band's last single A-side, \\"Someday Never Comes,\\" which is my least favorite track on the CD and one of my least favorite Creedence recordings (although I don't really think it's bad), but that's not enough to keep me from giving the comp five stars. (Incidentally, the comp includes most of the group's single B-sides that came out before Tom Fogerty left the band [except for \\"Susie Q, Part 2,\\" \\"Walk On The Water,\\" and \\"Born On The Bayou,\\" which appear on Chronicle Vol. 2], but it doesn't include the B-sides of the last two singles, and those songs don't appear on Vol. 2, either; I don't really know why they're not on either volume, unless it's because they don't feature lead vocals by John.) Creedence were the greatest American rock 'n' roll (and blues and country) band, and if what you want is their very best stuff on a single CD, look no further than Chronicle. In fact, EVERYONE'S rock 'n' roll collection should have at least this one Creedence CD in it, in my opinion!
0345803485|3.0|I have read the three books and of all of them \\"Fifty Shades of Freed\\" was the best of the three. I did enjoy the relationship between the two characters. It is \\"real\\" in the sense that they do struggle to understand and define the roles in their relationship which I think is common in actual life and likeable for woman to read. I enjoyed watching them develope into something beautiful together. The love story is a good read once you get past the extremely repetitive sex scenes and repetetive writing. Several times throughout all three books the same lines were quoted over and over. The writing is juvenial; basically I thought it was written at a \\"Twilight\\" reading level, this is DEFINETLY an adult book that could have been written so much better.
B005D646RE|5.0|Seriously, the best show currently on television is Breaking Bad. The atmosphere created by each scene in the show is haunting and carefully crafted. The writing is clever and always keeps you on your toes. The acting is awesome, the camera work is beautiful. Just incredible!

0345803485|5.0|I would like to know what other people were reading and if they read this with their eyes closed? I mean I get that these books aren't for everyone but you knew what you were getting yourself into when you bought these books. I for one loved them and sad that I have read through them rather quickly. I passed them onto my mother in-law and she loved them. Cursed me out the first night because she was up until 230 in the morning reading the first book. Everyone I have talked to that have read these love these books. If it was written so poorly or written by a teenager as many have claimed then why did you bother reading the entire series? Should of stopped at the first one if it was just oh so bad. Yes there are many phrases repeated through out the books but that didn't bother me one bit. I think people are just a bit picky. I have read over 5,000 books and this series is by far the best I have read in such a long time. I can only hope that the author writes more books.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|This was a great season to watch. Really wish they wouldn't have cancelled the show. Seems they always get rid of the good ones for more \\"reality\\" shows..... who do we petition to bring back Veronica Mars??
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Oh the beautiful, smart people all in one place. A particularly snide character is placed in the shows to offset the beauties. Show starts out slow then shazam! the show is cleverly written!
B000NA2BEU|5.0|This was a great season to watch.  Really wish they wouldn't have cancelled the show.  Seems they always get rid of the good ones for more \\"reality\\" shows.....  who do we petition to bring back Veronica Mars??
B007QSNMS6|5.0|I just finished reading \\"Velocity\\" by Ahmed/Olander. Amid the clutter and noise of today, this one really stands out.<br /><br />It's such an inspiring, compelling, relevant narrative for anyone living / working in the digital age of today (aren't we all?). I loved the approach the authors took; it's like a stream of considered consciousness structured in a simple format. The back & forth dialogue, with the conversational tone, provides a unique insight into the minds of two of the industry's definitive thought leaders.<br /><br />The \\"Seven Laws\\", structured as chapters, are sure to become part of the new vernacular, with the closing summaries being something I'll be referring back to quite frequently.<br /><br />I buy/read dozens of books from Amazon every quarter...it's rare for me to finish the entire piece, let alone take the time to write a review. Bottom line: I'm re-reading this one!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|its a great game. don't get me wrong. but its a little too sensitive and it lags worse. rakes longer to gain points as well... definatly better on the ipad iphone or ipod  but I guess it's alright on the kindle fire.. needs the mag fixed asap
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a good app, I was very excited to see it in the app store. I got the cave run app and it doesn't compare to temple runner. Great app, it is really fun. I don't know how they expect you to get 25,000 coins though.
B007MJ9LA2|3.0|I love Carlos Santana and what he and his bands have done for modern music. Whenever I get one of his albums there are 2 or 3 songs that just seem to grab my soul. This album, while well played, is not recognizable by me as a Carlos Santana style production. If I played it for some of my friends they would say it was soft dinner background music.<br /><br />No real strong Latin beat more like background music and sound tracks for a movie. Could be good nightclub or restaurant music but this is not why I listen to Carlos Santana. This is a lot of soft guitar and band music with only one song having any vocals in it. To me it was like the band was just soft jamming together for their own enjoyment.<br /><br />While the music was good it is not the kind of music that made me a Santana fan. Bring on the HEAT and FIRE that we all love. It seems like the passion is gone. Not once did I feel like cranking up the volume or had a smile on my face.<br /><br />OK album and I enjoyed it but far from Santana's best!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is awesome get it! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  !  !  !  !  !  !

1401235417|4.0|When DC Comics announced they were re-booting all their titles, they were met with skepticism from millions of superhero fans. How could they seemingly brush aside 70 to 80 years of history and just restart everything from issue #1? It was easy for them. They just moved forward with writers and artists and did it. It worked as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />\\"Batman Volume 1: The Court of Owls\\" is an excellent collection of the first six issues of the renumbered title. Everything about this book reflects high quality. The story is intricate and the art compliments it in a twisted beautiful manner. If you never gave the reboot of the \\"Batman\\" series a chance, do yourself a favor and pick it up now. It comes in a special edition hardcover form and includes bonus material like character sketches, alternate covers, and more.
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally got it for kindle fire. I know how fun this game is and you should,  no need to get this game!!!!!
B004LWZW9M|3.0|Garry Marshall follows up his last holiday film \\"Valentine's Day \\" with \\"New Year's Eve.\\" It's not an actual sequel like most people thought when it was first announced. You could call it more of a companion piece. They have the same general structure but with different characters.<br /><br />If you haven't seen \\"New Year's Eve\\" yet, don't expect too much. It's a nice little movie to watch with your significant other for a date night. If you've already seen it and want to own it for your home entertainment collection, the \\"New Year's Eve\\" Blu-ray will satisfy consumers with a good high definition transfer of the film and plenty of extra features.
B0086700CM|5.0|rocks I'm happy this is finnally on kindle love it great game for when you are bored best app ever
B005LAIIS0|4.0|Director Joe Carnahan went from directing the big-screen adaptation of \\"The A-Team\\" right back to smaller projects like his earlier \\"Smokin' Aces\\" films and \\"Narc.\\" One thing he brought with him to his first movie after his brush with blockbuster territory was an actor who guarantees moviegoers and critics will pay attention to him - Liam Neeson.<br /><br />\\"The Grey\\" delivers from the standpoint of a film. You get characters developed enough to care about and some surprises here and there. Carnahan's story and direction get's the viewer emotionally invested. This isn't for the faint of heart. There's a lot of blood and intense scenes of violence coupled with quite a bit of foul language. If you like stories of survival then this movie is for you. Just don't expect too many special features to sweeten the Blu-ray purchase.
B0086700CM|4.0|It needs to be able to do more things.  cccccff f c f fccccfcc c.  f ff ff ff d
1401234542|4.0|Fans of DC Comics' Green Lantern couldn't have expected what they received when the publishing giant relaunched the superhero's title as part of its New 52 initiative last year. Instead of a book that concentrated on the well-known incarnation of the character (Hal Jordan), they chose to center the action around the redemption of his biggest foe, Sinestro. Jordan figures into the story heavily, but it's his arch nemesis's motivations and conduct moving the storyline of \\"Green Lantern Volume 1: Sinestro\\" forward.<br /><br />Fans of Green Lantern who were afraid they would totally recreate the character and make his past adventures obsolete need not worry. This is just an extension of what enthusiasts love about the character already, but gives new people a chance to jump in as well.  \\"Green Lantern Volume 1: Sinestro\\" is great storytelling coupled with intricate and striking art. It's recommended reading for dedicated devotees of the character's adventures as well as newcomers.
B003QSMCKO|4.0|This was a good movie worth seeing.  I gave it only 4 stars though because there was so much implied violence, but that was difficult to avoid given the plot.  Though there was a lot of implied violence, but my 4-year old didn't know what was happening.  Disney did its usual good job of implying any violence in a way that younger kids who don't already understand death and killing already, aren't left with questions due to the movie.  With Eddie Murphy doing the voice of a major character, it is good watch for adults too.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game has challenges and very fun aspects to it. I love being able to level up and buy bee things. It is a very fun and interesting game.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|The Lumineers are a folksy trio who stick to their roots.  Accompaniment is minimalist: guitar, cello, mandolin, percussion (stomps, claps, tambourine, drums).  The lead vocalist's voice is more down-home than polished or pretty, but it fits the music perfectly.  He sings with conviction and emotion.  The backing vocals range from light harmonies to rowdy shouts.  Passion infuses their songs, whether the catchy \\"Ho Hey\\" or the heart-wrenching but electrifying \\"Morning Song.\\"  They have a gift for crafting instantly engaging melodies, but they do enough with them so that they don't get stale after repeated listens.  As simple as the music is, it resonates emotionally so that it continues to captivate and inspire.  Each listen is rewarding and emotionally fulfilling.<br /><br />My first inclination is to compare them with the Avett Brothers (particularly \\"I and Love and You\\") and Mumford and Sons.  But I realize both of these comparisons are lacking.  There's no banjo here.  The overall sound is simpler.  But this isn't a deficiency.  It suits their songs beautifully.  This self-titled recording is near perfect.<br /><br />The first track, \\"Flowers in Your Hair\\", feels incomplete because it's so short and ends abruptly.  The second track, \\"Classy Girls\\", takes a while to get going, but it evolves into a foot-stomping good time.  \\"Submarines\\" is the first complete and instantly captivating song.  But the hits just keep coming thereafter.  There really isn't a dud on the album.<br /><br />As of now, Amazon has each of the album's songs available to stream in full.  Take the opportunity to sample the album in its entirety.  There's a good chance you won't regret it. If this style of music appeals to you, you can't go wrong.  Excellent album!
B003L77TZI|5.0|At first glance I had thought Amazon had given me a brand new album, instead of the used one that I ordered. Its in great condition! I ordered the free two-day shipping that comes with Amazon Prime, and I ended up getting free overnight shipping! Way to go Amazon! Thanks! Onto the album:<br />This album is something I have mixed feelings about. I had been familiar with some of the hit tracks on the album before purchasing this, so by now I'm already annoyed with said songs. However, some of the songs I hadn't heard are brilliant!<br /><br />Ratings:<br />-Teenage Dream: is the theme of the album. It's your typical pop song, gets annoying after a while. 3.5/5<br />-Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F): is another typical pop song, very catchy, also gets annoying after a while. 4/5<br />-California Gurls: I remember this coming out and all the hype surrounding it. Not one of the most meaningful tracks on the album, but its not bad either. 3.5/5<br />-Firework: is one of the most memorable tracks on the album. Its evident Katy put a lot of time and effort behind this track. Very inspiring and uplifting. One of the best songs on the album, by far. 5/5<br />-Peacock: is a fun track about wanting to see a guy's \\"peacock.\\" Its memorable, but for the wrong reasons. Compared to Firework, it's not very good. Very catchy, however. 3.5/5<br />-Circle the Drain: is one of the better tracks on the album. May take a few listens to get used to. 5/5<br />-The One That Got Away: is a song that everyone can relate to. One of my favorites for sure. 5/5<br />-E.T.: one of the better typical pop songs, catchy too. 4/5<br />-Who Am I Living For: is definitely in the same category as Firework, Circle the Drain and The One That Got Away. It isn't one of the most popular tracks on the album, but its one of the best. 5/5<br />-Pearl: is another track that belongs in the group listed above. Not one of the most popular, but one of the best. 5/5<br />-Hummingbird Heartbeat: is still a typical pop song, but its better than Teenage Dream, Last Friday Night and Peacock. Very catchy too. 4/5<br />-Not Like The Movies: is another a slower song. I like it. Not one of the most popular, but it's good. 4/5<br /><br />Ratings Overall:<br />3.5 = 3 Songs<br />4 = 3 Songs<br />5 = 6 Songs<br /><br />So if you take the album for 6 really good songs, its a great album. If you're willing to have a little fun and let loose with the pop songs, you'll enjoy it even more. I find it to be a great album and would recommend if you're considering it.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 8/10
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Excellent book. Good audio book. I finished the book in about four running sessions. Very nice for seasoned married couples in need of support.
B0086700CM|5.0|I bought this game fully expecting to play it once and then decide it wasn't for me. I like games like Frontierville. I don't care for running and jumping games. I was so wrong. This game is fun and easy yet challenging at the same time. The only negative thing I could say is that you need to be prepared to have this game take over hours of your life. lol. I can't stop playing it. lol.
0345803507|5.0|Just like the two before it....couldnt put it down. And the closer I got to the end the more disappointed I became because I didnt want it to end! I hope the author gives us more of Ana and her loving Mr. Fifty Shades!
B0086700CM|5.0|So happy I can get this on my Kindle now! This is the most addicting game ever. There's not really any need to use real money, you'll be playing so much you'll rack up coins pretty fast! The one thing I think would be cool is if the different unlockable characters had different abilities, but besides that this game is perfect.
0345803493|5.0|I couldnt put this one down. Found myself grabbing at it every available minute to find out what was coming next....no pun intended. Oh Mr and Mrs Fifty, how you intrigue the inner fantasies.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Thought provoking and lots of twists and turns.  Was sorry when it was over. I think the ending struck a good chord.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very relaxing and challenging at the same time. Worth every penny. All levels are doable. I was able to achieve &quot;perfect&quot; without looking at hints.<br />When finished the game I was so happy that I immediately bought the sequel.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love the graphics. they are sooooooo amazing. the fruit.in the game is so beautiful. get the app now. if you dont then you'll be sorry. trust me I prefer temple run over fruit ninjas. its your choice! make wise decisions!<br />that it it for THIS review.
0345803485|1.0|This is so poorly written. The only books I've ever read that were worse were free kindle books! I should have gotten the kindle sample for free, and saved myself $9.99.  Considering all the fuss I've heard about this book, I had high expectations and am very disappointed.<br /><br />I really don't understand why any company published it! I don't pretend to possess great writing skills myself, but I have been a voracious reader for over 40 years, and I know when something's wrong when I read it.<br /><br />Bad sentence structure. Just odd way of putting words together that constantly break my attention. I find I'm spending half of my \\"reading\\" time trying to figure out what's wrong with the sentence I'm reading.<br /><br />I think I will re-read Anne Rice's Beauty & the Beast trilogy instead.
B0086700CM|5.0|This one gets 5 stars easely-good job even with the graphics and no lagging when playing. It is even worth paying for. GOOD job!!!
B007AMMHSY|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen this year.  Elena Anaya nailed it again.  They should bring her to the United States and make good movies for her.  I strongly recommend this movie to anyone that likes thrillers and twisted movies.
B0086700CM|5.0|All of my friends have had this game on their apple devices and I am so glad it finally came on amazon! This game is so fun! I seriously can't stop playing it!
B004EI2NM2|5.0|very explicit, but very romantic.... strongly recommend this movie.  Elena Anaya is one of my favorite actresses and now so is Natasha Yarovenko.  It must have taken a lot of courage to do this movie nude all the time.
0307341550|2.0|If I had to describe \\"Sharp Objects\\" in two words, I'd call it Southern Gothic.  This book is diverting and skillfully written, especially for a first novel.  But afterward I was sorry I spent my time on it.  The author works too hard to create a world that is entirely nasty and dark.  (To some people \\"nasty and dark\\" is a compliment.  Not me, though.) Her newest book is getting great reviews, but I'll be less likely to buy it after reading this one.
B0086700CM|4.0|A maz ing!!!! it's soooo addicting. U like can't take your eyes of the screen. And it's so much bigger than on an iphone or itouch. But it's not as big as an ipad. It would be sooooo much better if the sound wasn't delayed.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fabulous and fun every time!  great milestones and graphics.  it does buffer sometimes causing a misstep, but otherwise great.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I've been addicted to this game since I got it about a well ago. If you like logic games, you will love this game. Great job!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|omg i love this book my fav character is rue!!!! shes so cute but sad when she gos it sucks but thats the way it works... !!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|It's so fun how you can purchase new items and upgrades... I just wish you can change the way the character looks like... other than that, it's very addictive!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app on a daily basis to check temp, wind and the forecast for the day/week.  it's quick and easy.  when we travel (even overseas) I simply input my new location and I'm all set.  works great on my kindle fire.
B00002SWEM|5.0|I bought this product because my father loved it and I wanted him to have it as we had seen it on TV he wanted to have his own it's amazing to have it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best action pack game in the world I love it so much it also is so addictingt
B00356CO1E|1.0|I wanted to post this review to make others aware that these exercises have lots of squats and jumping.  I have just been diagnosed with a patella/knee inflammation in both knees from these exercises in this DVD.  Please be careful - I am now in physical therapy for a month to undo the damage from improperly squatting (although I followed Jillian's advice on how to squat according to her instruction).  Workouts 2 and 3 are way too intense with stress on your body.  I agree with the other reviewers that there is not enough stretching.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great book to start the pool season with.<br />A fresh twist with a teen sidekick helps give this novel a unique perspective.  If you love this genre, it's a delicious treat!  Just remember the sunscreen if you become too deep into the book and loose track of time.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|There's been descriptions that this was nothing more than a violence-filled porno. Pornoes don't have an emotional capacity that this show has throughout its entirety. Why do I say that? I'm taking the word of Erin Cummings from the special features (after I watched the show, of course). And she was great as Spartacus' wife, let alone as a human being at all in this world where man ruled and woman ACTED like they listened yet had conspiratorial tongues behind closed doors.<br />People think that Ancient Rome was at its wildest during the reign of Caligula. Really, while that is true, it was just a rampant romp throughout its time, and this show held nothing back. People getting it on in the tight confines of the street while others went about their business(es) and Batiatus tried making deal after corrupt deal with his fellow corrupters, as well as in the extravagant stadium that was new. Filled with tons of sand (and gallons upon gallons of spilt blood), this was no PG-rated life, though I'm not entirely certain people swore as much as Batiatus. Yet I have no doubt there were people with as much emotion and nobility as the unnamed Spartacus (not his name, but a Roman nickname for him due to how he reminded the masses of a legendary character).<br />He got captured while his wife forcefully taken away. Now he just wants her back, no matter the cost. I didn't expect the price to be heavy, let alone what it would all produce when secrets flowed out, betrayals revealed (some at their fruition), and slaves being made to do unjustifiable and depraved acts while being the \\"entertainment\\" for others to gloat about.<br />Story-wise, it does get a touch slow at first (somewhat balanced by overdone CGI that's completely reminescent of 300, then it's only visually reminescent, not story-wise), but it gets stronger with each episode (so does the swearing and blood).<br />When it's all said and done (and gutted), you could end up wanting to cheer Spartacus on (along with his co-horts). Now to wait-extremely impatiently-for Vengeance.horts). Now to wait-extremely impatiently-for Vengeance.
B000JSI7BM|5.0|The devil wears prada, was amazing film. Also the this fil contain deleted scenes what its so much wonderfull expierence. I love this film a lot!! it's the best in its kind
B004HW7JMO|3.0|Quick explanation:<br />85% excessive (and normally useless) hardcore sex (lads and lasses alike, mix/match as well) and hardERcore violence.<br />15% story.<br />That's to say the backstory behind certain things that are simply hinted at in Blood and Sand, and there were plenty of things that were hinted. Yet the show felt off-kilter, ratio-wise about revelations and whatnot.<br />I know, I know... this was being done while Andy Whitfield (R.I.P., dude!) was recovering, so, why not get a little extra thrown in so you know better the characters you love and those you hate?<br />There are those moments that seem to take your breath away (like Batiatus' dad making a confession that seemed off rom how he normally was) and foot-stomping moments (just not on people's faces like in the show).<br />Though the excessive violence and sex weren't the only reason for the low rating, there instances where the grammar wasn't right. This show's English is set in an ancient Latin-based style, so why they threw out a couple direct \\"yes\\"s are beyond me. Throws off the historically accuracy. That's why it alwasy sounds archaic, beat-around-the-bush when they're giving affirmatives (nowadays, a simple \\"yes\\" can be used for ambiguity, unlike then).<br />I still find it sad yet at the same time just how Animaeus ended up losing her life, but seeing the one woman you felt most hurt for gets it brutally, for that, I couldn't help but shed a tear or two.<br />Aside from all that, I do hope to see Gannicus in Vengeance. If he can kill while blindfolded, how would he go against Spartacus?
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run for my ipod and now I have it for my kindle fire!! somebody pinch me! its the best game ever and it should be the most played one forget angry birds.
B005LAIGNC|5.0|In my fantasy-centered mind, I think of the Tuskegee Airmen as hobbits- they're more background props who have a hand in history yet next to no attention for what they did.<br />Good thing for this movie or I would never have heard of them. Last WW2 movie I saw that had dealt with racism was Miracle at St. Anna and it felt too much. This I could handle. Don't ask why. Anyway, when I found out this was by the same company that did Star Wars, I was a bit weary (prequel trilogy wasn't that good, unlike the sequel trilogy, nentheless, it wasn't my cup of tea for sci-fi). Tried it out nonetheless.<br />Moments of hardcore laughter, moments of poignant sadness, great, gritty, realistic special effects, showing there's more to war than what most would think about, this film I very well enjoyed, even if I don't know the whole story behind this story.<br />Cuba Gooding, Jr. was great at his role (if not perfect) alongside Terrence Howard (he did better in this than he did in Iron Man by a far shot) and several actors I've never seen before. Many of them were flat-out great at what they did, others seemed a bit one-dimensional (don't some human beings?).<br />So, historically, who takes the most flak? I'd say those who get overlooked for no good reason, only ignorant reasons.<br />This was a great film to enjoy.
B004J4X73K|5.0|I have to confess, I ate this book up. I finished the whole thing in only about 2 days, sneaking peaks all day at work any chance I got. I know a lot of people were not as happy with Shadows Return, because of the focus primarily on the characters instead of some grand plot that set the whole nation in peril.<br /><br />Well fear not, because the you-know-what has hit the fan in Skala, and Seregil, Alec, & Thero have to sort out what is going on and why before the heir to the throne becomes the next victim of the \\"Sleeping Death\\" while protecting Princess Klia & Queen Phoria from rival cabals.<br /><br />The only bad thing I have to say is that when the culprit is unveiled, we don't learn too much about where he came from and how he can do what he can do, and I really want to know more about what he did, and if there is any way to free the ones considered hopelessly lost now (can't say more without giving spoilers).<br /><br />A LOT of people get killed off. So be prepared, poor Seregil & Alec!<br /><br />Anyway all in all a great book and a return to the original formula of the novels. Bravo!! Can't wait for the next one.
B0013F1D02|5.0|This is a really good movie. It's fantasy, not too kiddy-oriented and not too adult. I like the story, and I definitely will buy the and read the novel. Since this is the happily ever after type, I'd already guessed what's going to happen but I was hooked on to finishing the movie. It wasn't boring and the special effects were great!
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game. so much fun. i play it all the time! I use to not see what all the hype was about but now I'm a total addict!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Excellent, read it in 2-days and downloaded the whole 3-books on my iphone - now on the 3rd book. Wish there was more, hope to see a prequel to the Hunger Games in future or a carry on.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is on of the best apps on the kindle app store.  get the game ok ok great  hope you love the game i know you will
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great app!  Helps keep you very organized.  The multiple notebooks allows you to keep track of many things at once. I use it for writing novels and other projects.  If I think of an idea while I'm out, I put in my Evernote and it syncs with my phone, computer,  and Kindle Fire.
B0086700CM|5.0|all u do is get chased by scary monkey that scream at you well so far as I think no finding gold in caves no curses so for bit it really fun so if u rate 5 stars and Ps I can rite 900 books about this
1455502626|5.0|So far, I have read the John Corey books out of order.  I started with The Lion's Game followed immediately by The Lion so I wanted to go back to the book that introduced Corey's character; Plum Island.  What a Book !!!  I read it in three days because I had to take time for my life's activities but I really couldn't put it down.  I love the way Nelson DeMille develops his characters and believe that Corey gets more out spoken and sarcastic with each book.  DeMille so skillfully describes the area in which his story takes place that I feel as though I could go there and recognize it.  DeMille is an excellent writer and I am in the process of reading everything that he has written.  I saw that a new John Corey book will be released in October and have already added it to my wish list.  I highly recommend this action-packed page turner.
B007P6VM04|5.0|SMASH is a great TV series and this CD shows off the many talents of Kathryn McPhee and other singer/cast members.  This is a great CD to listen to over and over.
0345803485|2.0|I hopped on the band wagon!  Read all 3 in less than 2 weeks time!  Not an amazing feat at all.  Out of sheer boredom and tired of repetition!  The first book and the sex was HOT, but by the time I got to book 2, I was like REALLY?  ENOUGH!!! no one and i mean NOONE has that much sex at the drop of a hat. I get it's fantasy, it was fun but Jesus, the writer very easily could've whittled it down to a book and a half.  I really did not need 6 pages of Ana contemplating and describing washing Christians hair.  WTF??  Anyway, if you go into realizing its purely entertainment, then you'll be just fine.  Terrible writing too
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there are wide variety of games not just a different spin on the same things.there are also numerous ways to earn points and I like that.
B0086700CM|4.0|I am so happy that this became available for the kindle fire. I downloaded it just a few days after it became available and never had any problems, however I have been experiencing some serious lag time with the game since more people have been downloading it making it seriously hard to play at times
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|Good quality, price and fits very nicely backwards on the camera. Used it in Jamaica and it was very easy to snap it off and on the camera.

0439023513|3.0|I was expecting a killer conclusion, but I'm sorry to say that this trilogy didn't end on a bang for me.  Although there was a lot of action going on, the book felt very humdrum and by the end I didn't feel very attached to the characters, especially Katniss, who was apathetic through most of the book.  The ending seemed a bit slapdash, as though Collins had run out of steam and just wanted to wrap it up already.<br /><br />*spoilers*<br />Another thing that could have been better was Peeta's recovery after the Capitol tampered with his brain.  Collins could have allowed time for his relationship with Katniss to mend in a new way, but his recovery was very rushed.  There was no time for Peeta to remember, or at least to form new memories and love Katniss again on his own terms.  Because of this, their marriage at the end wasn't satisfying.<br /><br />As for Prim's death, I didn't really feel anything when she died.  There wasn't much time in the books for the reader to get to know and care about her, so when Katniss grieved for several pages, I was bored.<br /><br />I did, however, enjoy some parts of the book.  Katniss killing Coin in the end was fitting, and Gale's character development took an interesting turn.  The battle in the Capitol was weird and inventive and kept me reading.<br /><br />All in all, Mockingjay was so-so.  Katniss was numb for most of the book, so I was starving for some raw emotion in parts that felt cold, hollow, and distant.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. it makes the Bible easy to read and comprehend. I especially love that it reads to you!
0345803485|2.0|I heard about this series from a radio personality. She raved about it. I like the romance genre so I thought I'd give it a try. I read the reviews here on amazon and it seems to split mostly down the middle where the reader either loved it or hated it. I figured it would be a bit cheesy like Twilight but basically a good, easy read. I found myself hating the book in the second chapter. I decided to push on and finish it since I paid ten dollars for it.<br /><br />A few reasons why I hate it:<br /><br />1) Christian, the love interest, is creepy. I need to love the hero to like the book, but he is so weird I have a hard time getting past it. The author tries to make up for his weirdness through money, looks, and unbelievable talents. It doesn't work.<br /><br />2) I am not a feminist but spanking a woman as punishment pisses me off. I feel like the author sets women back a couple hundred years by making Anastasia get off on it even though she is humiliated by it. I can wrap my head around S&M spanking for pleasure but this was very one sided pleasure. It was hard to not just feel angry after reading it.<br /><br />3) I also have a hard time getting past the fact that Anastasia is basically a British woman in American skin. I feel like the author should write what she knows. Just base the stupid book in England if she wants the main character to reflect her native country. She uses British slang, loves classic British literature, drinks hot tea in place of coffee, and  desperately wants to visit England. I don't know anyone like this in Texas.<br /><br />4) Too much sex. I found myself getting bored with all the sex and I really just wanted the author to get on with the plot. Every two pages they are going at it like rabbits.<br /><br />5)I don't want to have to use a dictionary to read a romance/erotica novel. Most of the book is poorly  written and edited and then out of the blue the author interjects a word I have never even heard of.Really!? Why is that necessary?<br /><br />Now I will shamefully admit that I actually purchased the second book. The author piqued my interest in the last few chapters. She abruptly ends with a cliff hanger. I wrestled with myself over whether or not to purchase the next book and decided that I would. Looks like I will end up reading the trilogy to find out what happens to the characters. The main character is interesting and realistic enough for me to care about the plot so on I read. The \\"speed bumps\\"(when I put the book down) seem to happen at the numerous sex scenes.<br /><br />In conclusion, I seem to lean mostly to the hate side but, there is something about it that I don't understand that has me reading on. If you don't like the occasional trashy romance novel, don't read this book. I would only recommend this book if you can read it for free. Borrow it from a library or a friend but don't waste money on it.

B0015AARJI|5.0|The Dualshock 3 is a great controller, IF you buy the real one.  There is an epidemic of fake controllers floating around on Amazon.  My personal experience is that my last two purchases of this controller from third parties were both fakes -- and those third party sellers both have stellar customer ratings.  Some of the knockoffs are extremely hard to detect by appearance, so I'm sure many unassuming casual gamers are buying these and keeping them, none the wiser.  However, as a gamer needing precision for first-person-shooters, I can tell immediately if a controller is a fake because the precision on the analog sticks is terrible on the counterfeits.  There are some decent youtube videos on spotting fakes by appearance, but the latest fake I received was so close appearance-wise, I couldn't tell it apart from the real thing by just looking at it.  Don't settle for a cheap fake controller worth $15 when you are shelling out the big bucks for the real thing.<br /><br />The solution to this problem is to ONLY purchase controllers from Amazon.com LLC.  Buyer beware!

James<br />Genre: Fiction; Historical Mystery<br />Ages: Adult<br />Published December 6, 2011 by Knopf<br /><br />Mr. Wickham has been charged with murder. I have to admit that I am a sucker for anything that purports to be a Pride and Prejudice continuation. I really thought this would be a great one, considering the author, but I was so disappointed and BORED. While the new book needs to be written in the same spirit and style of the original, it does need to have something to pull it through to the end. This didn't.

0345803485|5.0|I don't review books / items but after the harsh critics buffet line of negative feed back, I wanted to weigh in.  This book was written first on fan fiction and was so popular it got published. Cut the author some slack.  I actually enjoyed the easy read and overlooked some of the writing flaws in spite of this gripping tale.  While I think that this story connects with certain people (ones less judgementle) it doesn't for others.  I can accept that .There are so many reading styles and while I respect the opinions of others, I am grateful for James story.  I don't read romance books but this was an exception.  I adored this book and the journey it took me on.  Yes, I like sophisticated writing too, but this was a quick and mindless read and I rather enjoyed that.  Some authors can write with sensory overload, writing 3 pages in depth to describe the way a room looks.  I recommend this book to all women who aren't criticle and looking to chew it apart and just want to lose yourself in a brilliant story :) I look forward to more writings from James.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is fun, my only complaint is the simplicity of the games. But I guess that's what you get when you put 124 games into one. The good thing is, if you don't like one of the games you're bound to find or soon unlock one that you do like.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|This last book by John Grisham is breathtaking and reflects the current problems of \\"lost\\" teens. It is well written as always so that the reader feels part of the plot: surroundings, characters, personalities, etc.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Grisham<br /><br />Catherine Jourdan
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The year is 1963, and Skeeter has returned from college to find life as usual among her privileged set.  She's the only one in the Junior League who notices that the black servants must silently endure insults and degradation at the hands of their oblivious employers.  She decides to write a book about how the help really feel about their jobs and asks to interview several maids.  This is socially risky for Skeeter and seriously dangerous for the maids.<br /><br />I loved the book and was glad that the movie is just as good.  The cruelty heaped on the help by their snooty bosses is heart-breakingly portrayed.  Bryce Dallas Howard was surprisingly good as the nasty queen bee of the Junior League and Emma Stone is refreshing and likable as the brave Skeeter.  Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer play Aibileen and Minny, two long-time maids who risk everything to contribute to Skeeter's book.  They both give outstanding performances.<br /><br />Life in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1963, is recreated in fine detail and the script is witty and honest.  Highly recommended.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Downloaded this because I finished book 5 of ASOIAF and needed something new, and I've seen several articles on how well this book did. I've only been reading for about half an hour but thus far, I'm getting the impression that the author read \\"Twilight\\" and decided that it would be cool to write the same story, only with 20-somethings instead of angsty teens and millionaires instead of vampires. I suppose if you loved Twilight, you'll be crazy about 50 Shades of Grey, as it appears to be \\"Twilight for Grownups\\".<br /><br />1. We have a clumsy, shy, pale brunette who is apparently gorgeous but somehow doesn't know it and has many male admirers who she sees only as friends. She blushes a lot, is weirdly innocent and has never really been interested in having a boyfriend. She has a rather flighty mother who she hasn't always lived with and who is a hopeless romantic/has been married several times.<br />2. Girl meets impossibly handsome and successful man with messy, copper-colored hair who makes her all starry-eyed. He sorta stalks her, calls her mysterious, and saves her from being run over. Then he tells her she should stay away from him because he's not the guy for her (but of course we all know he doesn't mean it). She dreams about him and has all sorts of bothersome feelings over his odd behavior. Oh yea, and they live in Washington.<br /><br />And that's as far as I've gotten. Will keep reading since I paid for it, I guess.<br /><br />I'll definitely say this, this E L James is crafty. I give 3 stars for an author who has managed to make a ton of money almost effortlessly, since I can't imagine the story took very much effort and the rest was probably very easy.

B00756GKBA|1.0|Since 2000, when she released the \\"Music\\" album, her music goes a little blander by each album. I'm not saying each album was horrible but this new album does nothing for me. Hard Candy, American Life, & MDNA would have to be my least favorite Madonna albums ever. I listened to this album all the way through twice, and I just can't get myself to listen to it a third time. The first single \\"Give Me All Your Luvin\\", sounds like a leftover song from a Britney Spears album. \\"Girl Gone Wild\\", just a bland pop song that Britney Spears or Jennifer Lopez would record, not Madonna. There is not really one song I care for on this album, atleast on the last few albums, there was atleast 1-2 songs that were decent. On \\"Hard Candy, I like \\"Give It 2 Me\\", on American Life I liked \\"Hollywood\\", and Confessions on a Dance Floor I liked \\"Hung Up\\", \\"Sorry\\", & \\"Jump\\".<br /><br />By the way it's looking, Madonna will never make another amazing album like her timeless classic albums, \\"Ray Of Light\\", \\"Like A Prayer\\", \\"True Blue\\", and more. I was also excited to see that she was going on tour again, but when I saw the setlist was revealed, I was a little disappointed. I prefer Madonna's classic 80's & 90's music, and not much of it was put on this setlist.<br /><br />I always have and will love Madonna, but sometimes an artist needs a break and take time to create an album. Sade waits 4-5 years and always has a smooth album she comes out with. Madonna should try something similar.
B005LAIGN2|1.0|I was really dissapointed when I watched this movie.  A fifth grader could have written a better dialog than what was contained in this so called movie. About the only facts that were true was there was a war called World War II, there were Germans, and there were B-17s, P-51s, and Tuskegee Airmen.  The rest was a bunch of made up unrealistic grade school drama.

Since I uninstalled it, my battery life has gotten much better on my kindle fire. Also, fires are not all that powerful, so I suspect I'll also get less glitches when playing Temple Run.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|I have had a Seiko Kinetic in the past and was excited to get this watch as it was an affordable automatic with a glass back, a little perk I really like. I got it in and was impressed with the quality. The wrist strap took a few days to break in and become comfortable for me. The crystal seems to be rather scratch resistant versus others that I have had. I really liked the movement of the second hand, it doesn't tick every second and instead has a sweep like an analog stop watch. Then comes the reason to have a watch: Timekeeping. This is were the watch really was a let down. I have had it a few weeks and I noticed about a week or two ago that it had gained a few minutes since it was last set. So I reset it with the national atomic clock about a week ago and checked it today. It had gained about 2 minutes in a week or so. This was pretty upsetting for me. If I had it to do again I would do a little more research and pay a little more for a more accurate watch.

B000002U6E|5.0|What can I say other then this is 1 of the most underrated artists of all time. Veary spirtul music thats great to smoke herbs to, play while watching a fish tank in a dark room or to have sex to. Great background music while drinking wine with a beautiful woman and talking. This is most likely veary openminded people with a love for nature. This isnt justin beaver, ladygaga or 50cent! This is a real artist not a gimmick to make money of your standard human/sheep that fallows the herd. This is music for people that think for them selfs and have some real cultur. Most people probly wont appreciate it like I do, you eather love enigma and think there the best or you just dont feel it, hit or miss. Theres nothing OK about this group its A+ or F even if you thought they where ok a month later you would think there the greatiest, this group will grow on ya if you dont right away love or hate them. This is my fav album of theres with 3 of my fav enigma songs ( age of loneliness)(out from the deep) and ( The eyes of truth) All of there songs and albums that I have heard our good but I think this album is the best

B007IXWKUK|4.0|By the time I'd completed the first book in the Fifty Shades trilogy, I was completely engrossed in the eccentric, and at times, unhealthy relationship between Christian and Ana. The hot and heavy erotica was still a stronghold in Fifty Shades Darker, but for me the unconventional sex scenes took a back seat to the blossoming love story.<br /><br />Where E.L. James lacks in the basics of Writing Skills 101, she seems to make up for in character development. Book two in the Fifty Shades trilogy delves deeper into the Christian Grey's past, and allows the reader a chance to understand why he's the way he is. As crazy as Christian is, I found myself routing for him, hoping he'd find his way out of Crazyville and put his dark past behind him. He's a work in progress and Ana proves to be his saving grace.<br /><br />As a woman, I was intrigued by Ana's bravery. But I couldn't decide if she was just as crazy as Christian or simply too vanilla to know better. Most women I know would run for the hills if their man was anywhere near as controlling as Christian. This guy takes controlling to a whole other level in Fifty Shades Darker. Karma also comes calling in this book, creating a mysterious,yet predictable mix to the story. At times, I was silently begging Ana to pack her bags and get out while the getting was good.<br /><br />All in all, Fifty Shades Darker lulled me deeper into the recesses of Christian's state of mind, and made me appreciate Ana's ability to love him unconditionally, no matter the cost.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|the game is fun until you find out your energy gets wasted too fast and you need it to do everything.. then you can either wait 3 minutes to build up 1 energy point or buy them with real money.

B0015AARJI|1.0|Like other recent reviewers, I believe I've succumbed to a counterfeit controller. Controller felt slightly lighter, weaker Dualshock feel, and battery charge only lasted 15-20 minutes. Also, when compared to my controller I purchased with my console, the information sticker on the back (regrading the voltage, etc) was completely different. Thankfully I'm able to return this through Amazon, but I do wish that Amazon di a better job at screening 3rd party sellers. I should have been weary at the low price. It looks like I'll be stepping into a Best Buy for the first time in 5 years to get a new, proper controller. As usual, however, Amazon's service and return policy is unmatched.

0345803485|5.0|I could hardly put this book down and found it worthy of all the press coverage it has received.  It's about time a romance with more than just \\"plain vanilla\\" sex went mainstream. I felt it was very easy to relate to and wish I could find my own Christian Grey.

B005LAIGWS|2.0|Ghost Rider has always been a niche character for Marvel Comics. The character was born out of an earlier Marvel character named Night Rider. After Marvel writers Roy Thomas and Gary Friedrich and artist Mike Ploog had rein-visioned the character into Ghost Rider during the early 70's it has always remained on the extreme fringes of the Marvel Comics universe. This wouldn't stop Sony (which owned the film rights to the character) to go ahead and adapt it for the big-screen. 2007's Ghost Rider by Mark Johnson was the first and failed attempt to turn the character into a film franchise. It still made enough money despite a near-universal panning of the film by critics and audiences alike. This turn of profit is why Sony once again dipped into the Ghost Rider well and come up with 2012's Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.<br /><br />This \\"sort of\\" sequel ditches Mark Johnson and brings in the dynamic (and I'd say somewhat insane) directing duo of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor to helm the film. It brings back Nicolas Cage for the role of Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider. Working from a script by Scott Gimple, Seth Hoffman and David S. Goyer one would think the film had nowhere else to go but up especially with the wacky and frenetic filming style by Neveldine/Taylor. To say that this sequel failed to do anything but finally give this film franchise a final nail in it coffin would be an understatement.<br /><br />Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance ditches pretty much most of what transpired with the first film and tries to retcon things for the sequel. I'd say this would've been a good idea seeing the first film was truly awful, but what the sequel ended up doing was confuse things even more. The film tries to turn the Ghost Rider persona from just a spirit of vengeance but an angelic being called the spirit of justice which had become corrupted. We get the Devil in the form of Roarke (played by Irish actor Ciaran Hinds) searching for the young boy Danny who is to be his perfect vessel.  Johnny Blaze comes into the picture after being recruited by a drunk French warrior-monk by the name of Moreau (Idris Elba whose performance was one of the lone highlights of the film) who promises to exorcise the demon from Blaze in exchange for finding and saving Danny.<br /><br />This would've been a good premise if it had several more drafts of it worked on. Though there's still a chance the film would've still sucked in the end. Even the direction from Neveldine/Taylor (Crank, Crank: High Voltage, Gamer) failed to add any heat to the proceedings. They come up with some unique camera angles and action sequences, but gone was the hyper-realistic and frenetic style they've become known for. Their previous films were not stuff to write to one's film critic circles about but they at least had a sense of fun built into them even if their stories defied any sort of logic.<br /><br />Even the performances by the cast seemed to be something that barely reached the level of one-dimensional. Nicolas Cage tries to channel his inner crazy by way of Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, but it's too little too late to save the film which never found any sort of footing on the side of competent. Really, the only good thing worth of note was my previous mention of Idris Elba as Moreau who chews the scenery every time he shows up on the screen like it was his last meal. This performance alone wasn't enough to save the film or even make it somewhat entertaining.<br /><br />Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance was not worth seeing in the theater (especially in 3D though that part of the film was actually quite well done despite being a post conversion) and I'd be willing to admit that it's still not worth seeing on video unless it was for free. What could've been a restart to the series with the inclusion of Neveldine/Taylor instead gives this franchise it's death-knell and most likely help Marvel get the rights back from Sony. Here's to hoping that the flaming skull rider stays on the fringes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for decades to come.er stays on the fringes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for decades to come.

B004DMIIOG|5.0|Anime films have been the type to make a major crossover from Japan to the United States when it comes to the US mainstream audience. While anime series typically still remain the realm of the hardcore fans of the genre the stand-alone films get much more love from mainstream critics and audiences in addition to the hardcore. One such film which looks to have made a successful mainstream crossover to the United States was the anime film Summer Wars which was originally released in Japan in August 1, 2009. The film saw it's American debut at film festivals around the country in 2010, but since I saw it in late May 2011 I consider it a 2011 release for me thus qualifying it as one of the best films of 2011.<br /><br />Summer Wars was the project of director Hosada Mamoru whose previous stand-alone anime film, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, was well-received by fans and critics alike. Working from a screenplay by Okudera Satoko (adapted from a story written by Hosada himself), Summer Wars was a nice blend of science-fiction, romance and Japanese slice-of-life. The story begins with the introduction and explanation of the OZ on-line community which becomes a major focal point to the film's story and the many characters in it. OZ was explained as an on-line, social networking community which has become so ingrained in the world community that everything anyone does was done through it's portals. Think of OZ was an amalgamation of Facebook, Second Life, iTunes, Netflix and every other social networking site all working under one umbrella. It's a virtual world where people just don't socially interact through games and chat lobbies, but also a place where every real-world store has a portal where people could purchase things online. It's also become a palce where governments from local cities to whole countries have set-up their own areas that would control their cities and countries' infrastructures. It's Facebook on steroids.<br /><br />One of the film's main characters happens to work as a part-time moderator for OZ. Koiso Keiji also happens to be a 17-year old math whiz who would become instrumental in the story to come. The bulk of the story has Keiji being invited by a high school friend in Shinohara Natsuki (explained to him as a job she needs for him to do) to come with her to her family estate where he ends up meeting the rest of Natsuki's very extended family and also it's soon-to-be 90-year old matriarch in Jinnouich Sakae. This part of the film makes up the romance and it's comedic aspect as Keiji gets introduced by Natsuki to her great grandmother Sakae as her boyfriend and future fiance much to Keiji's surprise. As Keiji tries to awkwardly play along with Natsuki's plan the second part of the film's story kick's in as he inadvertently assist someone or something into hacking into OZ and begin a sequence of events which threatens every account in OZ, but later on even threaten the world.<br /><br />This part of the story actually worked quite well due to the recent major hacking of Sony's Playstation and Qriocity networks which gave hackers access to tens of millions of account users' info. It was hard not to think about this real-life event as something similar (albeit much more massive and danegrous in scope) occurred in Summer Wars. The fact that the film was completed in 2009 and the Sony hack happened just a month ago was real life copying fiction instead of the other way around. It's this part of the story's plot which added to the thrilling aspect of the film as Keiji and others (mostly the extended Jinnouichi Clan he meets) try to take on the cause of the OZ hack (which we quickly learn wasn't a person but an advanced A.I. program released by the U.S. Army into OZ to test it's capabilities not knowing it would become self-aware and hard to control).<br /><br />Weaving in and around this science-fiction are some of what makes some Japanese anime so easily accessible to those outside of Japan. We see a slice-of-life that, at first looks to be typical Japanese daily life, but as the story moves along becomes something that everyone would recognize and have some sort of kinship with no matter their race or culture. It's the theme of family togetherness even through adversity and the occassional disagreements between family members. It's here we see Natsuki's great grandmother Sakae show the need for the family to always find time to sit down and eat dinner together no matter what problems each and everyone may be having. It's these very serene, at times quite hilarious, scenes of family life with the Jinnouichi Clan that Summer Wars will tug at audiences' heartstrings and cause more than just a few to tear up. Some have said these scenes were too maudlin and corny, but I look at that complaint as people trying to project their own cynical nature on what was really an honest look at family life and how keeping a family together through adversity (both big and small) becomes a reward unto itself.<br /><br />The Japanese voice cast did quite a good job bringing their animated characters to life from the main leads in Keiji, Natsuki and Sakae right up to the little children who added some levity to the situation. While I try to always watch anime with the Japanese language on with English subtitles for Summer Wars I also watched it with the English-voice dubbing. I was surprised to hear that the English-dubbed version was not as bad as most anime dubs and was actually quite good. Summer Wars looks to boast a who's-who of English dub voice actors which probably lent itself to a quality dubbing in the end.<br /><br />Summer Wars was produced by one of Japan's major animation studios with Madhouse and the look of the film bears this out. The virtual world which made up OZ looked beautiful and made great use of CGI-animation. The avatars used by OZ account members were inventive and a menagerie of characters that all looked to be very distinct each and everytime a new one came on the screen. The animation for the real-world aspect of the film used traditional hand-drawn animation. While it didn't have the sheen and flash of most anime series the flat-look and natural color scheme used for scenes when outside OZ lent a sense of realism and the natural that made it easier to get into the film. These two contrasting animation styles really helped in pointing out just how different OZ was to everything else.<br /><br />Hosada Mamoru's direction keeps everything from becoming a jumbled mess as the film juggles not just two major plot threads concurrently but smaller subplots involving certain individual family members of the Jinnouichi Clan. It's a testament to his handling of the film that we're never lost as the film's story unfolds. Whether it's the fake relationship between Keiji and Natsuki becoming something more real to the prodigal son coming back to the family after a self-imposed exile of ten years right up to a high school baseball tournament involving one of the family's younger members who also happens to be a star pitcher.<br /><br />In the end, Summer Wars should be seen as a landmark film that officially heralds the arrival of one of anime's great filmmakers. With the untimely passing of Satoshi Kon there's been a scramble within the anime community to find his heir apparent. Hayao Miyazaki will continue to be one of anime's godfathers and pillar of quality work, but amongst the younger generation there was really no one stepping up the way Satoshi Kon did in so short a time. I think with Summer Wars it wouldn't be too farfetched to say that Hosada Mamoru has also stepped up to join Miyazaki as one of the creative geniuses in the anime world. It also shows younger anime filmmakers that there is success to be had doing anime outside the usual mecha, mahou shoujo and shonen series which remains the backbone and meal-ticket for animation studios in Japan.<br /><br />Summer Wars is an anime film that I'd highly recommend to all whether they're fans of anime or have no idea what an anime was. This anime is that good and one that deserves to be called just film without the anime tag. It will be interesting to see what Hosada Mamoru comes up with next. I, for one, can't wait to see what it is. Also, I recommend people watch this on Blu-Ray. The difference in how the animation comes across between Blu-Ray and DVD is leagues apart.screen.

0345803485|5.0|Frustrated that her best friend/college roommate has come down with the flu on the day of an important interview, Anastasia Steele--Ana, to friends and family--agrees to help her out, although that entails driving some 165 miles in order to do so. But what are friends for, right? So she drives to downtown Seattle to keep the bedridden Kate's appointment with the CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings , Inc., one Christian Grey, who is scheduled to be the commencement speaker at their graduation. What begins as simply an annoying favor for a sick friend becomes the catalyst to the biggest change imaginable in the innocent college student's life.<br /><br />Synopsis:<br /><br />Technically, Ana is only the conduit for the interview. The questions are written out, all she needs to do is ask them, and record all the answers. Good thing, because when she meets Christian, she is so flustered by his amazing good looks, and his youth that she is a bit tongue-tied (and mentally curses Kate for not having prepared her for him).Of course, part of the fault is Ana's for not having read the questions through, and blurting out, \\"Are you gay?\\", before she wishes a hole would open up and swallow her. She barely makes it through the interview, and his slightest touch produces reactions she's never experienced before.  All in all, Ana is greatly unnerved by Christian Grey.<br /><br />Ana goes back to her life--her studies, her part-time job at the hardware store, her friends, including Jose, a photographer whom she suspects of liking her a bit too much in the wrong way--but she can't stop thinking about Christian. When he turns up unexpectedly where she works, she is flustered as she helps him gather the things that he requests--cable ties, masking tape, rope--although she can't begin to fathom why he should need these things, and he isn't exactly forthcoming with details. When Ana mentions in passing that Kate wishes they had better pictures of the young CEO to go along with the interview, Christian offers to do a photo shoot, to her amazement. An ecstatic Kate strong-arms a reluctant Jose into taking the pictures, and the next day all three show up at Christian's expensive hotel. After the photo shoot, he invites Anafor coffee, and she accepts--even though she doesn't even like it.<br /><br />Ana cannot stop thinking about him. Especially after he makes an overly generous gift to her of some very expensive first editions. She goes out with Kate and Jose to celebrate their graduation, and consuming too many drinks makes her bold; while waiting in line for the ladies room, she places a drunken call to Christian. She won't tell him where she is and hangs up on him, but the man has resources, and luckily so, saving her from an unfortunate situation, also introducing Kate to his brother Elliot. While they hit it off, Christian takes Ana with him to his hotel, where she passes out.<br /><br />It's obvious that this attraction between them is very mutual; although Christian continually tries to warn Ana away from him, telling her he's no good for her, she cannot resist him. When innocent Ana says to him, \\"You're quite the disciplinarian,\\" he responds with, \\"Oh Anastasia, you have no idea.\\" And when it reaches the point where it's obvious that something's got to give, then he reveals to her some of his nature, what he's looking for in a relationship, and he gives her a contract to sign, outlining everything in black and white. You see, Christian is a Dominant in search of a Submissive--this is the type of relationship he has with women, albeit one at a time, for he is monogamous. Although there is something he hasn't realized about Ana, which could be a deal breaker.<br /><br />Loving Christian Grey will not be easy, but Ana cannot help herself. When she's around him, she wants him so badly she can taste it. He does something to her, something very elemental, and being away from him is painful to her. But can she live with his very exacting rules? Does sheeven get a voice in this matter? And is there any wiggle room? Enquiring minds want to know.<br /><br />Commentary:<br /><br />There is no denying that Fifty Shades of Grey has become a phenomenon in the short time since its release. I became aware of the hoopla and wondered about it, especially after hearing that the story was originally a fanfiction penned by author EL James, based in the Twilight fandom. So I decided to see what the fuss was all about, and I was more than half prepared to find it unmitigated tripe, and highly questionable erotica. I've never read anything in the bdsm genre before, so I was also apprehensive that I would not like this aspect of the book either. All in all, I prepared to dislike this book.<br /><br />But a strange thing happened. From the beginning, I found the author's voice engaging, easy to read, and well developed. It flows very smoothly, and her narrator, Ana Steele, is easy to like, and I enjoyed watching her story unfold. As for Christian, well, that man is just hotter than hot, and incredibly sexy. Yet no cookie-cutter romance hero is he; he is multi-layered and multi-faceted, and very riveting as we peel away the layers, trying to find out what makes Christian tick.<br /><br />While this book is definitely for mature audiences because of its dark themes and open sexuality, it is not what I consider to be erotica. To me, erotica is sex with a bit of plot thrown in, just a step above pure smut that makes no pretense at plot. In the world of fanfiction, this is often referred to as pwp--plot, what plot? But Fifty Shades is first and foremost a romance between Ana and Christian, a very sensual romance, and the sex enhances that romance but it isn't everything, it's a part of everything.<br /><br />As for the fanfiction aspect, if I hadn't been told that was the origin, I would never have guessed it. Even knowing it, I don't really see it (and I have read the Twilight books, so I am familiar with the characters). You might make a case for Christian being the controlling Edward Cullen, while I can see a little bit, perhaps, of Bella in Ana Steele, mostly in her clumsiness and naivete, but honestly, these characters are their own, and very well developed. She basically took Twilight and reshaped it into her own story, in the same way that Leonard Bernstein took Romeo & Juliet and made it into West Side Story. Fifty Shades of Grey is its own story.<br /><br />The question still remains as to why this book, the first in a trilogy, has gone so very viral, and for that I have no real answer. It's a good book, and I like it, but there are others out there, I know. This isn't the first bdsm romance, far from it. There are m/f and m/m books out there with the same theme. My only explanation is exposure. Those other books never gained the same sort of exposure. I can only speculate that some great promotional efforts took place before its release, and if so, more power to everyone involved. It worked. Perhaps it doesn't hurt that EL James is a former TV executive, and probably has friends in high places. I should be so lucky.<br /><br />While Fifty Shades is not erotica, in my opinion, it is erotic, sensual, and romantic. I understand there is a nickname for it--Mommy porn. Intrigued, I asked a friend what that was all about, and learned that it's because the largest part of the audience that makes up the readership are women over thirty. Okay, I guess I fill that bill and then some. I think that anyone who enjoys romance will love this book, whether you're into bdsm or not. I can't say I'd read another one, outside of the trilogy. That wasn't the part of the story I found the most satisfying. For me it was all about the romance, the love.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to reading the second book in the trilogy.

0143039431|5.0|The book is beautifully written. Steinbeck's style flows so smoothly and is so accessible. The book follows the Joad family for about nine months as they are driven from the place they've called home for generations and travel to California, only to find out that it is not the land of opportunity they expected. Steinbeck's formula here is to intersperse the lengthy chapters chronicling the Joads' journey with short chapters that encapsulate some nuance about the period or the people, giving you a picture of the greater struggle taking place, of which the Joads are just a small part. It creates a very powerful effect. This migration west involved hundreds of thousands of individuals. You see in a few pages the big picture, then you are pulled back into the intimacies of the Joads' lives and the tragedy is made very personal. In one especially startling example, Steinbeck puts these words into the mouth of a character after selling a nameless migrant and his family some gas for their car, \\"Well, you and me got sense. Them goddamn Okies got no sense and no feeling. They ain't human. A human being wouldn't live like they do. A human being couldn't stand it to be so dirty and miserable. They ain't a hell of a lot better than gorillas.\\" In the next chapter, the Joads make camp along a stream and Ma is so happy for the clean water and the chance to stay put for a day so that she can take a bath and wash the family's clothes. The Joads are good, honest, decent people looking for the means to earn an honest wage and thereby feed their family. The thought of charity repels them. At one point Pa talks about the prospect of picking cotton and is so excited about the fact that it's good, hard work, worthy of the wage he'll earn. How soft and incredibly privileged it makes us all seem. \\"They streamed over the mountains, hungry and restless - restless as ants, scurrying to find work to do - to lift, to push, to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food.\\"

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B006GHA9QQ Andrew Lloyd Webber's Love Never Dies]]<br /><br />I waited several days before viewing \\"Love Never Dies\\". After seeing \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" on stage so many times over the years, it actually became a part of my life. Then, (sooner than I might have wished!), the 25th Anniversary re-staging at Albert Hall in London triumphantly proved that \\"Phantom\\" could push the limit and be even more perfect. It floored me with its subtle changes in orchestrations and characterizations, which gave new emphasis to everything I already knew, yet still surprised me. The cast was huge, the settings and lighting were stunning. I only mention the 25th Anniversary re-work because it really ought to be experienced before moving on to \\"Love Never Dies\\".<br />While the original play had all the right ingredients for a mesmerizing theatrical experience, \\"Love Never Dies\\", because of its \\"newness\\" has its own surprises, mysteries, shocks, comedy and a visually hypnotic world of beauty. It gives us a deeper, darker, convoluted look at the Phantom, Christine, Raoul, Gustave (their son), Mdm. Giry and Meg Giry...ten years after the Paris Opera House fire and the mysterious disappearance of a heartbroken Phantom. I really don't want to divulge any plot elements, because it's a whole new story. I will say that the music and lyrics vie for the splendorous sound of the original. Andew Lloyd Webber does something truly wonderful by sprinkling melodies and a few lyrics from \\"Phantom I\\" among the new score. It has an extremely comforting effect, because we are still emotionally connected, though all that unfolds on stage is its own legitimate entity.<br />From the elite Paris Opera House to the glitzy world of turn-of-the-century Cony Island? It works splendidly, just as the underground lake took our breath away in \\"Phantom I\\". The whole atmosphere is near circus-like...a circus with a constant tug of war on our emotions. The second half of the show is definitely full of midnight secrets, heart-pounding suspense and looks into the souls of those characters we think we already know. Not so!<br />\\"Love Never Dies\\" is definitely a light-framed roller coaster ride of plunges into nightmare and ascensions into glory. Order it today and experience something really great!

0871404133|3.0|Wilson is an acknowledged expert on insect biology and the social aspects of insect cooperative behavior.  His forays into human evolution are far less compelling.  This book contains worthwhile information but is substantially marred by major defects.  The first is a desire by the author to advocate to the general reader some of his more recent concepts on human evolution which are the subject of controversy among experts, and should be considered as far from proven.  The second is his repetitive assertions of value judgments which are obvious examples of conventional and certainly unproven (indeed unprovable) liberal orthodoxies, lowering his views to mere political correctness.  Such expressions deserve no place, in this reviewer's opinion, in a book written by a prominent scientist and offered to the reader as a serious but simplified scientific explanation of evolution and human genetics.

B00007GZQI|3.0|A decidedly uneven, often vicious black comedy adapted from Terry Southern's 1959 novel. Virtually plotless, the satire in director Joseph McGrath's &#34;The Magic Christian&#34; (1969) remains hit and miss. Peter Sellers delivers one of his finest performances as the wealthy iconoclast Sir Guy Grand — assisted by a deadpan Ringo Starr. Cameos aplenty, some more successful than others. McGrath handles the vaudevillian traffic to the best of his ability. Spike Milligan once summed up the cult movie's enduring appeal: &#34;You've really got to hate people to love this film.&#34;

It gets soo laggy which causes you to die and makes it almost impossible to make it past 1.5 million, so basically you'll never really complete all of your objectives. Also,  unlike the iPod version, you don't have an option to which way you hold your Kindle. So if my kindles charging and that annoying plug is in the way I cant flip my Kindle upside down and play. Plus the touch screen is so big that its hard to get a comfortable grip on the Kindle. And one accidental touch might make the character slide or jump and fall to its death or it might not even read your touch and run into a tree and not turn the corner or jump over a gap. All in all this version of temple run is soo much more annoying than the iPod version.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for this forever and I like it so much better then the I pods now were just waiting for call of duty zombies.

B007L24T52|5.0|I enjoyed this book the same as all the other books by David. I have read all his books and he is a MASTER of suspense and action. I can reccommend the book to any person who enjoy reading fiction as if it is fact. Thank you
B005P5TS5I|5.0|I missed the first episode of the seventh season a while ago and this was the best place to see it. I now just view my miss shows on Amazon.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is indeed without a doubt, an addictive game. I am absolutely thrilled Amazon has finally decided to get this app.
B0085776BG|2.0|To many themes didn't permit proper plot delevelopment. Dialog is simple and disengaged. Character development was absent. Very very disapointing. Would not recomend to anyone... in fact I would like my money and the last two hours of my life back.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This is an outstanding performance on a grand scale.  The cast is awesome but especially Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom.  The only parts I didn't like was the audience was easily seen so that was kind of a distraction but nevertheless, an all-around wonderful performance...especially the encore.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|This was one of the best cds I've gotten in a while.  I enjoy every song and can listen to them over and over and over. Thank you Adam Lambert for coming back awesome.
B007MDB71O|5.0|It is a shame this film did not do better in the theater. I saw it once and went back to see it 2 more times. I have only done that with 3 other film, Avengers, Serenity and Avatar. This film was great! It had so much more than the trailer showed. I was not familiar with the Barsoom books or that they had been written by the same author as Tarzan. This film has adventure, humor, romance and stunning visuals. It is just as entertaining and engrossing as Avatar. The film title, trailer, failed marketing and launch date in March was its downfall. This should have been titled John Carter and the Princess of Mars. It should have been a summer or Christmas holiday launch, not March. And the trailer should have been edited to encompass more of the humor and romance. I'm sorry but if you spend over 200 million making an epic blockbuster you should treat it as such. I hope Disney makes up in DVD sales. I know I'll buy myself a copy and 4-5 more for Christmas gifts to friends and family. I feel a bound duty to get the word out: Watch this film. Buy the DVD! You won't regret it.
B004L03B3S|4.0|This is a beautiful production, a very well-made film, which is partly why it can be so difficult to watch.  To be honest, I couldn't watch it all in one sitting because I so easily accepted the premise of the story & I found myself in conflict with...myself!  Instead of aiming at the \\"taboo\\" nature of the story, you realize that the producers & director aimed for the emotional bond between the brothers & how their parents tried to deal with this, never really overcoming the elements that bound these two together for life.  It is successful in that it leaves you wondering how simply and innocently this situation can develop and then, what do you do??  A beautiful story that makes you think and what more should a well-told story do??
B000OVLINI|5.0|This book was hard for me to get into, but once I did I found it magical and memorable. It tells the story of a young, aspiring writer named Daniel Sampere whose life is changed forever when he comes into possession of a dark, one-of-a-kind book called Shadow of the Wind by a vanished writer named Julian Carax. Surrounded by a haunting world still tinged by the Spanish Civil War, Daniel finds his life becoming increasingly entwined with that of the doomed Carax.<br /><br />The deeper Daniel digs to uncover the mysteries of Julian's life and disappearance, the more dark secrets are revealed about his own world.<br /><br />Shadow of the Wind is a beautiful story that probably would never be written by an American, but translates extremely well. It reminded me a bit of the movie Pan's Labyrinth in the sense that it's dark, magical, and in some ways tells the story of the Spanish Civil War. I can see this becoming a movie as well.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun little time waster.  its a nice game to pick up in between tasks.  compared to some of the other games like it this one doesn't have too many glitches.
B007EC6FIS|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this album on the first listen.  The first two albums I loved immediately.. The second two had to grow on me, and well I played this one a few times before I was in love with it..Now it's all I am listening to in my car.  They have never disappointed me, so I knew I should give this new album a chance. Glad I did, it's AMAZING! I am so excited for the tour!
0307730697|5.0|Adam Brown is a credit to everything that is right with America. He is the classic rags to riches story [not in monetary wealth, but what legacy he has left for us]. I served and have the highest respect for those who volunteer to go into harms way, as Adam Brown did.  The author describes details of Adam's life, and service to his country and life with his wonderful partner and wife.  Once you begin the book it is hard to put it down, all the time knowing in the end Adam Brown makes the ultimate sacrifice for his brothers in arms and his country.  All Gave Some, and Some {Adam Brown] Gave All.  Rest in Peace.<br /><br />Semper Fidelis.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|I bought this book because the morning time radio host I listen to was raving about it (although she hadn't read it). I downloaded it to my Andriod with a bit of speculation considering the hype that it was incredibly risque. But I truly found that I loved it!<br /><br />Didn't find it as erotic as most of the hype declared it would be.<br /><br />Easy book to fall into, no extensive prose.<br /><br />Give it a go!

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Overall I loved the entire series, but I found this book to be the most rewarding since it contains de resolution of several plot points that had been left from previous books. I highly recommend it, it was way more entertaining than watching a movie. Other stuff I liked about the author's style is his ability to switch sides and write in the mindset of the story's antagonistss, and the rythm that the story takes when all the plot points converge for the final resolution. Will miss Salander and Blomkvist!
B004TTZHBK|1.0|What a shame!! I am a big fan of Jamie Oliver and a big fan of my Kindle Fire, seems that this is not a good combination. The app does not properly work with Kindle Fire, there is no way to see the pictures of the step by step function. R
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I first read Watership Down as a middle school student. My father had suggested it to me. I was initially reluctant to read a book about rabbits, but Hazel and friends quickly won me over. I've probably read it about ten times total, and have moved from my original paperback to a replacement paperback and now also have it for my Kindle. It is my favorite book, and I would urge everyone who hasn't read it to give it a try. It's about a lot more than rabbits, but at the same time, it's a story that I loved as an unsophisticated middle school student. I think there's something for everyone in Watership Down.

B000JIHP88|2.0|The leaves appear to be too heavy for the mobile motor.  Have all ready returned the product once, for a replacement in kind, as our baby really seemed to enjoy it and we hoped it was just a fluke.  But it happened again.  Mobile will work properly and rotate for period of time (first one worked for about 2 weeks, second lasted 2 months - moderate use at bedtime) but then the motor bogs down.  Once the leaves are in the down position and the motor starts to fail, the leaves will not return to upward position and the figures do not spin.  If you take the leaves off of the mobile the figures begin to spin again but we purchased this item for its entirety, not just portions of it.  Love the idea behind this item, just wish it could hold up to moderate/average use.  Read other reviews about the same problem before purchasing the mobile, now I wish I listened to them in the first place...I don't hate the mobile but I sure don't like it b/c of the two negative experiences.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great series of games you will need to unlock. before you are able to move forward. you could be stuck playing them for a while.  very addictive.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|Simply put, this is a very bad book. If you're used to readimg books with good grammar, correct use of words and a captivating plot line, then this is definitely not the book (or series) for you.

0393088774|5.0|This is a great book describing in simple terms the income model developed by Hyman Minsky (plus other people who spent his life studying and trying to understand the follies and processes which led us in and out of the great depression) as it applies to our current economic situation.<br /><br />A great book like this can be transformational--can help you start looking at the world in a different way from the way you have been programed. As a businessman and NASDAQ company CEO I always believed the prevailing mantra: Inflation is the chief danger to our economic well-being and must be avoided at all cost.  As in the case of many of us who are immersed in the media, this belief tends to become programed and hard-wired  into every neuron.<br /><br />Then in 2008 I met David Levy in New York, whose father and grandfather worked with and mentored Minsky in the 1950's. Our company paid David $35,000 for his Levy Forecast service to help us understand the dynamics of the mess we are still working our way out of. Once  David explained the concept and we started to critically analyze the ongoing  unraveling of our economy driven by the deflation of our real estate bubble. If you care to Google it, you will find that Levy, using the same Minsky principles explained by Krugman,  predicted the ongoing housing collapse over 5 years ago. Levy has also has been predicting since 2008 the multi-year contained depression we now find ourselves in. So the model works.<br /><br />Throughout the book Krugman reinforces the concept that timid response to ravaging deflationary forces rather than inflation, is the real problem crushing our country right now. The clear, simplified explanations of the European crisis puts our own deleveraging process in context. The US stumbled on the right path but the stimulus is insufficient given the size of the residual problems. The EU and UK central bankers are confused and fighting the ghosts of the past.<br /><br />Here is a book that for less than $16 can give you the same clarity our company paid 35,000 bucks to achieve.<br /><br />Looking at the devastation of wealth over the last 5 years I reluctantly agree that Krugman is right. The quickest (and most humane) way out of this mess is to reverse the ongoing deflationary cycle and (unlike 2005-2007) for the Fed to  take their inflation-fighting job really seriously once people go back to work and start paying payroll taxes.<br /><br />Someone should give this book to Ben Bernanke to read this Summer. Better for Uncle Ben to have a \\"Minsky moment\\" reading Krugman than by managing a run on the banks as the folks in the Central Bank of Spain were doing last week.<br /><br />President John Adams thought that the chief element needed to achieve and sustain democracy is discerning, educated people. If you have gotten this far in this review President Adams meant you.<br /><br />Read this book and then in November go out and vote to put people in power with the will to get us out of the mess rather than to manipulate and use the crisis for political gain at the expense of the American people.$16 can give you the same clarity our company paid 35,000 bucks to achieve.<br /><br />Looking at the devastation of wealth over the last 5 years I reluctantly agree that Krugman is right.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|This is a review on the whole series, not necessarily on technical merit, but I needed to get off my chest how I felt about these books. I only finished the last book because I wanted to find out how their stories ended and what all the obsession was about over the series.<br /><br />I guess first I'll start with the things I liked! When Ana and Christian were acting like normal human beings and you could see the development of their emotional relationship with the flirtatious emails and opening up to each other, I thought that was adorable. I thought the action scences were fairly well done as well. I really liked the supporting cast of his family and associates and their friends. The first couple erotic scenes were pretty hot, but then they became so frequent that I only ended up reading the ones where something new happened. Which brings me to the things I didn't like.<br /><br />I know I will be echoing other reviewers' postings here, one I especially aggreed with was comparisons to Twilight and Bella, which I fee sets a bad example for young girls, just as I feel waiting for a perfect prince on a white horse is a bad idea. As someone who wasted years of her life believing that unconditional love could cure anything, even toxic emotional wounds, the emotionally needy and codependent realtionships in both these series stuck a bad cord with me. Let's start with the fact that this impossibly young (27?!?) billionaire was an incredibly jealous, stalker, control freak, who moved way too fast (marriage within 3 months or so?) which are all red flags. In the \\"real world\\" these traits a lot of times end up with dead girlfriends and wives. Take away the billionaire aspect of it and all of a sudden, it is not as attractive or romantic. As for the BDSM, if he wasn't a billionaire, he probably wouldn't have his own playroom and he would just be a guy with some whips in his closet, also not as attractive. Then Christian becomes so emotionally needy with Ana, making her intohis emotional crutch and the constant declarations of \\"you are mine\\" \\"I am yours\\" \\"don't ever leave me or I will die\\" just became too much for me. Especially when he broke down and went into sub mode, the author really lost me. I also don't feel like it sufficiently explained why he was so messed up. He was seeing a shrink constantly, had a good family he was adopted into and realized the root of his emotional problems already. Don't get me wrong, I believe that love in its best form will make you a better version of yourself, and in a few rare instances it might intersect at a time when someone is ready for change, but no one that is not a professional can solve abandonment childhood issues.<br /><br />And with Ana, the constant references to her \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconscious\\" got really old during the first few chapters of the first few books. Can I take this time to make a plea to authors, PLEASE stop assuming that just because your female lead reads old British literature it means they are beyond their years in maturity?? (i'm looking at you too, Twilight!) The fact that she was so young in this book bothered me, only 21! Maybe the story would have been better if they had each been 5 years older? Then Ana was a virgin who turns into a nyhmpho overnight! Orgasms every time! Wants to have sex with Christian in crowded elevators and cars and lobbies! The same shy girl we were introduced to in the first book? The entire series she is distraught, up and down over him, desperate to prove she loves him and catering to his every emotional whim one way or another. Ugh. I liked her in her more self-possesed moment but those seemed to be few and far between.<br /><br />I know secretly everyone wishes to be whisked off their feet by some grand love story involving billionaires with incredible sexual chemistry and the ability to emotionally heal each other. But I just don't feel like the main characters were consistent or true to themselves througout the series. One of the parts I liked the most was Christian's POV at the very end of the book on when he met Ana and went to see her at her job. I think I would have really liked his character if he hadn't been so needy and jealous all the time with insane mood swings, as I always love a good underdog, triump over tragedy story. I'm also wondering how they are going to make a movie based on this...wouldn't it just be porn? I might go see it if they adjust the characters and make it more about their emotional journey.<br /><br />Bottom line is, if they took out all the unneccesary \\"vanilla\\" sex scenes, which were all a couple pages long, condensed the story line and made the characters a little more emotionally stable, I think this could have been a fun, sexy read as one single book. This is also hoping that young girls aren't reading these books and thinking this is how relationships function. But that's just my two cents!
0718157834|3.0|Never has 480 pages sailed by so quickly. The main character is sweet, endearing, and adorable. Her kooky family members are entertaining secondary characters. And the love that develops between Lou and Will is quite profound. It builds very, very slowly and blossoms into one of the most believable loves I've seen in fiction. Because it takes Lou so much time to realize her feelings, the love is that much deeper and more real.<br /><br />Lou has her own past experiences and the lead up to that reveal is very subtle. I thought it was handled well.<br /><br />I was glad that some other voices were included. Lou joins an online forum to help her learn about disability and meets some quads who don't want to die. I wish that had been further developed, since we never get to meet a character who expresses that view.<br /><br />There's a point of view oddity. Almost the entire 480-page book is told from Lou's first-person point of view, but there are five individual chapters scattered throughout where other characters take on the narrative (Will's mother, Will's father, Lou's sister, and Will's main carer). This was extremely disconcerting. Though it was interested to get those characters' takes on things, it felt random, unplanned, and the first time it happened I had no idea it was only for one chapter, so at the next chapter I couldn't tell who was narrating for quite a while until I figured out we were back to Lou.<br /><br />The other strange thing about these point of view changes is that Will never got to speak. For a love story, how very bizarre that the only time Will was in control of the narrative was a third person prologue. After his accident, he has no direct voice and the other characters all speak and think about him. This may have been a conscious choice, since Will's biggest complaint in the book is that people do not listen to him, don't take into account what he wants.<br /><br />And then the biggest problem. I find the quad-wants-to-die plot extremely tiresome. It reeks of ableism: \\"I, an able-bodied woman with no experience of disability shall write about a quadriplegic because I read about it in the news. What should I write? How about how miserable his life must be?\\"<br /><br />I, also an able-bodied woman, have no authority to say that's not true. What I can say is that I've known quads, two of them being at the same injury level as Will and one higher. None of them have wanted to commit suicicde. They expressed to me how grateful they were to be alive and emphasized how they have grown from the experience. One told me that he had learned so much from it that his life was better than it had been. If you're going to ever read any book where the plot is quad-wants-to-die, this is the one to read. It does present a fairly balanced view of the issue. I'm reluctant to recommend any book with this plot, but I did find myself moved by it. If you do read it, I urge you to remember that whatever it might seem like from an outside point of view, many people with quadriplegia are living happy and content lives. I've never met a quad who wanted to kill himself. I know that some do, certainly. But every novel with a quad character seems to have this exact same plot, so we have plenty of those narratives already. I wish we had more variety in these narratives.<br /><br />I was reluctant to read the book knowing this was the plot, but I am actually glad that I read it. I enjoyed it, found the writing good, and would recommend it with the above caveat.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have is definitely Will's lack of voice and perspective.tiresome.

0385523912|4.0|The author has managed to weave together the real lives of a selection of defectors to form a coherent storyline, a gripping whole narrative. This book covers the lives of north koreans living through the 1990's and early 2000's under the chaotic rule of Kim Jong-Il.<br />This is a fascinating read, by a skilled writer fully acquainted with her topic, and I well recommend it.

0805209999|5.0|The conclusion that you must reach from The Trial is that mankind does not deserve to exist.  We are all, everyone of us, reprobates deserving of the worst kind of death.  Kafka left me morbidly depressed for days.  No other book has ever affected me so intensely.  Yet, I hated it.  Be warned that there is no way that you can read this book and not be affected.  However, you will not be able to put it down.<br /><br />The Trial was both the best and worst book that I have ever read.  It is not for the faint of heart.

0743289684|5.0|I have read some negative reviews here and was shocked how ignorant these people are. Did they read the book or just leafed through it? Hirsi Ali NEVER SAID Koran talks about female circumcision, on the contrary, she said Koran talks about male circumcision but NOT the female one.<br />And on the culture/religion issue: religion shapes the culture 100%. Examples: women in Spain have never covered themselves before moors' invasion of Perinea peninsula. The same is true about Russian women before the Tatar invasion. Afterwards, even after the Muslim invaders were drown away, female seclusion became the part of these European cultures.<br />Anyway, Hirsi Ali is an amazingly talented and her book is outstandingly brilliant. I would love to read more of her writings!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this app. no hang ups, doesn't freeze.  all the deals are not easy wins. would definitely recommend this app
0393339882|5.0|This book is exceptionally written.  The explanations of the concepts are very clear and thorough and concise, without being dumbed down.  He really does an outstanding job of bringing the characters to life, and, even as a scientist, giving me a new found respect for the scientists involved in quantum mechanics.  This is the rare nonfiction that will keep you up late at night, reading \\"just one more chapter\\" before turning in.  Highly recommended to both those with a scientific background and those just interested in learning scientific history.
B0086700CM|5.0|great game if u don't have it u need to get it<br />vvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyy addicting&amp; extremely awesome I recommend it a billion times best thing is its free
B007IK44CK|3.0|If you like special effects, this is definitely for you. AS for the storyline, in my opinion, it doesn't compare with those of the original. The acting is so-so, but in this particular genre that is almost expected.  I bought it for my husband and both he and the friends he watched it with loved it, so I would say it is definitely more of a man's movie.
0345803485|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!  Loved the characters and the story just gets better and better.  Wish this was more than just a trilogy!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|frist when I started too read this book was little on the slow start. Then it started too pick up after that. Really don't like How writer of this book Made<br />this so call rich guy, a bully too this young girl who next touch a man in her years she waited. Whole thing rules don't touch him and not look at him<br />off the wall. Still reading it. I will read the other two books.

B00846REIS|5.0|As much as I loved Christian grey & 50 shades, Gideon Cross takes the cake.<br />Absolutely hated the way ithe book eneded, but from a literary stand pint it could have used more of a cliff hanger.<br />I cannot wait until the second book. All of the characters are absolutely amazing. Hope this is a long Saga.
B00821OULY|2.0|The group of people who were giving humans to the skitters are captured by the survivors and let off with a warning . . . NEVER TO DO IT AGAIN.<br /><br />Is this total BS or what. This is more stupid than anything I've seen in the last several years of stupid TV series.<br /><br />Can you imagine in WWII, a group of American GI's running across a group of Germans that had been giving American prisoners to the SS who were killing them and the American GI's letting them go with a STERN WARNING. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. This is even worse than stupid. It's pathetic and an insult to the viewers intelligence.<br /><br />The only thing that would have made sense, especially under the circumstances that it is war, that they be executed summarily.<br /><br />This series goes from being passably good to pathetically stupid and insulting.
6305781427|3.0|Once again Yanni has excelled, his excitement and enthusiasm is so contagious,to watch his DVD is to actually attend his concert!! Get it!!!
B00821P7FM|3.0|The survivors in this TV series rival the \\"Lost\\" survivors in stupidity. I'm not sure whether stupid characters are just an easy way for writers to evolve plot or what.<br /><br />In this episode, the survivors we have been following for the last 5 episodes give over all there children to one fella who several of them know, to be taken to a \\"safe\\" house before a skitter attack.<br /><br />I could smell a rat the first thing when I saw this guy.<br /><br />I won't write a spoiler, but the stupidity of this bunch just does not make any sense. How people so stupid could survive after an alien invasion just doesn't make sense.<br /><br />The only thing that keeps me from giving this a one star is the little bit of action in it.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This book should be in every personal library.  It will definitely add meaning to any life. A touching story and more importantly, a philosophy of life that will lift any soul to new heights.
B004CSKCS6|5.0|When Anchor Bay entertainment split in half and fell apart (bought out by starz inc.) I thought their impressive horror library would never make it to Blu-Ray. That is until a buddy of mine from the UK told me that Arrow Media bought most of the Anchor Bay Library and would release those titles in a Ultimate, End All Collection. WOW is what I say when I see the treatment Arrow Media has given to titles like Battle Royale.<br />The Battle Royale 3 Disc Edition from Arrow Media is better than I could've ever imagined, Ten Times better than the recent US release. 7 hours or more of Special Features, I had to split it up over a seven day period but it was worth it. Ladies and Gentlemen if you like this Film get this version of it. It's just that simple.
1423101502|5.0|To summarize the plot of this book in three sentences, I would say that Percy gets into a war. His friends were maimed. He wins back Olympus. The main themes in this book include Friendship, Hardship, and Comedy. These themes relate because life is full of comedy, hardship and friends.  The main character of the story could be described as Loyal because he never leaves his friends behind. I would describe the author's writing style as suspenseful.  One quote from the book that illustrates this is \\"A bellowing noise sounded across New York\\".  My favorite scene was where Percy is Fighting Kronos because it is action packed.  The climax of the story is exciting because there is a lot of action. The ending of the story is satisfying because Percy beats Kronos.  If there were one question I would ask the author, it would be how are you so good at writing. I would recommend this book to a friend because it feels like it actually is happening.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I love the story line, I'm a romantic and this couple will give that too you. I only read one review and I'm glad because I thought about what that person said while I was reading it. This book will no appeal to everyone, but there's a reason it's been number one. I have  it on my kindle and I will but the hard copies too.  Leave you mind open when you read this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This for me was a page burner. I truly could not put it down. I read a lot of books and am suprised at some of the low ratings. The context may not have been your thing but the story flowed and the characters grew with the story. Hands down the best triology to read.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is sooooo mega addictive. you start playing and then you dnt wanna put it down. fun for all ages
B00005JLR2|5.0|This is a beautifully animated movie. The artwork and some of the scenery that they created is inspiring. I truly feel that this movie was not given the credit it deserves.<br /><br />It is full of interesting and original characters that stand out amazingly well, and the world the artists created is stunning. I love watching this movie, both for the imagery, and the strength of the characters.<br /><br />For anyone that has dreamed about, or for, things they have never been able to quite touch...this movie will speak volumes. It is about dreams, and finding strength and a value of self you never knew you had.
0545123291|3.0|I read Shiver, the first book in the series, and I wasn't too impressed. However, I was curious enough about the rest of the series to pick up the second book. I actually enjoyed this book more than the first. The main thrust of the story was not strictly on Sam and Grace, two characters who I find to be very boring and typical. The introduction of Cole and Isabel into the story as more than just passing characters greatly improved the action and the conflict. Cole and Isabel are hard to like at times, but that keeps the book moving along. I still have issues with the physical romance that is present in this series, but unlike the first book, none of the characters had sex in this one. One character actually rejects another in a bit of a moral twist, which I found surprising considering how easily Sam and Grace jumped into bed in the first book. (Since I am a sixth grade teacher, I view everything through the lens of appropriateness for sixth graders, and I just don't find sex in a teen book appropriate.) Anyway, this book ends with a bit of a cliffhanger, so I will most likely read the last book just to find out what happens. I still don't understand what the hype is for this series. In two books I haven't read anything that I thought was amazing or hugely original.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|The first season set these characters in a modern setting and gave us glimpses into how they work. This second season shows us what happens when malign forces don't permit them to work. This season takes on complex villains, multinational plots, and forces the characters to behave in ways so unexpected they appear downright shocking. The three feature-length stories take pleasure in pushing the characters right up to the breaking point.<br /><br />As before, these three feature-length mysteries, driven by character rather than plot, start with the story we know, but turn it ninety degrees from our expectations. We think, when we see a title like \\"The Hounds of Baskerville,\\" that we know what we are about to see; and we're partly right. But Moffett and Gatiss succeed in this series most profoundly because they don't simply retell Doyle's classic stories they renew them.<br /><br />I especially appreciate the fact that the story never stops feeling like an ascent. We never reach a point where I feel like the story has hit a plateau so the writers or actors can do some virtuoso display and show off for us. Every moment matters, sometimes in ways we can't initially see. And because every moment matters, the entire series builds to a cliffhanger conclusion so intricate that I can't see how they will resolve it. Yet.<br /><br />With a story this well beloved, it would be easy for the creative team so shrug their way through, especially since Moffett and Gatiss have their fingers in another wildly successful franchise. We would enjoy it if it simply took a straight, unimaginative tack. But the creative team respects their source, their work, and their audience enough to go further, and fulfill some very profound promises. And that's why we will surely keep coming back.

0345803485|3.0|I want to preface this review by saying that this is not the typical book that I endulge in - so I really have nothing to base my opinion on.  A friend of mine told me months ago that she heard about it and read it and that I HAD to read it so she would have someone to talk about it with.  This is way before all the hype.  So I did..... and it was awkward.  I had mixed feelings from the very beginning.  Some of it was hard to read, and I almost felt embarrassed reading it on the iPad (alone, at home).  The story was addicting and it definitely draws you in.  It wasn't the explicit sexual scenes that really had me embarrassed - it was the FLUFF.  Some of the words the author uses to describe certain things, and Ana's stupid inner goddess.  I mean seriously - I was ready to slap her.  It was just SO CORNY!!!!  I can't remember which book it was in, but at one point her inner goddess was wearing a feather boa and doing backflips.  REALLY?<br /><br />OK - so here's the point of my review.  Is the story good?  Ehh - it's ok.  Is the plot addicting?  Yeah - it is - it will keep you turning the pages.  Is it well written?  Absolutely not, under any circumstances.  Will you feel dirty?  Probably - maybe a little!  :)  Enjoy.
0060574216|2.0|I seriously kept trying to finish this book, but i could not handle the fact that it is the most REPETITIVE thing i have ever read in my life. He states the same thing  in about a trillion different ways. I get the point after you tell me once. Each section is basically the same concept repeated over and over. Waste of time and money. Horrible read.
0345803493|3.0|If you liked book one, then you'll like this one.  If you thought book one was OK, you'll feel the same about this one.  It's more of the same, except, you do get a deeper look at the life of Christian Grey and what makes him 50 shades of..... (you know the rest).<br /><br />Ana and Christian are back, and they're up to their same old tricks.  Except this time, the story is a little deeper, the scenarios are a little sillier, and unfortunatelly, her inner goddess is back and this time, she's wearing Burberry.  The books draw you in, but I'm not one of those people obsessing over Christian Grey.  Honestly, there's really not much else I have to say about this book - the ending is a little ridiculous, but just opens the door for the third installment.

B001VLBDD0|4.0|Viewed: 6/07<br />Rate: 7<br /><br />6/07: Considering the year that Terminator 2: Judgment Day was made, I've got to be surprised it had been a while to the point where there is a recent influx of pictures with high dependency of special effects in less than a decade. Yet Terminator 2: Judgment Day is neither the film that The Terminator is nor an exhilarating movie experience. Rather it was a chore for me. The first hour was crippled with excessive show-off of special effects and horrendous acting, not to forget to mention the annoying presence Edward Furlong emitted. Surprisingly, Terminator 2: Judgment Day made serious improvements in the second hour with less reliance on special effects as well as everybody's acting had greatly improved. The final thirty minutes of the picture was a reminiscent of Cobra's ending. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the only thing watchable in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, and that's why I got interested in this second part. The original was way ahead of its time, a classic in its own right, but Terminator 2: Judgment Day was half of that. A quite overrated picture that offers nothing but flash-in-the-pan stuff. Special effects alone do not constitute movies, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day was quick to correct itself in the second hour. As to the story, it is not too bad at all, but it certainly almost feels like as if I've went through this already before. This is probably a stupid question. Say, if Kyle Reese wasn't born until maybe around 2000, following the logic of time, John Connor would be born around 1984 or so. Then, the question is...who comes first? John. So, my point is: if John was first, how could Kyle be his father, considering that Kyle would need to be alive in 2029 or something and get to 1984? To elaborate further, if Kyle wasn't there, then how John can be born? If a different father, does that alter the make-up of the leader? If you think about it, you know that you have a stupid dilemma on hand that would defeat logic. Considering how good the original, I rather not pursue it because I know the logic is self-defeating. As for Terminator 2: Judgment Day, it was too overlong chore for me. Today, the picture has since become vastly overrated. Stick with the original.Considering how good the original, I rather not pursue it because I know the logic is self-defeating. As for Terminator 2: Judgment Day, it was too overlong chore for me.

B00005N5S5|5.0|Viewed: 11/03, 6/07, 6/12<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />6/07: The Terminator is so good that it is an absolutely devastating picture. This is the film that made Arnold Schwarzenegger famous. So famous that if the film wasn't made, he wouldn't be the governor of California today. The bodybuilding work in the former days has served Arnold extremely well because he was born to be ready to play the Terminator. His Terminator is a magnificent villain. So unstoppable that it is impossible to conceive something so awesome as itself. There are many great scenes in The Terminator, and even the ones when the Terminator goes in a slow-motion in a menacing but mission-driven look before he unleashes firepower on those poor hapless victims. The Terminator is lightly, perhaps some medium, a horror picture but heavily of a science-fiction kind. The truth of the birth of the role for Arnold is when he was arranged to meet the director James Cameron in some restaurant, Arnold wanted to audition for the role of Kyle Reese. But James Cameron looked at him and said, \\"My God! You're the Terminator!\\" Arnold replied, \\"No, no, no...I want to play Kyle.\\" At that, Cameron goes, \\"Absolutely not! You are the it. A machine!\\" Of course, I am paraphrasing, but you get the idea of the magnitude. One actor did not earn enough credit for his work, and that is Michael Biehn. He totally set the tone of the picture by heightening the realism along with the stark tone in how he described the Terminator and the future. He really created The Terminator the film by his attitude, and Arnold Schwarzenegger did the rest of the work. His performance as the Terminator is 100% pure Oscar work. The reason for this is his ability to create this robotic feel, movement, and action. Combining all of that with his brawn, who can replace Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator? Meanwhile, we can thank Stan Winston and his staff for their excellent special effects work. Yes, The Terminator is one of the greatest and most influential films ever made. Before The Terminator, there was nothing like it. A haunting, devastating, and thrilling picture.<br /><br />6/12: This is the film that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a household name, and he will continue to be one forever. The Terminator is a devastating picture because how do you really stop a Terminator that is made of all metal? I thought the last thirty minutes was a bit ridiculous and illogical. I've been thinking that a machine should do everything as perfectly yet it couldn't correctly aim for Sarah and Reese amid the chase? That's impossible. Also, it's just may as well be so that all of the three end up in a factory that happens to be unlocked for them, and it seems perfectly capable of dealing with the Terminator. Reese summed up the film succinctly well and what it means to face the Terminator, \\"Listen, and understand. That Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.\\" All in all, despite the logic flaws, The Terminator is filled with classic scenes and will always be regarded as a masterpiece.luential films ever made.

B005OZE9SA|4.0|I purchased the 2i2 after purchasing a brand new computer. Figured it was time to upgrade my interface for both listening and recording purposes (although, mainly for listening.)<br /><br />The device is great and works well and the drivers are easy to set up. I'm running Win 7 64-bit with Sonar 7 and Reason and the drivers are fine. Just make sure you're downloading the most recent ones from their website (not from the supplied CD)<br /><br />The Focusrite Scarlett plugin software is a a pain to install and customer support takes FOREVER to get back to you and they are completely unhelpful. The way they have you register it is completely weird and different from any other software I've had to register. Follow the instructions. I ended up figuring it out and the plugins are pretty decent.<br /><br />As far as the audio goes:<br /><br />For recording, this thing is great. Sounds as good as any interface I've ever used. Good preamps. Low noise floor. Very low latency. As clean as anything I've ever used for voice and brass.<br /><br />For listening, I was a tad bit disappointed. It definitely doesn't sound BAD by a long shot. But I was purchasing this to UPGRADE from an Alesis USB mixer, which I figured had a relatively low quality D/A A/D converter. I went with the Scarlett (as opposed to something like M-Audio) because everyone says that Focusrite has some of the best sounding devices for the price. After doing some extensive A/Bing with the Scarlett, the USB Mixer and my computer soundcard (with monitors, computer speakers and high quality headphones), and I've come to the conclusion that the Alesis actually sounds BETTER. Both the master level and the headphone level on the device don't get particularly loud, but that's okay because I probably won't ever turn it up that high.<br /><br />Pros: Price, build, preamps, latency, recording quality<br /><br />Cons: Software registration is goofy, listening sound quality is only OKAY<br /><br />I'd still recommend this device.

0345803493|4.0|Yes. We have figured out by now that Christian is beautiful, hot, erotic, a Greek god, sexy, complicated, etc, etc, etc, etc.<br /><br />Sorry, but there are only so many ways to write sex scenes before they become ho-hum, yawn.<br /><br />\\"Argh\\" and \\"ah\\" really don't cut it in a sex scene. Pirates say \\"argh,\\" not orgasmic women.<br /><br />Christian's eyes are going to pop out of his head if he goes wide-eyed yet another time.<br /><br />A thesaurus is helpful to avoid \\"dryly\\" and \\"mildly\\" as the only speech modifiers.<br /><br />By now, I'm surprised that Ana can even sit down (and I'm not talking about spanking). Cripes, you'd think she'd have at least one bladder infection after all that horsing around.<br /><br />Men do not gasp. Not much, anyway, regardless of what they're doing. Nor do they groan their girlfriend's name every single time they, well, you know, finish. Would if that were true.<br /><br />\\"Oh my\\" just doesn't cut it when thought every single time. (ahem) There are quite a few more colorful phrases that are available for the choosing.<br /><br />Regardless of the unpolished writing style that can drive me to the edge of insanity at times, \\"Darker\\" is a worthy follow-up to \\"Grey\\" and an effective bridge between the first and third books of the trilogy. But you were going to read it anyway, weren't you?

1594203334|4.0|Pregnant with my first child I figured reading this book couldn't hurt, and I'm so glad I did! It helped me realize how so many of my ideas on parenthood are culturally influenced (like all of them!) It helped me to see a different way of looking at parenting. I was particularly interested in the sleeping topics because I was preparing to not sleep for a year, just assuming that's what it means to have an infant. Not that reading this book guarantees my baby will sleep through the night at 3 months, but it is good to question some of the assumptions I had and learn some new ideas to try out.<br /><br />Very interesting book that helps you see American culture through a new lens and think about why we do the things we do - for better or worse!

B007KLY8FA|5.0|First, what a remarkable value this set represents. Eight albums for the price of less than two is a bargain no matter which way you look at it. Here is what you get. I am going to refrain from including a review of each because the reviews on the product pages for these albums say it better than I can. Plus you can listen to sound samples on those pages.<br /><br />- [[ASIN:B0048VZ1GU Chamber Music Of The New Jazz]] from 1955.<br /><br />- [[ASIN:B0048152XM Count 'Em 88]] from 1956.<br /><br />- The otherwise out of print Live At The Spotlight Cafe 1958. About half of [[ASIN:B0000001NW Ahmad's Blues: Live At The Spotlight]] contains the tracks, which are Stompin' at the Savoy, That's All, Girl Next Door, Squatty Roo, Autumn in New York, Taboo, Secret Love, Should I and Wish I Knew.<br /><br />- [[ASIN:B004A4HURI Ahmad Jamal At The Pershing]] from 1958 (reason enough to buy the entire set in my opinion!)<br /><br />- [[ASIN:B00491CATU Jamal At The Penthouse]] from 1959.<br /><br />- [[ASIN:B004GJPFXI Happy Moods]] from 1960.<br /><br />- [[ASIN:B0012F9DUK All of You / AHMAD JAMAL]] from 1961.<br /><br />- [[ASIN:B003UJ2VE6 Standard-Eyes]] from 1961.<br /><br />As you can see, there is a lot of music in this set, some of which is now out of print and otherwise unavailable (as I write this). Visit the individual pages, tally up the total if you purchase them individually and you will clearly see that even if you want only three or four of the albums, it's more cost effective to purchase this set.<br /><br />Now for the bad: if you rip to MP3 devices or upload to Amazon's cloud, three of the discs come up as 'unknown' and the tracks are titled 'Track 1', etc., instead of the actual names of the songs. It is easy enough to edit the album names and song titles to reflect what is actually on the discs, but is a pain. On the other hand, at the bargain price I was willing to expend the effort and do so with a smile.<br /><br />While I hope the publisher will correct the missing disc and track information, I can still wholeheartedly recommend this set to anyone who wants some of Ahmad Jamal's best early work.sing disc and track information, I can still wholeheartedly recommend this set to anyone who wants some of Ahmad Jamal's best early work.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Can't install it on my LG Optimus V running stock ROM. Running a custom ROM it installs, but force closes whenever you try to run it.<br />Might be a cool app for all I know, but I'm gonna rate it 1-star until I can actually use it...
B000W7JWUA|5.0|A friend of mine had this game, and recommended it to me.  I was a bit skeptical because I could not see the \\"conflict\\" in the game, which tends to add to a games excitement.  My 14 year old daughter set the game up quickly but struggled with the rules.  They are a bit complex, but once you actually play through the situations, it actually makes a lot of sense.  The rules end with a glossary of rules, which we found very helpful.  The game play is fast, entertaining, and friendly.  While not a cooperative play game, sometimes it felt that way when you trade resources.  It's actually quite surprising how friendly the game is, compared to say, Monopoly where you win by decimating the opponent and putting them into bankruptcy.  Not so with this game, everyone is doing well at some point or another, and the winner is the one who does the best, not eliminates the opponents.  Nice.  We play this quite often and it a great game for middle schoolers and high schoolers.  It holds their attention quite well, gets them talking to each other and thinking about trades that are both good for them, and good for their opponents and its really fun.  I love this game!
B0086700CM|5.0|No complaints about this game its just fun. Works great on my kindle fire ... I haven't figured out how to block accidently buying coins... but it also hasn't been a problem.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is for ages 7 to any age. You can always play it it can be hard but fun and don't be mad is u miss up hurt play again
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down....I read the entire thing in just a couple of days. Very well written and keeps you wanting more. It's not a book I would recommend for teenagers, as it has quite a few very intense sexual scenes. I think this is a series I could read over and over! Can't wait for more from E.L. James!
B0015DYIH2|1.0|The baby--Renesme--is as disgusting as her name. Why does everybody think she's adorable? She just basically ate her out of her mommy--the godess or brats-- and the birthing scene was like a carwreck or a horror movie. One review before mine said something like it would make the creators of the Saw franchise proud. I know it won't mean much because I'm the kind of person who spends their time reading one-star reviews of what is debatably the worst novel ever published (and all that I've had published is one  measly, anonymous short story, unless my medieval grotesque vampire killing novels succeed), but I salute whoever said that.<br />  &#34;Oh, isn't darling Renesme adorable?&#34; No, IT'S not! It's a sick, mutant creature, spawn of the crappiest &#34;heroine&#34; (if indeed you could refer to Bella as such) ever and a blood-sucking, self-absorbed, ancient, flat--albeit HOT, as I was reminded on every page--sparkly marble-statue vampire!<br />  And Jacob fell instantly in love with his old girlfriends repulsive off-spring.<br />  Okay. Let me make this very clear. VAMPIRES DO NOT SPARKLE!!! And vampire baseball in the first book? Oh, you know ancient bloodsuckers and their baseball. Whatcha gonna do?<br />  God...

B005FITIDC|5.0|\\"There are too many, you can't help them all.\\" Sam Childs (Butler)is a drug addict biker who has just been released from prison. Upset that his girlfriend is no longer stripping he leaves to go drinking with his friend. After picking up a hitchhiker an event happens that changes Sam's life. When a church event introduces him to the problems in Africa he travels over to see if he can help. There are movies that you love so much that you can watch over and over and love it every time. There are some you put in make popcorn and are entertained for a few hours. There are some that make you think after they are over and begin good conversations. Then there are movies like this one. The ones that have the possibility to change things. Much like \\"Hotel Rwanda\\" this movie opens your eyes to the atrocities that are happening and make you wonder why this is the first time many have heard about it. Also like that movie though because it's so emotional and not full of CGI it is not promoted the way it needs to be to get people to see it. Without going on a rant here I will just say that this is a movie that NEEDS to be seen and hopefully the right people will see it and do something. Overall, a movie that needs to be seen and felt. A one time watch but a must see one time watch. I give it an A+

You are sopposed to rate this game on the actual game you morons! So don't blame Imangi Studios, blame your freakin device! Godness but any ways this is a great game and I would totally recomemd it on kindle fire!:)-
B004EPZ07U|3.0|I'm not trying to be offensive or get a cheap laugh but this did bother me a bit. To me, Hector Hammond looked like he had down syndrome or some other horrible thing. When you see Ryan Reynolds perfectly handsome character just abusing the crap out of Hector Hammonds body (he's in a wheelchair!) its ridiculous. Which why I'm okay with this movie, its campy without trying to be, which makes a true camp masterpiece. It takes itself seriously to the degree of insanity. It is not a great movie, not by a long shot, and this is not a great lone viewing experience. But have some friends with you and you can have a fun time riffing on the sheer craziness on this film.
0785152458|5.0|This was absolutely AWESOME.  It is a most worthy sequel..... it doesn't rehash, it doesn't grasp for where to go next, it has its story, with existing characters, and just does it.  Highly recommended.  If you liked the first one, you will like the second.
B0086700CM|4.0|Grabbed it for free and would have paid for it. Great game to pass time with. Highly recommended for just about anyone.

030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn had proved herself a true force to be reckoned with with her first two novels.  When starting her latest GONE GIRL I expected the same - superb storytelling intelligently written with suspense and thrills galore.  What I didn't expect was for her to exceed her already set high bar into the stratosphere.  This novel is honestly one of the best books I have ever read and I can't remember the last time a novel was such a page turner for me from beginning to end.<br /><br />The story starts with a simple plot.  A wife goes missing, the husband doesn't react as people think he should and becomes the prime suspect.  The story begins being told from the perspective of both the wife Amy and the husband  Nick.  Her story is told through diary entries and his through present day narration.  This novel is very rare for it is a true psychological thriller in true Hitchcock fashion.  All the characters are three dimensional and jump off the page.  The reality of all the situations and the characters makes the story that much more addictive and mezmerizing.  Neither Nick nor Amy are perfect and we find out about them more and more as the story unfolds.  They are flawed people with both positive and nergative traits.<br /><br />Author Gillian Flynn does the amazing here for when writing the story flows in a realistic sense while she drops the red herrings and plot twists that the reader will never see coming.  Everything is part of a story Ms. Flynn obviously understood 100% before starting writing.  The novel is so perfect in its storytelling, character develpopment and true surprises that to write any more about the story and plot itself would honestly totally ruin the experience for readers.  Suffice it to say if you enjoy intelligent thrillers, novels where you honestly don't know what will happen and characters that are so real it becomes as if you know them you must read this novel.  Gillian Flynn writes with intense authority and she guides the reader through the story from beginning to end.  Once you think you know what will happen something totally unexpected occurs instead.  And the magic lies in the fact that there is no plot manipulation here, nothing that the reader will stop and have disbelief over.  When done reading this superb novel it will stay with you for a long time.  You will be in awe of how Ms. Flynn managed to make such an intricately plotted story so believable and thrilling.  This is true psychological suspense at its best.  Cannot recommend this book enough.the story from beginning to end.

034552554X|5.0|As an avid reader, I typically borrow books from friends or check them out from the library. When I love a book, I purchase it and pass it on.  Such is the case with \\"The Language of Flowers.\\"  The author masterfully engages the reader in the art of communication and understanding.  A well written, thought provoking page turner that leaves you hoping for a garden full of roses, aster and heliotrope for its characters.
B0086700CM|5.0|its so awsome that they put temple run on the kindle. the game is awesome and I totally recommend it.
B007712XAU|5.0|I caught the tail end of an episode of Downton Abbey while channel surfing and was immediately hooked.  After raving about it to a friend, I soon realized I was way behind and needed to catch up. Since I found it on PBS, I opted for this series and have been completely satisfied with the quality and content. Amazon gifted me with unlimited streaming in my Video Library so I ended up watching the entire Seasons 1 & 2 before my DVDs even shipped...yes, it is that good!
B0086700CM|1.0|This is usually an awesome app, but everytime you swipe to turn on kindle fire it jumps. Please fix it, its rather annoying.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|In this book suzanne colins did some prety amazing stuff. If you didn't like the last book (wich I think is awsome) this book will make the last book better. Im not sure what to call it but it gives them an edeg 'more of a meaning'.

B005GG0MIS|5.0|If you are a political junkie or Presidential history buff, this is the book for you.  I learned something in each chapter about the various Presidents and could not help but gain respect for each one of them.  The biggest Surprise was Nixon, revealed in all his flaws and more importantly his insight into local and national politics and his spot on World Vision.  His post Presidency was remarkable and helped those Presidents he served.  A must read...

I've enjoyed this Dream Cast Concert just as much, especially with Colm Wilkinson---he's the absolute best!

1401937268|3.0|With this tarot deck, Doreen Virtue and Radleigh Valentine bring a positive-only spin to the world of tarot.  Steve A. Roberts illustrates this deck with computer enhanced realistic images, loaded with vibrant colors and details that may make you wish the cards were bigger.  However, this deck is a mix.  On one hand, this deck should be easier for beginners with its key phrases at the bottom.  On other, the cards are thick and difficult to shuffle, and sometimes the imagery is confusing.<br /><br />The color on the border surrounding the cards varies.  There is ample border to allow enough space for labels on top and key phrases on bottom.  However, unlike many other Tarots, the space allowed for the image on the card varies between Major Arcana, Court Cards and Pip Cards; the Major Arcana have the least while the Pip Cards have the most.<br /><br />On the Major Arcana, the border around the image is purple.  Each Major Arcana is numbered and labeled at the top.  The name of the corresponding archangel is written just below the card name.  A few key phrases are written at the bottom.  These cards are numbered 0 to 21 starting with The Fool.  Justice is 8 while Strength is 11.  Some of the cards have been renamed to complement the \\"positive\\" theme of this deck:<br /><br />0. The Dreamer - 0. The Fool<br />5. Unity - V. The Hierophant<br />12. Awakening - XII. The Hanged Man<br />13. Release - XIII. Death<br />14. Balance - XIV. Temperance<br />15. Ego - XV. The Devil<br />16. Life Experience - XVI. The Tower<br />20. Renewal - XX. Judgment<br /><br />Some of these cards repeat the imagery with minor alterations.  This is the case of The Fool and Ego which repeat the image of the fool, and The Emperor and The Wheel which repeat the image of Archangel Michael.<br /><br />The Minor Arcana are divided into elements: Fire (wands), Water (cups), Air (swords), and Earth (discs).  Each suit of the Minor Arcana is bordered with a different color: Red for Fire, Blue for Water, Indigo for Air, and Green for Earth.<br /><br />Also each suit corresponds to a specific creature: Dragons for Fire, Mermaids for Water, Pegasus and Unicorns for Air, and Fairies for Earth.  This is where the imagery is a bit disappointing.  While the rendering of archangels in the Major Arcana is very good, the rendering of dragons in the suit of Fire is a bit lacking.  Fortunately, other creatures are rendered much better in their respective suits.<br /><br />The Court Cards are labeled at the top as Page, Knight, Queen and King.  A few keywords are written below the label, with phrases at the bottom.  The Pips are labeled at the top, with phrases at the bottom.  The imagery in the Pips always incorporates the suit symbols, but in a few times the symbols are the main focus of attention and the card becomes a decorated pip.  However, in many of the Pips you end up using the key phrase for interpretation rather than the image.<br /><br />This kit includes a small Guidebook.  The first section addresses the origin of this deck, how to use it and a few layouts.  The second section addresses the Major Arcana, with two pages per card including image, a brief description and additional meaning.  The last section addresses the Minor Arcana, with one page per pip card including image, a brief description and additional meaning, and one page per court cards including image, situation, people, and additional meaning.<br /><br />In all, your millage may vary.  If you like oracle cards from Doreen Virtue, you will enjoy this tarot.  However, if you lean toward darker tarots, you may want to stay away from this one.  As for tarot collectors, this deck is kind of unique.  Just don't place it toward the top of your list.Indigo for Air, and Green for Earth.<br /><br />Also each suit corresponds to a specific creature: Dragons for Fire, Mermaids for Water, Pegasus and Unicorns for Air, and Fairies for Earth.

B007ZJDGXC|4.0|A great movie!!  Denzel and Reynolds are great. There is tons of actions, exciting car chases and many surprises.<br />It was pleasantly entertaining etc....
B0086700CM|5.0|I have this game on my ipt and now on my kindle they have it yeaaaa I love this game
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|It was a decent movie.  I wasn't as good as previous Underworld's, but it wasn't bad.  It is entertaining, especially if you like this type of movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You won't be disappointed. And you might as well purchase book two now...trust me it will happen the moment you finish book one.
B0086700CM|4.0|Its a fun app that tests your mind. At first its hard but after a cuple mins u get the hang of it.
B00004SYZ8|5.0|This was one of the best albums I purchased in a long time. His music is very good, especially the percussions, he has a good mellow vibe.
B006XOBFTM|3.0|First off, don't be misled. This set is hardly \\"definitive\\". When Walter came to conduct most of the recordings in this set his energy had been compromised by heart attacks and failing health. He was also conducting the Columbia Symphony, a group of musicians assembled for his use. While they are fine musicians, they are not an ensemble trained by and used to working with Walter. For that, turn to his recordings with the NY Philharmonic or the Vienna Philahramonic. These show how Walter COULD conduct Mahler. That said, the set shows us the pale shadow of a great conductor and, as such, these recordings are ones that should be heard and owned as no conductor today comes close.<br /><br />If you want a truly definitive set of the Mahler symphonies, get the Bernstein cycle with the NYPO but DO NOT get his later one using numerous orchestras. By this time Bernstein was more concerned with his ego than the composer, Mahler or anyone else.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|You must read this book. From the fast paced prologue, Game of Thrones, opens up into a diverse and amazing story of action, romance, politics and betrayal.<br /><br />Game of Thrones has a unique style to it. The story is not linear at all but rather the story is seen through the eyes of many different characters. Each with his/her own personality, trials and triumphs. Martin brings you into each one of these character's lives but only as you read further on do you really begin to know them truly. At times it can get confusing though, for each of these main characters also has his/her own story and people in their life that might not carry on from character to character. Others fill in through out the other characters. Needless to say, there is a lot going on so watch out. I had to go back and reread certain chapters to clarify what is happening. It is detail rich!<br /><br />With that said, look at a map. Westeros is a big world with lots of cities and lands and people.<br /><br />I do want to warn the future reader that this book contains a lot of adult situations. There is a lot of sex, references to it and detailed scenes as well as language. I did not want to take off a star for this because it is actually very well placed and not over done. I would even say it needs to be there for the story and characters to develop. If you are bothered by this then maybe this book would not be for you. If you can over look it, then this book will be worth every second spent reading it.<br /><br />*Edit 8/17/12*<br /><br />Well, I am almost done with he series now (just about to start the fifth book) and if I were to describe it in one word it would be committed. Game of Thrones is the toughest series I have ever read. At times (after book three) I was bored, I'll be honest, but other times I could not turn the pages fast enough. However, I still love the series! Hopefully books six and seven will be released soon.
0345803485|5.0|This 1st book is great.  You dont want to stop reading it because u want to find out what could possibly happen next.  I would definately recommend this book.  I actually read all 3 books in 3 weeks.  Can't wait for the movie.
B006UHZ7OQ|5.0|I purchased this vest for use on an expedition to the Galapagos Islands and Ecuador.  I carried a Nikon D300 with a Tamron 18-270MM Zoom on the primary carrier and a smaller Canon SX20iS on the secondary.  I have also used it with a Nikon 70-300 zoom.  Both cameras stayed in place boarding a Zodiac from the expedition ship and during both wet and dry landings on the islands.  It worked great allowing me hands free walking or scrambling over volcanic rock trails, up steep boardwalks and stairs.  Either camera was immediately available with just a 90 degree turn and lift.  It became automatic after the first few times.  Didn't ever have to think about it.  I returned with over 3000 photos so there was a lot of removal and replacement of the cameras.  I see absolutely no wear on the anchor system.  One disadvantage is the the anchor stud uses the tripod mount on the camera.  There is an adapter available that screws into the tripod mount and provides two mounts on the back side.  I mounted the anchor stud to one and my Manfrotto mount to the other.  This does result in the two being offset slightly from center but I did not find that to be a disadvantage once I got used to it.  It does result in the camera being slightly off center of the tripod/mono-pod center in use.  The adapter does cover most of the camera bottom so if you have a bottom door for battery or memory card, you must remove the adapter to access this door.  It removes with an Allen bolt that screws into the tripod mount.  Not difficult to deal with so long as you do not loose the Allen wrench.

0553573403|5.0|I cannot wait to read the book. The series is addictive and I cannot stop watching it. The acting is excellent and I appreciate that the characters are played by pro's who look fairly real as oppposed to the American TV norm of fake big breasts and super white teeth. I am at the scene where the little girl is practicing sword fighting and the Starks are about to be overun by their enemies. Whoever played that sword teacher was an excellent actor. He or whoever did the stunts made sword fighting beautiful. I also am enoumoured with the guy who plays the pretty long haired blonde dragon girls husband. Who is he??? I can't find much about him. He is so tough and strong, yet loving too. I am sorry I know this is a review of the HBO series but I just wanted to relate with people who love the story as much asI do and I know I will enjoy the books and am ordering all of them.  So this is sort of a preread review.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never read an erotic book before and did not know when I started reading this book that it was an erotic book. It took me by surprise. Even though I'm not really into erotic books I did like this book and the story line. I read a lot of other reviews on this book after I read it and I think it's one of those books that you either like or don't. I also think it's a good start for anyone who doesn't read erotic books but is interested.
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome sauce bets game ever also so addicting real fun trust me you wont reggret getting it cause its free
0439813786|5.0|My grandsons, ages 9, 11 and 13 love this book. They are in awe at all of the drawings by Brian Selznick. They were intrigued at the story. Can you believe this big book is a picture book, Awesome.
B000002PC6|4.0|With over 200 reviews to date, I'm sure I don't need to repeat the history of this career-generating milestone.<br />Suffice to say, PHYSICAL made a tremendous impact on eighties music. The single winding up the biggest song of the decade.<br />The album is pleasant Olivia stylings, her voice both soft and seductive in a collection of good pop material, mostly written by longtime producer John Farrar, with one tune, CARRIED AWAY, penned by Barry Gibb.  Olivia's self-composed THE PROMISE is beautiful, with a glorious vocal.<br />ONJ has become one of pop's most successful female vocalists and PHYSICAL is a prime example why.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|When will the release date be announced?!How many bonus features and extras and what are all of them going to be if any?!Will there be more than 4 discs?!What other freebees are to be included if any at all?!I hope there will be missing deleted scenes from ALL 4 movies,production/publicity photo-art galleries,premiere footage from when all 4 films opened for special advance celebrity screenings,behind-the-scenes-making-of footage to all 4,old and new interviews with the cast and crew,the ad campaign(posters,stills,lobby cards,etc-domestic and foreign),rejected concepts and ideas,test footage,screen tests,un-used production art,script changes,various movie trailers for theatres and for t.v.,how the visual effects and action scenes were done,everything should cover all 4 movies with a sneak surprize peak glimpse of the new forthcoming next \\"Indiana Jones 5\\" to come.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|While Meryl Streep deservedly won her third Oscar for her impressive performance as Margaret Thatcher, THE IRON LADY is a disappointing portrait of this historical figure.<br />The script focuses on Thatcher's seeming decline into probable dementia accompanied by hallucinatory conversations with her dead husband (a charming performance by Jim Broadbent) rather than illuminating Thatcher's key political crises.  This is all the more surprising since the director is a woman.<br />Streep is as expected amazing.  There are times it's hard to recognize the actress at all.  THE IRON LADY ultimately emerges as a vehicle for a brilliant performer in a flawed movie.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was uncertain about getting into this series, because I had heard many different stories about how badly it was written. I gave in and started reading the first book yesterday. It was not what everyone had said.<br />  I was completly enthralled in this series. I finished all three books in two days. The author has a way of making you want to keep reading and is't that what books are for? To keep you intertwined? The dictation in this book was also well written. There were some cheesy parts, but in the literary sense, the words used were appropriate.<br />It did have some similarities to Twilight, in the sense that the way both main male characters acted toward the leading lady in terms of romance and safety, but that was what I loved about Twilight (not the vampire stuff). The romance in this series was top notch. It will make a woman want a man like that.<br />  This series won my heart and though some the of love scenes were a tad bit unrealistic, I wasn't expecting this to be a biography. A girl can dream right?!<br />  i highly suggest this series to anyone who has an imagination and can enjoy some lite bondage!
0345803493|5.0|To be honest I didn't know all about the hype of the book. I just simply bought it because it was a best seller. The book is so different from the book I use to read. But Good different. I didn't expect the erotic part because I didn't even bother reading what is about and read the review. Its not saying I don't like the part but its my first reading this kind of book so its so new to me. It was well described and the story are very interesting. Theirs even a time where I would even I want my own christian grey lol.I can't get enough of the book that I also bought the other 2 books but for some reason I can't get enough that I was so sad when I finished the last book. *sigh*
B005NFJAT4|5.0|If you like facts about the Civil War you will like this movie. I learned even more about the plans each side for the battle that most history books don't tell you. It's an over 4 hour movie but worth your time.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|The Grey opens with Liam Neeson shooting a wolf. End of movie for me, but my husband challenged me to watch this nonsense to the bitter end. Apparently the Alaska oil rigs hire sharpshooters to kill wolves, which must unleash some truly bad karma on the blue collar men in this movie. Not to worry, these men deserve to die. Hollywood shows us these dregs of society in their last happy night on earth--after drilling for oil in the wilderness, they go carousing, drinking, fighting, cursing like sailors, I mean, er, oil-rig workers. Then these rowdies board the plane home and for some turbulent reason it crashes. No need to cry for them; they're oil rig workers, and their vocabulary is limited to 4-letter words. Well, except for Liam, of course, who can even recite a poem his dad wrote, something Hemingway-esque, nihilistic and macho. He can also play Mr. Sensitive and hold the hand of a dying man. Funny how this movie tries to give each scumbag a redeeming virtue or a tender moment before a wolf eats him.<br /><br />So Liam shot a wolf, then the plane crashed in the wilderness and most of the oil workers died. Some survived, even though hungry wolves kept trying to eat them, which is not normal wolf behavior. End of story? No such luck.<br /><br />The survivors feel lucky, maybe even chosen by God for a higher purpose, but then they keep dying one by one, and frankly it would have been better to die instantly in the crash. No explanation is given for all the wolves of Alaska to come snarling to the plane wreck, driving the survivors into the...forest?? Gosh, men are such idiots! And wolves are such crazed, wild, hungry predators! Nothing noble or beautiful about them, and no reason for Hollywood to make any attempt at portraying them naturally. Hey, National Geographic does that, right? So let's pretend wolves act like this, to make the movie really scary, and let's let some of the men show some humanity, so that viewers don't totally rejoice each time one dies. We haven't sunk to the level of The Hunger Games *yet* -- but this movie might help ease us into the idea that it's fun to watch people die in the wilderness. Especially when they're only guys.<br /><br />I detest male-bashing, especially in Disney cartoons aimed at kids--fathers are idiots, except Simba's dad, so he has to die in the most traumatizing way Disney can think of. Then again, if guys spend their hard earned money on movies like this, who am I to defend the male gender? Then again...when women waste money on chick flicks such as 27 Dresses, The Notebook, and other embarrassments, I can't defend my gender, either. Better to read a book, perhaps, but the book I'm in the midst of now is Neil Bartlett's translation of Moliere's Don Juan, and the whole human race is looking pretty stupid at the moment. Bring on the fairy tales! At least Moliere's males are witty and funny. Too bad Hollywood forgot how to write dialogue and create memorable characters. Let me know if something new and good comes to the big screen....en't sunk to the level of The Hunger Games *yet* -- but this movie might help ease us into the idea that it's fun to watch people die in the wilderness.

B007PS0X0W|1.0|The first Underworld was awesome, Evolution not too bad with some cool new twists, Rise of the Lycans was awesome and could have been really great had they done more with the werewolves. Awakening....Well....I could have been sleeping and got more entertainment. The lycans looked like Gumby in this one, there were no REAL fight scenes, it was slaughter or be slaughtered. I have seen better CGI visual effects in B-Movies, there were no REAL bad asses in this one and why not more Bryan instead of Chucky's big sister? I mean come on now nobody is really scared of a little girl who looks like a swoled up purple mini Hulk when she gets angry. This is BY FAR THE WORST OF ALL UNDERWORLDS. DO NOT WATCH IT. I will erase this movie from my memory just like I did with Terminator 3 Rise of the machines. Seriously though, they could have just asked ME to do this movie in my spare time after work and after playing with the kids, at least i would have spent more time on the visual effects. How lazy can you get? Visual effects through CGI are much less labor intensive and were once used for skimping on Special effects done with Pyrotechnics and extremely talented make-up artists and modelers. But no some how they have reached an all time laziness low with this clusterfail of a so called movie. Thanks for wasting my money...and my time with the back of my eyelids....;/  Going to sleep....NOW!
0446572993|1.0|I've read every book by Baldacci.  I've thoroughly enjoyed each and every one until this one came along.  Illogical statements, non sequitors, poor dialogues, and an almost unbelievable plot combine to make this book a real stinker.  The last 50 pages were actually painful to read. Come back, the real David Baldacci, wherever you are.
0446572993|5.0|This book was great as are all Baldacci's books.  I have read it twice since April 3 and will probably read it twice more until his next book comes out.  Can't wait.
0061537934|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Our family has owned dogs over many years and they become a part of your family.  I've always felt that our canine friends had the ability to understand (even though we're told they can't reason).  This book makes you look at your relationship with your dog in a way that nothing else can.  I have recommended this book to everyone I know, as it was a wonderful story mixed with humor and tears, loyalty,devotion and true companionship.  This book aptly confirms the saying that dogs are \\"Man's best friend.\\"

B002ZG994U|3.0|----------------------------------------<br />Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.<br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />***Brief Review***<br /><br />This film is definitely action packed and delivers some laughs.  But, are the characters as loveable as the ones from the tv series?  No.<br /><br />Story wise this is pretty simple, just like the tv series.  Soldiers framed for a crime they didn't commit, (Check), breaking out and try to prove their innocence, with guns, (Check).<br /><br />The biggest flaw (and strength) however is the action.  I mean come on, flying a tank?  I love outrageous action as much as the next guy, but leave a little believeably in there.<br /><br />Is this own-worthy?  Only if your a die-hard 'A-Team' fan.  Otherwise I would just wait for it to come on the channel 'FX'.<br /><br />Will there be sequel?  No.  I far as I know there is no plans for any sequel.  This appears to be a one shot deal.  Also I don't see all the actors coming back for a sequel anyway.  Also I think it was a box office flop, so to speak.<br /><br />If you are still interested.  Check the bargain bin at Wal-Mart or FYE, you may find this title for 5 bucks.  But pay no more for it.<br /><br />Hope this helps.  And remember 'Macguyver' is better than the 'A-Team' anyday...after all he NEVER had a gun and still was pretty bad-ass.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|A thoughtful, well-plotted SF masterpiece.  Howey has created an alt-future dystopia where humanity is reduced to living in ~50 self-contained underground bunkers, each unaware of the existence of the others.  Well worth reading, and I can't wait until the next installment.

078322947X|5.0|I have never seen a movie quite like Sorcerer, William Friedkin's fantastic story of four men challenged to deliver two truckloads of dynamite to a remote site in an unidentified South American country.  The dynamite is old, leaking, and volatile.  Any hard shaking will set it off.  Each box of the explosive is set in sand in the bed of each truck to keep it safe.  Unfortunately for the drivers of the trucks, the road to their destination is perilous.  Rocky roads, broken down bridges, impassable forests, are a few of the obstacles they must navigate, complicated by torrential rains that would make normal driving hazardous.<br /><br />Each of the truck drivers is running away from something that has gone bad in his native country.  I'll focus only on Roy Scheider, an Irish American gangster who has made the mistake of robbing the mafia in New York City.  The mafia don swears vengeance against the Irishman, which results in Roy's escape to South America.  A payment of $10,000. is enough incentive for Roy to attempt to deliver the dynamite to its destination.<br /><br />Scheider is an excellent actor, perhaps best known for his work in The French Connection and Jaws.  He is equally good in Sorcerer.  I marveled at the physical challenges of his role in this film.  Friedkin shows us every dangerous encounter the men faced on route to their destination, some of the most exciting scenes I have ever seen in the movies, and without help from computers!<br /><br />Any readers of this review will have to see for themselves what happens to the four men and their dangerous cargo.  Director Friedkin, of Exorcist fame, has outdone himself with this much less famous film.  He is master over the enormous challenges of bringing this perilous adventure to life.  Frankly, I was astonished by the realism of this film.  I can only imagine the impact created on a big screen with surround sound.<br /><br />Sorcerer is one good reason for going to the movies.  We are taken to a far away place and then put front and center into an adventure that often has us holding our breath as we sit on the edge of our seat wondering if the four men will escape one more time from dangers I have poorly described in this review - they must be seen to be believed.  Treat yourself to this well made adventure film; you won't be disappointed.lace and then put front and center into an adventure that often has us holding our breath as we sit on the edge of our seat wondering if the four men will escape one more time from dangers I have poorly described in this review - they must be seen to be believed.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so awesome! And I don't like using the word &quot;awesome&quot; cause I personally think its just cheesy but it is a must get! no joke.
B003A060K6|5.0|Was into some of Snaith's earlier 'Manitoba' stuff, but had sort of stopped following him, until he opened for Radiohead and totally rocked it, causing me to go back and revisit him again. Damn, 'Swim' is unreal. I can see why Thom Yorke is into this. Kudos to Dan Snaith for continuing to make incredibly good electronic music, and shame on me for stopping paying attention to him. Well, I'm back!! :)
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome!!!!!!! You should get this app!!!!! The app is exactly the same and twice the fun becuase of the bigger screen!!!!

B0012GMV4O|5.0|I've always' admired this album. There's just something about a terrific \\"song\\" which was overshadowed by a much more popular song that makes me appreciate it that much more. Let's face it, \\"Mississippi Queen\\" got most of the attention (and is still, to this day, a great song), but \\"Theme from an Imaginary Western,\\" IMHO, was the \\"star of the show.\\" The Eagles could have easily tucked this song away in their concept album, \\"Desperado,\\" but Pappalardi, West, Knight, Laing and Smart beat them to it. Simply a beautiful and compelling song depicting America's past.<br /><br />All-in-all, a watershed album by a tremendous group. It served as a catalyst for many other fine bands who followed in Mountain's footsteps.<br /><br />*BTW: Felix's wife, who would later become the source of his demise, absolutely nailed the album cover artwork.

145387318X|2.0|The original book was a classic, an excellent story that just made you feel good to read it. It's one of my favorite books and always lifts my spirits to read it.<br /><br />The first third of this book follows in that suit. It's not quite as good as the original, but it's still pretty good, and fun to read.<br /><br />Then suddenly, inexplicably, the author jumps the story ahead by 6 or 7 years. The problems the characters have to deal with are EXTREMELY contrived and really don't make much sense, and the characters are written to be very stupid people who cannot solve simple problems. Their personalities even change, and it seems like this part was written by a completely different author who has no talent at all. It's some seriously bad writing and it's sad that it exists in a sequel to such a great original book.<br /><br />The only redeeming thing about it, is that it satisfied my curiosity to see what Pollyanna would be like when she's a mature adult instead of a happy go lucky child who speaks first and thinks later. Unfortunately, it turns out she becomes a half-wit who can't help anyone. Too bad.<br /><br />You might read this out of curiosity... but don't expect much compared to the original.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Deleted this from my Kindle account. Not good writing just boring, repetitive porn. How could this book become such a sensation? Don't waste your time or money.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is so contagious i have read it in two days. I can't wait to read the third one. Something not expected happens in every chapter, and once you get your hands in this book, you won't want to put it away.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Fun puzzles, challenging, with clear hints when you inevitably get stuck.  Excellent game to pass time.  If you like puzzles and adventures without the annoying &quot;find all these objects in this picture&quot; search games, give it a try.
B005HSL626|4.0|I play this game all the time it is a really good app. I love getting to get all the new swords and backgrounds and really think you would get this app. way funnn!!!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|First listen I only attached to a few songs.  Second and third listens turned into more and more listens.  Pop music these days hasn't been very good so I was skeptical (yes even skeptical of Adam) about this record.  I am SO glad I bought it!  I have a CD for my computer and for my car and put the tracks on my phone so I can take Adam everywhere!  It's dark, sexy, emotional, frustrating....I can relate to pretty much all of the songs.  It's really nice when an artist can put out some songs that have the same issues you are going through!  So this album helps me a lot.  Can't wait for his concert of these songs!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I don't normally watch tv, but when someone got me to watch this, I was hooked. I cant even describe how amazing this show is. Ive been impaciently waiting for season 4 for a month now! SO EXCITED!

B001GCUO4S|5.0|A new twist on an established franchise, fresh and unexpected. Excellent cast and lots of action, it kept my interest from start to finish. Bobby Campo is outstanding and it will be fascinating to watch his career bloom.
B0086700CM|5.0|the game is just epic in my honest opinion. I reckmend that each if my many friends purchases the game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it its different<br /><br />hope it doest ever stop in levels wish it had more free acorns though. courios if there will be game updates or patches?
B0086700CM|3.0|ive played this game many times on iphones and ipods, and ive had no problems and have really enjoyed the game. but on kindle, it lags a ton and is extremely difficult to play, especially off of wifi. they need to fix this.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is the best game ever invented for Kindle Fire. If anyone knows anymore games that are similar to this, please comment/email me (riana3388@gmail.com). :)
B0086700CM|5.0|The market for the Kindle Fire is very limited at best. The addition of Temple Run is a very nice deal breaker over the nook. Thank you Imangi Studios!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book is entertaining but certainly not amazing.  Not a whole lot of substance.  I finished the book and will probably move on to the 2nd book eventually only to see what caused Christian Grey to be the man that he is.  It is very erotic in a strange way.  Not a lifestyle I would entertain but it seems to have Anastatia hooked to a certain degree.  In reality I feel this would really mess someone up though.  She was a virgin and he was her first love.  I certainly hope book 2 and 3 go somewhere if I decide to read them.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this plus my son love ice age can wait for the new movie to come out!! yahoo every one
0812979702|5.0|Golf is such a mental game and this book really helps you improve this portion of your game. He has some great examples and has a great common sense perspective to the game of golf.

B000KN7BOA|3.0|This is an early Bee Gees release. I expected an audio cd, but this is mp3 type files that my win 7 pc would not read, let alone play. I had to transfer the files to .wav type on my old xp machine and burn them to disc so they would be playable anywhere. The music is good, some songs stick in your head forever. It should have been formatted differently however.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is really fun. make sure you jump,slide,&amp; duck for safety.my grandma beat this game already she finished really quick.when she got the phone that was the first app she downloaded.so now you know it has to be fun

B0077PBPJ6|1.0|I think they were going for the \\"Downton Abbey\\" thing but totally failed.  You can't really relate to any of these characters, nor feel sorry for them and you certainly can't admire any one of them - except maybe for those poor soldiers who bought the bullets needlessly.  It would probably have been better to hear their stories than the shallow one of the French romance theme.  The lead is an empty headed soul with no moral compass and no leadership skills - how an orphan manages to appear to have the money he has and the ability to schmooze with the rich wasn't made clear.  The young cad cheats with the wife of the man supposedly his mentor in France.  There really seems no reason for their romance other than sex which the cameras kept on showing without any \\"real love\\" between any of the characters.  The French wife herself has no redeeming features and appears so vaccuous it was almost funny(except they try to humanize her by having her feed the poor while meanwhile cheating on her husband!). The husband is the classical \\"cruel master\\" so of course it makes the cheating acceptable.  The grunt soldiers are the only ones worth watching and we are never made privy into their stories very much at all.  I borrowed this from the library and kept fast forwarding in the vain hope the story line would get better!  It didn't!!

B005LAIGWS|3.0|I want to start by saying that like others I dislike the idea of the Ultraviolet digital copy, but that shouldn't be a reason to rate the actual movie one way or another, it would be like giving a one star review because you didn't like the cover art!.<br />Now to the film, I saw this in HDX on VUDU, and enjoyed it...to a point.<br />It's a complete change in direction from the first film, doesn't seem to follow on at all, and even the garbled comic book intro doesn't really resemble the events of the first movie.<br />It's done in a different style for sure, that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it does have a rock video, muddled feel.<br />Budget constraints obviously were in the driving seat, compared to the acting in the first movie, this is definitely worse, even Cage looks tired and bored most of the time, delivering lines as if they were on cue cards.<br />The story is laughably stupid and predictable, and any actors of note who appear tend to plod through the thin script.<br />All that said it has a ridiculous charm, this time out the Ghost Rider is much more of a diabolical maniac, and the transformation scenes with Cage trying to hold the beast back are a good laugh.<br />Quite a bit of action, some very good special effects, especially on the VMax bike they used will please fans of the genre, and I suspect the choppy camera work, flicking in and out of black screen, and slow motion make it look and feel like a comic book storyboard.<br />Locations for shooting are all Eastern Europe, again obviously driven by a small budget, and although the special effects are good, the whole thing is a bit ridiculous.<br />I enjoyed it as a stand alone movie, without the depth or story of the first movie for sure, but eye candy nonetheless.<br />When I first saw the trailer for this last year, I had expected a big budget sequel, and I didn't actually see or here of a theatrical release, which after seeing what's on display might explain the straight to DVD production feel.<br />3 stars, if you like this kind of stuff, it will generate a couple of hours of harmless fun, if you're looking for a meaningful sequel, don't bother.feel.<br />3 stars, if you like this kind of stuff, it will generate a couple of hours of harmless fun, if you're looking for a meaningful sequel, don't bother.

Not only is this case stylish, it protects it too!! The otter box is too bulky for me, this one is sleek and nice looking. It slides in and out of my pocket much easier than any other case. The lifeproof case website suggests you do an hour long test submerging the case in water for one hour prior to putting your iPhone in the case. I did this and haven't had any problems with leaking. I recommend this case to anyone that wants to protect their phone and keep the nice look that the iPhone offers as well.

0345803485|1.0|When Naked Came the Stranger, Candy, and other funny soft porn books came out in the 60s, everyone howled at the cleverness and sharp writing that made them such fun. Also, books like Delta of Venus by Anais Nin revealed the art of good erotic writing when it works. In her case, she claims to have generated those pages for a small fee from a single client. Considering she was the lover of Henry Miller, well you get the idea, she knew what she was writing about.<br /><br />This recent stuff is comparatively so boring and unimaginative, I shudder to think millions are flowing into the pocket of the writer, who doesn't deserve the notoriety or audience. Boo to the book critics, the public, and shamelessness of the publisher. And boo to you if you waste your money and mind on this low level stuff.

0930289234|4.0|I read this series when it first came out in the 80's.  I didn't get it then, likely because I was too young.  I recently reread it, and enjoy it much more than I did when it first came out, but still am not completely on the Watchmen bandwagon.  The art is pretty generic, and I think detracts from the story.  A grittier, darker artist would have been better than Gibbons, IMHO.  Not a big fan of the big octopus as well.  Glad the movie took it out.<br />Maybe I'm just a superhero nerd.  I recently also reread [[ASIN:1563897504 Crisis On Infinite Earths]] and really enjoyed it.<br />As an aside, I did really enjoy the Watchmen movie, which was panned by so many.

0723257639|5.0|I have always wanted a full collection of the Beatrix Potter books in a set, with each book separate. This is a gorgeous version. The books are all hardback, and a small size, and the box is in a elegant white design. Each book is numbered, and has the original illustrations in colour. Beatrix Potter's stories are timeless and a must-have for any fans of classic children's tales. A great one to have on the shelf.<br /><br />The seller was also fantastic to deal with - when it arrived, I noticed 1 of the books was missing from my set and instead there were 2 copies of another one of the books. I sent them an email immediately, they replied that day and promptly sent out a copy of the missing book, very well wrapped and packaged, no questions asked. Thankyou!
0723244502|5.0|The book arrived on my doorstep pristine and much sooner than I expected. I grew up watching Beatrix Potter's cartoons on tv and reading her stories, and in this book they are presented exactly as I hoped for. The illustrations are full-colour and vibrant, and there are 4 extra stories at the end previously unpublished. I love being able to relive them now as an adult and fully appreciate their charm.
B004RLPWXS|5.0|The thirteenth studio album by Duran Duran does not disappoint.  The lineup for this album includes most original members except for Andy Taylor; the majority of the guitar work being performed now by Dom Brown -who does a great job. (And I have to squeeze in that Nick Rhodes continues to create some of the greatest synth music of all time.)<br /><br />The album was wonderfully produced by Grammy Award-winner Mark Ronson, who I feel truly produced this album as a fan, not a \\"let me take you somewhere else\\" type of producer.  This is a very well done and very clean album and in my opinion is Ronson's best production work since his 2008 work on Adele's album \\"19\\".<br /><br />Duran Duran are in TOP form and are way past phrases like \\"still have it\\" both in composition and musicianship.  This album has all of the excitement of a new band sporting a hard earned debut album - It's that GOOD! The boys in DD, definitely followed their recipe for solid 80's synth-pop.  In my opinion they also did their homework.  \\"All You Need is Now\\", definitely pays homage not only to DD album favorites like \\"Rio\\" but also embrace somewhat obscure 80's synth-pop artist like Solitaire \\"[[ASIN:B0037J984K Best Of: 83-86]]\\" (whose works can be found here on Amazon).  Listen closely to the lyrics in DD's \\"Blame the Machines\\".  At first I thought the \\"on and on ...\\" lyrics were sampled from Solitaire's [[ASIN:B0037JB38Y This Nightmare Don't Ever Sleep]] (although upon closer review you can tell it's the \\"style\\" - not a sample). Also conceptually \\"Blame the Machines\\" has a very close sense of automaton angst and awe as Solitaire's [[ASIN:B0037JH95A System Overload]].<br /><br />But don't get me wrong these are fresh original works that pay homage to 80's synth, DD's roots while at the same time take the almost lost art of synth pop to new exciting heights. If I had to limit my collection to only one Duran Duran album - I'd pick this one.  All You Need is Duran Duran!

B007ZKY7XO|4.0|Scissor Sister's have released their fourth album.  It's Magic Hour, which the title of the album reminds me of the title of \\"ta-dah\\" their second album.  After The Sisters released Night Work, their best album and best kept secret,releasing singles that did not represent the album very well kind of sank their UK market which their biggest fans lived.  After the music media ignored one of the best albums of all time, personally believe Scissor Sisters figure they should try to seem a little more modern or pop, where as the last album was purely from a early 1980's club vibe that had a continual theme.  This album is all over the place Which Jake Shears, the lead singer, has stated.  The album isn't bad but there are songs that really miss the mark.  Ironically, in 2010 Scissor Sisters stated they shelved an album for the reason that it was all over the place.<br /><br />The beginning of the album is pretty good.  The album highlights are Baby Come Home, Inevitable, and Let's Have a Kiki.  Baby comes home and Inevitable are purely Scissor sisters fashion.  Let's have a Kiki, reminds me of Maxi singles from the late 80's.  Great beat and pretty funny.  Ana does a great job on this song.  Some other songs that are great but on a lesser extent are \\"keep Your Shoes on\\", \\"Year of living Dangerously\\", \\"Only the Horses\\", \\"Shady Love\\",\\"San Luis Obispo\\", and \\"Somewhere\\" which feels like a Night Work song.  The misses are three in a row which really hurts the flow of the album, starting with free-style \\"Self Control\\" then very pop radio candy that will not test well with test of time with \\"best in Me', and then followed by a ballad that comes off flat \\"Secret Life of letters.\\"  This seriously hurt the album in my mind.  If they cut those songs and added \\"F*** Yeah\\", remix version, after Shady Love and recorded another song or two that was true to their style the album would have been better.<br /><br />Scissor Sisters almost had a theme going with late 1980s with Let's have akiki, year of living dangerously, and freestyle-eque \\"self control\\".  But the other songs are totally not late 80's.  The other theme was modern pop.  Scissor Sisters tried UK pop with Only the horses, and USA pop with \\"Shady Love\\".  The songs are both very different, but both popular music, although different, in both of these countries USA & UK.  As a results, you get a Magic Hour grab bag.  Pretty good album but it's all over the place and there are some songs that should have been cut off of the drawing table or a b-side.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|As the title says it does its job but it is not what i expected. It feels and looks very cheap and poorly made. My Kindle Fire fits it perfectly, the stand works without problem.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I started to read this book I set my other books aside.  This book captivated me from start to finish and couldn't wait to purchase the second book in the series.  And if this book goes the way I'm thinking, I will purchase the third book in the trilogy. Just a little caution, though, it is very steamy and graphic.  It is a love/hate relationship with both characters (Anastasia and Christian Grey).  The power stuggle between the two is like a tug of war of will power and lust.  But you will read on because the fantasy of it is mind-blowing.  You'll wake up in the middle of the night in a warm sweat and wishing to go back to sleep to continue the wet dream you were having.

0345803485|1.0|I cannot believe this book is a best seller.  I could hardly get past chapter 7 of the first book before I decided to put it down ... for good.  This book was poorly written by someone claiming to be an adult.  (I seriously thought it was written by a teenage girl...it was that bad).<br />The main character, Ana, is supposedly 21 years old...and still a vigin (yeah, right).  The leading male, Christian, a self made billionaire at the age of 26...are you kidding me?  Oh and of course, he's devilishly handsome!  There is absolutely no depth to these characters, and Ana's 'inner goddess' is quite annoying, and talks too much.<br />I wasted $32.00 on all three of these Kindle books because it had a 4 star rating.  I can't get that money back, and I have no desire to even begin to finish the first one, let alone read all three.  I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing these.  Hopefully this will deter others from wasting their money as well.

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Well, it's finally here.  Many of us have been waiting for this moment for years, some for even decades.  But despite the bumps along the ways, and fears that we may never see its realization, us fans finally have what we have wanted for so long.  I'm talking, of course, about Joss Whedon's first time helming an existing property in a major motion picture.  As much as Whedon fans have enjoyed his original work over the years, many of us have wondered what he could do not only with preexisting characters but also with the backing of a major budget and the epic panoramic screen of the multiplex.  Oh, and of course the film itself happens to be The Avengers, the most anticipated movie of the last ten years or so.  And I'm happy to report that no one other than Whedon would have been able to pull off a film with this scope and this huge cast of characters.<br /><br /> As you might guess, this review will be Whedon centric.  Plenty of people have dissected The Avengers from the point of view of comic book fans or critics of summer blockbusters.  But I would like to approach it from the perspective of one entry within Whedon's larger oeuvre.  I have a long history with Whedon's work, starting in high school when I first started watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer on a lark.  The concept of transforming a poorly received film into an ongoing series appeared to be such an idiotic idea that I decided to tune in order to witness some schadenfreude.  But eventually I found myself sucked into the story of a group of teenagers struggling simultaneously with adolescents and the supernatural, both elements of the show serving as metaphor for the other.  Not only did Buffy provide a surprisingly accurate view of growing up, but it also dipped into narrative experimentation.  Like many TV shows from the 90s, Buffy was acutely aware of genre conventions and subverted them whenever it could.  From then on I was a devoted fan of Whedon's work, from his spin off series Angel to the cult classic Firefly to his work in comic books.<br /><br /> And of all the elements Whedon is most known for, the one that makes him most suited for an Avengers film is his ability to handle a large cast of characters without letting anyone slide into the background.  Whedon once said that he had to add more characters to Angel because he had such a difficult time writing for just the three principle actors.  It's also not uncommon for ancillary characters to become series regulars in his shows.  So if anyone is capable of balancing out four superheroes who had previously anchored their own films along with a good helping of backup characters, it is Joss Whedon.  The Avengers combines elements from many of the previous films.  The Iron Man movies initially introduced the idea of \\"The Avengers Initiative,\\" first in a post-credit scene from the first film and later in the sequel SHIELD and the Avengers served as an entire subplot that nearly derailed the movie.  The MacGuffin, here known as the tesseract, was first introduced in Captain America and has a connection to the Norse Gods that filled out the mythology of Thor.  And the main villain, Loki, is of course the adopted brother of Thor himself.  Of all the previous Marvel movies, The Incredible Hulk is the least essential.  But with a new casting (Mark Ruffalo replaces Edward Norton) audiences have an opportunity to become reacquainted with the green guy.<br /><br /> The basic plot of the film is relatively straight forward with only a few curves thrown in for good measure.  Loki wants to steal the tesseract so that he can lead an invading alien force that will take over the Earth.  Without too much plot to get in the way, Whedon is capable of focusing his energy on the story's core pith: the friction between the heroes.  A lot of the film's drama comes from the fact that these characters don't belong together.  Their personalities and ideologies just don't fit.  In most comic books this means that the heroes have to fight before they team up, and in true comic book form when Thor tries to extract Loki from SHIELD custody and take him back to Asgardian jurisdiction Captain America and Iron Man team up to stop him.  Likewise, Captain America, who is a man out of time, continually brushes up against Tony Stark.  This makes sense, since Steve Rogers is a veteran of World War II when it was necessary for the individuals to sacrifice himself for the greater good, but, as Iron Man, Tony Stark doesn't do anything without first considering his own ego.  And in the midst of all this tension lies Bruce Banner who is liable to Hulk out at any provocation.<br /><br /> Whedon is able to steer the film towards the interpersonal thanks to a few tricks he learned back in his Buffy days.  In the episode, \\"The Yoko Factor,\\" the gang captures the punk rock vampire Spike only for him to psychologically manipulate each of Buffy's friends in order to get them to turn on one another.  The point of the episode is that these tensions have existed for some time, and it only took a little spark for all of the resentment between friends to ignite into hatred.  Similarly, in The Avengers, Shield manages to capture Loki who then proceeds to sew seeds of distrust among the newly formed super group.  By making the tensions between the Avengers a weakness the villain can exploit, Whedon is able to clearly illustrate these characters for the audience while keeping the plot moving along.  The story doesn't need to stop in order for us to get to know these characters.<br /><br /> If Whedon is known for one authorial tick, then it is probably his use of witticisms and word play.  The team dynamic allows him plenty of space to incorporate some of his well known dialogue.  The film trades in lots of quips between heroes and has a sprinkling of snark without going overboard.  Critics of Whedon's writing find his dialogue to be treacly rather than charming, and while I mostly disagree with these critics, it's certainlytrue that not all of Whedon's verbal jabs land properly.  This is especially true when Whedon isn't present to carefully direct his dialogue's delivery (see Halle Berry in The X-Men).  But like an athlete who does his best work in front of millions, here, when the world is watching, Whedon's humor absolutely shines.  And he has found a great ally in Robert Downey Jr. who is known to insist on making his own improvements on his scripts (the \\"Shwarma\\" joke was apparently all his idea).  In fact, Whedon is confident enough in his humor to momentarily take a break from the action to show us a Shield agent playing Galaga on a multimillion dollar computer when his boss isn't watching.  A joke that wouldn't work if he didn't trust that his audience shared his own bizarre sense of humor.<br /><br /> In addition to his use of repartee, Whedon's also well known as a pop culture feminist, which in practice means he likes to watch an attractive lady beat up guys much bigger than herself.  Here Black Widow (played by Scarlett Johansson) serves this particular purpose.  Several times throughout the film, Black Widow uses others' perception of her as an emotionally fragile creature in order to, jujitsu-like, convince her enemies to spill important information.  What might be first seen as a weakness becomes a weapon.  Whedon is clearly within the ideological confines of third-wave feminism, which seems to maintain that women can both serve as sexual objects while simultaneously kicking ass.  And there's some legitimate criticism to this approach to feminism, but Whedon generally gets away with it because he's able to write strong, interesting female characters.  We learn that Black Widow has a history with another SHIELD agent, Hawkeye (played by Jeremy Renner and, unfortunately, not given much of a role).  And when he is taken by Loki, Black Widow, in a role reversal, is allowed to become his savior.  Third wave feminism suits Johansson, an actress who most directors seem unableto do anything interesting with.  Arguably, this is her best role since Lost in Translation.<br /><br /> But if there is a single major theme of The Avengers, then it is the question of the place of the individual within a larger community.  While making a pit stop in Germany, Loki takes the time to make a crowd of people bow before him while he pontificates on the useless notion of freedom.  And if the parallels between Loki's philosophy and fascism aren't clear enough, an older gentleman in the crowd decides to stand up and all but call Loki Hitler (obviously this fellow has never heard of Godwin's Law).  But the Avengers have their own problems formulating a cohesive group.  Each character is in some manner or other cut off from the larger society, whether it is Bruce Banner's rage or Tony Stark's ego.  These are individuals who are marked as outsiders, a favorite theme of Whedon's work.  But their very survival, and the survival of the world, is dependant on the ability of these individual parts to interlock.  Whedon represents the eventual coming together of these heroes in the final battle with a single shot that moves around the city in order to let the audience see how these characters work together as a cohesive unit.  For Whedon the answer to forced unity is not pure individuality, but rather a volatile mixture of the singular within the communal.<br /><br /> But Whedon hasn't lost his healthy distrust of governing bodies.  Without giving too much away, in addition to dealing with an alien invasions, the film's heroes must also contend with the unclear motives of SHIELD, the quasi-military/quasi-intelligence agency that first assembled the Avengers.  Not only do members of the Avengers accuse SHIELD of attempting to create weapons of mass destruction, but the organization also purposefully attacks a civilian target for the \\"greater good.\\"  In fact, Whedon's portrayal of SHIELD may have been too subversive for the U.S. military who cited its portrayals as areason why they refused to cooperate with the movie by lending military equipment, an offer they regularly extend to films that represent the armed forces in a much more \\"patriotic\\" light.<br /><br /> For the most part the movies produced by Marvel have been, by necessity, studio films in the classic Hollywood tradition.  Superhero movies have become so popular that most studios have banished any ultra stylistic auteurs who, early on in the superhero craze, put out some of the more distinctive films in the genre.  The likes of Ang Lee and Sam Raimi were deemed too idiosyncratic to helm multi-million dollar films.  That doesn't mean that there haven't been some interesting superhero films in the last few years, but it does mean that singular visions have been replaced by the work of handy craftsmen.  When you watch Tim Burton's Batman, you immediately recognize that this can be nothing but the work of Tim Burton The same could be said about Nolan's Batman series, thanks to the fact that they were first made when superhero auteurs were still in vogue.  (It's unlikely in today's environment that the studio would give Nolan as much free reign as he wielded).  Joss Whedon's The Avengers (a title that would make more sense than Marvel's The Avengers) attempts to derail this trend.  While Whedon is still constrained by the visual and narrative template established previously in earlier Marvel movies, he still manages to create a film that speaks with his own artistic voice.  This is especially impressive when you consider the fact that he was entrusted with an astronomical budget.  Maybe from within the deafening confines of the studio system, a singular voice can make itself heard after all.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found myself thoroughly entertained by this book.  Exciting, original and interesting!  I had a very hard time putting it down.  I bought it yesterday and finished it today.  I'm starting part six as soon as I finish this review.<br /><br />An added bonus:  It was well edited.  Thank you for that, Mr. Howey!  Too many self-published books have potential, but the poor editing makes them painful to read.<br /><br />Believe all the five star ratings, I'm glad I did.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Luv this series!! Sexy & romantic... Easy to read and great details especially in the erotic scenes! Gives u some ideas too :-)

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it for it's entertainment value. Considering all the crap that's on TV and in the theaters, this trilogy is quality. The characters had depth. The story line was compelling. The first two books would have benefited from a more experienced editor but the third book really was top notch.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I watched it for the fourth time yesterday in theaters on 3D and damn...I love this film to bits and it just keeps getting better with each subsequent viewing. It is hands down the best experience I've had at the theater in years.<br /><br />Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Loki, Fury, Hill, Widow, Hawkeye, Coulson, etc; having all these larger than life characters in a single movie can be a daunting task and could have gone wrong rather easily. But the film manages to make it work perfectly by balancing all the characters so that none of them feel like filler or as being disregarded due to undue attention being given to other characters. All are presented and introduced well, have their chance to shine and to show us about themselves and they all ad something of substance to the film. From Maria Hill to Nick Fury to Thor and Iron man, each one of them has their moment in the film and are portrayed in such a way that the audience can relate to them.<br /><br />While the story is indeed simple, to critique the film on this aspect is to miss the point as the purpose of the story is to get everyone together to fight a common goal, which is the driving idea behind the Avengers initiative. On that count, the story works wonderfully and the drama and tension is rather created by the characters who are the focus and forte of the film. Their interaction, chemistry and motivations are what drive the film and draws you in. They are all drawn and presented so well that you end up loving and actually caring for these characters and like a good friend whose company you enjoy, you just want to see them again and again, something which plays into the replay value of the film, which to my mind is incredibly high.<br /><br />For a film that depends so much on it's characters, it is essential that the actors portraying them do a good job and on this front the movie excels as well. Everyone brought their A-Game to the film and did a wonderful work with their respective characters. Robert was great as usual as Tony stark and Ruffalo with his very nuanced performance is hand down the best Banner/Hulk to ever grace a film. His chemistry with Robert in their scenes on the Helicarrier was amazing as well. Hiddleston shows an incredible range on his portrayal of Loki, most noticeably in his scenes with Thor in the mountains (Hemsworth is also great here) and with Black Widow when he is captured in the Helicarrier. Scarlett in particular surprised me, after a bit of a one note performance in Iron Man 2, she brings more depth and a more human side to her character in this film; specially in her scenes with Banner/Hulk, where we see her show a fearful/vulnerable side of her character. Jeremy is always great and this doesn't changes with his portrayal of Hawkeye as was Jackson with Nick Fury. All in all, everyone did great in terms of acting in this film.<br /><br />The heroes in particular, whom we first met in their respective solo films, are shown here to have evolved since we last met them. From Captain America's feelings as being a man out of time who is trying to find his own purpose in this new world he just woke up in, to Thor's more mature albeit still conflicted nature due to his love for Loki, to a Loki who is confident, more menacing and determined than the confused Loki we left in Thor, to Tony Stark who is now in the clean energy business and is more than meets the eye to a Banner who is now in control of his \\"other guy\\" but who wonders why he survived the incident, all the heroes show more depth and complexity than they did in the previous films. You add to this the humanity of Black Widow, Fury, Hill, Coulson and Hawkeye and you have an incredible rich and wide palette of texture within the film; and like a great painting, it is all balanced out perfectly.<br /><br />This great balance between the characters that the film achieves is seen as well in it's action sequences. The film has two big action scenes, the one in the Helicarrier and the other inthe City, and in both we can see all the heroes jumping into the action and even achieving something worthwhile. The action sequences are also very well choreographed and edited, with none of the mindless, fast cut editing or excessive slow-motion cliché that is so common in many of today's films. You can easily follow and keep track of what's going on during each scene. One of my favorite parts is the virtuoso sequence during the final act where the camera continuously follows the action from one Avenger to the next, starting with Black Widow, then following Iron Man who joins up Captain America, then Iron Man passing through Hawkeye whose arrow then the camera follows to where Thor and Hulk are fighting. It truly shows how all of them are working together, fulfilling their respective roles as The Avengers.<br /><br />The script of the film is fantastic as is the dialog and along with the film's pacing very tight. All scenes have a purpose and feel like mini pieces that could stand on their own, specially the ones during the first part of the film where each of the heroes is being introduced. The scenes lead beautifully to one another tied in by the dialog and at no point does one feels like the film is dragging or that some particular scene is filler.<br /><br />The Avengers has it all, the film manages to provide an amazing mix of action, humor and drama that keeps you glued to the screen from beginning to end and when the film ends, you just feel like watching it all over again.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is very fun I advise u to get this app.I like it my mom and dad even like it

0140143505|5.0|Once in awhile I'll be so captivated by a non-fiction book that I want to know more about the author or people in the story. One example was Helene Hanff and her marvelous story about her multi-decade correspondence with a bookshop in England, 84 Charing Cross Road (and there is a film version of it too!). Basically, this is a collection of letters that the author wrote to a bookshop in London ... over the course of several decades. The bookshop helped to feed her reading habit, and the unusual correspondence cemented a unique bond between the two parties. The book starts off a bit slow, but very quickly you'll become engrossed in this wonderful postal relationship. Funny and moving.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game and am so glad that they made it for the kindle fire and glad that it works
B005N95JA4|3.0|I have always thought that \\"Some Girls\\" was the most overrated Rolling Stones album. It was interesting when it came out, perhaps something a bit different for the times. But you can't compare it to truly great albums like \\"Let it Bleed\\", \\"Exile on Main Street\\" or \\"Sticky Fingers.\\" Sorry, but \\"Some Girls is not nearly in the same class. But hey, I wanted to relive the late 70s and hadn't heard this album in years, so with the addition of the extra tracks on Disc 2, I thought I'd get this one again. I'm still not overly impressed with the regular album; some great tricks amidst some filler and novelty tunes. But the real surprise here is the high quality of the unreleased tracks on Disc 2. Honestly, I think this would make a better album than the original \\"Some Girls.\\" It may not sound as cohesive in an album context, but the overall quality is very good, ranging from traditional Stones-styled rockers to more blues influenced tunes. It starts off with the brilliant \\"Claudine,\\" a song that makes my smile every time. Outrageous lyrics and a great rockin' arrangement. Another one of my new favorites is the uptempo \\"I Love You Too Much.\\" Jagger really rips into that one. Even Keith singing a cover of \\"We Had it All\\" is pretty darn good, not nearly as cheesy as you'd expect. Big thumbs up for these extra tracks. A pleasure to hear some more vintage Stones tracks that are this good.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have this game on my iphone and ipod touch I just love it I am so glad it is on the Kidle fire omg I love this game I so crazzy for it

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so goooood! on other devices I would have to barrow my friends but now I can get it on my own kindle fire! this ia so great....
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book shares with us what we all didn't know - the truly scary side of war where just a handful of men are asked to do the unthinkable in unimaginable situations. I am amazed we have these kinds of men still around who do this for the rest of us who sit and home and take for granted all the freedoms they help preserve for us. Marcus and his friends are just one group of thousands who do this every day. The book will have you skipping meals to read what happens next and losing sleep thinking about our fine military soldiers and what we ask them to do, but that's just a small price we must pay to make sure that these stories are told and these unsung hero's are treated well on and off the battlefield.<br /><br />The writing was straightforward, but exciting which is refreshing when reading non-fiction. I only wish I knew more about the other families and what happened to them during the time their loved ones were missing and what happened afterwards. Lone Survivor - the Aftermath? Sequel? Would definitely read it!!
0439023521|5.0|I have just finished reading all three hunger games, but would have to say the first book was my favorite. It is a captivating, thrilling adventure from the get go. Suzanne Collins tugs at your emotions as she pulls you into every twist and turn you take with Katniss Everdeen. I think the first book in The Hunger Games Trilogy makes you connect most with the characters as you learn most about who they are and where they come from before entering the battle field. I almost felt like I was part of the capitol as I watched the games unfold and cheer on those you wanted to survive and others you wanted to die in the games. The combination of love, power, and survival brings together a remarkable piece of literature that has clearly captivated thousands of readers. I strongly suggest reading all of The Hunger Games books. Get ready for the roller coaster of a ride you will be taken on through each one.
B001EAWMFQ|1.0|I bought the product but I was surprised that the movie is not in japanese as it was said in the description. It's English dubbed ... and it's the only language available....
B0086700CM|4.0|I love temple run..However every once in a while it will have a couple minor issues ...but besides that it is a great and addictive game.
B00845PT18|5.0|Ignore the naysayers, in fact, I invite them to re-watch the movie with a few points in mind (spoilers, below).<br /><br />Don't expect brilliance, it's a fairly linear plot, delivered in a somewhat campy way with your typical pacing issues, as a bonus it's pretty clear the cast generally had quite a bit of fun making the movie.<br /><br />In particular, the Ghost Rider was excellent in CGI-mode, there were some clever twists added that made him feel like his own character and added quite a bit of life.  There were also some subtleties that were probably missed easily that I caught after a second run-through.<br /><br />Also. . . the classic Nic Cage crazy, not only does it work, but it BELONGS.  The problem with the movie is they don't tell you why until it's almost over, and most reviewers make up their mind long before then.<br /><br />If you want to have your intellect challenged, read a book.  Movies aren't good for that.  If you want some fun emotions and a great ride, then this is far better than most higher ranked movies.<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br /><br />There are three entities, not two.  As it's revealed later in the movie the Ghost Rider is the Angel of Justice, trapped, driven insane, and turned into the Ghost Rider.  If you go back to the 'over the top' Nic Cage crazy moments, you'll notice that they're happening when he's doing something genuinely good and fighting the Ghost Rider.  So, Apparently 'Angel of Justice Driven insane'='Nic Cage Crazy'.  That makes the scene with the informant make a lot more sense.<br /><br />I LOVE that the Ghost is . . .a somewhat insane Ghost. I gather that it's weakness is simply focus, when it doesn't see anything that's either a needed vehicle or a nice tasty bunch of evil goodness in human form, it gets bored and leaves a sore Mr. Blaze.  The first scene nicely made him 'alien', with his movements and the way he seems to sense more than anything.  The scene at the construction yard makes this nice and blatant, and shows he doesn't obey the same physical laws.  I think also the 'weakening when there's no Yummy Evilbites to see' explains that bit at the end where he blacked out briefly when fighting Carrigan (especially with his two powers of decay AND darkness).<br /><br />The bit where Danny does his own contract with the fire breathing was absolutely awesomely done.  If somehow the had a six year old girl in pigtails. . then that moment would have been iconic.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed this series for what it was: a story of romance & redemption (with a little steam). Those who didn't enjoy it because it wasn't written to their elite standards should have just put it down and walked away. Due to their outrage it is now a bestseller, I love that! If this book makes people who are not interested in reading pick it up and devour it like I did, then I say go for it and write more! We love you E.L. James. Thanks for the controversy and for the unfortunate realization that we live in a country where books can still be banned from our libraries and stores. How sad for us.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|More than just a scary movie! Has you thinking as you watch! What will happen next or what did happen? Plot develops very well. If you love horror and time travel, this is the one to watch!
B007ZD17XO|3.0|I've enjoyed the game, loved the graphics, but I get so stuck on a level it ceases to be enjoyable. Hours on the same level is frustrating!!
B0086700CM|4.0|I have been wanting this game to be available for the Kindle since I got mine. It's a great game. I would say download now if you like jumping and dinning and turning a lot.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I had never heard of Ken Follett until a family member begged me to read him. I started with PILLARS OF THE EARTH and just loved it. WORLD WITHOUT END is just as strong. Interestingly, it DOESN'T pick up where PILLARS OF THE EARTH ended but jumps forward one hundred and fifty years. This requires a completely new cast of characters, and although some of the characters claim to be related to those in the earlier book, it really wasn't necessary to have that connection. As in the previous book, WORLD WITHOUT END opened with a powerful image, and closed with another one, so that it had a satisfyingly resonant ending, something, I fear that is increasingly becoming as rare as hen's teeth.<br /><br />Despite complaints by some readers that the book was over-long, I found it completely absorbing up until the end. The characters were well-rounded and realistically portrayed, and the events that happened to them were well-grounded in their motivations. In short, I highly recommend this novel. If you love PILLARS OF THE EARTH, I don't think you will be disappointed by WORLD WITHOUT END.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this is so useful and I can have fun and send it to anyone or post it anywhere!!!! I love it!!!!!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I read this novel right after finishing WORLD WITHOUT END, so it was a bit of a jolt to get myself used to 1911, having left the last novel in 1361. But once I'd made the adjustment, I found myself gripped by another strong cast of characters and the disparate lives that they lead. It was sheer genius for author Ken Follett to create characters that were placed strategically in various different places of the world (Wales, England, Russia, Germany and the United States), and yet have connections to each other by way of family ties, friendships or because of their employment. Follett has a way of taking unlikeable characters and making the reader interested in these people, so that even when they misbehave, we still want to see what they do next.<br /><br />This is a large novel that spans thirteen years, from the coronation of King George V in 1911 to the year 1924 when everything has fallen apart after a truly dreadful war. But Follett does not give us a twentieth-century ending where everything just stops. Nor does he use his ending as a cheap way of marketing the next volume. Instead, we have an ending that is just perfect in my opinion. I loved it, and I look forward to reading the next volume in this series. Five stars.
B002N5N5M0|2.0|Disc two and disc four were duplicate discs.  While it was marked \\"Disc 2\\", the content was actually that of Disc 4.  A BIG DISAPOINTMENT!
B00772M1F6|5.0|Wow! The most energetic flashback since the Stray Cats. A real voice & REAL music without computer processing. As you listen, you'll visualize these guys jamming & having a great time, & you'll want to dance. Plenty of baritone sax- the sound & songs remind me of Little Richard from the 50's. Great debut album- looking forward to more!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Well thought out, nice pacing, can't wait for the next book! Wonderful intricate story line. Liked how we followed the maturation process of Valein and his companions. Gradual unveiling of the mystery.

0307592731|5.0|I read this a few weeks ago and as a mother of two small boys, ages 5 & 7, my time is a limited commodity.  I read this every spare moment I could find, often staying up late.  The title describes both Strayed's behaviors prior to leaving on her trek as well as the emotional state of well-being.  I began to procrastinate near the end of the book because I simply didn't want the book to end. Even though my life path has been incredibly different from the author's (my parents are amazing! Married 48+ years, healthy childhood upbringing) I could relate to the book and author on so many levels, I was born just a few days after Cheryl Strayed (September, 1968) and dealt with tragedy in 1986 that rocked my world and left me reeling in pain and acting out.  Also, my oldest son was born 3 days after Doug's death in October, 2004.  What I found absolutely refreshing in such an image driven culture is that the author was willing to be so honest and transparent. Well-written, grammatically concise.  Her imagery was so vivid I could actually see her clutching that hiking boot to her chest or lusting after the Snapple lemonade!  And I could envision poor pale Albert on his way out of the campground.  Thank you for this engaging read.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I have put a lot of time into this game. I really enjoy playing it. My biggest problem is the same as others. The game gives you goals to visit other players homes but keep getting a need to update warning. I let it restart, although I don't think it updates, and still get the same error message. This makes it impossible to complete some goals. I've sent emails to their support techs, but nothing has come of it yet.<br /><br />As far as getting out of the game, click the Icon in the lower right corner of screen and go to options. You're pull up bar at the bottom will come back and you can hit the home button.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|I received the complete first season as a gift from a friend, and I immediately purchased the second season.

0345803485|3.0|I just don't get what all the fuss is about.  I spent 500 pages of my time giving it a chance, and was left wanting.  There is a lot of erotic sex and a lot of good fantasy, and big kudos to the author for her writing style.  There is a lot of talent there.  Given that, I believe her talents were not put to the  best use.  Basically, ladies, it is concerning that so many women are going nuts over this book.  This has to be the best example of an unheatlthy, immature, and co dependent relationship and people are ROMANTICIZING it.  I had a similar relationship in a marriage.  Sex was \\"hit it out of the park\\"everytime; however, the emotional mess that it created was devestating.  Please ladies, take your \\"vanilla\\" man every time and quit fantasizing about the relationship in this book....so destructive. Young women...please don't be naive and impressionable and pray for a man like this.  The most quotable line in this book is when Mr. Grey admits he is \\"50 shades of ****** up\\".  Yes he is.  Anastasia will never \\"love Mr. Grey into emotional health\\".  The most loving thing that can be done is for her to STAY AWAY and keep pointing him to a good TEAM OF THERAPISTS.  Not because of his sexual tastes, but because no one woman can ever heal this guys deep, deep wounds.  Ladies take heed.  There is NOTHING romantic about being so deep, so quick, and so thoroughly that someone you have no just a few weeks can mess you up this badly.  Not to mention...if you have waited so long to give away your virginity, why not wait until you KNOW this guy before jumpting into the sack. I know it is FICTION; however, the way women are gushing about his, it scares me to think that many women identify with this so deeply and passionately.  There are a lot of sick guys out there...you cannot FIX them.
B0053KWDES|4.0|Got this little amp to boost my iPhone & Grado 80 combo at the gym. I like my music loud when I'm pounding and plowing on the elliptical. The iPhone by itself was not loud enough, so I got this little amp after reading good reviews.<br />It definitely works. It makes it louder without destroying the music, only if you put it to High Gain and 2 bass boost does it start to get crunchy. I charge it every couple of days, not sure about the proclaimed 11 hours of so of use time, but I use it close to full volume.<br />Oh, also the way you attach it to the iPhone is weird. With a thick silicone band like the kind people wear on their wrists to show their support for something. It gets in the way of the screen. Not sure what a better way would be, I think a temporary case you could put both into? I don't have a case on my iPhone so don't want to add velcro to it. Dunno, the strap may be the simplest way. I'd recommend this to others who want move volume out of their iPhone and headphone combo. Put it this way, with the open back design of the Grado's and this little amp, if someone liked my music, they could probably put their iPhone up next to my head and Shazam what I'm listening to....

B007IQX1G4|1.0|I paid 1.99 for this movie... Which was about 1.98 too much. The movie has no real plot, no real conclusion, and no real good acting.  It was a disaster on about every single level.<br /><br />The movie centers around Charlize Theron, a depressed,  dysfunctional, slightly whacked writer who leaves her apartment in Minneapolis to go back to her small town and win back an old flame, who is now married with a wife and newborn baby....  In theory, this movie could have worked, been filled with lots of witty, funny commentary,  etc.....  But somewhere it went horribly, horribly wrong.  It barely touched comedy, the plot was too thin to really qualify as drama....  This movie belongs in its own category of \\" Hot mess\\".<br /><br />I would not recommend this to anyone.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was such a surprise to me.<br />I was never bored,confused or felt it lacking anywhere.<br />I did get absorbed,gratification and thrilled that this book proceeded my expectations!<br />Buy this book,you won't be disappointed at all!
B001E45XT4|5.0|great for the price.  Very comfortable.  It took me a bit to get used to them as I can't hear myself speak as well with them on but now I'm fine with it.
B003B02OQ4|5.0|This is another of John Grisham's books that I couldn't put down. I ordered the Kindle version and am extremely impressed by the ease of ordering and using Kindle.
B000JIHP88|1.0|I purchased this product after comparing it to the mobiles that project onto the wall. I was super excited to get it in the mail but after I put it together and purchased the batteries for this thing, it didn't work right. Only the leaves would move and they did that very poorly. The lights and sound didn't work at all. Also, this mobile is RIDICULOUSLY LOW. Once your baby can reach up, that things is coming down!! What a piece of crap. I'm just sending it back for a refund because I don't have the time to wait and mess with the replacement mobile that Amazon will send.<br /><br />Word of advice. Don't buy this mobile, just keep looking!
B00004ST9Q|5.0|As others have said - this is a MUST HAVE for Whitney fans.  Others have complained that alot of her videos were not included on this DVD.  While nothing from the \\"I Look To You\\" album is on here, nearly everything else is.  There are 25 videos in total, the only ones I can think of that are not included are \\"Count On Me\\", \\"Miracle\\", and \\"My Name Is Not Susan\\".  Everything you want to see is on here, including \\"Exhale, Shoop Shoop\\", which others said was not included (maybe some videos have been added to this DVD recently).<br /><br />  I haven't even watched the bonus materials yet, but after watching all the videos in one shot, I was so delighted that I had to come on and give a good review so that all Whitney fans order this.  If you're a REAL BIG Whitney fan like I am, you'll like it just because of the couple of pictures of Whitney inside the DVD case, and the \\"Interactive\\" Whitney that welcomes you when the DVD starts.  Nice to see some new material/pics/interviews of Whitney, I just can't get enough of the gone-far-too-soon Whitney.<br /><br />  Also, please note that many of the reviews that are on here talk about all the songs being remixed - that must only be the CD version, for some reason they are reviewing they CD version on the DVD product site.  The DVD is fine, all the videos/songs are what you are expecting.  ENJOY!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is pure garbage. It was bought by accident... clicked a wrong button and I want it OFF my Kindle !!!!! Lable it for what it is.... poorly written pornography.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really like the series but feel that it could have benefited from more of a plot than just sex.

B0059XTUEK|4.0|Michelle Williams does a fantastic job portraying the two sides of Marilyn.  Eddie Redmayne, in his portrayal of Colin Clark, is remarkably eloquent!  The scene between Williams and Redmayne, Marilyn at 31 and Clark at 23, at the all boys private high-school Clark graduated from in England, is so magical that you really must see it!  Marilyn, on a day-break from the shooting schedule, at the high-school, when confronted by a group of students, turns to Clark and says, \\"Should I become that other girl?\\"  Words don't give this scene justice.  A transfixing moment that can only be seen and heard to truly comprehend the depth of enlightenment this moment had to offer yours truly.  The entire movie is a highly refined tragedy, which may make watching it a bit of a drag.  But, the best part of this movie-going experience was reflecting afterwards on its perfect composure and innocence.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Samurai and zombies. What else could you need? Highly addictive entertainment that is fun and easy to learn. Would recommend.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I really like this game it has given me something to do when I am bored but don't feel like reading a book.<br />the only thing I do not like is how often I lose at it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|My sister told me about this book, and within days several other people mentioned it as if it was the best book ever. I bought it for my Kindle and could NOT believe how bad it was. The characters are all idiots. The writing is as if it was written my an 8th grader. All the main characters do the same thing over and over again. If I read one more time that the girl bit her lower lip or blushed I was going to scream. BAD writing. I doubt I'll finish the book. Save your money
0345803485|5.0|These books are an absolute MUST read!!!!  Buy them now and I promise you that you will NOT be able to put them down.  The people that say they don't like these books are prudes in my opinion.  These books are fiction! Of course they aren't going to reflect true life for the majority of people.  These books allow your imagination to go wild though!!  I had all three books read in four days!!  I promise you....you will not be able to put them down!!  I hope this love story will continue on with another trilogy!!!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this to be on the kindle for months. finally! Great game, hard to put down.
B000GX0QNM|4.0|The Revell Horton 229 kit is a highly detailed kit of what an operational HO-229 would have been.<br />It has a well detailed cockpit and armament bays. The decal sheet is thorough and includes octane markers and no-step demarcations.<br />An excellent kit for the money.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fun. I do like it but my skills are not great yet. this game can be a lot of fun if u r patient :)
B000W05I5U|1.0|Bought this on Mp3...I didn't realize that you have to pay a fee for Cloud player too, so I didn't get this on my Kindle. Wasted $9.99 on this.
B0085776BG|2.0|While it's not a rehash of the Tuskegee airmen where Laurence Fishburne and ALSO Cuba Gooding Jr. act. It's not better than that.<br />For the not famous portion of the cast the acting could have used some polishing because the capacity of the people involved is there, you just don't see them doing their best, except for maybe Ne-Yo as the comic relief.<br />The dialog is clumsy and somewhat C movie quality as is specially noticeable in the first scene.<br />Special effects are o.k. the top shots of the base leave something to be desired.<br /><br />All in all this movie requires two things to become actually good.<br /><br />1: Better direction and demand on its actors.<br />2: Better edition.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|but now it wont let me play. it wont load even aftef i deleted it and tried to download it again. lost all the games i unlock. what a waste of time

B000FBFN1U|2.0|I have read the first three books of the \\"Game Of Thrones\\" series, and have been loathe to write a review. The author is a superb writer. It is so difficult to write at his level that I feel uncomfortable with what I have to say.<br />Without question, it is his writing that has carried me through some of the more complex or slow areas of each of the books. I find myself truly able to suspend disbelief; for me that is both good and bad in this series.<br /><br />Let me say that I would not recommend this even for teenaged readers. I am not sure I would recommend it to young adults! While even the sex (please let us not confuse rape and molestation with sex?) is not particularly healthy, the violence is extreme and sudden. I have read many novels of all genres in my sixty years, yet few have effected me with such depression and sadness.<br /><br />I won't be a spoiler when it comes to this book; suffice it to say that I could not go on to the fourth book right away,<br />and am not sure I will pick it up at all. There have been many complaints about the amount of sex in this series; my complaint is that rape and forced sex is not just \\"sex\\". When my kids were growing up, I never objected to nudity or sex, but I would not let them watch or read media which contained unhealthy sex or violence. My theory was that I hoped that they would grow up to enjoy healthy sex, but I prayed that they would not be subjected to or enjoy violence. (One might have laughed watching my husband try to cover the eyes of one of our sons during a particularly lascivious sex scene in a movie while I giggled. But, this is DIFFERENT.).<br /><br />Martin, throughout this series is exploring the darkest side of mankind. I used to think that this belonged in the \\"horror\\" genre.<br /><br />I have to believe that this writer has a kinder and gentler worldview in some of his other books?  While many of us<br />have had to live with terrible grief in our lives, we go to the fantasy genre to avoid themacabre. These books are no vacation from the real world. While particularly absorbing, they are emotionally exhausting.<br /><br />My recommendation is that if you love the t.v. series (and we do, with some similar reservations, at least to date), and decide to read all of these books,try not to invest emotionally in any character as it is not easy to be sure who is hero and who is villain; their fates are as realistic as if they were living in harsh feudal times. This stuff is DARK; very DARK.<br /><br />I would love to read other books by this author which have similarly well written plots and character development, but<br />were on the less and horrible spectrum of fanstasy. After all, Tolkien managed to give us more realistic elves (some that were truly not good hearted) without depressing us or making our stomachs roil over the fate of charcters in which<br />we had a two book investment. I am made of fairly tough stuff, yet I was depressed and nauseated at the end of this book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it's. not like the old game but it's. still really fun<br />I like playing it. Though it can be tedious.
B005CRQ4XI|1.0|I haven't read the book, but how can a hardcopy be selling for less than the Kindle version.  This is crazy.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The actual story had a far different effect on me than my first expectations.  It isn't about children killing one another.  I saw it as the abuse of power and control over others -- the cruelty that can be displayed in human history, including our present news reports.  It is also about the complexity and \\"messiness\\" of human relationships, including stories of tenderness and self-sacrifice.  It is a mixture of Orwel's \\"1984\\" and \\"Animal Farm\\".  I will be waiting to see how well it translates into the movie media.
B0086700CM|5.0|Lots of items and upgrades along with its addictive gameplay. and the fact that it's FREE! why not get it?
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a great game! wish they gave you more energy without paying out real cash&hellip; not sure it would be worth it.

0812981448|4.0|Author of Start Something That Matters, Chief Shoe Giver of Toms, Blake Mycoskie saw something during his vacation in Argentina.  His mission was to \\"lose myself in its culture\\".  And that he did.  While visiting Argentina, Blake met children whose families were too poor to buy shoes for each kid.  These kids were getting cuts and bruises that eventually developed into some type of infection caused by the dirt and garbage that caused these blisters and cuts.  Blake also found that when these children were getting shoes donated to them they were the wrong sizes so many children were left without any shoes.<br /><br />Mycoskies idea of helping these children is to donate a pair of shoes in the correct size for every shoe purchased.  This is a great way to help others in need and also to \\"start something that matters\\".  His company TOMS, which was established in his cozy apartment located in Los Angeles, California is making a profit off of his idea.  Mycoskie has taken his social entrepreneurship to the likes of Hollywood Stars.  He has used his resources to help these children of Argentina.  Now when you go shopping in a mall you can see the TOMS shoes being sold in just about every city.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is very addictive and lots of fun.  its worth the download!  some of the games aren't amazing but there are plenty to choose from!!!
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|This game is boring. Too many repeats of hidden items and mini games and not enough connection between scenes. I would not recommend spending money on this game.
B002BWP49C|4.0|As with each of the previous Twilight saga movies this is a slow moving film that deviates significantly from the book.  However it is also the first of the series I enjoyed at all.  This is also the first film of the series that I found the love story between Bella and Edward to be somewhat believable.  Unfortunately much of the emotion from the book is lost and Edward's suffering is minimized or barely apparent in the film though he believes he is near to losing Bella for all of eternity during much of the film.  As with all previous films the beauty, magic, and grace of the vampires is entirely lost.  The wolves are frequently silly looking and in one scene when we listen in on the telepathic communications among the wolves is so cheesy I died a little inside and wished the entire scene had been cut.  After all so much is left out of the films how much could the movie have suffered by leaving that out too?  As the saga draws to a close it seems that the characters are finally almost ready for prime time.  It's a shame that it's taken so long and that we're left with these films as the representation of mediocre, but entertaining book series.  Let's hope the final movie is done as well or better as this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|The gameplay is simple, run away from the demon monkeys and swipe to turn, jump and duck. It sounds kind of stupid, but it is seriously addictice when you begin to play.
B0086700CM|5.0|you cannot stop playing this game its so addictive not only that it looks 3d and hd it is my favorite game I'm glad they finally got it on the kindle fire
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have been playing nothing but this game a since I got it as the free app. This is a great game for anyone who likes sudoku and puzzles.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|The Game of Thrones season one series was very good.  The box set had some informative material, such as, the map of the world and family houses.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have to admit that I am 19 and not once ashamed of this book...<br />Me and my mom are reading this book together and love it.<br />People can say what they want but I am a Christian.I believe everything the Bible says and I still am okay with reading this series. It is a must buy and worth every penny.<br /><br />So buy it and give it a chance the story line is great.<br />So glad I read it and whether it is a sin for sex before marriage I think that you know what's right and wrong so I do not believe this book makes you do wrong that is your choice.<br /><br />Give it a chance.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's the best, I love it, I rate this on a scale 1-10 I say 53. You have to try to complete a bunch of fun objectives.The game is a person in an abandoned temple and you have to run away from demon monkeys you slide down, jump, slide right and left. There are mega coins, speed boost, invisability, and other special power boosts. There is no end until you fall, get eaten, burn, if you don't slide down, don't slide right, or don't slide left
0307716546|5.0|Rosamund Lupton knows how to begin a novel with a flash, and then never let it fizzle. \\"Afterwards\\" is more developed, more fulfilling, and touches more family relationships than did her first book, \\"Sister.\\"<br /><br />In the past, I have not been much-interested in the paranormal, with the exception of Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" When I saw \\"Afterwards\\" compared to that book, I thought it would be one I would like. Wrong, because \\"like\\" is insufficient. I LOVED THIS BOOK.<br /><br />Lupton provides a complexity of narration. She sets the stakes as high as they can be set, life or death. Huge decisions must be made. There are logical complications for every character.<br /><br />The plot involves a fire at a children's private school. Seventeen-year-old, whimsical, and spirited, the beautiful Jennifer is badly burned. Her mother is also hurt. Out of the fire they are taken into the hospital, where the two, Jen and her mother Grace, have the ability to talk to one another (in an ESP-out of body way). They follow other characters, those they love as well as those they suspect of being involved in the fire.<br /><br />Everyone wants to find the arsonist. Is it Jen's little brother? the fired teacher? the fired teacher's bitter wife? the jealous, replaced secretary? As the investigation unfolds, we learn more about Jennifer's bid for freedom as a seventeen-year-old in love. She doesn't really care if she goes on to college. She keeps secrets about the stalking that has been escalating in her life.<br /><br />We meet her aunt, a fired-up policewoman, whom Grace has always disliked because of jealousy, and Grace's husband, a no-nonsense man, who keeps his emotions in check and wishes the kids were more disciplined. The various moms and dads of the school and the principal--no one's life is untouched by the investigation and by the tragedy unfolding.<br /><br />Is there life after death? Is there love in a coma? This heart-wrenching novel is not afraid to hazard some guesses about \\"afterwards.\\"sses about \\"afterwards.\\"
B008578PRK|3.0|The movie was good as ghost stories go.  Gets you jumping a little and gives you the creeps a little but for die hard scary movie fans maybe not so much.  Story line is slow to become to clear, not a bad thing, but is still unclear.  The solution seems to come to easy.  As for Daniel he does a good job with facial expressions but dialog is thin and makes wonder if he could act in a speaking part.  Overall it's OK but needed a little more meat on the bone.
B00846REIS|5.0|I am giving this book 5 stars purely based on the sexiness of it!  It definitely serves its purpose in the \\"erotic\\" department and that is why most of us chose to read it!  Having said that, I felt that it was incomplete.  I was left questioning Gideon's family issues.  I understood his dislike for Christopher, but why the rest of his family and what is his aversion to the house?  I was also confused about his parasomnia because I was under the impression that Gideon was sexually abused as a child and was experiencing nightmares for that reason.  If you really think about it, there were a lot of contradictions.<br /><br />Regardless, it was an enjoyable, hot read!
B0086700CM|5.0|I really love this app over all the other apps I have! It has great graphics and is very addicting. If I could vote this game for &quot;The Game of the Year&quot; I would definitely do it!
B0086700CM|5.0|good free game it can be hard at times but that's what makes it a good game its worth getting
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The Help was a wonderful movie. I enjoyed watching it with friends. We laughed and cried together. One can't imagine what went on back in the day of having a black maid. Parts were so funny we couldn't stop laughing and other parts were really sad to think that people could be so mean to women who were taking care of their kids and cleaning up after them. Being ordered around and having to wait on them hand and foot. I would recomend this movie to everyone. and I would watch this one again
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I am a fan of David Baldacci and this book did not disappoint me. Well written and fast paced, it keeps you entertained all the way through. I highly recommend reading this book.
B005MYEQ4U|3.0|the movie was an average movie for my taste. I seemed to have gotten lost a good bit. It went from present day to different era's in time. I am not sure that I would watch this movie again
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was not out to get shredded, but I was looking for a great workout that I could do in 20 minutes.  I like to exercise, and since having a baby it is challenging to find time.  I've kept in decent shape by walking a lot.  But I wanted something I could do at home during naptime that would get some strength training in and get my mom belly trimmed down.  This is just the ticket.  I like the approach with the levels.  I'm on level 3 now and I feel stronger and think I look toned.  You really get a great workout in 20 minutes. Just when you think you can go another minute, it's done:-) These are exercises that I wouldn't do on my own without motivation, but Jillian manages to be encouraging without being annoying. I can see myself getting more of her tapes. I don't think it will replace my cardio for overall health and fitness, but this has been a great addition to my day.  Highly recommend.

B0084P9202|5.0|Valtari, means \\"steamroller\\" in Icelandic, which I believe at best would be a poor metaphor for a certain dynamic sensibility that has come to define most post rock.  To what degree Sigur Ros walk the line between ambient music and post rock is anyone's guess, though I believe there are fans who gravitate towards one of those two musical tendencies manifest in their music.  For those who have more of an affinity for the former, this album will be a welcome surprise.  Riceboy Sleeps, the 2009 collaboration between Sigur Ros frontman \\"Jonsi\\" Briggson and Alex Somers, has left an indelible mark on Valtari.  The first two tracks, Eq Anda and Ekki Mukk seem like multilayered tracks which might have appeared on that album, albeit with more textured and developed themes which elevate it beyond mere background music rich Riceboy Sleeps lushly settled into at times.  I think if one listened to the first two songs on this album in isolation, the album could in fact seem flat.  Are they just running through the motions at this point?<br /><br />The danger of a group like Sigur Ros is that their ability to do what few groups have done, i.e., make truly unique, dare I say revolutionary music, can become their own pitfall.  Sigur Ros is a signature sound, a blessing of true creativity which can quickly devolve into paradigmatic paralysis.  What I believe follows in Varut is a harbinger that to a subtle pain and intensity one could staunchly articulate is lurking within a singularly struck piano key which echos in painful reminiscence and loss.  In fact, what some what believe is Sigur Ros' most anemic album may very well in fact be their most emotionally and philosophically wrought work to date.  It is perhaps painfully mournful, without the fanfare of Med sud i eyrum vid, which I viewed as a form of life-affirmation in the face of existential absurdity that ends in unceremonious death. As I mentioned in a past review, Sigur Ros seem to be grappling with the dichotomy of life anddeath in their music, beautifully expressing the peaks and troughs of our complicated relationship with this fleeting spark of consciousness that was bestowed upon us all.  As Rembihnutur ferries us on with the clockwork click of an old time piece, Dantalogn seems to find sanctuary in a cathedral of sound, resonating like a spiritual echo of All Alright from their previous effort.  But the chorus, rather than finding resolution in a mournful tone of acceptance, rather leaps like a flame for a horizon it cannot catch.  In fact, a complete lack of resolution seems to be the predominate theme of this album.  There is no catch and release of the typical post-rock crescendo, there is no catharsis.  This has gone beyond the formula of exit music for a film.  This is where you are after the adrenaline rush of universal expansiveness has shrunk your dilated pupils back down to size and you are alone in your car in the cinema parking lot, waiting to drive the frosted streets through winter twilight whereby no amount of appreciation will save the abstraction of forever from your and my very definite end.<br /><br />That feeling seems to best be exhibited in Varteldur, a beautiful, flippant variation on a theme that never lets you settle despite the flickering lights of promise that shrink from variegated strips of fire in the sky ahead.  But then twilight fades to night, until a few slivers of red are engulfed in the navy swirl of sky. Varteldur fades into the more deeply ominous and anxiety-laden tones of Valtari.  Its something akin to a music box chasing revolutions in a black and white photo to the backdrop of a wavering and then fading spectral echo.  Listen to it: there has never been this much genuine loss in a Sigur Ros song.  It's a pain so deep I feel I'm cheating it by even trying to describe it.  I don't even know if it is a place one needs to go.  I don't by any means want to put words into bassist Georg Hólm's mouth.  In a recent interview with Rolling Stone,he said this album was difficult to talk about, and based on Valtari, I believe the have managed to mirror the eternal abyss over which we hover.  You can only begin to feel the heart wrenching depths, but it is too much, and you stop going; it will destroy you.  Fjogur Piano brings no resolution to Valtari, it is simply a much needed intermission, we've seen what's ahead, it terrifies us, but let us worry about that journey another time it seems to say.  But the hope it promises is tainted, we have felt something that cannot be unfelt.<br /><br />Kvistur comes shrieking back with a sorrowful and unsettling forbiddance, something akin to losing consciousness in the presence of a beast, fading into a dreamy respite under a peaceful pagoda dripping notes from a FIogur Piano.  But you are awake again, less in the grips of Valtari, but rather in the nervous sweat that it in some way is your destiny. There is an inevitability being expressed in this album, something fundamental about the human experience that, for this time, cannot be masked over in beauty and sentimentality.  It is something Valtari demands we face, though as a musical adventure it is merely a reflection of this feeling that does nothing to promise resolution.  I realize that does not sound like the most pleasant musical experience in the world, and for many it won't be.  I cannot say it will be worthwhile for everyone to explore these depths, since neither I nor the album can propose anything resembling an answer, let alone articulate the painful questions about life Valtari is answering.  By Logn, you have no returned to the beginning, nor have you resolved what came before, but you have been given a glimpse into something that is real, something perhaps so real it will shake the stupefying simulacrum of reality that many of fallen into right down to its foundations.  This is life, this is art, this is creation, this is a a solemn reminder of what it means for us to be here, to be alive.  I recommendthis album to anyone who has made it their life's ambition to understand just what it means to be a real human being, for all the pain that will entail.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|This is an amazing game. It's hard to believe that it runs on a phone. I'm running it on the Samsung Galaxy S2, and the game is flawless. The graphics are brilliant, the action is fast. Great job, and thanks to the developers!

0316017930|5.0|This book is well worth reading.  It is a fascinating look at all the factors that go into the making of success or failure, with Bill Gates and The Beatles as examples of success, and the Korean Airline as an example of failure.  I couldn't put it down.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|i almost didn't read it because of the negative reviews on here but im glad i did . a serious page turner, orgasmic...looked forward to reading it every night ! so glad there are two more books :)
B0065GC0BA|3.0|This book is not easy to rate. I thoroughly enjoyed the love story as it developed and found it very realistic and believable. I did not like the style of writing and the switch between perspectives, which in my opinion only served the purpose of adding pages to the book. The one important person who should have had a voice, Will, wasn't allowed even one chapter. There were little irritating bits throughout, like the author starting to sometimes call Treena by her proper name of Katrina later in the book. All in all not a bad read, but a different writing style would have appealed to me more.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|AND DEAL WITH IT!!! This is fiction, people. Entertainment. A book! I thought it was the perfect book to take with me to the beach for an entertaining read. Which it was. I may read it again. It might revive a few marriages, even. I'm single and have a vibrator to keep me company (it doesn't leave wet towels on the floor) and had tons of fun while reading this book. I've just purchased the second book in the trilogy and am really looking forward to reading it. Oh - by the way, I'm 65! And still alive!

B0084IG7KC|2.0|While the written series \\"The Hunger Games\\" is quite a good read (from what I've heard), this movie is actually pretty bad. The main elements of the plot line are all there, however the bits and pieces that cause the film to be enjoyable and allow the viewer to watch and simply be entertained and not confused are all left out. Mix that with the horrible \\"Action\\" camera-work and you're left with a film that is both unwatchable and incoherent.<br /><br />The reason the Harry Potter series has been so successful over 7 films and 6 books is because each of them have a beginning, middle, climax, and end. All of the pertinent details are answered by the end, and more are opened to lead into the next one. By the end of it you're left wondering what will come, and not what just happened. While the first book in the series is very descript (again, from what I've heard), the film leaves out details of the character's pasts, relationships, and thought processes. In all, I spent more time asking my friend who read the book what just happened instead of enjoying what was to come.<br /><br />When it comes to the actual viewing part, literally the only still shot was of an explosion... My confusion from lack of information was certainly not eloped by this. When it comes to fight scenes you have no idea what is happening until it is over, and even then that can take some time.<br /><br />In all, I just couldn't enjoy it, and while I honestly tried my best to get past all of the flaws, confusion, and want to vomit from a shaky camera, I simply couldn't.<br /><br />I would recommend renting it when it comes out before dropping... however much it will cost. You may be like me and simply can't take the camera shake, or didn't read the book and are utterly confused. When both combined, it's rendered unwatchable.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. its so much to play. I play during school.. I cant stop playing.  I like how the graphics are.

B00005JKED|5.0|This movie was all it's trumped up to be. Denzel Washington won an Oscar for his role. It was gritty and real with a twist. There is some violence and a lot of cursing, but that's true to life as well. In other words: buy this fast-paced movie full of action!
B0017GERLE|4.0|This three disc set includes The Karate Kid(June/84),The Karate Kid 2(Oct/86)and finally The Karate Kid 3(June/89).All three star Pat Morita as Mr.Miyagi and Ralph Macchio as Daniel LaRusso,with varying cast changes throughout the rest of the series.The core of these series lies in elements of the classic underdog becoming a winner,specifically Daniel,the unlikeliest of guys in looks and physique, becoming the unlikeliest of Karate champions and overcoming great odds and travails to do it.The series was a great hit in its day and surprisingly still holds up rather well today.<br />The Karate Kid starts the franchise with a story of Daniel and his mother who move from New Jersey to California to an apartment complex there to start a new life.The superintendent of the apartments is a Japanese-American,Mr.Miyagi,a former member of the most decorated unit of WW2,the all Japanese battalion of the 442nd.In his spare time he likes to tend to his bonsai tree collection which twigs the interest of Daniel,and the two become fast friends.Enter actress Elizabeth Shue who is attracted to Daniel,but her ex has something to say about this \\"get together\\",who just happens to know Karate.The tension escalates between Daniel and her ex,culminating in a few beatings by him and his gang.Mr.Miyagi intervenes at one of them and decides to help teach Daniel the art of Karate.The ex's teacher and Miyagi have a confrontation in which it is decided that Daniel will compete in the Karate championships against his best student,in exchange for a truce.Mr.Miyagi goes about trying to teach Daniel what he knows.It is a grinding time as Daniel is made to do all sorts of seemingly unrelated tasks(wax on,wax off!)until he finally twigs on that it may be unorthodox,but it is indeed an essential part of his growth both inward and outward.Mr.Miyagi and Daniel become like father and son and the day of the tournament arrives and the competition is stiff.Of course in the final round Daniel's adversary uses every mean trick in the book to hurt him unnecessarily,and through sheer will power Daniel proves triumphant.<br />The is certainly the best of the series as we watch Daniel's personal growth and his heart felt relationship with his mentor become solidified.It is the ultimate triumph over seemingly unobtainable odds and the film's fadeout as Daniel and Mr.Miyagi celebrate warms the heart.Pat Morita's performance was right on the money as Daniel's teacher,and he was even nominated for best supporting actor that year(not winning).4-4 1/2 stars.<br />The Karate Kid 2 finds our two friends flying to Mr.Miyagi's home island of Okinawa.It seems his father has fallen fatally ill and he is returning home to see him.However there is alot of tension on two fronts;first is the girl he left behind,who never married and still loves him,and his ex best friend who now owns practically every major industry there and is very rich;and he wants Miyagi's hide for some past \\"disgraces\\".The tensions build between the two as both have deep feelings for Miyagi's girlfriend.Also Daniel becomes the target of Miyagi's rival's nephew.Of course this causes a culmination of events in a final fight to the finish.However a reconciliation does take place between not only Miyagi and his old flame but between him and his best friend.<br />This film has a nice story line to it and almost comes up to the same level as its predecessor.Morita is great in it as usual and is the rock all these films hinge on.4 stars.<br />The Karate Kid 3 finds our hero Daniel and Miyagi returning from Okinawa only to find their apartment building has been sold out from under them and Mr.Miyagi is now out of a job.Also his adversary's teacher from the first film is now out of business,but a rich old ex army buddy helps him put his business back on foot and also helps him to seek revenge on Daniel and Miyagi.To this end they hire a bad boy of the Karate world who puts pressure on Daniel to compete in the upcoming Karate championships.Daniel continues to refuse until he has his back to the wall and can no longer do so.To top this,the man pulling all the strings pretends to befriend him and teaches him some moves designed to put him on the wrong path.When Daniel realizes his mistake Mr.Miyagi,who has up to this point refused to teach Daniel,now jumps in to help his apprentice.The tournament comes and ends in the same fashion as the first film.<br />This film is not of the same caliber as the first two and it attempts to latch onto the first movies' hooks much too often,which diminishes its own punch.Morita,it goes without saying,is still the best thing about these films and really gives it their life.3 stars.<br />Technically speaking the films are all in their widescreen a/r's and look clear and crisp.The first film has commentaries and four featurettes,the 2nd film has one featurette and an interactive game and the third feature just has all the trailers and some bio info.<br />All in all a very good set to own of the best of the four Karate Kid movies.The fourth,while not having Macchio in it does have Morita,but it is not enough to really save it or consider it among the caliber of these.Morita shines in all three and these underdog to winner based films will have you cheering Macchio and Morita all the way.Recommended.mpionships.Daniel continues to refuse until he has his back to the wall and can no longer do so.To top this,the man pulling all the strings pretends to befriend him and teaches him

B0073LWEXK|5.0|very good game. its an adventure game. it was a little hard and there is no hint button or help to start off the game. they Kinda just throw u in and hope u figure it out. I had to look up a walkthrough on the net to help me out in some parts. well worth the. 99.
140053271X|3.0|I will start by saying that as far as an ereader goes, the NOok can't really be beat. You can use this just like a book outside in the sun. What I don't like about it is not about it as much as purchasing books from Barns and Noble. Seems like every book I get is list price. All I can do is download from B&N too, it's not like I can shop on Amazon which I do a lot. so, Nook is great Barnse and nobel is just OK, maybe less than OK in my book (that's a pun!)
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|its a good game but there is no zoom or at least I couldn't find one. I played this on my kindle fire and some of the items were a little too small to find. other than that it was a very good game.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I had a car kit installed in my car a bit ago and at some point ios devices lost the ability to charge from it.  charge adapters rectified the issue for me but in general were always so bulky at the connecter point that it got hard to get a stable connection if using any sort of case on the ios device.  this device fixed it for me and fixed it good.  it's narrow enuf at the connection to where it gives a secure fit to every ios device i throw at it.  I read a few complaints that the fit isn't secure.  In my experience, couldn't be further from the truth.  It connects and once connected, mild movements won't disconnect it.  not sure how much experience those with an issue with it have had with third party solutions, but I have rarely seen a third party device hold on to the device like this does, it's snug.  it's not apple snug but nothing third party is.<br /><br />I was also pleasantly suprised to see that on the side, the device has a micro usb connector for charging.  tried it and works great for adding a charge to a bluetooth headset or something.  and yes, when connected, it'll both charge thru the micro usb and apple 30 pin at the same time.  I since bought another one for use inside the house.  I have a media room with a 10 foot sync cable so i can charge while on the couch.  issue was the connection was very loose and any slight movement would disconnect the cable.  this fixed that for me.<br /><br />as far as longevity, I've had em for a few weeks, no issues yet.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Oho! I knew it was only a matter of time before Kristen Stewart and I would cross paths. I've avoided the Twilight saga like the cooties, and so I've missed out on the fuss and the furor about her. But I couldn't pass up on SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN like I passed up on MIRROR MIRROR, and, it turns out, I sort of fancy Stewart's performance. Skin white as snow, lips red as roses, hair black as a raven's wing. That fleshes out Kristen Stewart to a tee. Still, it's nigh impossible to trump Charlize Theron's turn as Snow White's rather... self-absorbed... step-mother. Theron simply mesmerizes. She's so good there are moments you sympathize with her - that poor, gorgeous, demented queen who as a girl was cursed by a mother's dark gift. Evil begets evil, and you sense that Ravenna must have endured some unspeakable sh--. Not that that makes up for her nasty practice of sucking the beauty and vitality out of innocent girls... Queen Ravenna is like the grim fairy tale version of Project Runway.<br /><br />It's a darker iteration, grittier, moodier, more full-blooded. I think the Brothers Grimm would've approved of this interpretation; it matches their gristly sensibilities more. If you've brushed up on the fairy tale, then you know the kernel of the story. SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN tweaks and embellishes on that. When the vain and vile but oh-so-beautiful witch Ravenna (Theron) murders her husband, the king, on their wedding night, it upends the kingdom, sinks it into a realm of despair and oppression. We also learn that this is only the most recent in a long series of regicides that Ravenna has committed. The king had one young daughter, Snow White, lovely and bright and pure, whom Ravenna promptly sentences to incarceration in the castle dungeons. For years Snow White languishes in wretched confinement.<br /><br />I don't know how I feel about how the magic mirror is presented, the film granting it the ability to metamorphose, liquid metal like, into a faceless, flowing figure that stands before Ravenna whenever she extends that one familiar question. I get that they were trying to change it up with the mirror, but then they forgot the follow-thru. so, the mirror can assume a form. And then what? And then nothing.<br /><br />In the story I read ages ago, the huntsman takes Snow White into the woods, at the Queen's behest, and in the woods the huntsman was tasked with carving out Snow White's lungs and liver (if I remember it right) as proof of her demise. But the huntsman demonstrates mercy and allows Snow White to flee. He instead presents to the queen the lungs and liver of a boar, and so the queen comes to believe that Snow White was indeed deaders. And so the huntsman exits the tale. But you only have to glance at the film's title to get a whiff that the huntsman (Chris Hemsworth), this time out, lands a meatier role, sticks around a bit longer.<br /><br />Another fashion in which this film veers away from the fairy tale we know (**coughDisneyAnimatedFilmcough**): I like that there's only a smidgen of romance, but I like that the smidge that IS there is crucial to the plot. Not to get all Twilighty, but the story does force you to choose a camp to follow: that of the surly, drunken huntsman What'shisface or Snow White's childhood pal and the Duke's dashing son, William (Sam Claflin). Note that William is a bowman who seems to rival the Avengers' Hawkeye in uncanny marksmanship. Meanwhile, I think Chris Hemsworth exhibits solid acting chops, lending tortured depth and melancholia to his huntsman. He takes a Scottish accent out for a spin, and I'm gullible enough or listened to James Doohan enough to be convinced by it. But the trailers to ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER put Hemsworth's axe-work to shame.<br /><br />SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN flaunts a secret weapon, or rather, eight secret weapons, in the shapes of dwarves. It kinda sucks for actual dwarf actors out there, because the film employs normal-height actors who then were CG'd down to Gimli-size. But, then again, Peter Dinklage is damn busy nowadays. These contentious dwarves - as played by the likes of Ian McShane, Ray Winstone, and Nick Frost - end up stealing many scenes.<br /><br />It's a stunning-looking movie, or to quote my date: \\"Ohhh, so pretty!\\" Rupert Sanders, after a career of helming snazzy advertisements, makes his debut as a feature film director. He brings along that same eye for spectacular visuals. He lends a spooky and foreboding atmosphere to the twisted Black Forest, and it marks Snow White's abject desperation that she elects to seek dubious sanctuary within its sickly boughs. When tree branches make it a habit to transform into serpents, I tend to wonder where I left my chainsaw (sorry, tree huggers). Conversely, Sanders' depiction of the fairyland is pretty damn wondrous and speaks to that inner child still in you (yes, even you). The narrative further expands to allow for Snow's encounter (or yell-off) with a bridge troll, and, later, with a tribe of females that had committed self-mutilation rather than face the Queen's attention. The film's final action flourish consists of the almost requisite epic battle. I've gotta credit Kristen Stewart. She does have presence and she does have charisma. Or maybe those eyes suckered me in. She rolls off that hokey rousing rally speech and just about pulls it off, and that with a British accent (that, okay, occasionally strays). Still, maybe my favorite bit - and I realize I kind of pooh-poohed the romantic angle earlier - concerns the kiss that galvanizes the poisoned princess. I saw it coming, I'm sure you'll see it coming, but it was still a very strong scene. An \\"Oh, yeah!\\" kinda scene. Crap, there goes my mushy side. Great.

B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting soo long for the Kindle app store to get Temple Run I have it on my aneroid phone I love this game!!!!!!
B002GYI9C4|4.0|It is 530AM and I just finished reading this book: it's THAT good. It had me sneaking out of social events to steal a glance at a couple more pages, as I couldn't focus on the conversations: my mind kept being drawn back to allomancy and intrigue.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, the magic system is great. Its so ordered and logical that when people in the books perform amazing feats of magic it feels earned and all the more impressive. This magic system compares to other fantasy magic like a good kung fu fight compares to a micheal bay transformers explosion-fest. Good stuff, and learning about it ws one of the things that kept me turning pages late into the night.<br /><br />The other thing was the excellent characters, they never acted exceptionally illogically, always stayed consistant, and maybe even learned a little a little about life in the end, you know? The good old character arc and whatnot.<br /><br />And its a unique premise: the world is ashes and it's ruled by an evil god king and it's been that way for 1000 years. All the protagonists want to do is rebel a little, no one's even tried that for hundreds of years.<br /><br />This is one fantasy that no one is going to mention Tolkien when discribing. Thank god. Have you noticed how many fantasy books mention him in their blurbs? All of them.<br /><br />So, it's a great book and you should read it, kay? Me, I'm going to wait until I have a couple of days free before  starting the next one: now that I know I'm going to lose some sleep I can plan ahead.

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I have seen the stage and movie versions of Phantom of the Opera and adore the musical scores and choreography that has graced the senses for generations. And though it's true that \\"Love Never Dies\\" ventures forth in a different direction, I  appreciate the creativity of both its author and the actors. I commend Sir Andrew Lloyd Weber for taking us out of our comfort zone and giving us the opportunity to experience a different outcome to the most celebrated love story of all time. With such an ever changing world, all things are possible and no one can see (or know) the bigger picture. That is where imagination helps us leap past what we deem logical and enter a place where the dreams of the heart reside. Be brave and remain open to all the facets of love. Thank you again, Sir Andrew Lloyd Weber, and may God bless you always.
B0055PMURG|5.0|Soul surfer is one of the most inspirational movies I have ever watched. Bethany Hamilton is a young American teenage girl with enormous passion for surfing. She had her whole career in surfing ahead of her, as she just won a big surfing competition and became sponsored by Ripcurl. However, one tragic shark attack in the waters left her without her left arm. Daily activities became difficult to complete, and her life was changed entirely. After an unsuccessful competition, she thought of giving up, and decided to follow her church friends to help out after the natural disaster in Thailand. There, she learned about something greater than just surfing; she learned of love and compassion. It took Bethany a while, but she did decide to get back into the water and start surfing again. And though she did not win the Surfing Nationals competition, she gained the support and respect of her rival, Alana. In the end, she no longer mourns over the tragedy of her lost arm, but rejoices in the opportunity to be right where she is, doing what she loves and other people wanting to listen to her.<br /><br />Bethany Hamilton and her family are practicing Christians, and Bethany's faith in the Lord has become a crucial motivation towards her recovery and positive attitude. Bethany regularly attends a youth group, and her leader quoted from the bible, Jeremiah 29:11: \\"For I know the plans I have for you,\\" declares the Lord, \\"plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future\\". It is this quote that Bethany holds dear to, and slowly understands that even though something tragic has happened, something good will come out of it (as her youth group leader tells her in a heart-to-heart talk). At the end of the movie, we do see that something good has come out of it, because not only has she been able to overcome all obstacles and compete successfully in the Nationals surfing competition, but she has also been able to inspire others and give hope to people with asimilar situation. Bethany tells interviewers after the competition that she does not wish that she did not go surfing the day of the accident because it brought her to this very place, and also because the Lord did have a plan for her. This shows her wholehearted acceptance and trust in the Lord to watch over her, which is a real and touching portrayal of a Christian.<br /><br />Though the trailer pretty much sums up the entire movie, I believe this movie is a MUST WATCH. Knowing how the movie ends does not mean that you should not watch it. And the fact that the plot is based on the true experiences of Bethany makes it all the more intriguing and inspiring. One of my favorite quotes in the movie was at the end of the Nationals competition, when she told an interviewer \\"I didn't come here to win, I came here to surf\\". After all she has been through, it is beautiful to see that she has grown and matured so much since the beginning of her recovery. The overall message and theme of this movie is extremely positive, and will indeed leave the audience with questions and perhaps reexamination of their lives.

0062109383|5.0|I read this book when it first came out and loved it. When I found out it was available on disc, and read by Patti Smith herself, I had to get it. There is something especially compelling about hearing the author's voice reading her own words. Such a treat.<br /><br />This memoir focuses on Smith's intense bond with her lover/beloved friend/partner-in-crime, artist Robert Mapplethorpe. But it's also about her great love for NYC, and her own formation as an artist, poet, and musician. She went to New York, spent her first nights sleeping in a doorway, before meeting Mapplethorpe and discovering the city together. NYC in the 70s, and Patti was right in the heart of it. Hearing her voice telling her tale, she sounds like such an innocent, open to all experiences and to all the people she meets. Funny as it sounds, she seems to have been a kind of gritty, punk Forrest Gump, in the thick of every scene in the city, meeting and interacting with all the city's icons--before becoming one herself. Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Bruce Springsteen, Andy Warhol, William Burroughs, Grace Slick, and many, many more. And the places: CBGB's, Max's Kansas City, and of course, the infamous Chelsea Motel. It's all there. She recreates an era and shares it.<br /><br />The disc ends with poems Smith wrote for Sam Wagstaff's memorial, for Mapplethorpe's memorial, and others, and again, it is such a gift to hear her read her own poems. There's a resonance in the words and phrasing that is different from merely reading them on the page. Do yourself a favor and get this book on disc!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great games that will challenge you. This game keeps you from having to buy so many other apps. The best part is that its FREE!
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|I want my money back - just awful!  - have really never seen a worse movie - don't waste your time.
B0086700CM|5.0|the day you get this game is the day you will become an addict to it. Its a game that's fit for kids and fun for the whole family.
B0051UH6YM|5.0|An informative and enjoyable book.  Hilarious examples of the comma police correcting the use of commas.  Read about the comma that got someone hanged!  Amazing examples of misinterpretation of writing due to the placement of the comma, and why lawyers hate commas.  I only used one comma in my review--just before a coordinating conjunction--hope it's ok.
B0000634EV|5.0|Just as Alice in Chains self titled 1995 CD was met with much criticism, so too has down been met with the same. I myself frankly enjoyed the fresh change it was still heavy and yet light at the same time. Very fun to listen to. Growth as a band is natural, and that is the beauty of music sometimes listeners won't like what one has to play and or sing about, then again one isn't doing there job very well if it isn't offensive to someone now are they? :) Enjoyed listening to this, thank you Down for being yourselves and as a listener and artist in my own small right, I get it.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|I'm very happy to own this movie. It's sappy, romantic, and it has Hugh Jackman - need I say more?!
B006BDHAX0|1.0|I purchased the game and it wont even install!!!!!!!!!! I have tried numerous times and it is extremely irritating! I loved the free version.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad they just added Temple Run to the amazon app store. I seriously can not stop playing it. It is the best app ever invented. I love it sooooo much :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Fun, different, and intense, it offers an exciting game that keeps me playing for hours.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is fun and addicting, everytime you play there's something new you learn how to do. it does allow you to purchase things with real money, but ive found I've never had to use it :)
B005LAIHGI|5.0|Dictator is very fun movie! Yes, it is sometimes impolite, but no super gross scenes, though. Amazingly nice humour, exaggerating dictatorships throughout the world. Would not recommend to watch it with small kids, but otherwise definitely worth watching. In my view this how a comedy should look like, and not like \\"The Sitter\\", for example.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much its the best game ever I have been waiting so long for this app you will live it and its free so that is great!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun and easy game!<br /><br />You will have so much fun!  I highly recommend this game to people of all ages.

B0086700CM|5.0|I think this game is great for teens,its just the addition of beating your high score,and then when you beat you have to beat again.I played this 200 in the first 24 hours I had it.
0345803485|1.0|I was curious about this book after reading the Time magazine article  on women seeking domination.<br />Now that I have made it to page 150, I am flabbergasted at the phenomenal success of this book. It is incredibly badly written, the story is completely stupid, as well as the characters...<br />Read \\"Story of O\\" and compare!
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Although this film is Not your Original Disney Classic that we all love and cherish, this movie is a Gem in itself. It entertains from start to finish, will make you laugh and bring tears to your eyes, and has its own mystical-magic. It is presented as the 2012 dark and powerful fantasy version. A standalone indeed with dazzling magic, unstoppable action, and enough portions of both evil and innocence. Among the gnomes, dwarfs, giant trolls and fairies, there is much more to ponder. The acting roles of Charlise Theron, Kristen Stewart, and Chris Hemsworth were Excellent in Performance, and Amazing. The viewer of course feels sorry for the Huntsman, but he does find hope. We praise Snow White in all her beauty, purity, and innocence. Last but not least, we usually don't have much compassion for the dark and powerful Wicked Queen. This movie is Enjoyable as the Magic comes to life! Highly recommended for adventure and fantasy lovers, who like magical-mystical stories filled with action.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love the bible cover but it was too big. I also bought a bible at the same time, the bible cover didn't have dimensons or sizes, so i assumed it was going to fit,does it come smaller
B0080BFVPU|4.0|In my opinion this is an awesome movie!  I can watch it again and again and I still laugh.  If you havent seen it you must, it's great!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great ap!  As we collectively become more and more busy,  it is wonderful to have a product that reduces the learning curve time - extremely easy to use and navigate!  Wonderful.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|If there are redeeming qualities of this film I missed them! It was billed as heart throbbing thriller! It was not! Slow moving and hard to follow. More disjointed than the descendents.<br />Who were the swedes? Why go to the trouble to build a gun to kill \\"the American\\"<br />A waste of time unless you are 15 years old and like graphic sex!
0385344228|1.0|This is a dark, dreary and depressing novel that had little to share of any value.  I read it to the end and I was sorry that I did.
B00000IZOR|5.0|I purchased this for my 9 month old grandson for his birthday on Aug. 30th.  I'm not sure he'll be walking by his birthday, but if he is, or when he does start walking I'm sure he'll enjoy pulling it along behind him.  I know my 3 grown-up kids enjoyed very much in pulling a toy behind them, it's kind of an old school type of toy.  I'm hoping he'll enjoy it very much, just hoping his older siblings will give him the room to enjoy it.
B00012QM8G|5.0|A very powerful movie, since I had been to Israel, I understand their plight. The putting stones on his grave was very moving

B007C9N4H8|5.0|My 8 year old niece loved this movie! She watched it over and over again and paused it several times for parts I just had to watch... I admit, I enjoyed it myself!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|What a wonderful story by Suzanne Collins! This series is a fresh take on a post-appocalyptic future, one that aligns with and recognises the fundamental drivers of human behaviour - both heroic and monstrous - that are so clearly demonstrated almost every day in our present times. Suzanne controls the reader's emotions most skillfully, blending the enduring human determination not to broken and bound by hardship, cruelty and slavery with a vivid image of life in the future. The certainty that the circumstances of Suzanne's Panem could so easily come true makes the story an even more gripping read.<br /><br />Hunger Games is not just a tale for teens; I'm over 50, and I enjoyed the tale immensely, so much so that I'm sure I'll read the the books again in a few years. I strongly recommend the trilogy to both the young and those who'd like to stay that way.<br /><br />I found it especially convenient to be able to read all three books on my iPad. I hope you enjoy the series as much as I did.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|There are many excellant authors out there but we can rely on Follett to get the history right.<br /><br />Years ago he was researching a book which would have a few paragraphs about the old Pan Am Clippers, the flying boats that were the first commercial Trans-Atlantic air service. He travelled to our little community in eastern Canada and spent several days talking to locals who had worked in the industry servicing the planes and the passengers.<br /><br />He brings that same dedication to historical accuracy with the first of this trilogy and the evolution of the realtionship between the aristocracy and the commoners prior to and shortly after WWI.  I don't think he mentions though that Max Aitkin and Andrew Bonar Law were not only commoners but from the same small Canadian province that hosted the Pan Am Clippers until after WWII.
B0086700CM|5.0|i first had this game on my Ipod and loved it and now that its an app for the kindle fire it is amazing and the best game on the kindle fire!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|its good to get all the apocalypse stuff out of the way - finally! - now we have some more thought provoking yet entertaining shows - some time travel (with eliot ness- FBI), some good new monsters, scary clowns (sorry Sammie), unicorns, and lots of early time w/ bobby. some new odd characters (im always surprised shows like this dont bring these quirky character back for a lot more shows - X-files is the only one who kept bringing back the Lone Gunman - and it worked so well - listen Supernatural producers! - odd characters used a lot works!).[[ASIN:B001C9RL5K The Blessing Way]]<br />great season - cant wait for 8.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|Terminator who doesn't know about the movie. I love the sequel of Terminator .. transfer video is average 4/5 audio DTS HD 5.1 5/5 very difficult to access feature 3/5.<br />perhaps if you more patient may be some day there's another edition Ultimater Terminator edition
B005OK721G|5.0|I'm not a professional film critic like some people who review DVD movies. I liked this film; Zoe Saldana was the perfect choice for the lead role. I'm not sure if she did her own stunts but if she did, that makes her even more amazing. I really enjoyed how her character was cool and full of resolve of purpose from the beginning till the end of the story. I won't give away anything about the plot because I hate when people do that. This film is worth the price of the DVD. I've already watched it twice.
B000TGJ8IU|5.0|I like Brad Pitt even some people say it's jerk movie. But I loved this movie expecially when Brad jumped and kill the enemies.<br />in this edition very exclusive packaging<br />with digipack and a lot of bonus like book and other card makes so special
1401235417|4.0|The court of owls is one of the better batman stories I've read in a while but the quality drops a bit in the second half. The secret group the court of owls is a great addition to Batman rogues gallery and it provides a lot of mystique and intrigue for the reader. However, as great as the story starts off, it drops off considerably in the second half. The mystery of the court of owls is more interesting than what it is revealed about them. The story brought up some interesting theories involving the court of owls and the death of Bruce Waynes parents but it then drops them in favor of a more bland background about them. Overall this is still an excellent graphic novel but it could have been a little better. Maybe the second volume will be better in that department.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is the best. They should make another game like it.Great game. My favorite thing about it is completeing the goals.

1576875776|5.0|I was at the first showing of her prints and I fell in love with them. I couldn't wait to buy this book and it is wonderful. For the price I think this book is worth every penny and this would be a wonderful gift for any budding photographer. Given how long it took for these prints to be discovered this would also make a great gift because she's not an artist many people have heard of yet. There is something touching and beautiful about knowing that she didn't try to show off her talents while she was alive and kept them hidden away while always working on them. It is a true artist who does it only for the pleasure it brings.
B0086700CM|5.0|Glad it's finally on Kindle! My daughter has it for her Ipod and loves it.  So much fun!<br />Don't mind reviewng, but shorten the min word count
0143119680|5.0|I'm a self confessed slower reader.  Growing up reading was a chore, not something to enjoy.  This book provided strong enough characters to hook you in and make you want to finish such a large book.  They pull you in to their everyday lives and feelings and you grow to love them for all their flaws as if they were real people.  There is a perfect balance of fantasy, suspense, history, romance, and modern life to keep you guessing and trying to figure out the big picture before its revealed.  Why some people are rating this book so low is beyond me.  I finished it ahead of my deadline (July 10th when Shadow of Night is released) and am anxiously waiting for the next installment.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is a bestseller?  The mere thought depresses me.  I love to read and quite honestly enjoy most everything that I read, but getting through 500+ pages of this drivel was absolute torture.  The only reason I suffered through to the end was so I could write a review of the whole \\"book.\\"  I can only hope that this review will spare others from the same agony.<br /><br />So where should I start with my critique?<br /><br />The characters were ridiculous!  I don't know which was worse, the simpering 21 year-old never-been-kissed Anastasia Steele who spends half the book crying over a man or the perfect-in-every-way Christian Grey who is a 26 year-old CEO (even though he never seems to do any work)and a gorgeous billionaire who can pilot a helicopter, play the piano, fly a glider, owns his own company and jet, comes from the perfect family, and is endlessly thoughtful and generous.  Oh wait, I take it back, he's not actually perfect.  Poor Christian can't tell a good joke.  These two sound like the type of believable, relatable characters that you would like to read about, right?<br /><br />The writing was laughably horrific!  This 514 page book could have been reduced to 200 if the author had eliminated all the unnecessary words and redundancies.  And she could have elimated another 199 pages if she had eliminated all of the words that didn't contribute to a plot.  This book repeats itself so many times, I was bored to tears.  How many times was Christian described as hot?  How many times did I have to read about his grey eyes and the way his grey slacks hung on his hips?  How many times is Ana going to bite her lip, burst into tears, roll her eyes, or flush or blush any one of a number of reds?  How many times do I have to hear Ana describe her subconscious and her inner goddess as if they were people?  Really?  Who does that?  But I guess there is no need for the reader to like Ana because the author tells us to love her.  After all, Christian just can't resist \\"quirking up his lips\\" at her dozens of time so I guess she must be witty, right?<br /><br />The plot was nonexistent!  Will the 50 shades of plain Ana fall for the gorgeous gazillionaire Greek god with the gigantic penis?  Does a bear poop in the woods?  Of course, she will.  Will he also fall for her?  In real life, heck no!  But in this ridiculous fantasy, yes he does.  Of course, I guess he is into sadism and masochism and wants her to become his submissive.  I know that is supposed to be intriguing.  But since he also follows her around like a hopeless puppy dog and tells her that she can \\"just say no\\" at any time, that isn't really much of a plot point.  Also, I think we are supposed to be intrigued by Christian's mysterious background from ages 0-4.  What could those circular scars on his chest be?  Thank goodness his mother just happens to mention that he didn't have a serious case of chicken pox or I would have thought that was it for sure.  Any semi-intelligent adult is going to guess that they are cigarette burn marks.  And, oh FYI, people are going to remember very little before the age of 4, but of course Christian is no ordinary human.  The only thing I found mildly interesting was the \\"situation\\" that finally caused Christian to leave Ana's side for more than a few seconds, but of course that was never explained.  Want to know why?  Because this book had no end.  Not only did it seem endless as I was reading it, but it literally had no end.  Nothing was resolved.  The ending leaves Ana curled up on her bed crying over her perfect billionnaire boyfriend . . . what else.  So actually, this appears to be one way-too-long story divided into three \\"books.\\"<br /><br />There were so many inaccuracies!  The author is British, but she chose to set her book in Washington State, a place I am doubting she has ever stepped foot in.  By the way, this is only one of many blatant details that seem to be \\"borrowed\\" from the Twilight series.  I've lived in the Pacific Northwest and she brought none of it to life.  No description of relentless rain, rushing rivers, or vivid green trees.  And her use of British terms coming from her American heroine were funny.  Funny peculiar, and not in a good way.<br /><br />File this one under the Ridiculous Teenage Fantasy section and steer clear!  I promise you aren't missing anything no matter how many people have fallen for this drivel.  If I have convinced even one person not to read this, I can feel better about having read this whole \\"book.\\"thwest and she brought none of it to life.  No description of relentless rain, rushing rivers, or vivid green trees.  And her use of British terms coming from her American heroine were funny.  Funny peculiar, and not in a good way.<br /><br />File this one under the Ridiculous Teenage Fantasy section and steer clear!

B0055QYKQO|3.0|This motherboard has had some problems and is now in Revision 1.2.  When looking to buy one, I made sure to look for reviews from people that had gotten the newer board.  Amazon did, so I decided to buy the board here.  Much to my surprise, I got a nice, never openned Rev 1.1 board.<br />Rev 1.1 has a major bios issue and is not one you want to do any overclocking with, as doing so can damage your bios, and make the board unusable (check sum error loop).  Even minor changes can cause it.<br /><br />One can, however, adjust the front side bus speed without any issue.<br /><br />Other that having several scary events, that I was not sure I would get out of, the board actually runs fine.<br /><br />Why buy the board in the first place?  Well Rev 1.2 seems to have solved all it's issues and is a very cost effective board.<br /><br />If you don't plan on doing anything in bios, then Rev 1.1 may work.  However, Rev 1.2 came out in Nov of 2011, so the bios is way out of data and may not work with newer processors.  Had I gotten a 6200 processor, it would not have even booted.<br /><br />Would seem that Amazon needs to work on their inventory management.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game ever!!!!!! I love to play it on the iphone but as soon as I saw it in the app store on the kindle fire I got it right away ! MY NEW FAV GAME!!!!!!!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I came across this series thanks to HBO adaptation. The books, like always are so much better, and Martin's idea of making the story being told from so many points of view is rather interesting, you get a more complete view of what is happening, but at the same time it also maintains a great deal of mistery; I for one would love to have a chapter from Littlefinger's point of view.<br /><br />All of the books are awesome, the one I liked the less was A Feast for Crows, but Martin makes a point by saying that book 5 should be on roughly the same time period of 4, just with different points of view, will have to wait and see.<br /><br />Kindle version is superb, and would only raise 2 comments, one is that the maps don't look as good (due to screen size), and the table of contents only shows the chapter number and not the POV that it has; would be nice to have that.<br /><br />Pricewise, is a nice deal!!
0345803485|2.0|Don't know what all the hype was about. I skipped alot of pages as it became boring. I wont be reading her other two books.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I hate previews, so I had no idea what this book was about.  I found it when I was looking for the second novel in the new trilogy by Jasper Fforde that starts with [[ASIN:0143118587 Shades of Grey: A Novel]] (Which is a great book, by the way.)  I was thinking that it was pretty boring, but I was hoping that maybe it would be better after we found out that Christian was a vampire or an extraterrestrial or whatever.  I guess the \\"Twilight\\" feeling trickling in led me to expect such a revelation about Christian.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I found out his dark little secret!  I didn't even get through the first scene in Christian's boudoir.  I stopped at the whip fashioned out of feathers.  It's not that I'm a prude.  But the whole thing just seemed so boring.<br /><br />I decided I'd  better come to Amazon and read some reviews to see if anything worth reading about was ever going to happen.  Apparently not.  From these reviews, this book is going back to the library unfinished.  Life is too short to waste time reading bad fiction of any type.  The \\"Twilight\\" saga was hard enough to read because it was so slow until the last book.  (Meyer's [[ASIN:0316043044 The Host: A Novel]] was MUCH better.)  But badly written erotica that was originally \\"Twilight\\" fan fiction?  Forget it!
B0086700CM|5.0|I bought this app yesturday nd couldn't stop playing it its a really fun game nd I just love it :)
B000DZIGDU|3.0|Well acted and evocative of the sort of boredom-to-horror transitions Marines endure in the field, this film is interesting but constructed oddly. It mostly consists of a series of events strung together almost like vignettes. They hit all the usual training humiliations on the numbers, but once they are deployed, the sequence of the events is not particularly important for the most part and that element, along with the lead character's fantasizing, which is shown as daydreams that look just like reality but quirkier, make it all seem a little awkward and random. There are amazing visual moments, painful dramatic moments, pragmatic and plebian daily daily moments and great acting all the way through. I just found the lack of cohesion a little off-putting and the ending feels like something that was tacked on a year later: it's so distanced from the rest of the movie that I almost wished I'd shut the film off before that last act. They also don't push the daydreaming far enough--it's almost incidental and not used enough in either advancing the character or creating an escape for him, so it seems unneeded. Funny, but unneeded. Overall, an interesting view but not an earthshaking one.
B005N1E8A4|5.0|I have to say, the show was amazing and I was pulled in from the beginning and became a tried and true fan.  I recommend to anyone! However, I discovered that the Blu-ray discs are labeled wrong.  If you watch the one that says it's the regular Blu-ray, the sound doesn't match her lip movement. That's because it's actually the 3D Blu-ray.  Switch 'em and it's solved.
B0053O89KG|4.0|For some reason everything works on this show. It's not a particularly new premise and the cop procedural is done to death. It even has the same basic weight as Bones but the actors are all so good that it works brilliantly. (I didn't care for the pilot much. They criminally underused Nathan Fillion by only making his character a 2D comic cute cartoon instead of a quirky but fully-dimensional person but everything after that works like crazy so if you're new to this, keep going.) Not least, the supporting cast is remarkably and uniformly great. For characters that speak almost entirely in exposition, the detectives played by Seamus Dever and Jon Huertas are as engaging as the leads. And the leads have the chemistry required to make it all run.<br />One slight side warning that the writing is fantastic up to third season but something changed in fourth, including writing, balance, costumes and music cues, and some of us are less enchanted with season four and up. Just saying. It's still quite easily watchable and very enjoyable.
0385532458|5.0|Book was great.<br />John Grisham is a wonderful author.<br />The storys were very interesting.<br />All should read his books as soon as possible.
B003UYUR10|4.0|I'm not sure why this film was so vilified. If you recognize that it's a Disney movie and a sand and sandal fantasy, you pretty much know what to expect. It's not hugely different from the Mummy films in disregard for historic or cultural accuracy, is just as humorous and anachronistic and even more opulent and visually gorgeous. Maybe it needed to also be a monster film to be accepted? For whatever reason it was hated, I have to say that it's really quite enjoyable on the terms in which it was intended: a modern version of the sort of Sindbad/Sabu movies from the 60s and 70s. Jake Gyllenhaal is so likeable as an actor that his thief-turned-prince is engaging regardless of setting. Gemma Arerton's character is initially as stiff as a board, then a stereotypic haughty priestess and most of the time the actress doesn't rise above the script but she does occasionally make a good impression. She has reasonable chemistry with Gyllenhaal and the banter between the two works just fine in service to the story. The time-slip gimmick, I presume from the video games which I admit I have never played, is interesting and well explored and the entire plot moves along smoothly and ties up well. It's a hundred times better than, say Scorpion King, no more fantastic than any other crazy artifact film (Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull for instance), and it moves through the paces deftly without falling apart or losing track of the story it wants to tell. Supporting cast are excellent.<br />So. Gone into with the correct expectations, there's really nothing wrong with this film. It's all about updating Sinbad for the new generation and anyone who's seen those movies knows it's not about realistic situations and Academy Award level acting. It's a big shiny bauble of a story that sounds like Aladdin and looks like a theme park's version of royal Morocco.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I have been a fan since S1E1. The characters are so richly developed and interesting. I love the interplay between Elena, Damon and Stephan. So much sexual tension going on. Love it. I can't wait to see where season 4 takes us. Waiting on the release of the third season to tide me over.
B004L3AR0K|3.0|Assuming you don't hate Jake Gyllenhaal or Anne Hathaway, this is a very cute romance with quirky characters and snappy dialogue. It has the occasional truly funny moment and an overall enjoyable storyline. Viagra salesman Jamie meets Parkinson's patient Maggie: both are into sport sex only and both refuse to fall in love. Naturally, things don't go quite the way they expect. Within the parameters of Hollywood romance, nothing is particularly surprising but the stops along the way to the inevitable conclusion are entertaining, sometimes hilarious. Jamie's brother, played by Josh Gad, is an especially fantastic bit of character work that gives Jamie's character perspective in the best of ways. The acting is very good from all the cast, the basic story is fairly fresh and new and the handling of Hathaway's character's illness is done right on the line of being realistic enough to have some weight and still be light enough for a fluffy romantic film (ie she's sick but she never looks unattractive even at the worst of it). There are many sex scenes, some quite explicit, but with two such beautiful actors, this is what makes it a good date night movie. They even make the attempt to be honest about Parkinson's, again while staying within the lines of a light comic romance. Worth a watch.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I am a big Walking Dead fan. I got hooked after seeing the pilot episode. I thought the mid-seasom finale was one of the best ever filmed. I w ould have loved to see the look on my own face when........ I won't spoil it for anyone who has not seen it yet. Outstanding. I loved seeing the interplay between Shane, Rick and Lori.
B004XQO90O|4.0|From the same director as Moon, this is a great little compact science fiction movie. Set in modern day but using fantasy science as its gimick, the film takes an Army pilot played by Jake Gyllenhaal and sends him into a momentary world composed of a slice of memory from the victim of a train explosion, in an effort to figure out why the train exploded. The tech is complicated but explained throughout the course of the film well enough to not get in the way of the storyline and the whole is character based. Thankfully, the cast is uniformly great, with Michelle Monaghan (Mission Impossible) as the requisite pretty girl, doing a great job of being more than just a face. Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright also turn in great performances and overall, director Duncan Jones has made another tidy self-contained movie driven by character. The complexity of the science gets a little knotty toward the end but that's the only real flaw and the only reason I didn't give it five stars for intelligent construction and pure enjoyment. Well worth a watch, especially if you liked Duncan Jones' first film Moon. (If you haven't seen Moon, it's also recommended highly for many of the same reasons listed above.)
B006PHD0RW|4.0|this is a puzzle fitting game where you need to learn what will rest on top of each other.  fun game got very challenging.  but the control of things could be better.
0385534639|4.0|Beautiful love story entwined in narratives of a number of other characters.  It was a magical journey!<br />However, I found the ending a bit flat.  Wished it had left me dreaming for more.
B003UESJ9W|5.0|Loved Country Strong at the theater.  Tim McGraw and Gwyneth Paltrow are great together.  Had to have my own copy.
0307592731|4.0|This memoir was written by Cheryl Strayed. As she tells us in the book, Strayed is not her birth name, but rather the name she chose when she and her husband ended their marriage and did not want to keep their hyphenated names.  This book is very much about Ms. Strayed's finding her own identity and figuring out what would make her happy and fulfilled.<br /><br />The author lost her beloved mother die at age 44 from lung cancer and it sent her on a downward spiral of self-pity, depression, and reckless behavior. She ended up cheating on the husband she loved and destroyed her marriage, she ended up losing close touch with her siblings and step-father, and she started an affair with a musician who used heroin and she began to use as well.<br /><br />By making the decision to walk the Pacific Crest Trail - it actually starts in Mexico and ends in Canada, she hiked starting near Mohave in California and ended in Portland - she learns self-reliance and gains an acceptance of herself that was not there before. She is able to finally release the shackles of grief over the loss of her mother and start her life with new confidence and self-awareness.<br /><br />It's pretty amazing to read what she went through. At times no money, no water, and having to walk in extreme heat and cold with improperly fitted shoes. The whole time I was reading this book my feet hurt in empathy.<br /><br />Recommended. It's not something I could do but I felt like I shared a little bit in her experience in the comfort of my own chair.
1469984202|5.0|I purchased the print edition of Wool - Omnibus edition and read it cover to cover. It was very hard to put down once I started reading, but it was especially hard to put down after completing the first 40 pages (Wool 1). I hate the awful feeling I have when a good book is over, so I usually pace myself, but this was a book that I just could not stop reading, even though I wanted it to last much, much longer. I need to order the 6th book (the prequel) just to keep myself involved in this futuristic world a little longer. I will be recommending this to everyone I know. I decided to purchase it by reading all of the amazing reviews this series has received, and once I finished, I knew I needed to write something as well. You will not be disappointed if you purchase this book.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|I built a PC for my church to use for video broadcasting of our Sunday services.  I started off with an Asus M5A97 EVO, 32GB of RAM, a SSD HD for boot-up, a pair of 2TB HDDs and an AMD FX-8120 processor.  I installed Windows 7 pro and had nothing but issues with random blue screens and reboots.  After many hours spent on the issue, the problem turned out to be bad RAM.  I RMA's the memory, received the new set, installed all the DIMMs and things worked better.  A few days later the Asus board died.  It would turn out however it did not POST anymore and had a red cpu LED that was constantly on. Based on reviews I decided to try the GA-990FXA-UD3.  I ordered it with overnight delivery (Thanks Amazon!!).  Received it Saturday afternoon (Lasership).  I immediately swapped it out, 20 minutes later, everything worked like magic even from the first try.  I update Windows 7 with all the necessary drivers and to ensure that things are stable, I flashed the BIOS to the latest version F7.  Things have been very very stable.  This is a rock-solid system board that I highly recommend.  Going forward, I am going to buy Gigabyte only and never an Asus board.  This is the best board for the money, it's fully loaded and is an awesome board.  I wish I started with it than the Asus board. Thank you Amazon for carrying this board.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Okay, I think the Skynet edition labeling is a little silly, but the entire premise of the movie of course is a bit odd. It's a movie.<br /><br />And it's one of the best ever made.<br /><br />This should be a core part of any blu-ray collection - part family drama, part science fiction, part action, part dated jokes and references, part anti-corporate warning.<br /><br />Please stop reading reviews and go watch it. On Blu-ray. With your friends and family, or all by yourself. Both are great.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Don't judge a book by it's cover (or Title).<br />Like for many others this was an Amazon recommendation.<br />Although it wasn't expensive I tried the Kindle sample first and was completely hooked by the story and purchased the omnibus. Thanks to the Author for a fantastic vision.<br />I can only suggest that if you like a great story with well-realized characters try WOOL - regardless of genre - you'll be glad that you did.
B005OR9MJY|1.0|I was thinking that HTML 5 would be something new and exciting.  And it may be at the deeper end of it where you work with some of the more difficult technologies.  But this book is really written for someone who would be better served with just a basic HTML tutorial.  They cover the new tags like &lt;header> &lt;footer> and &lt;article>, but not much about how to make the video stuff work.  And at the level they are covering it, an old HTML hand would just use classes and IDs.<br /><br />They don't have much to say, and they say it at excessive length.
0345803485|4.0|Well written book. Hot, erotic, fun roller coaster ride. Just disappointed that they made the lead character flawed because of child abuse.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was curious from all the hype/reviews on this book.  I hope young girls that read this book realize that it is fiction and the writer's \\"fantasy\\"...control like this can be deadly.

B007MJ9LA2|2.0|I was excited to get this new album. But not having the option to listen to samples of the cd before you buy, made me purchase an album I would not have bought if I could listen to some tracks beforehand. I love classic Santana, (the first 3 albums.) There was a period (late 70s and 80s) where he drifted off a little and went more pop. However I really liked the Supernatural album, Shaman was good, and All that I am was really good. I was expecting more of the same here. WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!! Being a musician myself, I respect his decision to do what he wants. As a fan I was disappointed. Listening to the first song, was ok. When I got to the second song it sounded like it was still the first song, so i fast forwarded to track 3, then track 4, then track 5,............. The whole cd sounded like the same song, same tempo, same solo, same thing. I believe there is only 1 track with vocals, but it isnt worth listening to. So I will probably never listen to this cd again. Looking at the other reviews, it seems most have the same opinion. I have to agree with another review. Santana's tone has changed over the years, due to different instruments and recording processes. This album has to much bass in the guitar tone. Classic Santana has the edge that made him famuous. If you can listen to some tracks before you buy, please do. I think it will let you know if you relly want to buy the album or not. I would not of bought it, if I could of listened to some tracks before hand............

B00127RAJY|4.0|This is by far the best workout DVD I've ever purchased.  And for less than $10, you can't beat it!  I love that it is only 20 minutes, and I feel like I get a good workout.  I've been brave and done level 1 two times back to back before, and that wipes me out.  I'm definitely a beginner....I feel successful at level 1, but level 2 is a bit too much upper body for me right now.  I do have bad knees, and I have to be careful with some of the exercises....but all in all, I highly recommend this!

B005LAIHIQ|1.0|We went to see this on the first Saturday night.  8 pm showing.  It had only been open one day.  There was a hugh line to get into the multiplex theater.  Shock.  Most were  going to see \\"The Avengers.\\"  There were maybe 20 other people in the theater with us to see this mess.  I am a big fan of the TV show, both old and new.  I was about 9 or 10 when the original was on.  This was a travisty.  Why does Burton keep going to old movies / TV shows and mess them up?  This was worse then Charlie and the Choclate factory, which I hated.  The film starts out fine,  gothic, horror, romantic.  I had high hopes for it, thinking it would stick to the original, then, like the crashing of the waves on the rocks, Johnny Depp comes in as Barnabis, now a vampire,  looking like some freaked out reject from Halloween.  After that it is  all down hill.  It switched from gothic, to horror, to satire then , in the end, did a total \\"Twilight\\"  camp fight/ fest.  By then I was totally lost and was wanting to go home and watch my DVDs of the remake with Ben Cross, (Which I like very much).  I wouldnt even watch this agian for free on netflix.
B0086700CM|5.0|The flood is you have variety.  It's not just a game with no real goal.  You can earn coins for power ups and new characters and what not.<br />It is a little wonky on my kindle though, a stylus helps some.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game and its easy to learn points I love it. love it love it love it love it love it
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Let me just say that using this product was really quite nerve racking, as I had never replaced thermal compound before. But I will tell you; it couldn't have been easier. And this compound only made it even better.<br /><br />My system used to idle at around 90F. Immediately after replacing my compound with Arctic Silver, my idle temps were in the low 80s, and now stay at about 79F. That in itself makes this well worth the seven dollars asked for it. I couldn't be more pleased.
B00729GQ0A|1.0|I forced myself to get half way through this book. As another review said, the plot is so much like Twilight - minus all the romance. This book is just dumb - and the story is disjointed. It jumps around in time - I mean the relationship was never developed - the author just fast forwarded in time.<br />Too much talk of religion and no plot of interest. I just could not bear it even for the low price.
B000067QMD|5.0|I pump into Avent bottles at work, so I purchased these for transport. These are very durable and clean easily. When you buy the Avent bottles, these are NOT included. I honestly don't even pop these out before cleaning the screw-on caps that these insert into, because they clean really well as one unit. Once baby no longer feeds from bottles, these discs will be great to transport food when we're on the go or otherwise traveling.
B006ZZANG0|4.0|Rufus Wainwright's best material is the stuff of dreams.  This is not among his best albums, but is, however, still very good and excellently produced by Mark Ronson.<br /><br />To give context to my own tastes, I would rate \\"All Days Are Nights: Songs For Lulu\\", \\"Want Two\\", and \\"Poses\\" amongst his best endeavours (five stars), each providing the best examples of his songwriting and musicianship/composition in very different ways and stages of his career.  \\"Out of the Game\\" is a solid release and more mature, which doesn't dwell on the extremes of production as some of his other albums like \\"Want One\\" (a dramatic increase in scope of songwriting and instrumentation, teetering on over-production) or \\"All Days Are Nights [...]\\" (very sparse in contrast to earlier work).  The production, arrangements and instrumentation complement the inherent songwriting ideally, though the songwriting itself isn't Wainwright's strongest (but still good).  Even sub-par songwriting for Rufus Wainwright is better than most.<br /><br />I've not been compelled to keep this playing on repeat like the aforementioned triumvirate of albums, but I am keeping this in the disc rotation for a while.
0385751532|5.0|This was a book I hadn't known much about but when a group of students suggested it to me, I decided to read it.  Afterwards, I was embarrassed at having let this book pass me by.  This is one of the best novels I've read in awhile.<br /><br />Of course, calling it a novel may be a bit of stretch.  I would agree with Mr. Boyne's calling it a fable.  Not that that diminishes it in any way.  Whatever you want to label it, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is an incredibly powerful story and Mr. Boyne deserves to be congratulated on producing it.<br /><br />Why call it a fable?  A beautifully unaware protagonist and a clearly delivered moral.  Bruno, the 9-year-old through whose eyes we see most of the story, maintains a heart-breaking innocence throughout the tale to the bitter end, even as the reader becomes more and more aware of the horrible situation that surrounds him.  His transformation of misunderstood words--\\"Out-With\\" and \\"Fury\\" being the main examples--highlights the reader's awareness as it reflects both Bruno's ignorance of the superficial as well as his understanding of the deeper nature of his experience.  He knows good and bad, whatever its name is.<br /><br />There is also fable-making in the amazing coincidence of Shmuel.  His sharing the exact birthday as Bruno.  Their striking resemblance.  Their mutual innocence even as Shmuel lives in the camp.  Normally this would push belief but, in this case, makes Shmuel a reflection of Bruno and brings the moral of the fable closer to home.<br /><br />Though Bruno remains the only fully realized character in the story, through his filter the reader experiences scene after powerful scene with the other characters as ciphers on a stage, ciphers that can represent larger ideas as their reality remains vague.  The overpowering father figure, the self-involved mother, the \\"Hopeless case\\" sister, the mean soldier, the camp prisoner who acts as butler, the fuehrer and his companion, each has a scene or two with Bruno whose observations open our eyes.<br /><br />The end of the story is, expectedly, tragic.  Well-foreshadowed, it is still almost unexpected in the \\"banality\\" of its horror.  It is hard not to shed tears over, especially for a parent of young children, but, unlike some stories, they are tears the author has earned.  I have already come back and read parts of this book over and over again.  Anyone who has yet to read it would be well advised to do so.whose observations open our eyes.<br /><br />The end of the story is, expectedly, tragic.

0345803507|3.0|I think the first 2/3 of the book was so unnecessary. It feel like the repeat of book two except instead of figuring out their relationship as a new couple, it is figuring out their still relatively new relationship but as a married couple. That said, I started to read to book just finish it and was happily surprised with the plot turn in the last 1/3 or 1/4 of the book. Ana's old boss makes a reappearance and is the catalyst for overcoming their slow relationship progress to the happy couple riding off into the sunset. That said, I find the very, very last section unnecessary and confusing - SPOILER ALERT ... why do we need to tell a small part of the story from Christian's point of view?? It doesn't really add anything to the story.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game great everybody should have it I'm addicted to it best game ever my little brother even likes it
0345803485|5.0|I decided to buy all 3 books but as i'm reading the trilogy, i realize i wouldn't rate each book 5 stars and therefore the overall story told in the trilogy 5 stars. I had that expectation given most recently reading The Hunger Games. But back to this book's review: This book is quite naughty making me blush many a times while also giving me a nice romance that i could appreciate without puking up White Knights. As for the characters, thank goodness E.L gave small pockets of humanity to Christian Grey otherwise i'm not sure if i could've continued reading the trilogy. I also like a strong female and another reason why i've not read romance novels before - can't deal with helpless females. Ana was not as strong as I would've liked but fitting for the character that E.L. created. Her strength does come across much more in the rest of the trilogy.<br /><br />My only negative for the book & triology is E.L's use of the word 'mutter' - perhaps it is the difference of British English but i wasn't fond of all the 'muttering' in the book done by everyone.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is by far my face game on the kindle. It is so addictive and I can not stop playing it. It is the best game and so much fun.
0345803493|5.0|Really enjoyed book 2 of the triology as it was about them figuring out their relationship. The sex scenes are getting old as the book progresses...they have sex and orgasims a lot, blah, blah, blah. I do like how Ana's character is so strong both in trying not letting Christian run her over as well as how she handles her boss. After reading the entire triology, i wished it would've ended with this book. The suspense drama person I am got hooked into the reading the third book because of the last page and which i had known that and just not read the last page.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never read a BDSM book before.  This book in fact the entire series is about love and the struggles that go along with it.  I was glued to the pages and couldn't put it down.  In fact, I didn't sleep the first night I started the book because I was so hooked.  This book is not for teenagers.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this book and the series.
1558908323|5.0|Excellent for a classic 90s film like this sci-fi movie. Sincere, straightforward and exciting to watch even at home TV. Characters are good too.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|I just put in my copy of the DVD and figure I'll spend the whole day sharing memories with these guys.  You have GOT to get the DVD.  With Robin's passing, it's even sadder to watch him perform.  The tears flow when they do the song for Andy.  I look at Robin and realize he knew nothing of what lay ahead for him, as none of us do.<br />They truly were a great group that was in the wrong time.  I loved them from the start but, if they had their Band hit now in today's world, they would have been even more overwhelmed with fans.Their songs have more meaning today, the words MEAN something.  As another reviewer said....listen to the words.  They send out emotion, feelings, sadness, happiness and, even with loss, the true meaning of life goes on and that being Love.<br />We know not what tomorrow holds for us so, for today, live life and FEEL every minute of it.  As Barry is singing now, you feel love, show it.<br />I will always miss each of them....Barry, you could put your shoes under my bed any night.

B005LAIGWS|5.0|JUst like some of the other reviewers have said,if you are looking for a sequel to the first one look elsewhere.Now if you approach this as a whole new story about the origin of Ghost Rider you will not be disappointed(though longtime fans will remember the reference to the angels in the movie).The movie is thoroughly enjoyable from this perspective and is able to stand on its own.Some of the acting is cheesy(Cage towards the end of the movie in particular)but this does not make the movie a bad watch.Overall it does at the very least deserve a rental and then make your own decision.As a longtime fan of the rider i enjoyed this one more than the first.It actually feels more like the comics where Ghost Rider was after something and didn't care who or what was in his way.
B0038W0OHQ|5.0|I've been using these headphones for three weeks.  Sound fidelity is great with both games and music.  The interchangeable pads work well and I appreciate the included extension cable.  Steelseries has produced a winner, with braided cables and other thoughtful design elements.  I'm going to look favorably on any other Steelseries products in the future.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a fantastic game, but it just seems to be missing... something that the original had. the only diff I can tell from the ios version is that the sound for the coin pickup seems slightly off. could be just me. not sure if it would've had the same addictive appeal as the original. otherwise, fantastic game easy to play,  hard to master
1439153663|5.0|This book transported me. I almost did not read the book. I am so glad I did. This is one of those rare books that you lose yourself in. I was a bit bereft when I finished. I loved the characters and the story so much. The characters stayed with me all day. I couldn't let go of them right away. One of those rare reads that satisfies everything readers love about reading.

0316776963|5.0|What is there to say? If you like David Sedaris, you'll like this book. I first discovered him many moons ago, the first time he read \\"Santa Land Diaries\\" on public radio's \\"This American Life\\". When it was re-broadcast I recorded it, and I still have that cassette tape. Played that for my daughter, who then read the story. She knows it by heart. I even photocopied that story from the book \\"Barrel Fever\\" and used it in a high school English class I was teaching.<br />When I recently noticed that \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is the only Sedaris book we do not own, so I got a paperback on Amazon, then noticed a hard cover 1st edition that had been in my \\"save for later\\" basket and immediately got that as well at its original, much lower price, which had been saved in my basket. (Discovered on arrival that the book itself is 1st edition, but the dust cover is new -- but it doesn't matter, as I'm not a \\"collector\\". Both are in mint condition. This was in great condition too.)<br />This is not the only Sedaris book of which we have two copies, either on purpose or by accident. They're worth having, giving, lending.<br />Then, after buying this one and looking it over briefly, I realized I had read it before. Must have taken it out of the library many years ago. But it's just as good now as before. Maybe better.<br />Hey, what else is there to say? If you like David Sedaris' stories and essays you will enjoy this book. 20 years ago, listening to audio tapes of a different one in the car (Sedaris reading, of course), during one story we had to pull over to the side of the road because I was laughing so hard. Seriously.<br />I encourage all who read this review (what a ridiculous thing to write -- a REVIEW!) to buy this and his other books as well. You will love them.<br />And I hope his father, Lou, is reading this, as he calculates the grains of sand on the beach with a stick and many equations. (Inside joke -- you have to read the book.)
1451627289|5.0|11/22/63, by Stephen King, is an engaging and entertaining book. It is well written, and even though it is long, it never seems to drag- you never wonder WHEN will this END?!?! It is very hard to put down, so be prepared to dive in and not come up for air for a while!

B007C3TVEY|5.0|A powerful and disquieting film, \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" jumps back and forth in time as it gradually tells the story of a family with a sociopathic son Kevin, the impact of his actions has on the survivor and in the wake of a horrible tragedy. The cast is marvelous with strong performances from Tilda Swindon as Eva Kevin's mother who never truly bonds with her son and John C. Reilly as Kevin's father who can only see the good in his son.<br /><br />I will admit, of course, that I'm a bit biased when it regards this material with a family member who suffers from much of the same disorder as Kevin does although the outcome was not as tragic.<br /><br />Director/co-writer Lynne Ramsey does a marvelous job with realizing the characters from Lionel Shriver's novel and helping her cast create realistic and tragic characters.<br /><br />The Blu-ray receives an exceptionally good transfer nicely capturing the natural looking cinematography  handled by Seamus McGarvey. Detail and color remains strong throughout the presentation of the film. If you just want to watch the film in standard DVD I don't think it'll suffer but the Blu has superior depth, detail and color reproduction.<br /><br />Audio has a nice, subtle surround mix that gradual envelopes the listener but keep in mind that this is a dialogue driven movie.<br /><br />The special features a featurette \\"Behind the Scenes of Kevin\\" where the cast and crew get a chance to discuss the material and their approach to it. We also get some additional footage from the opening sequence at the tomato festival in Spain as well as an interview with actress Swindow from Telluride.<br /><br />A disturbing but powerful drama driven by a number of great performances including Erza Miller as the teenage Kevin (although to all the actors who portray him--to their credit they are all great in their performances)and Tilda Swindon as his mother, \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" isn't a feel good movie but sometimes we need films like this to remind us of tragedy that sometimes embraces our lives without ever letting go.this to remind us of tragedy that sometimes embraces our lives without ever letting go.

B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Dawson Cole is a loveable enough character.  He is from the wrong side of the tracks and has every chance to turn out like the rest of his family, but in spite of it all he gets out of Oriental, a small southern town, and becomes a derrick hand on an oil rig.  We see flashbacks to when he first met Amanda Collier in high school, their early romance over the summer of their junior year, and how they became very close during their senior year, in 1984. SO that she can have her dreams he breaks things off, but never really lets go of her memory.  When Tuck Hostetler, their common connection to the town, dies (you know someone has to die... it is a N. Sparks novel) they are both summoned back to town by the estate lawyer.  The book centers around them spending the weekend reminising about their school days crush and the memorial for Tuck.  There is plenty of intrigue from Dawson's kin and the story of Tuck's life as it is revealed.  But I have to admit the story was good but I did not care for the premise of a single man and a married woman.  I have read all of N. Sparks' books with the exception of the vacation blog with his brother and this one if one of his better stories.  I just wish I was not cringing over her being married through most of the book.<br /><br />Also note: there is a typo on my book .. page 101, line three, the word \\"they\\" is left out.  Yep I am OCD and I just had to throw that in (but please do not check my spelling as I can not spell to save my life)  :)

0307730697|5.0|Author Eric Blehm has done a magnificent job of telling about the life of Adam Brown of Navy Seal Team Six. What really makes this book so interesting is that the story does just not detail the exploits of the Navy Seals but looks in detail into one of their most outstanding men. We learn about Adam Brown as a young man growing up and many of the challenges and difficulties he faced. His family moved around the U.S. as his father sought work wherever he could find it. In spite of these many changes, Adam always adapted, made friends and was a devoted son. Unfortunately in later years he got caught up in drugs and it almost ruined his life. Yet, he got beyond it and then decided he wanted to join the Navy and become a Navy Seal. The story then details his incredible training, injuries and his eventual meeting and marrying the love of his life. Then the story takes us into his various deployments around the world. Often times he suffered injury that would take most men out of the Navy. Not Adam! No matter what happened, he always seemed to overcome it and move on. He was an incredible leader and loved and respected by all those with whom he served. His life also took on a spiritual dimension as both he, his wife and parents devoted their lives to the Lord. He carried a Bible with him and prayed regularly. He was not bashful about sharing his faith and prayed often with other Seal members. Later in his marriage he and his wife had two children and Adam was a remarkable father and couldn't wait to love up on those children each time he returned from a mission. Like so many others of our brave men, Adam met his last challenge in Afghanistan and his life was lost. The final part of the book is the tribute paid to him by his comrades, family and friends. His life was so inspirational and he touched so many in a positive way that you'll come away with thanks for such a great man who served our country so gallantly. I guarantee you'll be deeply touched by this story.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|I am one of those that didn't find this book riveting.  I was actually bored after the first 200 pages or so.  The lengthy descriptions of places, things and people was irritating.  There were too many characters to keep up with.<br /><br />I was disappointed by how inept (when it comes to people, tactics and politics) a great warrior as Lord Stark turned out to be, I expected much more from what seemed like a strong character.<br /><br />My reading ends with this book.
1451648537|4.0|On the positive side, the book paints a vivid portrait of a borderline autistic person who certainly lived an extraordinary life. The book moves along at a lively pace, and I always found it engaging.<br /><br />On the negative side, I believe that the author mishandled the topic of Steve's diet. My objections:<br />(1) He places dietary practices well-supported by modern nutrition science (such as veganism) in the same bucket as some of Steve's wackier (and dangerous) practices, such as single-food diets.<br />(2) He uses the term 'animal protein' as if amino acids derived from animal sources are somehow superior to those derived from plant sources, and repeats the widely held myth that vegans are at risk for protein deficiency.<br />(3) He apparently never directly asked Steve why he (often) followed a vegan diet, leaving us to guess that it was due to spiritual influences (Buddhism), which is actually one of the poorest reasons for pursuing such a diet.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't say how this book was, but the reviews make me feel like I really need to be reading this!! On my way now!
B0086700CM|5.0|i absolutly love temple run. It is so much better on my Kindle Fire, than on my ipod touch. I would reccomend this app because you can play it almost anywhere
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game its awesome. The person who made this game should make another one but better. This game is so Legit.
B002ZG976U|3.0|I have always been a big fan of Cher. She is one of those rare singers who, when crossing over to the movies, manages to make very high quality movies (although curiously she doesn't often sing in them). Burlesque, despite Cher's top billing, is definitely Christina's movie. I did enjoy the music, but I think I'll skip purchasing the soundtrack seeing how Cher only sang 2 songs.<br /><br />The music was good. The costumes were great. The dancing was good (I may have enjoyed that better if I were a horny guy?). I liked the movie, I really did, but this just wasn't up to the quality of most of the stuff Cher does. And then I have to admit musicals aren't exactly my thing. I like some of the older ones, like Mary Poppins. And don't attack me, but I actually liked Burlesque better than some of the more recent ones like Chicago or Moulin Rouge! (I did enjoy Chicago on Broadway, however.)<br /><br />I guess it was the lack of a plot. Not that that's unusual for a musical. They put that thing in the background about Cher's character worrying about losing her club, but that was overshadowed by everything else. And it was resolved very oddly. And the romance was predictable. I will definitely watch the movie again, however, because it was still a lot of fun, with a lot to see.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|It is a pretty well designed device.  There are a lot of adjustments you can make to have it match up to probably any bottle size or shape (round of course).  It can be a little tricky to figure out at first though.  Its really important to apply an even pressure with the cutter as you spin the bottle.  I've found I almost always have a gap in the score when I make the first spin of the bottle, then have to reset my hand, and go again.  It would be nice if there was some sort of a strap or roller or something to help with applying even pressure.  It does seem to be getting better with practice though.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. it is so addictive. I've not had any technical issues with this on my kindle fire, it runs wonderfully. everyone should definitely get this!
0307592731|1.0|This book was not what it purported to be. It was primarily a \\"whine session.\\" It also contained extremely filthy language. If I had known that before purchasing, I would certainly not have done so. I would NOT recommend this book.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I'm a big fan of nonograms but most of the apps for Android leave an awful lot to be desired. This app is IMHO the best out there. It has a good ui (both very attractive and very usable... Zoom function works well for the bigger puzzles and can really help to minimize problems with tapping the wrong box by accident). There are a ton of puzzles (and they are actually good puzzles that make recognizable pictures... NOT just random patterns OR all predictably symmetrical patterns like so many other apps). The developer releases frequent updates with additional puzzles and the occasional bug fix, and I have yet to experience any stability issues AT ALL (Droid Razr). The puzzles range from small and easy to huge and very difficult, and are generally well categorized so you can be reasonably assured that you will be able to progress as you work through the levels and only occasionally get really stuck with a puzzle that is significantly harder than the other ones in that difficulty level (and you can always skip such puzzles and come back to them so it's not a big deal to get stuck on one now and then). All in all this is a solid app and a lot of fun... HOURS and HOURS worth of puzzling entertainment.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read the first book in the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy.  I will not be wasting my time on book 2 and 3.  It was poorly written and, frankly, I have no use in reading about some poor kid being beaten by a control freak!
B0086700CM|5.0|I downloaded it thinking I will just uninstall it instead I can't put it down its in my favs so get it today but don't get the lost city it is plan out boring it is not worth a doller get this app instead.
B005T87QCI|1.0|don't buy this it keeps crashing on me right after the intro so its pretty dumb and stop buying this app
B0058VW36U|5.0|cut the rope is awesome you can go through many levels and boxes I love to play this game on car rides plus you don't need wick get this app!!!!
B007G51UV0|4.0|Great Motherboard, I bought it above others SPECIFICALLY for the WI_FI GO feature.. Sadly the onboard WIFI that plugs in was /is defective.. The idiots at tech support want me to RMA whole board.. It is a little piece as big as a silver dollar that is defective.. They want me to disassemble my H2O cooled system and send the whole board and be computerless for WEEKS, for a little piece.. RIDICULAS, and the 5 hrs spent getting to that point RUINED IT all for me.. 4 stars is GENEROUS.. great board, VERY silly tech support, with little common sense and piss poor customer support..
B00845PV16|3.0|I'll give it 3 stars just because I love the Ghost Rider character in general but these movies have been such a let down. They have SO much potential with all the cool story lines from the comics and how cool Ghost Rider is in general but the movies are plain and simple a flop... so disappointing as I feel they have the potential to be one of the best comic book movies out there. I was hoping the first movie was just a character build up and that the second one would hit the mark but it fails even bigger. Nicholas Cage should be ashamed to call himself an actor... felt like I was watching a C rated movie if there was such a thing.. I'm actually not sure what I actually just watched to be honest.<br /><br />Get a new cast, a new director and please make Ghost Rider the way it should be... done right.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The story was okay, but for all the hib the books received, I found them lacking.  If you \\"love\\" to read about couples having lots of kinky sex, then these books are for you, or if you want to know about the latest sex toys, then for sure read these books.
B0013TTK9E|5.0|Well, I don't get the low reviews on this book but whatever.  I loved it.  I admit that I would not have read it if it was not highly recommended on the goodreads group that I am in.  I am glad that I read it because if I didn't I would have missed out on reading Persuasion through Captain Wentworth's eyes.  It made me love the Captain even more.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Helps pass the time. It is a good game especially since it was free. I like it and my kids really enjoy this game.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|This movie was terrible. If you like European films, this is for you. If you like to walk away from a movie not feeling like crap, it's not for you.
0439023483|5.0|This was recommended by a friend so I bought it.  When I was close to the end of it I started getting anxious because I would be 1) without a book and 2) wondering what was in the next book  so I went out and bought the next two.  Couldn't put those down either.  I stayed up until 12:30 last night then woke up at 6:30 this morning to finish the last one.  The ending was fine with me and I thought it finished up the story in a good, complete way.  I was satisfied.  It had me thinking about politics, wars, loyalties, how fortunate I am to be living in the U.S., etc.  Very compelling.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This movie is obviously a must have for any Potter-fanatic. The price was amazing, we just couldn't pass it up. The movie is obviously amazing.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I play this app when my kids are too loud and crazy and I start to feel my brain cells are depleted. It helps me relax a bit and feel kind of smart again.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Lots of ads, but games keep you busy. Very simplistic graphics, reminds me of old atari types. Fun to try to get more &quot;coins&quot; to unlock new games rather than having to really purchase add on for games.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so happy they created this game for the kindle!! I absolutely love it and it has a high quality too as a bonus!
0345803485|5.0|I am not usually into reading romance or erotic anything. I typically read biographies and non-fiction crime. I am a 24 year old female and I must say this is unlike any book series I have ever read. I just couldn't put it down. This is the best set of books I have ever read. And yes, the author is a little over zealous and repetitive at times but it doesn't change the amazing story behind all the sex. I don't know many females that don't love the thought of saving someone and helping them see the best side of themselves. It's a fantasy which is why this is a fiction book. If it was based on anything real she wouldnt be having an orgasim every 5 seconds and he wouldn't be a young beautiful, perfect billionaire. However, it is and as far as any fiction love story goes this book is simply the best! Even with all the outlandish sex!:)
B0055SWM08|4.0|nice game. good graphics. soothing sounds. I like the rain drops. got it on free app of the day, but don't like to rate them that same day.
B002L4QP0M|5.0|A lot of books have slow spots, or sections where the action is intense but completely unlikely. This book was written in a way that held your attention with drama and energy, with all of it being quite believable. This is the first Jeffrey Archer book I read. I read a lot of Cussler, Clancy, and similar. I recommend it to others that like spy/assassin/military style stories.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I purchased the book based upon not having read a Baldacci book for a while. As soon as I got into the book, I experienced the Lee Child / Reacher comparison and then went to the reviews, seeing that it was often in the comments. Having read all of Lee Child's books, I was uncertain about continuing but decided to go ahead and finish the book.<br /><br />I actually enjoyed the character much more than Jack Reacher of late. John Puller had more personality, not as morose/angry as Reacher and had a very appealing side to him - somewhat like Sean Drummond. The plot held my attention and overall, I was very pleasantly surprised. John Puller ended up being his own man - unlike all the other genre characters and I found him fascinating. He's someone you could actually know and like.<br /><br />I think this book will have me buying more Baldacci. I especially liked how the plot revealed. Masterful.  I hope we see this character in future novels.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is TOTALLY worth it! I am so addicted to this game!!!!My friends even get annoyed at me for playing it while their talking to me! This is definetley a must play app!!!
0743457900|3.0|Despite my willingness to read almost anything, I haven't really ever read much in the spy genre.  The closest I come is usually something on the mystery front, cuz sometimes there's some spying involved there.  However, I saw the movie Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy when it was out over the winter, and decided I would like to read the book because I enjoyed the movie so much.<br /><br />There were parts of the movie that were kind of confusing to me, this is a convoluted plot and due to the length of the book, some bits got lost in translation.  I was really happy to have a lot of that cleared up through reading the book, and the semi familiarity with the plot also made it easier to understand pieces of the book.  So that in itself makes this a great movie adaptation, in my world.<br /><br />I think the message I got out of this story is that the life of a spy is both dangerous and confusing.  We already know the missions are dangerous and you can't trust people in the field, and it's a little disheartening to realize you can't exactly trust people at home either.  When all of your superiors and colleagues are suspects, where can you really turn?<br /><br />This was also a good ensemble cast - we focus on a variety of characters, even though George Smiley is a well known guy among the works of this author.  I like this approach to the story, because we get the chance to grow to like a variety of people, not just Smiley, and it also doesn't depend on having prior knowledge of that particular character.<br /><br />Since I had seen the movie, I already knew who the mole was, so this was more of a watching and waiting kind of situation for me.  I still found it interesting to see the process they went through to eventually figure out who the villain is, and some of the things that I didn't understand in the movie made a lot more sense when I read how it all played out.<br /><br />I liked this introduction to John le Carre, and I bet I'll be reading something else of his in the future.  Smiley is a likeable hero and that in itself provides motivation to learn more about him!the future.  Smiley is a likeable hero and that in itself provides motivation to learn more about him!
B005L38QHA|2.0|Well it's pretty and the ergonomic shape feels really good in my hand.  I also like that it doesn't feel as though it is made of cheap plastic (one of the issues I have with the Cataclysm edition mouse.  Unfortunately this is not a good replacement for my Cata mouse, which seems to short out sometimes (in game settings I just untic & retic the check box for it to recognize the cata mouse.  This mouse could be great if it didn't eliminate the three buttons on the cata mouse that I use most.  I might be willing to more adapt the the more cramped hand style if it had all my buttons - unfortunately the fact that it is an optical not laser mouse makes much more of a difference than I ever thought.  I can hardly move with this, which makes pvp nearly impossible.  I've tried it on different surfaces and movement is jumpy at best.  As for games outside WoW?  I tried it in Diablo 3 and it's just unplayable.  Period.  Guess I have to replace cata with cata because this is far from legendary.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is addicting and bloody fun. I love it. :D I wish there were a way to win, but I guess it is more fun knowing that the game is never truly over. So, I love the challenge.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I've got all of Mayer's CD's and also his DVD's.  His latest effort Born & Raised might just be my most favorite yet.  It definitely has a throw-back vibe.  It's easy to listen to and after a few times through the songs really stick with you.  There are shades of CSNY & even the Allman Brothers, but done John Mayer style.  It's great road music.<br />Moving out of NYC seems to really agree with Mayer - he's definitely getting better with age.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|game is adicting just wish u didn't have to play the same games so many times just to get enough points to unlock another one I guess that's what makes it adicting
