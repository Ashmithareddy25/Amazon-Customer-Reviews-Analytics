0765342294|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of scifi, but I absolutely couldn't put this book down!<br />Alittle surprised by the bad language coming from &#34;kids&#34;, but other than that, it was great.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really like everything about this game.&hellip;except only having  5 lives. seriously? spoils the flow of the game. should be unlimited play like all other match 3 games. what is the purpose of this? does anyone know?
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried.  I laughed.  I was love smitten.  It has everything and will definitely pull at your heart strings.  It's a great book on cancer victims, but definitely not an in-you-face, feel-sorry-for-me type book.  and for those that want to steer clear- there is alot of language and teenage sex ideology that is contained.
0316010669|5.0|I'm a recent Gladwell fan, having spent the last two weeks devouring all his books in print. While it is true that, read back to back, there is a striking similarity in approach, theme and content: questioning perception and using science and research to re-evaluate and take a deeper look at what's going on, I think this is generally great. Gladwell has an uncommon perspective - which is useful in itself - and uncommon patience at bringing depth to that perspective. I recommend all his books to anyone who wants to become more aware of another way of seeing things.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|But it seems like it just didn't live up to the bourne series. though Jeremy was good, as was Rachael, it just didn't have that &#34;Bourne quality&#34; to it. Worth watching though.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|After reading this novel once it made me want to go back and reread it to see what clues I had missed for the surprising ending.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|the plot is semi-okay, but the script writers shouldn't have been let anywhere near the script. They really messed up what could have been a pretty interesting storyline, and the acting just plain sucked, except for &#34;david&#34; the robot, by Micheal Fassbender.<br /><br />He was great. The way the crew regarded David as a &#34;crew hand&#34; and not a state of the art robot was inexcusable. Lindelohf sucks as a writer.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|The series is very creative and provokes some deep thought at times.  Other times you just cannot believe that the concept of that episode  is any where near something that could happen.<br /><br />The cast is good and the overall quality is good.  It is clearly better than what you can view on T V.<br /><br />If you are from Boston  like I am ... it has additional appeal ... being filmed in Boston it keeps you looking for familiar places.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|Not as epic as the LOTR trilogy, but the 2nd movie seems to be promising. They excluded a lot of the books rendition. It was almost like a different story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome! I have so much fun playing it and it is a great time passer. You have to control your character with th your fingers. It is pretty simple but it gets more difficult the longer you play. The theme changes every month. Right now it is halloween themed in New Orleans. Last month it was Paris. They also give you lots of characters to choose from, and there is a new character available every month that comes with every theme. But first you have to get enough coins to g err them. Overall, it is the best app on my kindle, and probably my best buy. And it's free!
B005LAII3A|5.0|Much better than the 1st. Collin Farrel, Jessica Biel, and Kate Beckinsale give their best in this movie. The set looks like something Ridley Scott would direct. Very detailed world. Once the movie gets going, it's no-stop quality acting and action.

B0023SDPS6|5.0|Craig Johnson provides a glimpse into a particular slice of Wyoming.  He does it with humor, with wit, and with characters who are both realistic and endearing.  I laughed out loud more while reading this novel than I have with any other book in a very long time.  It's not a comedy--far from it--but the characters felt like old friends.  That may say more about my friends than it says about this novel, but if you can appreciate that Wyoming is not the city and that people in small towns don't behave like people in New York City, L.A., or Miami--if you can appreciate that they move at a different and often understated pace--then you could find this novel as delightful as I did.<br /><br />Having said that, I caution readers who love the TV show and who are looking for a novel where the characters look and act just like they did on TV.  I caution folks who love reading about larger-than-life, ultra-perfect characters who get into an extended fight scene in every other chapter.  I caution anyone who is easily offended by language or adult situations.<br /><br />The Cold Dish is not a happy book.  It's not a novel about a main character who's free of faults.<br /><br />It is a mystery novel, but only in the sense that most readers won't know who the killer is until the last chapter.  It is a police procedural, but not one where the main character is consumed entirely by the mystery and thinks not a whit about anything outside that narrow focus.  It's a story about a man in a tough situation who deals with it the best he can but not as well as he thinks he should.  The story is told through a particular viewpoint and that viewpoint has a personality.  If you like that personality, chances are extremely good that you'll like the book--and vice-versa.  I strongly recommend you read the first page or two of the novel before you buy the book.<br /><br />For me, the best parts of this novel are the characters and the depiction of life in small-town Wyoming.  I grew up about three hours from Wyoming and have lived in small towns most of my life.  If you can appreciate these types of characters and this type of setting, I'm not sure how you could not like this book.hree hours from Wyoming and have lived in small towns most of my life.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|I think it's important when you start a book series you should see it through. Was the VR's best work in my opinion .....absolutely not. Are the characters still wonderful and capture your heart absolutely!  Did she take a risk with her choice to end the book the way she did absolutely. I didn't need a happy ever after ending but there was so much wordiness that I don't feel Allegiant grabbed you like the other two books did.  Tris and  Tobia's romance doesn't have the same heat as the other books.  The back and forth between Tris and Tobias was unnecessary because you never gained any deeper perspectives. Maybe she took this writing approach because she was going to surprise us  with the ending.I advise you read it to see the series through. There are moments, not many, where you see her spark from the previous novels return but I have to agree it 's very luke warm.
B005J2UM9S|2.0|At first it looked kind of dumb but it started getting pretty good! I was thinking this could actually turn out to be a good movie, then, nope. It got pretty unrealistic and dumb towards the end.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|Works pretty well. Not amazing, but it'll put a working edge on even a very dull and gnarled knife. Nice low price, light weight, small and portable. If you want a great edge this isn't the best choice, but for what it is made for it works nicely.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King brings one of his youngest characters back now older but not sure if he is wiser. His demons are real and he fights them the same way we do.  King develops the story so you get to know Danny and the shining better then you did in the Shining. If you want to know how Danny the boy does as Dan the man you won't be disappointed.

I've tweaked my home computer's monitor pretty well but I knew it was still a little off.  After using the ColorMunki Smile the before and after difference is amazing.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- Ridiculously easy to use.  Drape the device over the center of your monitor's screen, press start and it does the rest.  I timed it and it took exactly 5 minutes.  After the process it lets you toggle between \\"before\\" and \\"after\\".  The difference is dramatic.<br />- There is exactly zero need to understand anything about color or monitor setup.<br />- I printed a high-resolution test chart and compared it to what I saw on my monitor and it was as close is technologically possible.<br /><br />THINGS TO KNOW:<br /><br />- The installation process reminded me of the days of software installation that used floppy disks.  There were something like a dozen times it asked if I wanted to continue and the whole installation took about 5 minutes.<br />- The instruction manual is useless, fortunately there's not a lot involved.<br /><br />Here are some hints for important things not covered in the instructions:<br /><br />1. Before you start, use the reset button on your monitor. If it doesn't have a reset button, set everything to the default position and turn off all color correction features including automatic brightness control. This is important because many newer monitors will want to constantly color correct, defeating the idea of calibrating your system.<br />2. Do not have open windows, light bulbs or anything else shining on your monitor screen.  Do the calibration in the same lighting conditions you would normally have while editing and printing photos.<br />3. Tilt your monitor back slightly (5 degrees is fine) so the device lays completely flat against the screen.  Make sure to place it in the dead center of where the software tells you to.<br />4. Let the monitor \\"warm up\\" for about 10 minutes prior to calibration. Yes, even an LCD or LED monitor takes a few minutes to stabilize and settle in.<br />5. Don't bump the monitor or change any room lighting during the 5 minute process.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />I am extremely pleased not only with the look of images on my screen, but how well they match the output of my printer.

B0060ZJ7BC|2.0|If this is an Oscar-nominated film, Hollywood is in deep trouble. It simply wasn't that good.<br /><br />Did we really have to see Beane's interactions with his daughter and twice suffer through her singing a Lenka song, a tune which is even irritating when sung by Lenka? His relationship with the child did NOTHING to advance the story.<br /><br />The screenplay was dismal. There was absolutely no suspense and there should have been plenty. There was little explanation of Pitt's wheeling and dealing on the phone with club owners. Even the winning of 20 games in a row was not depicted in a thrilling way. It was not.<br /><br />I'm not going to write anything more except to say that Beane, a high school graduate and failed major leaguer, had to have a screw loose to turn down $12.5 million to be the GM of the Red Sox, a team that went on to win the World Series.
B0094K1PW4|3.0|Great special effects, but a bit reminiscent of &#34;It&#34; and &#34;ET&#34;. Not bad though and it was entertains for the most part.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|I was looking forward to my calendars syncing similar to other android devices, but this app does not. Great free app if you don't need multiple calendars.
B008EL25LE|5.0|I am a fan of Match Three games and I have the first one so I thought I would give this one a try. It is a lot of fun but not overwhelming in trying to complete the levels so far. The only downside is that it doesn't have relaxed mode. I forgot that or I  would have given it four stars instead of five. At my age I enjoy playing but I'm not in as big of a hurry as I used to be. I enjoy playing both versions.
B00COQTZLS|1.0|I just donated $9.99 for an app that doesn't do what it says within the Kindle App Store. PI works fine on my android phone but not on the Kindle. Do not purchase this app. I'm very upset about giving money away for nothing. Bummer really.

031624662X|5.0|An excellent, well written, well put together story set in a rich world that leaves enough hidden for tons of future exploration of its depths. This is one of those rare books that combines some more experimental thinking about possible future societies (instead of your standard space opera fare which mostly just involves dropping people from today into a world with spaceships and laser guns, but otherwise familiar), with a well crafted and fun adventure story at its heart. I heartily recommend and can't wait for the sequels.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|This is a must see.... it has all the exitement and suspense a living person could ask for. You'll want to watch it again and again.
0385537131|5.0|There is no better novelist around today.  Grisham is always compelling. This book was just released October 22nd.  I received it October 23rd.  I've started reading it and had a hard time putting it down. RECOMMENDED!

B00C0K6NUY|5.0|Full of blood and guts, hard to put down with a free running story. Don't give to your kids until they grow up.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A story of loss and hope that could have happened to any one of us. But it has special meaning in the context of Afghanistan

B000B589JI|3.0|Wouldn't hold fluid for more than a few days due to evaporation. Others suggest it needs a better washer to close tight.
B00E68927E|5.0|if you were expecting this record for a long time, you wont be disappointed, this the comeback of a MASTER  !
B00BRUPICM|5.0|The story was beautifully written..sometimes it was difficult to follow all the characters but, finally it came together..an original story with historical information that was familiar and enlightening..the characters were charismatic and I was fascinated with the book.
0345803485|1.0|This seems like it was written by a teenage girl who is a virgin herself.  The sex scenes are no where near detailed enough.  Would not recommend to anyone seeking a pornographic novel.  Try Anais Nin or Varian Krylov.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The book is over 500 pages and dragged a little. I did not mind the drag, but the end was horrible. I had to follow through because I read the first two books. There was no conclusion that led to any purpose. The main character dies for nothing, We morn her, but the people are still divided. The facility in the outskirt of the city still remains. People will still commit discrimination. None of our favorite characters were trying to change the world. I don't see the reason for Tris death, After reading the book i asked myself the message i received from the book? It is a must read, because you read the first two books. This book slipped horribly. I'm sorry to say this one was a miss, The book was close to being amazing.
B000TU16GS|5.0|This book is amazing and you should read it. Alex Rider is a boss and is ninja. This is the best book ever
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Don't think about watching this amazing movie, just watch it! Very well written story and film. Tom Hanks did very good job.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This game is immensely improved from the previous two versions. It offers variety and a higher degree of challenge and a replay value that didn't present themselves before. I'd recommend this game to anyone looking to while away the time with challenging puzzles and a smooth sound track.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|i have played the other deer hunter game and this one is way better. weapen upgrades are in this one and more weapons
B00FR88VTC|1.0|It looks like another lousy camera app with no guide to help and no link to go to for help. Save your two bucks.<br />If someone can tell me how to use it, I'm not that bright, and it works as advertised than I could change my review.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|Great for 2 year olds. It teaches eye hand coordination. Applause and baloon popping when each individual puzzle is completed. Very good variety in the vehicles
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Eyes have been opened . . . ears to hear and hearts to receive . . . because of Malala we all begin to grow and accept . . . there is always knowledge to gain  . . . there is always help to give . . . Her story was a blessing to me, and an encouragement for me as an educator, and to strengthen in the effort to share the joy and love of learning . . .
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great show, I liked it almost as good as the first show.  If you like horror you will enjoy this show.
B004ID52YO|2.0|I didn't care for this one. I highly recommend Big TV and To Lose My Life. Pass on this one.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|i experienced this novel with the characters,due to the thoughtful writing and the insight of what each person was thinking as their story progressed.
B004SBX112|5.0|Good game, but I recently changed from iPhone to Android phone.  Game not as easy to use on Android as on iPhone.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Very well written. Erotic. However, it could be better. Too many repeated thoughts that it's almost annoying, yet still captivating.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A must read for everyone, I could not put it down ??a very captivating book ......... Will read the other two books ....
B0090EHVMC|5.0|My kids love this movie!  They watch it over and over again!  The story has a good message for children.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It appears that the majority of people who did not rate this highly was because it didn't fit THEIR expectations for how the series should end.<br /><br />Given the character development throughout the series, it seemed totally appropriate to me.  Yes, the two points of view was a little strange, given that wasn't something that happened in the first two books, but I was able to roll with it.  Yes, it would have been &#34;nice&#34; to see the ending happen differently, but it is refreshing that it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows because that's unrealistic, especially given all the adversity that Tris has to overcome.<br /><br />There were a few plot points that some people had a hard time accepting, but I think if one has experienced trauma or extreme parental conflict, those plots points are not as difficult to accept (specifically, Evelyn and Tobias's choices at the end).  Also, yes, it is somewhat the same plot line as in the first two books, but I think that was the point... that it's a never ending circle of discrimination and isolation and labeling and stupidity, no matter where you go.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the commentary Roth provides us on the topics of love, oppression, and discrimination of various peoples for various reasoning (whether it's by faction or genetics).  Especially given that it's YA, it seems like a good series to get younger people thinking about these complex social concepts.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|First, I wasn't all that impressed with these books as it was, but I don't like to leave things unfinished. Second, I wasn't expecting high quality writing from a writer who writes for teenagers, but I was surprised by how poorly this book was written.<br /><br />Since the writer decided to split the story between two characters, she would have been better off to constantly refer to who was being portrayed at all times. There was frequently times where I was confused as to whether I was reading from Tris or Tobias's POV and would have to check back. They seemed like almost the same person, even though they were clearly supposed to be different people.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br />I understand that the writer was going for the shock value of killing off Tris, but I find that annoying and petty when writers of books that aren't up to the classic standards try and do something like that. She is no George RR Martin, and the books are so short and lacking depth that it was crap to kill off Tris and try and play the grief card.<br /><br />Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this book. I'm sad that I wasted a night of reading instead of doing my statistics homework.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|This was my poop read. I've never been so haapy to have constant diarrhea in my life. Kindle is messy.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|wow. by far their best album, and definitely one of the best albums of the year. the production, lyrics, songwriting, everything is in top form here. even if you are not a fan of their earlier stuff, you should at least give this a listen
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A friend introduced me to this game on her phone. Of course there was no version compatible with MY phone and no kindle version. But now I am able to play on my kindle. Thank you thank you thank you!!!!
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|With their fifth album the arctic monkeys have proved themselves to be the most consistently good Brit-rock band of the past decade. This one resembles humbug more than any of the other albums, with all the mid tempo rock songs and spooky organ-laced ballads, but there's some cool falsetto background vocals and piano harmony stuff that we haven't really heard in any of their albums before. Part of me wishes there were a few more more fast, angry songs, but if this album proves anything it's that every Arctic Monkeys album is slightly, but distinctly different from the last.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Cool game that is totally addictive.....just like candy.  I do like that it has some catches in there to prohibit you from going to another level sometimes.  At least this way the game forces me to stop playing and I can get a life!  LOL

B00EY8A6BC|3.0|This movie was fun.  It was over-the-top, but not in the vein of the Prestige or The Illusionist (those, in my opinion, were much better stories).  For having such big name actors, the acting was as good as it could be given what I think the script was.  I watched this with my roommates and we all enjoyed it and felt it was worth the rental.  It is not the kind of movie you could watch more than once.  But it's light, fun, and has some good twists/action.  If I were giving letter grades, I would give it a B/B-
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Not just a cute kids game... it is a wonderful app for Adults and Kids to enjoy Fire fighting/Physics Strategies.<br />Pleasant 3D Graphics and Smooth movements make FIRE FIGHTING lots of Fun. It has many obstacles and you have to figure out the best Strategy to SHOOT WATER at several hot spots on each level. Challenges are extremely well designed. Gameplay is Engaging and Satisfying when you get fires out with a good score.  You can also REPLAY levels for higher scores. The Music and Sound effects are pleasant and  Controls work well. Challenges start easy and get harder as you progress. This app is even more Fun than the original Sprinkle. KUDOS to Mediocre for making the cool Sprinkle apps and their other GEM (Granny Smith) which is EXCELLENT.<br /><br />Overall, a TOP NOTCH App with challenging Enjoyment for all ages. Many Cute elements and a real pleasure to play.  Highly polished app with NO intrusive ads, Data-mining addons or other annoyances of any kind. THANK S to Mediocre for keeping it SAFE and clean.  Excellent Replay value.  Well worth the price.  A fabulous KEEPER!

B0010SKUYM|5.0|I don't read much fantasy - generally they are little more than tired cliche. Here's an author who takes a genre as stale as crusty old bread and makes it more than palatable - he makes it fresh. The character development in Kingkiller is unique - and intricately woven.<br /><br />The world Rothfuss has created bleeds authenticity from every page. This is a hero story - but inasmuch as it's about a hero, it's also about man who makes terrible mistakes and suffers the consequences. It's about a boy who is utterly lost and struggling alone to make himself into a man.<br /><br />I strongly recommend Day One to any reader of fiction. The richness of this world will captivate you - it has to. That's what best-in-a-generation writing does.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|3.5 stars<br />Is this my favorite book in the series? No. Did I enjoy it? Yes. It was well written (I actually liked the POV changes and even did t mind the &#34;genetics stuff&#34;) and I thought Roth handled the &#34;spoiler&#34; really nicely, especially the characters' reactions to the event. Overall I may be in the minority, but I like the book and while the fan girl in me still sort of wishes for a different ending, I respect the one Roth wanted to give us.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This was a strong series. The middle book lagged for me in places as I grew frustrated with Tris's increasingly poor choices. Circular thinking stalled the story. Tris felt like a child in crisis from beginning to end and everything became stale as she rode current after current instead of making her own waves. But, in this book- she grew up! And her growth saw everyone around her evolve too. I work with Young Adults in a library and trust me, I almost didn't read this book because of the poor reviews. There is NO hiding the SPOILER and the MANY disappointed fans. I thought Roth was nuts. Who messes with teen fandom after your book has been picked up for a big budget movie makeover? But, after reading Allegiant- I think the answer is someone who is both dauntless and candor. Roth wrote a great series and her final book was solid with an excellently managed two person view. Nothing felt like it was done for shock value because every consequence rang true for all the characters. I think young people will ache for how the series ended, but for those who have suffered loss and chosen or witnessed real courage will find their own truth in Tris's journey. I will read this series again and I will continue recommending it to my readers over 13.
B007F0IXD4|5.0|You can find more of my reviews on my co-owned blog Boricuan Bookworms [...]<br /><br />I have to admit that I'm a bit scared after reading this book. I have found a new favorite author.<br /><br />There are few times when a book makes a big impression on you, let it be in any moment in your life. This book is definitely staying with me for a while, I can feel it. A short yet extremely amazing scary story for all ages. You can't be too old or too young to read this masterpiece.<br /><br />While exploring her new home, Coraline meets the weird neighbors with which she shares a big house divided into flats. Everything seems boring and Coraline spends her first days there exploring before school starts. But while in her adventures, she discovers a door in the drawing room that is closed by a brick wall. When she opens it a second time while her parents are away, she is met by a different yet really alike world to her own. She has other parents who claim that will love her forever and always, making each new day an adventure for their loving daughter, but only if she sews two black buttons to her eyes. When she rejects this to her other mother, the real parents are taken from Caroline and the only way to bring them back, and free the mysterious three ghost children, is by challenging the other mother,  who each moment looks less like her mother and something more sinister.<br /><br />I had picked this book in an attempt to not read any ARCs, to read something because I simply wanted and without the obligation of anything, like the old times before a blog and such. A light and interesting read was all I wanted. I wasn't dissapointed. Some people must have seen the 2009 movie of the same name, at least I did before I even knew it was a book. I completely loved it and was even more excited to read the book to be met by such a mysterious and astounding plot.<br /><br />In terms of comparing it to the movie, it actually stuck to be really alike, except for a few things and characters that were probably added for more movie-ish things. The book's  plot didn't fail to keep you constantly guessing, even if you knew some things from the movie. I didn't remember much of it so it helped me to be all suspicious of the other mother's actions. The writing style of Neil Gaiman made it even better, simple yet effective to make your hairs stand up in your arms. It didn't help that I read most of this book at night, like really late at night. There were some things that were simply creepy and disgusting in an enjoyable way because it gave a more realistic feeling to the book.<br /><br />The characters, how do I express myself into telling you how much I loved each one of them? As simple or temporary as they were, each played an important paper in the story, either for the plot as it is the other mother, Coraline, and her parents and ghost kids, or even Coraline's own neighbors (the real ones). They teach Coraline a lesson of life and subconsciously help her through her quest against the other mother.<br /><br />~\\"How do I know you'll keep your word?\\" asked Coraline.<br />\\"I swear it,\\" said the other mother. \\"I swear it on my own mother's grave.\\"<br />\\"Does she have a grave?\\" asked Coraline.<br />\\"Oh yes,\\" said the other mother. \\"I put her in there myself. And when I found her trying to crawl out, I put her back.\\"<br /><br />That's an example of how evil the other mother is. When I read that part I felt the chills running up and down my spine, I got goosebumps, and had to stop reading all together, gasp, and say \\"damn.\\" As evil as she was, she was greatly developed. We don't know what she was in the end, so I suppose it as all part of the mystery of the book to let you thinking what it was. Was it an illusion? A big evil humanoid spider? A witch?<br /><br />My other favorite character was the cat with his sarcastic and sassy remarks towards Coraline. He felt really real and was a great addition to the book.<br /><br />~\\"We... we could be friends, you know,\\" said Coraline.<br />\\"We COULD be rare specimens of an exotic breed of African dancing elephants,\\" said the cat. \\"But we're not. At least,\\" it added cattily, after darting a brief look at Coraline, \\"I'M not.\\"<br /><br />And obviously, I loved to bits Coraline. Stubborn, adventurous, brave, independent, and a fighter, she was amazing for this book. She's exactly how I imagine kids to be, free and curious, yet they can be responsible, sensible, and cunning when needed to be. She was wise beyond her years (even is it's not explicitly mentioned) and it's all expressed in ways for kids to understand, and in ways that stick to your brain.<br /><br />~Coraline knew that when grown-ups told you something wouldn't hurt it almost always did.<br /><br />~Miss Spink and Miss Forcible made a point of telling Coraline how dangerous the well was, and they warned her to be sure she kept away from it. So Coraline set off to explore it, so that she knew where it was, to keep away from it properly.<br /><br />~“Because,' she said, 'when you're scared but you still do it anyway, that's brave.”<br /><br />~\\"I don't want whatever I want. Nobody does. Not really. What kind of fun would it be if I just got everything I ever wanted? Just like that, and it didn't mean anything. What then?\\"<br /><br />A great read you'll probably won't regret, honestly. I was so obsessed with knowing what would happen next, I was even reading between classes and in the classes, even if it was just a page. I was even making my friends crazy showing them interesting quotes or even the creepy and great illustrations by Dave McKean, which is a friend of the author. Those added more to the scary vibe of the book.<br /><br />Another thing I liked was that my version of the book had some bonuses like an author interview, pages from the original writing the author made, and such. With the interview I got to know more about Neil Gaiman and was impressed at how... simple and amazing he sounds, and to know he's a best-selling author of such great books, wow. We get to see more into what's behind the story of Coraline and what is from his life in said story. I particularly liked this he said in the end:<br />\\"It was a story, I learned when people began to read it, that children experienced as an adventure, but which gave adults nightmares. It's the strangest book I've written, it took the longest to write, and it's the book I'm proudest of.\\"<br /><br />Not only has the story inspired me to write, but his words and experience with the creation of Coraline are inspirations for writers of all kinds on that not all great stories are made in a rush or in a year. They can take even more than five years, with the slowest of progressions, and be a memorable piece of writing to stay in the hearts of all who reads it. At least now my mom won't say I never finish writing anything, because Neil Gaiman took quite a while to write this.<br /><br />Now, go buy or ask a friend for this book. Go go go. Don't let much time pass until you sink your teeth into this. Preferably at 12 am for a more spookier feel to it. I guarantee you'll love it, no matter what age you have.<br /><br />(Sorry for such a long review xD)<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars<br /><br />Review by Jennifer Madero :)

B0015346OM|5.0|Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War is Mark Bowden’s attempt to explain the events surrounding the 1993, First Battle of Mogadishu. The entire purpose of the book seems to be allowing the survivors of the battle a voice to express what really happened. Bowden writes from the third person perspective of those involved with the conflict – from the elements of Task Force Ranger to the Somalis caught up in the fighting. An extensive array of personalities and backgrounds appear within the pages of the book.<br /><br /> Through recounting the first hand accounts of those who fought and witnessed the battle Bowden exposes the failures that led to the deaths of American servicemen. The entire operation comes across as a mistake and in this Bowden does not come across as biased or jingoistic. The innocent civilians that are caught in the crossfire of the battle are given consideration in Black Hawk Down. If there is a theme to be found within the pages of this piece of journalism it is a warning not to underestimate a technologically inferior foe in combat and to avoid conflicts with no clear solution. The operation is generally considered a failure and Bowden’s writing would appear to confirm this opinion though judging by recent military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq the lessons of Black Hawk Down have not been properly heeded.<br /><br /> Though several books written about the First Battle of Mogadishu exist, Mark Bowden’s Black Hawk Down is widely regarded as the most comprehensive published account. The compilation of so many individual threads makes the book standout. The story is so highly praised that it inspired a film by the same name that also managed to meet critical acclaim.<br /> A broad array of sources was used to write the story. Bowden interviewed dozens of people from both sides of the conflict. As Bowden says, “So many of the men who fought in this battle agreed to tell me their stories that most of the incidents related in this book were described to me by several different soldiers.” This helps to overcome the limitations of memory. The fact that Somalis were interviewed as well as American servicemen speaks of an inherent lack of bias. Bowden also used books and articles as sources during the writing of the book but nothing can compare to the candid stories expressed by those involved in the fighting. Primarily Bowden asks, “What happened?” This is where Black Hawk Down is such a triumph of investigative journalism. There are things about the book that do not paint the United States or the Armed Forces in a positive light. Expressing such things lends credibility to the accounts of the soldiers, civilians, and by proxy – Bowden himself.<br /><br /> Black Hawk Down is extremely well written. Because the story of the First Battle of Mogadishu is told from the perspective of those on the ground (and in the air) it reads more like a novel than a historical text. The prose is gripping and immediate – it is easy to become absorbed in the frenetic pace of the fighting. The little bits of background that Bowden provides about individual soldiers serves to develop an emotional connection, reminding readers that these are indeed real people whose lives were at stake. Because there are no footnotes or annotations the flow of the text is not broken up by peripheral information. It is easy to pick up Black Hawk Down and just start reading it with little to no background of the event. The book is exciting and involving – accessible to intelligent readers and historians alike. Bowden uses military jargon, but does a thorough job of explaining it, and provides background knowledge of the Somalia situation before jumping into the battle proper. It is even worth noting that because of the narrative style of the text, Black Hawk Down can also easily appeal to fans of fiction as well as nonfiction.<br /><br /> In laying it all out there, in telling the soldiers’ story, Bowden succeeds. The themes ofBlack Hawk Down are revealed through narrative rather than soap boxing. This proves to be a far more effective method of persuasive argument than continually harping on something and is without a doubt the greatest strength of the work. All in all, it is possible to set aside Black Hawk Down after reading it and only take away the fear, courage, and ultimately duty felt by the elements of Task Force Ranger. If this is the case then Bowden still accomplishes his primary goal in publishing the story. The book is occasionally frenetic, though never disorganized, and it can be difficult to keep track of the myriad servicemen and civilians involved. These are forgivable sins that are eclipsed by the depth of investigative journalism Bowden puts on display. No one can ever read a single book and expect to know everything there is to know about a subject, but for those interested in the First Battle of Mogadishu, Black Hawk Down is a solid and thrilling place to start.Black Hawk Down are revealed through narrative rather than soap boxing.

B0043JDUNS|5.0|So cool.  I am not a big super hero fan or comic book fan, but this was super cool.  Love Downey and Gwyneth is perfect.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This explains what the U.S. was like before the maze.  It also introduces Thomas into the story .  This definitely should be read first to explain the book Maze Runner.  I did not see this or I would have naturally read it first. IT  explains the end of the Maze Runner and why.  It is well-written and flows smoothly.  I am looking forward to the next in the series.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|Not that great, was not that spiritual like a lot of others I have read about NDE 's.  Would not recommend, can't believe it was a bestseller.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Somehow I did not realize just how addictive a simple game could be.  This has provided a lot of entertainment.<br /><br />Will be playing for quite a while.

B00B8YSIMY|5.0|Although I am not really a fan of crime fiction, but I like the way the author illustrate the scenes so real as if I am taking it myself. There is this quote that I like... \\"Get clean, James. Just get clean - Jimmy's sister.<br /><br />This novel happened in modern day setting with the backdrop that drug addiction, rehabs, betrayal, murder is very rampant. I like the way the author talked about these events in such vivid scenes. The author takes the readers into the world of drugs (or the dark-side of our modern day society) where the main character, Jimmy was turned from a fine young man to a drug addict. It's so real.<br /><br />The main character, Jimmy Walker is a fine young man with adorable and likeable character but unfortunately lost his sense of life directions. However, Jimmy does preserved some little soul of sensibility. Jimmy is fully aware of his addictions, but he tried various efforts to jump up from the bottom. His life undergoes tremendous roller-coaster. There are lots twists and turns as he get involved into the drug dealing arena. Having said that, I am totally impressed how the author really takes great pains to illustrate this character in totality.  There is another character that I like is that gorgeous, flirty landlady, Sarah. Being a man, I like the way she flirted with Jimmy and his friend, Jason. This lady is also a drug dealer like Jason. She really knows how to dress so well and really has a class of it's own. To me, she is the ultimate perfect woman to mix up with. The author does really know how to increase the sex appeal of this woman.<br /><br />This is my first time reading Jams N Rose novel - Get Clean. This book is a great book with lots of surprises and twists. However, this book may not be suitable for younger audience as it does introduce them to drug. Overall, the author is very careful for not sharing too much of this trade. If you like great crime fiction, psychological thriller, you'll definitely get lots of entertainment and enjoyment out of this novel.<br /><br />This is my first time reading a novel by Jams N. Roses - Get Clean. All I say is that this book is a simple to follow book with great scenes on what is actually drug addiction and how it all get started from an innocent person. This book has lots of interesting twists, surprises that will thrills most mature adult readers. However, due to it's nature, I would advised parents to be guided when introducing this book to teens and young adults. If you like what is actually the dark side of drug addiction, drug dealing, crime fiction like what I like to read, you'll definitely get enjoyment out of this novel.<br /><br />If you like :<br /><br />- Melissa Miller's Irreparable Harm<br />- Carrard Hayes's Bourbon & Blood<br />- Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl<br /><br />I am sure you will like this novel as well!<br /><br />Before you read this book, you may want to check our [[ASIN:B004XDACV2 Irreparable Harm (Sasha McCandless Legal Thriller No. 1)]] and [[ASIN:B00CMB9OV6 Secrets and Lies - (A Suspense Thriller Novel)]].<br /><br />If there's one thing I'd change about this book, it would be to create this novel to be a story with less emphasis on drug addiction, drug dealings, but focuses more on why Jimmy Walker got himself addicted to drug. I hope the author will take note of it, but overall, this novel has a good plot to educate the public... perhaps in a more subdue manner...<br /><br />I am reading this novel on my iPad kindle app. The whole book has good layout and formatting. I believe it will appear great on other e-book readers.<br /><br />If you found this review useful, let the community know by clicking \\"YES\\" on the Helpful Vote.and enjoyment out of this novel.<br /><br />This is my first time reading a novel by Jams N.

B007VDN1PA|2.0|I can't get it to copy slides properly.  I have tried to copy them and they turn out Negatives.  The last several times I have tried to copy a slide I get nothing on the SD card.  The User's Manual is so skimpy it doesn't help solve my problem.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|It is a perfect game for getting your shooting game on and fun to play with friends and play online but it sucks that amazon did not make a new update like IOS because if they are reading this now I WANT THE FREIKEN UPDATE!!!!!!!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Great book so far. I am only halfway through it.  If you liked Gladwell's other books you will love this one.
B00A285OOW|3.0|I liked this book, however I wasn't a big fan of Elizabeth being so in love with Richard Usurper. But all in all the book was good. I wish she could've kept it going and not have stopped it when she did.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|A must read. Period. We are so insulated from experiences like Malala's. In order to change attitudes, these stories need to be heard. Very well written, very insightful young woman. I hope she realizes her dream.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I had seen this game about a year ago and at first I thought it looked kind of cheesy. But one day my daughter said that I should try and play it on her device and I got hooked. Then one day, Amazon app store had offered it as a free app of the day, so I downloaded and installed it. I instantly fell in love with it and could not put it down for the longest time. The controls are very easy, and the game itself is very challenging because you have to be very precise about what you do. It only took me a few days to complete all levels, including getting all three apples on each level to unlock the final character. However, the biggest challenge is trying to be all of your high scores on each level. On my Samsung Galaxy S3, it runs flawlessly and has never crashed, nor given me any sort of problems whatsoever. I recommend this game for everybody, not just kids. I can't wait to see what the developer comes up with next.
B00EVPSJOE|3.0|The DVD while in 5.1 was not the 28 track disc as advertised. I was expecting the full show as aired on MTV plus the alternate  takes as aired later in the year on MTV. This was short of that and missed the only New Song in the set Circus. I was expecting a great dvd and got less than MTV aired! Amazon need to fix the listing...
0547258305|3.0|I couldn't put this book down. But the ending left me dissatisfied. I think what really irks me is that here we have a very conventional story of girl meets boy, they have a love/hate relationship, though they are clearly destined for one another, but because they don't have a traditional relationship (i.e., married), we're supposed to applaud the author for her willingness to push boundaries. It's kind of annoying because the story (well the romantic thread at least) follows such a tried and true love story format that the \\"no marriage for me\\" part is so jarring, it almost makes the whole thing, well, ridiculous. And after all that they've been through and even though her guy has more than proven his worth as a partner, the main female superwoman doesn't even at least reconsider/further develop her feelings on what it means to be committed to someone. I'm not saying she should marry the guy, I'm just saying where's the character development? I'd welcome/enjoy a true break from the traditional love story format. This is a weak attempt, and it bothers me that this weak attempt should be considered so praiseworthy. I mean, I don't like the \\"Twilight\\" trope of love/romance (OK, I really hate it), but I don't think this offers a more viable, better depiction of relationships.<br /><br />Also, and I know people have argued this in the comments, but as for me, and I'm an adult, I picked this up not expecting sex, since it was a young adult novel, and was surprised that there was sex. Just because many kids know about sex/have sex these days (even at age 14), doesn't mean they need to be bombarded with it, even in their action-adventure fantasy reading. The description of sex didn't add anything to the story, so I'm not sure why it was necessary...oh wait, because this author \\"pushes boundaries.\\" Whatever.<br /><br />Still gave it 3 stars because all the action kept me reading and reading. Loved that part of the book!
B000OLTMQ8|4.0|Cool movie with a surprising ending! I actually was bummed out about a tough class and watched the movie for a good mental push!
B00EQ8J1OI|5.0|This is a great resource for the self coached swimmer seeking to improve their freestyle stroke and swim times.  I took 20 seconds off of my 100 yard swim time within one month of working through the book.
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|Great characters and interesting historical fiction until they tried to portray the homosexual butler, Thomas, as a tragic victim of circumstances beyond his control.  The society of the 1920s would barely embrace a reformed prostitute; they certainly wouldn't accept the homosexual or his lifestyle, treat him as a victim, or elevate him to a respectable position in an aristocratic household.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Contains spoilers.<br /><br />I reread the first two books several times. I LOVED the interactions between Tris and Tobias and adored the environment and world that Roth had created. Though they weren't the best written books, I was absolutely consumed within the story and gave my emotions completely to the relationships. Sconce June I had been counting down the days until Allegiant was released. Even preordered the book which I never do.<br /><br />I got the book on my Kindle and instantly began reading feverishly. I fell asleep literally with my iPad in my hands. I then woke up and sat down at the breakfast table with my roommates to finish it. I didn't even look at spoilers because I wanted my emotional love for the characters to be untainted.<br /><br />Then my life changed forever. I reread the line about Tris dying several times, still not believing it. Tears started streaming down my face and I frantically went to the end of the book to see if she came back alive. I threw my ipad in disgust and anger and cried, truly cried. Scared my poor roommates too but I didn't care.<br /><br />Horrible, horrible ending to a previously great series. Absolutely the worst ending to a story arc I have ever read. Well done Veronica Roth... You have officially made me despise your works and I will never read another one of your book.
1484810457|4.0|Orthodoxy is much easier to follow than Chesterton's previous work 'Heretics'.  It's not a long book, but the 159 pages consist of only 7 chapters with multitudes of great ideas in each chapter.  The sheer volume of explanation and example in each chapter made me feel like I was listening to Chesterton himself rambling on and on. He gives some great insight into the conflicts between Christ believers and skeptics, probably because he was a skeptic himself. I expected this book to be dated, but it is remarkably timeless.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicted !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love this game.  Play it all the time. Introduced it to several people now they are hooked too.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is very addicting but is very hard and it is very obvious that they make it so that you can't beat a level without spending money, which I refuse to do. But at your own risk.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|From the first line this book draws you into another world and time, both recognizable and strange. At times it was like being lost in my own backyard, looking at things that were familiar but not and then it just slips away. Love this!
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|This is definitely worthy of being self-titled. Dream Theater keeps getting better and better. Definitely glad I purchased this one.
006202406X|1.0|The final book in this trilogy was a huge disappointment. I'm so sorry I wasted my time on this book trilogy.  I will not support the movies being made from Ms Roth's books. Don't buy this book, don't waste your time too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have waited a long time to play this on my Kindle Fire, thank you!!!  I love that I can store my lives,, unlike the desktop version. The only drawback is that my husband has a hard time seeing the difference in color during bomb levels. I love a challenge; this game certainly provides that, with much entertainment along the journey. Keep up the great work!!
B0000VCZKM|2.0|Not really sure what makes this special. This review is for the quality not the movie itself which we love. The picture quality is TERRIBLE. Worse than an old VHS. Weird.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|this should be a game for all ages:  I am 80 yrs young, but some how when I get to (1) left it always ends.  You just can't make some easier games and allow some of these 1 left to win.<br /><br />Despise not being able to continue games as long as I want, and have to wait for the time lapse in order to start playing again.  I want a game that runs continuously with no interruptions.  Ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!!

A  great family afternoon on the big TV.<br />A few years ago, I purchased the CD for my  12 year old Granddaughter.<br />She fell in love with John Travolta.

The quartz and kinetic are dress watches and poor choices since I don't wear them often and they either have a dead battery when I want to wear it or the kinetic takes forever to charge the watch. This is why I wanted the automatic and bought the Black Monster. I liked the beefy watch but it was just too heavy on my wrist. I ended up looking for a different daily watch and researched and decided on the SNK809.<br /><br />Wow! I really like this watch! It is light and even though it has the same movement that the Black Monster has, it keeps much better time. I was gaining 20 seconds a day it seemed with the Black Monster while the SNK809 is maybe a couple seconds off a day.<br /><br />For the price this is a great watch and the classic look is clean and attractive, particularly if you replace the band with a better one. I replaced mine with a Hirsch Liberty leather 18mm watch band and it really looks stylish now. This is my favorite watch now!

B009LDCZDC|5.0|A must view on a large screen in blue ray. This is edge of the seat, compelling viewing...an awesome storyline ,and fantastic acting.season 1 blew us away, and the long wait for season 2 was worth it<br />Regrettably, season 3 has started off on the wrong foot with the rather fracked up daughter, who actually has no relevance to the story line....a few well placed smacks across her chops and she is right to go?<br />Hope they get back to the storyline?

030746363X|5.0|Hi got this book because a friend of mine was interested in losing some weight, and I wanted to get in better shape in general. I had read 4 Hour Workweek and really like Tim's style and approach to solving problems, so I figured this would be the same sort of ideas but focused on health. While this book is considerably larger, it covers a lot of different things: weight loss, muscle gain, sleep issues, exercise and training, sex, and even a few recipes, all in keeping with the Timothy Ferriss style of &#34;minimal work, maximal gain&#34;. Using the Slow-Carb diet from this book, my friend lost 7 lbs in the first week! I have already started making changes to my diet that have made me feel better overall (be careful about hydration on the Slow Carb though- I had some issues), and have found several exercise routines that seem manageable and like they should produce results (I have only been doing them for a week, so it's hard to say if they work yet). Also, studying polyphasic sleep and the diets of successful athletes is fun, and might yield some useful ideas! There's a lot going on in here, and it might not all be useful to everyone, but there is definitely something useful in here for everyone who would like to improve themselves physically in some way shape or form.<br /><br />Sorry About The One Long Paragraph!!!<br />Justice McIWasExcited

B003DXSXCI|5.0|This is obviously one of the famous SM movies. I've seen it numerous times over the years. Wish it had more action sequences, but still outstanding!
0385743564|5.0|Sanderson takes the maxim \\"absolute power corrupts absolutely\\" and melds it with a story of the mythic heroes of our age, comic book type superheroes.  What would happen if something suddenly started giving normal humans the nearly absolute power of superheroes?  And if the maxim held, then who could stand up to them?<br /><br />The answer, of course, is a David against the Goliaths.  And one Goliath in particular, named Steelheart.  (And, yeah, Sanderson kind of unfortunately gives his David the name: David.  But you get past that.)<br /><br />I'd never read anything by Brandon Sanderson; had never heard of him before.  So I didn't open the book with any preconceived notions.  (I also didn't have any idea it's supposed to be a YA book until after I finished and read something about that - but it didn't have a YA feel to it, certainly not as much as Hunger Games, which I also enjoyed.)<br /><br />I happened to have stumbled on the book from a sci-fi website that mentioned it and had a link to the first couple of chapters.  A smart marketing move, since Sanderson hooked me with his first sentence:  \\"I've seen Steelheart bleed.\\"<br /><br />Sanderson does a great job of imagining what would happen in a world overrun by \\"Epics,\\" his term for the powerful not-superheroes.  It's a place you don't really want to be - the Bizzaro world version of Marvel or DC comics, and not in a good way.<br /><br />The story is about revenge - a staple for the comic genre, of course.  And David joins a group of freedom fighters, or vigilantes depending on your view, called Reckoners.  There are hundreds of Epics loose on the Earth now, and one of the enjoyable things in the book - for me - is Sanderson's invention of several different Epics.  Because he goes into their types, classifications, powers, weaknesses, etc.  He does a good job of world-building for this novel.  I especially liked his brief depiction of \\"the faithful\\" who believe good Epics must arise, and there's a nice description at one point where you get what Sanderson's hinting at, although he doesn't come right out and say it - and for comic book fans, it's a nearly perfect moment in this book.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great yarn.  Lots of fun to read.  Well worth the time and money.<br /><br />I usually read thrillers and mysteries and detective novels.  This was as good as the best of those, with the added element of superheros (or the opposite of them, in this case), which was fun.<br /><br />I'd kinda rather read a stand-alone book than the first of a series.  And though there are some elements that aren't completely explained in this story - such as why people started getting Epic powers - it doesn't detract from this story.  Not sure I'll pick up the next one.  But I don't feel like I need to because \\"Steelheart\\" is a completely satisfying read all by itself.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|These songs combine the excellent sound of the cello and the piano, arranged beautifully.  I love the songs that mix two traditional songs such as Carol of the Bells and God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.  I'm having a hard time not listening to this a few times a day.  Perhaps that will work closer to Christmas.

B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|My family and I nearly missed this movie because of reading the negative reviews here at Amazon!  But, this flick was on the fridge \\"Movies to Rent\\" list.  So... we rented.  Well, I can tell you that not only did Jaden Smith prove his acting mettle (I state this in vehement opposition to reviews to the contrary), he also gets credit for being in a movie that manages to put a new spin on a 'fate o' the world genre' story.<br /><br />Will Smith (as usual) delivered a fine performance as Jaden's stiff but loving father, but the spotlight shines squarely upon the shoulders of his son.  There was not a single moment of boredom during the film and honestly, the only \\"unbelievable\\" portion was the behavior of one of the birds of prey in the film.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anybody that enjoys adventure, suspense, a wee bit o' monster-movie type horror and father/son drama.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I really like pinterest. It has a bunch of cool diy projects and recipes in one convenient place. Thank you!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|What a well written series.  Before reading Allegiant, I went over some reviews and was surprised by the lack of love this last book got.  After finishing it, I think I understand.  This story does not have a \\"happy ever after\\" ending.  I cried right along with the characters for the last few chapters.  Be that as it may, I appreciated the rawness and vulnerability.  I like realism as much as I like fantasy. So without spoiling anything go into this book knowing you will morn for some, hurt for others and feel their hope of change and a future.

B00FN811SY|5.0|I haven't yet had my girls try to download the app on their Kindle fire because I just found out the app. is on amazon. I have a Samsung Galaxy tablet and the app works perfect on that. Also I have a pretty cheap smartphone with Walmart  Straighttalk and it is wonderful!!! I have bought from Amazon for years and will continue to do so. That being said Android type phones and Tablets are so much easier to download any jw.org stuff. I bought Aldiko premium book reader for 2.99 (free version can't do everything) in google playstore so I could look up scriptures and highlight. It works great but I am sure once more books ect. are added to the new JW Library app it will surpase that and then some. I don't have an Apple budget so the Samsung Galaxy Tablet 7\\" has been real nice. Prior to this I had a Nook and had to side load everything which was a royal pain. I (personally) need something that I can directly download to and  researched for a long time before getting the Samsung. I actually wanted the Samsung Galaxy Note so I could use it at Assembys and Conventions but it was a budget buster for me at this time. I will have my daughters try to download the app on their Kindle Fire tomorrow. If they have issues I will end up eventually buying them an Android tablet that they can easily download to. The JW Library app is so wonderful it is worth any added cost that I can afford, to have it easily downloaded on a device for my girls. And... they are going to add to it later. WOW!!! Friends do the research and make sure you have enough of expandable memory as this app has room for many added features. Personally I am looking for a larger screen (straight talk) phone so I can carry my library with me everywhere. I am totally awed and amazed at what the brothers have done and will continue to do with this app. Please friends, don't forget that with any future donations to the World Wide Work.<br />As for Amazon, I hope this app downloads easily and completely. Yes it is free but let's face it, most of us buy at one time or another from Amazon. This app will keep some of Amazons current customers happy and bring in those that perhaps wouldn't go on it's site otherwise. So it is in their best interest, especially us being an international organization. I use to side load stuff on the girls Kindle Fire by using Calibre. It worked well, but as I have said before I prefer downloading directly as I NEED easy.<br />Love to all of you my wonderful brothers and sisters. May Jehovah continue to bless everyones efforts as they continue to spread the good news with the help of the 2013 revised New World Translation (which Is AMAZING) and the JW Library app. Also, Thanks to Apple, Google, Microsoft and of course Amazon for allowing us to get the WONDERFUL app from their sites.t let's face it, most of us buy at one time or another from Amazon.

B00DPH7QFM|4.0|Following Blackmore's departure from Deep Purple in 1993, Ritchie put together a new Rainbow lineup, recorded a fine album (Strangers In Us All) and hit the road. The album didn't sell and within fairly short order Rainbow was folded, with Ritchie opting to form Blackmore's Night with his wife Candice. Blackmore's Night plays medieval renaissance music in traditional acoustic form, which meant Ritchie basically put the Strat into mothballs. Bit of a shame, really, because Black Masquerade finds Blackmore displaying his hard rock technique with a level of ability as strong as it ever was. I'd be disingenuous to claim this was Rainbow's most distinctive lineup: Paul Morris and Greg Smith execute their keyboard and bass parts with competence. Chuck Burgi is technically a fine rock drummer. None of them are likely to be known beyond avid Blackmore fan circles, mostly because they are (as mentioned) competent yet non-distinctive. Doogie White, much like the rest of the band, is technically quite good: as a singer, it's a pretty tall order to essay tunes from such noted vocalists as Ronnie James Dio, David Coverdale and Ian Gillan - along with Graham Bonnet and Joe Lynn Turner - and be able to pull it off. White does, although his voice is almost a bit too flawless and smooth for my tastes if that makes any sense. Not a lot of individual character. The main attraction here is Blackmore, and while I'd agree the bass and keyboards are a bit too low in the mix, for me this was kind of a plus (I mean, are people really buying this on the strength of Paul Morris and/or Greg Smith performing?). It's just good to have what, as another reviewer mentioned, was a fairly well-circulated (in Rainbow fan circles, anyway) show cleaned up and made available for release, as I'd also readily agree with that same reviewer that this release is in far superior condition than any of the bootlegs in circulation. I suppose casual rock fans might say that since this isn't one of the definitive Rainbow lineups the dvd isn't an essential release, and I suppose were I a casual rock fan I'd agree. However, I'm a fairly avid Blackmore fan, and the show was professionally shot, has a good mix, demonstrates Blackmore in excellent form with a highly competent backing group and has a good deal of better known Rainbow and Deep Purple songs alongside the Strangers In Us All material. Well worth it considering it's less than $20.

006202406X|1.0|What if everything you just read in Divergent and Insurgent was a lie? That's how I feel after reading Allegiant. It is like all that was accomplished in the first two books meant nothing. Tris's parents death, for nothing. Breaking into Erudite HQ to save the video, for nothing. It was all a lie. Reading Allegiant was almost like reading a story from a completely different series by a different author. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the first two books, but I had to force myself to get through this one. The dual POV sucked, I couldn't tell who was who. The story was too complicated with all the GD/GP drama on top of the civil war in Chicago. The side characters meant nothing. Uriah had been one of my favorite characters through the first two books, but he was dead in this one long before the explosion. I felt nothing at his death. Tobias was a totally different character. Gone was his cool confidence. He was a whiny, impulsive fool in this book. And for all the fuss made over Caleb in this book, I really never understood him. He deserved to be developed more and he deserved to be allowed to redeem himself. And I won't even begin to talk about Tris's unnecessary sacrifice. I mean really? The big moral question is whether or not people's memories should be wiped out? I just did not like this book and I'm going to pretend I never read it so I can continue to enjoy Divergent and Insurgent.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I take my kindle with me on road trips. This alarm is very handy to have and has never failed me.
006202406X|1.0|Like everyone else I was not a big fan of the ending! However, that was not the only problem with the book. The 2 POV was very confusing I had to go back to see who was narrating the chapter. The plot was boring and confusing I was literally falling asleep in some of thd chapters. This book brought me to tears not only because of how Tris' life ended but because I wasted an entire day reading a deficient storyline.

B006ZN7KMM|3.0|Es un buen ejercicio de investigación y relatorías de historias, los temas son buenos pero la mayoría habla sobre temáticas ríspidas, de confrotación, de lucha, muy enriquecedoras pero te quedas con la sensación de querer contrarrestar eso con una historia opuesta a las mencionadas. Bien, la idea de El País de compilar este libro.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The writing is absolutely fantastic, it is hard to believe there isn't a different author for each character. The only drawback is the mind boggling amount of detail, which I found difficult to sift through. I found myself at times reading only a single sentence from a page and moving on, being able to deduce everything of importance at a glance and shipping the rest to maintain my interest. If all the things to complain about, that is definitely the best problem to have, and this is definitely one of my favorite books of the series.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|You have to complete three of their quests successfully and you have to wait at least 24 hrs before it will let you go to the second quest...Then the third quest...all together at least a 3 day wait just to go on to level 36.  It isn't a lot, 99 cents I believe, but still irritating.  It also gets harder and harder and offers you help in the form of different candies to crush and finish the level but you have to pay for that.  So basically, it's a great game but it will nickel and dime you to death until you have paid quite a high price for it in the end...or...a little less money but three times the time to get through it and a lot of time spent waiting completing their quests to avoid paying,, taking longer to finish the levels and waiting for more lives which also take time to recharge (unless you buy them).
B002XBVQKW|5.0|Yes, it's a little gory in places but the musical scores are terrific. If you don't like going to the dentist, this movie will make it worse.
B000002MI4|5.0|I'm unable to control my fingers: I have to dash off a short appreciation of The Juliet Letters. Songs from it have been getting stuck in my head constantly for the past two months: especially This Sad Burlesque. Could there be a better ode to our current Congress?<br /><br />Now two decades removed from the musical trends of the time and the fanish concerns about whether this meant the end of The Attractions for the twelfth time, TJL shines and shines. Perfect in it's own way, this loose concept album by Costello and the energetic and soulful Brodsky Quartet stands as a unique jewel in my CD collection--though it could have birthed a new genre of music. Chamber Punk?<br /><br />There's really not a weak piece on here, but some of the brightest stars in its firmament are: Almost Had A Weakness, a reply from the POV of an old woman to one of her undeserving relations who are unsuccessfully trying to worm their way into her will, Taking My Life In Your Hands, which is just impressive in every way you can imagine, the saucy This Offer Is Unrepeatable, and the philosophically comedic sci-fi piece, Damnation's Cellar.<br /><br />It ends with the truly lovely, truly haunting, The Birds Will Still Be Singing. These songs are deep and shallow, high and low, and they just get better, the more you listen. All those involved must have felt like the proverbial canary-fed feline having created it. I'm so glad they did.
B00881VLCE|4.0|liked doing  puzzles while watching Tv. but new updates make it very hard to open. get forceclose most times. if it does open must quit after 2 games or it freezes up my kindle. wish I had the game back the way it was 2 years ago when I could play it for hours with no problems. before the new look. just shows if it was not broke don't fix it. now it is broke lets go back please.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Allegiant is the 3rd and final book in the Divergent series. It picks up at the end of book 2 with the release of the Edith Prior video and the knowledge that there may indeed be a civilization outside the fence. After the release of the video Evelyn and the fractionless take over and forbid anyone from leaving, this causes a divide in the people. The fractionless who follow Evelyn and the Allegiant who are in search of the truth and what is really outside the fence. A small group including Tris and Four set out to discover the outside world.<br />After making it outside the group discovers a whole new world filled with terrible secrets and destruction of its own. After discovering everything they have ever known was a lie and now faces a different kind of destruction they must make difficult choices and show true bravery to save their families and their world.<br /><br />This book did not go in the direction I expected and I would just like to give a big thank you to Veronica Roth for that. What an amazing finish to an amazing series. In keeping true to the values and morals she created in her characters this was a truly amazing end. I can see how people would be upset about this final book because it does stray from the typical conclusion that we are used to from this kind of book. However, that is what makes it such an amazing read. As always Veronica Roth draws you into the world she created with her fantastic characters and descriptive writing. Once again you get drawn into the relationship between Tris and Four and how they are able to navigate their relationship when the world around them is falling apart. We are finally told what it really means to be divergent and how that makes them different from everyone else and why the fractions played such an important part in their society.<br /><br />This was a fantastic book and I definitely recommend reading it. Especially those who have read the others and were put off by the negative comments. You do not want tomiss out on the conclusion to this story. This is one of my favorite series and even though it made me ugly cry to finish this series I am beyond amazed by this story. I am definitely a fan of Veronica Roth  and look forward to reading more about Four in the Divergent Story short she is releasing.<br /><br />First I would just like to say I am a bit disappointed in all the reviews posted giving spoilers and not saying they are giving spoilers. Not everyone wants to know what happens before they read the book. Also saddened by the folks posting reviews or negative comments about the book and have not read it. Reading the epilogue and finding out it didn't end the way you wanted and posting about without reading the story it is wrong, and you are missing out on one amazing story
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like this game. It's fun to build and design your own ice village. The graphics are beautiful. The sounds are realistic. It's a little addictive. The only complaints I have is that once I lost the entire game because it would not upgrade. I hope it doesn't do that again. The other complaint is the cost to expand and some of the animals etc. I am a patient person so I plan and wait to purchase after I have earned it, not out of pocket.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|How does one criticize a master? More appropriately, &#34;The Master.&#34; Consequently, I'll make this brief, so as to allow myself time to run away.<br /><br />The story was, for the most part, plodding. While I can understand and appreciate the relevance of the details to some degree, when they begin to interrupt the flow of the story, they engender loss of interest. Much like the an Overlook snowfall, the effort to get through them just wasn't worth it.<br /><br />The outcome was predictable. The good guys won. Unfortunately, the details of their victory were also devoid of interest. I just couldn't find enough to care about them.<br /><br />And that's it. Gotta run!<br /><br />mario

B00AZMFJYA|2.0|Paramount really do think they can milk their customers, don't they? $29.99 RRP for a single disc DVD with no bonus features? As much as I like the movie, I'm giving this one a very low rating for the release itself.<br /><br />I understand about space limitations on DVDs, but offering no option of a 2-disc DVD set and an alternative of a DVD/BR version that only has a small portion of the featurettes is galling. Sorry, Paramount. You could have made more money off of me by releasing a 2-disc DVD set or even a complete set of featurettes on on the DVD/BR version. As it is, I'll stick with the single DVD. I'm a big fan of Star Trek, but I just can't be bothered any more with chasing down bonus features scattered over different formats. Perhaps your company should be weighing the difference in the cash made between those who bought multiple versions of the film to get all the features and those who *would* have paid more for a decent fully-featured version. I suspect the latter amount is much higher.
B00F99EMRE|4.0|First, let me say that the original mix was criminal. Warner/Atlantic should have pulled it from the shelves and re-released it in '02. I'm sure that it wasn't the final mix Rush sent them. It sounds like they mastered it through a TubeScreamer before pressing it. In interviews Geddy has expressed his disatisfaction with the way Atlantic released their music. I just relistened to the original before purchasing the remix and yep, it is still unlistenable. It is so over-compressed that your ears fatigue after 2 or 3 songs to the point you just have to turn it off. It's a shame too, because there are some really good songs on the album. After getting the remix, I loaded it on my IPod and gave it a listen in the car switching back and forth between the original and the new, and the new mix is head and shoulders above the old (how could it not be), to the point I will just delete the old release. There are actually layered vocals and guitars on this album! Without all the over compression you can hear the layers of guitars come into the mix, as well as the multiple layers of vocals. There is space in the mix to let your ears breath and you can listen to the entire album straight through. I bought the original the week it came out and know the album pretty well, and there are parts that you would never have known were there on the original mix. Little guitar flourishes and vocal harmonies pop now, and I am rediscovering all the songs as if they were new.<br />Some small gripes however are, the vocals too me are a little too out front and there is an odd, small room type reverb on them. Believe me, it is a thousand times better than the old mix where the vocals sounded like they were going through a low-fi filter on every song, but still, they could have been pulled back just a hair. The other thing is the eq on the snare sucks. The one thing the old mix has over this one is the punch of the snare, the new mix has a very dull sounding eq on it, where the old was very snappy.<br />All in all, I am very pleased with the remix version and have been listening to it as if it were all new music. Kudos Rush, BOOOO Warner/Atlantic.
B001VU1NJ0|5.0|Great movie originally written by a great author Dennis Lehane.  Sean Penn is perhaps one of our finest actors.  I first saw this movie when it came out in the theaters and knew I wanted to see it again.  I enjoyed it again even after several years later. Disturbing subject but very well written and acted.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This movie is action packed and fun to watch. The cast is amazing. RDJ is the (iron) man! Awesome movie hands down
B006CUDDUG|5.0|Crisp writing. Strong plot and characters. Realistic gritty view of Cold War spy culture. Definitely the antidote to Bond silliness. Poignant and real. So glad I finally got around to reading it.
B004JMY312|4.0|Great movie from my childhood, still watch it every Halloween! There are so many classic lines from this movie...great acting and great fun for the whole family.
B00EP22QKG|4.0|Unvarnished is classic JJ.  Each song rocks Jett style.  This album is a return to her Nortorious and Pure and SImple sound.  Think about it, Pure and Simple, Unvarnished.  Recommended for JJ fans and for those who dig her crunchy guitar and rnr vocals.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Of all the various games I have played on the kindle fire this one is by far the best. I just finished it and am actually annoyed that the room 2 isn't available yet. For $1.99 you just can't go wrong. If you love puzzle games get this one. Graphics are sweet, cool background music.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I had put this book on my wish list since it started out at $10, I was waiting for the price to drop. It dropped and I paid $5 for it. Well worth the price. This was a very good book. Kind of slow at times but worth it. The story line is excellent. I really enjoyed it!!!
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|I bought this to expand the memory in my Synology 1813+. It fit nice and secure and was immediately recognized. So far, so good. SODIMM seems stable and solid.  UPDATE! Have been running this ram for almost a year in one Synology 1813+ and around 8 months in another Synology 1813+.  I have experienced ZERO problems.  This is the good stuff!  Very solid, very stable, no faults. A+ in my book.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|if you use the chromecast for what it is intended for than it is a great tool.....the mirror function is not the best but is not the primary use for it.....once the chromecast adds  more apps like showtime anytime, HBO GO, cinemax on demandg it will be the complete machine
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I just began a free trial and I love it.  Hoping that the full version is inexpensive.  I may take up real golf.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Love the game except when I have saved lives that all of a sudden disappear. What has happened? Please give me back my lives so I can keep playing.........
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm an avid reader of all things Stephen King and this latest book does NOT disappoint.  Couldn't put it down, especially in the dark.  My husband is afraid he'll wake up some morning with a knife in his chest because of these books I read.  Can't wait for the next novel.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love this game me and my frend can get on to each others worlds it is sooo much fun
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|read the title. it wont download. says there in not enough memeory yet i have about  500 mb or so
B00EU9VCKO|1.0|I purchased 3 apps on the same day from Amazon Appstore and one application gave hackers access to my gmail password which they attempted to access from Tel Aviv Israel.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I absolutely loved the first two books, but I must say I'm disappointed in Allegiant.  If anyone should've had a happy ending it should've been Tris and Tobias.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|I thought this was going to be a great movie. I always enjoy Denzel Washington movies. But, this one has the &#34;F&#34; word WAY too much and the nudity at the beginning was not necessary. I was very disappointed with this movie. I will probably end up throwing it away due to the severity of the extremely bad language. It would have been a fairly nice movie if not for all the bad language. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|It was amazing to go back in time to the days when Daria was one of the things I most looked forward to watching. Now I can see it anytime I want!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is both tragic and funny.  John Green is able to blend the two into such a beautiful story of teenagers in love.  The story involves Hazel and Augustus who meet in a cancer survivor group.  The two of them are typical teenagers who are nervous around the opposite sex, text rather than talk on the phone, and think adults don't understand them.  But, they are also not typical teenagers.  Both are cancer survivors and Hazel has lungs that don't work right and force her to drag her oxygen tank with her everywhere.  Hazel is 16 and takes college courses after getting her GED.  Augustus is 19 and was once a star basketball player until he lost his leg to cancer.  The two of them speak in metaphors and quote books while making jokes about their cancer status.  You can't help but find their relationship absolutely adorable, charming, and yet, heartbreaking.<br /><br />As I was reading the book, I was at first surprised that it was labeled as a YA novel.  There were plenty of words used in the book that I didn't know.  Also, the theme of the book was a bit adult at times.  It is written for ages 14 and up, but I would recommend it for maybe 16 or even 17 and up.  I know that our son who will be 14 in 6 months wouldn't \\"get\\" this novel at this point in his life. The story is told from Hazel's perspective and her vocabulary is abnormal from most 16 year-old girls.  She is quite intelligent and well-read.<br /><br />Hazel won me over immediately with her witty banter and the way she was completely literal and straight forward regarding her cancer, how she felt, and what she was thinking.  Hazel said the things most of us thought and wanted to say and made me laugh numerous times. One of my favorite lines in the book is when Hazel is about to leave on a trip, she looks down her blouse and says to her lungs, \\"Keep your sh*t together.\\"<br /><br />The story of Hazel and Augustus will elicit varied emotions as you travel through the pages.  No, they aren't typical teenagers because they have already lived a life most of us will never live.  Keep that in mind as you turn the pages and struggle with their conversations.  Don't let that take away from the underlying message of the story and the relationship Hazel and Augustus have in a much too short story.  Keep a box of kleenex close by.<br /><br />THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is currently be made into a movie which I am super excited about.  It's tentatively scheduled for June 2014 in the US.s because they have already lived a life most of us will never live.  Keep that in mind as you turn the pages and struggle with their conversations.  Don't let that take away from the underlying message of the story and the relationship Hazel and Augustus have in a much too short story.  Keep a box of kleenex close by.<br /><br />THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is currently be made into a movie which I am super excited about.  It's tentatively scheduled for June 2014 in the US.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Well designed, fun, and challenging. I already purchased FAOTD Granny Smith which I though was excellent and was considering getting Sprinkle because it's from the same developer. And today Sprinkle Island is the FAOTD and that just makes me happy.<br /><br />Well worth it for good-looking, responsive, and interesting game play that's a cut above the other apps in this genre.<br /><br />Plus make sure you look out for more apps from this developer. Fingers crossed they too are available as FAOTD.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Fun game it's a little hard in the beginning but it's fun my son loves it. It can be expensive if you are not careful
B0070NSPCU|5.0|One of the best I have read not just recently, but ever. Anthony Ryan does a good job of character building and world building but doesn't lose sight of the fact that a good story should at it's heart be driven by plot - and there is plenty of forward momentum.<br /><br />I have te original author self published version which does have some editorial inconsistencies minor  and maybe they have been cleaned up in the newest versions.<br /><br />Do yourself a face and read this !!
0937381888|4.0|I started brewing not a long time ago (hence not an expert in brewing, but I've been into tasting for several years) and wanted a good book that describes the process of brewing. I hate it when I buy something and figure out that it's cartoon-level material. On the other hand I'm not a microbiologist or chemist (I'm an electrical engineer) so I needed a book with sufficient level of depth. This book has that balance: It is complete, covering all steps of brewing, but not at all hard to understand. Some places in the book the explanations aren't sufficiently well written, or it lacks some (less important) details, which is why I doesn't give it 5 stars. But it's definitely a book worth having in your bookshelf (if you're a brewer).
B008OOYALE|5.0|I think it is great for my kid. My son won't. get off of it.  I recommend it for ages 5 through 12.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|It was all right but kind of boring.  McConaughey was ok but I thought the boys acting was good. I don't even know why Reese Witherspoon was even in it.  She is a better actress than movie that.  This was a C movie.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Whereas the same movie is available in Netflix with below DVD quality. So, watch it on amazon. Oh! The movie is about saving the world and it has been done really good
006202406X|4.0|**Spoilers are below**<br /><br />Let me separate my thoughts into two categories: What I felt and What I know.<br /><br />What I felt: That I expected different things to happen. The whole time I was reading, I felt that the explanations that were being given (about genetics, and the reason for Chicago's existence as an experiment, and I guess what you can label as \\"the plot\\") weren't the truth. I expected there to be a twist, something more concrete--a further betrayal, or explanation, what have you.<br /><br />Not to say that Roth's explanations were bad. They weren't. It's her story, not mine. However, the whole time I was reading, I expected something further to take place, and it didn't.<br /><br />When I began the book, the switching of perspectives threw me off a little. I'm not opposed to switching perspectives, though if that's going to happen, I would rather the writer just write in 3rd person. Granted, I feel this is just a personal preference of mine. I'll address it later under the next category.<br /><br />I felt that the plot just kind of did circular things throughout. Like, that it went all over the place only to resolve little? That probably doesn't make sense. I just felt that the main story line was sporadic in its execution.<br /><br />I didn't like the way that Tris chose to reset the compound's memories. I didn't think that was the diplomatic way of handling that problem. While I was reading, I kept thinking that surely she would just destroy the serum, not release it. However, considering Tris' character, I suppose she was just fulfilling her personality.<br /><br />Those were the big things of what I felt. So, moving on.<br /><br />What I know: That I loved the themes of the book, the whole way through. You know, the Divergent series is all about bravery, and what you define yourself as, and if your actions or what other people say about you define you. It's about identity and knowing who you are--the bad parts and the good. And the thing about Allegiant is that it finally told us what the answer is: your identity is found in many things: your choices, your actions, and the love you share with the people around you.<br /><br />At first, Tris' death didn't seem real to me. I was like, \\"Surely they'll find a way to revive her.\\" But they didn't. She really died. And that struck me as the culmination of a lot of things:<br /><br />Tris has done reckless things throughout the whole series. I believe in the principle that if you do enough things that are reckless, they'll catch up to you. And for Tris, it did. But the thing is--her action of going into that room to release the serum and getting shot, it was an act of selfless defiance. A dual Abnegation/Dauntless action. She took Caleb's place; she showed her love for him by choosing to face death herself. And she defied the Bureau, defied the idea that a person's genes determines their identity, their behavior.<br /><br />So, yeah. Tris died, and that was shocking and painful for me to process. But all along, it was what was meant to happen. There's this term called \\"last stand\\", and that was what Tris did. She stood at her weakest, and was still strong enough to show love for her parents, her brother, her friends, and the people of Chicago--who she spent her whole life living alongside. And that is honorable.<br /><br />The last few chapters that are strictly from Tobias' point of view upset me a good bit. It was painful to read about his pain and his loss and how he just wanted to give up, just because I've felt that way before. I empathized with him.<br /><br />But the last bit of the book, where he's talking about how people are broken and there is going to be hurt in the world, but there's hope, because we can be mended, and that we mend each other: that spoke to me at a deep level.<br /><br />Sometimes I think that it's hard for people who have been hurt to let other people in, to trust other people to see their hurt and scars. But without letting people in--without being brave--one can never truly heal. And that was the lesson I got from this book: To let people in, to trust--so I can heal, and maybe they can too.<br /><br />Overall: Allegiant wasn't what I was expecting. But it did teach me a lesson and it spoke to the deeper parts of me. And that's what makes a book truly successful: if it has changed you, or given you a part of yourself back. And Allegiant did that, for me.<br /><br />So thank you, Veronica Roth, for being an amazing storyteller, and for allowing me to read your books. I want to say that they have shaped me into a better person.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Well, hmm, this movie had everything you would need to walk away happy: Good special effects, very funny, decent story, great bad guy, and some of the best superheroes in the Marvel Universe, and it all wrapped up into a great movie. Thank you Joss Whedon for making this film, and I hope the sequel is just as good, if not better, if that is even possible.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|not the best choice for a 3d movie but okay. i like ridley scotts movies, so if you're a fan of his then pick this one up
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|When Pacific Rim was at the theaters, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not. The previews of it looked cool, but that doesn't always mean it will be a great movie. In any case, I ended up watching the movie twice at the theaters, once in regular 2D and then again in Imax 3D. The only major difference between 2D and 3D was the Imax sound quality was much better. As I watching this movie, especially how it starts off in the beginning, I was emotionally charged thinking \\"Kick that monster's ass\\" by the fight scenes with the robots battling the monsters, the dramatic scenes, and the special effects were awesome as well. This is a great movie, honestly the biggest surprise of the summer, and if you grew up when the Godzilla movies were on tv, then this movie should be apart of your collection. I have watched it 10 times on DVD, and I can't wait for the sequel. For anyone who hasn't seen this movie, rent it, because honestly you are missing out on an awesome movie.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|i've wanted this for a while, then found this great deal. thanks again. safer package would be nice, but otherwise it was okay.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds are perfect together. Two of the most dynamic performers in the business. Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson and Betty White round out a super cast that makes for a funny, but touching show.  One you'll want to see again.
B000TGCR42|5.0|this will be one of my most favourite possessions. this film reminds of something ive always dreamed of doing. and that to imagine myself that my town is beautiful. get it. its a great pick.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Brad Pitt is typically great in this show. Not the usual, tired zombie apocalypse flick. Zombies are lightning fast and humans transform in minutes. Many intense, graphic and suspenseful moments from start to finish. As far as zombie movies go, definitely one of the best I've seen.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|minions are cute and are in this amazing game I love it. they change debinding on the season at least the resadintial area the best is it is FREE!
B006C45MRE|5.0|Pure entertainment. Farfetched, old west, superhero movie unlike any I've ever seen. Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford take what could have been a lame disaster and turn it into a fun ride. CGI aliens are well done, and movie plays out with just enough campiness to keep you from taking it too seriously. Good movie to watch for just escapist enjoyment.
B000001EHS|5.0|I also wish I could just rate something without writing a review. I am old enough to have grown up with the early stages of rock and roll. This is classic!
159463176X|3.0|I am slightly disappointed in this third collection from Hosseini. His previous two books were wonderful, especially A Thousand Spledid Suns. It seems like a lot of \\"fill\\" in this book, only to finally end with the beginning characters. Glad I'm done reading it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I wish I could buy the season cheaper.  I also wish I could just rate something without writing a review. I am old enough to have grown up with the early stages of rock and roll. This is classic!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad this is finally on kindle love it easy to play but challenging also awesome way to spend down time
B0084HJE0S|2.0|This is only a narrative with little examples.  If you are looking to learn about the evolution of the technology or a brief explanation of the subject then this fine.  If you are wanting to learn through some practical examples then it is not a good fit.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|Excellent but I would need spanish to portuguese and spanish to Italian. Very interesting the manner to teach a new language

006202406X|3.0|I won't bother with plot recaps in this review, but I will share my feelings about this book. I looked forward to it for quite some time, as did many fans of the trilogy. I'd give it three stars for a couple of reasons. I personally think trying to portray the emotion and reaction of people who discover they're all basically lab rats in an experiment is an incredibly challenging subject matter. The disappointing thing for me is how shallow the reactions are from the characters. They seem to nod and absorb the information, or information overload as it were. It's almost a numbness. The airplane ride, the tablets, the computers, the wide, wide world in which they live: it is so nonchalant. There are twists that feel cut off. Sometimes I feel like the book should've been longer, more fleshed out, so we could feel the confusion, the chaos, the shell shock that our characters must have gone through. Instead, they fall right into their roles. It felt rushed. From a generalized standpoint, the plot was believable, but the characters reactions to their surrounding just weren't for me. They grew, the matured, they developed, they forgave, they were human. But, it wasn't the strong finish I had hoped for, and it left me feeling like I wish I'd left off reading after Tris and Four forgave each other. For me the book ended when Tris realized that a mature relationship was one in which you must choose to love every day.<br /><br /> ***THE REMAINDER OF THIS  REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, SO DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING!***<br /><br />When they return from the outside, they're just accepted. It's okay. Peace, love, and happiness, and Marcus slinks quietly away to find absolute power somewhere else. Really? Some things just get glossed over, and I wanted to see and feel and live the reactions. Maybe my heart for this story died with Tris. Maybe I should reread it. But knowing the end, I can't. From a plot and storyline perspective, if I was just reading a synopsis, I like the story and felt it a believable outcome.<br /><br />One of the better parts for me is the off the cuff change of plans that Four employs at the end. He finally trusts himself. He finally grows into a person who can find the end without means that are destructive. And, just as he grows, he loses the one person he loves the most. As he gains the love of his mother, he loses Tris. Evelyn's ominous foreshadowing (you will never be in the new world with my son) comes to bear. I understand the author's point, but the fact that this story ends without a chance at happiness for some of my favorite characters knocks it right off of my re-read list. Kind of like Game of Thrones. As long as I don't open book 5, Arya lives. So I will never read it (until George RR Martin assures me she lives, which he won't!). While I thought the plot was well conceived and a fitting end, it is heart wrenching that Tris never gets to see the peace she enables. But that's life. Stark realism. But, in life, there are many ways to be happy and find happiness and I (as many readers) would've rather seen David die than Tris. In the end, a simple bullet kills her. Maybe in a world so dedicated to peace there wouldn't be a place for Tris. But, in the end, I feel like Four. I'm moving forward, but there's a hole in my heart where an amazing ending should be.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app/game is amazing! Most of you probably know this if you have a different device that has the app store. Finally amazon has it!!! However, if you don't know this, it's a logic puzzle game that is so fun! (Warning: and also VERY addicting) There are 100s and 100s of levels, and I love the setting/mood that it is candy! Love it!
006202406X|2.0|I know all you who love this series will read this and be like yeah fright of course I want to read it. I am being completely honest with you, it will destroy you and your love for these books. It is not the ending you want and you will never be able to read these books again. Come up with your own ending and you will be much happier. Oh and honestly this is pretty much the same as the second one, no change in plot and pretty dry.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Good game.  Fun addicting and a time killer.  Good graphics.  Wish it wasnt so the same thing round after round and the items in the store are way to expensive.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book because it was like a roller coaster ride. I was sad, happy, humored, and excited all at the same time. That is what a great book does.
B004UNX1LS|2.0|This app is great, when it works! This app always messes up. It cuts of songs I play and tells ...me vevo is not responding? Do not download this app too many bugs !
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|From the age of 6 my son became a full blown Trekkie. He had a great collection of figures, movies & etc; He died Jan 22, 2012 at age 36. I bought this so I can watch and remember with happiness how much he enjoyed Star Trek. I'm very pleased with the service I received.  Thank you.
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|its not on my kindle could not play the game there is nothing to review did not have a chance to play the game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun.  It is addictive to where you don't want to put the game down.  This is one game that I would recommend to anyone who likes to play match 3 games
B00A757EFW|4.0|Pac man lite is just like the arcade game! There is still inky blinky and sue and the others, but there is just a certain spark to the old arcade game that isn't on the tablet edition. This game is still fun, and I still like escaping the thingies that Chase Pac man, but I still think that the arcade game is more fun. What can you expect? The game is free. I guess paying a quarter makes better quality. I would buy this game, though.
B00E7RZEI0|1.0|Seemed like it would be fun but Security on my phone said its spyware! If already downloaded please uninstall. I already notified appstore.
B00DVKOYBM|3.0|I've tried many other online pool games in the past. This one is the closest to playing on a actual table. The only thing that I wish was different is that you shouldn't have a time limit to take a shot. For players who are not used to playing this type of online games.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Like the fact that it turns the device off/on by opening & closing. I just wish it had a small pocket to store the power cord.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a very good game, the fact that it is free was awesome. Definitely worth the download. You can fight with and upgrade your robots. It's cool.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Loved the story - great creativity and great writing - love Elizabeth - she has a winner - look forward to more books from her.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|A satisfying book. No, it wasn't as scary as the Shining but few books are. I don't read as much horror as I did when I was younger. As you get older real life is scary enough, but I still read Stephen King. I trust him as the guide who will get me safely through whatever terrors await me in the pages. Hard to say too much without spoilers but one thing that stood out to me was the way the evil, awful members of the True Knot loved and grieved for each other. In books the power of love is usually only portrayed as belonging to the &#34;good&#34; side but of course in real life we know it can also be twisted and destructive. I felt satisfied at the end of the book, but we might need a sequel about Abra in a few years.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I bought this because<br /><br />1. it was only $35<br />2. It seems to be a cool new toy<br />3. it's really small so you can take it with you when you travel<br /><br />I give it only four stars, because it's still being developed.  It supports Youtube, Google Play, &#34;chromcasting*&#34;, and Netflix right now.  I'm hoping they add PlayOn soon.  Basically it's a Roku on a stick.  The fact that Google is developing it gives me hope that there'll many more apps coming.<br /><br />*I mentioned &#34;chromecasting&#34; above. What I mean is you can share you chrome browser screen from you PC as well.
0525478817|5.0|Brilliantly written, captures acerbic wit<br />and emotional intelligence of two teens in a life-challenging situation. Should be required reading for high-school students.
B00AGYM0DU|5.0|A stunning emotional journey that captures mindfulness in its true purity . I just hope in all the reviews that have been written that  just one reader sees my review and picks up this  beautiful book so that the  beauty  and authenticity of this story can unfold from moment to moment to you.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|I love Whitney Houston and her videos. They are fun to wattch; My favorite video is the greatest love of all and I have nothing..
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Just like the title says, I've got 519 MB of free app space, but it won't install. Bummer. I was looking forward to trying it out.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The best waste of time I've found in a long time. And the price is right.  Get the app now.
B00F8OUBXE|5.0|This is the best work Metal Church has released since the 80s!  Its been on repeat since I received it.  Nice work!
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|SO excited to wake up and find this on my Kindle, started it right away. it's different, some Jones fan will not be happy with a major plot point but as always, we're on Bridget's side  as she battles thru her new life.
B00A7MSHHO|4.0|Any hobby should be fun and collecting action figures is no different. This figure is fun! It's not perfect and there could be more bang for your buck, but if you enjoy movie version action figures like I do, then do yourself a favor and get this guy into your collection. I shopped around for the best deal and I found it here on Amazon.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|I like the game BUT it kicks you off Wi-Fi with full service when I visit other farms and at other times for no reason. I wish this was fixed because it takes too much time to reload. Losing interest!!!farm ID EADUJEZ
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|I'm a big fan of Whitney's so I love the single set of all her greatest hits.  I will always love you Whitney!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The two point of views was annoying as hell. It made Four come across as weak and indecisive. The GD & GP was so repetitive. The  whole big brother was just brushed over. As soon as they found out they were being watched, they should have went back to the city and told everybody. &#34;hey guys, yall are all part of an experiment, yeah, your whole life is being filmed for the gov't to test y'alls genes. This conflict you all are having is just a joke&#34; Then to end the war all Four had to do was ask his mommy to stop. Couldn't he have done that on page 1?<br />I've seen other reviews saying that Ms. Roth is very brave to have Tris die. Uh no! That was some bs! We all grew to love Tris and to have her die in that way, just suck. It was already a bad book with an awful ending. Just a waste of time and I am sorry to all those I recommend this series too.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|So far I like this book. If you like supernatural romance books this will probably be for you, so enjoy this
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Great for people of all ages. My God son loves this game and it keeps him busy. I loved the movie and the game is just a nice
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I am sad for two reasons. One is because it ended and the other is, well, obvious (I won't spoil it here). It was hard for me to accept the ending but that does not make this book a 1 star rating. Veronica did a great job pulling me in to her world and truly contemplate the ideas portrayed. The ending was beautiful and thought provoking. I cried like a baby. Even though  I was hoping for a happily ever after, this ending was honest and realistic.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Nice to be able to take my tablet so I have access to all the other stuff and still get my book(s)  to read.  I really love it.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Did not regret buying this set.  Enjoying  watching each one way better than my old vhs tapes.  Anyone will enjoy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am hooked on the hunger games! This is a great book easy read. Warning once you start reading you won't be able to stop!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|One of those &#34;can't put down&#34; books - Tho I understand the need for such a profession, I am saddened that it has to be this way
B00CWY76CC|5.0|There were only 10 levels and I beat them all pretty quickly but it was fun! I will be watching for more levels to come out
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|i couldnt say if this game is good or bad because it wont download, its charged me 2 times already and keeps saying there is an error downloading plz try again and it makes me mad. if u could help me at all post another review plz
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Loved it But really wished it was a little longer I wish mr king would of got deeper into the True Knot clan
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It was a little complicated at first but got easier with continued use. I like all<br />the different clock faces.
B002CM03PQ|5.0|The additional features on the DVDs are great.  The director's cut is a great improvement, and documentaries are short, but fascinating, especially the technical information.  I could do without all the rest of the stuff, but at least it's mostly recyclable!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I found this game super fun. If you like puzzles and mystery then this is the perfect game for you. I was super addicted until I finished it. It's not super hard, though It's not that simple either. It literally makes you think outside the box and you have to pay attention to EVERY DETAIL. It also has a really good story with it. It took me about three days to finish it. Can't wait for the next one to come out. I hope you find this review helpful.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Can't stop playing this game. Wish I had endless lives forever as it's frustrating to just miss getting through a level and not have any more lives to get to the next level. Stripes and Sprinkle bombs with a little strategy is mind boggling at times
B00992CF6W|5.0|This was a great app love it the app ever maybe. I truly prefer this to minecraft fans and even anyone . I really hope they make caves ravines and spawners and unlimited worlds. But for 6.99 it's worth it
B000ID37KO|5.0|A little campy, but I still love this Hitchcock Classic. Tippi Hedren is just wonderful in what I believe was her very first movie. The plot is just too original for words, too.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Love this game. It is very fun and I could play ot for hours... love this game. I recommend to anyone
B00AZ7V0W0|3.0|It is nice to have all of the Elm street collection on blu-ray. The discs that I have viewed look nice. The set is advertized as having the 3D version of Freddy'd Dead which is not here. That is the biggest let down, so far I'm pleased with the rest of the collection.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|It was satisfying to see all of the disparate superheros cooperate in defeating the bad guy. Two hours of solid action fun.
B000002J1M|5.0|I have nothing to add to the 5-star reviews already written here. Superb album from beginning to end. Along with Selling England By the Pound and The Lamb lies down on Broadway, these are the best three albums Genesis ever did.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|It is a great cast and very interesting story lines. It keeps you coming back for more. We are looking forward to the next season.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It is no secret that I love &#34;Divergent&#34;- by the end of the semester of my YA class I am sure that the majority of my classmates (not to mention prof) wanted to pull some Tris-like moves on me for CONSTANTLY pushing it on them. That being said, a lot of that love was unfortunately lost on &#34;Insurgent&#34;, with me feeling that it lost too much of the magic from the previous book- with Tris and Four's relationship constantly balancing precariously over the chasm, Tris refusing to give in any way, shape, or form, and so forth. As such, on the one hand I was beyond excited to read this book (thinking that &#34;Insurgent&#34; merely suffered from second book syndrome and that Veronica would redeem herself), but on the other, I was nervous beyond belief (based upon the previous two books it stood to reason that there would be a lot of conflict, violence, and loss in this)- at times, giving myself a stomach ache when thinking about actually reading it.<br /><br />My biggest worries about this book surrounded its ending because I heard vague whispers that THINGS WENT DOWN- as such, I was convinced before even starting it that I would hate it. However, surprisingly, I did not hate the ending, it wasn't near as hard to accept as I had thought that it would be (Plus, I give mad props to Veronica for doing what she did- it's something that I have literally never seen another author do before, them always chickening out at the last minute. She's going to get a lot of hate for it, but when you really think about it, it totally fits with the overall scheme of things). Furthermore, the last twenty or so pages of this book were absolutely gorgeous- I don't often cry while reading a book, but there was definitely some tearing up going on as I read them. Based on the ending alone, I would give the book 5 stars.<br /><br />Furthermore, I did like the fact that from book to book you can see massive character growth- growth seen in Tris and Four especially (something that really became clear to me as I (re)read all three books in the course of two days). Also, the vulnerability exhibited by all of the characters made them extremely relatable and helped me to understand why they did what they did- even those characters that I swore that I would hate until the end of my days, for instance, Peter and Caleb. Last, I did like the duo POV in this book (I always love me some male POV), however, I can't help but wish that Tris and Four's voices were a bit more ferreted out, it was, at times, difficult to determine whose head you actually were in, since they sounded so similar.<br /><br />That being said, what I did hate about the book, and what did drag down the star rating, was how often Veronica put us through the ringer- with petty, jealous high school drama, further conflict after conflict between Tris and Four (I mean, didn't we get enough of this in &#34;Insurgent&#34;- we get it, relationships are hard and need work, trust isn't a given, and so forth), and an inundated storyline (you thought that the faction system in the first two books was confusing? It's NOTHING compared to all of the layers of politics and whatnot going on in this book- kitchen sink, anyone?). Furthermore, I was not a fan of the pace of the book, the setting of much of it, and I absolutely loathed the new character additions (with the exception of one). Combined, around the 350 page mark, I was about to give up on the book because I was just so angry with everything going on.<br /><br />All in all, for me personally it's a toss-up between three and four stars. Overall, I'm glad that I pushed through and didn't give up on the book. While there is admittedly a part of me does wish that this book did end a different way, as I mentioned, I do think that it is what was truly needed and I appreciate Veronica for having the balls to do so. It's clear that she is the most Dauntless person around. Furthermore, I really and truly do hope that Veronica does continue to write after this, not becoming one of those authors like Stephenie Meyer or Suzanne Collins who seemingly drops off the face of the planet after their massive success.er this, not becoming one of those authors like Stephenie Meyer or Suzanne Collins who seemingly drops off the face of the planet after their massive success.
B008JFUR10|1.0|Not much of a script.  Not much good dialog.  No sub-titles at all, so you have to have the thing just blasting loud to hear the mumbled conversations.  Pompous Jaeger drivers who obviously are suffering from testosterone poisoning.  Illogical aliens who invade this planet by knocking down buildings of coastal cities.  Includes a very one-dimensional female, though she is a good counterpart for the very one-dimensional male.  Could have been a great movie.  They sure had the monsters and the Jaegers down pat.  Sorry I bought it.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Um it a good book i guss so you should get it<br />  I i i i imi i i i get it and also get false prince
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a nice easy version to pass time while waiting for the light to change. Several situations lend itself to playing while waiting and its fun.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|Loved this book! The two young ladies, who are the main characters, are real, flawed, and multi-dimensional. Figuring out who you really are, what your core values are, actually being the best version of yourself, and having the courage to be that person to the world are key themes within this love story. And, yes, it is a love story. One of the most honest and challenging traits of true love is self-sacrifice, and Kendall and Payton learn, and apply, that tough lesson.<br />This story has mature themes, so it is appropriate for 16+. THE GRAVITY BETWEEN US is a great read for anyone coming out, considering coming out, or even a highly enjoyable read for anyone that is simply looking for a tale of romance.  This story may occur in Hollywood and contain issues surrounding celebrity, but take away the money and fame, and the difficulty faced could be long to anyone, rich or poor, and the love and friendship rings true, no matter who you are or where you live.
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|I ordered this from Amazon UK, recieved it yesterday and have listened many times already.  It is different from Together, but just as enjoyable. I don't love every song choice, but I do like that fact that there are both duets and solos. I think Charlotte has a crystal clear voice which is beautiful . Jonathan's voice gives me goosebumps.  I think it is easier to hear their voices both as solos and duet on this CD. Together seemed overorchestrated. Perhaps Love is one of my favorite songs and I really love a few others. I could do without O Solo Mio, but there are enough good songs. You cannot help but love this pair.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hosseini's words flow so beautifully off the page. I love how he fills out the world of his story and sucks you in, knowing when to stop and move forward (unlike some other writers I love but get annoyed with Anne Rice!)<br /><br />Another well crafted story. It took a little time to get into. This multi generation, multi country and eras maintains the thread of global connection lightly, but with an ending that felt complete and satisfying.<br /><br />If you loved kite runner and thousand splendid suns you'll enjoy this also
B0002LMLSQ|5.0|This is an ideal CD to listen to when sitting in contemplation, journaling or just using as soothing background music.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|absolute masterpiece,fantastic music, a surefire grammy winner this year, best blues music i have heard from my buddy since sweet tea,dont miss this one
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I really like this game.  Graphics are great, areas become harder and harder as you go back to search them and the obstacles change.  I do not like having to actually buy time to play the game.  Did not understand that when I purchased the game.  I thought I would be purchasing the rest of the game after the free trial.  Hence the four stars.  I mostly wait until the next day to play when energy is restored.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|Good plot, great animation, funny characters.  A little violent and fast moving for younger kids, great for older kids (over7) fun for the whole family.
B003H4I4JU|2.0|I had really high hopes for Speaker for the Dead: 2 after reading Enders Game.  This is a continuation of sorts.  It's a decent story but really hard to follow due to all the foreign language and references to foreign languages. Portugese?  Why?  Enders Game seems to have been written by a totally different person.  I bought the rest of the series, so I'm still hopeful it gets better...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just as addicting to play it on the Kindle. Syncs up to Facebook and you're good to go. Doesn't crash or give any problems since I downloaded the app
B0049VZ222|5.0|Loved it, watched in a marathon it was so addictive.  Totally worth $11.00, I'd recommend this purchase if you love zombies and edge of your seat thrills.
B00000IQCA|3.0|A complete hodgepodge of intersecting and interwoven and conflicting storylines make up the lavishly entertaining yet uniformly mediocre `Pret-a-Porter', a film that has charm and pizzazz and yet lacks a lot of everything else.  With an inspired cast that makes the most of their character's bounty of wit and sarcasm, `Pret-a-Porter' feels like Robert Altman lite, capitalizing on his obvious signature construction and yet failing to feel inspired.  It's fun, but shallow, and while it tries to give the façade of something more, it is nothing more than just that; a façade.  In a world obsessed with fashion and reality shows like `Project Runway', `Pret-a-Porter' may find a nice audience in the here and now, but it has about as much substance as those reality shows as well, so if you want to look at pretty clothes and catty people, this will make your day.  An insightful satire, this is not, even though it wants so badly to be.  Forest Whitaker and Kim Basinger are best in show here and deliver hilarious supporting roles that are bound to steal your attention.  If you are new to Altman though, this could be deceiving.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I had no problems it works just as good as if you where using an apple device and it has more features then using the app provided
6305428522|4.0|I just had this feeling that `Quiz Show' was going to be a complete bore.  I was holding off watching it for the longest time, and yet settling in to watch it over the past weekend was a complete joy.  Despite running over two hours, the film has such natural flow to it that you can't help but be absorbed in it from scene to scene.<br /><br />Bravo to Paul Attanasio for his exceptional screenplay.<br /><br />The film, taking place in the 60's, tells the true story of a young reporter who uncovers a scandal in `quiz show' television when he becomes aware that the winners are being fed the answers to fix the show and garner higher ratings.  When young Jewish `every man' Herbie Stempel plateaus with the show `Twenty-One', the producers convince him to throw the game and elect the young, good looking and financially stable Charles Can Doren as the new winner.  He skyrockets to fame because of his charm and soon becomes the biggest winner the show ever had.  And then the reporters come and the allegations come and the pressure pushes down on him and the producers to save face.<br /><br />Quickly.<br /><br />Robert Redford does a great job of pacing his film, giving us just enough to keep us hooked and keep the film flowing, and he manages to splice together different plot points and character arcs with an ease and naturalness.  The cast is also exceptional, with Fiennes charming the pants off the audience and John Turturro delivering a remarkably layered performance as the jilted Herbie Stempel.  It appears that he and Scofield were really neck and neck in the Oscar race (Scofield was nominated for BAFTA and Oscar, while Turturro was nominated for the Globe and SAG) and I really wish that Turturro had prevailed, since he really is the best part of the film.<br /><br />With snappy dialog, rich production values and an ensemble who sells every note (Paymer and Azaria are a marvelous pair), `Quiz Show' gets so much right I can't help but love it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My 8 year old son loves this app and says it is his favorite!  Takes some strategic thinking...I like it too!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game. It's fun and challenging. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves shooting games.
B005DOKK7Q|4.0|This was just as advertised. The color wasn't as bright as I thought it would be.. Works great.<br />Other reviewers stated a strong smell. I didn't notice. Smelled like new.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't believe he did this to woman,if I was Miss.Steele I would kick his ass and leave him in a giffy.
B000002LIX|3.0|For years I've liked the few Jane's Addiction songs that I sometimes hear on the radio.  Not that I normally seek out listening to the radio of course since it's a generic wasteland of playing the same few songs over and over, but when it's on Jane's Addiction's music usually stands out the most in a positive way.<br /><br />However trying to patiently sit through an entire album with Perry Farrell singing nonstop and hitting many of the soaring notes that he really has no business trying to hit because his range isn't acceptable enough, is sort of hard to tolerate after a while.  Don't get me wrong, he can sing appropriately *sometimes* such as on, the classic, \\"Three Days\\".  The way he sings \\"Shadows of the morning light, the shadows of the evening sun, til the shadows and the light were one\\" is a *magnificent* line, and clearly the best moment of the entire Ritual De Lo Habitual album.  It makes me think of the more soaring moments of legendary rock bands from previous generations.<br /><br />Even though technically Jane's Addiction is an alternative rock/metal band, I feel there's more to them than simply that.  They also, I believe at least, possess space rock influences.  Not only that, but it's a unique kind of space rock the likes of which Pink Floyd or Rush never had.  Due to Dave Navarro's guitar playing, Jane's Addiction often reminds me of adventurous outerspace journeys which may be intentional or not- don't really know what others think about that one.  \\"Been Caught Stealing\\" is another memorable song.  Perry's vocals aren't as intolerable on this track, even though they should be because he's not really singing any differently here compared to the first few songs.  I'm also rather fond of the calm and imaginative way \\"Then She Did\\" develops.  This is another really good tune, though 8 minutes is a couple minutes overlong I think.<br /><br />However the first few songs sound like total noise to me.  Not only does Perry not understand when to keep his vocals under control (because he sounds like he's just blurting out vocals whenever he feels like) but the vocal melodies themselves aren't distinctive or interesting enough to keep my attention.  Jane's Addiction is easily a more improved band when they're writing lengthier songs in my opinion.  Perry knows how to either control or utilize his voice on the lengthier songs.  Keep the short songs faraway from him because they scream filler to me.  Also, \\"Of Course\\" is an awesome song.  Again, Perry's vocals work here.  Keep him away from shorter songs, based entirely on my experience with this album.  Maybe he's better on other albums.<br /><br />So basically Dave Navarro has a wonderful guitar tone, Stephen Perkins drumming is really good too, and Perry Farrell *can* be good when he's not over-singing his lines.  When he keeps his vocals under control, which he often does on the more epic/longer tunes throughout Ritual De Lo Habitual (except for \\"Of Course\\" or when the guitar work covers up most of his vocals on \\"Three Days\\") his voice and vocal style is more appropriate then.  All just opinion of course.  Still a very good band with a distinctive style, and a good album.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Many times I feel that books are too redundant. They copy each other. But in allegiant I found a new experience. In the first two books we grow close t  the characters. We feel their pain,loss, and humanity. We mourn their deaths and we feel their hope. In allegiant I changed. The reader became the characters.  We laughed,cited,and smiled with them.  Moreover we experienced. In the endless  I put the book down with tears streaming down my face. Not for the loss but for the beginnings<br />Thank you Ms.Roth, for giving us hope an  teaching us bravery. Than  you for the journey you gag  the reader
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game ever I love the Victor challenges!!!!! I love this game you should try it. awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002SJ8FH6|5.0|I love this classic and have seen it previously.  The picture quality of this was decent, but the sound quality was very tinny- almost to the point of hurting your ears.  We had to turn it up quite loud to hear.  Really glad it's available for instant viewing, so I'm still rating it 5 stars.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Lots of fun. You WILL get addicted. I suspend way too much time on this when I should be doing educational games. Have fun!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|The game is a beautiful experience. It's mysterious, enthralling and emotional at times.  It's one of the best games I have ever played and by far the best game on PS3 for me.<br /><br />Atmosphere is everything in Journey, the experience of being in this world will make you want to experience more and more and it will be very hard to put the controller down.<br /><br />Without wanting to give any spoilers, when you start the game you will have questions and when the game ends you will have more questions...they are left to the imagination of the player.<br /><br />The only negative I can point out is that you will get through Journey in a 3 hour session, but the experience is so captivating that it's worth every penny.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this game.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Love this CD! It is a great album and I want more if his stuff.  After watching the movie, I found this on Amazon.  I receved this super quick.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addictive and frustrating sometimes too. I tried to resist it, but I just couldn't. I gave in and now I'm hooked.
B00C76076C|5.0|I bought it for my grandchildren and they are enjoying watching it! I highly recommend it for children and adults!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Ever note has been fantastic in helping us to eliminate paper around the house and consolidate everything in one place. I absolutely love the ability to search through all notes, whether handwritten, PDA, whatever. Very useful.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Absolutely disgusting, so disappointed in the ending. Can't believe she killed off the main character. Wish I wouldn't have read it.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|When I bought  this book I had a lot of  expectations as I was wrote by a professional trying to find scientist  information but his book is very disappointed, dont have a credible testimony  as he started to talk about the experience I got so bore think  the illness made him delusional and still he has some mental issues.  Wasted my money reading a bunch of garbage
0307744434|5.0|VERY much enjoyed this book, although sometimes felt conflicted about the emotional motivations of the characters. However, the fact that I got invested enough in the characters to have that kind of a reaction should say something about the story. THe visual are lush and amazing - this book it ripe for adaptation to screen. Would love to see it as a live action or animated movie!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is awesome I highly recommend reading this book there is so much in this book they can't possibly put in the movie if you are a fan of sci-fi then this is a book that is a must read
B00G03LDSO|5.0|Been a fan for years and always loved P.O.D. Its good to see they're still being them! Alot of extras for hardcore fans such as myself. A must have especially if you didnt buy the original murdered love
B008LV8TSU|5.0|It was fantastic an amazing book that really kept you reading . You will never be able to put it down.
B006PGL7OQ|5.0|Michael Shannon seems to have put his heart in this project. I was blown away by his ability to pull this character off. There were plenty of memorably scenes and a few spectacular monologues. If I had an Oscar to give out, I'd make sure that he, along with the movie itself, received one.
B0080R3PSE|4.0|I purchased this book after a recommendation from my neighbor.  Before receiving this book, I had no plans of a natural birth, but did not feel overly worried about the labor and delivery process.  However, I was only 3 months along with our first child when ordering, so maybe the horror stories that everyone tells you hadn't had time to set in.  Upon reading this book, I felt that this book was very comforting.  I had not given my future birthing experience much thought, but am sure that I would have been very stressed when it came time for the birth of our child.  After reading this, I think that I will be much more relaxed when the time comes to welcome our new little bundle of joy into this world.  I cannot say that I have changed my mind to have a natural childbirth, but would like to wait until I actually start contractions and dilating before making a decision about pain medication.  I would definitely recommend this book to a friend, as I feel that it makes you feel more prepared and calm about the birthing experience.  I know many of my pregnant friends are simply terrified at the thought of birth, but I feel very relaxed.  I think part of the reason was due to this book.  Even though I do not plan to follow all of the advise in this book, it was still worth the money and the time reading it.
B006S08RLU|5.0|Absolutely great movie. Two words to describe it are lighthearted and inspiring. Amelie was everything I wanted from it. It was funny, lighthearted, and inspiring at the same time. Very interesting and original style.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have been using the Chromecast device for about 3 weeks now and have been very impressed by it.  The device easily sets up and can stream Netflix movies quickly and efficiently.  I have also used it to stream media from other sites (abc.com, Fox.com, etc.) by streaming the tab in Google Chrome and making the media go to full screen.  Great streaming device for a great price.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Loved it. Made me think about (and appreciate) how good most people have life today as opposed to the 1930's when there wasn't much government support for people who truly needed help. The book also pointed out the fact fact that human nature has not changed, i.e., there are always those who unselfishly help others in need, and there are always others who selfishly take advantage of those in need.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Beautiful, seamless game play. Absolutely amazing and fun and addictive. Be careful you don't get sucked in. Edited so long for this to come to the kindle... now, bring us Farm Heroes Saga...
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I have read it twice...and it awesome each time.  Tina is authentic and hysterical.  SNL, puberty, struggles - thank you for sharing it with...everyone!

B00CL0J99K|5.0|In a surprising turn of events, Marvel/Disney chose to forgo the typical by-the-numbers superhero formula, and craft something far different for this installment of Iron Man- a movie wherein the protagonists's flaws and weaknesses are highlighted, as opposed to his propensity for banter and ass-kicking (which are still present, mind you). The result of these efforts (and they are darned good efforts, so hats off the writers), is a story in which our superhero feels much more HUMAN, as opposed to SUPERHUMAN, and this works well. The end of the world scenario is fine for superhero movies, but it's been done so many times now, it lacks novelty or any real sense of urgency. This movie's more focused plot (with smaller stakes) is more in line with something like \\"Kick Ass\\", where the emphasis is on a more personal level, and in my book, way more effective. There's still special effects and beat-downs galore, so this series has not turned into a Hallmark movie or anything- it's just more intelligent now. Blu-ray transfer is phenomenal, as usual, for recent big budget movies. Great flick, great fun!
B007HO392S|2.0|the cd cover was cracked and dusty. the music was good. just didn't enjoy the fact that the cd ablum wasn't.

B006G2NVCA|3.0|GWTDT, is an okay soundtrack/score offering from Trent, but drone, drone, drone on it does.<br />After The social network this, one isn't much of an improvement.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|I loved this book, I mean I saw the movie but this is a way better story. Honestly, the percy Jackson series is the best series to me!
B00EAH3GHI|5.0|Great concert. Great DVD, glad to have the extras as well. For me, the extras sold did it for me. I've noticed a few different camera shots throughout the concert (since I have the old VHS quality bootleg of it). 20 years, well worth it.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book was awesome and mind blowing at the sequence of events. It still has those funny moments but also packs a lot of action and I highly recommend this book!!!!!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This little device is great for streaming netflix or anything on your google chrome web browser.  I have found it is a bit buggy when streaming from my phone (Galaxy Note 2).  The netflix app has some quirky things to it that you need a little troubleshooting ability to fix.  Sometimes the icon to send to google chromecast doesn't show up.  Sometimes it does but it doesn't do anything.  Sometimes netflix will fail to load off of chromecast and you will need to reset the power.  Sometimes your phone will say chromecast is playing something off netflix but your tv won't budge (typically happens when you start something while netflix is loading on the tv).<br /><br />Besides all the quirks I've been immensely satisfied with this product.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|excellent game buy too short! Only 10 levels... Waitting for the next  to keep playing and having fun! :) .
B00FVAEKJ6|4.0|This is my second FlipPix Art collection and I'm enjoying these little logic puzzles quite a bit.  This collection contains 252 puzzles, one of the most puzzles for a collection for FlipPix.  Some might say they like more objects per scene, but seriously, what does it matter, it's about the puzzles, not the images.<br /><br />I do have one issue with the 20 x 20 puzzles, and that is they do get rather small for some screen sizes.  Keep this in mind when you purchase this app.  I run it on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and my stylus would not be able to handle a smaller screen.  In all fairness though, my stylus is more like a pencil/eraser than a tiny toothpick.<br /><br />It would be my suggestion that after completion of all of the puzzles, the game gives an overall rating/percentage to the player.  Maybe incorporate a timer for an even harder level of difficulty.  It is for these &#34;minor&#34; reasons alone I only give it 4 stars.  If this was the first release of the game collection for GabySoft, I would have easily given them 5 stars, but after several collections, one would have thought the developer would have come up with more features to the game, and not just new images.<br /><br />Looking forward to more FlipPix releases.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS IS THE MOST AWESOMELY AWESOME GAME EVER CREATED!!!  I play this game every chance I get, at school, at home, everywhere. The only thing that needs to be done is that you need to download this game now! It will be the best decision of you like

006202406X|4.0|I finished the book earlier today after hesitating to even purchase because of the negative reviews. I am glad that a decided to find out for myself. This review contains spoilers.<br /><br />This book definitely has some issues.  Tris and Four have such similar internal monologues that sometimes I forgot which character's head i was currently inside.  The plot points in the middle of the story are at times hazy, with four or five revolutions and counter revolutions happening inside and outside the city within maybe two weeks.  And of course, there is not the fairy tale ending for our young lovers that has come to be standard in the genre.<br /><br />However, I think it is important not to forget why YA literature exists, and why it is so important.  YA lit faces themes that mature, difficult, and complicated on purpose.  While reading can be an escape, there are no stories without conflict! Without trial or strife! This helps prepare readers for the time when they will need to draw on the strength of the characters they loved, and can provide comfort to young people dealing with themes that they shouldn't have to deal with. Allegiant, in creating the Genetically Pure and Genetically Damaged labels, essentially is dealing with all -isms together.  Racism, sexism, classism, etc.  Tris, labeled pure, never for a second believes in this dogma, while otherwise goodhearted characters are happy to accept this explanation of their world.  This message matters enough to look past less than perfect writing and an ending  that makes us sad.  Loss is also a part of life, and as Four decides in the powerful scene with Christina, the way we are shaped by the people that love us make love worth it, even if it comes to an end.<br /><br />So maybe, when a child who reads faces an -ism, in the back of their mind will be the idea that genetic superiority is hogwash, that it it our actions and choices that define us, and just maybe they will be brave enough to stand up and say so.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|What an Awesome game, it has great graphics! I play this game in any free time I get- lots of fun, so glad it's free too!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed this book mostly because of the three separate stories and how they intertwined. One, a wife finds a letter from her husband, not to be opened until his death, another is a woman whose husband and cousin announce they're in love, and finally a grieving mother believes she has found her daughter's murderer, twenty years after the fact.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I could preach about this book in a good way but I'll save that. Simply to say this book made me laugh yet cry. I understood as a parent of a craniofacial child the good and the bad in this. Yet despite it all, it brought me hope in this dark world that just perhaps there are kind people left and despite my child's medical issues, she will survive and thrive. She has already taught many in her short life and I pray that as she gets older, she will not only continue that but to teach others how to choose kind as well just like she has done for not just other craniofacial kids but many more along with their families. God Bless!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I liked the story, but this was not a book that could easily be read on and off. With so many characters to remember, and several story lines to keep straight, and an intertwined story to sort out, it was not easy to pick up easily where I left off a couple days before . . I sometimes had to go back and reread to refresh and catch back up.
B00AMYTA7S|5.0|I had listened through this album a few weeks before I bought it and I loved it so much that I had to find it somewhere for purchase rather than waiting until it was released in the US. I had to pay a little bit more than I would've once it's released here, but it was well worth it.<br /><br />Honestly, I can't think of one thing that I dislike about it. Gabrielle's popular songs Home, Panic Cord, and Please Don't Say You Love Me are on here, as well as some other gems. My favorites are her cover of The Power of Love (hauntingly, beautiful), Human, and How Do You Feel Today. There's also a hidden track on the last song, so you're really getting 13 songs. Her voice is so ethereal and at times haunting, I love it! She's a beautiful musician. I would definitely suggest buying this album.
B009EAALEW|5.0|What a great tribute to the musicians and the music Chris covers here. Covered just like the originals only &#34;cleaner&#34; if you know what I mean. He brought the same songs done in the 50's and 60's, done exactly the same way, into a full fidelity 2013 recording. Not cleaned up and un click and popped, but full frequency and dynamic range! His efforts to get it right certainly paid off. Both the vocals and instrumental portions are spot on. Always been a Chris fan but this blows me away. What range!
1250038820|3.0|I'll begin by saying that I quite enjoy the blog itself; it is an idea that which on paper sounds merely okay but in actuality turned out to be a very refreshing and uplifting testament to the stories of humanity. It is a documentation of usual New York residents and their unusual pieces of personality and personal history. Brandon Stanton is competent as a photographer, but his technical skill isn't particularly noteworthy, he merely documents what he sees. It is his 15-second interviews that really rise above and breathe life into his several years of accumulated work. It is absolutely in these mini-interviews that accompanied every photo that his strength lies, and it really does make the HONY project exceptional. All this to say that I was excited about the publication, but when it arrived I felt almost cheated. The book itself is smaller in size than I expected for a photo-book (I believe about 8-9 inches) and for the most part, the interviews and quotes from the subjects have been replaced by short little quips by the author (some of which were clever than others) or simply a notation of where the photo was taken. Gone was the inspiration, gone was the warmth and absolute humanness of each photo, and what you are left with is simply a photo-book whose photos are often nothing to write home about. I still love the blog, and I've flipped through the entire book, but it probably won't be one that I will open again and again.

B005BY3XHC|5.0|THE SEVEN SPIRITUAL LAWS OF SUCCESS by Deepak Chopra<br />I have read almost all of Deepak Chopra’s books and this one … this one changed my way of thinking drastically. His philosophy guides the reader through SEVEN practical tenets for achieving goals and being satisfied with life. The first law: the Law of Pure Potentiality is met through silence, meditation, and non-judgment. This is the law I have put into practice daily. There is so much NOISE in the world that sometimes we fail to just be with our own thoughts. I found simply driving to or from work in SILENCE gave me the time to just BE. What happens when you experience silence? You start to notice sounds in nature, beauty, relationships, and fragrances – in essence the world around us. Along with the Law of Pure Potentiality, the remaining principles: the Law of Giving, the Law of Karma, the Law of Least Effort, the Law of Intention and Desire, the Law of Detachment, and the Law of Dharma or Purpose in Life are described in SEVEN short chapters. At the end of each chapter is a two-page guide on how to apply that principle. This book is 111 pages, but I believe is not meant to be read in one sitting. Instead, I read one chapter at a time, and then practiced using the application guide for several days. This book is about growing spiritually and creatively. I’m a pretty successful person – I’m happily married, have two great GROWN CHILDREN (YES!!), a career I love, and a wealth of friends. But I have a desire to do more, and this book simply helped me wake my creative side AND ACTUALLY DO MORE. I started this blog and I’m writing a book – need I say more?

B00EXVZZE8|4.0|Not bad if you just need to kill a few minutes. Could use less microtransactions. Would recommend turning the volume off.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|The last time I was motivated enough to write a review on a cd it was ABIII.<br /><br />Fortress is amazing - I have listened to it so much in the few weeks that its been out that I feel like I have had it for a year and...honestly, it just keeps getting better.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to see AB in Orlando on 10/4 and they played a few songs from Fortress and it was a moment I will never forget. I have been to shows where the artist says 'Hey this is from our new album' and no one cares - they just want to hear the old stuff they love - It was the total opposite with Alter Bridge - They opened with Addicted to Pain and set the mood. Incredible. I can die happy having now seen them live.<br /><br />If you aren't already an Alter Bridge fan, just dig in. You will not be disappointed if this kind of music is already to your liking.

0385350864|3.0|I'm so confused. Wasn't there a whole additional installment of Bridget in a British paper in which she (also disappointingly) had a baby with Daniel Cleaver and moved with him to LA? Did none of that \\"really\\" happen? Okay, Bridget is not real ... but I believed!

B00E9ZFIMM|2.0|No extras, just type a note and that's it. It doesn't even sync between devices.  They say more is coming, but it seems like they could have given us a bit more at the beginning to keep us from uninstalling. I may keep it on my phone for a short time to see if they come up with anything, but like someone else said, it doesn't come out right on the Asus transformer.

B008DM4OTA|5.0|My 3 year old loves this game. It keeps him engaged and makes him laugh. Even my 8 and 10 year olds like to watch him play.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|First let me say I truly loved book one of this series. It really is fantastic. Unfortunately that's where my liking took a sharp nosedive. Book two felt like a space keeper between an excellent book one and a hopefully fantastic book three. I could not have been more wrong. I am totally disappointed how this book and series turned out as a whole. The entire third book is a convoluted mess. I am unsure of why the author felt the need so add so many unnecessary and hard to follow elements in a final book. The book felt very confusing and unnecessary.<br />On a personal note I have to say that I do not condone happy endings where they are not appropriate. I was happy with how the Hunger Games ended. But Allegiant does nothing to either justify or rectify the horrible outcome for the main characters. I do not feel that the ending was justified, particularly because the entire story line was contrived. If you are going to kill off main characters, at least have the decency to make their deaths matter. The instance in this book provides no reward, sense of justice, or healing for others involved. I am not saying that everything had to get better, not by a long shot. This instance left the affected characters in a purgatory that they do not heal from. It would have been more effective to provide proof of such.<br />I am sad at the ending to this series. It didn't turn out even remotely the way I thought it would. I'm not looking for a &#34;happily ever after&#34;, or even a martyr's death for the good of society. I am looking for a well explained situation, regardless of the outcome. This book completely missed that mark.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Once again, Stephen King does not disappoint.  The characters are personable and I got involved immediately and CARED what happened to them aall.  Suitably creepy that I was scared to read on from time to time.  Great Book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun,  challenging, energizing and it help to build relationships with family and friends, as we interact to beat the chocolate.
B009AMANBA|2.0|I did not like this movie.  It was one of the worst movies .I have ever seen on Abraham Lincoln.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|In addition to being an excellent adaptation of the Marvel Comics Strip adventures, this feature winds a fabulous yarn that leads to the creation of the TV series currently airing on ABC as Agents of SHIELD. The cast of the feature film does not overlap TV series beyond one part literally 'resurrected' from the film, however, the same fascination with Super Heroes aka normal humans who discover/develop super-skills is key to the drama.<br />As always, Robert Downey, Jr., receives top billing and is prominent in the portrayal of Iron Man... Samuel Jackson does the role of Nick Fury justice but, the characters doe not reappear in the TV series; nor does Hawkeye, Hulk, Black Widow, Thor, or Captain America. It is the relatively minor part of Agent Phil Coulson, acted by Clark Gregg, that returns to small screen as team leader and organizer of the Agents of SHIELD.<br />All in all, the film stands by itself as a decent adaptation... with thrills, special effects and drama enough to pull off a major coup for Marvel Comics... and lead to the television series.
B00FPH6M82|4.0|This movie really seems like it would be like all the rest....I was glad we rented the movie. It had a lot of twist to the plot.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|The game would be great if you didn't have to depend on others to move on. I played got to level 18 and ran out of lives haven't played again!!!
B004DHUAZQ|4.0|This is really a stand alone. Some people and the story line is kind of the some. Lots of shooting one liners left and right. However no need to see the first one in order to know what's going on in the movie.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love this book! It is very well written and the characters are great. It is not as hardcore as fifty shades but I actually prefer this one over fifty shades of grey.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I gave this to my nephew who is 8 as a gift.  It was exactly what was expected and he enjoyed it.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Wow. Nothing more. This was amazing. Ms. Roth couldn't have written a better ending to her trilogy.  I can't wait to see what's next.
B002PLALCO|5.0|LOVE PINK LOVE the SONG love the lyrics. AWESOME IN CONCERT!!! Cannot say much more other than she is incredible and this song SPEAKS to me and my husband... as a same sex married couple, the testosterone runs high.... it's a deep love with hate thrown in as we have our dependency days and independent want to be left alone days... this song says it all

B00E1LQ7Q0|5.0|Well the FIRST 20/20 to me was BEST... this should have been named something different!  Although we love JT and have seen him in concert many times, this one did not cut it for me... if he wanted to release &#34;the rest&#34; of 20/20 it should have held up to the first one... this should have simply been named something different.  I think it was a hype to sell it!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved the entire Downton Abbey series.  Getting to know the characters over the long term, through many challenges, letting us see their heart, their hurt, their vulnerabilities, their prejudices.  It's all very real.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|We have tickets to see her in concert AGAIN!!  SHE IS A LEGEND and she always comes around even at age 67!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Here is the perfect recipe to ruin a trilogy, an upcoming movie and possibly you entire carrer:<br /><br />1. Write Divegent: make your readers fall in love with your characters, add mistery to the romance, make a skinny girl tough and strong.<br />2. Write Insurgent: Make the girl a little depressed and edgy, make her reckless and unstable, add some fights to the romance. Make your readers want to slap the protagonist in the face for so many bad choices. Fix it all at the end thanks to the guy and its never-ending forgiveness.<br />3. Write Allegiant: Lose the interest in your own story, stop caring if you are developing a good book, just worry about senseless \\"impact\\" no matter what, lose you mind and be willing to lose your readers. Then close your eyes and type meaningless sentences without stopping to see what you've done.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD!!<br />Veronica Roth impressed me at first. Such a young author! she created the first two books that are far from being perfect but I got to care and felt fond to the characters. I love the misterious Tobias, never knowing what he really thought and always seeing him be the strongest, most reliable one. After Insurgent I thought we were done with the bad decisions and that the non-developing relationship of Tris and Tobias would finally go somewhere. After their last lines in Insurgent, when the trust was back, I thought that we were now going to see serious development in characters and in the romance... Alligent was extremely desappointing at this and every other single level, and did not bring the so-needed closure and sense to this repetitive story (how many times have they go through revolution and secret agendas?).<br /><br />So many things went wrong! 1)The two POV's were absolutely confusing, there was not difference between Tris' and Tobias' language or way of thinking. I got lost so many times in which one was narrating. Instead of either preserving the Mistery about Tobias or actually discovering a brilliant mind, we only saw Tobias as an extension of Tris's mind. 2)Divergence, actually ment nothing! for two books we got to believe that being Divergent ment that you were special, and that you had some power or skill that made you unique. Now it just means nothing,it didn't even made a difference when Tobias was no longer in that category. 3)Peter was unnecessarily pushed into the book for nor reason. his character never brought anything to the story, just dead weight. 4) Tobias turns into a 12 year old, yelling at everyone and making all the bad decision as possible. At least in Insurgent he had a good motive. But in Alligent he is driven only by his pride and desperation. Not the Four we all know and love.<br /><br />But by far, the worst thing of all is the senseless, unnecessary and very predictable dead of Tris. By the time I realized that this book had 2 POV's it was obvious that Tris would not survive. Ms. Roth, how could you kill your main character when half of your book was and is still in need of conclusion? Tris got to die only to add shock value to the book but it was done in a bad way. It made the full trilogy meaningless and absurd. Real impact would have been that Caleb was the actual unselfish one and at the end decided to do the right thing (Remember Prim Everdeen??). Tris should have survived so all the loses and gains were worth it. Let her live through it and make a real statement of reallity and mending each other, so we had the chance to actually see the story conclude with an actual character and romance development. (Just as Moking Jay did at the very end). And after Tris got killed in the most unoriginal  way (gunshots?? Really?? after surviving death serum?) we are left to see Tobias struggle and suffer and never recovering from his lost. This was heartbreaking and painfull. We don't want to see our beloved characters suffer for no reason and with no sight of hope.<br /><br />And as if this was not enough, Tobias, our brave, strong, misterious, reliable Four, became a politician??!! You have to be kidding me!! the thing he and Tris hated the most? the same as Marcus? this was absolutely ridiculous!<br /><br />Ms. Roth, you tried to make the story real, but instead you made so many unrealistic turns (unrealistic to the characters)and so many absurd outcomes that I have lost my entire faith in this trilogy and in any future book written by you for that matter. We already have enough tragedy in the real world, no need to bring that to our faces in a book. And certanly not in this way! You could have done a great final book, a remarcable one. One that we would never forget, but instead decided to go exactly the other way and now me and other readers will spend our energy in trying to forget this tragic, horrible and insensate ending. I wish I had some memory serum.<br /><br />I just hope I can have a refund. I will buy a notebook and a pencil and write my own ending. At least that will keep me from hating the entire series for ever.
B00ERIUO1G|5.0|Love her, would NOT expect this from her..a new side!  Although her one hit is overplayed on the \\"radio\\" it still is amazing! AS SHE IS AMAZING!!!

1619695006|1.0|I found it hard to understand that the author who could create such believable characters and suspense as existed in the Harry Potter books could offer such boring, dull and unsuspenseful characters and story line as existed in this book. It was predictable and trite. Maybe listening to it was part of the problem. Perhaps I could have raced along if reading and skipped some of the overly descriptive passages. I certainly would not have had to listen to the British accent. While I found none of the characters likable or sympathetic I continued listening because I kept hoping it would get better. It did not.

B00B7Y0206|5.0|This app is so freaking awesome . I use it all the time you can also find channels too it almost never buffers.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I really like this game for myself I download it on kindle fire hd and i love it the graphics are amazing and there is goals that im currently looking for on this game so it's fun for adults and kids alike as well.. I would recommend it to everyone I've been disney fan since I was a kid and really still am a Disney fan too :-) :-)
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Yes, it is a sad book, but remember one thing: it's a dystopian novel! Hunger Games had a very bittersweet ending too, just saying. I thought the story was very beautiful: ultimate love, ultimate sacrifice, ultimate bravery. Think of it as a Joan of Arc story. This is a book I will never forget...you never do forget the sad ones.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has done it again.  He has a provocative premise, lots of examples to support the premise, a sprinkling of research to give credibility to the whole thing.  It is a great read, with much to stimulate thought, lots of topics for conversation, but will probably never be printed in the journal of science.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|The first one was by far the best, this one still had it's funny moments, but just not HYSTERICAL like the first.  Gotta love these guys though!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Frustrating but love it! Just when you think you got it, BAM, there is one jelly left and no moves.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The actual game is amazing. Ads do appear and many things you have to buy with real money but mostly it is pretty good.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This book came highly recommended to me by a woman who has climbed the ladder in the world of collegiate athletics administration. I would recommend this book to anyone willing to learn more about positioning themselves for success.<br /><br />As a college coach, there are many points that hit home.  One that stuck out was that you do not have to choose between a family and a career.  You can have both. And if you do decide to choose one over the other, both deserve the same respect.<br /><br />Many women have paved the way before me and I hope to leave this world a better place for those behind me.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Like the game  colorful and cute. Would recommend.<br />Only hate to wait for more lives.<br />  Got game free so cannot complain
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is a good game to keep your mind and brain active. very relaxing &amp; good old fashion fun. An addiction that won't hurt
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Bought the movie when it first came out but someone in the family loaned it to someone and it was never returned, so I was happy to be able to buy it again.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|SPOILERS!!<br />I have several problems with the end of this book, and not only that. Killing Tris made a joke of all the fans that were hoping, praying and expecting a romantic ending, which is what is to be expected logically, since the spark that kept the series flaring was Tris and Tobias. And what do you tell me about the time (in Divergent) that Tobias said he wouldn't let anyone kill her (''They're gonna kill me'' ''I'm not gonna let that happen''). Tris a ''brave'' heroine died without a single fight, and no heroic last words. She died to erase everyone's memories and by shotgun wounds, which if you ask me, isn't at all that heroic or outstanding. Tobias' last conversation with her was quite romantic, it included a good bye which could've helped out foreshadow Tris' heartbreaking end, but it just doesn't fit the puzzle. Tobias didn't even throw a fit when he found out, standing still — shocked — might be a ''normal'' reaction, but seriously, I would be crying, I wouldn't believe it. He LOVED Tris for God's sake. The first two books are a waste now. All those small moments Tris had, it's just a waste. Especially since this book talked about to her training time in Dauntless so much and those small happy moments with her friends and Tobias. It all seems like a very, very bad joke. I expected much more from Veronica. KILL THE WORLD, FOR ALL I CARE, BUT TRIS AND TOBIAS WERE MEANT TO STAY. I can't help but let my mind wander about what happens now with Tobias. He just lives with his mom, with the burden that his love is now dead. Then what, he falls for someone else? Would Tris really like that? They were young and in love, but it felt like they were meant to last forever, it would feel like a betrayal for him to fall for another woman. I'm just getting ahead, I know there won't be any more books. I was planning to reread the series, but now that Allegiant killed my love for the series, I'm not sure I can even think about the happy and amazing moments of thefirst two books and even some of the third, without thinking, woops it's a joke, all a waste, Tris is dead. Like some of the other reviews said, the voice of Tobias and Tris is far to similar, making it quite confusing. Some of the events and details didn't add up, and I have to admit, I am left with questions. I would've liked an epilogue like the Mocking Jay one. Sure, it doesn't end perfectly, but the main characters are happy, they're together. What Veronica built throughout the series was wasted and thrown away and spit on. On the other hand, what Suzanne Collins wrote and praised between Peeta and Katniss remained. It was satisfying. And that's a mistake Veronica made. She didn't think of how attatched readers could become and stabbed us with a knife, over and over. I can't even say how much she ruined the series for me. What about the time Tobis shot knifes at her, or put his hand on her stomach in training, or went through his fear landscape with Tris — which should've been mentioned when he ziplined.<br /><br />Veronica, you ruined your work of art, and we, Divergent and Insurgent fans/ Tris and Tobias fans are extremely disappointed.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|It wont download on my kindle at all. I don't know how many times I tried to download it.  whatever it sucks.

B003G8Y4QO|5.0|A wonderful introduction into Matt Smiths Doctor, Clever pacing as well as some genuinely heart wrenching moments. The reckless, silly and a tad arrogant Eleventh Doctor at his best.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Lots of fun and a good mental workout.  Levels range from 10 year old easy to pretty difficult.  Wish it got even harder.  If you route circuits for a living you need this app.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I put off watching this latest Dredd comic book adaptation for a long time.  I must admit that I kind of liked it.  It was certainly better than the Sly Stallone dreck that preceded it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's great, really, but everything's soooo expensive. Even so, it's pretty cool. Btw, I pretty much just rated this for the bananas. It's still awesome, though. Have fun with it!
0425261360|2.0|Pat seems to have lost it.. I find this book very disjointed and confusing. Too much information that is not pertinent to the story line.<br />A very hard read
B001ANYDAO|4.0|This is a great book to read. The stories are very well detailed and easy to follow. The main message is that some are more successful because of their situation. I'm trying to find what this means to me though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Every one I know, it seems, is playing this game but I was determined to avoid it. But, in a moment of weakness I downloaded it and I've been enjoying it ever since.
B00BIPCY14|5.0|Great show! Good entertainment.... always keeps you guessing. I would personally recommend it to anyone with interest in law. Enjoy!
B00DXP0QV2|4.0|Infinitely superior to the 'Nevermind' re-release in terms of sound quality, but doesn't offer quite as much new material, probably because most of the good unreleased 'In Utero'-era material was released on 'With the Lights Out' in 2004. The 2013 mix tracks are a cool feature (although I was hesitant about them at first), they offer a new look at the album with emphasis on things you might not have noticed before (except the B-sides should have been released with their original mixes). And of course Live 'n' Loud is just a worthy and overdue addition. But the highlight for me has got to be the rough demo tracks
B00EMGUR60|5.0|Kick ass Mot&ouml;rhead ,these guys just don't quit .I have quite a collection of their work and this ranks with the best!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this game. I've always loved the Bloons TD games. When I found out that Bloons TD 5 an app, I was pretty happy. If you've never played it before, you can try it on Ninja Kiwi. It's great. Try it.
B00DU77QP2|2.0|While the premise of this book held potential, for me it was tarnished significantly by the poor execution in construction of the story itself.  I felt there was promise in the concept of shadowhunters, and their war against the dark underworld to which most of humanity is ignorant, and I was very excited to see where Clare would take it.  Unfortunately that's where the excitement ended.<br /><br />From the first chapter the story was packed with more clichés than I thought existed.  Our protagonist Clary is your `typical' sixteen-year-old; chronically self-absorbed, overly concerned with her image, and engaged in a perpetual war-of-wills with her mother.  Despite that she thinks herself unattractive, others all seem to find her beautiful.  To round it off, she is completely oblivious to the attentions of her long-time best friend Simon, who happens to be a sweet and caring guy, and is very much in love with her.<br /><br />Instead, she finds herself draws to the mysterious, arrogant badass whom she witnesses committing murder in a club.  As it turns out said badass is a shadowhunter named Jace, and the murder victim was an evil demon.  From here, Clary is rapidly tumbled into a world of the supernatural when her mother goes missing and Clary learns that she was in fact a shadowhunter in hiding.  Much action follows, with Clary (predictably) falling for the obnoxious Jace in favour of Simon, within roughly a week of their acquaintance.  In addition to the melodrama of her romantic life, Clary discovers that her mother was taken by a big evil shadowhunter named Valentine, who is in search of a powerful shadowhunter artefact, the Mortal Cup, and she along with her shadow hunter buddies, must stop him.<br /><br />WARNING: Plot spoilers<br /><br />From here the story rapidly descends into the realm of \\"Greek Tragedy,\\" when it turns out that Valentine is in fact her father, rendered corrupt by the power of the Cup after using it to perform experiments on his pregnant wife and unborn child.  Eventually Clary's mother managed to figure this out, and took off with the cup, hiding it and her daughter where she thought they couldn't be found.  As if one \\"I am your father\\" moment is not enough, it is later revealed to Jace that Valentine is also his father, which means of course that the two prospective lovers now believe themselves brother and sister.<br /><br />By this point I simply sat frowning at the book, wondering how on earth I was expected to remain interested when all I'd received at this (rather late) stage was predictability, melodrama and repeated clichés in both plot and characters.  Jace in particular was painful, and even as a sixteen year old reading this I found him utterly unattractive.  The supporting characters were not much better; largely stereotypes with very little depth.  I continued through the second book in the hopes that it would improve, but I was once again disappointed and gave up not long after.  Perhaps it was simply a mistake to read this directly after Jacqueline Carey's stunning Kushiel's Legacy series, with its intricate plot, characters, world building and themes, or perhaps I was just never really going to like this book no matter what.  Regardless, despite that I thought the concepts were cool, I just couldn't handle the characters or the story.  If you can ignore these things, I would recommend it as a light read, most suitable for younger teens.
B008LD09LS|5.0|Great distraction... and it is free. Works great... need more practice,,, But for sure, I will master it , very soon.

159420229X|5.0|As if see it moonwalking is written to open our eyes to the world of mnemonics. Personally ive just started with a book called Unleash Your Hidden Poker Memory and really needed something like this comprehensive work as a foundation. If you don't know where your going you might not get there. If you want to remember things this book points you in that direction with a clarity of your Journey.<br /><br />Also I must say it is fun to read and it gave me a great respect for Joshua Foer as a humble, objective journalist. It was hard to know if he thought Tony Buzan was a charlaton or guru (it seems a bit of both). In the end I think it was pretty much just reporting what he knew or felt about Buzan and really left up to the reader to form his own opinion, a novel approach for  a reporter these days it seems to me.<br /><br />My biggest hope is that he will write a moonwalking book for techniques to learn a Language. If he doesn't I think his present book might put me on the road to developing my own system, right after i learn mnemonics for poker of course.<br /><br />Hats off to Joshua. William from vancouver
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love the dwarf's sense of humour. Each character is well displayed, the plot etc. Too bad, we lost Ned Starck

B00CHVJODE|5.0|Good messages.  Beautifully animated.  The pace of the film keeps one's attention....It has a nice balance of humor and messages about family relationships.  The use of color of the varied landscapes is spectacular, and the imagination used in creating creatures, such as the whale that walks on land,  makes the film a lot of fun to watch.
B008JFUO72|5.0|I enjoyed this Iron Man 3 just as much as I have enjoyed the first two.  Robert Downey Jr. does a great job and he is very funny, too.  I recommend it to all Robert Downey Jr. and super hero movie lovers.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It takes courage for an author to write an ending that stays true to their own vision, not what others want. If every story written gave the reader exactly what they wanted, the libraries would be filled with books filled with boring stories.<br /><br />Veronica Roth has written a strong story arc that gives us characters filled with conviction, strength, and humanity. Her underlying theme of free-will was carried through the series without fear. Frankly, (I will keep this spoiler free) the conclusion of this trilogy did not make me angry or cause me to scorn the author.<br /><br />I enjoyed this series, I found the it thought provoking. I can't wait to see what Veronica Roth comes up with in the future.

I hope whatever update is necessary for it to work with the new technology will be accomplished soon.<br /><br />Update 11/5/2013:  The app showed in my cloud today, so I installed it.  Seems to be working fine on my HDX.  Thanks for the update!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|...version. You can play for points or against time. No purchasing requirements. Lots of interesting levels. Quickly became my favorite version.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I couldn't put this down, but I found it terribly depressing. Flynn is a master at manipulating emotions. Tricking you into sympathy for a character and then slicing that character's nasty insides wide open to show you the festering rot and decay. I am in a very happy marriage and reading this book made me go to bed thinking anxious ridiculous thoughts. So three stars because the bleak view of humanity was so relentless and cruel.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Okay maybe Pacific Rim does not boast the most complicated story line, or expend large amounts of time on character development; but it does spend lots and lots of time being awesome! The special effects and action of this movie are second to none. There is something about the sheer scale of the Jaegers and of the Kaiju that is awe-inspiring. I mean, we are talking about machines and beasts that could tromp on the likes of the Transformers; do not take that comment lightly as I hold the Transformers in the highest regard. All said it will make any person that ever wanted to be a Gundam Warrior feel like a giddy little kid again.
B0064MGU98|5.0|In just the last few weeks, I've started watching the current season of The Good Wife. I can't believe I didn't watch this amazing how when it first started. So now I'm playing catch up and I was hooked from the first episode. Acting is first rate as are the storylines.
B00AJLHUA8|3.0|A crime novelist, Ellison Oswald (Ethan Hawke) moves into a house where several members of a family were brutally murdered and the youngest daughter disappeared. Ellison, trying to revive his now dead writing career, intends to write a book about the murders and has moved into the house for inspiration. His clueless wife, Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and his 2 children, are unaware of their new homes murderous past. Ellison soon discovers a bunch of home movies in his attic, and when he views them, finds out they are all snuff films, spanning several decades. He enlists the help of a local deputy, and a professor who specializes in the occult, to try to make sense of the grisly crimes and to establish the connections between the murders despite years, decades, separating each crimes.<br /><br />This creepy horror tale is at times shocking and disturbing despite having minimal gore on display. It's all in the atmosphere and the gruesome subject matter. Watching people being murdered in horrific ways via a grainy home movie is chilling and the super 8 movies are very well done. The locations are dark, with minimal lighting, no sounds, sometimes grainy and always spooky. Some of the home movies start out charmingly enough, with the luck-less victims having a great time either fishing, at a picnic, hanging around in the swimming pool etc then the footage cuts to some horrible executions. The tale then takes a supernatural twist when Ellison discovers a creepy looking face watching from the depths of a swimming pool in one of the film clips and also notices a strange occult symbol that keeps re-appearing and is discovered to represent a malevolent and mysterious pagan deity.<br /><br />The film is very atmospheric, and many of the shots are in complete darkness and the main character is always walking around looking fearful and paranoid, which adds to the films tone. However, I do wish he would have just turned on some lights and saved us all the grief. Dude, you are investigating a strange noise and carrying a baseball bat for protection, walking through various dark rooms of your creepy house, would it hurt you to turn on a few light switches? Geesh. Despite a very creepy atmosphere, the film does not always get it right and there are one too many jump scares too many. There is one scene that takes it to an absurd level and inspired some laughter from the audience when I watched this at the theatre. I imagine laughter was not what the director was going for and this just proves that you can over-do it. The film is a bit predictable and how many supernatural themed horror films have you seen that involve a child who can sense the evil and draws pictures of the evil yet the parents remain clueless? The pace is also a bit slow. This movie is more psychological so this is expected, but having one actor carry the whole picture may not have been a good idea. Hawke is good, but we get far too many shots of him being shocked, or worried, or bored, or scared, and although I liked the idea of keeping the villain a mystery and not giving it a whole lot of screen time, I would have preferred more of it, and less of the annoying children that kept re-appearing throughout the film.<br /><br />Despite the negatives, \\"Sinister\\" is a pretty good chiller with good performances, and a lot of tension and atmosphere and although there are a lot of murders being committed, most of it is not shown, just implied or not clear enough to warrant looking away (even so, I have to admit, some of the home movies, as brief as they were, disturbed me to the core). As is typical of today's horror movies, there is a twist ending and the film ends on a high yet disturbing note. With some minor tweaks, \\"Sinister\\" could have been a whole lot better but it is still a good horror film to watch with the lights off and on Halloween night.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5ting a strange noise and carrying a baseball bat for protection, walking through various dark rooms of your creepy house, would it hurt you to turn on a few light switches?

1609611543|5.0|I found over the years that I have arthritic pain in my joints due to wheat.  Once off wheat for around a week the pain is gone.  I start eating wheat again and the arthritis comes back after 2 or 3 days.  If you read the book and follow the wheat free eating you WILL solve a lot of health problems, but be ready, they put wheat in everything...even tomato soup!
030758836X|3.0|This book reads easily from two different standpoints, and then around midway, switches the perspective.  I couldn't put it down, but I just wanted to be done with it.  It wasn't as gripping as I had hoped it would be.  At first seemingly predictable, then it wasn't what you thought and became predictable in another sort of way.  Really didn't take off until about the 2/3rd mark and then I was anxious for the just desserts to happen.  And then, it didn't.  And I was really ANGRY at the end.  I was left wanting more of a wrap up, more satisfying.  I have rarely felt as unsatisfied and irritated as I was with the ending of this book.  Sure evoked emotion, so the author succeeded in that respect.  Still really, really irritated.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I enjoy this game a lot! One of my favorites! Only complaint is how long its gonna take to get great white cause that's all I want!
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|Overall, I liked this game. I just don't think it should be on kindle. I was playing the game that you have to blow into the device to keep the airplane in the air and that does NOT work. This is because kindles do not come with a microphone therefore, resulting in a death. Boom. Only 2 lives remaining. This problem could end your game, ruining your high score that you were so close to beating.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|One of the best shows on TV. Great turn of events. Great dialogs between characters. This show is a must ti watch!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app.  Lots of options (version, font, font size, color etc.) and so convenient-read anywhere, and sync reading plans to multiple devices.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked it. However I found the two main characters unlikeable. Liked the surprise ending. Something Woody Allen could admire.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|started playing about 6 months ago...now I make sure I am on here at least once a day! if I had to give a downside, I would suggest allowing us to accept more than 5 credits every 12 hrs from friends.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Recommended to my book club by another book club.  Very touching.  I don't want to write a longer review - since it is a book better read just on recommendation
B0058VW36U|4.0|I really enjoy this game. It makes me think as well and strategized. which can be a little frustrating at times when things don't go my way.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I hounded you to get this app never thought it would be this soon thank you.  This is great entertainment.nO
B000059H98|3.0|I bought this for my sis. She loves this movie. I think its ok. The story is bizarre and about a chick looking for water and ends up with kangaroo people. The main chick is funny, but this is not a movie for anyone.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have been playing this on my 7 inch kindle fire, and I have not found anything wrong with it yet. Also it is very fun to play.
B00B5SJEOO|5.0|While the film may be a classic, like so many fantasy and action films not all of it stands the test of time. One thing that will always stand strong is the soundtrack. It's not only epic, but it's operatic. The score is sweeping but not in the bombastic way that more modern soundtracks are in their attempts to encompass a grand scale. The soundtrack itself tells a fantastic story since the score runs through nearly the entire film and not just for select scenes. A monumental musica achievement.
B00881VLCE|1.0|It doesn't work on my phone...Samsung Galaxy S4...It worked fine on the Galaxy S3 but won't do anything on here and I loved the app
B00EPFEY44|5.0|Excellent music and setting. Much enjoyed both the CD and DVD. Some of Andrea Bocelli's best work with in one of the most romantic locations in the world.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|What a horrible ending! I agree with what everyone else has said. I waited so long for this. I felt like the author just didn't care about her fans and just wanted to end the series. She left me heartbroken and in tears. I hope she's happy with herself
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The book was slow and monotonous and I found the interaction between Tris and Four to be annoying. The end was terrible and I am so disappointed with this book. I had such high expectations after the first two that this was such a let down and ended up being a poor morality story.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This is the worst book I have read in a long time.  I loved both Divergent and Insurgent, however this ending has ruined the first 2 books for me.  Not even looking forward to the movie anymore:(
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. I am maxed out and waiting for levels on my phone. It is so much bigger and easier to play on my kindle. In would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes this type of game.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|That is the reason I wanted this. Doesn't do it. Google removed that capability for some stupid reason after saying we could do that.

B00ERIUO02|5.0|After the mostly light and up-tempo heavy album \\"Teenage Dream\\", Katy shows a deeper side with \\"Prism\\". There are still light and dance worthy songs but the majority of \\"Prism\\" are slower songs with deeper lyrics that show a little bit of the journey that Katy has been in the three years between \\"Teenage Dream\\" and \\"Prism\\" (which we all know has been quite a big journey).<br /><br />1. Roar - 5/5 Obviously most people are familiar with this song since it's the lead song from the album. A great \\"girl power\\" anthem and a great way to start the album off.<br /><br />2. Legendary Lovers - 4/5 A slower tempo song that has kind of a middle-Eastern flow to it. It's a good song but I think it gets a little overshadowed by some of the other songs on the album. It could have potential to be a showstopper in concert, though.<br /><br />3. Birthday - 5/5 An uptempo song. I could see this be a great summer song ala \\"Last Friday Night\\". Great song to sing and dance along to.<br /><br />4. Walking on Air - 5/5 Katy's tribute to the great dance songs of the 1990's. Growing up and being in my early teens in the mid to late 90's, I absolutely love this song. I downloaded this song when it became available before the album was released, I played it over and over. It has to be a single.<br /><br />5. Unconditionally - 5/5 A beautiful ballad. This songs has beautiful lyrics about loving someone unconditionally. I love the bridge when she sings \\"So open up your heart and just let it begin\\". Great potential to be a single.<br /><br />6. Dark Horse feat. Juicy J - 5/5  A different sound for Katy where it's definitely more R&B/urban sounding. It's got a great beat and another one of my favorite songs on the album. \\"So you want to play with magic...\\"<br /><br />7. This Is How We Do - 5/5 Kind of a song with lyrics along the same lines of \\"Last Friday Night\\" about partying but with a slower tempo. It's pretty catchy and fun to sing along to.<br /><br />8. International Smile - 5/5 A fun dance song which is dedicated to Katy's best friend Mia Moretti, who is a DJ.<br /><br />9. Ghost - 5/5 One of the more personal songs on the album. A slow song which is obviously about her divorce. The song starts out with the words \\"You sent a text\\", which Katy told Vogue magazine that she got the news of her divorce. The song is reminiscent \\"Wide Awake\\" in the emotional tones.<br /><br />10. Love me - 3/5 A mid-tempo song. I'm not really sure how I feel about this song yet. I think I'll have to listen to it more to get a definite feeling about it. It's not really one of the stronger tracks though.<br /><br />11. This Moment - 4/5 A mid-tempo song. Not one of my favorite tracks on the cd but I like it better than \\"Love Me\\". I like the chorus of the song.<br /><br />12. Double Rainbow - 5/5 A slower song. It's a pretty love song. I could see this being a song for a lot of couples.<br /><br />13. By the Grace of God - 5/5 Slow song. Definitely the most personal song on the album. It's all about what Katy went through in the dark period after her divorce. With lyrics like \\"Lying on the bathroom floor\\", \\"And I looked in the mirror and decided to stay\\", and \\"I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water\\", it's definitely a dark but still uplifting song. Anyone who has gone through hard times and depression will surely feel something when listening to the song.<br /><br />14. Spiritual - 4/5 I would call this a mid-tempo song. A love song which I think I'll probably like more as I listen to the album mo<br /><br />15. It Takes Two - 4/5 A mid-temp song about how there are two sides to every story and that in some cases, it takes two people to break up a relationship. It's a good song and it seems another song that is from Katy's real life experience<br /><br />16. Choose Your Battles - 5/5  A mid-tempo song about fighting in a relationship. This is my favorite song off of the album at the moment. It gave me goosebumps listening to it for the first time. I really likethe \\"If you wanna go, then go. If you wanna stay, then stay\\" part of the song. A perfect way to end the deluxe version of \\"Prism\\".<br /><br />I really love what Katy did on \\"Prism\\". I'm sure that there will some people disappointed that there aren't more upbeat, pure pop songs like \\"Hot N Cold\\" or \\"Peacock\\" or that she didn't stay in the candyland for \\"Teenage Dream Part 2\\". But I think most fans will appreciate and understand the change in direction. More people would probably have complained if she tried to replicate \\"Teenage Dream\\".<br /><br />\\"Prism\\" is definitely a must for Katy fans and for pop music fans.the \\"If you wanna go, then go.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book! :) can't wait to read the next in the series! Highly recommended! I couldn't put the book down at times and always looked forward to picking it back up :)
B0000029AP|5.0|To me, personally, THIS is Aerosmith. It embodies the band at their finest. Tyler's voice is so amazing, the songwriting is strong, and there's not a clunker on the record.<br />  I haven't listened to it in years, but I've just so enjoyed getting reunited. The newer Aerosmith stuff just leaves me cold. How can you top &#34;No More, No More&#34; or &#34;You See Me Crying&#34;?! Not with &#34;Janie's Got A Gun&#34;, I promise you THAT!
B003CHGV74|5.0|I'm losing a lot of sleep with this series.  I can't wait to see what happens next.  It lives up to all the hype.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Another great book in which Malcolm Gladwell questions whether or not we truly understand the concept of disadvantages. As per his previous books and essays he often compares seemingly unrelated examples to illustrate the the theme of the book that there really is 'desirable difficulty'.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I am a progressive rock fan mostly but heard &#34;Sail&#34; on my daughter's player and bought the CD based on that one song but was pleasantly surprised that I like most of their innovative songs.  I get bored easily by repetitive Pop music but this music got me interested and I'm hard to please.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I would not ordinarily want to read a book about zombies, but this one got so much press though I'd give it a try.  While it is certainly a sci-go book about a stupid  monster (  unlike vampires, which are sexy and interesting), it is really about so much more. It is about human resilience and weakness, political corruption and power vacuums, the inadequacy of communication between those in power and those following order and the terrible consequences that can cause, and so much more.  The story is well written and all the accounts kept me on the edge of my seat.  My only complaint was I WANTED more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have waited for this awesome addicted game.It's the real thing.My grand love it as well.I'm so happy,keep the great games coming.
B009GED3HS|5.0|We enjoy this show and have watched each episode and every season. The acting is great, and it is an interesting show the way it is written.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|It's an amazing true story of triumph for a person with a disability going against a society which at the time was unkind to people with autism, let alone anyone who was disabled or different.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Great show with fantastic character development! I would recommend the whole series. Delivery was pretty quick. I will be purchasing the next season as well.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Its a really good book that leaves wanting more with the exciting endings to each chapter and how peeta and katniss seem to really fall in love. I think that it is one of the best books I've read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is fun and becomes more challenging as you progress.  It test your reasoning skills as well as your patience.
B00170M2GW|3.0|Terrific acting by Gene Hackman, decent acting by Stone, Crowe and Henriksen and a surprisingly affecting turn by DiCaprio can't disguise the essentially daft plot or the rather unbelievable ending. Still, this is worth watching at least once because Hackman is mesmerising (as was Henriksen in his short appearance).
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I absolutely loved Divergent and Insurgent. Tris and Tobias were exceptionally developed characters and completely relatable. Their city, lives and the situations they lived are not easily understood by someone living in our day and age, but the detail that Veronica Roth have made everything understandable.<br /><br />Allegiant is no different. Tris and Tobias are still fighting for the right to live how they choose, but the enemy is different. They still grab my heart with the absolute purity of their love. This time around the enemy and allies are harder to define, but they find their way through together.<br /><br />Did this story end as I would have wished? No.<br />Was the writing, story and the characters still just as interesting and engaging? Absolutely.<br /><br />The story comes from the author and their creative process. We can all disagree on whether we liked it or not, but that does not take away from the emotions the words create.  I cried hard when I finished this book and I haven't cried at the end of a book since Harry Potter. I'm sad it's over even though I wish it ended differently. I'll miss these characters and the world they lived in and are trying to build again. My kudos and thanks to Ms. Roth on an exceptional trilogy!
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I PRE ORDERED IT WITHOUT EVEN SEEING IT FIRST. I JUST KNEW I WOULD LOVE IT WITH THE PREVIEWS AND MY LOVE FOR LORRAINE WARREN. THIS MOVIE IS CREEPY AND EVERYTHING I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It's a nice follow up after the shining, even though they don't talk about the Overlook much it still talks about Danny and the Shining
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If you want a game to keep coming back to this is it. Starts out slow and easy and then before you know it your upset that your stuck on a level, but you keep coming back to beat it.<br /><br />This is a GREAT game to download. You Want it! You need it! Just download it!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm a Stephen King fan and love all his books. He's a genius and the best writer of all times. Great book.
B008JFUR10|1.0|Whomever packaged this EXCELLENT movie made a HORRIBLE mistake!!!  Instead of including the standard Digital Download (which typically gets downloaded from iTunes or a similar entity), they have chosen ULTRAVIOLET.  When I bought this movie, I was not informed what exactly UltraViolet was.  Here's what you need to know:<br /><br />1. This is a really good movie!  Buy it, just don't buy it via UltraViolet.<br />2. You are REQUIRED to set up TWO ACCOUNTS in order to even download this movie from UltraViolet.  (A Flixster account & an UltraViolet account)<br />3. You are then REQUIRED to download an application to your computer called FLIXSTER DESKTOP.  I try to keep my computer pretty lean as far as what I download, so this was discouraging to me.<br />4. You have NO ACCESS whatsoever to the movie file that has just taken a very long time to download onto FLIXSTER DESKTOP.  There's no way to copy it to your phone or to iTunes, or anything else.<br />5. In order to watch it on your iPhone, you must download the FLIXSTER APP.  Then, you have to sign in, which brings up your movie.  Then & only then can you watch the movie that you've paid for.<br /><br />Ultraviolet claims that you can get your movie, when you want it, how you want it, but this is MISLEADING.  We should all have a right to own our movies digitally in a format that we want, especially when we pay extra to have this digital copy.<br /><br />Once again:<br /><br />Excellent movie 5 out of 5 stars<br />Horrible digital download 0 out of 5 stars
B00BD99JMW|2.0|SPOLIER ALERT!!!<br /><br />I posted this review on another forum in response to the never ending comments about the ending:<br /><br />1. There were too many \\"climaxes\\", and unfortunately none of them happened on a couch in a hotel with hundreds of private rooms. Buh Dum Bum!<br />2. The serums: it makes sense on a \\"futuristic/dystopian\\" level to have some kind of biological technology that would be able to alter people's minds/DNA. The flaw in this installment was that VR didn't fully develop the divergent DNA as evolutionary or just resilient to these particular strains. For example: we know that over time we all develop immunity to some antibiotics. If the Chi town people were around 7-8 generations down of this initial genetic shift, some of them would have developed immunity, therefore the Bureau was needed to keep evolving the strain of serum to meet these needs. VR never went into that aspect, only barely, and mostly just to set Tris apart from the rest of the divergents, or GP's. This plot line, IMO, was necessary for us to tie together the whole reason for Janine wanted to get rid of divergents in the first place, especially since she knew about the outside world. Simply not enough about that, but more to it later.<br />3. Evelyn's choice was unrealistic for the Evelyn that VR created, but not as a mother in general. The more realistic shift would have been for Tobias to give her a truth serum first, and then see how she really feels about him. Then give her the choice to take the memory serum once he sees that she really does love him. I have no clue why VR didn't think of that plot device first.<br />4. Uriah's coma is unrealistic in a world where the bio tech is so advanced that they have no means to revive a brain, but they can alter your genes for memory loss (which only targets certain parts of memory: ID, EGO, etc.)<br />5. The USA concept would have been much more developed if there was another installment, perhaps a prequel story of Edith Prior asa girl or maybe her parents.<br />6. The POV. I'm not sure why no one has mentioned this, but it was almost like VR read the Allie Condie trilogy, which IMO is MUCH better than the Divergent trilogy. In Condie's the WHOLE story is in POV with the two main characters, so you get to see the different personalities develop throughout. This is what makes the difference in creating dynamic protagonists vs. static protagonists. Tris was static: she never really went through any catharsis or personal transformation. She remained true to her original self, albeit a much braver and aware version of that self. It was Tobias who changed and became a second protagonist in the third book. Had she really thought this through she would have had both POV from the first book.<br />7. Not to beat a very dead horse here but Tris' death could have played out with her surviving the death serum, but in her weakened state, she falls prey to the memory serum. This would have kept her alive, but with no memory of Tobias. Then we would have been able to see, if after two years pass, she really truly had those qualities of sacrifice and bravery, as we were able to see that the memory serum really didn't change the core aspects of Peter. Then the real tragedy would have been Tobias having to exist near a person who he loves but has no memory of him. We could have seen him trying to befriend her and with his new self awareness, seen if they could have fallen in love again without all the baggage.<br />8. David was a crap villain compared to Marcus, and Marcus just breezed right on out into the fringe. A worse conclusion for David could have been that everyone finds out about who he really was and they make him till fields or some other crappy job. But because he works for the government he gets to still hang around? Once again, if memory serum just erases your memory, but leaves your core personality traits intact, then he would have eventually reverted to his old self.<br />9. Tobias workingfor the new government with Johanna is a great way for him to explore his new found qualities, but how about telling us what plans they have for this new government? What are his job duties? Is he trying to make do with what they have, or actually find a way to make a better world? Once again, this concept is much more fleshed out in Condie's novels.<br />10. Family first? Tris said her family was dead and Tobias was her new family. It is a point in this world that they are able to choose the people who they consider family by picking a new faction or staying with the ones they came from in the first place! Why did she suddenly feel the need to sacrifice for a brother who tried to kill her and never explained his reasons other than his boss was persuasive? puh-leeaaasseeee!<br />11. Since it's a YA novel, I will agree that the scenes were a bit racy, but even in Twilight they consummate after a wedding, so it's something that VR could have addressed with a similar plot device. However, I come from the generation of Judy Blume where teens having sex is a realistic way to shape and develop characters. It seems that this sexual tension between T & T was going to have to come to a conclusion at some point.<br /><br />In conclusion:<br /><br />Disappointing for a final in a trilogy. Some editor, somewhere in NYC, is getting fired for rushing this book, when clearly VR needed more time to think and develop her ideas. You don't see anyone rushing George RR Martin, because we don't mind WAITING FOR QUALITY!!!!!<br /><br />WOW! I think I just wrote a book report!<br /><br />I should have written this sodding trilogy myself!<br /><br />Who's with me???!!!!!
B000VDDDY6|5.0|this was just what i need to finish my star trek the original seires collection loved the an ecellent find.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I really love it! it is morbid and bloody but at the same time they show you is not real where it make you feel better.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I have this on my I phone but it will not load on my kindle fire says I don't have enough space but I do . Anybody have any ideas
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Wow...the action starts from the very first paragraph!!<br />It got my attention and kept it to the end.<br />If you want a fast paced action packed novel...then this is the one for you. Highly recommended 5 stars
006202406X|1.0|Spoiler Alert...<br />Why? I was so excited to read this book. Divergent-I loved. Insurgent-I loved. This was such a disappointing let down that I actaully wish I had never even started reading this trilogy. Also, I was excited to see the movie that is scheduled to come out soon. But since I am so upset about how the book ended I will not see the movies either. Why relive the disappiontment. There are enough disappointing endings is real life, could you not just give us the ending we wanted here? We just wanted to see Tris and Tobias end up living together in peace, don't they deserve that after all they have been through.<br />As for the rest of the book, it was very jumbled. There was 2 books worth of information crammed into one book which made it a bit much to take in. I did not enjoy this book as much as a whole. And I feel that the ending, in reference to the detail about the war/current state of the country, etc. was not informative enough.<br />If you have not started the trilogy, don't, you will just be let down. If you have read the other 2 books, don't bother with this one.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I love this book.  Once I started reading I couldn't stop.  I really appreciate the author's introspection through her journey in prison.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really like the game but I cannot say that i like the fact you only get 5 lives and  have to get friends to send you lives.  Or wait 30 min. It gets annoying fast in a game thats easy to get stuck on.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I loved this series.  I loved the science fiction and futuristic aspects in this series.<br />You should watch it.  Sarah Connor's and John Connor's characters were very intense.  I  also loved the Character of Mrs. Weaver/Robot.
B00C2IN7CG|5.0|Incredible picture quality and great casing...such a vast improvement on DVD...the only downside (for a nerd like me) was the cool insert cover is not part of the tin.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Good interface, easy to use. Cleared up over 2 gigs of space on my Kindle that was being taken up by games I had previously uninstalled (that I assume were save files or something). I only wish there was a way to delete pre-installed apps without rooting your device.
B005LAII1C|4.0|This movie was so much more funny than I thought it would be! I so want a smart-alec teddy bear to party with...add Flash Gordon in the mix and there is no way it could go wrong!
140006922X|1.0|This reads like a poorly produced movie trailer.  It is a Reader's Digest version of Western religions,  heavy on innuendo and short on fact. One wishes Mr. Aslan had studied his extensive  bibliography and offered notes that actually correlated with the text.  My advice; save your money.<br />,<br />,
B00C2IGQBA|5.0|I did not think there would be a big difference in the visuals between DVD, but I was wrong! This is sharp and gorgeous and the tin is very cool.<br /><br />My only complaint was the very cool sleeve is not part of the back cover and I felt like I violated the collector's code by opening it.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I don't own a smart phone and my computer service can be a bit dicey. Nor do I have TV beyond what's available for free. None of that stuff's in the budget. So this seemed a worthwhile investment. Unfortunately I'd already purchased a prettier app for a little more money. Neither are very accurate.<br /><br />They each choose the weather site for you. This one allowed me to make the choice once, when I first used it. Never after that. In fact I have no idea whose weather info I'm using now or even if this info comes from any place near me.<br /><br />Haven't used the alarm clock feature yet. I use this to check on th accuracy of the other program and vice versa. It's interesting the clocks on the two rarely agree. How hard can it be to get the time right?<br /><br />I'd appreciate (1) the option to check weather in an area of my choice, and in multiple areas (2) a more expansive readout, like the weather for the week, and (3) more accuracy would be useful. As it is, this app as well as the other is more a toy than a tool.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy it finally came on the kindle fire! Easier to play on this than my phone, yay!
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I must say the is the best overall body of work from Katy Perry as an artist and she dives deep into her heart broken soul to deliver a somber and uplifting record for her fans. Katy keeps it honest with her lyrics and showcase triumph from her divorce and a more mature side that being said this is a must have album it embodies and encompasses so many things relating to life challenges and takes the listener to a raw emotional mind state and yet uplifts your spirits to new heights just listening to prism.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!!! Hands down the most challenging, fun and addictive game I've played in a while..This game is amazing.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|this is amazing. i showed my French teacher a school and now our school has them on the school ipods. I have learned more in this app than i have in 2 years of French at school
B00908DDZM|5.0|This is a brilliant CD. The music and the words are amazing! He is real and has passion! Very talented.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I read it awhile ago and going to start up on the 2nd in this series. I have really enjoyed a lot of YA reads lately and this series I know will join in with my other favorites. There's action, twists, confusion. Some reviews I read didn't enjoy this read. I disagree! I am in my late 30's and loved it. Remember it's a YA read. Enjoy.
B000NDI3SK|2.0|Sad but true, I remember it fondly, purchased it and realized that it was truly a vintage tour of first generation computer graphic , etc. that gets in the way of his commentary, much like reading the old version of the Cambridge ancient history series when you know there is a much revised and better version out there.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|About as good of an album you can buy. Through and through each song is unique yet balances the others out. I love to put this on and album on with headphones and just soak it all in

034580404X|2.0|This is simply not for me.<br /><br />I've been an avid reader since my teens, picking up everything from works by Jean M. Auel, V.C. Andrews, Stephen King, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Anne Rice, and more. I've also had my share of reading works like those by Stephanie Meyer and of course, this particular author E.L. James.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that I am not impressed. After having read Anne Rices &#34;Sleeping Beauty&#34; series, I just didn't know what to expect of &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; other than I didn't expect it to be a boring, childish read. My immediate impression set in within the first 30 pages in which our beautiful college-level heroine steps into Greys office building and then interviews him in his office. Let me just say that the author went way too far with describing the color Grey by over-emphasizing &#34;Steel this&#34; and &#34;that looked like steel&#34; and &#34;steel.... steel.... steel...&#34;<br /><br />Very much written by an adult, I felt I was reading the lacking grammar and failed education of a child who tried to write his/her first book with this series. Story aside, the writing was lousy.<br /><br />I only hope the movie proves to be better as I at least won't be reading steel every other line.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Finished book one, currently on book two and looking forward to three.  I am fifty shades of caught-up.  Late start, but right on time.

B00571F26Y|5.0|I am going to go cold turkey after reading this very informative book.  I refuse to have surgery to loose weight so this sounds like it may be what I need not to mention I have  a hard  time tolerating the pain in my feet and joints.
B006WB7IN8|4.0|4.5 stars<br />This is a must read for those who like \\"grey\\", \\"travis\\", \\"tony\\" and this genre of abusive men. Abusive, humiliating relationships with crazy men - in this case, Lee - end like this, in a sweet romance HORROR thriller. In disaster.<br /><br />A bit on the repetitive side, telling and re-telling Cathy's OCD, maybe because OCD is absolutely annoying, specially when caused by such HORRIBLE AND DAMAGING RELATIONSHIP (?). IT'S a book that has everything in it, psychology, drama, love, friendship,<br />It annoyed me a bit because Cathy was always rude with the green-eyed, handsome, tall, broad, muscular, intelligent, studious, infinite patient, sweet, sweet Doctor Stuart. But, again, I can understand her deep fears of opening up again after such a trauma.<br /><br />But in the end I liked very much this thriller AND I RECOMMEND IT.<br /><br />Let me tell, you ladies, Stuart, this is a hot man. One that can appreciate a woman like she is, that knows how to cook, that don't yell, that don't kick things or tell you how to dress, how to depilate or whatever.<br />For you, Stuart, I give 5 million stars.
B00BC5KV42|5.0|Sokewhat hard to find a few models when the liting for a model is long (I.e. Epiphone Les Paul model) but I don't think the author can do much about that.
B002VHI8J0|3.0|I found it to be a slog of a read but ultimately worth the effort.  Storylines are convoluted and overly complicated but it's worth the effort.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Vimes doing what he does best. Sir Terry has a way with words. Probably the best Vimes book so far.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King did not disappoint on this novel. To truly enjoy it one needs to read The Shinning, not just base it on the original movie. I enjoyed the characters and the way they were woven together to bring the story along.<br />Well done Mr. King!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|The action is spectacular  3d is amazing  star trek is the familia movie with popcorn  I recommend I give 10 awesome star

B00DGGIXS6|5.0|I can remember watching the Sonny & Cher Show, and how beautiful her voice was and how beautiful she was.  She still has it going on.  I really like this CD and am glad she has a new one out.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Well, Elton John has been my favorite singer since I was very young, and I have never been disappointed.  I totally love this new CD.  I really like the three songs that are piano only.  Elton John outdid himself, this is a really great CD.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This was initially a good product but it was quickly downgraded in usability and promptly abandoned by Google. I was light years ahead with an HDMI cable connecting my TV to my PC 5 years ago. Just buy a Roku and be done with it. This half hearted effort by Google isn't worth a second glance in its current form.

B001EYU1VO|3.0|I have used this stick for over 2 years.  the twist will go one direction further than the other.  From the start it is very creeeeeky. and the throttle is flimsy.  It also has a large deadzone.  It has a lot of adgustability and has worked in every game I have used.  I really initially bought it for the dual throttle which is nice.  for the price I guess its ok.  if you are looking for a cheap joystick that is made cheaply and just works.  this works good.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|*SPOILER<br /><br /> I was so excited for this book and to be let down like this?<br />I dont't understand why any author would a end a trilogy like this. This series was one of the first ones I ever read and the one I fell deeply in love with. I recommended so many people to this series and now I wish I could erase this book from my life.<br /><br />I read the first hundred pages and couldn't even get pass much more after that. I knew that tris would died from the reviews since I didn't get the book until a day after the release but her death wasn't even memorable. So I decided to skip to the end and read Tobias POV after her death and there are no ways to describe the feeling I got. This book literally made my heart feel like it was ripped to SHREDS. How could an author hold out on a romance for so long and to think this book would be the one where they can actually be together happily but no. You went off and killed the main character while the rest live miserable lives. We deserved better than this. Veronica, you have now lost one of your loyal fans including many others.<br /><br />There was no hope at the end to leave me satisfied, this just left me emotionally drain.

B002UM5BXW|4.0|I've worked in the restaurant business and what Bourdain writes about are truths so poignant and deliciously hilarious. I must say though, I wasn't sold until the final chapter where he goes to Japan, a place where I have spent a quite a bit of my time. His book is an excellent read and I can't wait to read more from him :)!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I've loved the first two of this series and waited a YEAR from the last one to only be utterly disappointed in this one. Shocking your readers does NOT make you a good author or storyteller. There is a balance of telling the story the way the characters lead and a hopeful ending that leaves the reader satisfied. I'm so very very disappointed and sad about this book.

B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|First, let me say that Aslan is an excellent writer, which shouldn't come as a surprise given his background and education.  This work is no exception.  The book is an easy read and - for non-fiction - is paced very well.  Most folks can read the book in a day or so.<br /><br />The book also provides some interesting context for the story of Jesus insofar as the culture and times in which he lived.  It is not (and does not purport to be) a scholarly work.  Well, I say it doesn't purport to be, but Aslan does claim to have a some scholarly background in theology and religion and does represent the book as having been well if not meticulously researched.  Like some other reviewers, I knock a star off for not footnoting the work. If you're going to include references in each chapter to source material, then connect the source material to the specific claims you make.<br /><br />I knock another star off for over-stating as fact what virtually every scholar on every side of the question of the \\"historical Jesus\\" acknowledges as informed guess-work.  For instance:  we don't \\"know\\" when any of the gospels were written and Aslan consistently points to the latest possible dates for most of the gospels as if these dates were uniformly accepted if not established fact (at least he has them written within a hundred years of the death of Jesus - I saw one comment following another review that stated that the books were written \\"centuries\\" after the event!)  Another instance: he frequently cites to \\"Q\\" (Quelle) as if we actually had the document.  We don't.  Aslan does ultimately admit this, but a casual reader may very well conclude the document actually existed when in reality no one can make that claim (although many scholars consider it \\"likely\\").  One other instance - his characterization of the ending of Mark (the ending most scholars do agree upon - Mark 16:8).  I would simply encourage readers to take a look at the first eight verses of that chapter and compare it to what Aslan says about it to see for themselves what I'm saying.<br /><br />I won't knock a star off for bias because, although it is biased, it is clearly meant to be.  Aslan has a premise, clearly stated from the outset (it's in the title for goodness' sake): Jesus was a zealot like preacher who others subsequently overlaid with a message of peace.  This is not the consensus of New Testament or First Century scholars, however.  Aslan, in support of his premise, gives little acknowledgement of this.  Again, I don't knock off a star for this because Aslan is up front in telling us that these are his conclusions.  He's obviously read many others works and has developed his own understanding of where they lead.  Knowing that up front, I have no problem in recommending you read the book with the caveats already mentioned.<br /><br />If you do read the book, then I'd encourage you to read some of the works cited by Aslan in order to draw your own conclusions.  In particular, I'd recommend reading the more accessible works of N.T. (\\"Tom\\") Wright, as he is also eminently \\"readable\\" (except for his scholarly works).  I'd also recommend \\"The Writings of the New Testament\\" by Luke Timothy Johnson for another perspective on the Judaic, Greco-Roman, Hellenistic and Mediterranean culture of the time.<br /><br />One thing that Aslan (as well as other scholars) seem to miss is: \\"why?\\"<br /><br />Why did the writers of the four canonical gospels (not to mention the gnostic gospels) write what they did?  Why did these writings have the impact they did from so early on?  Some might argue that Aslan does address this within his major premise: that the evangelists wrote to conform the historical Jesus to the post-temple, Roman dominated and Greek influenced world.  I would first suggest that this is a simplistic explanation for what happened.  But I would also suggest that it misses the first and fundamental question of why there was a need to do so in the first instance.<br /><br />For the answer to that seminal question look elsewhere.  In the meantime, if you want to venture into the general area of the \\"historical Jesus\\" then Aslan's work, despite its shortcomings, is eminently readable and may whet your appetite for more.e answer to that seminal question look elsewhere.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I didn't want to like this show, but got hooked on the first episode. My favorites changed often through the season.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|While I didn't care for the ending, my low rating is not solely based on that.  The plot was too repetitive and I felt like I had to trudge through most of the book.  I'm not sure what was missing, but the chemistry between Four and Tris was not what it was in &#34;Divergent&#34; or even &#34;Insurgent&#34;.  Although I know why the author decided to write the story from both Four and Tris' point of view, I felt like they didn't have distinct voices.  I had to keep reminding myself of who was narrating through out the book because I couldn't tell just from their &#34;voice.&#34;  Overall, I was disappointed.  I loved &#34;Divergent&#34; and Tris and Four's story in that book.  I wasn't crazy about &#34;Insurgent&#34; but the middle book in a trilogy is often a bit lacklaster.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this show! It takes you back to a simpler time. People knew what they believed<br />and stood for it. They took their neighbors  for who they were, not what they did. Refreshing.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Really good read.  Although I find Mitch Albom a bit arrogant, I do enjoy his books and the fact that they are based on his life experiences.  I absolutely fell in love with the Rabbi.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was well written and had great character development!  At first I was concerned about the constant change of storytelling from the 1st person style of both main characters, but I found myself easily following along.  Great twists, unexpected ending, and overall GREAT writing made this a book I could not put down!
B008JFUQ3O|5.0|We just love the Minions and Despicable Me 2 did not disappoint.  Very funny movie that the whole family enjoyed.

B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Very insightful. I couldn't put this book down. It's teachings have already began to manifest in my life.<br />Very glad I read this book.
1781162646|4.0|Different.  Way to short a story.  I knew that going into it, but it still sucks when it ends.  Not into crime books, but this will be my only venture into that subject.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|I could not believe this was the same author of the Kiterunner.  The writing was totally disjointed and a struggle to read.  It did not get any better as you read into the book and I hope he gets it together for the next book.

B00FX8FQ76|5.0|Katy Perry has always been a great song maker whose fun and flamboyant style garnished true talent. In Prism she has finally touched home, wiser, maybe a little sadder but still upbeat and still in love with love, with life and her music. It has become my favorite of her three albums and is in my humble opinion a milestone work from a remarkable talent who will go on making hits for as long as she cares to. She is unique and rare and fast becoming a national treasure.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|5 Stars. ***Spoilers***<br /><br />This is my honest review. I truly appreciate Veronica Roth for sticking to her vision for her Divergent series. Allegiant was a bittersweet ending to an incredibly memorable story. I found Allegiant to be just as special as Divergent and Insurgent were - the action, suspense, plot twists and beautiful writing were all there. I am aware that I am among a small handful of readers that support Veronica Roth in her choice of how she wrote the ending to this trilogy. Still, I acknowledge that it was extremely painful to read and sad. Tris made a decision that was true to her character and her character growth. She was Dauntless and Abnegation rolled into one, and gave her life for others out of love. Her decision, while spontaneous, was a selfless and final act of love for her brother and the people residing in the city of Chicago. My only criticism would be that I found it hard to distinguish between the points of view for Tobias and Tris at times. The Divergent series is by far my favorite in the YA Dystopian genre, and I will always recommend these outstanding novels. I love Veronica Roth's writers voice and cannot wait to see what comes next!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Well-written.  Suspend your disbelief at the door (zombies with infinite energy) and you'll probably enjoy it.  I did like the narrative story-telling approach which is not something I recall reading before.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Pros<br />It's inexpensive<br />Small/compact & Easy to take on trips<br />Cool for YouTube<br />Cool for Netflix (if your traveling).  At home I have Roku in bedroom and family room has Netflix on TV and BluRay...so didn't really need it for that.<br />Cool for pictures and videos (worked well with my iPad Gen 2, not as well with my iPhone 4)<br /><br />Cons<br />That's it.<br />No other uses.<br />Wish it could mirror my iPhone and iPad!  I'll probably end up buying an Apple TV.<br /><br />Overall if you watch YouTube and Netflix, it's a cheap alternative to The $100 alternatives out there.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have enjoyed playing this on my phone, but I am excited to see it available once again on the Kindle Fire! Great game and lots of fun!

B00F8H0LM2|5.0|A fun, challenging game that doesn't become frustrating with it's complexity.  Great for all ages! Far better than the first Star Wars Angry Birds.
B004SVM7BW|2.0|Repligo is pretty fast, has a usable interface, and feels good to use.  It does really well with formatted text files like ebooks.  However, it does a horrible job with displaying scanned page books like what you'll get from archive.org.  The images are very blocky and pixelated.  Even if the handling of the text-y parts is a 5, this handling of scanned books brings it down to a 2 for usability for me.  ezPDF and Adobe Acrobat Reader are much quicker and display the scanned PDFs with no blockiness at all.  Actually, Adobe (surprisingly) is the best of the 3 for reading scanned books.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have been reading King for decades.  IN some recent books I thought he lost the plot and just wrote words to fill the page.  This book - while very different from his usual fare - is back to the Stephen King I remember.  I am now anxious to read Dr. Sleep.<br /><br />So, settle into your favorite reading chair, get your favorite beverage, pick up the (substantial) book or handy Kindle, and enjoy!<br /><br />BTW - My wife, not a King fan, also loved this book.

B008Y212PI|4.0|I DL'd this when it was the faotd. Graphics are nice. Gameplay is smooth on both tablet and phone. Nice music.
B00EY3EK1E|5.0|Another great album by a guy I'm thinking might be a genius. Simple yet peaceful with a touch of haunting story telling to mix it up. I don't know why, but it stirs childhood memories of visiting relatives in small farming communities who scrapped by on their sweat and hard work.
1781162646|3.0|From the pulp crime novel cover to the creepy tagline, one can tell you are about to step into the mind of Stephen King. King's narrator is Devin Jones and he takes the reader back in time to when he worked at the amusement park, Joyland. Devin meets a great group of friends that help him past his break up (because in your twenties any break up seems like it is the end of the world). He also discovers the secret of the Horror House ride...it's haunted.<br /><br />The story goes that Linda Gray came to the fair with her boyfriend. The boyfriend takes her on the Horror House ride and halfway through, slits her throat and tosses her out. All he leaves behind is a bloodied shirt and a pair of gloves. Now it is believed that Linda Gray haunts the ride waiting for her killer to be found.<br /><br />This story intrigues Devin and he decides to dig deeper to see if he can discover the identity of the killer. This fascination leads Devin on an interesting adventure that ends up putting him and his new found friends in danger.<br /><br />King has a way of making two complete different story lines come together flawlessly in the end. At times while you are reading you start to wonder what the importance of a scene is, but as long as you put your trust in King, he won't let you down. This is definitely not a hard core horror novel as most are used to from King but it isn't intended to be. This is just a story of love, loss, death and a bit of supernatural. I consider it a nice light mystery to read on a cold rainy day and hopefully will resonate with the younger readers and introduce them to the mastery of Stephen King.<br /><br />The audio version featured a great narrator, Michael Kelly. His youthful sounding voice was fitting for the age that Devin was.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|A really addictive game. Love the little gopher.  The announcers are a hoot. Plenty of levels to complete.  This game will keep you entertained for hours.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I won't get into any spoilers, but I will say that this book was a bit too long for my tastes (the story lines could've been resolved in about two hundred less pages).  However, Roth stayed true to her characters, and this was a fitting end to the series.
B0014JKJJI|4.0|I've owned 5-6 pairs of these for work... Love em... I have had one pair where the safety sole peeled off :( but this pair seems fine.. They are definitely a loose style shoe but I like that... On my feet on hard concrete 40 hrs a week couldn't live without my crocs!!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I literally had to force my way through this book, after I had flown through the first two.  Allegiant doesn't even feel like it's a part of the same series.  It's disconnected and flat.  I honestly didn't enjoy anything about this book.  It changes the entire series for me, and not for the better.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I thought there was a lot of repetition. It seemed like the book repeated itself and the other books. Although I still read it because I hate starting a book and not finishing it, I didn't enjoy it as much as the first book. I felt she tried to make it like the Hunger Games Series.
B008B68IUY|4.0|My niece wanted it and loves it.  It's a great size car for the girls what wants their Monster High doll to ride around lol. I like it!

B002QE3CTY|5.0|Wow.. a real page turner, I would call the book\\"wicked\\".I would highly recommend this book to anyone<br /> Who  enjoyed the hunger games or divergent
0545626382|4.0|I ordered these books on the recommendation of an adult friend, and  did enjoy them, but I am a little concerned about their rating as &#34;Young Adult&#34; books.  Not that I think that books should be censored at all, but I recently saw a class of 5th graders (about 10 years old) reading these.  Due to the intensely gory nature of the &#34;Games&#34;, I would hesitate to have an under-13 read them.  Although the writing itself was not outstanding, the plot was a pretty good one and moved quickly.  Yes, I know that the children I saw reading these books had probably also seen the movie, and yes, I know that we should all be glad that kids are reading at all, but I would still think carefully about the age-level of the reader if I were recommending them to kids or parents.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Excellent game...I love playing it.  all the time.  I have friends that are also addicted to this game. It's a challenge.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|If you love Stephen King, you will love this book; it is perfectly him. Reread The Shining to get the full effect, but you don't have to to enjoy the book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Such a fun and great game! Love it and love all the great challenges that you can complete. Never a boring day in the life of a minion
B002VXGW2E|4.0|While I love reading of Julia Child's time in France, I especially love watching the women cook and test different recipes throughout the movie. It helps renew my love of cooking, especially eggs and butter. :) Great, great movie!
006202406X|2.0|I considered giving this book one star, but, seeing as I was able to read it through, I can't deem it as awful.<br /><br />I'm an avid reader of fiction, with a particular interest in dystopian novels (The Giver was my first experience with this genre in elementary school). I've experienced the unparalleled writing styles of everyone from King to Collins to Rowling, and I began to hold Roth to the same standards.<br /><br />Divergent and Insurgent were captivating from start to finish, with Insurgent ending with an odd, but somewhat believable plot twist. Allegiant, however, saw the breakdown of what could have been a potentially multi-dimensional plot into one marked by shallow climaxes and repetition. The sudden change into a POV storyline seemed an interesting twist at first, but it was hard to distinguish Tris from Tobias. I thought (several times) that I would have to flip to the beginning of the chapter to remember whose POV I was in, but the other \\"lover's\\" name would often show up within the next line or two. I'm all about romance in a novel, especially since \\"Love & Romance\\" is a category the trilogy falls under, but the kiss scene often bordered on superfluous and even wasteful. I'd grown used to the action of the first two books, so to have that replaced with mini-fallout missions and intimate scenes seemed an unfair tradeoff.<br /><br />The character development was...lacking...to say the least. I read a review that saw Tobias as a character who began to think backwards, and I couldn't agree more. Rather than making Four reach his full potential, he seemed to retrogress into a more immature state until finally becoming a mere shadow of his former self by the end of the novel. Now, I understand that dealing with the loss of a loved one means losing yourself in grief, but it seemed that, after a while, his narration felt more like shallow a stream of consciousness rather than an intense narrative that should be given by someone of his age (although there were a few movements where his maturity did appear). As far as other characters are concerned, there were far too many that were underdeveloped. David, particularly, had the potential to become someone sinister with a more obvious \\"plot twist\\" of his love for Tris's mother (which was apparent very early on). At one point, there were just many other characters that only did a couple of things each; I felt like many of the attributes could have been given to one or two new people, who could have in turn been dynamic characters, rather than just many static ones.<br /><br />The most disappointing element here was the senseless killing off of characters. I can understand the deaths of some major characters as necessary to move a plot along (Potter series) or to illustrate the inevitability of saving someone close to you (Hunger Games trilogy), but it is an entirely different thing when the protagonist is killed (by a character who honestly didn't deserve the right--and got away with it later) with no useful plot movement. Tobias had already neutralized the problem back in Chicago, and Tris had done the same back at the Bureau. An \\"ultimate sacrifice\\" of her somehow coming in contact with the memory serum and Tobias having to deal with the repercussions of it would have been a more reasonable ending that wouldn't cause such a disloyalty between the Roth and her fans. The fact that Four could hear Tris' voice calling him through the haze of the attack simulation (with no other explanation but \\"the power of love\\"), but Tris could not be saved from death (even after finding out she was immune to the death serum) seemed like an even greater insult; the logic was simply discontinuous.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This story is unique in that the narrator is Death. It also gives the reader an unusual perspective. The story is touching and heartfelt.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|While the scenes themselves are a bit hard to see, the storyline is interesting and the mini games are fun. Patience is the key for the energy level ups, or spend the cash but you shouldn't need to
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another fine suspense filled book by John Grisham.  Had a hard Tim putting it down to go to work in the morning robed at night. A must read.

B004SD5GZ4|3.0|This app is difficult to use. I have downloaded some media only to find out that I didn't download it. Maybe this person who has been with computers since they were made of vacuum tubes doesn't know much about computers. I'll admit.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am glad to get it finally.  The last time I downloaded it all I got was the directions.  It is nice to be able to play Candy Crush on my tablet.
0385350864|3.0|I was so excited to hear a new Bridget Jones book was coming out I actually did something revolutionary for me...I preordered it. I kind of knew before I even picked it up that it would be disappointing...I didn't like the fact that Mark Darcy was dead. I sort of would rather have left her with her happy ending, or maybe it would have been better if the sequel was about their marital troubles. That being said, I do love Bridget and I don't think I could actually dislike any book about her. But...at the age of fifty-one, I would kind of hoped she'd have grown up a bit. After all, the woman has a nanny and a housekeeper and is a stay at home mother but still can't get it together enough to pick up her kids on time? I also found the bits about her texting in her meetings extremely irritating. I wanted to reach into the book and scream, \\"PUT THE PHONE DOWN!\\" Personally, I think that behavior is so rude. I also found it BEYOND depressing that she was still going to the same kind of events that she went to in her thirties and she was now a singleton again and she STILL was unable to make peace with it. Also, parts of the book were extremely unrealistic...for instance, although she is portrayed as somewhat gluttonous and impulsive she somehow manages to lose forty pounds in a very short period of time with no regain and little to no maintenance. I also thought it was unrealistic that she'd be fifty-one years old which such small children. Yes, I do know people do have children later in life, but by my calculations she and Mark Darcy had to have been married about nine or ten years when they had their first child and why would they have put it off like that? Didn't make sense to me. The whole boy toy story left a bad taste in my mouth. No normal good looking twenty-nine year old man would want to be with a fifty-one year old woman unless he was using her, and it didn't seem plausible to me that Bridget's friends would encourage this disaster. My friends would have plenty tosay if I were dating a man twenty years younger, trust me...not to mention, I wouldn't do it to begin with. The ending also was predictable from the first pages...I knew how the book would end up...and it was very close to the earlier books. All in all, if you love Bridget, you would enjoy the book, as I did...you wouldn't necessarily LIKE the book. Kind of odd, but that's how I felt about it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I ducking loved this book (to say it bluntly like tiffany would have). I was surprised by the writing style being so simple, but that might be because of pat 's brain and his way of thinking. I'd definitely recommend this book, even for guys (such as myself). 4.7/5
B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|Such a cute movie that when my sister came to visit, I ordered it and watched it again with her as I knew she would like it, too.  A great romantic comedy and you can't go wrong with Meryl Streep!

B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I have been an avid Stephen King reader for almost 30 yrs and have sadly watched his work suffer over the years. He has reached the point that people will read and buy his books based on his name and he seems to know this and at times will crank out drivel mocking us as fans.<br />This book had more forethought then many of his newer books, but it still didn't grab and hold on to you calling you to read the next chapters like his earlier works would. He has become complacent, sorry Stephen I love ya, but you have and you know it and so do your dedicated fans. Bring the A game back dude!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Love it!!!!! It workes I can wutch on a big screen in my bed!! Gr8 pics doesn't get stuck yay
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Set on earth in our time rather than far into the future, this fast paced book is a sheer joy to read and if time had allowed, I would've read it straight through because once started I really didn't want to put it down! The main characters are believable and likeable, the action packed storyline is fascinating, definitely original and filled with surprising and unexpected twists that keep it interesting, and the writing is expertly suited to the story. A blend of theoretical physics, new age paranormal beliefs and historical elements, this story is a biting commentary on modern society that's close enough to truth to make it frightening! This world and time spanning story has something for everyone. It is one of the most interesting and entertaining books I've read and as soon as I finished reading it I immediately bought the second book of the series, which is as good as the first, and look forward to next volume, scheduled for release in November, 2013! I don't have a lot of time for reading, but I'll make time to read the third book of the series just as I did with the first two, and it's rare that I enjoy a book that much. I highly recommend this series!
B0034G4P80|5.0|I really liked this movie though it had its weak points.  I don't think enough is done with Jane.  The destroyer was cool and I liked Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Chris Hemsworth as Thor.

1451626088|4.0|Philippa Gregory did such a good job making Anne Neville a sympathetic character that I now really hate Elizabeth Woodville and her entire family.  While I must give credit to any author who can tell the same story from so many genuine and compelling viewpoints (it's a civil war, after all: everyone thinks they're right, and emotions are overwhelming) this book is going to make it hard for me to read the next in the series.  The White Princess will be from the viewpoint of Elizabeth of York, who I now view as a selfish little witch.  Since I've already bought the book, I hope I can shake off my loyalty to Anne Neville long enough to let Elizabeth tell her side of things.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|First and foremost, this is a YA novel. It is not Orwell or Huxley, so expecting the writing to fly off the page and create a vivid, disturbing world is completely unrealistic. That said, the writing was oftentimes slightly disappointing when compared with the other novels.<br /><br />Getting immersed in the novel is troublesome: it is halting and stuttering for the first half. Roth seems to have lost her rhythm and keeps throwing the exact same obstacle at her characters disguised as different problems (A rebellion here... a rebellion here... a rebellion here... a rebellion here... it is an interesting look into a country that's collapsing, but it becomes quite too predictable).<br /><br />As interesting as it was stylistically to switch chapters between Tris and Tobias's point of views, that creates a disjoint: there is none of the continuity of the first two books. Once you're immersed in Tris's narrative, her chapter ends, and suddenly you are forced to remove yourself from her brain and try to enter Tobias's head. Also, the style of voice for each character isn't quite differentiated enough to really allow this separation to fully take place. There were times when I would forget whose head I was in, and it was simply because the style did not change enough to move me from one to another.<br /><br />However, having finished the book, the conceit makes more sense. We had to have a look into Tobias's head.<br /><br />As for those who disparage Roth for ending it the way she did, I, too, was disappointed. Yet Tris always did things true to her character: things she had done in the first book and in the second. There was no other way for Roth to end the series and have Tris remain an authentic person. Sure, we all want a happy ending, but doing so would be a cop out. How likely would it be for a sixteen year old girl to survive all of the things Tris has survived? Not very. Add that to her self-sacrificing tendencies and what you get is exactly what Roth wrote. WasI angry? Yes. Heartbroken? Definitely? Did I spend the last eighty pages or so of the book crying, wiping my eyes, aware of what was going to happen? Yeah. But then again, I'm a writer, and as a writer, I would have been extremely frustrated if Roth had ended it happily for everyone. That's simply not realistic.<br /><br />So while I am sad that I didn't get the storybook ending a la The Hunger Games or Harry Potter, I am happy that, for once, an author was realistic about what would happen to a traumatized sixteen year old girl in extraordinary circumstances who has survived way longer than probable.
B000003NA4|4.0|Diana Krall was one of the first female Jazz singers that I collected. I have 7 CDs of hers & this is my favorite. Maybe because it was my first CD of hers I bought & tend to judge music from the original source. I read some of the negative reviews & I am shocked. Some write that she can't sing; that she is too airy or forcing a female version of Frank Sinatra. Sure there are better singers out there in the Jazz world, I prefer Cassandra Wilson, but Diana Krall has a certain emotional match to the words. She does more than sing, her voice expresses the meaning. Some write that there are better female piano players out there & I agree: Patricia Barber is one of the best jazz piano players but her music is less romantic & sometimes the songs have weird subject matters. Therefore Diana Krall is a package deal: a fine singer & piano player with a certain style. This is a great CD both in song & sound production. I give the CD a rating of 4 because my tastes lean towards the experimental & this CD is almost on the POP side. To most popular Jazz lovers this is surely a 5. If you're just starting your Jazz collection, this would be a good place to start.

0385738781|3.0|I feel like The Death Cure is to the Maze Runner series what Mockingjay was to The Hunger Games series. I don't think the series is about falling in love. I realize that it's not. I think the focus should be about the dystopian world and the justification of horrible thing with good intentions. But it's so hard when the final book sinks your ship and kills off one of your favorite characters.<br /><br />In the final installment of The Maze Runner trilogy, the remaining Gladers have been tried, tricked, and tested. All they want is a cure and Wicked stopped. No matter why Thomas originally agreed with Wicked, at this point of the trilogy he just can't understand it or the organization itself. They've messed with him, his head and his friends enough. For a cure that they still don't have, yet? But as a division occurs within the remaining Gladers about Wicked and finding the cure for the Flare.<br /><br />Despite my disagreement with the romantic aspect of the novel and series, I really liked parts of this novel. It made me think about the lines between actions and good intentions. For the most part of this series, and the novel, I didn't believe Wicked was this horrible organization. I understood they were doing horrible things to children, and I understood the logical reasoning behind their actions, even though I didn't agree with it. Then there is a moment at the end of The Death Cure that challenges my belief. I just don't understand it. It felt like Dashner was undermining the complexities of this organization by decisively determining that they were bad (or at least most of the people apart of this organization was). I honestly didn't want a definitive answer to that particular question because I think it takes away from the debate. How far are you willing go? Do the benefits of a few outweigh the benefits of the mass?<br /><br />By leaning one way or the other in determining if Wicked was an evil organization, Dashner takes away from the bigger picture. It kind of gives a simple answer to a complex question.<br /><br />Other than the big philosophical issues that arise, the reader finally gets some conclusion to some answers. Answers, that I personally felt, hurt by. Not everyone lives kiddos. Dashner hasn't been shy about axing off some major characters in the series, and The Death Cure isn't any different especially with the stakes raised at their highest.<br /><br />No matter what you say about The Death Cure, I think we can all agree it's an adventure.of gives a simple answer to a complex question.<br /><br />Other than the big philosophical issues that arise, the reader finally gets some conclusion to some answers.

B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|The Conjuring along with Insidious represent two of the best horror films made in a very long time. Director James Wan truly is a master at the genre. Insidious revived the genre of horror that had become stale and predictable over the last 20 years. With the arrival of Insidious audiences had a reason to be scared for the first time in many years. It's something of a horror classic. In fact it might well be one of the best horror films ever made. It's filled with fresh new ideas, fantastic production values, great unpredictable moments, and some truly scary sequences. The Conjuring may very well be an even better horror movie. Wan manages to fill the film with many memorable and scary moments, while making it completely different in form and style from Insidious. As I watched it I kept asking myself \\"Might this be a new modern day horror masterpiece?\\" Well not quite, but it comes very close. There are few moments in the film that let's the audience off the hook, it's filled with plenty of genuine scares, and lots of good old fashioned horror.<br /><br />How many horror movies has there been made that are better than The Conjuring? That is an important question. In my opinion maybe about 10 or 15. Maybe a few more. I've seen everything under the sun, from the most taboo gore films to the most atmospheric of the genre. Despite that this movie made me truly feel horrified several times. It also managed to creep me out big time. The film has some weaker moments, but even those are done to perfection, such as an exorcism sequence near the end. James Wan is clearly a director who knows how to scare the crap out of audiences, or at least jaded horror fanatics like me. Up till near the end I was convinced James Wan's new film is a new modern horror masterpiece. I'm still trying to  decide if that is fitting or not. One thing is for sure, this is one of the best horror movies I have seen in quite some time.<br /><br />I'm eager to see what Mr. Wan does next. Of Wan's work I've only seen Insidious and this one, and both are truly excellent horror movies, done with style, and class. I'm in awe of Wan and the magic he's managed to create within both of these films. Not since The Exorcist and a few other classics like it have I been genuinely horrified by and felt like I've had the bejesus scared out of me like both these Wan films have managed to do. James Wan is exactly what the title of this review indicates. The new master of horror, and The Conjuring is truly a very well made and genuinely scary experience to sit through.'ve only seen Insidious and this one, and both are truly excellent horror movies, done with style, and class.

0385738765|4.0|The Scorch Trials takes place immediately after The Maze Runner, and after the Gladers have finally escaped the Maze but the test and the mind games are far from over. The Gladers areput into another test, unlike anything they have experienced, and life-threatening in a different kind of way. It's all about testing variables and finding a candidate to cure a disease know as the Flare that will eventually make those who caught it go crazy.<br /><br />I had to major issues with The Scorch Trials. Primarly, I hated the pacing. I didn't feel that same connection like I did with The Maze Runner. In The Maze Runner, while everything was happening so quickly, it was so easy for me to get sucked in and not realize my surrounding. I was totally absorbed in the book. With The Scorch Trials, a lot was happening but I was utterly aware of what was happening. I couldn't just dive in and immerse in the Gladers' world. Although a lot was happening, it felt like it was happening painfully slow.<br /><br />Another issue I had with the novel, is something that I attribute to myself, than on Dashner's part. I just couldn't fully imagine this world especially outside the Maze and the Wicked compound. It wasn't like Dashner wasn't descriptive, because he was, but I just couldn't compute the immensity of this other desert-like place. I understood that the conditions were horrible, but if you asked me to describe it, I couldn't. I think this lack of comprehension totally affected my enjoy of novel. I feel like The Scorch Trials is supposed to raise the stakes but because I didn't understand the environment, I couldn't fully understand the risks.<br /><br />Not that The Scorch Trials doesn't have it's moments because there are some moments that will make your heart stop. Especially towards the end. Ohh the plot twist.

006202406X|1.0|SPOILERS: I should start by saying I LOVED the first two books, Divergent especially. Allegiant was so terrible it forced me to log in and write my first review.<br /><br />If you loved the first two books DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE! Tris isn't Tris, and Four ... well, he may as well be Twenty-Four for the amount of fears he has. He's no longer the strong badass 'Four' of Divergent, but a weak, pathetic, loser of a character. It's a travesty! What happened to Four?!<br /><br />Writing from two perspectives was a dud move - the two POVs are confusing and the characters sound exactly the same (part of the problem with Four is this 1st POV characterisation - he reads like a 14-yr old girl).  The characters don't have their own voice. It reads like bad fan-fiction.<br /><br />And then there's the writing...how many times do we have to hear that Four tasted like salt? That Tris felt her heartbeat in her fingertips? Boring, boring, boring, and repetitive. The first two books had tension and excitement and the scenes between Tris and Four were touching and felt new. Allegiant is just a rehash, and a bad one; Tris and Four's scenes together are BORING. What happened? Where's the chemistry? It's a fail, Veronica Roth, a fail. And as for the action sequences? What action? Honestly, I am still shocked what a dud this book is.<br /><br />And then there's the plot - what plot? I devoured the first book, enjoyed the second, but Allegiant - wow. It's boring. Nothing happens for the first 3/4 of the books and then wham, bam - there's a final cheap shot from the author which severs  all the delicate trust she's built up with the reader. I found myself not caring about the characters - and I LOVED these characters!! They're written as boring and one-dimensional - Christina, Cara, Uriah, Tris, Four - they were just cardboard cutouts. And the bunch of new characters thrown into the trilogy?  Their sole purpose is to force Tris's hand into her final sacrifice. Four's instructor Amar? We should have heard his NAME at least in the first book.<br /><br />I'm returning my copy. DON'T read this if you loved the first two books. Disappointing, boring, cheap-shot read, worth 0 stars.

Each season comes in a separate case (6 discs each) and each disc snaps into its tray - no sliding it into a cardboard sleeve.<br /><br />One of our cases did have a half inch of plastic come off where the front/back snap together but it doesn't affect the look or function of the box.<br /><br />The disc content is the same as the older complete set and the combined individual discs.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|When I heard that Stephen King was writing a sequel to what I consider one of his best novels The Shining, I was both eager and hesitant to pick it up. Part of me was eager to see where King would take the characters from the world of the Overlook Hotel in the sequel and hesitant because of the track record of other authors with \\"long awaited\\" sequels.<br /><br />The good news is that Doctor Sleep is a worthy and successful sequel to The Shining on just about every level. And I think it's a good thing that King wrote it thirty or so years after the original hit our shelves.<br /><br />Picking up right where The Shining left off, Doctor Sleep chronicles Dan's attempts to not become his father's son. Dan reaches rock bottom when he steals the last $70 from his single-mother, one-night-stand's purse, after blowing his entire paycheck on drugs and booze the night before. The incident haunts Dan throughout the novel and serves as a motivation to change and help others. He does this working in hospices, using his power to see dying people through their final moments of life and when he becomes aware of another young person who shares his unique ability.<br /><br />That is Abra, a young girl who may be even stronger in her power than Danny was and is. Her abilities confound her parents as well as making her a bit of an outcast. In addition, it brings her onto the radar of a nomadic group of people who feed on \\"the steam\\" of young people with psychic abilities. To the group, Abra is like a buffet of extended-life and health-benefits for them and they're eager to find her to not only feed now, but to stock up for a long time to come.<br /><br />King spends the first half of the novel putting introducing the characters and plot threads before he begins to pull out all the stops in the second half. The novel feels like a train, building up speed slowly before racing to its ultimate, page-turning finish. And yet at over five-hundred pages, Doctor Sleep never feels like its overstaying its welcome or treading water. In fact, had it gone another hundred or so pages, I would have been perfectly content to keep on reading and spending time with these characters.<br /><br />It's a testament to King's second-half career renaissance that he can pull off not only a book this good, but a sequel that works this well. He may have taken close to thirty year to write the novel, but I'm glad he had that time to hone his craft and to really decide if a sequel was necessary and would add to his original novel.<br /><br />King also manages to throw in a bit of a shout-out to his son Joe Hill's latest novel NOS4A2 in the early goings of the novel. And while I didn't catch a shout-out to his daugher-in-law Kelly Braffet's brilliant novel, Save Yourself (review coming soon but do yourself a favor and pick up a copy immediately), I wouldn't be shocked it there was one in there as well. It even contains a bit of a homage to King's recent Hardcase Crime entry Joyland.<br /><br />Of course, the big question that most fans will be wondering is -- is this novel a worthy sequel to The Shining?<br /><br />The short answer is, yes, absolutely.<br /><br />The Shining was the story of one man's alcohol-fueled descent into madness. Doctor Sleep is (partially) the story of the impact those events had one on man and how he deals with it over the course of the next thirty years. Dan Torrance, for good and bad, is his father's son. And while Dan doesn't do something quite as viscerally repulsive as Jack breaking young Danny's arm in a fit of rage, his low point of taking the cash and his internal justification for doing so show him to be just the kind of guy his dad was. Dan's struggle his addictions and his power throughout his life inform a large portion of the novel and the choices made. It's a fascinating character study by King and, in many ways, that sets this novel at or near the same level as The Shining.<br /><br />But Doctor Sleep is also competing with my fond memories of reading the original and being absolutely glued to every page. It's hard to recall that much of The Shining is a slow burn, building up to the pulse-pounding climax. It's easy to remember the horrific nature of Jack Torrance's chasing his wife and son through the hotel and not recall everything King did to build up to that point.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep starts on a slow burn as well and builds to a pulse-pounding finale. But the seeds King sews about his characters make the first half just as memorable as the second -- at least in my short term memory. It will be interesting to see how in the months and years to come what I remember from this novel as compared to the original.<br /><br />In the end, Doctor Sleep is a worthy successor to The Shining and another triumph for Stephen King. If you haven't read the original, I can't recommend it enough. And then give this one a try. It's a very different reading experience but one that is just as satisfying.mories of reading the original and being absolutely glued to every page.

B0058UXHHK|4.0|A surprising read for a freebie book.loved the witty poor disillusioned Rose. VIOLET not so much...I kept expecting her to be involved somehow.

Thanks for entertaining me and a great little mystery. Oh and dear stinky Muffy,what an unexpected treasure.
1250030951|4.0|After their mother left, twin sisters Cath and Wren lost themselves in the fantasy world of Simon Snow. That included devouring the books and creating their own fan-fic based set within the world of Simon.<br /><br />Now that two are headed off to the same college and Cath is having a difficult time adjusting to the changes in her life. Wren wants to live with someone else and Cath, who is a bit shy and socially awkward, can't quite work up the gumption to go to the cafeteria to eat her meals. Instead, she's content to sit in her dorm room and continue work on her fan-fic masterpiece.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell's Fangirl is an unlikely coming of age story that rings absolutely, authentically true on page after page. Rowell ably handles a potential love triangle for Cath with deft ease and avoids many of the cliches associated with that genre. The story is populated with a variety of authentic, likeable characters for Cath to interact with, including her roommate. Rowell also doesn't infodump Cath and Wren's backstory and their complicated relationship with their mother and father, but instead gives us glimpses into it as strategic points.<br /><br />What it all adds up to is one of the more delightful, entertaining and moving novels I've read this year. Sure, this novel is probably going to get shelved in the young adult section of your bookstore or library, but I encourage you to not let that keep you from reading it. The story of Cath's struggles is one that can and will appeal to many, regardless of your age.<br /><br />One of my favorite books I've read this year.

I think most starwars fans are apple-hating geeks, so this would be 80% of your market Amazon.. you gotta fix this up!<br /><br />I'm giving this 3 stars until there's full Android support.

0761169253|5.0|I bought 10 books for my graduating daughter and her friends, most of whom's talents I have watch develop over the years.  I thought this was the perfect present to remind them, to recognize  their gifts and use them. After reading Steal Like An Artist,  I started using the suggestions daily.  I  scan a page, and  I write each night. I have learned about myself. No plans but more will be revealed. I do feel  I am a stronger, more confident parent and friend, and less afraid to be creative; which in turn I  pass on to my children. I am blessed to have stumbled upon this fantastic little book, that changes the rules a bit. Which is needed. Technology has changed the way life is lived, things are created,  jobs are created, and passions are pursued. This book is about honesty in a sense that it is a different world today, one is  still creative, there are different rules and here are the tools. It's up  to the individual  to go forward with  fortitude, and make a difference in the world. It's supportive, it gives permission, it encourages integrity. I love it. I keep a couple extra for gifts because this book is a treasurer. Thank you, Austin

In the third book they act more mature and as though they actually like and trust each other.

055358894X|4.0|I thought this book was terrific!  You can tell he is getting his writing feet under him only when he is writing about &#34;present-day&#34; Locke Lamora.  When he goes back into Locke's childhood, the author becomes immediate, clear and fun.  I enjoyed the entire book but you can tell he will only get better.  I've read three of his books so far, and I can say without a doubt he does get better, his third book has no issues whatsoever except that it ends.  The world is real, gritty and exciting.  The plots are complicated, bizarre, clever and he writes in a clear enough style that you can easily follow his surprising twists and turns.  the development of characters are stunning and grabs you right from the beginning.  i don't want to tell you about plot etc. because i think any tidbits will give something away, so don't read everyone's details.  the details are in the book it is worth buying.  although i read mine from the library i now regret i didn't purchase it since my whole family wants to read it, and i want to re-read it and it is a &#34;popular check-out&#34; at my library.  i've already put the library on notice to pre-order his fourth book, which i am impatiently waiting for.  His first two books drops hints about characters and you wonder about them.  Never fear, the republic of thieves his third book he introduces other characters fully and develops locke's childhood further.  His eye for detail, his storytelling, the charm of the characters, the strange settings and customs of the various places/cities, all make for an enjoyable read.  this is a refreshing take on the fantasy genre for those of us who feel we have read it all what more could someone write?  well, scott lynch certainly came through, fresh, invigorating and with complications, fun and verve.  the investment in buying is indeed worth the read.

Neil Young has made a lot of great music but he had a run in the late 70s that was his best ever and this was and remains his crowning achievement--an album that can stand next to albums like &#34;Let it Bleed,&#34; &#34;Who's Next&#34; and &#34;Eat a Peach&#34; as timeless rock and roll classics that will still sound good in a thousand years if we live that long.

However, the more I listen to this album the more I realize that this is Paul at his best.  &#34;New&#34; is fresh and interesting.  Is it groundbreaking musically?  No, but rarely is anything else.  There isn't a bad song on this album.

B00BH0VSM6|4.0|THE BAT is the first in the series, but was only recently made available in English and for Kindle. I was thrilled to read it, as the subsequent books in the series refer to Harry's investigation of a serial killer in Australia. But as I gobbled it up, literarily speaking, one thought kept surfacing: this is a strange way to start a detective series.<br /><br />The book introduces Harry Hole as an Oslo detective sent to Sydney, Australia to assist in the investigation of the murder of a Norwegian woman who was a moderately successful Norwegian TV star. His guide throughout the investigation is an Australian detective named Kensington who is of Aboriginal descent. Kensington's boss isn't thrilled to have Harry there and wants to shut him out even as Kensington keeps introducing Harry to strange folks in the outback as well as in bars in Sydney's red light district called King's Cross.<br /><br />Now, I've been to both Oslo and Sydney (including a night of clubbing in King's Cross) and the two cities have a lot in common. They are both vibrant and modern with an athletic vibe and a well-educated populace.  Lots of tall white people in rock band tees. Just like Harry.<br /><br />But Nesbo makes the differences really speak to the reader by using the murder investigation to reveal the lifestyle, history, and integration difficulties of Australia's Aboriginal population. We discover pain and passion through Harry's eyes in a way that neither the Norwegian detective nor the reader expect to do so.<br /><br />The serial killer does bad stuff, the ending is full of suspense, a romance goes awry, and the roots of Harry's self-destructive behavior--more of a central issues in later books--are revealed. But overall, I can't shake the feeling that this was an odd way to start a mystery series, because at no time do we see Harry as particularly Norwegian or in his natural element. We don't meet his colleagues or understand the context for any continuing series. I recognized places in Australia, and loved the great descriptions, easy dialogue, and twisty plotting. But I'm not sure I'd be compelled to read more in a series set in Norway if I only had this story to go on.<br /><br />Bottom line? Read THE BAT by Jo Nesbo, but not as your introduction to the Harry Hole series.
B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|The new remix album, \\"Love to Love You Donna\\" contains 13 cuts, of which one is a 'new' song that was recorded shortly before Donna Summer's death in 2012.  For the most part, the album is enjoyable, though none of the remixes outshine the original recordings.  As with any remix album, there are highs and lows.  First, the good:<br /><br />Giorgio Moroder's reworking of \\"Love to Love You, Baby\\" amps up the bass and the tempo and sprinkles in a few musical samples from his 70's work including \\"I Feel Love\\" and \\"Utopia.\\"  While this production doesn't veer too far from the original, it is a fun listen.<br /><br />Frankie Knuckles and Eric Kupper tackle \\"Hot Stuff\\", stripping the song of its original 'rock' element and turning the sultry 'come on' into an airy, late-night groove.  Totally listenable, though the sexual tension and immediacy of the original is lost in the remix.<br /><br />\\"Bad Girls,\\" as remixed by Gigamesh, retains the playfulness of the original recording, as well as most of the vocals.  It's a fun, bouncy reinvention that is sure to fill a dance floor or two.<br /><br />The Masters at Work remix of the seminal \\"Last Dance\\" begins awkwardly (the vocals don't match the beat), but eventually synchs up and manages to build to a powerful crescendo about three-fourths through the cut.  Give this one a chance and you will play it often.<br /><br />Both the Afrojack and Benga remixes of the electronic classic \\"I Feel Love\\" are pleasant but don't really add anything we haven't heard before in every remix of the song that has been released since Patrick Cowley's version in the early 80's.  I'm not sure anyone could improve on the original.<br /><br />And finally, \\"Working the Midnight Shift,\\" as imagined by Holy Ghost, is the absolute best cut on the album, with a very current backing track and a vocal by Tiffany Roth.  This production would sound right at home on any urban radio station today.  While it would have been nice to have Donna Summer's original vocals, I'm assuming they simply were not available in a format that allowed for a clean-sounding, modern production.  In addition to the stellar backing track, the song works well since it was never a hit single and is not competing with the memory of Top 40 days gone by.<br /><br />And now for the rest:<br /><br />Both Duke Dumont's \\"Dim All the Lights\\" and Jacques Greene's \\"On the Radio\\" are curious mis-steps that retain none of the fun of the original recordings (or much of the vocals or melody).  For completists only.<br /><br />Chromeo's take on \\"Love is in Control\\" is competent and current, but the original song wasn't very good to begin with so the ridiculous lyrics are made even moreso in this stripped down version.  The original song  made the US pop chart based solely on the reputation of the participants (it was produced by then super-hot Quincy Jones) and fell off the Top 40 chart like a ton of bricks after peaking at #10.<br /><br />Laidback Luke's remix of \\"MacArthur Park\\" is pure cheese and really illustrates that the best way to present a dance version of this complex song is exactly how it was done by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte in 1978.  Painful to the ears in either the dub or full vocal versions.<br /><br />I love Hot Chip, but their version of \\"Sunset People\\" slows down the tempo of the original to the point that it is boring.  They have managed to turn one of Donna's most frenetic and exciting songs into a mind-numbing, lethargic mess despite the fact that they had the original vocal track and musical stems from which to build a new song.  Yikes.<br /><br />And finally, the 'new' song \\"La Dolce Vita.\\"  I really was hoping that this tune was going to be on par with Donna's classics, but the best thing about it is the hooky refrain.  The production of the backing track is quite good, but the lyrics of the verses are repetitive and simple-minded, which ultimately sink the track.  It is, however, nostalgic to hear Moroder on the vocoder and serves as okay background music.<br /><br />Many fans are complaining that the remixes don't do justice to the legacy of Donna Summer.  I'm guessing the complainers haven't played the best cuts loud on a home stereo or are so stuck in the 70's that they can't accept that these remixes were really made to capture a new, younger audience.  They definitely sound amazing at full volume and are sure to get you up and dancing if you give them a chance.

B005LAIH2W|4.0|Great fun.  A lot of people are going to say that it copies everyone until you tell them that the original novel was what inspired George Lucas and James Cameron.  In fact, the film, for all its confusion, is actually better and more coherent than it's source, which was a serial pretty much made up as the author went along.  Nice visuals, fun characters, good pace, funny dog (well, not a dog really, but near enough).  It actually did fairly well at the box office, but just not enough to warrant sequels, which is a pity.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|Very disappointed that Joe Cocker Ultimate collection was the wrong CD.<br /><br />Happy about free replacement offer but disappointed to never receive the replacement.

B004SUDPWI|5.0|I was given a Blu-ray player as a Father's Day present several months ago, and that prompted me to look for some movies I hadn't watched in a long, long time. The first one I got was \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\", the 1963 movie from director David Lean, which was upgraded for Blu-ray in the most of fantastic ways, truly an eye-opener. It is only natural that I would also want to check out this, another one directed by David Lean.<br /><br />\\"The Bridge On the River Kwai\\" (1958 release; 161 min.) is a movie I have watched a number of times before, but probably not in the last 10, or even 15 years. As I watched this once again after all these years, I couldn't help but feel what a marvel it is. There isn't much \\"action\\" in this movie (but for the very last part), yet at over 2 1/2 hrs. long, it nevertheless kept my attention from start to finish. For the first hour or so, it is a psychological thriller (the stand-off between the Japanese camp leader and the British officer, played brilliantly by Alec Guiness. When the British officer protests yet again that something is against \\"the rules\\", the Japanese officer hisses back \\"this is war! this is not a game of cricket\\", just fabulous. After that, we see the slow evolution into a nail-baiter, even though we all know how it's going to end. It's hard to imagine how a movie like that could be made today. Bottom line: 55 years on, this movie stands the test of time, and easily rewards repeat viewing.<br /><br />As to the Blu-ray: it looks gorgeous, but the upgrade is not as mind-boggling as was \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\". But that is perhaps not a fair comparison. All that aside, if you are \\"old school\\", you will love this again. For the younger generation: by all means, check this out, I think you will be more than pleasantly surprised. HIGLY RECOMMENDED!

B00DW1WR14|2.0|Starts off great! Solid Rockers. Then just starts getting Lamer and Lamer. This is not a Friday Night Rocker ready to rock the night. More of a Sunday morning hangover album. Long gone are the days when Pearl Jam were a real important band. Now they just sound way too laid back. Rock for old men type of music. And this is coming from a 45 year old man! If you're a fan of the early Pearl Jam days, stay away from this release. Disapointed :(
006202406X|4.0|CONTAINS SPOILERS!<br />I liked the book a lot. It was well paced. Of course, there were redundancies, like who cared if Mathhew had a supervisor or not, and Reggie was an unnecessary character. There are some holes in the story -- who produces all that wonderful food, where? Who makes the weapons for example? and BTW, did they or did they not have sex? But none of this is crucial to the story. What Roth accomplished is she gave us a deeper understanding of all of the characters. Tris is not perfect, she is super smart and very courageous with an enormous level of compassion and ability for forgive, and that's why we love her and that;s why her loss is so terribly painful, but she is still struggling with her feelings toward Caleb and her relationship with Tobias while trying to figure herself out. Tobias was a very strong and very powerful young man in the first book, but i felt that he was becoming more and more flawed since Insurgent, and even more so in this book. But at the same time, all of that is understandable, based on his upbringing and his choices. As Amar said, Tris was making him a better man. Now, how will he cope? Will he be able to find happiness? This is where I cannot even write any more bec. I get so upset. Really, for a YA book, we could've gotten a somewhat happier ending.  But I think the point is that someone like Tris would have to do something huge and everlasting, but at a great expense to herself  -- as Tobias thought, &#34;I suppose a fire that burns that bright is not meant to last.&#34; Which is true, unfortunately, and that is why the loss to everyone, the characters in the book and us as very invested readers, is so profound and so tragic and so perfect.

0385351399|5.0|THE CIRCLE made me nervous and made me laugh at the same time. Even though it's dystopian and futuristic, it's also very funny and very satiric.  The constant need to be \\"on\\", the loss of privacy, the need to have everyone know us and \\"like\\" us is already a disease in the world.  Find a non-passive aggressive way to give this book to all those people you know who spend way too much time on Facebook.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Let me start by saying that I have never written a review before, but I felt so strongly about Allegiant that I needed to get things off my chest. From the beginning I fell in love with the Divergent series and was excited to read the third installment. Honestly, it didn't live up to my expectations at all.<br /><br /> First of all, for me it didn't really start until about half way through the book. There was a lot of relationship stuff between Tobias and Tris throughout the first half and not much else. Also, where as the other two where action packed throughout the whole book I believe this one was lacking on that front.<br /><br /> Secondly, I love when I can read a book and get both main characters perspectives. But for Allegiant, it just didn't work for me. At times the chapter wasn't distinguishable enough for me to recognize whose point of view I was reading from. I would find myself having to go back to the beginning to make sure I was envisioning it from the right characters point of view. So Veronica Roth didn't really sale me on the alternating points of view for this.<br /><br /> Last, I felt like the characters were not as evolved in this third book. They had such great stories in the past two and with this one I feel like they were just kind of dull. I love Tris and Tobias as a couple but I feel like their relationship never really went anywhere. I wanted to see more of a deeper connection between them but the basis of their relationship in this book was them making out all the time. Also, with Tris and the relationship with her friends wasn't as involved as it was in the other series.<br /><br /> I'm not going to talk about the ending because I don't want to spoil the book for others but overall this book was severely lacking for me. The bar was set high from the first two in the series but Allegiant definitely fell short. It was a terrible end to what was one of my favorite series. I have gone from loving them to the point where I have decided to probably never read them again, to recommending them all the time to recanting that recommendation.<br /><br /> I believe Veronica Roth could have made this a much stronger and more well thought out book, and it could have been a great end to the series but ended up being none of those things for me.obably never read them again, to recommending them all the time to recanting that recommendation.<br /><br /> I believe Veronica Roth could have made this a much stronger and more well thought out book, and it could have been a great end to the series but ended up being none of those things for me.

1250030951|4.0|You will enjoy this book even if you're not a YA book fan. Twins Cather and Wren (yes, their names form \\"Catherine\\" for their mother expected one baby, not twins and couldn't be bothered coming up with another name; and yes, it's a little twee) are fans of a Harry Potteresque series of books about a character named Simon Snow. Such big fans, in fact, that Cather writes fan fiction wherein she imagines alternate plot lines and writes them for a site with many fans of her own. Excerpts of the \\"real\\" Simon Snow books as well as Cather's fan fiction alternate between chapters of the story, which is a cool plot device.<br /><br />When the twins go to college, Wren wants a life separate from Cather and proceeds to drink her way through college. Cather retreats into her fan fiction as she grapples with her moody roommate Reagan and Reagan's cute ex-boyfriend Levi as well as a literature class writing partner who is not what he seems.<br /><br />The twins have a manic dad back at home and a mom who abandoned them at a young age. The dialog is pretty funny but the story is overlong, taking too long to reach a conclusion - will Cather give up her fan fiction writing and apply her talents to real writing? Will Wren sober up? Will Reagan bond with Cather? Will Levi and Cather hook up? Will Dad get better? Will they forgive their Mom? Things plod along in an amiable way but ultimately wrap up in a predictable fashion.<br /><br />The author has a real talent for witty repartee though and for this, she deserves 4 stars.

B001GZ6QC4|3.0|The Dark Knight is a prime example how hype can take a movie and make it succeed beyond what they originally thought. First of all Heath Ledger pulls the Joker off really well, but Christian Bale's Batman is borderline silly with his over the to gravely voice, plus the film feels longer then it is, not to mention a little confusing. Some parts have good action, and they feel like a video game. But a good number of the movie is kinda dull, that's why this movie should have been called The Hype Knight, kinda reminds me of the story of the Emperor's New Clothes. Seriously The Joker is the best part, were as Two Face felt kinda unnecessary. They should have left him as Harvey Dent. Seriously Bolt was better then this, and i LOVE Bolt. Bolt had a better story as was much more fun, now that should have won best picture.<br /><br />If you wanna watch a good superhero movie from 2008, watch Iron Man!

B00BD99JMW|1.0|** SPOILER ALERT ** (I didn't give exact details, but it can be easily inferred)<br /><br />I feel let down by the poor portrayal of the alternate POV's (I was one of those that had a very hard time keeping up with which \\"head\\" I was in) and lack of originality vs. the first two books (it seemed like the same story told from a slightly different perspective), which made the end feel like it was written for \\"shock value\\" in order to make up for the ho-hum pace and absence of page-turning action throughout the rest of the book. I'm not saying that was intended, obviously I can only speculate what was in the authors mind. Regardless, that is the way it \\"felt\\" to this reader.<br /><br />Not only that, it felt so pointless... there wasn't anything revolutionary or thought-provoking that gave comfort and purpose to the pain you felt reading the end. One of my favorite movies is \\"Pay It Forward\\" which ends in the death of the main character, and a child at that. It even ends just when everything seems to be looking up for the little guy. It ripped my heart out, but it replaced that pain with hope, understanding, and \\"awe\\" at seeing just exactly how far-reaching the actions of that character were. Just writing about it now gives me chills.<br /><br />Allegiant was nothing at all like that. I don't feel like it would have taken much to show the effect and impact the sacrifice here had on the world, not just one character. I suppose I'm just as disappointed for all the possibilities and promise it had, but didn't take advantage of. I may have missed the author's point, but the author's point is lost without more definition for those who don't have those characters inside their head/heart and need a little more detail to \\"get them there.\\"<br /><br />Now, those going to the extreme of being just downright hateful are going way overboard for a book.  Death threats - take a deep breath and get a grip!  I'm also not going to be overly hasty and say I'll NEVER read one of her books again - never say never.  But, will it make me think twice about reading her material the next time? Absolutely. Will I go searching and make it a point to keep up with her future publications, salivating for the next one? Obviously not. ESPECIALLY for a newly emerging author. This isn't an author that I've been reading and loved so many of her books and she just had a \\"flop\\" in there. I'm not going to completely \\"write off\\" Veronica Roth, but I'm not going to be anxious for her either.again - never say never.

006202406X|2.0|Not much to say here that hasn't already been expressed by other disappointed readers but just to reiterate:<br /><br />1) The plot was so repetitive and just dragged on and on.  It goes something like this - nefarious  scheming, thwarted uprising, tragic death, Tris & Tobias fight and then make out.  Ugh.  I struggled to through the first half of the book then just skimmed the last 250 pages.<br /><br />2) Alternating POV = serious fail.  Before I realized they were supposed to be switching, I wondered why Tris was suddenly talking about herself in third person.<br /><br />3) The \\"shocking\\" ending.  Sure, do what you want since you've already killed off every other even minimally worthwhile character in the entire story.  Thanks for leaving us with a bunch of characters that I could care less about.  Yes it's a war and, in reality, war is horrible and people die, but would I really be reading YA dystopian fiction because I wanted a dose of reality? Just sayin'.<br /><br />After this disappointing ending, I had to reread Rae Carson's Bitter Kingdom just to reassure myself that well written and meaningful trilogies still do exist.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|It was not a bad book at all,which is why I gave it five stars. My problem with it was the ending. Throughout the Divergent series we fall in love with Tris and her relationship with Four. Then when she dies for no good reason, there are more chapters and  epilouge describing Tobias's pain and sorrow. Which made me cry. Tris endured so much in her life and did not deserve to die for no good reason. Veronica Roth killed her carrer by killing off a character who I became attached to as the other readers probably did. I will not read any more of her books because I dont want to get so attached to a character that gets killed for no reason. The author tried wayyyyyyyyy too hard to not make this final book like the Hunger Games series.

Picture quality is great. Only one episode had a glitch in it as far as viewing consistency. Delivery time was as promised and no issues in shipping. At the time, the price was an extraordinary fifty percent off what the retailers were asking. This makes an awesome gift or just a great addition to your collection.
B00EKQ3YZI|2.0|Upon first listen, I hated every track on this collection except the remix of \\"Love to Love You,\\" \\"Sunset People,\\" and \\"La Dolce Vida.\\"  (\\"Sunset People\\" is incredible; minimalist, a great use of Donna's vocals, and a joy to listen to.) Upon repeated listens, I have come to appreciate a few of the other tracks. \\"Bad Girls\\" and \\"Love Is In Control\\" are actually very well done, but there are a couple of real dogs here.  \\"Dim All The Lights\\" is pure crapp, from beginning to end!  For starters, this is not a REMIX of \\"Dim All The Lights\\" at all.  Instead, it is a new track with a scant sampling of Donna's vocals from the original recording.  The repetition of \\"dance your heart away\\" over and over and over again does not make this \\"Dim All The Lights.\\"  Absolutely anyone could have recorded that line over the track provided here.  The track is not a Donna Summer recording in any shape or form, and to call it one is sacrilege.  It is crapp, plain and simple.  The song, \\"Working The Midnight Shift,\\" is another odd one.  It is actually a very good song with a crisp clear mix, but the vocal on the track is not by Donna Summer.  Another vocalist is listed for \\"additional vocals\\" on the track.  It should say, instead, \\"Vocals by...\\"  Several of the remaining selections are okay to fairly good, but they are all so pointless.  These include the remixes of \\"Hot Stuff,\\" \\"Bad Girls,\\" and both versions of \\"I Feel Love.\\"  Oh... \\"On The Radio\\" is another real stinker where Donna Summer is a real afterthought, buried beneath the monotonous, overly loud music.<br /><br />The fact is that Donna Summer deserved better.  No one could get a person up and dancing better than Donna and her original recordings.  This remix collection was just unnecessary.  Why on earth put out this drudge as the first issue following her death?  Instead, why didn't her family, David Foster, and Verve put together a release of some of her unreleased recordings or tracks completed for her final, incomplete project?  Even a dance collection with sensible remixes, honoring the original melodies of Donna's songs, could have been a huge compliment to this great artist.  This collection is not!  DONNA DESERVES SO MUCH MORE!!!!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I think this book is the most charming book of the Selection Series I can' wait fir the next book!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|A great series of stories with unexpected or un-intuitive approaches to the world. Well written and organized, it was an easy read with tough subject matter at times, but made you shift perspective in unique and applicable ways.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Ok guys the only reason its not letting you log on is because that app is too old yall need to update it or get the new version in antother appstore. Simple
B001GMQALY|3.0|Kim basingers character was so annoying that it was difficult to watch.  I guess it was steamy for its time, but not so much now...
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This is a very cool technology.  You plug it into your TV and you can control the chromecast from your phone or computer to play netflix or hulu plus or youtube.  You can also show chrome webpages from your browser.<br /><br />The limimted # of apps makes the usefulness of this limited for me.  As they add apps it will be better.<br /><br />It is so cheap, so it is hard to regret the purchase, but it is more of a novelty than anything else at the moment.
B002M9WW30|4.0|I chose this rating because I like the Rocky series. The first one was my favorite but I still liked all the others...some more than others. I would recommend this series for those who love boxing.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Ok here's the thing. (some hints at spoilers if you're looking for them, but I'll try to be good)<br /><br />I hear the bad reviews and I get them. There were points that were tedious, there were elements that were discussed in far too much detail to be interesting, and there was very little further character development.<br /><br />I hear the good reviews, but most of them don't state why it was good, so I'll try my best.<br /><br />So here's how I feel.<br /><br />Yes, there were several lacking points of the book. Tris and Tobias, even towards the end, change very little from the people they came in as. It isn't until Tobias's life is torn apart that he really finds something new within himself. And Tris- I don't know that she ever does. The rest of the characters never change, and it is disappointing to watch. There are also elements brought in that make the book scientific and dragging at points. You as the reader are so concentrated on figuring out what Roth is saying that it can be difficult to stay invested in the story. For the new characters introduced- they are one sided, single minded people with the purpose of advancing the plot.<br /><br />I'm still trying to define the true reasoning for the end of the book being the way it was. Was it predictable? Probably. Was it alienating? A little. Were there better ways to get the point across? Most definitely. But the thing is that the important part was the message. More than anything, Roth wanted her readers to know that love is the answer. It is good to be brave, and the bravest thing you can do is to love- love with your entire self and never feel the need to hesitate with your heart. Also, look who she's writing for. Young adults need the message to stop fearing love, to open themselves up to their emotions, to find that bravery does not mean sacrificing yourself or the parts of you that people think are wrong. And she got the message across. It may have been a little cheesy and overdone, but it may have been exactly what her target audience needed.<br /><br />And I really feel the need to speak out to the love story. As someone who grew up in a very strict and regimented environment when it came to relationships, I can empathize with Tris and Tobias. And again, the message is simple and well played. It's not about abstinence. It's not about free love. It's about comfort with the person you're with- about what is right for both of you in that moment. It is about physical love coming out of something much deeper. One of the scenes I will never get out of my head is in Divergent when she sees his chest for the first time. The attraction, the fear, the desperate need to find a balance between the ideals being thrown at them is all so true. And so beautiful. And if this series can teach one person to find that balance and really take in the physical part of a relationship when it is right for them, then it has done its job. The way this relationship begins and the way it progresses is natural and understandable, and it grounds the idea of intimacy being intimate without making it into a set of rules or a command.<br /><br />I also am of the opinion that Roth is more talented than this book suggests. This one was rushed. Fans were clamoring for the ending so she wrote it and gave it to them. Yes, she should have taken her time- really read and understood and grounded her story. She rushed it for the public, a mistake I'm sure she will learn from in the future.<br /><br />The book was still interesting. I still read it in three days. I still was shocked and happy and sad, and the ending truly destroyed me when I first read it. Shock value or not- it was beautiful. And in many ways I feel it was right.<br /><br />If you're a fan of her books, don't leave them open ended. Finish the series and accept Allegiant with the grain of salt it deserves. I still personally look forward to things she will work on in the future.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|I chose this rating because I really liked this movie. It was entertaining, mind provoking and the ending was unexpected. It was fun to watch. I would recommend it highly.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Ciaran Hines is still the best Captain Wentworth. Some versions leave out too much or change the story. In this you can see the love growing again like a flower opening.
B00BAXFAOW|1.0|Really not up to scratch. The most informative part related to David and slingshots! Do  not bother to read this.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|This version was so much better than the old BBC version from 1972! Henry Tilney is supposed to be handsome. This is one of my less-liked Jane Austen stories, but well-done here.

B004XVMCMQ|5.0|It was maybe not quite true to the book, but true to its spirit.  Jonny Lee Miller is a favorite.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Once again, Gladwell has challenged our long held assumptions by offering new perspectives.  Why did David win against Goliath?  Why did those inexperienced young basketball players and their first time coach make it to the Nationals?  He teaches us to look outside the box and question the way we think things were or are.<br /><br />Good, provocative reading.
006202406X|2.0|I've found that my opinion of this book has gone down with time, so I'm editing this review....<br /><br />Summary: \\"Allegiant\\" wasn't entirely bad, but it was by far the weakest of the \\"Divergent\\" series, including the short stories.  There were parts that I liked, and at times, it had some of the same \\"I can't stop reading\\" feel that the other books had, but overall it felt very disconnected from the first two books.  The characterizations and voices were different, and the plot had virtually no overlap with the earlier books.  In many ways, the book felt like it had been written by a different author, enough so that at one point I went online to double-check that I had received the right book.<br /><br />On top of that, the book left me with a tremendous feeling of loss that left me unwilling to ever read it again.  Originally, I thought I would get over that and reread at least some parts of it, but I never did.  Instead, my uncertainty turned to dislike, and I eventually removed the book from my Kindle so I wouldn't have to see it when browsing my library.  Even worse, the book also turned me off the first two books in the series for a while.  I don't think I would have gotten over that if it weren't for fanfiction, but fortunately, that restored the rest of the series for me.  Still, I would have to say that on balance, I wish I had never read \\"Allegiant.\\"  It just didn't give me enough to make up for what it took away.<br /><br />At this point, my honest recommendation is to read \\"Divergent\\" and \\"Insurgent\\" and then skip to fanfiction.  There are several alternate third books out there that will give you closure on the series, including one I wrote called \\"Determinant\\" (if you're interested in trying it, search on \\"Windchimed Determinant\\").  There are also hundreds of alternate endings that assume the first part of \\"Allegiant\\" occurred but then pick up partway through that book and provide a happier ending.  If you've already read \\"Allegiant\\" and want to forget it, those endings will help you do that.<br /><br />For those of you who are still undecided, here's a summary of what works and what doesn't in \\"Allegiant\\"....<br /><br />What works:<br /><br />1. You learn more about Tris' mother.  It's a little strange and contradicts the earlier books, but it's there.<br /><br />2. You find out what happened to some characters who were mentioned earlier but not shown.<br /><br />3. You get the story on the world around Chicago, why they're there, and how they came to be.  Unfortunately, it's dull and contradicts the earlier books, but it does offer a type of closure.<br /><br />4. There are some decent scenes.<br /><br />5. It explores concepts you don't often see in YA books -- remorse, change, death, healing, and everyday forms of courage.  In particular, though the end is crushingly sad, you realize that some of the characters improved each others' lives permanently and changed the world around them for the better, and that this effect doesn't go away when they die.  Basically, their lives and relationships were worthwhile, even if much too short.<br /><br />What doesn't work:<br /><br />1. The book lacks emotion.  \\"Divergent\\" and \\"Insurgent\\" have a lot of feeling, both stated and implied.  There are many scenes in those books that I re-read repeatedly, just savoring the feel of them.  This book has very, very little of that, and what it does have isn't as good.  The only feeling that's deep is grief, which is overwhelming at the end, but honestly, most of that grief is because you love the characters from how they were in the earlier books, not for what you saw in this book.<br /><br />2. The narration never finds its groove and doesn't sound like it did in the earlier stories.  Tris's sentence structure is suddenly short, with no \\"poetry\\" to the words, and Tobias/Four doesn't sound at all like he did in the short stories.  Also, they sound so much like each other that I kept forgetting whose POV I was reading.<br /><br />3. Most of the other characters disappear or die without any further development.  They have very few lines, and some of them (including some important ones) literally die without ever speaking a new word.<br /><br />4. The whole faction concept, with all of its interesting elements, basically just goes away.<br /><br />5. There's startlingly little consistency with the earlier books.  Personally, I thought there were subtle clues in the first two books about the characters and about what plot developments were coming, and I expected to see Roth pick up on those the way JK Rowling always did, but absolutely none of them came back that way.  As an example, Tori got through Jeanine's defenses, implying she was Divergent, yet we saw her kill an Abnegation leader during the simulation, implying she wasn't.  I thought we'd learn more about her, but there's nothing.  I expected some big reveals about Caleb and Peter, but those didn't happen either.  Uriah, one of the more interesting side characters, says almost nothing.  The same goes with Evelyn, and the relationship between her and Natalie Prior, and Marcus, and really all of them -- those clues are all left as loose strings.<br /><br />6. The plot is simplistic, inconsistent with the earlier books, and full of holes.  The earlier books had a lot of action and unexpected twists and turns.  This one doesn't.<br /><br />* Warning: The rest of this review contains major spoilers. *<br /><br />To me, the biggest disappointment with Tris wasn't her death.  That was actually the most in-character part of the book.  What frustrated me was how she got there.  She found out that people were going to wipe memories, and she immediately planned to wipe their memories instead, without even trying to think of any other solutions.  Why didn't she offer to go into the city and fix things another way to avoid the need for the reset, the way her mother did years earlier?  Why didn't she at least try to use her influence on David to gethim to see another perspective?  For that matter, she could have kidnapped David and taken him into the city to keep the rest of the Bureau from attacking, or she could have used the memory wipe serum directly on him to get him to forget about the plan.<br /><br />Instead, she jumped straight to the idea of setting off the serum en masse.  And then, after she decided that, she apparently could only think of one way to get it.  She didn't try to figure out the passcode, even though Tobias is great with computers and even though David was obsessed with her mother and might have used her name as a passcode.  She didn't consider attacking the group that was taking the serum to the plane to try to release the serum by shooting the container it was in.  She didn't seem to make any effort at all.  Instead, she just stated that it was a suicide mission and let her brother agree to die for it.  It was so glaringly out of character that I assumed Roth was going to have a bunch of other things happen to change this course of action, but she didn't.<br /><br />Also, I can't help but feel like this entire book was an attack on Tobias.  He had almost nothing good in his very dark life, and this book took away what little he had.  He lost his Divergence, and he lost Tris, and for a while he lost Zeke's friendship.  I suppose the point was to show that life is still worth living no matter what, but it really felt like heaping even more punishment on top of someone who didn't deserve it.  There was no sense of justice to it at all, and that's a horrible feeling to walk away with at the end of a trilogy.  I think that's the biggest reason this book \\"sat\\" so poorly for me.  Injustice always does.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I love how un-touchy feely this book is. As a life long musician and writer, I relate to the struggles. It's a break to hear it all put down so brazenly. The King Kong story is worth the price. I have a note to self: \\"Marines love misery.\\"

B00BD99JMW|4.0|I wasn't attached to this book like I was when the first two came out, but I think that is just because of the point of view changing back and forth.

Check your player's compatibility first, or just buy the DVD (or read the book - it is truly beautiful!)  I'll bet the movie's beautiful too, but I won't know until I either buy a new Blu Ray player, or buy this in DVD.

B007REV4YI|5.0|While the second film in the Daniel Craig era of Bond (Quantum of Solace) was less well received than the first (Casino Royale), Skyfall is an epic ending to the trio, which completes the total reboot of the Bond series.  It does seem, however, to leave the door wide open for the next film to have a new actor playing Bond.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|I would most recommend this for those who know basic grammar and spelling. Those entirely new will learn very little and will have a hard time going through the lessons. Regardless, this app is helpful. It shows meanings and you may hear the pronunciation. It would be helpful to read or learn more about the words themselves before actually quizzing but, that seems all that is needed. Basically, the beginners should study up and definitely come back for this! Very recommended!
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|This is a super documentary that includes interviews with some of rock music's greatest talents.  It also includes some great old music.  If you are interested in rock music from the 60's to the 80's, don't miss it.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|It was hard trying to the find the tough Tobias that we all knew from the previous books, and the Tobias that is portrayed in this book. i dont regret knowing that they are tons of layers underneath his mask that he has in place. I wish that Roth could have been able to create some sort of character differences between them. There were times when i would forget and realized that is is either Tobias' chapter or Tris'. I dont disagree with Roth for kill off Tris it would have been nice to see what the future would have been like for her ad Tobias, but this gave the book the emotional drive that the series needed instead of violence, and structure.

B0026772N8|1.0|I was anticipating that I would really like this book given all of the reviews and things I had heard about it. I only made it through the first six chapters before turning it off (kindle version). I found it overrated.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I adored the first two books, and of course I loved Darcy, but this third one really outlived my expectations because it was just so darned brave..and funny..as someone who has gotten older along with Bridget, and survived my share of hard knocks, I found this to be that much more hopeful and endearing - while still being riotously funny and messy and real.<br /><br />Bridget is resilient. She carries on.  Sometimes just barely (and it's a relief to find out, as the story goes on, that's true for more than one character who appears on the outside to be doing just perfect) but she's completely Bridget.  She's still optimistic and funny and hopeful and generous - and she leaves you rejoicing in all those things.

1401235425|5.0|I hate the whole concept of The New 52 universe; an across the board reboot of DC continuity that has all the trappings of a profit grab.  Even someone like me...a primarily Marvel guy with an above average knowledge of most of the DCU...someone who would benefit greatly from such a reboot, I was less than impressed. There were some gems (Teen Titans, Birds of Prey) but if I had to pick the crown jewel it would this title.  While Scott Snyder's dialogue is not quite on par with many of his peers, his plotting, pace, and action scenes employed in this title are some of the best in comics today.  When paired with Greg Capullo's McFarlane-esque visuals the complete package is hard to put down.<br /><br />While many of The New 52 launches kept plots that were fairly close to the origins, Batman's reboot strikes out for bolder ground and for that I applaud it.  Since I've been reading Batman Gotham City has been made into a character all its own.  Batman's love for it and interaction with it has been the centerpiece of many a Batman tale.  Snyder asks the simple question...what if Gotham City had secrets of her own? What if within its shadows is something far more terrifying, far more powerful, than Batman or the many costumed villains he faces? And what if this evil was waiting in the dark, watching Batman as he thought he was watching over the city?<br /><br />Snyder answers these questions with a secret order, an illuminati of sorts that has been part of Gotham since its inception.  Featured in urband legend much the same way Batman was, it is so ingrained in Gotham's DNA that it is found in nursey rhymes and old wives tales.  But as Batman is to learn, the sociey is very real, very far reaching, and very determined to reclaim Gotham and do away with the Bat.<br /><br />At times Snyder's telling reads like a police procedural, while at others if feels like a ghost story.  The Batman of this story is every bit a detective as he is a warrior.  He uses brain and braun in equal measure as he stubbornly pulls at the threads of Gotham's vast historical tapestry, unraveling the mystery bit by bit, until the conspiracy of the Court of Owls is revealed.  While this may sound like standard fare, in the hands of Snyder it is something completely different.  In his highly capable hands you feel you are right there with Batman, you feel the pull of the mystery, the shocking revelation, and in one truly brillaint scene you feel yourself plunging into madness.<br /><br />A book that succeeds in involving the reader to that extent is worth owning.<br /><br />A word about the negative reviews....<br /><br />The most well written review in the 1 star column seems to be less of a fan of the DCU as I am.  Since...at least...Frank Miller's take on the Dark Knight he has been an overly flawed character.  A character who, at times, becomes so obsessed with the goal that he becomes a base representation of Batman the guardian, detective, father figure, etc.  What Snyder did to Batman is the result of a two decade long  erosion from the ideal presented in that review to the Batman he is today.  Longing for the character representations from the 1930's and wishing the Batman in The New 52 was more caring and in touch with his motions is terribly unrealistic.equal measure as he stubbornly pulls at the threads of Gotham's vast historical tapestry, unraveling the mystery bit by bit, until the conspiracy of the Court of Owls is revealed.

B00DXP7L88|1.0|***SPOILERS***<br /><br />Incredibly disappointing. I have followed Dexter from Season 1, and have largely been a huge fan of the show. The writing, particularly in the early seasons, was incredible. It was well-executed, highly psychological, and exciting. The show, simply speaking, was 'on', firing on all cylinders. While many have perceived the later seasons as reflecting a decline in terms of direction, writing, excitement, etc., I maintained my appreciation of the show as a whole for many reasons. I also appreciated the development of the characters, the plot lines, and what could have been presented as a satisfying ending to a great show. While I didn't necessarily agree with various choices made (elements of Seasons 5 and 6 come to mind), I understood and accepted the underlying thinking. Season 8, in essence, ran the series into the ground.<br /><br />The writing, overall, for the end of the series comes across as though it was written on a whim, lacking in both thought and direction. This is particularly confusing and curious, considering the essence of the end of the show (in terms of plot) was decided upon as early as two to three years ago, which would seem to suggest that they had more than enough time to plan it out. The show, in the end, felt tired, unimaginative, and illogical. There were many, many gaping plot holes - too many to list. There was considerable oversight. It was not as sharp as it once was - a failure for a show that seemed to pride itself, rightfully so, on its exacting intricacy.<br /><br />The writers pass through a series of personal voyages for all characters that, for the most part, show considerable promise early on. Despite some interesting directions (with Masuka, for instance), in the end, these storylines seem to serve as nothing more than distractions and fillers dangled in front of the viewer. They're dropped, with the excuse given by producers that the show, in the end, centered on Dexter. This, perhaps, would have been acceptable if the show closed Dexter's character in any kind of fitting manner.<br /><br />The finale is exhaustingly illogical and incoherent. Ultimately, it comes across as a closing to a series (or multitude) of disparate plot lines the writers and producers didn't have the ability to effectively manage; they opened up too many doors for which they had neither the ability nor the apparent desire to close appropriately. Worse than this, the writing in the finale is tedious and, some would say, insulting. It is contradictory, self-confirming, and is antithetical to much of the work that was done in building and developing Dexter and Deb as characters. In other words, it seemed like a moral bait-and-switch. The writers towed a moral line through much of the close of the series, examining Dexter's ability (or relative inability) to develop as a person, exhibit and experience humanity and humility, approach some type of normalcy with regard to morality, etc. The end did nothing to bring this to a reasonable  and fitting close. If we are to reasonably believe that the imposition of a type of self-inflicted prison is the most feasible way of giving Dexter what he 'deserves', the writing did very little to support or provide a foundation for that over the last season. The degrading of Deb's character can be couched in terms of analogy to the development of Dexter's. Both are products (victims?) of circumstances. Both deal with the cards that they're dealt with - with sincere and, I would say, moral intentions. Admittedly, attributing fault and following the trail of moral cause and influence of Dexter's and Deb's mutual destruction seems a difficult task; however, the writers didn't even begin to do the topic justice. The notion that Deb is to come to the end that she did and that Dexter is to feel the full weight of it all in the way that he did is laughable. It lacks in any type of moral consistency.<br /><br />It isn't that I have an issue with the decision to kill Deb. I personally would never have conceived of such an ending as being fitting, but I don't base my opinions on that decision. Rather, I base my disappointment on the way in which it was executed - poorly. The treatment of Deb's end (and the show's end) was superficial and absent-minded. The writing, to this end, was also superficial. Any thought or symbolism behind this writing is imagined. Calling a spur-of-the-moment hurricane 'Laura' (Dexter's mother) to present Dexter's origins as a basis for where and how he 'needed' to end; Deb wrapped in white, pure and 'buried' by her brother; Dexter imprisoning himself in Oregon (Dexter, Oregon perhaps?) to impose 'deserved' punishment on himself for his 'destruction' of Deb; etc., etc. - these present the illusion of thought, but are considerably below-the-mark compared with the writing of earlier seasons. Worse, they lack in cohesion.<br /><br />The handling of Dexter's end could not have been more baseless and weak. The potential existed for real strength in what could have been done with Dexter. Conceivably, either killing him off or, conversely, developing him to the point of a 'reformed' (albeit in Dexter's own way), morally-operating individual would have been orders of magnitude more compelling than what was given. What was given was a cop-out - something that allowed the show to drag on without an actual ending and without certainty. Something that still continues to allow the show to drag on aimlessly and mindlessly if you're wont to believe spin-off rumors. In short, the writers had perhaps two choices to make - option one and option two - in dealing with Dexter as a character; two choices that could have been very strong. They chose option three - a lazy and uninspired choice.<br /><br />The producers have since attempted to explain (and defend) their decisions, couching their choices in terms of what they felt was most fitting in ensuring that Dexter felt the full weight of his actions. This, simply speaking, isnonsense. Anyone who claims such writing and direction as having thought, execution, and any type of cohesion is deluded. Anyone who claims that the result of Dexter's character was the only necessary option to ensure that he 'got what he deserved' is also deluded. This is, purely and simply, lazy and unintelligent writing - a vague attempt at what was thought as deep, reflective, and morally-conscious writing. An attempt to finish what was created by those with considerably better ability to manage such a show.<br /><br />Overall, the end lacked considerably in what made Dexter such an engaging show early on. The writing seemed tired, incoherent, and illogical. The direction (or lack thereof) of the final season ran what had considerable promise as a stellar ending to a great series into the ground. Instead, the finale flirted with morality in a way that was absurd, explored erroneous plot lines that insulted viewers' intelligence, and gave an ending that ran counter to what had been developed for the show. A large failure.

It is not what you think it might be, but something else. I found it hard for the people to go on and not try to rectify what happened. There needed to be some atonement. So, I was disappointed in the ending

B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I had heard that I shouldn't expect much of a plot line, but I should expect a good action movie.  I actually really liked the movie.  It reminded me somewhat of a gundam-style anime.  I still think Japan could have made a better movie, but it's a good start toward making a realistic movie with this kind of story-line.  It was definitely more than a good action movie.  I liked the different approach to alien invasion.  I also liked that the movie wasn't full of A-list stars; it allowed the movie to have it's own character and I could appreciate the details.
B005HED08I|5.0|This was an truly entertaining look at the beginning of Star Trek and the added commentary by Gene Roddenberry made this show a must see for Star Trek fans.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Considering that the TV/movie industry has exhausted just about every potential source of a zombie apocalypse, this was still an interesting approach to the nature of a &#34;zombie virus&#34;.  The plot was somewhat predictable, and a little unbelievable at times.  It's definitely a suspenseful movie, but if you're looking for something more, it will probably disappoint you.

B000JMKQX0|3.0|So I think it started out great, there was a lot going on and a lot of touching personal accounts, a lot of tragedy, overall terrifying. The problem for me was half way though I realized that it was just memoir of different peoples accounts throughout the epidemic from beginning to end. I wouldn't have minded this if the author would have allowed us to stay with some key people throughout their entire story. Unfortunately, we never get to go back and find out what happened with some of the story tellers and this is where I lost interest. It's majorly comprised of solider/ military/leadership accounts which tend to be a little crass and negative. I would've enjoyed this book more if there were some &#34;happy&#34; endings and a little closure.
006202406X|1.0|Contains spoilers!!<br />I'm so sorry that this series ended the way it did. Unlike many reviewers I don't think this was a rushed decision on Mrs. Roth's part, she states in many interviews she knew how she wanted it to end from the very beginning. I also don't think she did it to be purposely cruel. I think she sees the ending as expressing her personal beliefs as a Christian very well. I also think she seems like a very sweet woman and just because of that I wish I could write a more forgiving review.<br /><br />Instead, having read the book while my daughter did the same, all I can express is utter disappointment. Within the first two books I really saw the character of Tris as a flawed but overall excellent role model, certainly leaps and bounds better than Bella would ever be. I loved that my daughter so connected to this strong and brave character. I actually especially loved that self sacrifice is explored as something that is not always ideal.<br /><br />Looking at this series from a secular feminist perspective I loved that in books 1 and 2 here was an example showing girls that sacrificing all of yourself is not usually the best/right answer. It's pretty much the exact opposite to Bella of Twilight who sacrifices her life for her boyfriend and has rightly been condemned as a weak character. Women in our society constantly hear messages of how we must sacrifice and put ourselves last, to our own detriment since the same is not asked of men.  Finally we had a character and book dealing with this issue in a positive way, all the way until her death. By having her death be her sacrificing herself for her brother everything was basically undone and all character growth was removed. Yes, Mrs. Roth tried to make it all about motivation but the end result was the same, Tris was the same as before she left Abnegation. Had Caleb actually died and willingly sacrificed himself that would have at least shown some character growth for him, though not the level of growth that Tris had experienced. Even had events been the same but Tris had lived the story would have had a much better feel since Tris did believe she had a chance against the Death Serum and was not just throwing her life away originally.  Tris's death truly ruined the end of the series and my one hope is that it is re-written in the movie adaptation. As a parent I find it important for YA novels to end with a sense of hope. Even in The Fault in Our Stars with one character dead and the knowledge that the other is living on borrowed time there was a feeling of hope and meaning. I think Mrs. Roth went for that ending but is to much of a young and inexperienced writer to achieve it yet.<br /><br />I'd like to say I will support Mrs. Roth's future endeavors but right now that seems unlikely. Unless I hear some amazing reviews of her future work we will be staying away.
B009IQG5M4|5.0|I was very happy to find the Joy Luck Club in the DVD listings.  It is a great favorite of mine and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a dramatic, family tale of a long journey home.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|The Racketeer was a really great read. Fast paced, easy to read but with a great plot. Very enjoyable. I would highly recommend it. John Grisham never lets you down

B002PLDSX8|5.0|After watching up to the current season ( season 5 ), I am so incredibly addicted to this series. The actors are amazing, the plot has many unexpected twists and turns, and I feel myself almost personally in the story. I am writing this review under season 1 because I highly recommend everyone watch this incredible series!!!
006202406X|5.0|I think there's a lot of immediate reaction and not enough analysis going in the review section, so I feel compelled to contribute to the OTHER side of the coin.<br /><br />I feel perfectly comfortable saying I loved Allegiant. I thought it was moving and a very powerful exposition of what's bravery and sacrifice, about moving on, about carrying on and re-building even with the heavy baggage of life, about how people have the ability to make a lasting impact, on a bigger societal scale but also on more a intimate level, as people. The book spoke to me. I'm sure it did the same for other people. Was it perfect? No. I don't think any book is, though, and it hasn't stopped me from loving them before. Seeing how much \\"hate\\" and criticism this book is getting from a very vocal portion of the fan base (and, let's be honest, mostly based off a controversial plot choice by the author) makes me want to dismiss my own issues with the book as minor pet peeves. There was a LOT of information to process --plot lines and overlapping themes-- but I think Veronica Roth managed to stay true to the voice of her characters and to the reality of the world she created. In fact, Allegiant may even be thematically stronger than Insurgent. 1-star reviews? Whaaat. Not even Breaking Dawn! (Well, maybe Breaking Dawn. <--- aaand that was a joke.)<br /><br />So readers, my recommendation is (1) to give Allegiant a FAIR chance and (2) to not rush through your reading.<br /><br />As a reader (I finished last night), I'm satisfied. I'm still pensive and with a heavy-heart. Except I think that's a good thing. Bottom line: everyone is entitled to their own interpretation of the book. It is OK if I saw it that way and others didn't. The point is that everyone SHOULD make that call for themselves, and that simply cannot happen without reading the book first. Do not let other readers create an opinion for you. Do not let other readers deter you from what should be YOUR experience.

B00881VLCE|3.0|wht bothers me is that there is no way to keep the puzzle from movig as you attach the pieces. very annoyung
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|I loved the 3rd book in the series. I didn't want it to end. Atwood has a multi-tiered creative brain and tells multiple stories within one. I love how she moves through time and perspectives so fearlessly. She is a one of a kind writer. Truly unique. Poetic. Solid.
B0014VQGX4|4.0|Nice toy for the money. He carries it to day care and up and down the stairs and inside and outside and it's still all in one piece!
006202406X|1.0|My disappointment in this book has more to do with the poor choice of ending. This book was so poorly developed and had a feeling of being completely rushed. I have enjoyed reading different POVs in the past but Veronica Roth completely loses her character development in this third installment. I frequently forgot who was narrating the chapter as both characters have identical inner thoughts and reactions. Both personalities were so watered down and lacked the strength, power and fascinating qualities that drew me to the books and allowed me to overlook some less than stellar writing.<br /><br />I also don't understand why she chose to take the plot in the direction she did. I feel like she was making the books up as she wrote without a clear ending in mind, except for the fact that she wanted to kill her protagonist. At the end of this book, being divergent really didn't mean anything... Which nullifies the series with this title. Stating that the video at the end of insurgent was simply hype in order to lead the community outside the gate (into essentially nothing...) seemed as if Roth had written herself into a corner that she couldn't get out of. The book simply has a feel of being rushed, as if the author was out of creative ideas and sick of the series. Having a power hungry villain change her mind because her son said \\"please\\" is absurd... I feel that the potential for an explosive, action packed conclusion was simply dropped for a cop out ending.<br /><br />Choosing to kill the protagonist without meaning was a way to lose the trust and adoration of her fans. Many YA authors have killed influential characters in a way that was heartbreaking yet supported the story. While I do understand the ending was meant to be somewhat \\"realistic\\" (in a completely unrealistic novel with no true scientific/genetic research inserted), most YA readers enjoy their novels as an escape from reality and a breath of hope in times of intense struggle. There was nothing gained by her loss, and if she had to die, it shouldn't have been at the hands of an unworthy, undeveloped, basically unknown character. The ending feels like a breech of trust and was cheaply done. It seems that killing the main character was the only vision the author had for her conclusion, completely throwing plot to the wind. I have no desire to see the movies and am returning my kindle edition. I truly wish I had never read this final installment
006202406X|5.0|I know a lot of people are upset with the ending of this book. But The author clearly did it for a reason. As much as we dislike it, it's life and it's what happens. The character went down heroically, and overall, the book is worth reading.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was a great book - couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I went back to read the shining, and I think this book is much better.  I Highly recommend.

B009ZXT4BY|2.0|This is a stupid app! Sure it's free and all, but it's the demo version! The real app is $2.99 . Although, I got it, and its pretty sweet! I built a huge barn, and I have orcas!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really like the glad to finally have it available on the Kindle Fire. don't care for the time limit on lives but that has a positive side as well.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is an enjoyable game that is very simple.  This is not going to work your brain at all, but it's fun to play around with brains and shotguns.  Easy, simple, and very little strategy, this game is intended for low focus and fun times.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I would've given it 5 stars but I don't like that when you have a repeating event you can't just delete one day if things change, it only deletes the whole repeating event. They need to add the option to &#34;delete only this event&#34; Oh, and some more different icons would be nice too.<br />It's great that they have them, at all, it makes it easier to keep track of things like birthdays. This is the only calendar that I found that had that and that I can have the time in 12hr mode, not 24hr mode like a lot of them have.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|This 1960's (!) made for TV Sci-Fi series has a timeless appeal. Even after all these years it is still relevant and entertaining. While not a 'Trekkie' as such, I must admit I've seen every episode more than once.  TV is hard enough to watch these days as it is, but when I get a little spare time this program is definitely my 'go to'. Beam me up Scotty!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a must have. You are reminded of Christ's words everyday which will help in our spiritual growth. Heaven is our goal, so the holy Bible is where we get our nourishments and spiritual values.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!  It's so much fun and addictive. Some levels can be very challenging.  I've been playing this game on my phone for a while and was so happy to see it available to play on my Kindle!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm delighted!<br /><br /> I'm hooked on candy crush and spend hours relaxing to the game. This takes me away after a long day in class &amp; work.
B0052RE4MQ|1.0|Matched left me thinking things were going to really get going in this book, but while reading Crossed, I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen. It just never did. I was pretty disappointed. I really hate to say that, but it didn't keep my attention. There was a lot of traveling, a lot of mental monologues, and a lot of poetry, but not much else.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great series! The storyline is very engaging. The casting is great. The setting, scenery and costumes are fabulous. Looking forward to the next season!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I liked the book way better than the show. It captured a lifestyle that is hard to relate to as a student and I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Thank goodness Jeffrey Archer has been unable to conclude his Clifton series in the three novels he has first planned.  This means more great reading for his fans.
B0011XBLV2|5.0|I love it! One of the best Westerns! One of Clint Eastwood's best movies! A must have in the Western Collection Movies.
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|I really enjoyed khaleds previous two books so I expected to enjoy this sadly it did not live up to my expectations.. The general idea of the lost child Parsi was interesting but it became ensnared into a poorly woven story culminating in a really disappointing reunion. I still read it hoping it would come together but I felt it introduced too many characters eg the doctor, the child of the warlord,  not really related to the story which I found hard to follow. .I  hate to be negative but feel it would have been better to concentrate on  Parsi and Abdullas life and how being torn apart affected them
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|This is a very clever and unique game in my opinion.  Sometimes it can be a little challenging but overall fun.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is so romantic and lovely in its' presentation, that I almost swooned.  (Not really) But it was very, very good.  We all know the story of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen and I have three movie versions, but this is my favorite.  Colin Firth is excellent as the very arrogant Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle plays the role of Elizabeth Bennet, just perfectly.  I highly recommend this movie version of Pride and Prejudice to everyone.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Just wish it was a little harder. Nice graphics and cool upgrades. What else can I say except get it while  it's free.

B0033H7VI6|3.0|Like the look, the feel, the weight. This is ALOT of knife. Its solid. Out of the package, leg stap lame, but when they market a knife with a low price they start cutting corners on the sheath, which was expected but this sheath looked better than most affordable blades come with. I will definately replace the leg tie. the pouch is roomy enough to fit a big fire starter, a small diamond sharpener (dont buy the SOG SHO-CP its crap) and a small baggie with water purification pills. The blade almost needs to be sharpened right away, and as for stones, dont get one until you have the knife, the curved blade is nice but will take some getting used to as far as sharpening. The snap that holds the handle broke after unsnapping it in my house about 6-7 times. I'll post more after i attack the desert with it this weekend.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have played this on Facebook on my computer for quite some time.  It is so much more interactive on the Kindle Tablet as you use your fingers to make the moves with the candy. Much more fun actually!

B008FPOIT6|1.0|I picked this book because of its rating and because I was looking to read a good fiction book.<br /><br />The writing style of the author is mediocre and makes it difficult to be fully immersed in the story.<br />Personally, I did not find the plot that sophisticated, but with the same plot it could have been a much better book.<br /><br />If you are a developer for the web or a tech with profound technological knowledge, you will find some of the information in the book just annoying and the resistance to go forward int he reading will be harder for you.<br /><br />Save your money and pass on.

A great source for anyone looking to reacquaint themselves with the sport.<br /><br />It's already made a huge impact on my workout routine; folks in the gym are also commenting how my intensity has gone up.

B005QYKD4I|4.0|Dark of the Moon was much better than the 2nd flop Revenge of the Fallen. I had my doubts but the movie kept my attention almost throughout the entire film. It only dragged towards the end during the big fight scene.  It did not have to be that long, but that's what you want in a Transformer movie - a huge fight scene. I loved that it was in Chicago though as it's my home town, great shots of destruction downtown.<br /><br />Great Friday/Saturday night popcorn flick, cook some frozen pizza and drink some wine and beer and enjoy.
B00BKTFABE|5.0|This is awesome! I wish I could silence the click so I could take pictures w/out people knowing all the time! I like having pictures of my family on the tablet to look through. Plus, it takes quite a large picture with great clarity!
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Great CD, most every song could be a hit.  This groug has been great since early on in their careers.
