B000067CPX|5.0|From the opening track, BY THE WAY, to the hauntingly melodies of VENICE QUEEN, the Chili Peppers continue their musical evolution with even more eclectic cutting edge tunes.  Simply put, this is a great album from a band that only seems to get better and tighter as the years go by.  <br />Building on the success and ambiance of Californication, By the Way is another notch in the increasing belt of the peppers. Check out the Zephyr Song, Throw Away Your Television especially.  <br />The whole album is great and looks to debut at #1.
B000002GJH|2.0|Though the joining of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden had its pleasant moments on this record, this is mostly B-side material.  Chris Cornell can't hold a candle to the new-kid-on-the-block, Chad Kroeger of Nickelback, or the guy from Staind.  While Cornell writes very self-involved lyrics, Kroeger writes in a more universal manner, thereby letting everyone into his world.  Cornell's world is only drugs, grunge, and Seattle cafes.<br />Ed Vedder sort of picks the record up with his vocal contribution on \\"Hunger Strike,\\" but it's not enough to save this complete wreck of an album.  Heck, this stuff wasn't even too hip in the early 90's, so why would it be any good now?<br />For true grunge check out Creed, Bush, Staind, Default and of course, the legendary Nickelback.<br />Well, I hope this helped you in your selection process.
0802130208|4.0|One thing must be made perfectly clear from the start -- this is an extremely fun book to read. It's funny, it's paced well; it's a terrific summer read. That said, however, I don't think this is quite the Great American Novel the critics have declared it to be. My suspicion is that many of them are more excited about HOW it came to be than WHAT it came to be. Just as music critics dream of breaking some obscure-but-magical band they just happened to hear in a small-town bar, this work -- written by a talented-but-troubled young man, forgotten for years after his suicide, discovered by his mother is some musty cabinet, dropped on the desk of a skeptical English professor, begrudgingly read, then found to be a masterpiece -- proved too tempting; it's TOO perfect. So go into this knowing that the book's legacy probably has as much to with its lavish praise as its content.<br />I found the book to be a bit like a kiddie pool -- colorful, fun, inviting, but, while broad enough to hold many characters, ultimately very shallow. Certainly, many of the characters were given magnificent, hilarious dialogue (although Burma's constant \\"Hey!\\"s and \\"Whoa!\\"s baffled me; was he being shot at, did he have Tourette's?), but they weren't given much life; we never got to know them. Miss Trixie, Lana Lee and Mrs. Levy, for instance, were given a hook line and esentially repeated it ad nauseum for the rest of the novel. And once the roster was divided into good guys and bad guys, the book marched on to a fairly predictable end.<br />Even our enormous, over-educated, cripplingly neurotic, eternally belching anti-hero Ignatius was ultimately little more than a vehicle for Toole's amazing monologues. While we were given tiny glimpses of his humanity, an awful high school experience, his heartbreak over his departed dog, his secret love for the movies, we never learned what made him tick. WHY was he so rabidly averse to sex, obsessed with pre-Renaisannce history, undermotivated and fearful?What in his childhood or college experience molded him, changed him?<br />That said, though, the book IS pretty darned funny and has some of the most twisted twists ever. Ignatius' near-success in organizing a full-blown religious crusade with a pack of bemused, semi-literate factory workers had me rolling, and his, er... unique plan to inflitrate the armed forces to bring about a new era of world peace had to be one of the most hilariously fiendish concepts in recent memory -- it seemed as though it actually MIGHT work. All of the character plots tied together beautifully and, although their eventual outcomes are fairly obvious, the roads which led them there are anything but.<br />So know that this is not one of the greats, nor is there a Big Message, other than that desperate self-preservation will generally triumph over either secular humanism or staunch religious morality. Know also, though, that you will have a heck of a good time reading this. Perhaps not a leather-bound tome to be positioned among the classics in a college library, but a great addition to the pile of paperbacks in your rented beach house.
B000002J03|2.0|Hey, is this freedom rock?  WELL TURN IT DOWN!!<br />With a wailing lead singer, a guitar player who tries to cram too many notes in one measure, and a drummer who can't keep time to save his life, this ain't classic rock...it's freedom rock gone bad. <br />For real metal, check out Korn 'n Bizkit.<br />Later!!
B00005Q4ED|2.0|I was thrilled to find the George C. Scott/Susannah York version of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; released on DVD.  The VHS version was perfect so I expected the DVD to be just as spectacular, if not better.<BR>I was terribly disappointed to find first that the picture quality showed it was obviously transferred from a worn film print and then horrified to find scenes actually chopped to bits!<BR>This DVD will be going in the give-away pile, unfortunately.<BR>In the meantime I'm hanging on to my VHS copy until someone who<BR>knows what they're doing puts a decent copy to DVD!
B00003CXE7|5.0|What can i say? I think that this has to be the definitive movie of the decade. It has everything - a great director behind the helm, an oscar-winning actor, a phenomenal script and a character like non-other.<br />Ridley Scott has created a vision that is in my own humble opinion, the best look into the such a great era. His research and details have indeed given us a feel of what it is to be living in that time. He makes us forget the world we live in for awhile and transports us into his world of gladiators and violence.<br />Russell Crowe is the topping on this creamy pie - the one that binds it all together. He has created such a believable character that you wanted to cry - cheer and feel anger with. <br />The DVD is splendid - transfer is good almost perfect. Sound is PERFECT especially the DTS!<br />Extras are also good.. but look out for the Easter Egg.. Check out the easter egg sites out there... (rhino fight scene)
6300214435|1.0|This movie stunk so badly. It started out promising, with the nightclub scene and all. And I was even willing to suspend disbelief at all the airplane antics, but the over-the-top racism of this movie stuns me.<br />How can anyone with half a brain find this non-offensive?<br />Saved by the British??? The British were MURDERING people!!! How 'bout the utter mangling of a religion practiced by more people than there are Christians?<br />White damsel in distress dressed in white threatened by the hordes of dark heathens???<br />I loved the other Raiders movies. And I got this one because I thought the locale would be interesting. But Spielberg blew it big time.<br />I used to respect his work and that of Harrison Ford and Roshan Seth.  What were they thinking?
B00000K31Q|4.0|Teen movies. Some are good. Some are bad. I'm a big lover of the 80's teen movies, and can only bare a few of the modern day ones. This is one I really like. I was pleasantly surprised when I first saw this cute, charming movie. Joseph Gordon Levitt(\\"3rd Rock From The Sun\\") plays Cameron. He has moved to Seattle and is the new kid in school. He quickly befriends a geek(David Krumholtz from \\"The Santa Clause\\"), who gives him the run down of the school and it's students. Cameron falls madly in love with Bianca Stratford(Larissa Oleynick, who, coincidentally, played his girlfriend for a while on \\"3rd Rock\\"). Bianca is a the quintessential popular, beloved, rich girl who is untouchable. Cameron makes it his mission to get to her. Then there is Bianca's sister Kat(Julia Stiles). She is the 'Anti-Bianca'. She is tough, sharp mouthed, and generally hates people. Their dad, who is played the always watchable Larry Miller, makes a deal with his daughters. Bianca can date as soon as Kat does. Bianca is upset because Kat doesn't want to date. This begins Cameron's mission. He and his friend enlist a tough, brooding guy named Patrick(Heath Ledger)to start wooing Kat, for cash, supplied by empty, pretty boy Joey(Andrew Keegan of \\"7th Heaven\\").If he succeeds, then Cameron can date Bianca. Naturally, things get complicated and awful before they can get better and work out for everyone involved. The film is based on William Shakespeare's \\"The Taming Of The Shrew\\". Julia Stiles was first noticed with this film. There is something so intoxicating about her. She has a special quality to her that is irresistable. Her smile is a wondrous thing. She is a star. The movie is very funny, and surprisingly funny in some ways. The dialogue is pretty clever, sharp, and well written. It is head and shoulders above most teen comedies of the last decade. The actors are all well suited for their roles and are enjoyable to watch. Larissa Oleynick is as cute as a bug. Allison Janney from \\"The West Wing\\" has a hilarious, but all too brief role as the school's guidance councelor who is in the middle of writing a trashy sex novel. David Leisure also appears as the gym teacher. It is unfair that this movie has to have the tag of \\"teen movie\\" attached to it. To some people, that equals poison. Especially in this day and age. I'm telling you right now people, this movie is better than that. This is enjoyable for any age. It's funny, cute, and has more depth and intelligence than most of these movies combined. If only all teen movies of this modern era could be as delightful as this one. There are many things to like about this movie, but the 10 things I love about this movie are:Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles, Julia Stiles. Sorry.
1558908358|5.0|If you never saw Tron on the cinema during your late childhood, it is time to fix it. Tron is a bit historical because of its special effects old techniques, and for an original story that never came again until now to the cinema. Even if some people think it is made for young people, it is not so true: because of the old-fashioned and funny movie colors, because of a poor violence in the speech and in the images (except one scene), young people will be disapointed. Whatever the way you can see it, it is always a moment of pleasure.
061301328X|5.0|This book takes one immediately into a time of long ago. A lifestyle few of us can imagine living. Clavell writes a wonderous tale filled with honour romance and intrigue. Japan is where the story begins and ends. As readers we are whirlwinded into a culture of beauty and death-we follow the characters as they unfurl and intertertwine with each other. A book well worth reading that will provoke thought and imagination.
B00005JH7D|2.0|MM is of course a talented bass guitar player, but i would put a 'bemol' on this album: it looks like the recording technique was  as for a pop music, meaning nobody plays together, just hearing a background and adding a solo track. It sometimes looks closer to bass technique tricks (with, yes, real good sound) than to real 'together playing'. In spite of all the great players that joined MM to do this album, (Maceo Parker, Wayne Shorter, Kenny Garret, Herbie Hancock, and many others... also Djavan...) I didn't catch the living presence of people in these arrangements and recordings with a kind of synthetic sugar-sound, making all musician too much faded and unpersonnal compared to their usual performance.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Darren Aronofsky is God!  I kept hearing about this movie, as well as Pi, so I finally rented both of them.  While I love both of them, and own both DVD's, I have to say that Requiem for a Dream is a visual, magnificently written, shocking, provocative masterpiece.  I loved this movie.  It is so real.  It is strange, becuase there is no real hero in this film.  The hero seems to be their addictions to their dreams.  Everytime they are doing good, they fall flat on their faces, and worse, are spit on by the people around them.  Libatique and Aronofsky teaming up with classis novelist Sleby Jr., seems odd, but they are all epxerts in what they do, and they made something that will become a standard in every way.  Burstyn's performance is phenomenal, as is Connely's Leto's and even Wayan's.  You can't beat this movie, and the day I see a better one will porbably never come.
6305342776|5.0|Even if Disney was involved in this movie, i find it different from Disney's sf movies. This movie is of course older than old, but if you like old style sf, it is for you. As in every Disney movie, this one contains explicite symbolic scenes to show what happends in the minds... until you fear Maximilian.

B000067CPX|5.0|Kiedis, Flea, Frusciante and Smith have definitely slowed things down a bit for this album.  Just as Californication was much mellower than Blood Sugar Sex Magik, this album has found the Peppers in a more contemplative songwriting state than past works.  However, don't let that turn you off.  This album is amazing!<br />My favorite songs include the title track, Dosed, the Zephyr Song and I Could Die for You.  The collection works great as a concept album of bittersweet lullabies and stripped down, introspective rockers.  The only thing that seems to be missing is the great Flea.  His bass playing on By the Way is fantastic and melodic, but this album lacks the mindblowing funk-rock bass lines that stood out on BSSM and Californication. <br />Overall impression:  BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!
1573225517|2.0|The novel \\"High Fidelity\\" written by Nick Hronby is about a man called Rob Fleming, woh wants to meet all his ex-girlfriends and wants to ask them, why they left him. All this he does because Laura, his last girlfriend left him because of an other man. Now he asks himself, what he did wrong in all his relationships. <BR>I think the novel is not really good, because the story is not very realistic. The protagonist Rob Fleming is a childish and inmature man, who's only interest is how good his sex-life is. I think the story is not realistic. And all that makes the book unreal and stupid.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I don't have this soundtrack yet.  But, I do have the movie on dvd.  I think this soundtrack will make great dancing music.  (I'm a dancer.)
B000067CPX|5.0|Well, the Chili Peppers have taken a different turn as a bandon this one, but that's okay. The music is more subdued, beautiful, and so much more layered on this album. A must for any fan.
B000065U1N|2.0|I love war movies, I will admit.  Whether it is Saving Private Ryan or one of the many war film starring John Wayne, there has always been something special about going to the limit and making sacrifices for what you believe in.  But this movie was just too much of that.  <BR>People say that the first ten minutes or so of Saving Private Ryan is intensive and ultra-graphic.  And they would be right.  About 85% of Black Hawk Down is at the same level of intensity and graphic depiction.  It is almost like a rollercoaster ride from hell.  It left me somewhat dazed at the end.  <BR>Having said that, I thought the cast was wonderful.  The characters were colorful and managed to each stand out in the midst of hellish wave of war imagery bombarding your eyes and mind.<BR>All and all, not a bad film but not an exceptional one.  Less beating about the head and shoulders with the imagery stick and I think it would have been an exceptional one.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Worst movie in the whole world.Don't waste your money.It is really terrible
0670878014|5.0|After seeing at least five versions of this tale in film - one of my great childhood monster loves - I was happy to finally read the novel. As so often occurs with classics, I was as surprised as I was fascinated.<br />For starters, the characters are far more subtle than any of the film versions: Victor F appears as a brooding and obsessed genius, but also as a great lover of life and nature. The monster, who is an articulate and literate creature who read Goethe, is even more interesting, from his hopeful beginning to his bitter reaction at rejection and his thirst for vengence. His eloquence was vivid and his pain horribly realistic.<br />But the work is also fascinating as a window into the mind of the Romantics, who at once strove to reject the rationalism of the Enlightenment yet reflected it. The creature starts off empty and what it becomes is due entirely to his experience. Knowledge is not always good, etc.<br />Finally, the themes are timeless and full of conflict: creativity giving birth to unimaginable destruction, tampering with nature as its necessities overwhelm even genius, and the like. THe book is a kaleidescope of philosophical reflection. The pain of the creator and the monster alike are inescapably linked like father and son.<br />I did find the style of the book a bit difficult. It is full of florid rhetoric and lengthy circumlocutions, as the doctor and then the monster tell their stories in almost identical prose.<br />Highly recommended.
B000002HPV|5.0|5+ stars<br />With Bjork being my ABSOLUTE favorite musician, I have over the years amassed every Bjork cd I can find, but Homogenic is one of my most treasured cds.... simply a masterpiece. After listening to this I have no idea how anyone could NOT like Bjork.<BR>Combining classical strings, electronica, funky beats and Bjork's beautiful voice, into something remarkably dynamic, expressively beautiful.. and probably very personal, yet feelings not unnew to all of us.<BR>Bjork combines so many interesting sounds: accordian, electronic drums, glass harmonica, clavichord, pipe organ, bass, horns, wonderfully funky beats and of course the magificent Icelandic String Quartet.<BR>--And since I have a propensity to talk A LOT, about the things I love, I'll limit my discussion to only my Homogenic favorites. And judging by which tracks I listen to most they are: Hunter, Joga, Unravel, All Neon Like, 5 years, Pluto, All Is Full Of Love.<br />Starting with &quot;Hunter&quot;, Homogenic begins with etheral beats slowly harmonizing with bouyant accordian chords, electronic snare drums, classical strings and Bjork harmonizing in the background. Bjork's starts  'If travel is searching, and home what's been found...I'm not stopping.....I'm going hunting...I'm the hunter.....&quot;<BR>Always conjures the &quot;Hunter&quot; music video in my head, in which Bjork morphs in and out of a polar bear...&quot;How Scandinavian of me&quot;... :-) A favorite, but I'm slightly disappointed Bjork didn't sing the lyrics &quot;You just didn't know me!&quot; included in the lyric booklet, although she includes it in the &quot;Live in Cambridge&quot; dvd.<br />Joga (the name of Bjork's best friend) can be seen as Bjork's tribute to her beloved homeland of Iceland, &quot;All that no-one sees, you see inside of me...You don't have to speak, I feel emotional landscapes.....&quot; Using an ASOLUTELY gorgeous orchestration and rocky electric beats. Perhaps to express the uniqueness of Iceland's terrane. Volcanos side by side with ice tundra and glaciers. BEAUTIFUL!...<br />Unravel-  Unravel is a soft and deeply poignant tune featuring soft organ chords &amp; Bjork's voice echoing over itself in gorgeous layers :-) &quot;While you are away, my heart comes undone...slowly unravels, in a ball of yarn&quot; ...&quot;So when you come back, we'll have to make new love&quot;. <br />All Neon Like-- Probably not every Bjork fan's favorite, but since seeing the &quot;Live in Cambridge&quot; dvd (which you should get!) And the haunting &amp; heart-rendering version of this song, I was awe-struck! :-) The tune has a trippy undercurrent, which some complain is too harsh for the song, but not for me! :-) &quot;I weave for you, the marvellous web. Glow in the dark threads, all neon like&quot; &quot;The cocoon surrounds you, embraces all. So you can sleep, feotus style&quot; &quot;Don't get angry with yourself...I'll heal you&quot; :-)<br />5 Years- A song expressive of perhaps frustration &amp; disappointment in love. It has a really hard bass beat which I adore, but also combining a beautiful score with strings. Certainly creates an interesting atmosphere. Bjork sings<BR> &quot;You think you're denying me of something, well I've got plenty....  <BR>You're the one who's missing out, <BR>but you won't notice, until after five years... if you live that long.<BR>You'll wake up all love-less.<BR> I dare you to take me on.... I'm so bored of cowards.<BR> That say they want, then they can't handle....can't handle love...<BR>you can't handle love.&quot; <br />Pluto (which is Bjork's ruling planet.. since she's a Scorpio)  A wonderul obnoxious song, with all the delightful boisterousness that only Bjork could lend it, and still make it lovable. The percussion goes full force to this punkish brash beat, that makes me want to do some crazy head-slamming dance around the room!  &quot;Excuse me.....but I just have to explode......explode this body off of me.....I'll be brand new tomorrow, brand new....A little bit tired; but brand new.&quot;<BR>Nearing the end, Bjork caterwauls and screams (in tune) but in a way, that makes you like it and certainly astounds :-)<br />All Is Full Of Love, is the etheral calm after the storm of Pluto.... Bjork reassures &quot; You'll be given love&quot; You have to trust it&quot; Maybe not from the sources you've poured yours into&quot; Maybe not from the directions, you're staring at&quot; While slow pulses and harmonic melody (almost oriental-like) lull in the background...... Melt in the soothiness of Bjork's beautiful voice.<br />Homogenic= Magnificent masterpiece!
B00005ATQD|5.0|I initially saw this film at the cinema, with a few friends - afterwards, discussing it, some of us loved it and some of us hated it. This seems to be the general verdict of the film, and part of the problem is the expectations raised by the advertising.<br />The first thing to say is that this about the world of the rich, about America at Christmas - there are fairylights everywhere, sumptuous parties, money being spent and excess of all kinds hinted at. There is a hard poise to the society - note the stiffness of Cruise and Kidman as they prepare for and go to the party at the start of the film. I don't think there's any love shown by Kubrick for the world he is depicting.<br />Getting stoned leads Kidman's character into a confession of fantasy, and Cruise's character responds in a typically unpleasant male way - he is unable to cope with his wife's sexual imagination. He deals with this by almost having sex with a prostitute, and almost having sex at an orgy.<br />I feel that the message of the film is about the need for fidelity and honesty to your partner. Here characters reap what they sow - the prostitute is later revealed to be HIV positive, while the orgy involves Cruise in a tangle of guilt and fear. Extra-marital fantasy is a source of guilt in this film - Kidman's dreams haunt and distress her, while Cruise breaks down when he finds the mask he wore at the orgy on his pillow next to his sleeping wife - a powerful and affecting scene.<br />Kidman gives the outstanding performance here, in a role that should have been expanded. It is a film which seems more popular with men than women, which is understandable as it is the story of Cruise's character. But Kidman's character is the one you root for, although you are uncomfortably involved with Cruise - she confesses her fantasies, to which her husband responds with incomprehension and a dalliance with promiscuity. <br />This is a haunting, uncomfortable and thought-provoking film, dark and hard, about a dark and hard world which is never erradicated.
B00005Y1MT|4.0|I cannot believe only one previous reviewer. This is an excellent two cd set, the sound is excellent although the bottom end sometimes pushes my speakers to their limit. You have to listen to this cd in one sitting as it is too adictive to get up and leave unfinished. I can't explain why I keep playing this work but there are moments that you can't get out of your head. This is IMHO one of Marillions best and if any other band produced a cd of this calibre I would have rated a five. A very moody cd with an interesting story to be heard.The second cd has alternative takes in a rawer form and is equally as good.
B000067CPX|3.0|I'm almost speechless at the new album, not because it is so great but because it is not even remotly Reminiscent of the Chili Peppers most of us had loved. Vocally Kiedis is very strong, sounding the best he has ever sounded.Fuciante is somewhat going back to his old, Freaky Styley type playing. However the electronics used on some of his guitar playing remind me almost of radiohead. It was a big shock to find that the bass is almost a silent buzz in the background, flea has definatly lost his upfront in your face funk playing. Chad Smith carries the beat well, but with simple 4/4 patterns, he's truly not living up to his ability. Basically Die hard chili peppers fans have to except the fact that the old peppers are gone and are not coming back, I give this three stars because it is good music, its just not the Chili Peppers.
B00005YW4H|3.0|Norah Jones has one of those distinctive voices that grabs you upon first listen.   It's subtle, it's soothing, yet haunting at the same time.   Reminiscent of Billie Holliday, Jones definitely has the chops to sing jazz/pop material with great success.<br />So, in this, her debut album, she presents the listener with a set of beautifully delivered, if a bit too languidly at times, pop songs with a slight jazz edge.<br />However, the overall effect of the album is perhaps, unintentionally, sleep inducing.   Too many ballads and not enough uptempos, make the overall CD, while not boring, sometimes too soothing.   Be careful not to drift off into a pleasant nap while listening.<br />A sense of urgency is missing in the production and sometimes in Jones's delivery.   Laid-back is good, but make sure you keep us paying attention too.<br />I look forward to hearing more from this artist and hopefully her next effort will include a more energizing production and more uptempo songs with a stronger vocal attack.
0316776963|4.0|In this book, David Sedaris gives us a comical look into his life, starting with when he was pulled out of classes in 5th grade for Speech Therapy, and continuing through his French lessons in Paris.  The strange events that he recounts give the reader vivid details about his unique history of growing up with a father that had strange shopping and eating habbits, and his own wildly liberal college education.<br />I especially liked the chapter where he was recounting his boyfriend's childhood in Africa, as if he had been there himself.  His details make it possible to imagine that you were actually there, too.
B00005NP04|4.0|This is a very good compilation of some of Martina McBride's best work.   Stand outs are &quot;When God Fearing Women Get The Blues&quot;, &quot;Stranger&quot;, &quot;Independence Day&quot; and my favorite track, reminiscent of Randy Newman's &quot;I've Been Wrong Before&quot;(beautifully covered by Dusty Springfield in the 60s..), is &quot;Wrong Again&quot;.  A clever, yet simple song, delivered perfectly by McBride.<br />Overall, McBride does a good job at navigating between the ballads and the uptempos, although her steel-strong voice seems more suited for rangier material, it's nice to see her keep it under control and strive for the &quot;less is more&quot; approach to singing. <br />However, a few tracks go a bit overboard vocally, (&quot;Where Would You Be&quot; has her screaming too much), but most of the time she tends to stay away from the oversinging common to several current pop divas and for that she must be commended.
0307155102|5.0|Richard Scarry is absolutely fabulous and this is our favorite book by this author.  The drawings are playful and informative.  My child, almost 3, has loved this book since she was 1 1/2 years old.  It has every topic under the sun, including shapes, colors, machines, clothing, seasons, foods, and every page has so much detail that you can read it over and over.  We've had so much fun with this book; it is great for teaching so many things to your child.  This is my favorite newborn or 1 year old present and always well-received by moms. Also a fabulous present for 1-3 year olds.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I've seen this movie 3 times now. I think it's very well done and the acting is great.  Can't wait for the next movie and 5th book to come out. My son and I have a special time together when we read or watch Harry Potter.
B00004XONN|5.0|Once again, Thom Yorke and the men of Radiohead have created yet another epic that will stand true in the world of music. The surreal opening track begins with an almost gothic organ track and Thom proclaiming, \\"Everything In It's Right Place\\". The album on a whole consists of a superlative flow of live instruments, effects, and unwavering vocal mixing.<br />Despite the claims by many music critics, Kid A is by far a timeless masterpiece. My personal favorite, the title track, \\"Kid A\\", is reminiscient of childhood with it's almost whimsical xylophone tune in the background. However, as the song builds, the vocal track, \\"standing in the shadows at the end of my bed\\" destroys any preconceptions you had about Thom or the band itself.<br />Radiohead has come a very long way since the single \\"Creep\\", experimenting with new sounds and ultimately arriving at the prominence they have achieved with their music.
0451196716|5.0|I have read every Steven King book out there and by far this is the best book he has ever written. It captures your attention from the beginning and you are left spellbound as you continue on. I highly suggest to anyone who in anyway likes Steven King to read this book.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest is basically a good guy, he just happens to be kinda slow.  But that doesn't seem to stop him from meeting Elvis, fighting in Vietnam, Investing an apple and founding a multimillion dollar shrip company.  <br />Tom Hanks is brilliant and he plays the part wonderfully.  Although some elements of the book that I would have liked to see were not included it still does not take away from a wonderful proformance.  This movie will have you laughing and crying at the same time.
1573225517|2.0|On the one hand I didnt like the book but on the other hand it was okay. Nick Hornby is a good author, I think, and he is very creative. His speech is funny and varied. He has chosen many different and also extreme characters. &quot;High Fidelity&quot; isnt a book like others. I think it is both, a diary and a novel because you find out a lot about Robs thoughts and feelings.<BR>But what I didnt like was Robs character. He often is selfish and egocentric. He can be a real macho and isnt interested in someone else than himself. But after a while ha changes. It seems as if he has matured. He develops from a boy to a man.<BR>All in all the book isnt the worst I have ever read. It has a few boring passages bur if you dont take Rob seriously the book is funny, too.
B000002H72|5.0|New bands could learn alot from the pixies and this great album &quot;Doolittle&quot;. Its always been my favorite and always will be. Black francis has come up with the most inspiring lyrics in the history of rock, weither you understand them or not, they'll make a diffrence in the way you hear music.

B00004T37H|5.0|I have my own personal reasons for being iffy about anime.  But I couldn't help but watch this movie about five times after I first discovered it!  <br />&quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; is disturbing, complex, original, weird, and beautiful--and worth watching just for Keith &quot;Goliath&quot; David's sonorous voice (dubbed version) in several roles.
B00005JKCF|1.0|I, like many of you, saw the trailers and previews for SPIDER-MAN and thought, man is this movie going to kick... but man was I wrong. This movie was horrible. I'm not a man who's that hard to please, and I can enjoy a good popcorn flick every once in a while, but this was just as bad as {another movie}.<br />The movie as we all know is about a Peter Parker being a nerd, gets bitten by a spider, becomes a superhero, and has to save the world. Compared to movies of its own genre, it has NOTHING NEW TO OFFER, which is the main thing wrong with it. Atleast X-MEN's story was clever, and even had roots in history ...<br />Also, I didnt think the acting was bad but it wasnt anything great. The main thing that bothered me is the movie felt like it was holding back. The movie tries so hard to please its kiddy audience and is so P.C. friendly... The movie also felt way to surreal. I mean, at least BLADE felt surreal to add to stlye, this just felt like a FAKE New York, unlike FAKE New York of THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, or REAL New York of KIDS...The movies pace is also all wrong. The movie sets up way to many things that never pay off, but will in the next movie though, but your so not caring, you probably wont check it out.<br />Also, Sam Raimi CAN'T DIRECT. I'm sorry, but i enjoyed a few of his other flicks but this one just flat out [failed]. Atleast all those who hated THE MATRIX thought it's action was okay but there is NO decent action scenes here, and the ending fight was so lame, I was glad Spider Man was getting his [rear] kicked. In the end, the movie let me down in A BIG WAY.<br />FOR FUN \\" CHECK BRAIN AT DOOR\\" ...<br />----- A negative review for SPIDER MAN, a movie aimed at my age group, TEENAGERS-------------

B00005JLEX|5.0|I want Seinfeld on DVD. Why? Because I cant see it on TV any more. In Australia, no free-to-air network now shows the series, it is being shown on Pay-TV, which 1 million out of the 20 million people in this country have access to (I'm one that doesn't have access to it). I understand ours is a smaller market and will probably make less money than the US market, but Seinfeld has an unbelievably huge following in this country. If Jerry Seinfeld, and the owners of the series want to make real money in Australia, stop showing it through FOXTel, and release it on DVD to EVERYBODY, people want to watch, and have access to their favourite episodes.. The special features could be amazing, with commentries, outtakes, deleted scenes, etc... It will make many people happy, and as a by-product, make you $$$.. :)
B00005YU1O|4.0|Waking Life was a horrid dissapointment.  It was trite and dull -- the whole movie was like listening in on the ponderously introspective conversations of suedo-bohemian yuppies in starbucks.  Those people who hear a lot of interesting names and theories and then repeat them as if they had a clue what they were talking about.  It's the kind of movie to watch if you want to SOUND smart without doing any thinking on your own.  It's not a thinking man's movie, it's a people who like to think they're thinking men's movie.  <BR>Now you say, &quot;Well, why rate the movie four stars and then rank on it so?&quot;  Simply because the animation is astounding.  It's fluid and beautiful -- slipping styles seemlessly.  The only clever humor (the only clever anything)  comes in through the animation.  It is really worth suffering the bordome of false intellectualism to see this animation.

B000063DI9|5.0|I do not think using subtle keyboards or different guitar effects makes any album a sell out. Thats just stupid, plain and simple. Unfortunately, some of my metalhead peers feel differently (although I agree with the reviews on this site). <br />What we have here is Maiden STILL in their prime. Yes, I'm not going to be lame and say their good music ended in 1985, but it is safe to say this is the last classic Maiden release until Brave New World IMO. Think about it, if Maiden would have released Powerslave #2, people would label them boring, dull, running out of ideas, etc. These guys keep their music career alive with albums like this and Somewhere In Time.<br />I understand that this album is generally considered a classic today, which is great, but upon it's release it was thought of as a sell out. Only the lame still think that.
B00000K3UU|4.0|I watched this movie for like the 15th time last night and I was still rolling on the floor laughing. This is the best Adam Sandler movie he has made, and the little boy is a cute little actor too. I just love this movie.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|The OST of Moulin Rouge lives up to the movie!!  The sounds of all the songs feel as if I am actually watching the movie!  The Soundtrack could have slightly been improved, however.  Some of the songs missing have been included in the second soundtrack.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sing really great!  The soundtrack compiled the best songs people would want to here.  THe sounds haunt your ears as David Bowie's voice did in the last track (Nature Boy).  This is something I recommend for people to buy who have watched the movie and really enjoyed it.

B0000640SA|1.0|If you're looking at the limited edition disc of this movie, it's a safe bet you're familiar with the movie, plot, acting etc etc.  So I'll focus on the discs themself.  The first disc is fine, the menu I can understand.  But when you get to the commentary... that's when we start to slide down the surface of things.  See... at the last 15 minutes... the track is backwards.  Like something out of Twin Peaks but not played forward and without subtitles.  Too bad we can't play it in reverse and hear what Mr. Nolan is saying.  For all I know he could be making fun of us for buying this overpriced coaster and listening to his commentary spoken backwards.<br />  The second disc is a mess.  I was able to find the movie played in chronilogical order, but in the week I had it (I sold it and bought the normal version) I couldn't even access the trailer.  You have to take these tests and if you answer wrong you go to backwards, and there are soooo many questions that it's hard to keep track of the path you're on.  I was also able to see the foreign posters and a special that was on IFC.  Rumor has it that there are more features but I couldn't find them.  It's a great idea... but it's too dang complicated.  I don't mind the occasional easter egg on a disc but when the whole disc is one?  Forget it.  Call me old fashioned but I am happy with my normal not so fancy version of the movie where I can access the trailer, and TV spot and original short story without going through hoops and laddrers.  Ugh.  I think I know why this is limited edition... because it will create many ticked off viewers.  Like I said though... the movie is great, just not the Special Edition disc set.
B000065U1N|4.0|I suggest everyone do some homework regarding the events that lead to this black eye in US Military history.  Like Vietnam, Operation Restore Hope is a perfect example US Political leaders using our most valued resource (our sons and daughters) to gain favor with the electorate or foreign countries.  The blame starts at the top and ends with Gen. Garrison.  For their mistakes and miscalculations America lost 19 brave and honored souls.  What a waste!<br />Suggested reading: Col.

B000066796|2.0|Just got done with this flick a few hours ago, and I found it to be pretty disappointing.  There is absolutely no character development beyond The Duke, especially in the case of \\"Kate\\", played of course by Meg Ryan.  Her shallow, flippant personality and seeming lack of emotion make it hard to see why the Duke fell so madly for her so quickly.  (By the way, that stringy, shaggy 'do doesn't suit her at all).  Beyond that, it had quite an intriguing beginning, and Hugh Jackman was absolutely mesmerizing in his role as the eloquent, chivalrous Duke, who is bored in his life of privilege and duty and longs to change the world and experience true love.  Liev Schreiber was convincing in his supporting role as Kate's ex-boyfriend, the not-mad scientist who brought Leopold to our day through a \\"crack in time\\".  Natasha Lyonne was as forgettable as always as Kate's secretary, and Bradley Whitford did a great job at playing Kate's creepy egomaniac boss.  Rent it if you must!
B000002UB6|5.0|First off, this is a must for any album collector simply because of the inclusion of four songs from the infamous, last concert the Beatles ever gave: The Rooftop Concert on January 30th of 1969. These songs being Dig a Pony, I've Got a Feeling, One After 909, and Get Back, and you can actually hear the boys singing!<br />And hey, what's wrong with the album anyway? &quot;Two of Us&quot; is just a wonderful song for the emotional Beatles fan, as it has John and Paul harmonizing together with acoustic guitars for the last time ever... racking my brian through the songs on Abbey, and I think that last statement of mine is accurate... &quot;Dig a Pony&quot; is fun for the Lennon fan, especially his voice in this one-- hoarse and involved... .. and of course you've got your classics, &quot;Across the Universe&quot; (which sounds fine to me) &quot;Let It Be&quot;, &quot;Get Back&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; (I think the orchastrizations are wonderful, they make the song all the more poignant... be interesting to hear the song devoid of those violins though, is that on Anthology 3, I wonder?) <br />I don't see why so many people put down the acerdic &quot;I Me Mine&quot;-- what's wrong with it? I personally think it's one of George's better Beatle efforts... it's sincere anyway, listen to the bitterness in his voice... and the lyrics-- obviously reflecting upon his relations with the other Beatles and recording studio, and the contract... and then that almost chipper chorus comes and saves you from the nadir of George's depressing rut... I-I Me Me Mine! :-p<br />I love the short bits-- why any Beatle fan would dislike them is beyond me... The Beatles, half the reason they are so popular is because of their overbearing personalities and what shows personality better than &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; Can't you see them horsing around in the studio? Okay, fine, disregard all the altercations going on at the time-- now can you see it? But John's vocals in &quot;Dig It&quot; make it notable, and a rare duet between Mr. Lennon and Ringo in &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; is priceless! Listen to the contrasting voices... do it right now!<br />&quot;One After 909&quot; is a fine song, the only pure rock song on this album besides &quot;Get Back&quot; and a stroll down memory lane, but advanced to the then-current groove the Beats were in... &quot;For You Blue&quot; is another nice song.<br />Saving the best song for last, &quot;I've Got a Feeling&quot;-- how can one not simply CHERISH this song! It's wonderful! First off, the catchy, vivid, and poignant guitars in the beginning... is that John on rythym there or George? I don't recall... But then Paul comes in &quot;I've got a feeling...&quot; and his vocals are beautiful and candid-- probably because of the high he MUST have gotten from performing live again... He does his bit, then John sings &quot;Everybody's had a hard time...&quot; (who can't like that &quot;Ev'ry had a wet dream&quot; line?:p) and then, glory of glory, one of the finer moments in the later Beatles albums when John and Paul's partenership had begun to fade, they both come in and rieterate what they'd just sung-- at the same time! You've got Paul doing his &quot;I've got a feeling&quot; thing while John's singing his &quot;Ev'rybody's...&quot; Wonderful bliss!!<br />Buy this album, I feel bouyant just thinking about it-- it's all worth it for that last song... Escasty!

B000068QY7|4.0|Heathen Chemistry has taken some flak for many of its songs being derivatives of old Oasis songs or Beatles songs.  For Example, people say that &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; sounds like &quot;Slide Away&quot;.  So what?  &quot;Slide Away&quot; was a heck of a song, and Stop is different enough from &quot;Slide Away&quot; that it makes a great song on its own.  <BR>Among the songs Noel sang, &quot;Force of Nature&quot; is not that great, but &quot;Little by Little&quot; is.  Other highlights include &quot;The Hindu Times&quot;, Gem's &quot;Hung in a Bad Place&quot;, &quot;Born on a Different Cloud&quot;, and &quot;Better Man&quot;.  Even the hidden instrumental at the end is worth listening to.
0790749815|3.0|Not quite.  I wanted to see this movie, as I've heard so much about it.  It is supposedly one of Hitchcock's greater works.  I watched it with high expectations.  It wasn't a bad movie.  However, it got a little long, and the suspense wasn't that great.  If you really want a good Hitchcock, watch &quot;Rear Window,&quot; and &quot;Torn Curtain!&quot;  These two are, in my opinion much better movies, and much more suspenseful!  There are many, many other movies that are a lot better than this.  I don't see where critics get their ideas on what is and isn't a good film.  If you're a fan of Hitchcock, watch it because of that, but don't hold your breath.

B00000HZTB|5.0|Let me get this out in the open so we're all on the same page, I'm a Lou Reed fan.  I enjoy virtually all of his solo records, never expected some sort of extension of his work with the Velvet Underground, and feel he has at times gotten unfairly treated by a music press expecting something that will never come, mainly, records that would touch as many people as his previous band's did.  His epic solo catalogue is exactly that, a document of a single songwriter finding his way with different bands and, at times, different styles.  The songs themselves more than stand the test of time, even on recordings when Lou got bogged down with exactly how he tuned his dozen guitars.  That said, for my money \\"The Blue Mask\\" is his best record.  Lou and Robert Quine couldn't sound better together; tough, lean complimenting sounds to great melodies and, naturally, wonderful lyrcis.  Heavy, dense tracks like 'The Blue Mask' and 'Waves Of Fear' rock like Lou rarely does, cruching walls of sound punctuated with horrifying imagery that seem to always get personal in the most chilling fashion (\\"Make the sacrifce-mutilate my face-if you need someone to kill-I'm a man without a will\\").  But the true brilliance of the record is the quieter moments, odes of admiration to a former mentor, a love song to his wife that seems to be a modest stab at something almost radio friendly, and an effective time piece about America's lost innocence.  These songs pull you inside the worlds of their protagonists, one moment your nursing a hangover and wondering why your leg hurts, the next remembering why you love your girlfriend.  Oh yeah, and there's one about a guy with a gun, who knows how to use it...
0385335482|4.0|If you want some easy, truly enjoyable reading, this book is something for you.<br />The heroine, Rebecca Bloomwood is a shopaholic, and her main problem in life is how to pay her cradit card bill. Or, no, may be this is not actually a problem; letters from the bank can easily get lost, phonecalls from the bank can be denied because you are too ill to speak to them, and of course next month you will be able to pay, when you win the top prize in the national lottery.<br />Rebecca is another female, single Londongirl, following in the line of so many others, starting with Bridget Jones. And the story about Rebecca is so funny written, once you start the book you want to read non stop untill the end. Will she be able to pay her debt, will she CB (Cut Back) or will she MMM (Make More Money) The most enjoyable side of the book is that it spotlights so many of today's shopping habits, where the only comfort is to buy oneself a little something. And of course shopping is the meaning of life, well, at least looking at prizetags is. What's the point in visiting a museum, even the famous V&amp;A, where the displayed items have no prizetags?<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland

B0000067L2|5.0|There are some very comprehensive reviews of this album already so I shall avoid taliking too much about individual songs.<br />Britain in the 1960s was a very different place to any other in the world. Seventeen years after the war, rationing was almost over, national service was at an end (the draft) and some new music was coming through. In major part we owe it all to the Beatles. They sang American music gleaned from rare imports and made it hugely popular. Their success inspired many others to try and they in turn mined the American r'n'b scene. There were other threads too and as the sixties unfolded, so too did the British music scene.<br />The Swining Sixties brought with it a veritable pop music explosion with lots of groups in the charts, many one hit wonders and great diversity. However, the r'n'b sounds had also led to some musicians searching back to the roots of that sound, in particular John Mayall and Alexis Corner. That search began to take form in the clubs of London and elsewhere which led to the emergence of the 'Underground' scene in the mid sixties.<br />FRom that scene emerged Cream with the young EC, known as God, for his exceptional perfomances of the blues in their long, extended performances which were a trademark of their live shows. Alas, record company preferences were still tied to the Tin Pan Alley values of the fifties, meaning they wanted three minute songs. Soon the Beatles were to disabuse them of that notionbut in the meantime.<br />This album used to be seen under the arm of almost every teenage boy who had a record player shortly after it's release. Whether they realised it's psychedelic value or not is irrelevant. It was THE sound of the moment, British swirling effects and a British guy playing the blues. A marriage made in heaven. Significantly Jimi Hendrix was often to sing the band's praises which added to the level of adulation. Everything about this album was cool.<br />In live performances, the songs would be transformed into long, improvisational pieces where the three protaganists would essentially pit their musical prowess against each other raising the level of playing to extremely jigh energy levels.<br />Disraeli Gears marks the combination of the talents of the three members of Cream. Each wrote songs or contributed to them and the songs reflected their own interests. It is an album of the times in it's capture of the psychedica phase sweeping around the world, and it is a major tribute to three of the most powerful names in rock.<br />This album opened up the world of blues power for all to go and see and brought this powerful simple music to a world audience.<br />With it's eyecatching cover, what can one say about this album but WOW!d into long, improvisational pieces where the three protaganists would essentially pit their musical prowess against each other raising the level of playing to extremely jigh energy levels.<br />Disraeli Gears marks the combination of the talents of the three members of Cream.

B00005OM4N|3.0|Considering her album managed to leak its way out onto the internet before its scheduled release, I'm quite surprised that the album has faired so well.  Before buying the album, I listened to samples of each song, and quickly began to fall for the songs.  Then I heard about a few international bonus tracks that were not available on the U.S. release (\\"Before the Goodbye,\\" and \\"When I Found You\\").  I have to say that I was dissapointed.  If anything, those songs should have made the final cut.  So instead of buying the U.S. release, I splurged and bought the Japanese import, which had those two songs on as well.  As for the album in its entirety, there were a few songs I could have done without.  The fourth single to be released from the album, \\"Boys,\\" was one of my disappointments.  It is way too \\"poppy\\" and took me back to my \\"Rainbow Brite\\" days.  I was pleased to see that it was rerecorded with the Neptunes to produce a more edgier feel to the track.  After listening to the last track, \\"What It's Like To Be Me,\\" I felt that the label needed to fill up some time on the album and used Britney and Justin's vocal brawl to fill it up...it was one of the shortest songs on the album.  I did however, absolutely fall in love with a few of the songs that were and were not on the U.S. release.  \\"Overprotected\\" is one of my favorites.  I love the melody and the way the song comes together...it's a great dance song.  I also like \\"Let Me Be,\\" which is also found on the \\"On The Line\\" soundtrack.  Coincidentally, both of these songs appear to send the message that Britney is struggling to find the personal and artistic freedom she needs.  One of my favorite songs which did not make the U.S. cut is \\"Before the Goodbye,\\" a style which we have not seen from Britney before.  The song sort of falls into the \\"techno\\" category with its infectious beat and lyrical repetition.  Overall, this is a great album if you are a die-hard Britney Spears fan, but if not, there are quite a few songs on the album, which are sure to please you.
0783226160|5.0|If you have ever wanted a good laugh, then WATCH this movie. It comes highly recommended by me. So therefore, it must be good. If you have ever wondered what college is really like, then this is the movie for you. From being placed on double-secret probation by the Dean, to bad mouthing the United States of America the laughs just dont stop. With a cast like this, it was bound to be a classic and will remain that way for years to come.

B000068TPN|4.0|The movie was a good, not perfect, portrayal of the events that occured in November 1965.  The movie fairly closely follows the book and for those viewers interested in getting the full story should get a copy of the book.  Anyone who does this will see that the battle really lasts over three days with a separate battle occuring the following two days.  The movie follows the book up to about the and of the second day.  Then the Hollywood licence takes over and changes the ending of the fight so that Col. Hal Moore, a battalion commander of the 7th Cavalry, looks larger than life.  Col. Moore ,who co-authored the book, was an outstanding officer and his actions and preparations that battle probably saved the lives of many of his soldiers so I was a bit disappointed to see that the film elaborated needlessly to make him appear almost superhuman.  This fact has been critized by other reviewers and I believe the blame lies on the writer and director and not on the acting abillities of Mel Gibson.  I will not spoil the ending for those who haven't yet seen the movie but I will say that the ending is a little more glorious than the actual end of fighting on the third day.  Sadly what happens on the 4th and 5th days isn't mentioned in the movie and for those who feel the movie ends on too much of an upbeat note for such a grim war, they should definately read the book.  It would be an interesting contrast for a film maker to produce a movie showing the second battle that involved the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Cavalry. This second battle was the ominous sign of things ahead for the U.S. Military in Vietnam.  <BR>All in all the movie shows a fairly accurate portrayal of the events and the thinking of the American military at the beginning of the Vietnam War.  Viewers should remember that this is before the attitudes changed at home and it became an unpopular war.  It is a good contrast from movies like Platoon which shows the war after the change has occured.  For those who have seen Platoon, the character Sgt. Elias, played by Willem Dafoe, is a veteran of the Ia Drang battles that are portrayed in this film.  It is definately a movie that should be seen by anyone interested in understanding what the American military experience was like in that turbulent era.
0971855110|2.0|After reading all the glowing reviews, I hesitate to add my somewhat lukewarm comments, but I wish someone else had written these things in their reviews so I would have been warned off purchasing this book and thereby subsidizing her &quot;cause.&quot;  <br />WARNING: Although FlyLady has a few good ideas, she seems to have a religious agenda.  She frequently employs little catch-phrases, such as &quot;God breezes.&quot;  If this sort of thing bothers you or makes you feel that this book is one step up from a tent revival meeting, then stay away.<br />Also, the author claims to have previously had problems with OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder).  Well, it seems she still has, only now she has an outlet for it.<br />Okay, so, why did I buy this book to begin with?  Because I'm always looking for a better way to do things, to better organize my busy life so that I can accomplish more.  I was intrigued with the couple of acronyms I'd heard of from the book/website, such as CHAOS and SHE's.  Who can't identify with these concepts?<br />Did I find the book's instructions effective?  I can only answer by saying that (1) I always wore tie-shoes anyway, and got dressed in the morning and (2) My kitchen sink was always empty and clean even before I read this &quot;manual.&quot;  I guess I am not truly disorganized, by FlyLady's standards.  If you are the type that really and truly does not get dressed on their own, then you do need a fairy godmother to tell you what to do, down to tying your shoes.
B00005QFE5|5.0|I love Chinese films.  I enjoyed Raise the Red Lantern, Farewell My Concubine and other recent releases.  There's something about the film and the technique that is so delicate, so Chinese and so engaging in the individual personalities that make up the story.  After renting this from a DVD service, I had to buy it. It is a beautiful love story, with sacrifice, humor, culture and a story line that anyone in love would enjoy. The story is about a teacher who has come to a village to set up class, the young girl that falls in love with him, sacrifices, and waits for him until he returns.  Great cinematography, beautiful characterization, and a very memorable storyline.
B00005YW4H|4.0|There's been a lot of debate over this CD and what genre it represents.  I don't really care what it is supposed to be- but it is peaceful, light and has a sweetness about it that is not sappy or cheesy.  I really enjoy it and I think Norah Jones has a great voice.  But let's be real- it's not jazz and it doesn't seem to be reaching for more than just being a pleasing and enjoyable album, which is fine!  The lyrics are simple and short but she has a way of giving them some life and her young soul comes through.  Buy this if you want something to lounge to or want to hear a new voice- but not if you are seeking something more ambitious than that.
B000068QY7|5.0|This is possibly their best album after Morning Glory. The guitars are rocking and the songs have anthem-quality again, the production is kept simple, and Liam sings better than ever before. \\"Stop crying your heart out\\" is one of the best damn Oasis song ever and is right up there with Wonderwall and Live Forever. It'll be HUGE! After their miss two years ago, I'm so glad this album is as good as it is. Despite the critics who want them R.I.P., Oasis proved everyone wrong. (Again) they're the best ... band in the world, mate!
0783231202|2.0|Call me naive but I figured Amistad was a movie that would show the horror of the transatlantic slave in much the same way Spielberg used Oscar Schindler's story to show the tragedy of the holocaust. What do we get instead? A courtroom drama. At a point I was wondering if this was a movie about the escaped Africans or the greatness of John Quincy Adams. There is a scene where Morgan Freeman vainly struggles to look noble and inspired after a summation by Adams which leaves us in no doubt of the answer to that question in Spielberg's mind.<BR>It is really curious how the Africans seem to disappear in a movie about them. With the exception of Cinque, no black character is really fully developed. The atrocities endured by the slaves in the middle passage are shown in very brief taut scenes. Even the most shocking lacks the emotional impact of the scene where Amon Goethe decides to use a young boy for target practice because we do not have enough time to know the victims. <BR>Perhaps it is really asking too much for any white American to make a picture about slavery on the same level as Schindler's list. There is after all a question of guilt and no one likes to feel guilty. It is the same reason you don't find German directors making movies about the holocaust. Imagine what would have happened if Spike Lee had directed this joint.<BR>Amistad has its moments. For example a scene where Cinque and his friend try to interpret the bible is very touching. However I cannot recommend this movie. Pick up a copy of the book, \\"The interesting narrative of the life of Olaudah Equiano\\" instead. Olaudah was an 18th century Igbo slave from my own neck of the woods in Nigeria. His perspective will give a truer picture of the horrors of slavery.
B000066AXC|4.0|It's extremely difficult to get into the mind (and therefore the world) of the patient with schizophrenia or a similar thought disorder.  Necessarily simplified from the biography of mathematician John Nash, this film achieves dramatic pace and structure that has no analogue in the life of even some of the most extraordinary individuals suffering from such a condition.<br />Setting aside the fact that Ron Howard's work is not true to the nominal subject of the movie, however, this film comes laudably close to a good clinical depiction of the desperate vividness of the auditory and visual hallucinations suffered by patients with schizophrenia, including the sort of elaborate structures of delusion which the more intelligent individual has been known to develop.<br />I would wish that Howard and his associates had managed to portray something more of the adverse effects of the drugs available to treat schizophrenia in the '50s and '60s.  Indeed, I would've liked to have seen Russell Crowe add to his superb performance some intimation of these harrowing elements so that the audience could better understand the pharmacotherapeutic factors that drove Nash to discontinue his neuroleptic medications and undertake what is essentially self-directed cognitive therapy in order to address his thought disorder.  Even the more recently-developed \\"atypical\\" antipsychotic medicines have pretty nasty side effects, and we are far from perfection in the medical management of schizophrenia today.<br />This is in no way a perfect movie, certainly.  It is, however, good art, and we owe the makers of this film our thanks for helping increase the general public awareness of thought disorders.  Schizophrenia is a great deal easier to treat (both with and without neuroleptic agents) when it is brought to appropriate medical attention at the earlier phases of development, and Russell Crowe has succeeding in putting a human face on the disorder -- much as Tom Hanks did for HIV/AIDS in *Philadelphia* -- with great power and (I hope) telling effect.hiladelphia* -- with great power and (I hope) telling effect.
B000067CPX|5.0|at first i thought it wasnt going to cut it in chili pepper fashion, but now i believe it could be their best album (yea better than BSSM).  its great and the chili peppers have not fell off any.  recommended buy for sure!
B00005YXZH|4.0|Engaging and enjoyable collection of guitar pop that has its exuberant and pensive moments.  The Conet-infused flurry of white noise at the end of &quot;Poor Places&quot; is my personal favorite moment, although &quot;Ashes of American Flags&quot; is another high point in my book.  For someone who's never been into the &quot;Americana&quot; thing (I own a copy of Uncle Tupelo's genre-spawning debut, and that's it), I can't attest to the &quot;no depression&quot; factor (or lack thereof) of this album, but I do like it for what it is.  That said, I had no idea just how much Jeff Tweedy sounds like Jerry Garcia (or even Stephen Malkmus) at times.
B00003CX5P|1.0|The Phantom Menace, which carried the hopes of so many Star Wars fans, was a dissappointing on many levels.  The acting is merely mediocre, with the exception of Liam Neeson who is the films only redeeming feature.  The overload of digital material also destroys the magic that was present in the other films.  So what if the characters in the older films were people in rubber suits?  At least there was something real about them.  This film gives you the feeling that you are watching a computer game, therefore there is no attachment to any character.  All of the grandiose ideas of what the Jedi order may have been like are also shattered in this story.  This film may be appealing to the up and coming generation with its glossy images and lack of intellect, however, the fans of the original trilogy, like myself will not experience the old &quot;magic&quot; with this film.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Excellent movie altogether.  Nice storyline, character developement.  I was on the edge of my seat as I watched this movie in the theatre even after the 4th time.  Yes, I saw it 4 times in the theatre.  What can I say?  I loved this one.  And what really surprised me was how clean and tame it was.  Granted there were some gross scenes but I was expecting all-out gory-bloody messes left and right like the movie.  So I was very impressed by that.<br />Why did I give it only 4 stars you ask?  Well for two reasons:  One, the director totally strayed from the video game story line.  And this movie was mainly bent on the pleasing the fan boys.  And nothing makes a fan boy more mad than straying from the game storyline.  And seccond:  All the Milla fanboy pleasing scenes were not needed at all.  I got a little disturbed in the end when she was wearing that lovely hospital gown.<br />But don't let that stop you from purchasing this great movie.  It's good none the less.
B000067CPX|5.0|(Couldn't resist the title.)<br />By the way came out today and true to those music reviewers lucky enough to get a preview copy, the Chili Peppers have pushed their way through the 80's and 90's going through a metamorphasis influenced by their environment, lives, and even the grandmaster of funk himself.  This album represents a bar of musical maturity matched by few modern bands of the past century.  As you listen with each passing you song you expect them to fall from the high ledge from which they play.  It never happens once during these 68 minutes, bouncing between different stylings.  If anything on this album gets radio play time, I might actually start listening to the radio again.<BR>Thank you guys for bringing us with you through your musical journey and up to this precipice.<BR>May the journey continue.
B000065U1N|5.0|I thought it was going to be a &quot;Hollywoodized&quot; overly dramatic movie.  Boy was I proven wrong.  This movie contains excellent combat sequences, compelling acting by famous actors such as Josh Harnett and yes:  Jedi master himself Ewan McGreggor.<br />I loved the way this movie did not stray from what really happened.  I read the book Black Hawk Down years before the movie came out and I must say they did a good job of not altering it.  But then again they didn't have to.  The real story is great as is.
B00005JKNF|3.0|Period pieces are not everybody's thing.  I know grown men who would gladly eat glass rather than sit through one.  And really, can you blame them?  Costume dramas are almost always boringly similar.  People wear fancy clothes, sip tea, become attracted to people they shouldn't become attracted to, and say things like, \\"I love Lord Fibberbush, but he's not of my class!  Oh, the pain!\\".  If you're a historian, it's usually fun.  If you're a normal person, it's usually agony.<br />So it's pleasing to report that Robert Altman's Gosford Park is a refreshingly entertaining period piece, filled with snappy dialogue (when you can follow it), murder, sex, and an attractive, if not downright exhaustive, cast.  It's also refreshing to see that the notion of servants having more integrity than the people they serve has been debunked here.  Here, both upstairs and downstairs feature characters who lie, gossip, and backstab.  Altman's direction, as always, make you feel like a voyeur, like you're watching something you're not supposed to.  And that's the fun - you're peeking in on one nasty cocktail party, which is always amusing.<br />But, this being Altman, it's an acquired taste.  His overlapping dialogue and low sound mix combine with a broad range of dialects to make viewers strain to hear everything.  You're not supposed to hear everything, of course, but not everyone will know that, and it could be annoying after a while.  The film is also a bit of a puff piece.  It doesn't say anything particularly new about class struggles back in 1930's England, then again it doesn't try.  The reason Gosford Park feels like more than what is actually is is more a tribute to the cast, particularly Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith (who could do her part in her sleep), Michael Gambon, and Clive Owen.  Owen, in particular, has \\"movie star\\" written all over him.  He has a presence that trumps everyone else on screen, and it should serve him well if, as rumored, he becomes the next James Bond.<br/>Overall, Gosford Park is a nice, airy entertainment brought to a higher level by the skill of its stars and its director.  It makes for a nice evening diversion.  That is, if you haven't got any fox hunts scheduled.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Personally.  I'm not a Kevin Smith fan.  However when I purchased and watched this yesterday, my brother and I could not stop laughing.  We loved all the scenes, especialy with the guy in the bathroom after Dante's Ex came out.  Funny stuff. A real depiction of what REALLY happens behind the counter of any retail business.<br />This is a must have for anyone who works in retail.  Like me, if you work in retail, you know what they mean by \\"just because they serve you, doesn't mean they like you.\\"  And on top of that, it's well priced here at Amazon.  Just buy it today and enjoy the quality (even though it is in black and white) comedy that Clerks has to offer.
B000065V1V|4.0|This was definately a new direction for Bowie, but I'm glad he took it. If you ask me, he's just proving that he can do anything. It's got some great hits on it, the most memorably &quot;Slip Away&quot; and &quot;Slow Burn&quot;. Notice that this album is released through Columbia, and not Virgin records. I wonder if that means all his older albums will now get re-released. Who knows. This album takes an extension on the newer electirc style he seems to like alot lately, but it's still a lot of fun. If you're a fan, go for it. If not, feel free to pick it up, it's great stuff, but not what people from the 70s are talking about when they say &quot;Bowie&quot;
B000002J09|4.0|I think this sold like a billion copies.  Does anyone not have this record?  If you are an american citizen, &quot;Led Zeppelin 4&quot; was issued to you from the government.  This is required listening.
0783229526|5.0|This movie has great twists and turns throughout the entire thing. Johnny Depp is an amazing actor and his talent really shines in this movie. You can really tell that he did extensive research to become the character that he did.
B00005B36H|3.0|I bought this when it first came out, listened to it like 10 times, and put it on the shelf.  I don't think I've listened to it in over a year.  It doesn't suck, and some of the songs are the best of Tool's career, but I'm just not excited about it.  If you're a huge Tool fan you already own this, and if you're not you should start with Aenema.
B000002NFM|5.0|this cd is one of the most illest cds to date, the sound is phat and the idea is creative! Alot of the songs on this album is filled with energy and beats that will make you wanna get up and mosh around!! smack my up is a song which is hardcore techno that builds up and gets more energetic then keith starts droppin the lyrics \\"change my pitch up, smack my up!\\" The video is unbelievable to, check it out sometime if you hadent seen it! Breathe is a song which has a punkish flavor with some sword rippin with a huge bass line! Deisel power has a hip hop flavor to it with a energetic beat that would make you wanna get up and go all out! the rest of the cd i will leave up to you, but i gurantee its worth your money! buy it!!
B00005K9QP|4.0|Clapton plays a great cover of Freddie King's &quot;Hideaway.&quot; He also does a raw aggressive instrumental &quot;Steppin' Out&quot; &amp; takes nice but brief solos on several other cuts.<BR>Mayall's white singing bugged me for a while ... ( if you want some authentic sounding blues please check out some Howlin' Wolf.)<BR>But this album really grows on you -- some great songs: &quot;All Your Love&quot;, &quot;It Ain't Right&quot; etc.
B000067CPX|4.0|Simply put, this album explores much more diverse and melodic areas and for the most part does it very well with energy and sincerity.
B00005UKE0|5.0|When Harrison was in The Beatles, he was only allowed two songs per album.  This arrangement admittedly found him offering some strange songs (&quot;Love You To&quot;, for example), but it was mostly high-grade material.<br />This arrangement led to him having a large backlog when the band finally fell apart.  All Things Must Pass saw the release of a huge backlog of material Harrison had written but which hadn't been released by The Beatles.  There are some incredible songs on this album which, in my opinion, is the best post-Beatles release by any of its members.  It is consistently strong (if you don't count the &quot;jam&quot; album which was originally the third LP, and is tracks 10-14 of this re-issue) - the songs are lush and beautiful.<br />The bonus tracks aren't anything terribly impressive (although Harrison's 2000 re-recording of My Sweet Lord may be one of the last things he did, I'm not sure), but the original album is so strong I think it warrants 5 stars.
0316666343|5.0|This is a great book that should be read by everyone. From the moment I picked it up it became difficult for me to put it down.  As I continued reading the story I became more and more interested in each of the characters...it felt as though I had known them my entire life.  I look forward to reading more of Alice Sebold's novels.
B00005QCVY|5.0|It's A Wonderful Life is pure genius. George Bailey is a character you can't help but fall in love with. This movie shows how every person touches everybody's life in so many ways. It's a movie that makes you think and possibly re-evaluate your own life. The thing it does the best, however, is it makes the viewer feel good about themselves, and about life in general. Jimmy Stewart is the only actor who could pull off the role of George Bailey and he makes the movie. It's A Wonderful Life is a must-see, if you don't see this movie you will be missing out on something amazing.
1573225517|2.0|High Fidelity by Nick Hornby is not a very interesting novel because it doesnt have much suspense and there are long passages in which he describes the shop or something else. That is boring but there are also a few funny passages, even if they are rare.<BR>The main plot is that Rob Fleming is dumped by all of his girlfriends and now he wants to see them again.<BR>Rob is a &quot;macho&quot; because he is egocentric and doesnt think about his girlfriends emotions and thoughts.<BR>Laura, his last split-up dumped him because he didnt develop and she couldnt cope with this situation any longer.<BR>The language the book is written in is very colloquial. Rob speaks like a teenager. He isnt very respectful and mature. The language reinforces this and it shows Robs emotions. This is typical of him. <BR>All in all, I think the book has a few funny passages but exept of these it is boring, but readers who like stories of not much suspense and many descriptions would like it.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|When I saw the previews to this movie I was not sure if I would like it or not. Anjelina Jolie is good looking yet the movie looked corny.  I was right.  After seeing this movie my friend and I were outside the theater making fun of Tomb Raider when a couple of people came up to us and said we were right about the movie and that it was stupid.<BR>Tomb Raider is just about Angelina Jolie finding stuff and racing some guy to get to tombs first.  One scene she fights off some intruders by shooting some form of wood out of a power drill.  That scene is where I decided that Tomb Raider was a horrible movie and that nobody should be in its presence.  There was also a scene in which a little girl kept disappearing and reappearing in the woods.  Throughout the whole movie I waited for an explanation to this scene but was not surprised when one never came.  I swear the people who made this movie were too lazy to actually watch the monster they have created and that is probably why it is so bad.
B000067DNC|5.0|.....so long to release the 2nd season box set?<br />Fact: Rabid region 1 SG-1 junkies have been scratching their arms in anticipation for close to 2 years. The first 4 seasons of this Sci-Fi classic are a must for any DVD library. <br />From \\"Serpents Lair\\" to \\"Out of Mind\\" this collection contains all you need to become SG 1 savvy. You find the introduction of the Asgard, aka the \\"cool little gray guys\\" and the \\"anti- Goa'uld\\" Tok'ra. We meet Teal'c's family and Sam's father. My favorite episodes happen to play with time. \\"A Matter of Time\\" and \\"1969\\" are excellent.<br />If you are completely lost among the varied plot points of the latest season. This collection should answer most questions.<br />If not. Well...<BR> <BR>I guess we'll all have to wait for MGM to release Season 3
B000002GDJ|5.0|Their 2nd album, _Regatta de Blanc_ is my favorite Police album.  In addition to containing the landmark &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; (Sting's favorite song from the group, as well as Andy Summers' fav) and &quot;Walking on the Moon&quot;, the album also features the extraordinary &quot;Bring on the Night.&quot;  The production on this song is amazing - a crisp, melodic bassline lays beneath Sting's vocal delivery of lines such as &quot;The afternoon has gently passed me by/the evening spreads itself against the sky.&quot;  Songs like &quot;Bring on the Night&quot; indicate where Sting was headed with The Police as well as his own solo career.  The 'punk' aspects of The Police's early work is evident on the Dylan-esque vocal delivery of &quot;It's Alright For You&quot; and one of the most aggressive Police songs, &quot;No Time This Time.&quot;  The Stewart Copeland-written tracks, &quot;Does Everyone Stare&quot; and &quot;On Any Other Day&quot; are fun and melodic, if not as memorable and riveting as the Sting-penned tunes.  Another highlight on the album is the reggae-tinged &quot;The Bed's Too Big Without You.&quot;  In addition to a representation of Sting's songwriting growing stronger, _Regatta De Blanc_ is also a nice example of how great a bass player Sting is.  He's far from flashy - but does anyone write better pop bass lines?  This is an excellent album.
B000067CPX|5.0|This is the freshest, edgiest music to come out in awhile.
0767803434|5.0|This Movie is the best movie I've ever seen. First of all, I find it very cool cause of all the advanced technology involved. Then there is all the action that doesn't give you a moments rest, with up's and down's that make your stomach turn with each new scene, and leaves you with the thought of &quot;what's gona happen next&quot; or &quot;how will he get out of this&quot;? And the actors, ah, there out of this world. Harrison Ford (the President) I don't have to tell you is good, he's my favorite actor. Gary Oldman (head highjacker) is so intense, so real, he has his own unique dry sense of humor that spices it all up. What makes this movie so entertaining, and thrilling, is the fact that you can't take your eyes off till the end, trust me.
B000067CPX|5.0|This is the freshest, edgiest music to come out in awhile.
6305508550|5.0|I am a big fan of Mike Judge.  I really love the shows &quot;Beavis and Butthead&quot; and &quot;King of The Hill&quot;.  This movie had pretty much the same kind of silly humor.  That guy with the stapler was so funny! Anyone who hasn't seen this should go see it right this minute.
B00005JLDW|3.0|I had high hopes for Reign Of Fire, but in the end, the movie is a mess of choppy sequenced shots and plot and little action with the dragons. The trailer pretty much gives you all of the action with the dragons. The rest of the movie is bits and pieces of apocolyptic fare that seems to have taken a page from Mad Max.<br />I am giving the movie 3 stars only because the stars, to include McConaughey, put forth an earnest effort, but in the end, their performances could not save this beast from burning out.
B00005JKED|4.0|This film was very well acted and highly entertaining, but the reason I gave it only four stars is because I think that there were some writing issues. The movie followed Ethan Hawk's character who wanted desperately to be a cop. So, he meets up with Denzel Washington's character and they spend a dull day tofether fightig crime.  However, the more time Hoyt(Hawk) spends with Alonzo(Washington), Hoyt realizes how truley evil Alonzo is. Alonzo, insteadc of fighting crime, gets even with people and he steals from some of them. I reccomend this film.
B00003CXRP|4.0|Tom Hank's role in Cast Away is one of his finest performances perhaps due to the difficulty with which the role presents. Playing the role of Fed Ex employee Chuck Nolan, Hank's character gets marooned on a deserted island when his plane goes down. As some reviewers have noted, the scenario for the film might not have sounded that appealing: a man gets stranded on an island and has to learn to survive with no one there, with his only true friend being (yes) a volleyball named Wilson. But, alas, Tom Hanks is able to pull this off and the movie is one of the more enjoyable films from director Robert Zemeckis.     The real struggle for Chuck Nolan is his seemingly altered state of life: he goes from being someone very much akin to time and life because of his job and his fiancée (played by Helen Hunt) to an individual isolated relying on survival, both physical and mental. He relies on everything he can to get back to the life he once led. The biggest epiphany that he experiences is that he can survive; he only comes to terms with this realization after several failed attempts on the island. Not only does he comprehend the importance of surviving each day, but he has a better understanding later of the significance of pushing forward despite obstacles and changes in life.     The special effects and cinematic strategies used in the film are spectacular and vivid. For instance, the airplane crash scene seems to be so powerfully realistic. The moments of turbulence are followed by the big crash scene into the waters, and the struggle to make it to safety ensues. There are instances of no dialogue, where we see Chuck learning about the island and how to do things like attempting to hunt and find food, but Tom Hanks is able to make these moments entertaining and important. For instance, the frustration of trying to open a coconut shell at the beginning is comical, as well as the attempts to start a fire, ending with his own rendition of \\"Light My Fire.\\"     The message that I seemed to take away from the film was the idea of second chance. That is, if we were given a second chance at life, how would this play out in our lives. Chuck's biggest obstacle is that life has changed so much since his supposed \\"death\\" that he has a hard time tackling exactly what he should be doing, and he has a hard time putting everything together once he gets back.     Overall, this is an excellent film and works well. If there is one drawback it is that the film length is a bit too long (two and a half hours almost). This probably could have been cut down to two hours. The DVD edition has extras that are worth checking out as well.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I was flipping thorugh the channels very close mindedly a couple days ago, and I came to this movie in the beggining thinking, &quot;I wonder what this is&quot;. So as I tried to determine what it was, I couldn't change the channel because I was so interested to see what would happen next. I found this movie to be very well acted, well done, and pretty much perfect.  It was so neat how the film started with the end and ended with the beggining. I reccomend this to anyone who likes watching interesting films that cause you to think.
B00003CXSP|2.0|This is the reason that they should leave originals alone. I actually thought this movie was rediculous. Anthony Hopkins again finds a way to escape and inflict more damage on society. I just find it silly how killers find these amazing ways to escape from the law in these kind of movies, kind of like a deranged Houdini on the loose. This time he's in Italy. Then he is in someone's room slicing them up. Then he is eating someone's brain for breakfast. Would you like eggs with that, Hannibal?  And enough with the &quot;Hello Clarise...&quot;.....haha..very funny. I got it the first time in the original. Please somebody, get this character and lock him up for good so there isn't a Part 3.
0783117523|5.0|This HBO film is based on the real-life supermodel, Gia Carangi.  Angelina Jolies plays Gia, and she delivers a knockout performance. I was suprised at how talented she really was. The film is about a woman who is so beautiful that she is automatically turned into a supermodel.  However, being beautiful isn't always easy and she turns into a drug addict and catches the AIDS virus.  I found this film to be very depressing and realistic.  I reccomend this to any Jolie fan.
B00005NP04|5.0|I bought this CD for Independence Day.  I loved the song and had two other Martina CD's, but Independence Day was the first country song that made me want to shout from the rafters, who is this woman with this incredible voice.  Well, after listening to the whole album, I was just blown away.  The new cuts are awesome and the old stuff like My Baby Loves Me and Broken Wing are blended perfectly into a CD that is a must have for any true music lover.  Rock on Martina
B000066AXE|5.0|This movie was brilliant, and the acting was incredible.  It's a shame that Russel Crowe didn't win the oscar this year for his role as John Nash in this great film.  Well, atleast Jennifer Connelly got one. The film is about real-life genius John Nash, who came up with brilliant theories and eventually won the nobel prize. However, as smart as he may have been, he had a severe case of schizophrenia.  I suggest that anyone who has not yet seen &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, go see it right now.

B00002SSKI|4.0|This is a wonderful movie for teens and pre-teens.  It is about a group of four girls that are all eachother's best friends, and they made a pact to be there whenever one of them needed eachother.  So, now adults, they are all brought together when one of the friend's is having a baby. The film shows the group of friends in both the current time and when they were young teens.  This film is rather entertaining with some pretty talented child actors. The only reason that I gave it four stars instead of five is because I am now too old for this to still be my favorite movie, if I had reviewed this when I was 13 yrs. old, then maybe I would have given it five.  I reccomend it to all young teens.

B00005Q3TZ|5.0|WOW!!  This DVD has it all.  And \\"All\\" is an understatement.  I wasn't crazy about the actual movie itself, considering it had historical \\"flaws\\", and it seemed to glorify the love story, above the actual attack.  So I pretty much purchased this set simply for the supplementals, which alone, is worth the [money].<br />So, when I got home, I read the little message Michael Bay wrote to the new owner.  He really put things in perspective for the film.  He wasn't entirely focused on historical accuracy, or pleasing critics.  He just wanted to make a film that took back the survivors to that certain place or time, and get inside the heads of the people of that pivotal era.  It worked.  That note alone made me re-think the film, and when I watched it again, I actually cried, and basically fell in love.  While the film does certainly have historical inaccuracies, and didn't come off as the history lesson some wanted, it certainly does give the viewer a good grasp of the time and feelings people went through.  The Directors Cut also restores some gratuitous scenes not seen before, which can make you cringe if you're not used to a lot of gore.  And it also does away with an unneccesary scene between Rafe and Danny.  And an interesting scene with Doolittle and his crew is thanfully restored.  Overall, only one minute in all is added.  But the scenes restored and the scene taken out add up, and make for a better experience.<br />Now, on to the special features.  Where to begin???  This DVD is packed FULL of features, that I haven't even gotten all the way through yet.  I enjoyed the commentary from Michael Bay, and really got into the one with Baldwin, Affleck and Hartnett.  The highlight for me, though, is the Boot Camp featurettes.  They're not only funny, but informative.  It gives the viewer a glimpse into actual Boot Camp, and I have more respect for every actor who participated in the exploits.  As for everything else, well, the movie is pretty much analyzed and analyzed until every detail is damn near made clear.  Things in the film still baffle me though.  And then there are historical documentaries on the attack itself, and the Doolittle raid.  Both are informative and intriguing watches.  I know I'm forgetting so much of the features here, and I'm sorry.  But this is a must-have DVD, and I'm only explaining some of the features I found were the best.<br />Overall, the film gets an A-, and the DVD(s) get an A+.  I can't complain about much here.  The only notable complaint would have to be the fact that the film is stretched out onto TWO discs.  WHY???  DVDs have so much memory available on them, and I've watched other 3 hour plus epics that have been compressed onto one disc.  Other than that, everything is spectacular.  And I mean SPECTACULAR!  The packaging is great, the film is good, the extras are fantastic.  This is a must-have.  Go get this right away.  You'll have a better appreciation for actors and directors, seeing what they have to endure to get a movie made.  And then, when it is finished, critics attack their work.  Maybe this DVD will help some of those [critics] realize what's endured while creating a film of this size.  I'm glad I got this, and you will be too, once you get it.
B00005QIPH|2.0|The criticla praise for this album from critics in general and NY critics in particular reminds me a lot of the way NY sportswriters cover the Knicks. Basically, the Knicks have been pretty [sad] for the last few years, but every time they win 2 in a row, the \\"critics\\" start to tout them for the championship. Same thing with the Strokes- NYC hasn't had too many killer bands in the last few years, so when they get something halfway decent, they try to pretend it's the second coming of the Velvets or the Heads. Basically, this is a pretty weak album. Try a little Bardo Pond or Yo La Tengo or Wilco!!
B00003CXZ4|4.0|It is rare these day to see a truly original movie.  Momento fits the bill.  It is a bit more cerebral than most Hollywood flicks so you'll have to pay a little more attention than usual.  Not to give too much away, but it is about a man who has lost his short term memory and is forced to tatoo himself with words to help him remember his mission to avenge his wife.  The movie begins at the end and works its way to the beginning, resulting in a very thought provoking and enteraining film.  I highly reccommend it, and would give it 4 1/2 stars if possible.  Movies only get 5 stars if they are one I would never tire of.  This movie I could watch a few times and not need to see again.  But see it, you won't be dissapointed.

B00005JKGV|5.0|No film has ever rewarded repeated viewings so thoroughly as Lost Highway.  What upon first viewing appears to be a visually stunning surreal decent into impotent libidinous rage is ultimately revealed to be a linear examination of male sexual rage and damnation.  Trust me, if you watch closely and often you will be rewarded with an integrated understanding of even the most seemingly disjointed plot elements.  Watch it frame by frame. Watch it with subtitles.  Watch it standing on your head!  One of the greatest and least understood and appreciated films of all time.
B00005RYKU|3.0|This is an enjoyable, though predictable, thriller that seems more like a made for television movie rather than a motion picture made as a feature film release for the big screen. This is not entirely surprising, as it is directed by Daniel Sackman, a veteran television director.<br />The plot is fairly straightforward. Sixteen year old Ruby Baker (Leelee Sobielski) and her brother, eleven year old Rhett (Trevor Morgan)), are living the lives of normal, carefree kids with their loving parents, Grace (Rita Wilson) and David Baker (Michael O'Keefe). The world, as they know it, comes crashing down on them when their parents unexpectedly die in what appears to be a routine car accident. The family lawyer, Alvin Bergletter (Bruce Dern),  informs the children that the terms of their parents' have left them wealthy and in the care and custody of former neighbors, Erin (Diane Lane) and Terry Glass (Stellan Skarsgard).<br />Before you know it, Ruby and Trevor are esconced in the Glass Malibu home, a huge, luxurious, all glass structure. Immediately, the viewer senses something is wrong, as, amidst all this room and spaciousness, Ruby and Trevor are forced to share a bedroom. A series of unsettling events serve to make Ruby suspicious of the motives of Erin and Terry Glass and cause her to make unwelcome inquiries into the deaths of her parents. What she discovers, however, comes as no surprise to the discerning viewer, who should have little difficulty in figuring out what is going on.<br />The performances, by and large, are adequate. Leelee Sobielski is  somewhat wooden in her portrayal of Ruby, mistaking a deadpan expression for seriousness of purpose. Trevor Morgan is merely annoying, but this is brought about by a script that requires him to utter the word, \\"Sweet\\", everytime he is pleased with something. Their characterization of the children makes it difficult for the viewer to warm up to either of them.<br />Diane Lane sleepwalks through her part, which may be fitting considering her specific personal problem in the film. Stellan Skarsgard is appropriately menacing in a very controlled way. His is one of the better performances. The only odd note is that an accent of sorts seems to occassionally slip out, which is somewhat jarring. Bruce Dern is excellent as the family attorney, as is Chris Noth in the small role of the children's estranged uncle.<br />The DVD provides a very clear, high quality picture and sound. Other than the usual commentary and filmmaker interviews, the DVD does not offer all that much. For those who enjoy the inclusion of deleted scenes, this DVD offers exactly one such scene.g considering her specific personal problem in the film.

B00005BJ2O|4.0|Audiences either loved or hated this movie. I am one who loved it and the music is phenomenal! Ewan McGregor has the most incredible male voice I have ever heard. Someone, please, give this guy a record deal! The only problem I have is that some of the great songs from the movie aren't on the soundtrack, like &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular&quot;, the version of &quot;Come What May&quot; that was in the film, &quot;Carry On&quot; that Nicole Kidman and Jim Broadbent sing in the film, as well as the song the cast sings at the very end. Hopefully they'll come out with a CD of More Songs from Moulin Rouge or something. I'd definitely buy it if they did.
6304198493|4.0|Christopher McQuarrie's Academy Award winning, original screenplay, coupled with Bryan Singer's masterful direction of a stellar cast, makes for a complex and absorbing film. Told in flashback, the film recounts how five individuals on the wrong side of the law hook up to steal a multi-million dollar cache of cocaine from a docked vessel.<br />Led by former Los Angeles detective turned bad guy, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Roger \\"Verbal\\" Kint (Kevin Spacey), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Todd Hockey ((Kevin Pollack), and Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), proceed to their rendevous point and begin executing their plan of action. Their foray into this million dollar drug heist turns bad almost immediately. Something or someone is afoot who does not want them to succeed, and who seems to know their every move.<br />The story is told in flashback by \\"Verbal\\" Kint, a club footed, crestfallen, soft spoken, unlikely looking criminal. He recounts the details of the doomed heist to hardnosed Detective, David Kujan (Chazz Palmentieri), building his story around an almost mythic, Hungarian crime lord named Keyser Soze. As \\"Verbal\\" details what happened, the viewer is mesmerized by his compelling narrative of how he and his partners in crime were inveigled into attempting this daring heist, which ultimately led to the disastrous events that culminated on the ship. It seems that their heist was probably destined to be doomed from the start, as another agenda may have been paramount to theirs.<br />Kevin Spacey won a 1995 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his low key, ingratiating portrayal of \\"Verbal\\" Kint. Gabriel Byrne also gives a compelling performance as the cop who ended on the wrong side of the law. The rest of the cast also give stellar performances, with the exception of Benicio Del Toro, who gives an odd, marble mouthed performance.<br />Notwithstanding this, the film is really a splendid tour de force that is sure to captivate the viewer. Who is the mythic Keyser Soze? Watch the film and find out.ic Keyser Soze? Watch the film and find out.
B00005JKNC|5.0|Setting in LA and a local town of CA in 1950s McCarthy ear, &quot;The Majestic&quot; tells us a Hollywood screenwriter's life-change story, Peter Appleton was blacklisted for the suspicion of being a Communist by HUAC, though getting involved in a traffic accident and losing the memory, fortunately he was alive and picked up by a old man from a local town called Lawson, in that town he was mistakenly identified as a hero-a missing soldier and was warmly welcomed simply because he was perfectly alike the missing soldier. The love of his &quot;father&quot; and the kindness of town people totally changed his attitude of life. The Majestic, a movie theater in the town, was the turning point where he made the choice to live a down-to-earth life rather than to fade in Hollywood.<BR>It is worthy of keeping a DVD of this movie, because it shows its heart-warming scenes to the audiences. See, when a man tries to change his mood by watching a movie through TV, no one wants to be educated or lectured but everyone like to be warmed and moved simply and honestly like going to see a classic movie in &quot;The Majestic&quot;. It is everyone's voice.

B000002H33|5.0|I am a new Metallica fan who just started listening to Metallica's music. I heard the song ''The Unforgiven II'' on the radio and I loved it, so it led me to buy the album ''Reload''. I thought that it was an awesome album. I loved all the songs on it. Then I bought the album ''Master Of Puppets'' because I heard it was Metallica's best. I have to say that this album is outstanding. I don't own all the albums yet but this is the best collection of heavy metal I have ever heard. There is only 8 songs but it is over an hour of great heavy metal music with not one boring moment. This album is much better than Reload but all of Metallica's songs that I have heard so far are great. I am a new Metallifan but I know that this is some of the greatest music I have ever heard. ROCK ON METALLICA!
B000065U1N|3.0|Another Hollywood war movie. Yes the movie is great in some ways in showing the full nature of the event but then there is that main character who is the worst actor I have ever seen. Why does every war related movie have to put one of these Top Gun kinda guys in there? This movie is definetely a need to see but unless your one who can ignore the bad acting it might be quite painful.

B00005JKQZ|5.0|This movie is one of the best i've seen all year! It was heartwarming and heartaching. It had twist and turns and there were several times during this movie in which I felt as I was living the life of John and Alicia Nash. I loved the fact that you saw the story from both point of views. In my opinion, that was a key element in the movies success. John Nash, a brilliant mathmatition who founded the basis for all economics in a college paper, becomes a scitziphrenic. Without giving the ending away, all I can say is this movie has touched many hearts and mine was one of them. I think this movie deserves more that 5 stars and deserved more academy awards!
B00003CX9Q|1.0|Spielberg really messed up this time. Why oh why is he putting the 2002 version on this dvd? The computer graphics look botched up, and we didn't need the extra scene in the bathtub. The original version would have been a smarter move to put on a collector's edition dvd. The puppet from the original looked just fine. He really messed up.
B00003CXI0|4.0|As a librarian, I have naturally been aware of the Harry Potter phenomenon for quite a while now.  While there may be a few of my colleagues out there who are not so wild about \\"Harry,\\" nearly all welcome the enthusiasm the series has engendered and remain ever hopeful that some of those reluctant readers in their communities (adults as well as children) might become absorbed in the series and inspired to read more and more \\"Harry,\\"  then maybe seek out similarly themed books and then, if the ball really gets rolling, discover a whole world of reading above, beyond but still including fantasy.  It could happen. You never know. We guardians of the printed word have to put our faith in something.<br />OK,OK I must confess, from everything I'd heard and read, \\"Harry\\" wasn't likely to be my own particular cup of English tea. So after all these years, I still haven't actually read it. I'm not a children's librarian, so it wasn't an absolute must. Certainly, I was intrigued by the whole phenomenon but just not in any hurry to read it myself.  Not when there's so much depressing adult literature to plow through. So when the film version came out, I thought it would be a good way to get a feel for what this Harry thing was all about.  The fact that it was reported to be quite faithful to the book made checking out the film version all the better.  Now I could fake my way through lengthy (and they do tend to be lengthy)conversations with Harry-Potter-Heads if I had to.<br />It still took me nearly six months to see the film. Locally, it wasn't around as long as I thought it was going to be.  Finally, on its second or third run, I was able to catch it...at a drive-in!  (Yes, there are still some left here in the Northeast).  It turned out to be the perfect setting, watching this elaborate fantasy unfold while sitting in my own private bubble. (I may have been the only person who ever went to a drive-in ALONE). But it was good, kind of like the solitary pleasure of reading.<br/>I'm half-kidding when I say that the movie's literalness was a plus.  I'm sure there are Potter fans out there who would have welcomed something not quite as faithful to a text they already knew by heart.  But when you consider how young (or, at least, young at heart) so many of the readers are, and how none of us likes his fairy tales altered one jot, the film version's slavishness to the original was probably the only possible artistic choice.<br />Any criticisms?  Well, yeah.  Child actors need special coaching.  I'm not one who believes that there are only a few exceptional Haley Joel Osments or Hayley Millses out there.  But they do need special care from their drama coaches and directors.   This is especially true when they're required to deliver \\"adult-level\\" dialog.  It's not surprising that these young sorcerers have exceptional vocabularies: they're SUPPOSED to be special, but in fact, much of the scripted dialog does not come trippingly off the young actors' tongues.  <br />If that's the worst I can say about the movie though, it's not saying much.  Enjoy the film! And its no doubt worthy sequels. And don't forget to read the BOOKS!  (Do as I say, kids, not as I do.)
0345350499|5.0|If you like history, and good storytelling then pick up this book. You will not be disappointed. An account of Arthurian legend from a feminine perspective (don't let that word scare away the gentlemen this enticing book is written for everyone) this book is steeped deeply in mysticism and history. While most books focus on the story of Arthur and the betrayals that destroy his kingdom, this book instead focuses in on the cultural and political changes as Christianity sweeps across a pagan land as told through the eyes of the women who surround the throne. You are drawn into a world where people are fighting not just for their survival, but for the survival of their beliefs. And that is really at the essence of the Arthurian legend. Bradley seamlessly takes the struggle between the druidic and christian religions and deeply embeds it into her book. This theme reveals itself many times throughout the book and has many different levels of deepening symbolism.  By the end of this book you will question everything from the realities of religion to the way we treat one another. This is an amazing book that has been meticulously researched to be as accurate as possible to the time in which it is set. Truly a novel take on one of the most enduring legends in English literature.
B00006690F|5.0|In his third album, Eminem somehow delves deeper into his troubled psyche and gives us his best work to date. One can clearly see the evolution from \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" in the content of the songs. Gone are the screams of wife Kim and mother Debbie, and in their place are those of Marshall himself (see \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\"). This album is patently less controversial for this reason, but as a result the material has much more meaning and carries more weight. Behind the hip-hop background there is a sense that Eminem has changed as an artist and definitely for the better.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|I haven't the slightest idea who this movie is supposed to be for.  Do the actors do a good job?  Yeah.  Are there unusual special effects and neato cinematography?  Yeah.  <BR>Are these characters people you can relate to and care about?<BR>Nope.<BR>I've a feeling that if the director met people like these characters in real life, he wouldn't care about them either.  He would exploit their pain instead.
B000067CPX|3.0|i've just bought this album and it is still new to me, so i haven't really had time to fall in love with it. being a fan of rhcp's old funky stuff, this album was a little disappointing. it is completely different from blood sugar sex magik...all the songs on here are mellow and resembles early beatles and beach boy tunes. it is really evident in this album that rhcp has changed their musical direction, but not for the worse. anthony's voice sounds really, really good and there are some cathcy tunes on this album, like \\"dosed.\\"  for people who fell in love with the wild funky rhcp, this album is going to take some getting used to. for those of you who really liked californication, i say, go and buy it. 3 stars.
B00000I924|4.0|I come to this CD with very little prior exposure to Jeff Beck.  Having said that, this is not a perfect disc, but after several listens, I like it a lot.  The music usually explores new or interesting directions while keeping the emotion in the mix.  The rare spoken-word add-ons are surplusage, more so than the similarly rare add-ons in Steve Stevens' solo album or the second Bozzio Levin Stevens album, but that is a minor point.  Six songs really make this disc for me: What Mama Said, Angel, Psycho Sam, Space for Papa, THX 138, and Declan (in probably that order).  The only song I would have dropped off the disc was Brush With the Blues.  Of course, I still let the song play when it comes up, rather than fast forward. <br />As for particular songs...<br />What Mama Said-the music and tempo kept me off center for the first several listens, but I am a big fan of this type of loud hard guitar sound, w/ a strong electronica influence;<br />Psycho Sam-tense, electronica influence, compelling, complex;<br />Brush With the Blues-A little more traditional blues rock, which is OK if you like that sort of thing.  Its not my mood;<br />Blast from the East-the rhythm guitar and some of the solos provide the \\"East\\" blast; the remainder is fairly standard midtempo guitar rock, reminiscent of some moments of John Paul Jones's Zooma album (though without the low tone crunch);<br />Space for Papa-bluesy, with a strong twangy electric guitar, a bit of swagger and very effective changes in tone and tempo;<br />Angel-loping, beautiful, long, jazzy, slow midtempo, with a tinge of electronica in the beats; the combination sounds a little more like Ry Cooder in his world music mode, with a shade of Indian (subcontinent, not American Indian) tones.  Really good.;<br />THX 138-a stronger electronica presence, faster paced, sustained guitar chords throughout, mixing effectively with the soloing.  The \\"swirling solos\\" and the relentless bass line made this song a standout for me;<br />Hip Notica-Not crazy about the title; slower song, not as emotionally effective as Angel, but not bad;<br />Even Odds-Mid tempo rock, strong bass line again; fair, but nothing that screamed for attention;<br />Declan-slow, weeping guitar with flute [!]; nice, emotional;<br />Another Place-slow, new age jazz guitar, rather short and inconsequential end to the disc; again, OK if you like that sort of thing.
B000002LQR|5.0|when i first got this album, i only liked about 3 songs on it. i didn't listen to it for a while. about 5 months later, i took it with me on vacation and started listening to it again, and i haven't put it down since. i seriously think it is the best cd i own.it truly captures the talent of this funky, sock wearing, california band.  there's something for everyone on it-funk, rap, rock...you name it, this album has it. if you like rhcp's new stuff like scar tissure and otherside, i must warn you that this is nothing like californiaction or their newest, by the way. it takes some getting used to if that's what you expect to hear from rhcp. i say go out and buy this album! if you don't like it you can always sell it. 5 stars!!
0871137380|5.0|I have lived in Africa for 30 years before moving to the USA. It is always difficult for me to explain the multiple facets of a complex continent like Africa. This book captures one of the facets I never understood: The complex and seemingly senseless violence and it's impact. I appreciate it that Mark presented views from both sides of the battle. It left me with an empathy for all the victims and a longing that the beauty of Africa will prevail over it's internal and external struggles.
B00000J7JO|4.0|rhcp's 8th album, this one is more pop than their others, with songs like &quot;scar tissue&quot; and the title track, &quot;californication.&quot; however, it still features some funkier songs, like &quot;i like dirt&quot; and &quot;right on time.&quot; although it is different from their other stuff, it's still a great album, and i recommend it to rhcp fans or people who re just trying them out. i give it 4 stars.
B000068R1X|1.0|This is correct, Sharon and Epic have done it again with putting new drum and bass parts in the album. All of the songs have different drum patterns in certain parts of the songs they are Not remixed. &quot;Now you see it now you dont&quot;,&quot;Rock n roll rebel&quot; have different drum sounds or altering of the beigining of a song, not like the original re-issues back in 95' which sounded normal. &quot;Centre of eternity&quot; the bells are not the ones on the original album. The title track is also different. Ozzy's vocals also echoed alot on the original album but not this one. Also in the booklet of credits it says all songs written by Ozzy. Nope.<BR>That's not true other people helped him. Its in the original album credits. Sharon and epic Ruined a heavy metal classic. Disgraceful to ruin a legend's work...
B000067CPX|3.0|I am the biggest fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  I saw them with Foo Fighters a couple years ago, and over any other concert I'ver ever seen, that was the best.  I love the song &quot;By the Way&quot; on this album.  That's about it.  Until now, I've loved every album by the Peppers.  I even like One Hot Minute.  Maybe I'm not used to their new style, but I think this album is very sad.  They turned pop.  The funk is gone.  Frusciante and Flea sing way too many harmonies.  I like their harmonies once in a while, but the highs don't fit.  This CD is packed with soft rock and One Hot Minute-style Peppers.  The Peppers used to be badass in your face rock and funk.  What happened?  I'm just hoping they treat this album like One Hot Minute on their tour.  The only song they should play on tour is &quot;By the Way&quot;.  I never thought I'd be disappointed by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  It's a sad thing.
B00000099Y|5.0|The correct spelling of the album is nima and yes I'd have to say that this is TOOL's greatest album. The only other thing that brings so much intillectual emotion is hearing Third-Eye and Push-it off of Salival. The lyrical persuasions put forth in Push-it are astounding. It is probably the most under-rated song on this cd. As I went through some of the first reviews of this cd and the later ones, nobody seemed to mention Push-it in any of their reviews. Some seemed to have put it aside along with all of the intro songs that set the mood with-in the cd. Just make sure you read the lyrics and have fun as the TOOL's tour begins this summer. I'll be seeing them at both shows in Illinois. Hopefully, there will be some new renditions on some of their songs as this is their second year of touring on Lateralus in the U.S. Now, don't forget how to swim.
B0000541AM|5.0|This is the most wonderful story I ever saw.<BR>I have seen this movie almost 35 times and will 65 times more.No questions asked.<BR>The first time I saw it I was 15 years old and probably is one of my 5 favorites until now. There are lots of stories created for a situation, but this theme is right from the streets.<BR>You can write a story in front of a computer and let your imagination runs, but is in the street where you can find best stories, I mean real one.<BR>Now I am 37 and everybody that see this movie today , feel the same emotion I felt years ago.
B000067CPX|5.0|Just got the CD and still absorbing the music.  But this is the best CD out this year.... The boys have topped Californication.  There may not be specific songs that are necessarilly better. But as a CD as a whole it is just fantastic! The styles, genres, emotion, subtly used is just amazing!...
B000067CPX|5.0|I bought this cd the day it came out and it is awesome. The melodies and chord progressions are professionally done. The Chili Peppers are definitely here to stay (or at least in my cd case).There are some new sounds on this album. While Flea's bass is still (and always will be) a prime element in their music, in 'Cabron' they introduce kind of an acoustic Mexican jig-type song, in 'On Mercury' it sounds like a 60's-Jamaican-pop melody,and in 'Warm Tape' it sounds kinda, well........I can't describe it. And finally,'Universally Speaking'reminds me of the Strokes. <BR>     And now for the big question...Is it better than Californication? The answer in my opinion is........yes.<br />By the Way-4 stars<BR>Universally Speaking-5 stars<BR>This is the Place-5 stars!! (personal favorite)<BR>Dosed-5 stars!! (personal favorite)<BR>Don't Forget Me-5 stars (personal favorite)<BR>The Zephyr Song-3.5 stars<BR>Can't Stop-1 star<BR>I Could Die for You-3.5 stars<BR>Midnight-1 star<BR>Throw Away Your television-1 star<br />Cabron-3.5 stars (exciting and original)<BR>Tear-5 stars!! (personal favorite)<BR>On Mercury-3.5 stars (Good Melody)<BR>Minor Thing-5 stars!! (personal favorite)<BR>Warm Tape-3.5 stars<BR>Venice Queen-4 stars
B00005OM4N|4.0|The anticipated third album from pop princess Britney Spears, earns 4 stars. The reason is because the CD isn't as successful as her last 2000 realease Oops!...I Did It Again. The songs arn't as catchy on this album as they were on the last two. Although Britney's new dance music get's you into a groove.
B00003CXTF|3.0|Ok, it was a great movie but the plot didn't fit the title very well. This movie was more of a love triangle. This movie wasn't based ONLY on Pearl Harbor. It was based on three people's lives. <br />Don't get me wrong it was an excellent movie, but...<BR>It took a long time to get to the main point of the movie, Pearl Harbor. <br />If this movie was based on Pearl Harbor, did it have to bring the story to Europe? The plot was more of a love story that involved the Pearl Harbor attack interfering with their love life. <br />The thrilling part didn't even come until more than half the movie went through. Now if the story based more, NOT on someone's love life then it would've been better. <br />This movie obviously didn't make sense to have the movie title. The plot should have stayed strictly on the two main characters and leave the girl out. That would've left a lot of action. <br />The attack affected the three, mostly in their love life. But they lost close friends also, but they cared more about their love life. My goodness... <br />What can I say? It's not all based on Pearl Harbor. That's what I'm trying to say here. If you wanna see Pearl Harbor check out Tora! Tora! Tora!
0316666343|5.0|I am not a religious person, nor a believer in the \\"hereafter\\", but I found this book to be so comforting, and so well constructed....the sadness of the main character's death is balanced by the influence she can still have on her loved ones, and the eventual \\"happy\\" ending for all of them.  I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially those who might have recently lost a loved one, or are perhaps facing their own personal crisis.  A gem.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|I love this movie! For once, I don't have to worry wasting my time watching another sequel of some other Disney movie. <br />This movie captures the kid in you and you can view what it's like in a kids perspective of being scared of monsters. <BR>The plot is excellent! They learned a lesson from one kid. <BR>The way that they show how monsters supposedly live is amazing. Who would ever think that it was a job and how they made a living? I never thought that they'd have competition in how many scares they make. And who knew that they were scared of touching humans?! <br />In this movie, the monsters have a change in heart. They finally understand that they don't have to scare to get their job done. They can keep kids happy with humor. And they are no longer scared of being close to humans. <BR>This movie has crazy antics along the way, adventure and will keep you laughing. It's a wonderful movie for all ages and a great family movie. No disappointment here!
B000002KZA|3.0|Depeche Mode's third album is symbolic of what the group was going through at that time in their career.  This is the first album that the group put out with member Alan Wilder.  This is also one of two albums in which Alan Wilder would get to compose his own lyrics.  Alan Wilder composed The Landscape is Changing and Two Minute Warning for this album.  That is a treat in itself since Martin Gore is the group's song writer following the departure of member Vince Clark.  This does not mean that Martin Gore isn't a good song writer.  He is a fantastic songwriter with a great voice, but it is also nice to experience the lyrics of another band member.<BR>This album is good though clearly not one of Depeche Mode's best works.  The album has some very good tracks like The Landcsape is Changing, Told You So and the all time classic hit Everything Counts.  Those three songs alone are the highlights of this album<BR>and also give you a slight taste of Depeche Mode's follow up and all time master piece Some Great Reward Album.  The other songs on the album are ok, none of which stand out.  Some songs are better than others and some like Shame and Pipeline are weak. Despite that this is still a good album to have in your collection, especially if you are a Depeche Mode fan.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool's newest album, &quot;Lateralus&quot;, is nothing short of amazing.  There is no way I could accurately explain this, and yet I'm trying anyway.  While the music is not over-the-top technical, it keeps you interested and never gets too simplistic.  Their experimentations with odd meters is just incredible.  How anyone can play like this and make it sound that good is beyond me.  Danny Carey is possibly the greatest drummer I've ever heard (except maybe Thomas Hakke, from Meshuggah).  His rhythms are so mind-bogglingly complex, I could never hope to play like this.  He practically defies the laws of physics.  Maynard's vocals are great, not quite godly, but unique and entrancing. I can almost sing like him, but I need a LOT of practice!<br />Favorite song?  Geez, how do I pick one?  I guess &quot;The Grudge&quot; is a great opener, and the &quot;Parbol/Parabola&quot; duo is mindblowing as well, but I don't think there's a single weak spot to be found here.  Oh, just so you know, this is not a &quot;sellout&quot; album, there is nothing even remotely radio-friendly on here.  This album's commercial success is a total fluke.  <br />The last track, &quot;Faaip de Oiad&quot; (that might be spelled wrong, but I really don't care :) is an odd track.  The numbers on your digital read-out go backwards from 2:00 before the song starts, and then you hear an odd recording of a guy being chased by aliens.  But everybody seems to have missed the point of this.  If you listen, in the background, Danny is doing an amazing drum solo.  This is befitting, Tool isn't the kind of band to do ostentatious solo spots, so they hide it behind weird sound samples.  Very &quot;Tool&quot; of them, heh.<br />See, this is why I don't like to review my favorite albums, I end up going on and on, and the review is too long.  Just buy this, it's amazing.  Tool's best, and that says a lot.
1558908420|5.0|This is one of the best police movies I have ever seen.  It is very realistic and a down to earth cop movie.  There aren't a bunch of crazy stunts or anything like that.  It's just cops doing their jobs.  Stallone is the man in this flick and I have seen this movie numerous times.  If anyone is interested in police work or any type of cop film this is the one...
0517118297|1.0|This review is regarding the quality of the 1994 hardcover edition published by Grammercy. I ordered this edition several weeks ago and was extremely disappointed to find it was poor quality. The binding is acceptable when new but after a week of light use, I already noticed deterioration on the front binding. Actually the binding is so poor that, if not careful, you could easily tear some of the front pages out. The paper quality is cheap and is the same used for mass media paperbacks expect slightly thinner. Overall, I was so dissatisfied with this edition that I returned it.<br />However, I would also like to make a recommendation. After returning the book, I was still looking for collection of Austen's works and happened to find a 1995 hardcover edition of this exact book by Grammercy. The edition costs five dollars more but the quality is ten times better. The book has a faux leather cover with gold trimmed pages and a ribbon bookmark. The paper quality in thin but polished, smoother and more refined. The binding is very durable and I have noticed no deterioration yet after a week of use.<br />If I had to a chance to redo my purchases, I would have skipped this edition completely and ordered the 1995 edition. If your interested in this edition, it can be found using search under ISBN # 0517147688
B00005BJ2O|5.0|The cdking really got it right in the song-by-song review.  This is a great CD, especially if you loved the movie.  Many of the songs on here are better than their original versions.  MacGregor does a better job than Elton John on &quot;Your Song,&quot; in my opinion, giving it a new life.  &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; is impossible not to sing along to.  Rufus Wainwright gives us a beautiful, elegantly-sung &quot;Confessions de la Butte.&quot;  I didn't think that too much was left out, unlike others, because the key music is all here.  I highly reccommend this, especially if you are open to new renditions of great music.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|I like B-movies. I hunt them down, I MST3K them, and from that standpoint Blade 2 was pretty good. There's little plot, some sharp and funny dialogue, and some more of the hack fest that the first one offered. All in all the film is very enjoyable, and good for a laugh. The problem is that I'm not so sure that was the intent of the film.<br /> Blade is still a shallow and two-dimensional character, and bringing Whistler back when I was under the impression that he shot himself in the head with a silver bullet in the first one seemed kind of gimmicky, and cheap in the vain of the Search for Spock. I hate it when they bring dead people back to life in sequels. Never the less a lot of the better moments of this film were courtesy of Whistler and his interaction with Scud.<br /> If you're looking for a deep movie with a lot of character development then look somewhere else. The love interest is barely noticeable, you see Blade and Neesa eyeing each other but it never gets any further than that, which does not justify the tragic romantic ending by any means. Never the less B movies are not about plot, or character, that's why they call them B-movies, and that's what Blade 2 really is. Something that the original film failed to do. The movie is stupid, but still manages to be a lot of fun at the same time, despite some painfully CGI fights scenes that were absolutely unnecessary. People on wires look better!
B000002I6T|4.0|I try to offer another viewpoint, as most of the reviews already glowingly praise this cd.<br />I am in full accordance, but my perspective is a bit different. I am oriented towards Brasilian/Latin ,Jazz and European traditional sounds, as well as Doowops and funk, and variations on those themes-rock musics isnt really my branch..<br />I DID listen to rock, and even appreciated it for the small window of opportunity where it was vital, creative and intriguing, EVEN if sometimes rough edged and/or limited melodically or in its  HARMONIC limitations.<br />David Crosby in particular,( and Crosby Stills Nash and Young) intrigued me more than most \\"rock\\" bands that  had reached WIDE COMMERCIAL ACCEPTANCE. While CSN  occasionally embraced blues based \\"rock & roll guitar hero\\" forms and occasional quase-R & B/Latin pretentions, each individual musician of the \\"collective\\" brought loftier goals- the  winding 3 & 4 part  harmonies  and introspective melodies. Most important to me, were David Crosby's contributions to the group,though he and Graham Nash are musical \\"twins\\" at times,and really make some nice musics together.<br />His muse was seemingly inspired quite a bit from BeBop and modal Jazz, and  also  folkloric musics mixed with rock passions and his \\"guerilla\\" political leanings.<br />Delivered in a beautiful haunting tenor voice  or a passionate soulful cry, this is<br />combined with  better than average \\"open chord\\" voicings (and tunings)  on acustic guitar -- this is what  that most attracted me to the David Crosby sounds...<br />The most important facet to this cd, I feel, is the tasteful musicianship and RESTRAINT he was able to achieve from his San Francisco and Los Angeles based sidemen/women, ALL rock and roll heroes of the time .<br />Jerry Garcia , in particular sounds the best I ever heard him, playing more cogently in brief spaces,DENIED the room for his usual meandering \\"pseudo-jazzy\\" noodling he is  much BELOVED for with Greatful Dead!<br />  Though for me, the blues based guitar fills get a bit tedious on many songs within the cd, I am sure MOST who LIKE this style of guitar will rather enjoy it!<br />( but I think Garcia's pedal steel fills, as always, are quite good!)<br />My feeling- it is Crosby who takes the show with his vocals, and thoughtful compositions.<br /> D.C. is right up there with Terry Callier, Shawn Phillips, Nick Drake, Tim Buckley, etc etc etc, that \\"school\\" of  singer/songwriter who have a palette of watercolors to paint beautiful soundpictures from, as opposed to the weak-kneed CRAP the music industry tries to sell us<br /> grazzi mille David Crosby!, the blues based guitar fills get a bit tedious on many songs within the cd, I am sure MOST who LIKE this style of guitar will rather enjoy it! <BR>( but I think Garcia's pedal steel fills, as always, are quite good!)<br />My feeling- it is Crosby who takes the show with his vocals, and thoughtful compositions.<br /> D.C. is right up there with Terry Callier, Shawn Phillips, Nick Drake, Tim Buckley, etc etc etc, that \\"school\\" of  singer/songwriter who have a palette of watercolors to paint beautiful soundpictures from, as opposed to the weak-kneed CRAP the music industry tries to sell us <BR> grazzi mille David Crosby!
B000067CPX|2.0|For over 16 years, I have been anxiously awaiting the new releases from the RHCP.  With each release I am ecstatic at the quality and originality of funk, jazz, rock, and rap they are ale to fuse into classic hits.  However, this time I am extremely disappointed at their decision to go with much slower songs and drop the heavy funk that built their popularity for years.  Other than the title track, the cd might be good for those long road trips to put the kids to sleep. This album is definitely NOT what you would expect from the band after all these years.
B000067CPX|5.0|These guys are incapable of making bad (and for that matter, mediocre) albums.  You know it.  I know it.  So go get this.  Certainly the Chili Peps have gotten mellower as each new album has come out.  The trend continues here.  The funk is almost nonexistent.  Doesn't matter.  These songs are beautiful.  Standout tracks are \\"Universally Speaking\\" and \\"I Could Die For You\\" is absolutely breathtaking.  Go pick up this gem.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is one excellent album. I can emphasize that enough. You know those albums where you are caught listening to the whole thing without having to skip a song? Well, this CD is the case. It is still inside my CD player, since the day I puchased this CD. It's amazing. Avril is a true artist. Go out and get yourself a copy or you will be missing out on real music.
B000067CPX|5.0|When I first popped \\"By the Way\\" into my cd player, I was shocked. I was expecting to hear the funky, hard rockers that I've been a fan of since \\"Mother's Milk\\". Instead what I got was melodic, deep songs. I was mad at first, thinking that the cd was not very good, but then I listened to it again, now knowing what to expect. I realized that this album is great. Imagine songs like \\"This Velvet Glove\\" from \\"Californication\\" on a whole album. <BR> Songs like \\"Tear\\" and \\"Midnight\\"(especially the first 30 seconds of this song) make the album great. These songs represent the mood and quality of the album. Although \\"Universally Speaking\\" \\"Cabron\\" \\"The Zephyr Song\\" are silly sounding, the rest of the album compensates for their failures. So, pick up the cd and see what you think of the new Chili Peppers.
B000067CPX|4.0|It's a nice work, but i must say it's the same style as Californication.  But in my opinion, this isn't bad at all, since they are somehow still trying out &quot;new&quot; things, even though they must have done about everything by now.<br />I had downloaded an mp3 of the &quot;By the way&quot; title track (before the actual cd-release), and was very much disappointed.  But then I just said to myself &quot;whatever, the rest will be better&quot;, and guess what, even this track is much better on cd than the mp3 i had downloaded.  (in the end, don't judge from that bad mp3 i'd say)
B000063DFN|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT POWERSLAVE. IT WAS MY FIRST MAIDEN ALBUM BACK IN 85, AND I CONSIDER THIS ALBUM THE BEST METAL ALBUM OF ALL TIME.IF YOU ARE AN OLD SCHOOL METAL FAN LIKE MYSELF, I AM SURE YOU HAVE THIS ALBUM, BUT IF YOU HAVE NOT HEARD IT THEN DO NOT HESITATE BECAUSE THIS THE ULTIMATE MASTERPIECE OF ALL TIME. CHECK OUT 2 MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT, BACK IN THE VILLAGE POWERSLAVE, ACES HIGH AND THE 13 MINUTE EPIC OF RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER TO MENTION A FEW. BUY IT, THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST.
B000067CPX|5.0|This a great CD from a great band. They continue to impress and excel as they evolve musically. Buy it you won't regret it.
0060506989|5.0|An excellent review by two men who were there.  Both of them are heros.  If you want a picture of the beginning of the Viet Nam war, get and read this book.  It's just an absolutely amazing story of grit and perserverance.  Col. Harold Moore was a wonderful leader of men.  Galloway was the only reporter that experienced the full horror of the battle.  You won't be able to put the book down.  These men have been interviewed on radio...their story is just incredible.  It breaks my heart that we lost so many because of foolishness of the higher command.
B00003CXXP|4.0|Artificial Intelligence is not the warm fuzzy family fare early trailers would have led its audience to expect.  It is not merely the retelling of Pinocchio, although comparisons to Pinocchio are inevitable.  Neither is it merely the postmodern fantasy of a director of the surreal.<br />Artificial Intelligence is a Siddartha-esque journey film, a story of a quest for identity and the meaning of life, and to a lesser degree, the documentary of some of the more important symbols of our cultural understanding of those questions.  The film's design and cinematographics draw from the dark and beautiful tradition of Blade Runner, while the semiotics put comparisons to The Fisher King in mind.<br />Was it good?  If you are the kind of person who likes to read Joseph Campbell and rummage for meaning in the junkyard of contemporary film, you'll love this movie.  Otherwise, you'll be fascinated or repulsed depending on your personal aesthetic.  Either way, it's worth seeing at least once, even if you're not going to include it in your dissertation.
B00005K3OT|1.0|Heavy-handed dreck about a woman who brings &quot;enlightenment&quot; (through libertine ideas and the metaphor of confections) to the supposedly close-minded rubes of a small French village. I watched it for the scenery, but even that small hope went largely unsatisfied.<br />I suppose it's a wonderful little fable for those who were born in the 60's and got stuck in perpetual adolescence.
B000000WF9|5.0|This is one of the best music soundtracks I have heard in all my life, the only one that rivals this besides Nyman's own other works is the Star Wars Episode II soundtrack. Nyman has done wonders again, and you just cant go wrong with his work on a soundtrack. The songs are deep, touching, mellow, and curious all at once. <br />I am no music analyst, but when you hear something good, you have to write about it and give it the credit the soundtrack deserves. Any of the movies Nyman has wrote a composed a soundtrack for are wonderful examples of how to include music with plot (Ravenous, Drowning By Numbers, and more) and this is no exception. Buy it, and never take it out of your car's cd player!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Of course we need to thank to JA for the letter, but we should also thank to Root&amp;HInds and to the rest of the cast and the members of the production to bring us this great film. Ture it is not like American S&amp;S and Emma that reflects humor and that are glorious/bright/colorfull...<BR>But the British(Europeans) have their own way of doing films and Persuasion from casting to directing reflects such distinct elements which you either love or hate. Gladlly I love all. Casting is perfect, maybe sister Elizabeth might have been little more attractive, but alas...<BR>After watching this you would definetly would like to see more of Root and Hinds. They may look older than what we thought of such ages in our century but remeber this is early 19th century and people especially in Navy would not look like our ordinary 30 somethings of 1990's. <BR>The director/screenwriter took a liberty with the text for sure, but I like it and saw it neccessary to do justice to the story on big screen. Many scenes/conversations reflects its time and ever-changing conditions of the falling aristocracy in 19th Century England. <BR>But mostly the cahnging attitude and appearance of the leading characters were most appealing. Anna's transformation from the start to the end of the film captured perfectly.<BR>It will be hard to understand at first: Read the book; Watch and listen the film closely; Use closed-caption...<BR>It will be worth it
B000002AEN|5.0|I first heard John Hurt on record after his resurgence in the early '60's, and I liked him, but not enough to own him. I never heard his 1928 songs until this week, when I bought this reasonably priced but quality pressing. Fairly labeled as more \\"folkie\\" than raw blues, John's 13 songs on this disc are all entertaining. Considering the age of the material, the sound quality is great. His guitar accompaniment is amazing. Most of these were recorded Christmas week of '28 in New York City, in two sessons seven days apart ... Read the other reviews, listen to the song samples, and send in your sawbuck for this one if you care about important American music. John is easy on the ears, but \\"authentic\\" as it gets. The one caveat is that his song \\"Nobody's Dirty Business\\" seems to treat domestic violence, even the fatal kind, casually. (My job, when not reviewing for Amazon, is to persuade people to end that stuff.) If John presented this one with cold anger, it would be offensive...but I can't help but believe he had his tongue in his cheek ... Don't take the lyrics as \\"advice\\", just enjoy the performance of that number. Overall, this is a great bunch of songs, and represents an exciting moment in the history of recorded music.
B0000508U6|4.0|Everybody's always comparing poor Coldplay to Travis and Radiohead. Please. Stop. They're a good band on their own merits. Parachutes is a strong album lyrically and musically. Maybe they're not breaking much new ground, but it's hard to find a rock album these days where there are no throwaway tracks and this is one of them. Oh, and Yellow is my least favorite song on the album, so do give it a fair chance even if you don't like Yellow.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This film has &quot;INDESCRIBABLE&quot; written all over it.  That means I truly cannot tell you in words how personally this movie affected me and how emotional it was.  The acting was at it's utmost superb point.  Haley-Joel Osment is a show stealer and the feeling is tremendous that he gives you.  He makes you believe exactly what the film is trying to do, make a robot who can truly love.  He feels like a robot but at the same time feels real.  It's weird, but it's true and worked out perfectly.  THe skill that went into this acting and directing of Spielberg could never be topped.  Following the storyboards and story by Kubrick, Spielberg wrote his own screenplay that turned out wonderful.<br />The film drew tears from my eyes and was one of the most emotional films I have ever seen.  John Williams score is beautiful and heartwarming and has mixes of fear and mellowness and sadness, truly a wonderful mix.<br />This is another classic example of a film done by Spielberg where the visual effects look tremendously real and are set-up to make you believe they are real sets.  It's all the way he trickily sets up the shots, that's where his perfection comes.<br />The ending to this movie is a mix of eternal happiness for the characters yet sadness for the audience, and it left me in buckets of tears (I mean that truly).  It's a great film and anyone who dares to show their disrespect for it has serious problems.
B000065VA1|5.0|This was one of the first CDs I ever owned and is still one of my favorite albums ever. The tracks span from fun and poppy (Sledgehammer, Big Time) to just beautiful and sublime. It doesn't take a genius to know that In Your Eyes is a fantastic song, but I really think everything on the album is just as strong. Some of it's just a little more subtle. Especially Mercy Street (somewhat based on work by the poet Anne Sexton). Mercy Street is better than you think. Go on, play it again. Oh, but to do that you have to buy the album. What are you waiting for??
B00003CXI1|5.0|This film is an event for people of all ages.  It's imagination is brought to life by director Chris Colombus.  He does a splendid job in directing the children, as he does in all his movies.  The story takes a real twist at the end, as all novel readers know, but the film itself is appreciateable in it's humor that is given off by the great child actors.<br />The child acting, at some points, only falls down to decent, but most of the time is terriffic.  The visuals tend to lack at points, the troll, who is supposed to be about five tons, looks weightless because it's computer generated imagery doesn't seem completed.  I believe visual effects teams will improve that in the future though.<br />Of course, John Williams blows us away with his Oscar nominated score and left people of all ages humming the theme as they left the theater.  It was memorable and me and my friends counted how many times we got chills in the theater just from the exciting score.<br />It's an exciting movie, full of suprises, absolutely great acting, and one to be considered an all-time classic.  It lives up to the book and I sometimes find it scary how the artists of this film managed to depict the characters exactly how I imagined them when I read the book.  It is overwhelming how they truly bring J.K. Rowling's vision to life.  And, I have seen the poster for Chamber of Secrets, and Dobby is exactly the way I imagined him.  These artists freak me, but I love them for it.  Splendid job, great film, definetly see it if you haven't.  And don't bother renting it, just buy it, cause it's worth every penny.
0790749815|5.0|\\"North by Northwest\\" is Alfred Hitchcock's followup to 1958's moody \\"Vertigo.\\"  While it's not as \\"deep\\" as the latter film, \\"N by NW\\" is a first-rate action/mystery film that stands as one of the greatest films of all time.  The ever-suave Cary Grant and the striking Eva Marie Saint star in a movie that has all the elements we've come to expect from Hitch: mistaken identity, the intriguing blonde, murder, and deception.  And let's not forget the script, which is pregnant with witty one-liners and dodges cliches at all costs.  I wasn't around in 1959, but watching a movie like this in the theatre had to have been such an incredible experience.  You are literally hooked from the first frame.  The DVD itself is an attractive affair.  The picture is the best-looking I've ever seen in a Hitchcock movie.  In another review, I stated that \\"Vertigo\\" is the only film by Hitch available in 5.1 surround sound.  I was wrong!  \\"N by NW\\" is also in 5.1, and while the sound won't necessarily rock your system, it's a pretty decent soundtrack for a movie this old.  So, what are you waiting for?  I saw this on a friend's recommendation, and I'm kicking myself for not discovering it sooner.  \\"North by Northwest\\" is action filmmaking at its absolute peak and should not be missed.  I repeat: it's one of the greatest films of all time.
6304806426|5.0|The English Patient is one of the best films I have seen.It has a plot that is complex and mesmerizing.<BR> I quote some words from TIME magazine in it's excellent article,THE BEST CINEMA OF 1996 in which this picture was # 1 for that year:For many European wanderlusters who found an Eden in the Sahara, the desert was a woman-dazzling, enveloping. In such a place the hungarian aristocrat Count Almasy(Fiennes) finds his ideal desert woman(Scott Thomas) and follows her to hell. He then lives, just barely, to tell to a ministering angel( Binoche) who can give him what he needs: not absolution but understanding.The lovers,Fiennes, all coiled sexiness, threat shrouded in hauteur and Kristin Scott Thomas,who has the gift of making intelligence erotic,come together in a dance of doom that is abrasive,mysterious,powerful,inevitable. Minghella's beautiful film gets the rapture right, with a scope and intimacy rarely seen on film since the David Lean days.<BR>This review in my opinion perfectly expresses the appeal and greatness of this beautiful film.
B000025JVY|5.0|As so many others have already pointed out, this album is a very unique masterpiece. Nothing else sounds like it. It combines brutally intense drums with sweeping keyboards, pounding bass lines and Burchill's unique guitar style.<br />'Kick inside of me' is a very special gem of its time, supplying raw power in measures that make Metallica sound like a preschool band:)<br />I also recommend to listen to the extended version of 'Speed your love to me', which goes way beyond what the album version of the song delivers.
0380820846|3.0|I have read and enjoyed all of Julia Quinn's previous books.  The Bridgerton Series quickly became one of my favorites.  But, I must say I was disappointed by &quot;Romancing Mister Bridgerton.&quot; Colin and Penelope were more interesting characters in the previous Bridgerton stories.  In &quot;Romancing Mister Bridgerton&quot; their characters are one dimensional and lackluster.  They never really matured as a couple.  Even the romance in this story has been glossed over and barely mentioned.  Too much time was given to the history of the other stories and not enough time in developing a true love story for Colin and Penelope.  Penolope's love for Colin never developed beyond the girlish infatuation of a teenager, nor did she ever become comfortable in her new role as Colin's love interest.  I did not view Penolope as the &quot;witty and clever&quot; 28 year old woman she was supposed to be because she stammered throughout the whole book and always seemed unsure of herself.
0792838068|4.0|I found this movie both funny and sad. I laughed at what a drunken [fool] the guy makes out of himself in public and at first I also found some humor in how much he drinks. He drinks in the shower, in the car, in the morning, at night, fills a whole shopping cart full of liquor, etc. But as the movie progresses, showing how serious his problem is, it's not funny anymore.<br />So Ben the drunk has had his wife leave him already because of his drinking and now he gets fired. These loses in his life were probably both a factor in his continuing downward spiral and also a symptom of a greater problem. What exactly, his problem is, we never really find out. So he decides to go to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. There, he meets and develops a close relationship with a prostitute Sera. <br />It was interesting how the two maintained a fairly strong relationship despite his insane drinking and the way she makes a living. She, by the way, moved to Vegas because there's more money there for prostitutes. We see sad scenes of her getttin abused physically and sexually in her job, so we understand that she too, while better off than him, is not living a happy life either. I felt bad for her especially in that scene where she is basically gang raped in a hotel room. Her job is risky enough, going into a room with an unknown man for sex. I felt she shouldn't have gone into one with several men there, and should always carry on her some type of weapon like a gun or even just brass knuckles-- anything. But, for 200 bucks an hour untaxed at a self-chosen job, she doesn't have the right to complain. <br />They call it love, and if it was, then it was love at first sight. Right from the beginning she treated him differently than her usual customer and she even spent the night at his motel, which she soon pulls him from, enjoining him to live with her. <br />Their relationship is based upon unconditional love; they accept one another as they are without even asking them to change.Ben even told her early on that she must never ask him to stop drinking. She does tearfully beg him to see a doctor, citing that this is the one and only thing she asks of him, which he won't do. He eventually drinks himself to death and the movie is slightly narrated by her comments to a therapist about the relationship. I kept hoping that since they love each other, she will try to help him and he will try to stop drinking since she gives him something to live for and he wouldn't want to hurt her. I kept hoping that they would \\"leave las vegas\\", that place that seems to both degenerate people and attract degenerates according to the movie, and they would live a happy life as a couple Apparently, his alcoholism was stronger than his love for her. While many people in her position would have tried stopping him from committing suicide, she was unselfish. She needed him desperately, out of loneliness and despair, yet she let him have his own choice. Of course the high difficulty if not impossibility of stopping him probably influenced her indifference of action. He was determined on his course. It's just so sad, all that happened to her and especially him. And more than that, it's sad to what happened to them as a couple. They seemed to have something special between them, but it would not last.
0792837614|3.0|Despite the length of the movie, the relationship that develops between Maria and Tony does seem a little rushed.  But if you're looking for a realistic plot, this is not the movie to watch.  &quot;West Side Story&quot; invites the audience to witness the ongoing feud between the Jets and the Sharks, &quot;hoodlums&quot; in '50's NYC.  Choreography and music are great -- loved the opening sequence.  Some parts seem a little cheesy but were entertaining nonetheless.  A few particular scenes absolutely stood out and glowed, owing their magic to the actors' chemistry.  Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood do a great job.  A classic must-see!
B000067G3C|5.0|Remember that Simpsons episode where Homer loops a videotape of him and the guys working while they goof off \\"I saw this in a movie where there was a bus and it had to keep it's SPEED above 50 and if it's SPEED dropped, the bus would explode! I think it was called: The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down!\\" Even Homer realises the cleverness of Jan De Bont's tautly-directed action thriller.<br />Starring Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Dennis Hopper and Jeff Daniels, Speed is one of those rare films that comes along every now and then that proves to be better than standard fare. Essentially one big extended action scene, the film's frenetic pace makes up for the frequent plot holes. The action never lets up, creating suspense- filled set-pieces and audience excitement. The premise of a bomb on a bus that wil explode if the speed goes below 50 makes for one far-fetched but fun thrill ride.<br />Keanu is the quintessential gum-chewing cool guy action hero Jack Traven who, along with Annie Porter (Bullock) tries not to get blown up by a bomb that retired cop Howard Payne (Hopper) has set on the bus to get money. The entire principal cast are great, especially Hopper, whose character is reminiscent of his crazy bad guy in Red Rock West (1992). With lines like \\"Poor people are crazy Jack, I'm eccentric\\", Hopper manages to give a good performance during his rather short screen time. Plus the added quality of the always-good Daniels is first-rate. And Keanu, now best known for The Matrix, is equally cool here.<br />Jan DeBont's direction makes the film a taut, entertaining action ride, and surprisingly, Bullock manages to change from nervy bus passenger to a strong character by the film's conclusion. And the pulse-driven score creates even more tension and excitement. But the film is not perfect, it's predictable at times and things get rather tedious at the end, with yet another gasping of \\"The track's not finished!\\" Minor quibbles aside, the action is impressive, and Jan DeBont's visual stylishness gives a really eye-catching look. This action-fest is one of the best.<br />The DVD extras are amazing, with commentaries from De Bont and the crew, extended scenes, Easter Eggs (DVD Credits, Airline Version of Bus Crash), \\"Inside Speed Featurettes on the location, stunts and visual effects\\", production Design, the original Screenplay, action Sequence Featurettes on the \\"Bus Jump\\" and \\"Metro Rail Crash\\", Multi-Angle Shots with Audio, Multi-Stream Storyboards, an interview Archive with Keanu Reeves and the cast, trailers, 11 TV Spots and production notes.

B000066NW0|4.0|The tunes on this album are catchy and car-friendly.  I didn't like the ballads as much as the more uptempo songs but generally, not a bad album.  More mellow than I thought it would be -- Avril Lavigne has one of those voices that you don't get irritated listening to: it's not exactly flawless singing but something about it gives her character.  I also recommend Angela Ammons.
B000068TPN|5.0|If you are looking for a movie that is losely based on a true story this isn't it.  No added fictional story line and it doesn't need it. This is just about the one battle and about true heroism. Shows us what our service men and women go through for us despite the politics. Mel Gibson does it again.
B00005YTFG|5.0|Great direction, visuals, and songs.  \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is an offbeat, sometimes dark, but charming musical.  The beginning of the movie is somewhat of a visual orgy, but as the movie progresses, audiences are introduced to the growing romance between Satine and Christian.  As they fall deeper in love, their relationship becomes more forbidden accordingly.  Jim Broadbent does a great job as Zidler; his facial expressions are comical and grotesque in an almost paradoxical way.  Emotions are captured onscreen flawlessly.  I definitely recommend this movie for anyone who would be delighted to see Ewan McGregor burst into song on a giant elephant.
B000067CPX|5.0|I have always loved the chili peppers albums, their early albums sound like they look live.  they're amazing and i love them.  their newest cd, By The Way, is completely different from anything they've done, or anything I've heard from anyone else recently.  And I totally love it!!  beautiful songs, I think the thing that makes it stand out so much in my head is the remarkably beautiful backing vocals and harmonies.  buy this album and listen to it with and OPEN MIND, especially if you were an old chili peppers fan and only like fast pop-bass funk punk rock with crazy lyrics.
B000068QY7|5.0|OK. I know and love Oasis' music, when I heard about the new album I thought &quot;all right&quot;, the first single though didn't exactly leave me expecting a miracle. It was good, (hindu times this is), but not as good as I know Oasis is capable of. But despite expectations (or a lack of them) I, like a good little fan, waited outside of my music store for the doors to open so I could run in and purchase HEATHEN CHEMISTRY the day it was released. <br />I popped my new purchase in my cd player as soon as I'd made it outa the mall and began listening. It was strange, as the cd played every song after the hindu times was better than the single. Well, as you can probably imagine I was tickled pink (or a shade close to pink). <br />All I can say is good job there Noel (whom I really do love), I guess I should say the same to Liam so.. &quot;good job Liam&quot;... But I personally think oasis would be just as good as today if Noel sung, all the time. But oh well, Liam has a pretty decent voice. Of course I am biased so we'll leave it at that. <br />Oasis did an excellent job on this album, I am really glad they've made it so far and left us with such great music. I plan on savoring this one till one day we get more from one of the best bands in the world. <br />Enjoy!
B000067CPX|5.0|Hello I am the first person to review this album, it is good and unique, more mellow, and is full of well thought out music.<br />Goodbye<BR>CAH
B000067CPX|5.0|This cd is out of this world!! I have been anxiously awaiting the release of this cd, the RHCP are one of the greatest bands out there, Anthony Kiedis is so amazing, and beyond that there's these incredible guitars being played by mastermind John Frusciante and Flea, but driving it all is the percussive stylings of Chad Smith. Anyway, this group of musicians is tighter than ever on this album, even better than Californication. <br />One thing though, I think there might be just a little bit of scorn over the bands lack of really hardcore songs on this cd (at least by those who live for the tougher side of the Peppers). Personally I love every song and can't imagine a better line up. I guess if you want the more hardcore stuff go for Blood Sugar Sex Magic or something.<br />Anyway it is pretty noteworthy that some bands can hardly pull 10 songs in a row that are decent, most bands cut a cd with around 12 songs or so, and usually (at least with a lot of new stuff) about 4 of those songs are throw-aways, leaving a list of about 8 good songs. NOT SO with BY THE WAY, this 16 track cd doesn't bore or contain a single filler song. This amazes me more than anything. Each song sounds like it was written to be a single, it kind of reminds me of a greatist hits album, every song is just SO DAMN GOOD! <br />Ok, seeing that the music speaks for itself anyway and I've rambled enough, I've just gotta say I hope everyone out there is enjoying this album and listening to it 24/7. Awesome Awesome Awesome. I can't even pick a favorite, is it Dosed? or Cabron? hmmm... could be On Mercury.. I guess I'll have to listen to it a few more thousand times before I decide... oh darn. <br />Anyway, ENJOY!!
B00003CXI1|2.0|this was a good movie. however if you are looking for an excellent companion for the book, this is not it. the book is so much better than this adaption of the movie, that it makes the movie look terrible in comparison. too much of important character elements were left out in order for certain jokes to make sense to anybody other than those that had read the book. when i walked out of the theater i was thoroughly disapointed by the fact that if you hadnt read the book, there wouldve been no way to understand the movie. this movie in itself had good special effects but when compared to the masterful effects written by j.k. rowling, they  look pathetic. if you are a die hard fan of the book, i do not reccommend the movie
0316666343|5.0|I was torn between not wanting to put this book down and not wanting it to end. You don't want to put it down because it is so gripping but you also want to take your time so you can absorb every word!!!  Reading this book, you feel so much a part of the Salmon family - everything that happens to this family affects you too. I cried with them, rejoiced with them and felt all their fears and frustrations. In the end I breathed a sigh of relief that everything would be ok with this family. I would give it a 10 if I could!
B00005MP58|5.0|If there is a pinnacle for movies, in particular, mini-series, than this must be it. After seven years of absolutely savoring this film, I still get goose-bumps when Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennet finally, and at long last, share a kiss. Having read the book for the first time at the age of twelve, and then rereading it countless times since, I have become ingrained with each characters' personality. So much so, that if this version had been miscast, I would have been up in arms. As it is, it is like the producer, director, casting director, and costume designer gazed into my own imagination and made what I had envisioned into this one, perfect movie. The two main roles, played by Colin Firth(Darcy) and Jennifer Ehle(Elizabeth)are so accurate that it is as if Miss Austen had reappeared to inspire them. Mr. Firth, in particular, gives Darcy such depth and interest that I would not wish it on any future actor to even attempt reviving the part. Miss Ehle transmits through Lizzy, humour, warmth, passion, and a believable sensitivity without being too sweet. The rest of the cast is also excellent. The music is true to the times, as is the dancing. The countryside is gorgeous, the homes exquisite. All in all, a classic interpretation of a true classic.
0446677450|1.0|The book was interesting story about his life but thats all it seem to be about. There was only one thing I learned from this book. All you have to do is tell people how rich you supposedly are, and how you want to help them. Forget any original ideas, just repeat the same general ideas over and over again and people will buy it. The one thing I like about this author is how he can turn a couple well known ideas that would take a paragraph or two to explain, and turn it into 200 pages is amazing. So I probably will never get rich off of his general and vague financial advice, but I now know how to become a best selling author.
0800179501|1.0|What's the deal releasing this movie on full screen? It's a classic film that I've seen about 100 times but I will not be buying this DVD, until it gets what it deserves. Widescreen, commentaries, deleted scenes? Come on, I expect so much more. Until then I'll stick with my VHS copy.
B00005JKED|4.0|This is a excellent movie that could have been dangerously bad had anyone else had the lead rolls.  Denzel Washington plays one of the best bad &quot;good guys&quot; in recent history and Ethan Hawke works well with his over the top counterpart.<br />What makes this movie work is Hawke's right and wrong perspective of the world and how it is slowly shattered by Washington's good guy gone bad cop.  Washington, lets the character grown in the course of one day, only going over the top when it is truly needed.  His soft spoken to explosiveness gives his character the insanity needed.<br />The deleted scenes were interesting, but would not have changed the movie all that much.<br />This is one of the few times the Acadamey made the right choice for Best Actor.
B000068QY7|5.0|After the last two offerings, you'd be forgiven for thinking twice before buying Heathen Chemistry. Well don't. It's no coincidence that the first line of the album is &quot;I get up when I'm down&quot;. This is exactly what they've done. Oasis have drawn together the raw sound of Definitely Maybe (Hung in a bad place, Better man),the sheer quality of Morning Glory (Forces of Nature, Stop crying your heart out, Little by Little)and they're new-found maturity to produce a tremendous album.<BR>What's more is that Oasis have produced a new sound-something critics claimed Oasis were not able to do. In the gentle Songbird and thoughtful She is Love, Oasis have become all folksy- complete with clapping hands.<BR>What is really impressive is that there is not a bad track on the album. It is the most all-round, mature album Oasis have produced to date.<BR>However, the last word has to be left for Born on a different cloud- written by Liam!. It's an instant classic with the epic atmosphere of Champagne Supernova.<BR>Buy it now- your money will not be wasted.
B00005OWEG|3.0|Apocolypse now is an excellent movie.  Very few people would argue this, but the Redux, which adds 40 minutes to a movie already 2 hours long, is over doing it.  some of the scenes added do indeed enhance the movie, but most are generally unnessecary and don't add much to the film, or draw out the story with meanlingless blather that doesn't even serve to enhance character development.  If you have a DVD remote and can skip the scenes that were added that detract from the overall film, great, other wise get the VHS and pray they release the original cut.
B00005ATZT|5.0|This is one of the greatest Harrison Ford movies.  In this movie it shows the struggle of what happens and what you feel like when you are accussed falsely.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Well, not really, but the movie is excellent if you enjoy campy, b-horror zombie flicks.  It's chicks with guns, lots of bullets, and the walking dead.  Oh how I loathe the undead...  Anyhoo, if you are looking for riveting plot or stellar acting <SMACK>, what is wrong with you?  It's a zombie movie.  In fact, the only thing wrong with this movie is that it is based on a video game and yet the movie is still actually good.  A sign of the apocolypse for sure.  Excellent action scenes, killer soundtrack, solid b-movie performances.  Lots of fun.<br />Oh, and for the hard core RE favs out there, this movie was originally entitled Resident Evil 0, as it was a prequel to the games explaining how the whole nightmare got started.  It keeps the same prequel plot, but thankfully chucks the bad title out the window.
B000067CPX|5.0|This is a great summer CD. By The Way may be a few songs too long, but overall it is one of the better Chili Pepper albums I've heard in a LONG time. Thank god they finally got away from the whole rap/rock thing!!
B0000065O1|5.0|I'm not a big video tape excerciser, but I have tried a bunch.  This is, by far, my absolute favorite for the following reasons.  1)Cindy is a real person working out with you.  She gets a bit winded in parts, she tells you to \\"take advantage of these breaks, guys\\" and she basically is an empathetic friendly presence.  She does a good job at reminding you about form as well.  2) It's really hard!  I love the fact that this video is very challenging.  The great thing is that I've done it  for years now and I can add reps when I'm in the mood while she is explaining the next move.  Every time I do this video (I only do it once maybe twice a week when I don't feel like going to the gym and sometimes I don't do it for a few months) I am sore the next day.  3) You can tailor this video to fit your needs.  Don't like high impact?  March instead.  Don't want to do a full sit-up? Do crunches.  Worried about knee strain on the lunges? Hold onto a chair and just do squats.  Or, add a few more reps.  I don't find that it's too fast at all.  There is also a glossary at the end of the tape that shows proper form. I will say that I don't ever do the Trunk Circles because all they do is make me dizzy and there doesn't seem to be any benefit by doing them.  I fast forward through this one.  3) It's got great music.  Subtle, not overpowering and not that annoying dance music with the same beat over and over and over...  This video definitely keeps my interest and I recommend it to anyone who brings up workout videos.  I have also tried Cindy's first video and found it to be quite laughable and although it had good intentions, it falls short on the workout part.  Who works out in thier bathing suit anyway???  In short, this is a great video for someone who wants a challenging workout but doesn't want to be bombarded by annoying music and overly happy \\"feel-the-burn\\" aerobics instructor type people.
B000002IKR|5.0|Wow. That's the word that just about sums up this album. This CD is absolutely excellent, and is one of the finest CD's in the thrash genre. I also see this album as one of the best debut albums ever. Alex rips through ever song with incredible arpeggios and searing solos, while Eric keeps up the pace with his intellegent rhythms. Rhythm section leaders Greg and Louie tear it up as well (BTW, no offense to Lars or anything, but Louie blows him away). Not to mention the haunting vocals of mister Billy himself.<BR>The Band:<BR>   Chuck, vocals- YES!!! One of thrashes finest vocalists does probably the best he's ever done on this album. Chuck was definately one of the reasons I was drawn to Testament. Check out his pipes on stuff like 'First Strike is Deadly' or 'Over The Wall.' And it's really cool to see that Chuck was usin' his deep voice even back then ('C.O.T.L.O.D.'), way before death metal even began!<BR>   Louie, drums- Probably was the best drummer in the thrash genre (That doesn't include Dave Lombardo, Igor Cavalera or Paul Bostaph, because I consider them to be death-thrash musicians). I mean, you can't deny his greatness on tracks such as 'C.O.T.L.O.D.', 'First..', or 'The Haunting.' This guy's style is a like something you've never with a mix of Ulrich and Lombardo. It's pretty sad that Clement never got back together with T after the 'The Ritual', and he will truly be missed. <BR>   Alex, lead & rhythm guitars- At first listen, I didn't really like Alex's style. The arpeggios he pulled every few seconds didn't impress me, and in some areas, began to annoy me. But, now I've become somewhat of a more intellegent guitar player, and now I see that Skolnick was in a world of his own. Man, no one has ever played like this guy has. No one has been able to pull of those super fast scales with such melody and perfection. Alex's timing and excution is another aspect of his beauty. It's sad to see him go, but I was happily shocked to see that he's worked on the new'First Strike Still Deadly' album. (Nothing new, but great to hear him again.)<BR>   Eric, lead & rhythm guitar-Ah, yes, Peterson, one of metal's finest rhythm guitarists. While his stuff on hear might not sound very incredible (but still great, mind you), Eric's work on new Testament and Dragonlord stuff shows that this man surpasses almost every rhythm guitarist, even Jon Schaffer of Iced Earth. Plus, Eric writes most of my favorite T song of all time, the horribly underrated (not to mention unused in their live set) 'C.O.T.L.O.D.' <BR>   Greg, bass- This guy's bass rattles and hums all throughout 'The Legacy.' Greg's supreme talent isn't excuted here I believe (To see Greg's best, listen to the Oriental-titled instrumental on 'Low'), but he sure as heck should impress you. It's too bad this album was badly produced, but amazingly you can still hear Greg's booms.<BR>   <BR>This is an excellent start for anyone who is looking for some hardcore THRASH! It's sad that not many people ever heard of this band. This is the best choice for thrash if you're lookin' for something new and are bored (well, I can't believe you can bored of these guys) with the same thrash like Metallica and Anthrax.
B000068QY7|3.0|Keep in mind, Oasis fans don't come any bigger than me, That said, I will break the newbie down as well as I can in this early stage.  After it was all said and done, Standing on the Shoulder of Giants was good but not great. It lacked the gel of a great band. The gel that comes when a great band is making powerful and meaningful rock. \\"Chemistry\\" fails at this as well, but it succeeds on other levels too. First off, Liam's songs are much better than his Little James effort. The only thing is that he should give John Lennon his late 70's material back after he's done with it. (but then again, who ever accused Oasis of originality) \\"Born On A Different Cloud\\" has a unfamilar spookiness to it that should have closed the LP out. \\"Better Man\\" is pretty rockin', but take it from me, is much better live. Next is Gem's gem, \\"Hung In A Bad Place\\". I love this one! It's very Some Might Say meets Morning Glory, a real stormer and one of the highlights live. The 2 singles are just that, both do their job and get the melody across with a little distortion and a lot of swagger. The rest of the record is very good except for the strained All In My Mind and forgettable instrumental called A Quick Peep.  So all in all, a fine return to form, if even it's 80% cooked. Definitley the 3rd best in my opinion  Cary's Oasis LP breakdown (in order of release)  Definitely Maybe  -  10.0  Morning Glory  -  9.0  Be Here Now  -  6.2  Masterplan  -  7.7  Standing On the Shoulder of Giants  -  6.7  Heathen Chemistry  - 7.1
B000002IMG|5.0|This album is defineately one of T's finest. While probably not as catchy or as fun as 'The Legacy', you can't deny that the guitar and bass work on this album are EXCELLENT. This album probably will not impress you on first listen, but, geez, does it grow on you.It's always refreshing to pop in this old beaut and bang yer head to some good ol' fashioned TTHHRRAASSHH!!!<BR>The Band:<BR> Chuck, vocals- THE PREACHEEERRR!!! Yes, Chuck delivers with just as much, if not more, of a punch than on 'The Legacy.' It's sad that Chuck didn't demonstrate his high vocals on 'First Strike Still Deadly', but oh well. We have the oldies to listen to!<BR> Eric, lead & rhythm guitars- Heavy, heavy, heavy, and I don't even think Eric's detuned that much! It's so cool to see that, yes, you can be as heavy as ever without detuning to that Korn-ish level. Eric shreds with even more intensity than he did on 'The Legacy.' Just listen to the title track and 'The Preacher.'<BR> Alex, lead & rhythm guitars- Whoooooaaaaa! Skolnick really outdoes himself with this one, and does the best on this album that he's ever done. He just about surpasses the King & Hanneman duo, and even almost surpasses Hammet. Just listen to the first minute of 'Hypnosis', or the lead and intro of the title track, or four minutes and five seconds of blessings dubbed 'Musical Death' (A Dirge). There's just too many demonstrations of how good Skolnick is. Why, oh why, was this band wasn't better known.<BR> Greg, bass- Greg cranks them bass lines out yet again. Hot d@mn, is this dude awesome! I really hope that he gets back together with T again, though DiGiorgio is a fine replacement. Why not have two bassists?!<BR> Louie, drums- Too bad that Louie didn't get a chance to show us his double-bassing skills on 'The New Order', but he still keeps his status as greatest thrash drummer (not 'death-thrash' drummer, such as Sepultura, Death, Slayer, etc.). <br />This album is pure sweetness all the way, but is probably not a good start for new and aspiring T fans. Start with more accesible records such as 'The Legacy', 'The Ritual', or 'Practice What You Preach.' Keep the irons up, Testament!
0440224764|5.0|Thrilling! Edge of my seat, couldn't wait to see how Patrick had tricked them all.  I was so disappointed that it ended. John Grisham definately needs to write a part II. The only other book I have read so quickly was the Firm.
0380820846|5.0|Like everyone else, I have been waiting for Romancing Mr Bridgerton to come out and it definitely was worth the wait. <br />Penelope Featherington has been in love with her best friend's brother for years, but Colin has always regarded Penelope with a mixture of affection and pity. Penelope is kind of plain and awkward, and she has largely been either ignored or made fun of at balls. But underneath the shyness, Penelope is intelligent, funny and kind and Colin begins to see these traits years later when he returns from his travels. Slowly he feels more and more drawn to her and Quinn does a great job of developing this change. <br />I really liked Penelope's character. She is not this perfect heroine that many authors try to create. She is passable attractive at best and shy. Only people she knows well know the real Penelope who has a sharp wit and good sense of humor. I also liked Colin. He is a genuinely good person, and when he realizes how he feels about Penelope, he becomes her biggest champion. He is protective, possessive and loving. <br />I would recommend this story to anyone, but I would also suggest reading the first three stories of the Bridgerton series to get more background information.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I've seen all the video-game based movies that came out from \\"Mortal Kombat\\" to \\"Resident Evil\\", since they're both directed by Paul Anderson.  When I seen this movie in theaters, I really liked it alot, because I seen a few zombie flicks on TV.  The special effects were awesome, making the blood look too realistic.  I'm also looking forward to the sequel, if they ever make one.
B000067CPX|5.0|What a great new album from the Peppers!!  I picked up the new CD early this morning, with much anticipation considering their great work on their last effort &quot;Californication&quot; and the new single &quot;By The Way&quot;.  I have been listening all day long.  There are no bad songs on the disc, just all great tunes with thumping bass lines and the funk we associate with the Chili Peppers.  Long time fans of the Chili Peppers will enjoy this album and so will new fans of the band.  This album has it all and for all tastes.  If you want a great music CD, with originality and musicianship, go pick this up today and you won't be disappointed.  In fact, you'll be thrilled with the purchase.
B00006690G|5.0|I am not saying I agree with his accessive cursing, but this CD is awesome. Without me is a catchy track with a good beat. Sing for the Moment isn't really like Eminem's other tracks but it's good. Business is also another good track, with a catchy chorus. But my all time favorite song on the album is Hailie's Song, which is basically about his daughter. Very sweet song. I don't really like the skits, it's waste of space. The other songs on this track is good. If you can take the lyrics go ahead and by this, it's worth the $ !!
B00001NFCY|2.0|I first got into Creed when they first Realeased My own Prison and like everyone else I thought they were great.  I liked the album but the more I listened to it, the more I didn't like it!<br />I then got their second album and again I was blown away by them and thought they were great......and then the same thing happend.  Don't get me wrong, it IS a good album and it sounds good but it just seems to have something missing.  The lyrics go from bad to worse, which for me, brings the whole album down.  Scott Stapp is a good frontman and has a good, if unremarkable voice but as a lyricist I find him very poor. All the songs all seem like overwrought ballads or rock songs and seem to go on far longer than they should and it seemed vastly overproduced. <br />If you like Creed or are a fan of the first album then go ahead and buy this one, you'll probably love it.  If not, don't.  It just doesn't seem worth it.
B00005N83M|4.0|This CD is pretty good compared to J.Lo's earlier CD's. There is only one problem...Many tracks sound almost the same. My favorite song on the track is probably &quot;Play&quot; or &quot;I'm Gonna Be Alright&quot;...some other songs I enjoyed on the track were &quot;Ain't it Funny&quot; &quot;I'm Real Remix&quot; &quot;Love dont cost a thing&quot; and &quot;That's not me&quot;...the other songs are pretty good too. If you enjoy J.Lo then this would be a great CD for you.
B00004TRD8|5.0|I think T2 is a great movie.I think for that year the special effects are so cool.I love movies,I've practacly seen every movie since 1995 and this is one of my favorite.I never get tired of watching this movie.I also think the best special effects in that movie was the liqued steel guy.if you have a choice I would tell you to buy this movie.
0790731002|2.0|Seriousely, who else could take an excellent cast, huge budget, and a decent script and make a movie that stinks like a pot of week old refried beans? No one else, but Joel Shumacher. WHY DID HE HAVE TO PUT NIPPLES ON THE BATSUIT?! As for Val Kilmer, in my opinion he is THE DEFINATIVE BATMAN. I don't care what other people might say about Micheal Keaton, Val Kilmer IS BATMAN. It's a shame that he the movie is such a bomb. He didn't make it into Batman and Robin, because he constantly protested Shumacher's questionable directing choices. When you watch Batman and Robin, wich was even more of a bomb, you can't help but wonder why they didn't just let Val Kilmer direct and get rid of that cancerouse Joel Shumacher. Whatever coolness this movie has, it was against Shumacher's will, and was put in because of Val Kilmer's demand. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to save this movie from Shumacher's trechery. As for the villains, I still don't see why they had to start pairing up the villains. Two Face and Riddler? What the heck! Oh well. Tommy Lee Jones plays a decent Two Face, however his character is completely off, for wuch the script is likely to blame. Jim Carey plays the Riddler, and got the character more or less accurate. As for Chris O'Donnel, he plays Robin, and fits into the role quite well. However, the good cast choices cannot make up for that walking-cinema-tragety known as Joel Shumacher. I bought this movie simply because I like Val Kilmer's batman. The rest of this movie however is THE PITTS.
B00003CXPJ|2.0|Not the best comedy of our time .I think Zoolander is a very stupid movie.The only reason I think it is a little funnyis because it is so stupid it is funny.It is very porley made and it just isn't the type of comedy I would acually like.If your in the mood for a comedy don't see this one.
0553260111|4.0|Okay, I admit it, I saw the movie, then decided to read the book. I am a big fan of anything involving spies, yet had not read anything by Robert Ludlam until two weeks ago.<br />First off, the movie and the book part ways in the scene when Bourne is pulled out of the Mediterranean. From that point on, the main character's motivation is the same, the past history seems the same, but the two stories are completely different. I loved the movie, I thought it was great, and hope they can make a franchise out of it. I am not sure how well it will work, given that a big draw is the man trying to figure out who he is.<br />The book is very good. The story is clever, the characters are very well developed. It is a page turner, which means you might be going to sleep late if you start reading it.<br />I finished the book last night, and will probably pick up the next one on the way home from work today.

0679720200|5.0|The Stranger is a haunting, challenging masterpiece of literature.  While it is fiction, it actually manages to express the complex concepts and themes of existential philosophy better than the movement's most noted philosophical writings and almost as well as Dostoyevsky's Notes From the Underground.  This is a new kind of literature.  The story in and of itself is rather simple, but the glimpses into the intellect and feelings of the protagonist are the sources of the magic of this novel.  M.Meursault is a normal man in Algiers, France.  When we meet him, he is on the way to his mother's funeral, where he says very little, expresses no remorse over her death, and immediately returns home.  The next day, he goes swimming, meets Marie, takes her to see a comedy that night, and spends the next few weeks living his normal life and occassionally seeing Marie.  He ends up getting indirectly involved in a dispute between his neighbor Raymond and a girl who did him wrong, and the conflict culminates in an encounter on the beach between Raymond, Meursault, and the girl's Arab brother and friend.  Raymond is cut with a knife, but the whole episode seems to be resolved.  Meursault, though, decides later to take another walk on the beach because he is too worn out to go inside and rejoin his friends, and somewhat inexplicably he ends up killing one of the Arabs.  The second half of the novel examines Meursault's thoughts in relation to his trial and sentence; interestingly, he is prosecuted as much if not more for his moral character than for the crime of murder itself.<br />Basically, Meursault does not care about anything, does not feel anything for anyone (including himself, for the most part).  He looks at life objectively and determines that it really doesn't matter whether he does something or not in the overall scheme of things.  When Marie expresses her love for him, he tells her he will marry her if it will make her happy but that he cannot say he really loves her.  He expresses no remorse for killing the Arab because it just happened; he had no intention of doing it, but the fact is that he did, so there's little point in dwelling on it.  He cares about the present and, to a lesser degree, the future, but the past is meaningless for the very reason that it is the past.  Meursault sees things as they are; rather than rely on flights of fantasy and imagination (the typical tools of the Romanticists), he deals with facts in the here and now rather than run from them and has no problem admitting the seemingly obvious fact that man is a creature of utter depravity.  He rejects religion; since each man must eventually die, what does it matter what he does while on earth.  It is a man's hopes and dreams that weigh down his very existence; Marsault can only find happiness by cleansing himself of all such illusory notions.<br />Needless to say, this is not an uplifting book, but it is an engaging, thought-provoking one.  While Camus cannot be called a true existentialist in his own philosophical outlook, his fiction does epitomize many existentialist ideas.  Marsault is a protagonist like no other in literature--you cannot like him, he is obviously guilty of killing a man in cold blood, and he is of a cold-hearted nature, yet you do understand some of his thinking, find yourself more and more interested in his dark outlook on life, and have to admit that much of what he believes makes sense.He expresses no remorse for killing the Arab because it just happened; he had no intention of doing it, but the fact is that he did, so there's little point in dwelling on it.

B000067CPX|4.0|By The Way is an excellent album, but not as good as Blood Sugar Sex Magic or Californication.  But Still a great album, this time the around the style is more like Californication but more passive, you do not hear or feel the same type of rush you did with Blood Sugar Sex Magic, it's a different type of album.  Buy this album and see for yourself, I have all the Chili Pepper albums and have been a huge fan for a long time and this album is one of the better rock albums you will here this year, you will not regret the purchase.
B000063K5W|5.0|I'll keep it short and simple and to-the-point.  This is my favorite movie ever.  What a film!  The music rocks (after seeing it in the cinema, I immediately found the soundtrack).  The acting is wonderful.  The story is both touching and hilarious.  I love everything about this movie, and when it was over, I was hoping it would never end.  BRAVO!  I would recommend it to anyone.
B000002AVF|1.0|This CD is a total waste of money, I bought it only because of the song \\"One Sweet Day\\" With Boyz II Men. And the other songs, are so dull. I actually gave this DayDream Mariah CD away, to one of my best friends at school... Celine Dion can do much better, than this. Anyhow, I'd suggest do NOT buy this CD, and don't waste your money on it... If you want to get a good CD go out and buy Celine Dion's A New Day Has Come CD or Falling Into You CD, now Celine's albums are much better, than Mariah Carey's...
B000063K5W|5.0|This is my favorite film ever.  The music rocks--I went out and bought the soundtrack immediately after seeing it in the cinema.  The acting is fabulous.  The story is both hilarious and touching.  Can't be beat!  Would recommend it to anyone!  BRAVO!

6305909326|4.0|This is indeed a very intriguing piece of a bigger intriguing puzzle. Just like the movie, where three copies of one book must be found for the message of the books to make any sense, one must know the story of Polanski and his dance with the devil for this movie to make the mind boggling amount of sense it ultimately does make.<br />I loved the romance with books that the character of Johnny Depp has, being one who tracks down valuable editions and traveling in the circles of readers who value such things. The scenes of wall to wall rare books made my heart race the way some people are excited by football, or pornography, or chocolate. For me, it's books.<br />Depp must track down three copies of one volume to determine their authenticity, for each one is a little different -- only to discover, with his brilliant mind, that all three books work together to manifest the message of the books: the ability to conjure up the devil!<br />You can imagine the imagery that can be lent to such a thesis, and it exists as only Polanski can do it -- Polanski, of course, being the producer of Rosemary's baby and the former husband of the former actress Sharon Tate, and everything that goes along with that. Polanski is not naive when it comes to the oddities of Lucifer, of that I am quite sure. What his relationship is, exactly, is not for me to discern. I will say, though, that there were parts of this movie that reminded me, with discomfort, of Eyes Wide Shut.<br />This movie is not for everyone. It is definitely not for children. But it is worth taking a scholarly look at what is currently expressing our American culture.<br />It's kind of creepy...
B000067CPX|5.0|While Blood Sugar Sex Magik is arguably one of the best rock albums of all time, I've always felt more comfortable with the toned down styling of 1999's Californication. Singing along with 'Otherside' and 'Scar Tissue' while driving or in the shower these past years have left me begging for more rhcp every day. My prayers have been answered, and more, with this absolutely fantastic album.<BR>The title track is an instant classic; even countless playings on the radio can't get me bored of it. Most of the songs are standard Californication fare, and that's not a bad thing. The uninitiated may find the soft tones of Kiedis' voice a bit repetitive, but it's all enjoyable. <BR>'Tear' is undoubtedly my favorite track (12); the part where it goes \\"devil may cry, devil may care\\" hits a chord with me every time. Singing along has never been this much fun. RHCP get's it done again; I wholeheartedly recommend this CD.<br />(the lyrics for all the songs are included, in case you're wondering)
B00000J2L8|5.0|DR. STRANGELOVE is many things to many people.  It is one of the most brilliant dark comedies every made.  It is one of the most powerful protests against military insanity ever created.  It is Peter Sellers greatest film, and Stanley Kubrick's greatest film.  And, to one disgruntled soul who left the theater screaming in disgust at how \\"it makes a mockery of our country's military!\\" it is a denunciation of the American \\"strength through power\\" mindset.  It is also the most deadpan film ever made.<br />I know of few films that contain so many utterly perfect moments as this one.  Kubrick's brilliance is the way he takes these potentially disparate moments and blends them into a magnificent, coherent whole.  Anyone who has seen STRANGELOVE will have his or her own set of best moments.  Mine includes:  George C. Scott's obsessive gum chewing; Peter Sellers as the president shouting, \\"You can't fight in here, this is the War Room!\\"; General Jack Ripper's disquisition on bodily fluids; Kennan Wynn's Col. \\"Bat\\" Guano warning Capt. Mandrake that he will have to answer to the Coca Cola company; everything that Slim Pickens says throughout the film; \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\"; President Muffley's long phone conversation with Dmitri, the Soviet premier; and, last, but not least, Dr. Strangelove himself (who resembles nothing so much as FDR if he had been an insane ex-Nazi).<br />In 1964, when this film was made, the idea of nuclear war was horrific to everyone.  Bomb shelters were being sold everywhere, and one of the hot exhibitions at any State Fair would be the one displaying the shelter models out that year.  Numerous movies were made trying to drive home the seriousness of the threat.  But Kubrick, instead, made a comedy about it, partly, unquestionably, to point up the absurdity of the entire situation.  But perhaps also to give us some perspectives on ourselves, on our tendency to demonize \\"the other,\\" on our silly assumptions, and perhaps as a way of deflating some of the tension of the situation by helping us all to laugh at ourselves.  There have been many \\"topical\\" films made over the decades, but perhaps none has managed to so completely transcend its particular period of time as to become a masterpiece for any and all times.ting some of the tension of the situation by helping us all to laugh at ourselves.

B000051Y0G|5.0|This was one of my first albums when I was 8 years old and I instantly became a fan.  Now at the ripe age of mid twenties  I still listen to her.  And with a remasted cd including 3 live songs that propel her voice.  Well this a a win win situation.
B00005Q66T|1.0|Unlike The Immaculate Collection, there are no new hits to make this collection memorable. If you are a hard core Madonna fan you'll have already owned every song on this collection, most of them tried and true hits with the bizarre ommision of her remake of American Pie. If you do not own many Madonna cd's or are just getting into her then this is definately for you but for the major fans it'll just be buying a collection of songs you already own.
B000063V8R|4.0|Star Trek: The Next Generation moved from puberty into growing adolescence in Year Three with the maturing of the prime characters, the change in uniforms and the standardization of much of the ship's functions and sounds -- without denegrating the story lines in any way. So much was gained and, no matter who or what the cause, episodes such as &quot;Yesterday's Enterprise&quot; and &quot;The Offspring&quot; proved the growth that Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner brought to their characters, which continues through Year Six. Well worth the purchase price!
B00000634J|5.0|The man was an icon, a prophet, a leader, a talent beyond words. This is truly a collection of his best work and a thrill to have around. It will remind you of the passages we've been through, and the focus we need to keep in these trying times.<br />I bought this CD in particular to have a copy of &quot;Working Class Hero.&quot; John Lennon knew what the system was doing to us while we were still jumping through hoops for the brass ring. He knew it, and he said it, speaking Truth to Power ... and he paid the price.<br />Still, his words ring true, and are more powerful than ever. Make friends with John Lennon.

B00000JCB2|5.0|... This CD is everything CSatHDFW is not, and that is great! Great guitar/bass/drum with just right lyrical rappings.<br />Break Stuff, while violent in nature, is my favorite song on here.<br />Great to listen to after a long day at work/school.<br />Definitely a CD worth listening to all the way through! I highly recommend if you like rap-rock.<br />If you don't, well I can't help you.
B000002MFN|5.0|This album in a lost gem unfortunately it's popularity was shadowed by it's back to back release with the awful Sex debacle. Because it was released during Madonna's angry sex period it is often panned without the so-called critics even bothering to give it a chance. It runs the gaunlet of emotions there's the sexy side, the Sultry Erotica, and the kinky where life  begins. There are dancing hits to get your inner moppet dancing (Deeper and Deeper, and a hot remake of Peggy Lee's Fever) and some amazingly personal ballads (In THis Life and Bad Girl)<BR>You must ignore the bad publicity that surrounded Erotica and give this album a shot
B000067CPX|4.0|Not liking the title track i was a bit dubious about the album and prepared myself for a disappiontment - but didn't get one. The opening (and title) track, By The Way, shouldn't be made the basis of judgement on this album, even if you like it. The good thing about this album is every song is individual, a quality not found very often within many albums. <BR>  This album, even more so than on Californication, is a John Frusciante masterpiece. The guitar intros on each track are amazing. By The Way is a mixture of everything Chili Peppers over the past 10 or so years, its well worth investing in!
B000006YMN|5.0|Alone at THE TOP!  She is the BEST!<br />Today's so called Divas have a lot they could learn from her.  I've always admired her ability to make every word come across so clearly.  From what I've read, she doesn't speak English particularly well - but I'll tell you, she can sing it superbly!  Her voice is so beautiful, and I thought it had been lost to us after ABBA.<br />I learned about this album by pure luck.  I had burned some CDs of my favorite ABBA songs for use when I'm out camping (I never take my originals), and I was looking to see if I could find any ABBA photos on the Internet to use for my CD label artwork.  What I found amazed me!

Three of her after- ABBA albums were released with English language versions (and one Greatest Hits album also).  I immediately set about getting them for my collection, and I now own all of them.  But this one is special.  To me, this one is flawless.  Every song is beautifully done.  Please understand - there are songs on her other albums that I would rate above some of the songs on this album - but I think this is the most completely likeable album.  I've read someplace that she considers &quot;Wrap Your Arms Around Me&quot; to be her favorite.  But, I like every single track on this album - and there are very few albums by any artist that I've ever said that about.  There are fast songs, slow songs, happy songs and sad songs.  Every song is a gem.  Of course I do have favorites -  &quot;Maybe It Was Magic&quot; and &quot;Little White Secrets&quot;.  These two by themselves would have been worth the cost of the album.<br />Don't expect the sound of ABBA - it isn't here, but what is here is pure Agnetha, and it's wonderful.  If you liked herwith ABBA, I think you will be very happy to have this CD included in your collection.  I rate this album as a MUST HAVE.  By the way, I rate her other albums the same way - but each one of them has  one track that I don't like.<br />I've heard that she is working on a new album - if that's true, rest assured I'll have it also!
0316666343|5.0|I thought Sebold's story was fantastic.  First of all, the narration is ambitious (as told from heaven!); and secondly, she makes sure that despite this \\"fantastical\\" point-of-view, the story never comes off as sappy, or banal.  It's just a very good, intimate, uplifting story of a girl who views the lives of the survivors of her death from up above.  Very creative.<br />My one criticism is about the events towards the end involving her \\"first love\\" --I just thought that that was a bit unrealistic, but it was still sweet nonetheless.<br />I highly recommend this book because it's so different, fresh, and again, brilliant!  I assure you, you'd like it!

But I have to say it, I was pretty bored, even though I tried and tried to like it.  <BR>It's not the standard I've come to expect from Quinn.  The plot was lame.  I mean it all centered on revealing Lady W, and let's face it, I figured that one out in The Viscount Who Loved Me.  Apart from that not much else happened in the book.  Colin and Penelope as a couple left me cold and all I could think was, I wonder if Eloise's book will be better.<BR>Also where was the humour?!?!?  Yes I know a book doesn't have to be funny to be good.  I love Lisa Kleypas and she's pretty humourless, but i didn't even laugh once throughout the book which added to my feeling of dissatisfaction.  <BR>Maybe if it had been part of another series, but the style seemed such a departure from the preceding novels that i have to ask myself why.
B000065V1V|4.0|Bowie's returned with a greatest hits album, sort of. By that meaning you'll hear elements in all these songs that you think you've heard in other Bowie songs. &quot;Gemini Spacecraft&quot; could come from Black Tie / White Noise or Glass Spider from his late 80's electropop days. The raucous &quot;Cactus&quot; could be sung by Ziggy Stardust, the spohisticated &quot;Slow Burn&quot; from the Thin White Duke. They're all here. But the album really kicks in with songs that show him at his best when least lyrically complicated. &quot;Everyone Says Hi&quot; is an easily understood upbeat ballad (and probably his most radio friendly single in years) about a loved one leaving home, and &quot;Better Future&quot; speaks for what we all expect in this day of instant gratification and can rarely have in reality. Bowie's an artist who paints in broad strokes like a Van Gogh. A few times just missing the mark, but in this age of pre-packaged rock, this album's a gem.
B000067CPX|4.0|John Frusciante's album-to-album development is now quite clear.  He pushes the band toward their best effort yet.  This is the first Chili Pepper record without any weak tracks.  The band's improved use of harmony both in the vocals and with the guitar opens up some exciting new avenues for them.  Beach Boys funk?  Whatever, it works for them.

0783226063|1.0|Each time I try to watch this movie (and I have never been able to make it all the way through, despite my enjoyment of the book), I am simply stunned at how many talented and seemingly well-cast actors are utterly wasted in this bloated, boring, ineptly written and directed pseudo-epic. I recently tried, one more time, to get through enough of it to at least savor Juergen Prochnow as Duke Leto (whose scenes should have been greatly enhanced), but was too repulsed by the scenes surrounding his to stick it out. Why is it that so much of modern science fiction allots so much screen time playing up the gross and repulsive, and so little to the beautiful and wonderful? (\\"Contact\\" being the rare exception.) I'm not talking about some bland, sanitized vision of other worlds, but how many people really enjoy long close-ups of pustules? Apparently the filmmakers, and the people who love this movie. And even if the film weren't so repulsive, it is just plain boring.... Long, awkward scenes of exposition, horrible art, voice-overs and a general inability to construct a coherent cinematic narrative.... (Every filmmaker should be forced to study at the feet of Peter Jackson and his team to learn that complex book-to-cinema CAN be done brilliantly!) For an ambitious movie, I think \\"Dune\\" is the worst I have ever seen - proving that even a dream cast cannot overcome a disastrous script, direction and editing.

B000065U1N|3.0|As much as I wanted to like this movie, I have to admit that it really isn't entirely successful.  I understand why Scott wanted to make the film, given that the book is powerful and influential.  But Speilberg's work in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; has raised the bar in war films so high that I think it is difficult to make a film that compares favorably.  If this had been made several years ago, it would have made a much greater impression, especially when compared to &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; or &quot;The Deer Hunter,&quot; which seem dated in retrospect.  I wish this had been a great film, because it is about the men who are out there _right now_ fighting Al Qaeda, but it is not a great film or even a particularly engaging one.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I saw this movie twice in theaters. I would have seen it again if it weren't for my wife. I'm not a big RE fan. I am a zombie movie fan. I was very happy to see one for our generation. Game fans should realize that games rarely transfer well to movie.  It's like reading a book right before seeing the movie. The movie is neveras good as the book...or that is how we see it. I really love the movie. I do hope there is an unrated version. maybe get a little more action.
B000006YMN|5.0|Alone at THE TOP! She is the BEST!<br />Today's so called Divas have a lot they could learn from her. I've always admired her ability to make every word come across so clearly. From what I've read, she doesn't speak English particularly well - but I'll tell you, she can sing it superbly! Her voice is so beautiful, and I thought it had been lost to us after ABBA.<br />I learned about this album by pure luck. I had burned some CDs of my favorite ABBA songs for use when I'm out camping (I never take my originals), and I was looking to see if I could find any ABBA photos on the Internet to use for my CD label artwork. What I found amazed me! There are many sites dedicated to ABBA (20 years after they last performed together), and they are very informative about the group and its individual members.<br />It was there that I found out Agnetha had a very successful solo career after ABBA - but mostly in Europe. Three of her after ABBA albums were released with English language versions (and one Greatest Hits album also). I immediately set about getting them for my collection, and I now own all of them. But this one is special. To me, this one is flawless. Every song is beautifully done. I like every single track on this album - and there are very few albums by any artist that I've ever said that about. There are fast songs, slow songs, happy songs and sad songs. Every song is a gem. Of course I do have favorites - \\"Maybe It Was Magic\\" and \\"Little White Secrets\\". These two by themselves would have been worth the cost of the album.<br />Don't expect the sound of ABBA - it isn't here, but what is here is pure Agnetha, and it's wonderful. If you liked her with ABBA, I think you'll be very happy to have this CD included in your collection. I rate this album as a MUST HAVE. By the way, I rate her other albums the same way - but each one of the others has at least one track that I don't like.<br />I've heard that she is working on a new album - if that's true, rest assured I'll have it also!
B000067CPX|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers release yet another awesome album. I enjoyed every track, and the more I listened to them, the more I loved them. It's inevitable that my favorite song on this excellent album, &quot;Can't Stop,&quot; will top the charts in a few weeks. Other well done and addictive tracks are &quot;Universally Speaking&quot; and &quot;Venice Queen.&quot; If you like RHCP, pick this one up now. Believe me, this one will stay in your CD player for a long time to come.

0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold has done a masterful job of telling an unusual story, narrated by a 14 year old murder victim from her heaven. She and the author showed that even in the worst of circumstances, there can be light and hope. Every word in this book is polished and perfect, and every character is fully developed. As a reader, these are things that I really appreciate.<br />Each character in this book deals differently with Susie's murder and each one's pain is different. Susie tells her story in a matter-of-fact voice as she watches each person handle his or her grief in their own way and in their own time, sometimes unraveling in the process. She comes to believe that if she watches hard enough, she might be able to change the lives of her loved ones. Her voice is full of such inner peacefulness that you know she has risen above her horrible death and the loss of her innocence. Her descriptions of \\"my heaven\\" are wonderful and her term \\"the Inbetween\\" makes one pause to think......<br />Is death really the end of life, or is there more? Sebold gives her readers a lot of food for thought concerning this question. Personally, I find that it is comforting to think that my deceased loved ones are *out there* watching what is now going on. I am not a religious or spiritual person, so this is difficult for me to imagine, but this book certainly made me wonder.

B000002KBA|5.0|Purple was the best Heavy metal band around in 1970. They had the musicians in heavy rock. The Who were simple and tried to just be the loudest. Zeppelin was good but not as skilled. Steppenwolf was heavy but too political. Sabbath was heavy but sludgy sounding. The Doors were acid drenched. Purple was the best cleancut pound for pound metal band around in 1970. This album was heavy,fast,loud, and it moved away from the prog style.<BR>Gillian was awesome. They had their own style. Bands like Savoy Brown were doing heavy boogie rock. Zeppelin was heavy blues. Sabbath was gloomy slushy &quot;stoner&quot; rock. ELP and Yes were doing prog metal. This album was just plain metal. The band was tight sounding and the recording was superb. I wish I could give this 10 stars!
B00005QDW1|2.0|I have always been a No Doubt fan, ever since Tragic Kingdom, their first big success. Return of saturn was a powerfull follow-up record, and my personnal favorite. However No Doubts' latest Rock Steady is a huge dissappointment to me!!! What happened to the skaw-grunge-great rock sound known to the bands earlier success??? That was the No Doubt that I loved, and will always love! To me this record is a true sell-out!!! It sounds like all the other hip-hoppy-poppy junk out there! with songs like \\"hella good\\" and \\"making out\\" and not to mention \\"hey baby\\" give me a break! I only hope the real No Doubt comes back soon, I really liked them!!! Oh, if you like No Doubt, do not buy this record! The 2 stars in my review stand for \\"COME BACK\\"!!!
0684857820|4.0|This memoir of the author's horrible rape and beating while she was a college student, written many years later, is a moving account of a terrible part of her life. Her courage and persistence in seeking justice for herself was admirable because one can only imagine how difficult this was for her. She never gave up during her long journey from fear to hope.<br />Sebold spared no details in this honest portrayal, but she never resorted to whining  about it or self-pity. I admire her greatly for this attitude...she is a braver woman that I could ever be. She pushed on, basically alone, showing her inner strength as she battled her demons and the inability of her friends to deal with her rape. I thought that her passage through the legal system was especially well told and revealing.<br />I thought the part entitled \\"Aftermath\\" was a bit out of place --it was just sort of tacked on and I really did not need to read about the author's drug use and sex life after college. I would have liked to read about how she dealt with the aftermath of the rape as it affected her relationships with men, her parents, her friends, and her career decisions.

6300267881|4.0|When the film THE EXORCIST was released in 1973, the huge sales of the Peter William Blatty novel guaranteed an equally smashing film success.  The movie did not disappoint. It was full of scenes that were shocking and more than a little disgusting.  After all, who could forget Regan with her projectile vomiting? Yet, the movie contained more than just a parade of chilling scenes.  If that is all it had been, then it would have been just another reasonably successful horror film. What set it apart from its predecessors was the melding of the abomination of demonic possession with the idea that a young innocent girl was to be the receptacle of that possession. In previous horror films in which one was possessed, usually by some extra-terrestrial creature, the object of the possession was the Handsome Young Scientist who dared to ask forbidden questions about the nature of non-human life.  In THE EXORCIST, not only was a twelve-year old girl chosen as the receptacle but the method used to choose her was a random one.  It is almost as if director William Friedkin pandered to the deeply entrenched fear of all parents that their prepubescent daughter was subject to random rape by some evil, skulking demon lurking in the shadows.<BR>As soon as the demon Pazuzu is uncovered in Iraq, the scene shifts to Washington DC, where right away the appearance on screen of Regan (Linda Blair) foreshadows her inevitable violation.  Further complicating this queasy mixture of rape and demonology is the further subtext of seduction by degree.  Regan is possessed, but the nasty scenes that stick out tend to be the ones that occur later in the movie.  Friedkin wisely allows the possession to encroach on Regan by degree.  First, the odd rat noises in the attic.  Then Regan urinating at a party given by her mother.  Then Regan being examined by doctors in such an invasive way that their tests for an organic cause seem hardly less horrible than what Pazuzu had been doing. At each step along the way, the image of Regan as the sweet virgin degenerates until the monstrous climax when she uses a crucifix to do on a literal level what Pazuzu had been doing on a supernatural one.  Following this scene, the movie develops into a race between the twin exorcists, played superbly by Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow, and Pazuzu as to who will gain final possession of Regan's body and soul.  The feelings of disgust and horror that surely were part of Friedkin's intent to inflict on the audience may have had more to do with the revulsion going on in their own heads at the sight of their daughter surrugate on screen than with the more dramatic image of pea soup flying toward the startled face of Father Karras.
B000068QY7|2.0|Nothing new here, folks.   I think this is step backwards for Oasis.  I was wishing Oasis would reinvent itself with this new album.  Well, it hasnt happened.   This album has 11 songs that arent bad (with the exception of Force of Nature which is ghastly) but never really give the bliss and sheer musical power of  songs like Some Might Say Dont Go Away, Live Forever or Go Let it Out.  Moreover the ballads here are light miles behind anything remotely similar, or as good as Dont Look Back in Anger or Champagne Supernova.   <br />Here are some observations on a few tracks:<BR>Forces of Nature:  <BR>theres no excuse for rehashing and recycling old tunes to put on a new album.  Force of Nature was an old b-side and sounds like one.  The song is really bad, and the lyrics atrocious taking all my stash, taking all my cash Noels voice sounds really hollow here for some reason, too. <br />Stop Crying your Eyes Out: <BR>Well, here we have the most Beatley and the only real ballad on the album.  Nice etherial, trippy feel to it.   The song really holds well together.  But again the refrain is JUST like Dont go Away with a slightly different melody.  Its a bit like Whatever and Dont Look Back in Anger-same chords with different melodies. <br />Little by Little:  <BR>One of the best songs on the album.  I really like the verse-lyrics and melody.  However, this song could have been improved had Noel only given it a more swooping-melodic refrain (a-la Dont Look Back in Anger).  I mean, you almost expect with the delicate verses.  The refrain is a bit too repetitive and lacks some luster.  All in all, a very good song.<br />Born on Different Cloud:  Oasis biggest and most blatant Lennon rip-off to date.  It seems as if Liam is REALLY  trying hard to sound like Lennon here.  (The reverb on the voice and drum are very Phil Spector, Lennons producer) The talkingto myself again has a bit of McCartney shining through, as well.  To top it off, the slide guitar solo is SO George Harrison (a-la My Sweet Lord).  Perhaps Oasis tip of the hat to the late Beatle?  <br />It seems as if Noel has run out of ideas.  This record might have been more of a group effort than any of the previous Oasis records, and one certainly has to congratulate Liam on his first successful attempt at song-writing, but all of this doesnt ensure an album worthy of Oasis past work.   All in all, Heathen Chemistry is an album that manages to hold together but lacks the brilliance that made Oasis mid-to-late 90s material so good.
0767903862|4.0|This is an enjoyable read.  It combines huge treks with lots of interesting scientific and historical background.  On annoying thing is Bryson always seems to be trying to get as much in the middle of nowhere as possible.  He delights in being thousands of kilometers from any trace of civilization. Evidently, there are lots of places in Australia that fit the bill. Bryson seems to regret he couldn't reach all of them.
B000068TP0|5.0|This album  was released before her now 4x platinum album Laundry Service, I really loved LS but enjoy more Shakira singing in Spanish its like more natural for me to hear but her new CD is Awesome too, now back with this review, this album (MTV Unplugged earn Shakira 1 Grammy and 2 Latin Grammys, this DVD includes songs from her Cds Pies Descalzos and Donde estan los ladrones? One thing that enjoy about this DVD is that you can see the concert and you can put english subtitles to the lyrics so u can understand what she's singing and get the feelin' of each song, the music is so awesome. If U R a new Shakira fan that just know her Laundry Service songs I recommend u this DVD and also the other cds, u might enjoy it even more than LS, if u like LS you'll love MTV Unplugged and Donde Estan los Ladrones?. SHAKIRA ROCKS!!
B000002GGU|3.0|Now this is an album that brings me back to my high school days.  Actually, I bought this album as a birthday gift for my sister (I believe it was her 12th), and as was the case with most of the audio gifts that I would buy her (at her request, for all you cynics out there), I committed it to tape and entered it into my tape collection forthwith...<br />My memories of the songs from this album actually come from the radio...I believe I started listening to pop radio towards the end of 1983 or beginning of 1984, which is very close to the time that this album was released.  Whenever I would scroll through the radio stations, I would almost always stop when &quot;Heaven&quot; or &quot;Summer of '69&quot; would come on...Very good memories of this period, indeed...and that is one of the things that I think popular music is about, at least for me...That is, songs evoke certain eras in my own life, so there's a big personal connection.<br />As far as the album as a whole goes, it's something of a mixed bag...The singles are excellent - &quot;Run To You&quot;, &quot;Heaven&quot; and &quot;Summer of '69&quot; are all highlights and are notable for the great sound of Bryan Adams' lead guitarist whose name escapes me...Whoever it is, I've always loved the lead guitar sound on all of Bryan Adams' albums that I own...I also really love &quot;It's Only Love&quot;, the great duet with Tina Turner which really rocks out.  The rest of the songs here I can take or leave...They are all pretty much straight ahead rock-and-roll without too much interesting going on...This, of course, detracts from the album as a whole.  <br />So, there are four 5-star songs on this album, which is a goodly number of great songs for one album...However, the rest of the album is unexciting at best...I think this album is BETTER THAN AVERAGE, BUT ONLY JUST...I would give this 3.25 stars, but that option is not available, so I must round down to 3.  I would look for a greatest hits album for the highlights, or just borrow someone else's copy...
068484267X|5.0|McCourt shows that there is humor in just about anything in this <BR>novel, and he does so by inviting you into the mind of a child. <BR>The humor of exceedingly sad passages is accomplished by <BR>bringing about an understanding of the young Frank McCourt's <BR>analysis of the situation, often innocent, often insightful, <BR>often both. One of the sad parts of this book, at least to me, <BR>is the gradual losing of innocence as the book progresses, <BR>particularly in the final third or so. We want the main <BR>character to remain the lovable child he was at the beginning of <BR>the story, but he does not. That's because we're dealing with <BR>real life, not a fairy tale. Life just doesn't always work out <BR>that way, and that's something we either accept or we wind up in <BR>a dream-world. How many of our own life stories would fit in <BR>with the sensibilities of all of their readers? Over all, a very <BR>compelling read, especially the unabridged audio edition read by <BR>the author.
B000005GYI|5.0|This album is a masterpiece.  If you are already a fan of Brazilian music, you must add this gem to your collection.  If you've never heard Brazilian music, and don't know where to start, this is it.  Milton Nascimento has a stunning voice, and his songs are lyrical, soulful,  filled with emotion.  The arrangements are polished, but always surprising.  The best cuts on this album will have you singing along, even if you don't know a word of Portuguese.  I can't recommend this one highly enough.
B000067CPX|5.0|The Chili Peppers have once again taken their sound to the next level. Of their 8 albums, this is definitely one of the best crafted, and certainly the most song/melody-based. <br />(for a little history)Their previous albums were as follows:<br />1984 - Self-titled debut <BR>1985 - Freaky Styley<BR>1987 - Uplift Mofo Party Plan<BR>1989 - Mother's Milk<BR>1991 - BloodSugarSexMagik<BR>1995 - One Hot Minute<BR>1999 - Californication<br />    The self-titled debut and Freaky Styley were both funky, horn/bass albums with a lot of fast rapping and chanting. The George Clinton production was obvious on Freaky Styley. I love them both. The Uplift Mofo Party Plan brought a bit more guitar with it, along with some more variation between the songs. It was a bit more accessible than the first two, seemed a bit more mainstream. Still great. Kiedis' vocals seemed a bit more impassioned/urgent. A mainstream sound finally started leaking into their music with Mother's Milk. (Of course, I wasn't born until the year Uplift Mofo Party Plan was released, but I am appreciating all of this music after the fact). Mother's Milk traded a lot of the chili's trademark funk for yet more guitar riffs and some more articulate rapping... even a little singing. Plus it has a pretty little ditty entitled \\"Pretty Little Ditty,\\" from which Crazytown sampled that hook for butterfly. BloodSugarSexMagik, the '91 classic, brought funk to the big mainstream, and it was FUNKY. Funk + rap + sex + under the bridge... amazing. One Hot Minute was a departure. John had left, Dave Navarro was onboard, and this cd was a bit of a misfit. Anthony has said it was a bad time, but no matter how different it was from their other stuff, this will always be a great cd. As I cannot describe it, you will merely have to listen to it for yourself. Californication is something of a little brother to By the Way, but it is nearly perfect in that compromise. It has the funk of its old days, along with bits of the rap and Kiedistrademark delivery, but it also introduced some passionate singing and beautiful vocals that we'd never seen before from Anthony. By the Way takes that a step further. The rapping is virtually gone, and the entire album is sung. As it is, it is awesome. The choruses and melodies are gorgeous; not only infectious but compelling and pretty. The riffs are not as recognizable as they used to be, and the bass is nowhere near as up-front and abrasive. But this is just the new stage in their evolution. They are already 20 years old, and it excites me to think that they will continue to grow and make music. They are becoming more mature and their sound is as well.
0452282152|5.0|You don't have to be an art enthusiast, or even know who Veermer is and his importance to painting in order to appreciate this novel. \\"Girl With A Pear Earring\\" transcends its focus on painting and the painter himself  and reaches higher levels, when it is about love, duty and rendemption.<br />Sixteen year-old Griet has a simple Dutch life in the middle XVII Century until one day things change forever. She is assigned to work at the Veermer  family's house. At first she is not happy to leave her family to live with strangers and, to make things worse for her, catholics. She does only small things, like going to the market, washing clothes; but her importance increases when she becomes the maid who cleans the room where the painter works. She must clean everything without removing them from their original place. She develops a methode of measuring using hands, arms, and many others parts of her body. With time, she is one of the few people allowed to enter into that room. As we all suspect, she becomes friend of the painter, despite his sense of reservation. This leads them both to events that will change their lives, and many others'.<br />Tracy Chevalier has done a remakable job when writing this novel. It is undeniable that she made a huge ammount of research about not only the painter, but also Dutch life in the XVII Century. She reacreats the set so perfectly that it is impossible not believe that things were the exactly way she describes. The details are impressive: the market, the streets and houses, eveything is exaustive described but that doesn't necessarily mean a boring description. Tracy's writing is alive and colorful.<br />Another point well explored in this novel is Veermer's paintings. While she describes his process of painting, readers can easily picture him setting the scene, preparing to paint, and, even, the painting process itself. Then again, her research about his methods, his material is impressive and very accurate. And Griet is not the only model that comes to life in this novel. Some other paintings done by him in the same period are `explained', and the models become charaters in the novel.<br />The narrative is told by Griet, so she is the character that we know more. She describes her life, family, duty and even a love affair. In her 16 year-old mind, things are seen by a peculiar point of view. Her `text' is easy as it is supposed to be, once she also barely knows how to write. The painter has a very important role in her life. He helps her in her coming of age -- depiste that none of them is aware of it. The painter is a very mysterious character. His family -- mainly wife and kids -- is much more the characterzation than real life people, but I don't think it is a problem, once it is a very young girl who is trying to describe them.<br />As I aforementioned, you don't need to know Veermer, or have seen his paintings, the book is a work of fiction, and can be read as it is. It is a novel about love, courage, fear and rendenption.<br />All in all, reading this book is so enjoyable as seeing the paint. Chevalier's work may not be as close to perfection as Veermer's, but her novel is superb and it amazingly deliveries as a piece of fiction.

B00005QB42|5.0|When I walked into a local shop and heard this music, I stopped - almost frozen in my tracks... afraid that if I breathed I would miss something.  Someone on here wrote &quot;not as passionate as the cover suggests&quot;?  I can't believe anyone would think that of this CD.  It's the kind of music that opens you up and spills into you and through you.  No matter how often I listen to it - I never tire of the songs.<br />I heard that Deva Premal does American tours occasionally, and I plan to be there if she comes through my town. :)

B000021YQV|3.0|For a mainstream band, System of a Down really isn't that bad. Although their debut has more interesting songs, and is a lot better, Toxicity still has some good stuff to offer. \\"Chop Suey!\\" and \\"Aerials\\" are probably the two best songs on the radio right now, and I like the transtions between folk and metal in them. \\"Prison Song\\" and \\"Bounce\\" are both insane, like songs on the first CD, and \\"ATWA\\" never fails to depress me. While all the songs I've mentioned are good, I can't exactly say the same about the rest of the album. Some songs (\\"Needles,\\" \\"Forest,\\" etc.) are extremely boring and annoy me to death. Oh well, it's mainstream music. I wouldn't exactly expect the sort of brilliance demonstrated by In Flames and Neurosis to be found in the mainstream. So if you want to buy this CD, go ahead. It's better than Linkin Park. Just know that there are underground bands out there that are a million times better than these guys...
B00003W8NM|5.0|... Brad Pitt.  I hate to say it, but the man is an extremely talented actor.  Ocean's Eleven, Snatch, Fight Club, Seven...all amazing flicks.  But I'll tell you...Fight Club is the best movie ever made.  Here are eight reasons why:<br />1) You cannot categorize this movie, it's everything.  It's action, it's drama, it's supsenseful as anything in some parts, it's funny, and it's horrifyingly graphic.  <br />2) I've noticed something different all 123258005 times I have watched it.  I know, I know, the number is what I like to call an exaggeration.  But seriously, I have picked up something new that makes the plot even more extreme each time I have watched it.  ... I have seen this movie probably at least 150 times, seriously.  I am so sad.<br />3) It's brilliant.  All these people keep bashing it as dangerous and demented.  How about thought-provoking?  How about a new angle on the world?  How about a message to go against everything you believe and just listen?  How about the fact that there's millions of movies like that with those themes, but Fight Club does it differently?<br />4) Edward Norton is my favorite actor.  It's just a piece of the puzzle.  Ever since I saw American History X, I knew that this guy was for real.  You wanna know why he gets almost zero publicity?  He chooses not to.  He thinks it would interfere with how you saw his characters if you knew the real him.  Wow, now that is conviction to your career.<br />5) The soundtrack is the finest soundtrack that any movie has put out.  The only soundtracks that come close are Terminator II and The Mothman Prophecies.  <br />6) This movie was flawlessly written.  If I could write a movie like this, you wouldn't see me critiquing someone else's genius on this website.<br />7) The pure fairy boy gets destroyed.  Usually, fairy boys win.  The fairy boy in this movie...how he looks after the...well, watch it.  You'll see what I mean.<br />8) David Fincher is brilliant.  Um, that's all.  <br />Watch this movie, and your brain will hate you the first time you watch it.  But isn't that supposed to be what watching movies is about?  Stimulation that interests your eyes and your brain?  Please watch this.  Do yourself a favor and buy it.  Don't just rent it.  I know one person that hates this movie, but he hasn't seen it, so that should tell you something.
B00005JKNC|4.0|it's like this: you either love or hate jim carrey.<br />i happen to love him.<br />i caught this movie while on a long distance flight, and it was well worth the time i spent NOT sleeping. he had showed that he can do more than just \\"dumb and dumber\\" and \\"ace ventura\\" routine with \\"the truman show\\"... but i think that this movie cemented the fact. although both truman and majestic aren't exactly serios material, they nonetheless dissect the human psyche with admirable frankness.<br />usually when talking about the 50's people will think of a rather quaint time but i think this movie conveys the certain grimness of that era. some might say that this movie doesn't really develop the premise of the \\"communism-paranoia\\" but i beg to differ. it *is* rather corny at the ending, but other than that, issues like what happens to families after the war, honesty, freedom and privacy of the people are well portrayed.<br />this is a good movie for a rainy day, or when you need something that is light BUT not totally devoid of any message.<br />i highly recommend this movie to anyone.

The title track is catchy and was an instant radio hit, and the other songs are equally rockin'. \\"The Zephyr Song\\" has a great beat, and it's just as catchy as \\"Throw Away Your Television.\\" A lot of the songs are soft rock, but \\"Cabron\\" is a cool Spanish-sounding song that mixes up the variety of tracks. It's an awesome CD and I recommend it to anyone who likes the Red Hot Chili Peppers--you won't be sorry!
B00005YXZH|5.0|Here's the story:  Reprise drops band after this album was recorded, waves any debts to get them off the label, gives them the master tapes, another label owned by the same parent company pays them more money to release the album, album debuts in the top 20. On that alone, it should be &quot;album of the year 2002&quot; but it's the music/lyrics/performances that is going to keep it there.
B00005B36H|5.0|After bying this album late last year it has become a proven fact that Tool are the best musicians out there. Having played great shows for a decade, albums that are more musical than the last, and proving that artist should be heard but, not seen this band has hit me on many levels and are now my favorite band! Tool is a band that has created a new type of music that no one can describe. They are not a mix of any music. Having brought there own thing into music this is a band that will be around for a long time. They have created some of the best songs of all time and some of the coolest and strangest music videos as well. The video I saw that made me go out and buy this great album is the video for Schism. It was the first Tool video and song that I had ever heard. After buying the album Lateralus I took it home listened to it and just found out how great an album it was! You can tell that Tool spent alot of time working on this album. Buy Lateralus, write a review about it, and enjoy!

0385720920|3.0|Fight club was great.  It was innovative, fresh, new, and exciting.  None of Chuck Palahniuk's other books have been able to live up to this high standard.  He rehashes himself over and over again.  Using the same phrases, the same style, and (basically) the same characters over and over again.<br />In Choke, we see another misfit of society attending &quot;anonymous&quot; meetings to meet girls, scamming the members of productive society, and barely surviving on the fringes of life.  Sound familiar?  With another assortment of insane characters to back him up, the protagonist goes through a life-altering event and is &quot;reborn&quot; at the end of the novel to continue on in his unproductive, weird life.  YAWN.<br />I keep reading Palahniuk in hopes that I will again find something fresh and new as there was in Fight Club.. and I again am disappointed.  This author's crazy rantings are humorous, entertaining, and a quick read, but the benefits don't go beyond that.  If you need a fun, summer beach book, read this.  If you're looking for something more... don't.
B00003W8NM|1.0|I can admit that the performances in this movie were very well acted and I can see how some people do like this movie alot, however I am not one of these people.  Even though I don't like the movie.  I can't get over the subject matter of the film.  I have an open mind and love thought provoking movies of all kind such as Mullholand Drive, however this movie left a bad taste in my mouth.  People say in their reviews that corporate America has conformed our society, but are we not free to live in any way that we chose and try and make a living the way we see fit.  All this movie advocates is conformity and violence.  It says that it is ok to get your point across through violence and torture.  If this movie were trying to show this in the way of a black comedy, I could get past its subject manner, however there was no attempt at comedy in the entire movie.  All of the members of Fight Club had no original ideas of their own and behaved like drones similarly to a socialist rebuplic.  This movie seemed to praise socialism and bash capitalism.  If you watch this movie, I think you will see why socialism will never work and why we live in a capitalist society.  The movie teaches lessons and makes points that have been blatenly clear for some time.  I think there are very good ideas here, but the way they were portrayed in this movie is not for all tastes.
0380820846|3.0|I really wanted Penelope and Colin to get together, and I adore the Bridgerton family. I re-read parts in other books just because they make me laugh. While the Bridgerton family was in full force throughout this book, it seemed replayed.  Colin's trauma just semed like a replay of Benedict's problems. The way the relationship with Penelope and Colin moved, was a little flat as well. I expected something like the other three books, origianl and witty. Instead, Colin randomly seems to decide he loves Penelope. Their conversations are interesting, but their romance is not. Plus, frankly, Lady Whistledown was a let down. I think Ms. Quinn could have made it more creative. I will definitely read more books by her, and pre-order the next Bridgerton book. But I was most definitely dissapointed
B00005A1PR|3.0|This album isn't really as great as they say it is. Believe it or not. It's filled with bunch of slow songs. It's ok I guess. But I wouldn't give it a five. It's in the middle, 3. It's a relaxing type of music. If you like that then I guess it's for you. I only like the instruments and slow smooth sounds. Though it may make some of you fall asleep like some of you have mentioned earlier. I do recommend it to others however, as it is good. People have different tastes. I suggest you listen to it before you decide to buy it. If you don't like it atleast you won't complain on having wasted your money since you won't, but if you do like it then I'm sure you know what to do. I don't love it but I like it. That's all I can say. Your choice.
B000067CPX|1.0|Anyone who appreciates the Peppers' funk/punk/surf/party music aren't going to think very highly of By The Way. Personally, I liked the carefree, non-sensical lyrics the Peppers churned out in the 80's and early 90's. The &quot;maturity&quot; (read: OLD) they hinted at in Californication songs like Porcelain is in full force here and it bores the hell out of me. The album might be considered good if it were by a band like Nickelback, but in comparison to the Peppers' other works, I consider the album a disappointment and won't be leaving it my CD player. If this is the direction the guys want to go, you can count this fan out. Their career may continue, but the party is over for the Red Hot Chili Pepper's...too bad...
B000067CPX|5.0|This CD is absolutely the best album I have ever heard.  Every single track (I'm I'm not lying here)is beautiful.  Some great tracks would be the funky &quot;By the Way&quot; and &quot;Minor Thing&quot;.  But the Chili Peppers don't just stop at making great tracks; they easily ascend to creating perfect tracks with &quot;The Zephyr Song&quot;, &quot;This is the Place&quot; and the greatest song I have ever heard, &quot;Tear&quot;.  Normally, I'm into heavier stuff such as Ozzy, System of A Down, and Black Label Society, but &quot;Tear&quot; moved me in a way no song ever has.  I was stressed about college and life in general but &quot;Tear&quot; made me forget my troubles and want to enjoy life.  The same goes for the rest of the CD.  To me, the Chili Peppers created a very spiritual record that will go down as easily my favorite record of all time.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I was surprised that the editorial reviews of this film treat it like just another film, which it most definitely IS NOT. I would describe it in various ways: as the film John Waters would give his left HAND to make; as a terrific NEAR-sendup of intense, tear-drenched dramatic dance films like Red Shoes, that doffs its hat to the concept of \\"camp\\" without throwing the whole experience away just to stay consistent with the attitude; as a comedy that, if you get the joke, will knock you silly with laughter at times.<br />There are moments when I wasn't sure which film I was in, as the plot listed toward Flashdance and then Cinderella. But this is the kind of film it is; it embraces operatic emotion and high melodrama, and while it acknowledges the ordinary, it never becomes so. And it communicates beautifully the essential wackiness of all in-bred, inclusive subcultures. (The old guard's constant exhortations to the hero not to give himself over to \\"crowd-pleasing moves\\" is hilariously absurd, and at the same time wholly typical of such subcultures, where the most sensible question is always \\"Who on earth made these up these rules?!\\")<br />It is an odd and intense film, one that contantly keeps you off balance, and asking yourself whether to take it seriously or as an elaborate sort of filmed comedy dream (think of Rocky Horror Picture Show). The cool thing is, you never have to decide; you can enjoy new aspects of it on multiple viewings. See it.

0380820846|5.0|Penelope Featherington has been in love with Colin Bridgerton ever since she first came to town, 12 years earlier. Colin does not really notice her in a romantic sense though until Penelope begins to feel confident enough to let her true self out show.<br />Penelope has spent her entire life as the plain one, the plump one, the one whom her mother thought would take care of her in her old age. Colin has spent his life adored by everyone, but restless as only a third son can be in Ton life. They are the perfect match for each other -- it just takes Colin a while to figure that out and Penelope a while to believe enough in herself to see it.<br />This was such a fun romance, with two likeable characters who had chemistry between them. In so many romances it is difficult to see why the heroine would ever want to be with the hero or vice versa. One is usually an insensitive brooding clod and the other an idiot who spouts of platitudes about women's rights, but loves it when her man treats her mean.<br />Julia's characters are not maniacal idiots, and it is always a joy to read her books.
0062502182|5.0|This is one of those books that is a very enjoyable and a quick read.  As far as a page turner, I finished it in a few days and found myself eager to get to the next page.  The story is wonderfully colorful and blends a nice travel story with moral lessons.  It's a timeless read, 7 year old to a 70 year old will all find it enjoyable.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This movie explores the congnition of John Nash (Russell Crowe), a mathematical genius.

6301661737|5.0|When Kurosawa made this film he was 70 years old and it stands without question as one of his best films.  What makes it so powerful is the portrayal of the perfect fusion of the warrior's emotional intensity with intellectual acuity.  Both emotion and intellect are focused solely, in this film, on enemy warlords outwitting each other and that focus is so strong that it more than carries the film through its 2 1/2 hour length.<br />In fact, so strong is the focus that the hapless title character (the shadow warrior)--a common thief who is a perfect lookalike for a mighty warlord, who recruits the thief and is then used by the warlord's retainers as a stand-in after the warlord's death--himself ultimately takes on the psychology of a warrior.  And this is true even after he is dismissed from service, after the ordained three years of his deception as the warlord have passed.<br />Nowhere else in film has the psychology of the warrior been portrayed so sharply, with so much focus, with so much depth--not even in other Kurosawa films, although Seven Samurai is the sine qua non of samurai films.  Yet here, in Kagemusha, we see the workings of the minds on both sides, whereas Seven Samurai's power comes from its depiction of how samurais use their intelligence to fight and outwit a completely insubstantial enemy--that is, the bandits, who are never shown up close or presented as anything other than marauding forces.<br />Kagemusha will never be equalled in its portrayal of the intensity of the warrior spirit.  Add to that the astounding vision of a filmmaker who knows more than any other how, where, and why a battle scene's power is derived.  As well, there is perfect production design, costuming, and set pieces.  There is the obvious attention to detail in capturing the entire world of feudal Japan.  All of these together make for a film so riveting, so well done, it is impossible to say anything bad about the film.  It just can't be done.<br />This is a must see for all serious students of film, and for all those who love a great adventure, and for all those who just flat out love movies.<br />It's perfect.l serious students of film, and for all those who love a great adventure, and for all those who just flat out love movies.<br />It's perfect.
B000068QVN|5.0|There  was  a  time  (late  60's,  early  70's)  when  music  inspired  people  to  dream, get  one  thru  tough  times  in  life  etc. We went  on  a  \\"journey\\"  with  our  favorite  band  as  they  played  their music,  which  came  straight  from  their  heart. Grand  Funk  was  one  of  a  few  power  rock  trio's  that  took  one  to  the  top  of  the   \\"emotional mountain\\". Their  music was  played  with such GREAT  intensity  in  concert that  they lifted  your  soul.  This  CD is  like  no  other,  because  it  captures  the  \\"magic\\"  of  a  Grand  Funk  concert.  Young  rocker's  who  want  to  hear  the  way  rock  sould  be  played  should buy  this  \\"Live '71\\". The  remastering  work  done  by  David  K. Tedds  and  his  team  is  nothing short of  pure genius. I tip  my  hat to  Capitol  for  giving  us  music  fans  a  chance  to  relive  rock the  way  I remember  it being  played,  LOUD  AND PROUD,  which  is  the  only  way  Grand  Funk  played  live. So,  get on  board  this  \\"Time  Machine\\",  and  let  Grand  Funk  rock you  like no one  else  could...
B000066NW0|5.0|I have recently been going through a really tough time in my life. One i thought i wouldnt be able to overcome. but avril lavigne's album has not only inspired me to move on, but to think of what a day would be like with out anything you own, like your bed, a house, or even your friends. sounds rough huh? you shouldn't take anything for granted, life is a very beutiful thing, and this album can be an inspiration to anyone who has gone through a little bump in the road, to just keep driving.
6305622914|5.0|I had a hard time convincing a friend of mine, one of the biggest film buffs of all time, to watch this movie. Being a red-blooded American male he said he had no desire to \\"see a bunch of men stripping.\\" This is so far from the core and truth of this movie. To me, the Full Monty is about regaining pride and dignity and a sense of self when one has been robbed of one's livelihood. The movie would be even more timely today, in the wake of the felling of corporate giants and the transplanting of manufacturing to other countries. It shows the pervasive nature of unemployment; how it wrecks one's relationships and takes a toll on one's energy and psyche. It answers questions close to all men's hearts: Is a man a man without a job? Can a man separate his working self from his romantic and other selves? If one has been a boss, a leader, are those qualities still there when one is no longer in charge? When the beauracratic labels have been stripped away, can the men be friends? <br />Lest I make this sound too serious, take it from me that this movie strikes a very loving and warmhearted, goofy tone, and as everyone says, the sound track propels the viewer into a state of euphoria that lasts throughout the movie. I thought when I first saw it that I'd remember it only as that year's sleeper, but years later it remains one of my favorite movies. See it and enjoy it. Don't be put off (or too excited by) the stripping angle-you won't see much bare skin, only bare, honest emotions.
0451196716|5.0|It's been over a year since I read The Long Walk and it still makes me think.  By reading the plot, you'd think it would get boring but King always seems to have something for us.  It reads like a really long short story and I believe it is that that I love the most.  Its story is simple yet holds so much meaning.  Some have said that it deals with mordern day athletics.  I saw it as a take on the military.<br />I was wanting to join the army before I read this.  Though I still kind of want to, it made me think twice.  The boys joined the walk for grandure and pride.  Many young people join the military for the same reason.  But, the truth is that in the long walk, you die.  If you win you go crazy.  Sounds a lot like going to War.  What starts with pride and honor ends in blood and regret. <br />The whole book was good.  The end left me dissapointed a little.  I believe I understood it when I read it but didn't really want to think that was it.  Over time I realized I was right.  There could only be one end to that story, its not one we want to see but somewhere you knew it was coming.  Just like those boys.  Anyway, the rest of the book was so great and well written that it is still my favorite King.  I think it is better than The Shining.  Well maybe not better.  The Shining has so much more to it, but The Long Walk is still my very favorite.  Its the kind of book I'll probably read over and over and then give it to my future son to read.  I loved it, every page.
B000066C6Z|5.0|Top Secret was made back in 1984 when satire and parody hadn't been run into the ground.  Still, this movie is as fresh and funny as any of today's flicks in the genre (some jokes are a bit dated).  I can't wait for the deleted scenes, trailers and commentary on the DVD.  This movie is just as good as Airplane and the Naked Gun, but bombed at the theaters.
B00005M6AP|5.0|Call this the Scorpions version of an MTV Unplugged album. You CANT go wrong with this one. Meine's vocals really stand out. Versions of several well-known numbers here are just great. The arrangement of \\"rock you like a hurricane\\" is interesting. The cover of Queen's \\"love of my life\\" is good, and this is coming from a die-hard Queen fan. It makes you wish Freddie was still here to have done this himself. Also covered is Kansas' \\"dust in the wind\\" - and likewise, having seen Kansas live, I can say this version does justice to it, I prefer this up-tempo one. Aside from some hits, the lesser known (to most americans) songs here are executed nicely. This CD scores as many points as their orchestral rock album \\"moment of glory\\". Buy it.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Is it derivative? Possibly. Does it matter? Perhaps. So what's the point? Well, quite frankly, it's got to be one of the sexyest new releases in the last several years.

Sure, these young punks make music like they were the first generation to discover sex, but hey, they DO perform. Is this IT? yes, and a lot more...
0609610570|3.0|The typical, though well written, common sense that any farmer or housewife knows.

Write follow up letters? Is that like sending a thank you card? &quot;Thank you for doing your job, yeah, the one we pay you for, oh, if your work is not completed get right on it ok?&quot; Here's my two cents,(about what my opinions worth),Know your business,,NOT what every other business is doing, have pride as a manager in your product, and your people. Question everything, including your CEO, if you are a CEO,and your entity is bleeding capitol, loosing market share, laying off talent, think; &quot;am I doing my job?&quot; If the plumer can't fix the leak in your bathroom, should he be paid?

B000067CPX|5.0|I have only heard a few songs.  Dosed, Tear, Minor Thing, and Venice Queen.  They are all excellent.  Sounds like an evolution from Californication...with much more melodic playing.  Guitar sounds really good also.  Honestly, with the exception of a few moments, this sounds like an entirely new RHCP...takes Californication to a new level.
0553260111|4.0|Robert Ludlum did a fantastic job coming up with a unique story. The book opens with Jason Bourne taking a bullet in the head on a boat in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. He is rescued from the stormy waters by a group of fishermen who take him to the local doctor. The doctor repairs our man's wounds and nurses him back to health. When Bourne is finally awakes from his comma, he discovers that he doesn't remember a thing, not even his name. The doctor starts Bourne on his journey with a piece of microfilm with a Swiss bank account number on it, and the realization that Bourne's features have been changed recently by surgery and that he speaks three languages. We also find out that Bourne is deadly in the arts of hand-to-hand combat. If this isn't enough to get you reading, it's time to find a different genre of books to pursue. <br />Ludlum is a strong writer in the action, deception, and overall plot sense. Unfortunately, he is terrible at character interactions. The female character, Marie St. Jacques, and Bourne feel as if they were forced together by the author because it was the only way the story would work. There is very little tension between the two of them, even when she was with him against her will. She is also entirely too bright, able to guess many of the things from Bourne's past. I think Ludlum was concerned that his audience might lose their way, and Marie was there to give them the inside scoop. My only other complaint about the book is Bourne's ability to attract bullets. He has more holes in him than most cheeses. <br />The plot is good. There are several areas were it is a little weak, but the momentum of the book carries you through these areas before you realize that there is something wrong with it. This is a very good action thriller that will keep you reading well past your bedtime. Ludlum let's on Bourne's past in such a way that you keep reading to find out more about him. The Bourne character is fairly well developed, with quite a history behind him even though we only see it in brief glimpses. Bourne is a good problem solver and great manipulator. We learn a lot of Bourne's motivation even though we never quite understand what is behind the other characters' actions. <br />This seems like it might have been originally a complete book, but someone got the idea that this could easily be turned into a series. Therefore, the ending isn't as strong as it could be, leaving obvious gaps to be answered in the subsequent books. This is one of the better books that I've read in a long while. I do recommend it.
0679457607|5.0|\\"The Inner Game of Golf\\" has been on bookstore shelves for 20 years because it appeals to a segment of the golfing public that eschews traditional instruction.  It is not a book about how to play golf; it is a book about how to learn golf.  The author's approach is a straightforward application of Eastern psychology and targets the subconscious mind of the golfer as the primary player of the game.  Most of the methods described in the book are directed toward quieting the conscious (verbal) mind so that the subconscious (non-verbal) mind can learn from experience.  <br />Here's an example.  In the traditional approach to playing the game, the golfer watches the flight of the ball after contact and deduces from it how he must have swung.  From that information he makes mechanical corrections that are applied to the next swing.  In the Inner Game approach, the golfer does not watch, but feels the flight of the ball after contact.  From this feedback the subconscious mind automatically makes corrections that are applied to subsequent shots.  For me, the former approach has always led to frustration.  Driving range corrections always fall apart after 3 holes on the course, and mechanical analyses lead to doubt.  But with the Inner Game approach, my swing gets stronger thru the round, and I hit with greater and greater confidence as the round progresses.  It is often a confident feeling that I carry with me for many hours after leaving the course.  In that respect, a round of golf early in the morning is, like meditation, a conditioner for the daily activities that follow.<br />This updated version of \\"The Inner Game of Golf\\" is a substantial revision of the original, and owners of the 1981 edition may well want to consider buying the update.  While several sections remain untouched, there is fresh material inserted throughout as well as a couple of completely new chapters.  But the most significant revision is one of tone.  Gone is the enthusiastic arrogance of the original which aggressively promoted the Inner Game approach as superior to traditional teaching methods.  Indeed, the 1981 version flatly stated that Inner Game techniques should not be used in conjunction with traditional methods.  While this tone may have helped elevate the book to its cult status, it ultimately turned off the serious golfing community to the point where the author's name is rarely mentioned by traditional golf instructors.  In the revision, the author changes direction completely and now says that the inner game approach should be merged with traditional instruction to create a new, synthesized approach to learning.  He even offers a few techniques for achieving such a synthesis.<br />But, what hasn't changed is the author's central thesis that it is the golfer's understanding of why he plays the game that leads to both success with the sport and contentment as a result of it.  The reader who understands and accepts this fundamental concept will find himself transformed in a way he would never have predicted from a mere golf book.
B00005RIKD|2.0|I am a big fan of Sting and usually enjoy it when re re-fashions his songs so that they present new styles and dimensions.  But this album was a disappointment.  His re-working of Fragile, for instance, makes it so light as to float into insignificance.  Many of the other songs are similarly inferior to their previous versions.  The whole album has a feel of a lack of energy, like he woke up one day and figured he would fool around with his songs rather than putting the time and energy into crafting appealing alternative versions.
0380820846|3.0|I'm surprised by all the five-star reviews.  This is a fair read.  Colin and Penelope are engaging characters and it *is* fun to read about them again.  However, the book drags down in so many places I found myself wondering if publishers don't hire editors anymore.  Really, some of the conversations re. Lady Whistledown's identity and Colin's angst over a lack of purpose were plain insipid.
0385505833|3.0|I skipped reading this last Christmas and happened upon it in an old stack in the basement. Took it to the pool along with Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin (truly extraordinary!) and enjoyed a light read. Somewhat comical at times, but not very engaging. I'd say skip it if you haven't already read this and stick with new authors like Martin and Jeffrey Lent.
B000067CPX|4.0|No surprises as the chilis pull out an 'ageing gracefully' album, but it's very appropriate for their stage. Considering their are 16 tracks, you'd expect a few to be dodgy (throw away your tv, on mercury comes to mind), but the good tracks certainly outweigh the bad. Highlights include the Zepher Song, Can't Stop and Venice Queen. The album sounds like californication mixed by a romantic guy on acid. That, of course, is a good thing. Slow ballads, ska, synths are mixed with the traditional californian sound, to create an album well worth the wait.
B000034CCH|5.0|The review's title contains an allusion to one of the lovely ballads on this disc (and all but one composition is by the vibist.)  \\"Bouquet\\" is a graceful and heartfelt tune that unfolds slowly in its waltz-like time.  \\"When You Are Near\\" is a somewhat less brooding, compressed composition.  Both are terrific examples of Hutcherson's use of space and texture to stir the emotions.  The Penguin guide folks spoke the truth when they said Hutch would be a major figure if he played a front-line instrument.   The non-Hutcherson tune is Herbie Hancock's \\"Maiden Voyage\\" and the pianist on the date is Mr. Hancock.  Sometimes,(on other discs,)the sound of vibes and piano is cluttered, but these men are masters.  Hancock is joyous on this 1966 recording and he truly swings on this, above all tunes.  Credit must also be given to Bob Cranshaw on bass,and Joe Chambers on drums.  Both are inherently melodic players (check out Joe's compositions on the Hutcherson dates \\"Dialogue\\" and \\"Patterns.\\")  Chambers can \\"groove you to death,\\" while you try to hum his part.  The Latin feel tune \\"Rojo\\" and the avant-garde \\"The Omen\\" are two other standouts.  Actually, there is not a single lame note on the entire recording.  I found a Japanese edition of this disc on vacation in Seattle and grabbed it so fast it was scary.
B0000027RL|5.0|Ten is one of Pearl Jam's best records, if not THE best. It was a great way to make themselves known. It has some of their most known songs (and some over-played) such as Jeremy, Even Flow, and Alive. Even though they may be a bit over-played, I still enjoy them. However, there are also other fantastic songs that are not so well known (and should probably be more well known)including Release, Porch, Deep, Once, and basically the rest of the cd. <BR>  Pearl Jam expresses so much talent in this Cd, at least as much as their following albums. I know that I am disagreeing with many by saying this, but they posses far more talent than all of their inferior wannabes (CREED, Nickleback, Puddle of Mudd). They right MUCH better lyrics, and they have personality. In 10 years, no one will remember the name of Creed's lead singer (and I am proud to say that I dont know it now), but everyone oevr the age of 30 will know who Eddie Vedar is. They aslo have their own sound.  Even though SOundgarden, Nirvana, Mother Love Bone, and Temple of the Dog are all considered \\"grunge\\" you can tell them apart, and their songs. All of the grunge wannabes ( the whole Seattle grunge thing was 10 years ago anyways, a little late aren't they?) sound the same, and all of their songs have the same meaning. Pearl Jam is not like that. If you like Nickelback, you will like Puddle of Mudd. If you like Soundgarden you will probably like Pearl Jam, because they make the same type of music, but they have completely different styles, so it is not guarenteed. But I certainly enjoyed this album, and if you like any kind of grunge, I think you should buy it and give it a shot.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|It wasn't what I expected at all, I didn't want to see this movie, but now that I have I'm still kicking myself for not seeing it on the big screen.<BR>Basically, you'll love it or you'll hate it.  I loved it.  But I do understand if some people don't like it, but honestly people, if you don't like it, at least come up with a plausible reason for it.  Most of the negative reviews I've read from this sight were so baseless I was wondering if they were even watching the same movie.<BR>As for me, it's the most addicting movie I've ever seen in my life.  The music is awesome and the acting superb.  Ewan and Nicole totally blew me away with their amazing singing abilities.  But aside from all the technical break-downs of this movie, it is just simply wonderful.
B00003CXAE|5.0|I saw \\"Grease\\" when I was a child and the movie and the songs are still fresh in my mind. Watching it again, I still find myself entertained by a simple story enhanced by catchy, memorable music, likeable characters, romantic chemistry and art direction. It doesn't matter what era the film is set in; it's timeless.<br />For those who don't know, \\"Grease\\" is set in the 1950's at a California high school where Sandy has just moved to from Australia. She is reunited with her summer fling, Danny, and the two deal with their love amidst cliques, the prom, and their reputations. There's a reason why the film's popularity prevails after more than 20 years: it is a highly enjoyable movie. Marketing and hype cannot do that!
B00005LQ6S|1.0|Q: What's an Immortal?<BR>A: They are people who can't die.<BR>Q: Are they real?<BR>A: No, stupid, this is a movie.  It's made up.  Like the Easter Bunny.<BR>Q: So they can't die?<BR>A: Please clean the cabbage out of your ears, that's what I said.<BR>Q: Then how come Immortals sometimes die?<BR>A: Immortals can kill other Immortals.<BR>Q: But you said they couldn't die!  THEY said they couldn't die!<BR>A: Will you get off the \\"die\\" questions already? Wait! You're supposed to ask the questions!<BR>Q: How come all the Immortals are either hunks or models?<BR>A: Nobody is going to buy a ticket to see Rosie O'Donnel as an Immortal.  Wait.  Her audience thinks she IS an Immortal.  I may have something here for the next sequel:  Highlander-RearEndGame.<BR>Q: Why are all the Immortals always all bummed-out?<BR>A: I guess living for 500 or so years, with the ability to acquire unlimited wealth, and keeping those hunk/model good looks is just a burden too much to bear.<BR>Q: Why doesn't the movie make a shred of sense?<BR>A: Now there's an intelligent question about a very non-intelligent movie that makes no sense.  I only have one word as your answer:  sequelitis.
B000002BHE|4.0|At times, Celine Dion's over-the-top singing can be annoying but on &quot;Falling Into You&quot;, her best album to date, producers and songwriters found the perfect balance of traditional Dion ballads, mellow tunes and more upbeat tracks to make a well-rounded collection.<br />1993's &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot;, her breakthrough record in the U.S., featured Celine hitting high notes all over the place without stopping to breathe but here, there's a conscious effort to have her teasingly building up to a climax (the stellar &quot;It's All Coming Back to Me Now&quot; and &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot;) which results in the listener appreciating her vocal ability even more. Ironically, some of the best tracks are the low key love songs such as &quot;Falling Into You&quot;, &quot;Seduces Me&quot; and &quot;I Don't Know&quot;; They inhibit longing and carries Celine into R&amp;B/soul territory. The dance tunes are also worth mentioning: &quot;Make You Happy&quot;, &quot;If That's What It Takes&quot; and &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot;. Normally, dance tracks are just thrown in a Celine album to make it seem diverse but here they are up to par with the killer and not just filler.<br />I noticed the album is generally uplifting and Celine almost crosses into blues rock on a few of the upbeat songs. I recommend this for all ages whether you just want to relax or be impressed with top notch singing. There isn't anything groundbreaking here, but a lot worthwhile.
B000063S6Z|3.0|Moby is a great guy and deserves a lot of respect.  But, this album is nowhere near the level of Move, Everything Is Wrong, or Play.  There are some keepers on here, but the others are sort of boring.  They sound like...Moby, yes, but simply like everything else he's ever done.  He's definitely perfected a certain introspective feel, but it's done at the expense of creating a blindingly obvious formula: the ebbing and flowing ambience, the beats, the sampled vocal.  Even the way a few of the tracks develop is extremely predictable: &quot;Ok, cue the climax, settle it down, now only the piano.&quot;  It's definitely listenable, but almost unnecessary to do so on many of them because you've already heard it, just with interchangeable samples and central melodies.  If you're a recent Moby fan, I think you might be able to love all of 18 without being able to predict the transitions.  So definitely give this a listen, just don't expect anything too diverse or revolutionary.  For that I'm waiting for Kelli Ali's debut, the pre-release demo of which recently blew me away.
B00003CXXP|4.0|I've seen this a few times now and the voice-over is definately the weakest link. Spielberg does not seem able to do poetry, nor will he allow us a poignant moment without intruding cap in hand. The ending of this film is like attending a funeral of a much loved relative only for the funeral director to have arranged for the flowers to be delivered by an absailing SWAT team, conveniently landing on top of the coffin during the sermon. Anyone who has seen Spielberg's 'Minority Report' will not find this scenario entirely outside the bounds of possibility. Subtlety is not Steven's Forte. May I call you Steven? Oh. <BR>Also, the various 'buff' references to Kubrick's movies are in questionable taste, turning potential art into kitsch. The main flaw in this messy but compelling drama is the question of how David became the unique and enduring memory of the human race when we clearly saw dozens of other David's about to be shipped off to customers. Presumably as these would be delivered to dry land they would have had an even greater chance of surviving the big freeze than David. Mr Spielberg, I claim my fave poonds. Toss in a super toy while your at it too, please.
0446608955|5.0|I loved this book. It was incredibly moving, touching, and heartfelt. Jamie Sullivan is one of the most memorable, angelic characters I've read in a long time, and the story of the love between her and Landon will not leave my heart for a long time. <br />Nothing is more pure, innocent or beautiful then first love -- untouched by inner conflicts inflicted by past pains. The love that develops between Landon and Jamie is as pure and beautiful as love can be. <br />Jamie is a loving, caring, amazing girl. Despite her terminal illness, her perceptions of the world are filled with nothing but love and faith. Untouched by what others think of her, she is kind to everyone despite how they treat her.<br />Landon gets into typical teen age trouble and is forced to be in the school play as well as to carry out responsibilities that are a daily part of Jamie's life (volunteering and helping others). It is through these activities that these two people's lives cross, and are drawn to one another.<br />Jamie's affect on Landon is profound, and although at first his willingness to accept his feelings for her is hindered by his friends, he ultimately relents and falls for her. He emerges as a person who believes in himself, and even more so, who loves and cares for another human being with such undying strength and compassion.<br />Albeit predictable, this is a great book for teens to read who are struggling with identity and fitting in. There are lessons in this book for young and old alike, about love, faith, and compassion. And about believing in yourself.
B000002JSJ|5.0|If you don't have Presence, you should. Robert and Jimmy both point to this album as the one album that captured a moment in the bands history better than any other. They are all at their peak, especially Bonham. Listent to the drums in Hots On For Nowhere, NOBODY else could play like that. I disagree with the other reviews that say the songs sound the same. Nothing could be further from the truth! How can Tea for One sound like Candy Store Rock? Or Nobodys Fault sound like Hots On?? Makes absolutely no sense. In an interview about a month ago, Robert Plant was asked to name one Zep song he still loves. His choice?? For Your Life. He said \\"I still Love it. It has everything Zeppelin was about\\". John Bonham once barged into a Deep Purple recording session and yelled \\"what is this...? wait to you hear our new album Presence, it blows this...away and is our best album yet. This music [stinks]!\\" And walked out. Well, I don't think Purple's album [stunk], but I agree that it is their best work without one weakness.
0780620828|3.0|The plot is simple-a govt. agent is murdered before repenting his sins, is sent to Hell, and in exchange for returning to his love, will lead the forces of evil against Heaven. Once on earth, Spawn realizes the terrible consequences if he follows through and tries to redeem himself by saving the woman he loves and his daughter and killing the man who set him up and who threatens the world. <BR>An interesting plot that nevers makes it past the simple, cut and dried \\"good vs. evil\\", tone. Spawn has spent 5 years in Hell but he is still human enough to love and hate. It's his humanity that gives him grief over his promise to lead the armies of Hell. WHile he tries to overcome his promise, his struggle is more self-pitying than heroic redemption. He wanders around \\"struggling\\" with himself while fighting both human and unhuman foes. The action scenes are good and the special effects are fantastic, but the storyline and dialogue fall short. <BR>Eventually, Spawn defeats the bad guys but since he's betrayed Hell, he can't go there and Heaven won't let him in. So now, he must struggle for salvation and redemption.

B00005QDW1|4.0|I have to say this one was a little different for me. But after a good listen, I realised that I was glad I purchased it.
B00005QG9J|3.0|I find that this album is not as good as make yourself because it is a lot softer. I have both albums and i find make yourself is a lot better and heavier. Morning view is still pretty good because all of the heavier songs are good but all the other songs are soft and not that good. So, if you liked make yourself a lot you may not like this album this much, i was alittle disappointed, but it' s still good.
0671646788|5.0|This book completely has changed the way I think. An excellent book for those who think they &quot;cannot do it&quot; or those who think it is &quot;too late in life&quot;. A highly inspirational book, and gives a ton of real-life examples and rags to riches stories. If nothing, this book will be one of the best reads.
0375703764|5.0|I'm not a horror fan.  I've never had an interest in the genre at all.  I was given this book for my birthday by a friend and finally attempted to read this 700 page large trade paperback- largely so my friend would quit bugging me.<br />I'm very glad I relented and read &quot;House of Leaves&quot;.  Calling this a Horror novel is like calling &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; a cop show.  Danielewski is far too literate a writer to be pigeon-holed in on genre.  This is more like reading modern day Poe meets Borges meets postmodern with literary influences from Melville to Pynchon.<br />A book- a collage really of narratives/commentaries/appendices- about the mysterious appearance and expansion of an inner hallway/world within a house in Virginia turns into an experiment in fear and reality.  There are several layers of narration, reference to intellectual works (some real, some only invented for the story).  Even the layout of the novel is part of the plot and style- not done in an overly clever manner- but instead helping to move the story along.<br />This is a literature in the same league as Powers, Franzen and DeLillo.  Highly recommended.
0385484518|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read about death.  In it's simple but accurate style, the author took me through different stages reflecting how simple things are what really matter when we come to the end.  Beautiful and insightful.
6304383177|5.0|If you are wondering what exactly &quot;screwball comedy&quot; is all about, just see this movie. It highlights the best of the genre: rapid, hilarious dialogue, frantic action, and a crazy plot. Furthermore, it has the perfect example of the essential part of &quot;screwball&quot; - a man and a woman who really love each other, but don't know it, and fight constantly. And, even if you know exactly what screwball comedy is all about, watch this anyhow! Quite simply, this movie is totally hilarious! Every scene is great, even though you could argue that some are a little too long (but I don't mind).<br />The plot is really bizarre, but basically it concerns a palentologist (played by Cary Grant) who lives a dull, boring life and is about to be married to an equally dull and businesslike woman (when he asks to go on a honeymoon, she objects b/c she claims he needs to work instead - &quot;this will be our baby,&quot; she states, gesturing at the dinosour bones). By chance, however, he meets a madcap heiress (played by Katherine Hepburn) who turns his life upside down while taking him to Conneticut to deliver a leopard to her aunt.<br />The performances are all excellent, and Cary and Kate are wonderful together! This is screwball at its best (it is directed by Howard Hawks, the man responsible for some of the other great screwball comedies, like His Girl Friday and Twentieth Century) - and is a must-see for the whole family. Get this movie, and enjoy!
B000002JSV|5.0|Angus and Malcolm Young for years have been declaring Powerage their best album. And they're right. Ironically, it's the only Bon Scott-era AC/DC album that has been totally neglected by Classic Rock Radio, but if anything, that's a good thing. One of the reasons why your average headbanger and Classic Rock Radio DJ skip on Powerage is because it isn't simply about sex, drinking and tongue-in-cheek Satanism; not that these things aren't worth celebrating, but sometimes the discerning music-listener needs a bit more. Powerage has the required AC/DC attributes: raw power, catchy guitar hooks and Bon Scott sass, but it also has the \\"more\\" factor; it has cleverer than average lyrics and dare I say it...substance! Yes. Powerage, the AC/DC album between Let There Be Rock and Highway To Hell with Angus Young being electrocuted on the cover, has substance! One may even label it the thinking headbanger's record. No balls, no Hell, and only one song with \\"rock\\" in the title! Were they mad!? Nope. They were simply growing up. But growing up didn't mean rocking less or getting boring or pretentious. No. It's still straight-up rock & roll (which AC/DC always was more than a heavy-metal act) and Bon Scott is still a witty scallywag.     With Powerage, Bon's lifeblood (sex, booze, rock & roll) is mixed bitterly and savagely with the painful decline of his marriage in a series of songs that string together sodden metaphors and wordplay to create a dark grindhouse movie about a man who dreams feverishly of getting even with his woman. And with their meatiest and most inspired performances ever, the band creates the perfect soundtrack to Bon's jaded journey into the dead of night. The black heart of the album, \\"Sin City\\", is not only the strongest song in the entire AC/DC catalogue, but continues with Bon's wet dream of romanticized wealth and excess. \\"Sin City\\" is to Bon Scott as The Diamond as Big as the Ritz is to F. Scott Fitzgerald. Bon hankers greedily for \\"Lamborginis, caviar,dry martini's, Shangrila\\" and believes he can \\"win in Sin City.\\" This is Bon's big moment; when it's him crashing into the casino like the powerhouse, Mack-truck riff of the song-wired awake for several days and nights, nights, nights! It's hard not to imagine Angus grinning devilishly as he knocks out those  mean-as-a-scarfaced-pimp chords, edging Bon on: yes, you can win, you're the baddest mofo in this town! Angus goes into his wicked as Caligula solo, then we're in the heart of darkness when the music all drops out except for a lone creeping bass and Bon crooning about \\"ladders and snakes\\"; this is that quiet, sexy part of film noir, menacing, foreboding. We know Bon won't win in \\"Sin City\\" and if he does, it will only be for a fleeting moment, before the devil collects his head.    Powerage is indeed about power: The power of money has over the working-class; the power a woman has over a man. It's also about the power of rage and power-struggle-to get that money, to get back at that woman and to make your mark-snarling and biting-in the Power Age. And yes, it's also about electrical power, power-chords and a band at the peak of their powers.

B000000OQF|5.0|Definitely among the best albums ever released . The best songs on this are its so easy , nighttrain , mr. brownstone and Out to get me . Very intense . You can feel Rose's desperation . <BR>Think about you is rather junk and so also is Anything Goes and You're Crazy . but be assured the rest is breathtaking .
B000002UD1|5.0|Being completely obsessed with John Lennon happens to describe me perfectly! Out of all his albums, this definitely is at the top (along with &quot;Double Fantasy&quot;!) I listen to this CD each night before I go to bed, and I'm sure my family is sick of listening to it---but it is a masterpiece. And I'll keep playing &quot;Mind Games&quot; forever....
B000003S0I|4.0|As far as this incarnation of King Crimson goes, this is the best of the 3 studio albums.  It seems to be the definitive crystallization of what Robert Fripp was going for with the 5-piece format.  Ranging from semi-improvisational and atonal (Larks' Tongues Pt. 1) to structured and melodic (Exiles), this album represents a blend between the improvisational/live sound of Starless &amp; Bible Black, and the structure of (most of) Red.  It also seems to flow a little better than either of the other 2 albums.  All in all, the thing that most sets it apart is the melodic ballad style songs Book of Saturday and Exiles.  The angle of these songs was not pursued as much on subsequent albums, but they remain my favorites of this era.  I reccommend The Nightwatch (which almost makes the first 2 albums obsolete, as this Crimson was more of a live band anyway) first, but Larks' Tongues in Aspic is not far behind.
B000002ADT|5.0|From the first time I heard &quot;So What,&quot; I knew I was listening to something special.<br />Since then, I've played this album hundreds, maybe thousands of times.  I never get tired of it.  I always hear something new.  The musicians on this album, some of the greatest that have ever lived, simply made an improvisational masterwork.<br />This album has been reviewed thousands of times by people much more qualified than myself to technically describe the music, so all I can add is that this music truly speaks to one's soul.<br />No CD collection would be complete without this side.
B000067CPX|5.0|Not dissapointed.  Excellent once again.  Rick Rubin has to be the tightest producer ever. This band is in a constant state of growth.  If you don't belive me listen to Mother's Milk next to By the Way.  (but if you're a fan like me you've got them all...)  A great passionate follow up to Californication.  Buy it and keep it.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This album is a must have. <BR>Stick it on an let it take you back in time. <BR>It's aint a CD where you skip every second song in order to find a good one to listen to, there all good tracks. <BR>Type of album that will grow on you, with every song differing in its sound to the next. <BR>Stick this CD on and before you know it you'll be walking around singing tunes off the album which is sure sign that your lurven it. :)
B000001Y2U|5.0|To begin with, I find it necessary to note that Antichrist Superstar is one of the finest collections of metal in the history of music.  Brian Warner and his contrived image aside, this album is the hardest you can get without resorting to the boring and exceedingly tiresome antics from the likes of Slipknot.  Whether you despise Manson as the deplorable man poisoning the minds of America's children, or you adore him as the overly angst-ridden, absurdly dramatic goth rocker of the modern age, songs like Angel with the Scabbed Wings, Kinderfield, Tourniquet, and the Reflecting God say something that all of us can recognize, whether we can relate to it or not. All of his songs are delivered with finesse, and any self-respecting metal fan can't deny the talent and power that is Antichrist Superstar.<BR>  As an ending note, Antichrist is the beginning of a trilogy, a musical novel, if you will.  The first 'book' is Antichrist Superstar, followed by Mechanical Animals, and ending with Holywood.  If you're looking for any other pieces by Manson, I recommend A Portrait of an American Family, and his album to be released in Fall 2oo2 (Golden Age of the Grotesque) seems to be promising...
B00004RF9B|2.0|FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the seminal Science-Fiction movies of<BR>the 1950s, the decade in which ALL the cinematic sci-fi rules<BR>were written regardless of budgets, production or lo-tech<BR>special effects.  It has a plot remotely linked to Shakespeare's<BR>THE TEMPEST but also manages to tie in a great adventure story<BR>wrapped in a cloak of Freudian analysis, the latter benefit<BR>never once getting in the way of the former.  HOWEVER, MGM, now<BR>Warners DVD has managed to put this terrific film out in one <BR>supremely botched transfer.  The colors are muted, washed-out and<BR>tending towards the red scale, while the sound is a boxed-in,<BR>mid-range, semi-monophonic joke.  Instead of the full-range<BR>directional stereo of the original track, we get mono dialogue<BR>and static two-channel presentations of the film's great and<BR>unique electronic score.  If you have any doubts as to these<BR>opinions, simply check out TCM Cable's new transfer and compare. Believe me, after tossing this DVD in the [garbage]<BR>you will have NO doubts as to what can be done to make this<BR>film look fantastic on video.  Save your money for the present and write to Warner video and insist on a remastering.<BR>The only reason this review has two stars is for<BR>the inclusion of the long, original trailer.

B00005JKJA|5.0|A smooth, elegant fabric of a film, the kind you can run softly along your skin and shiver at the sensation.
0156711427|5.0|\\"A Passage to India\\" combines a story of friendship with insightful social commentary which remains vital to this very day. It is the story of Aziz, an Indian, and Fielding, an Englishman, and the friendship between the two men that develops in the wilderness of India. \\"A Passage to India\\" is shot through with issues of power politics, class, gender, religion, and even truth itself; Forester takes on quite a lot in this book and handles it quite well.<br />Perhaps the most striking feature of \\"A Passage to India\\" is how well it has aged through the years since it was first published in 1924. In describing the Indian people, Forester touches on two issues in India which continue to this very day: unity and religion. Considerable time is spent on describing the Indian people and the challenges they faced in unifying such a large and diverse population, challenges which continue to exist to this day. Even more pertinent, Forester describes the mutual animosity between India's Hindus and Muslims, their mistrust toward and misunderstanding of each other, and the resultant difficulties.<br />Of course, at the heart of Forester's book is India and her conquerors, the English. Aziz and Fielding's friendship plays out like a microcosm of this relationship and through it Forester explores the potential for reconciliation between the two civilizations. Several aspects of colonial life, from the degradation of the natives, to the mystery of \\"the Orient\\", to the inexplicable metamorphosis that is worked on Anglo expatriates, is brought to life and analyzed in clear, sometimes poetic language. For his own part, Forester seems intent on Indian independence, yet cautions that the Indians of which he writes may not yet be ready to assert their independence.<br />The dichotomy between the isolated, existentialist Europe which tramples upon the organic, wholeness of India is also examined. Europe is presented as technologically accomplished and all-powerful, yet lacking the love of life that the Indians take for granted. Forester asserts that in Europe it is always work or rest, and that only in the East is the meaning of leisure understood. Forester further presents us with a view of a society which is slowly being transformed from community to isolation: Aziz cautions Fielding that every third servant is an informant, while the natives and expatriates alike are aware of the rigid class system that is slowly solidifying, and the attendant politics and rules that come with it. Although Forester is aware that class issues existed in India long before the arrival of the Europeans, he also understands that something peculiarly Eastern is being destroyed along with the Indian way of life.<br />Forester's book is one which captures the best of both worlds. It brings together a very human story of friendship which will appeal to the emotions and hearts of anyone who has ever built a friendship. Yet it also presents a beautiful portrait of a colonized people and their colonizer, appealing to the intellect of anyone who wonders what it was like back then, or even what it is like now in subjugated nations. If you like fiction at all you should read this book.

B00005OAIE|5.0|I tried out Mayer's cd on a recommendation that described him as Dave-ish. Well, maybe in the sense that his music is lyrical and soulful he is in the same nameless genre as Dave, but the comparison doesn't need to be pushed too far to make Mayer significant. Mayer's &quot;Room for Squares&quot; is pure pleasure--that rare cd where I don't have to skip any of the songs to get to the ones I really like.  But he is not Dave. He is in his early 20s and his music reflects his youth. It is about small personal issues, the stuff of everyday life. Mayer is not extreme in his musical style, but his music is beautiful and soulful and cathartic. Don't miss this one.

0312265859|5.0|I really enjoyed this addition to Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series. I think that after a little difficulty in Seven up Janet bounces back and into a different direction. It is great that we finally learn more about the secret life of Ranger, what he does, where he eats, but not too much to take the fun out of it. It is also nice to see that some of Stephanie's relationship issues are resolving so we see her moving on and growing a little, she really starts to realize where she belongs and where her heart belongs. There is plenty of funny moments and i dont care if she has a car blown up in every novel, it is funny and how it happens is funny so keep them coming, I think it happened three times in this novel. Different people have different opinions and I have read plenty of reviews of people thinking Janet is loosing her touch, but I dont agree I think she is back on track and should keep on going.
B000002KBH|5.0|I dont even know where to begin to explain the beauty of this LP. It is simply amazing. There is no other way to describe it. I stumbled upon \\"american beauty\\" while parusing my dad's CD collection. I picked it up and my dad came over to point out that on the cover, \\"American Beauty\\" can be read two ways (either as american beauty or american reality) and then he said that i was \\"finally old enough\\" to enjoy the grateful dead and that i should go listen to it.  Although it was over 4 years ago, i still remember being struck by the beauty and complexity of the music the first time i heard it. <BR> <BR>This album starts off beautifully with \\"box of rain.\\"  Phil's voice is so beautiful and smooth in this song, and the lyrics are profound to say the least. But of course as in all Dead music, it was the masterful guitar playing that reeled me in. This song holds a special place in my heart because it was the first grateful dead song i ever heard and it was all i needed to hear to become a worshiper of their music. <br />\\"friend of the devil\\" is also amazing. i love trying to keep track of all the different strands of guitar in this song.  i pick out garcia's playing first. then, i can hear lesh playing to perfectly compliment garcia. these guys blow my mind.<br />the lyrics of \\"sugar magnolia\\" are beautiful. and the playing is exquisite. though not the best song on this cd, its definitely amazing.<br />\\"operator\\" gets better and better the more you listen to it.  pigpen does a great job with it.<br />\\"candyman\\" is one of my favorites on the LP.  It is long and mellow, but it carries a serious undertone.  i love the guitar in this one. its another one where i like to follow lesh and garcia as they play.  garcia is such a master with his instrument and lesh plays perfectly to compliment what garcia produces.<br />\\"ripple\\" is one of the dead's most famous songs, and this is duly deserved.  the mandolin playing during the \\"ripple in still water\\" parts adds variety and the lyrics, of course, simpley blow me away. \\"reach out your hand / if your cup be empty / if your cup is full / may it be again\\"<br />\\"ripple\\" slowly changes into \\"brokedown palace\\" which is personally my favorite on the album.  its talk of leaving past sorrows behind fills me with a want to just \\"make myself a bed by the waterside.\\"  this song totally calms me down with the beautiful images it puts in my head. \\"gone to plant a weeping willow / by the bank's green edge it will grow grow grow / sing a lullaby beside the water / lovers come and go / the river roll roll roll\\"  what more can i say? this is a beautiful song. \\"sing me sweet and sleepy all the way back home\\"...\\"fare you well fare you well / i love you more than words can tell / listen to the river sing sweet songs / to rock my soul\\"<br />\\"till the morning comes\\" picks up with a faster tempo after the mellow-ness of \\"brokedown palace\\"  this is an upbeat song. when i listen to this cd i never specifically skip to this track but when it comes on, im more than happy to listen to it.<br />\\"attics of my life\\" slows the listener back down again with beautiful guitar playing and mellow lyrics.  i like to think of this song as a love song (whether it is or not, i dont know). \\"when i had no wings to fly / you flew to me\\"<br />this amazing album ends with \\"truckin\\" once again picking the listener back up with a faster tempo and a fantastic way to end the album.  i love phil's voice in this song and its a great song to watch the band play live. \\"what a long strange trip its been\\" what a beautiful way to end the album.<br />writing this review has made me realize that no words can express the complex beauty of this music. you just have to listen to it to understand. this cd turned me into a belated dead-head. i know it sounds melodramatic but i am tormented knowing that i was born to late.  i strongly recommend this album to anyone. i played this for my friend and she didnt like it. i lost all respect for her. its truly amazing the feelings i get while listening to this album. every one should own a copy.
B000067CPX|3.0|Many bands have been able to progress as they go further into their career.  The Clash did not make their masterpiece London Calling until their 3rd album.  And BSSM was certainly not the 1st album by this group.  But just as the Clash [got worse] towards the end, the Chili Peppers seem to be heading the same way.  Maybe I just really liked the old funky sound and can't appreciate the way this album (and their new sound) is.  There are a couple good tracks.  For people who like the funky sound of the Peppers, track 7 is pretty solid.  And the track titled \\"Cabron\\" is a nice little latin-type number.  All in all, I was not impressed with this album.  Most of the songs sound the exact same and the same formula seems to be repeated over and over again.  If you've never purchased a Chili Peppers album before, go buy BSSM or Freaky Styley.
B00003CXAY|5.0|This set is a [bargain].<br />I saw Koyaanisqatsi at the movies in the eighties and I've never forgotten it.  I later taped it of off Public Television and over the years have played the tape until the oxide was gone.<br />This is one of those movies you will either love or hate.  There's no middle ground.  There is not a spoken word during the entire film and yet you're drawn in by the incredible images and the equally incredible score.  Phillip Glass has never been better.  <br />This picture should be seen and heard large.  The bigger screen the more you'll be drawn into the images.  The better your stereo system, the more you will enjoy the score.<br />I have the sound track to Powaqqatsi and it's excellent.  If the images are half as good as those in Koyaanisqatsi it'll be worth every penny.
B000065U1N|4.0|I remember the fight that the Rangers and the Delta force people had against the Somali warlords in 1993. The images were shocking. Watching the film you get that feeling again and you see how things went wrong. Great acting by Hartnett and the rest of the cast. Sizemore has the role of old timer in the military down to a science. Also people that love action and realism in war films you will get it here. Very graphic war scenes.
B000065U1N|3.0|Although the movie is quite good,<br />But the storyline totally against the true history.<BR>The real story at the end part is \\"Malaysia\\" armies<BR>rescue this silly \\"America\\" armies. Without the help <BR>of Malaysia armies, sure this [people] are killed.

B00000IQC8|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE! CLERKS is a battle cry for anybody like my-<br />self who has ever held a customer service job! The writing is<br />brilliant, the characters are unforgettable and very funny, the<br />music is great; it's just one heck of a movie!!! I avoided watch-<br />ing CLERKS at first just because it was so hyped up and praised<br />by the critics and moviegoers alike, but I soon learned the err-<br />ors of my ways and really got into the movie after viewing it<br />with one of my former housemates! There are so many funny scenes<br />in this! I love that part where that Russian guy sings the song<br />BERSERKER and the scene where that Chewley's rep gets all the<br />customers riled up about smoking, the hockey scene on the roof-<br />top is funny, but my FAVORITE scene has to be when RANDALL tells<br />off that customer in the video scene! The dialogue is perfect and<br />I like how JAY puts an exclamation point at the end of it! There<br />are many funny characters, but I would have to say that my favor-<br />ite is SNOWBALL. He just kind of wanders around in the movie,<br />showing up at various times and the deleted scene with him is<br />hilarious. I really enjoyed the DVD version of this, with all the<br />deleted scenes and the running commentary. It was also interest-<br />ing to see the original final scene. I'ts easy to see why they<br />didn't put it in the film. I also like how during one argument<br />that DANTE is having with VERONICA that the camera shows a shot<br />of the cat reacting! This is a classic film and one of the funn-<br />iest films ever made!

6300185249|5.0|This movie is flat out funny with a very good set-up for the destruction slapstick and witty dialouge.  tom Hanks and Shelly long are a couple who are evicted from their apartment and buy a house that values at 1 milllion dollars but they get it for two-hundred thousand.  They thought they were getting a deal but what they got is a cheap imatation for a house.  Hanks and long try to keep  their relationship in one piece while the house is steadily crumbling into a million.  Anybody who has knowledge of owning a house or knows what it is like to be in love, you should find this movie to be a riot.
B000065U1N|4.0|I thought that this was a great movie when I saw it in the theatre and I could not wait for it to be released on DVD for all the extra features that usually come with a DVD.  After I purchased the DVD I found myself dissapointed with the lack of extra features that I guess I expected.  The back or the DVD case says that the movie trailers are included.  The only trailers I have on my copy are for Spiderman and The One.  I was also hoping for some deleted scenes.  I hope this is not a trend to release a DVD with limited special features and then in six months re-release it as a &quot;Special Edition&quot; with all the extras!
0140277447|3.0|The Rape of Nankingking provides a startling and horrific account of some of the events that took place during WWII in China.  While we all know about Nazi brutality in Germany, very few people are aware of the extent of Japanese brutality in China, including myself.  I had always understood Chinese survivors of WWII vehemently hate the Japanese, but The Rape of Nanking was able to describe (to a limited extent) the hatred and suffering of the Chinese in the hands of the Japanese.<br />However, the analysis left me wondering whether the author did a thorough job of research or whether she was simply not a strong writer.  She glosses over facts and provides very limited analyses of socio-political environment.  While a few of the other reviewers defend her style of writing because she comes from a journalistic background rather than academic, it should still not be an excuse to gloss over facts and provide superficial analyses.<br />As one reviewer states, her analyses rests upon stereotypical notions of Japanese behaviour.  While I do not doubt the brutal treatment of the Japanese soldiers upon the Chinese, I found myself turning page after page, hoping for a more deeper and thorough analysis.<br />Nonetheless, the book is both educational and an eye-opener.  It has certainly brought into the mainstream the brutality and suffering taken place, but the author would serve well to improve her writing and analyses.

B000059HB7|5.0|RIO BRAVO is one of the great westerns of film history with the underlying theme of ordinary men \\"rising to the occasion\\". With direction from the great Howard Hawks, John Wayne (Sheriff, John T. Chance), Dean Martin (Dude), Ricky Nelson (Colorado), and Walter Brennan (Stumpy) are holed up in the town jail to guard a man (Claude Akins) accused of slaying a saloon patron and wait to bring the man to justice. The man happens to be the brother of an evil and powerful land baron. They are stuck guarding the accused while his brother's henchmen try to free him in various ways. The backbone of the story are the four characters with strong distinct personalities and how they handle the pressure of the situation at hand while bonding together. Wayne's character is the professional, no nonsense sheriff, Dino is the drunken deputy trying to sober up and gain respect, Brennan is the old and crippled (but very reliable) deputy, and(with great surprise)is Ricky Nelson's Colorado as the untried,but able young gunhand. Hawks was accused of casting Nelson to attract the teen audiences, but the casting was perfect. Nelson pulls off the role with great professionalism, humor, and a quiet cool! It's too bad he never went on to other solid movie projects as this one. The film is a fun as well as a dramatically entertaining western. Great supporting performance by Angie Dickinson and the great character actor Ward Bond. They don't make them like this anymore. Hawks remade the movie two more times (John Wayne appeared in both remakes), the best being EL DORADO with Robert Mitchum and James Caan (as Mississipi).
B000002O1P|5.0|Southern Accents finds Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers at their creative peak. Using life in the South as his template Petty creates music that transports the listener into a world of emotions laid bare and love, anger, and frustration hold equal sway. Thoughtful and moving lyrics are found on a number of cuts, particularly the title cut, \\"The Best of Everything,\\" and \\"Rebels.\\" Balancing out these tunes are darker songs like the Randy Newmanesque \\"Spike\\" a tale that will fuel all those paranoid fantasies about little Southern bars, and the pure venom in \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\" as dark a hit single as you will find. This is a must for any rock collection.
0440211727|4.0|Grisham's first book.  Certaintly a must for a loyal fan.  Since there are plenty of reviews saying the plot, I'll skip that and go to my opinion.<br />To start off, I would give this book 3 1/2 stars, but for a first attempt it deserves that little boost.<br />One would note that most great author's first attempts are complete failures, however \\"A Time To Kill\\" is a pleasent difference from the norm.<br />\\"A Time To Kill\\" is a great book with its ups and downs.  Grisham described the emotion and turmoil perfectly, like an artist putting the suttle intricacies on his finest work.  I really like the fact that Grisham ventures toward a plot that most writers are afraid to grab because of the politics involved.  Its a nice story that is emotionally compelling and reviels the truth about modern issues such as racism, violence, and vigilante justice.   <br />Now for the bad. Some of the characters are really unnecisary and their place in the story could have been improved or cut out intiarely.  Grisham could have extended the trial. He seemed to have rushed the trial, even though it is the climax of the story...The huge climatic surprise that makes a Grisham novel a true Grisham novel was just non-existent. <br />Don't get me wrong, this is definently one of those that really deserves its place on that special shelf. Give it a read, this wonderful first attempt deserves it.
B00004Y6NV|2.0|With songs like the insipid \\"Ticket to Heaven\\" and the lounge sound of \\"My Parties,\\" (a song that tries to have the sarcastic flair of a Randy Newman but fails miserably) On Every Street gives the listener Dire Straits at its weakest.  Knopfler's guitar sounds buried under the mix, and he affects a bass voice that just doesn't register. Even songs that could have proven to be winners like \\"Calling Elvis,\\" the title track and  \\"Heavy Fuel\\" seem to have been recorded while the band was in a state of depression. This is one of the band's worst recordings and along with Love Over Gold the one most easily skipped by the casual fan.

B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavignes new cd titled &quot;Let Go&quot; is an immediate hit. It's not the kind of CD where you want to skip through songs because they're &quot;not cool&quot; or they &quot;sound boring&quot;! When I first listened to the CD, I listened to it from start to finish. All of Avril's songs are great! She writes all her music, and she is great at it! The songs come from her heart, from experiences shes had. They all show emotion. The songs are catchy and they are so fun to sing. I love Avril Lavigne, she is going to be big.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This CD contains a wonderful selections of songs that are a joy to listen to, especially if you want to kick back and relax a while.

0156711427|5.0|I read this book when I was thirteen and fell in love with it. It is my favorite classic that I have read yet. It is a story of racial tensions in the steaming, exotic land of Chandrapore, India, where the British have a Cantonment with clubs, and the natives have villages with muddy roads and mosquitoes, and are expected to submit to the will of their dominators. Yet in the early 1900's, at the time Gandhi was still in South Africa, after two centuries of British rule, the native people, Hindus and Muslims alike, are growing tired.<br />When Adela, a young woman engaged to a British magistrate, and Mrs. Moore, the magistrate's mother, come to India to plan for the wedding, they are hopelessly enthralled and terribly naive. When Dr. Aziz, a young Muslim physician, meets Mrs. Moore in a mosque, he is charmed by her reverence in that she took off her shoes upon entrance. From here, a great friendship is formed. Adela, too, desires to befriend the natives, yet her efforts are regarded with contempt by both British and Indians, as both sides know and agree that it is impossible to be friends with both natives and Europeans. Only one has suceeded in that account, and his name is professor Fielding, known as Cyril by his students. A single, eccentric college professor, Fielding teaches Hindu and Muslim university students, while still mingling with British socialites. When he meets Adela, he too, scorns her aspirations. Thus, he also warns his Muslim friend, Dr. Aziz, not to bring her to the Marabar Caves.<br />It was supposed to be a very simple excursion to one of the most beautiful sites in local India. Aziz had not really meant it about taking Adela and Mrs. Moore there--had thrown it out as a casual suggestion--but being British, Adela and Mrs. Moore take him at his word. The trip turns to disaster, though, when a mysterious figure tries to rape Adela in one of the caves. Since no one has seen the attacker and no one can account for Aziz's whereabouts, he is soon blamed. In a climax that is chilling yet realistic, A Passage To India shows us what the best and worst of human nature and human prejudice can lead us to.
B000067CPX|5.0|The new peppers is amazing! It has 16 tracks of syrupy sweet melodic outbursts coupled with two rockin tracks for good measure.  Although this album is undoubtedly the Peppers most mellow this does not detract from the overall experience.  The album jumps from signature funky numbers like \\"Can't Stop\\" and the title track, to the latin tinged acoustics of \\"Cabron\\", to the atmospheric textures of \\"Warm Tape, and finally to the suit-like \\"Venice Queen\\".  This is an amazingly captivating disc that is strong from start to finish.  This is one of the best albums of the year and in my opinion a Chili Pepper Essential. <br />p.s. To all those that will claim the album is to mellow. Cut the band a break another album filled with funk punk anthems would be about as fresh as 1989.,
6305003882|5.0|You know it's funny, it takes a movie like this to demonstrate what we already know.  I'm gonna cut the legs on this review short.  From experience, I can vouch for the movies message that the emotion is real.  This has no correlation with the actors, nor' the directing, simply on the story, which in fact is derived from a true one.       I'm a fan on the depiction of the human condition; and after watching this movie, I had to catch my breath.  The Human suffering, the tragedy, it all comes full circle here, and you just want to reach out your hand, but then again it's just a movie.  This movie grips you, and entangles you in a web of emotions, showing you the inner-workings, as though the human condition was an organ.  I like the thought of that, indeed.  So you have my opinion, that this movie is for any fan who likes to be knee deep in a gripping tale.  But don't worry, you can't overdose on this, like I said, it's just a movie.
B000067CPX|5.0|I remember my first Chili Peppers show back during the Mother's Milk tour as I was about to enter high school. I remember thinking how fun and crazy the show was - anthony completing going nuts on stage, flea slappin', john mesmerizing me w/ his guitar, chad pounding the skins... as a foolish, obnoxious, rebellious teen, I was hooked.<br />It's been over 12 years since that show and it amazes me that they continue to pound out excellent music and it amazes me more that they one of the few bands I still listen to and have even grown to like more. These guys have matured through their experiences - both good and bad, have grown tighter as a group/family, which I attribute to their chemistry in making such great tunes. This album in particular is a testament that true innovation can only arise from maturity and experience. John has been one of my favorite guitarists and this album displays his creativity and style. If you're a long time fan, this album will definitely make you appreciate them more. It's unique, sincere, intelligent, and still a whole lot of fun.
B000066JES|5.0|Right off the bat I want to say that I love this record. It it perhaps the best thing Manowar has ever put out and that is saying a lot after 20 years. I've loved them since 1982's \\"Battle Hymns\\", and the talent is just so evident. True, there is an Elvis cover of the \\"American Trilogy\\" and yes, there is a portion of a Puccini opera, \\"Nessun Dorma\\", but you know what? Those songs are GREAT! Eric Adams has one of the finest voices on this planet, and the heartfelt patriotic feelings shown in \\"American Trilogy\\" and the fantastic \\"Fight For Freedom\\" ring true. They were touched by the events surrounding 9/11 and wrote what they felt about it. Good for them! This band is so versatile that they simply throw a lot of people off guard. Songs like \\"Call To Arms\\" and the title track and not to forget \\"Hand of Doom\\", \\"House of Death\\" and \\"Fight Until we Die\\" are vintage Manowar epics. No matter what anyone says, from this 20 year fan of Manowar, this is a terrific album, showcasing the great Manowar at their absolute finest....
B000067CPX|3.0|I haven't been much of a fan of this Band because I always say they have Jacked Fishbone's Career among others.standard Production here that they usually do¬ much difference with there Vocal Performance.I heard this Set on MTV 2 on there Play-back show.Instrumentation is along the lines of most of there stuff during the past Decade.\\"Tear\\" was a Interesting cut.they have one or two songs on there Albums that usually get your attention but I haven't heard a whole Album by them that has fully gotten me.
B00005JKJA|4.0|I'm optimistic that someday it'll all make just some sense to me.  No doubt, this movie will redefine the genre of weird movies.<br />I'll admit that I had high expectations to begin with, so I might have been taken aback, although that seems to be the general feel of the movie.  I was mesmerized, startled, ambivalent, confused, all in the first ten minutes.  I expected to see something unique, dream-like, maybe even subtly profound, but the first thirty minutes or so seemed like a parody...characters who like shockingly like actors, cartoonish car crash, goofy detectives, spooky homeless monster man behind the fast-food restaurant.  On the one hand, I can see that maybe its meant to make the impression that in LA, everything looks like a TV show, and is a parody of Hollywood.  On the other hand, I still feel that, any way you put it, that Lynch is eccentric, genius, unique, subtle, transcendental - he's still laughing at you - ...  He's not only ridiculing Hollywood filmmakers, he's also surreptitiously mocking it's film viewers.<br />That said, the film is amazing.  It's funny (the scene with Adam and the Cowboy has to be a top comedy moment in film history), and yet you'll be surprised that there is drama (albeit, far far removed when you're still struggling to comprehend), and mysterious.  After a while, after immersing myself in the aura for a while, the acting became really quite wonderful, and the setting increasingly mystical.  There are really several stages that you have to go through to finally 'realize' this movie.<br />I can't say that this is one of my favorites yet.  I'll still have to study it, and even so, it's incomparable to any other type of movie that I've seen, I don't know where or how to place it.  It is an unsettling and haunting film.
B000002H97|5.0|This album, along with ...And Justice For All, is Metallica at their best. It still has some of the edge of their earlier work (which is a good thing) but it is a more refined and mature album. I'm not a big fan of the speed/thrash metal of some of the earlier albums so I like the fact that this CD retains the heaviness of earlier releases without the speed (for the most part). And while later Metallica works have lost some of the edge (though the sellout argument is not a theory I buy into), this disc is the \\"middle ground\\" disc where Metallica does everything right. That may upset a few old-time Metallica fans, but I like what I like. <br />Some of my favorite songs here include the grinding \\"Wherever I May Roam\\", the heavy riffing of \\"Of Wolf and Man\\" and the powerful \\"The Unforgiven\\". The opening bass solo on \\"My Friend of Misery\\" (my favorite song here) is cool as is the rest of this angry song. \\"The God That Failed\\" is another standout in the same vein as \\"My Friend of Misery\\".  And though Metallica has taken a ton of grief over \\"Nothing Else Matters\\", it is still a good, introspective song--cries of sellout don't measure up to good songwriting, friends. <br />This is a damn, good album with only the occasional song that leaves me wanting (\\"Holier Than Thou\\", \\"Through the Never\\"). And while I do like Load (I can hear the angry gasps), the sound and style Metallica achieved on this album (and ...And Justice For All) is the sound and style I prefer most. The strong songwriting coupled with the attitude here can't be beat.
B000067CPX|5.0|In a time when music on the air waves altogether sounds similar, you can count on The Red Hot Chili Peppers for a breathe of fresh air. Ever evolving but with the same liveliness as always. Lyrics and musicianship are astonishing. Wiser, older, but greater than ever the Red Hot's have come through for ROCK.
0792157869|4.0|\\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" disappoints, for its inability to construct a believable action scene.  Who'd get taken in by this blatant cartoonery?  I, frankly, miss the stark realism and gritty humanism of \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" and \\"The Temple of Doom\\".  What?  They were live-action cartoons too?  Well, that changes everything, then, doesn't it?<br />Kidding aside, you shouldn't ever go into an Indiana Jones movie expecting credible action.  And \\"The Last Crusade\\" has the least credible, but at times most fun, action of any in the series.  Watch as Indy, armed only with a horse and the strap from his bag, manages to outrun and outgun a German tank.  Later in the sequence, we get a moment that for me defines the ethos Spielberg and Lucas have built for this series.  Indiana is wrestling with some Nazis on the tank.  The tank moves slowly towards a cliff.  Instead of jumping off the tank at the last minute, leaving the baddies to tumble to their doom, Indy appears to go over the cliff with them.  His entourage, which includes his stoic father, rushes to the side of the cliff just in time to see the tank hit bottom and explode.  Somber faces all around.  Just as they say their goodbyes, the camera cuts to a hand appearing by the cliff's edge, out of their view.  It's Indy!  He's alive!  After a quick moment to brush himself off, he joins his friends to see what the fuss is about.  His father does a pitch-perfect double-take upon noticing him, then explodes in joyous tears.  The scene ends with Indy, collapsed in exhaustion, surprised when his fedora, thought lost in the wreckage, tumbles into his lap.  It's a perfect blend of classic Saturday matinee hokiness with a dollop of contemporary self-awareness.  The filmmakers know that Indy's invincible.  The actors know it.  And most importantly, the audience knows it.  But for a brief moment, the film has us going.  Then it allows us to laugh at our own gullibility.<br />Besides mocking the genre pictures fromwhence it came, \\"The Last Crusade\\" spends a lot of time winking and nudging about its own past.  The character, by this point in the trilogy, has a lot of history, and much of it is playfully referenced here.  One key moment finds Indy and his current Jones girl, Elsa, exploring the catacombs underneath a Venetian library.  Intricate hieroglyphics adorn the walls.  One in particular looks like a glowing golden box.  Elsa points it out and asks, \\"What's this one?\\"  \\"The Ark of the Covenant,\\" says Indy.  \\"Are you sure?\\" she confirms, perfectly setting up his deadpan reply: \\"Pretty sure.\\"  More explicitly is the infamous opening sequence, starring River Phoenix as Young Indiana.  In it we see, during one quick trip across a Circus train, the origins of Indy's fedora, his whip, his fear of snakes, and his knack for adventure.  Even though I have some trouble believing that the fragile and feline Phoenix will grow up to be the rugged and rough Harrison Ford, he has enough fun during the sequence to make my qualms disappear.<br />Which leads me to the casting of Indy's father.  It might seem far-fetched to have the decidedly Midwestern Ford fathered by Sean Connery.  But like Phoenix, Connery has enough fun here to make you forget the differences in their accents.  You'll be won over by the twinkle in his eye and the bounce in his step.  The movie relies heavily on their chemistry, and at this task it does not fail.  Connery, who provided the model for Indiana Jones in the first place (what is Indiana Jones if not an archaeological James Bond?), plays against type: he's a bookworm.  Armed with his tweed jacket and neat bow-tie, he's hardly the Jones patriarch you were expecting.  Henry Jones is a Mr. Magoo-type character, accidentally finding ways of saving the day, when his more daring son can't.  In \\"The Last Crusade\\", Connery proves, through the power of his towering charisma and impeccable comedic timing, why he's still a star, some forty years after \\"Dr. No\\".<br />Not so successful a casting choice is Alison Doody.  Her Elsa continues the tradition of Indy's leading women getting better and better looking, while being played by poorer and poorer actresses.  From Karen Allen, to Kate Capshaw, to a new high/low.  If this trend continues, I expect to see Denise Richards in \\"Indy IV\\".  True, you understand why the shallowness in Indy's character would find her appealing, but Doody brings little more than wooden line readings to the movie.<br />While not as 'important' a movie as others in his oeuvre, \\"The Last Crusade\\" once again shows how adept Steven Spielberg is at manipulating an audience into high gear.  The action sequences are economical and exciting, the visual jokes work like a charm every time, and the special effects, while already dated, work in a cheesy/kitschy kind of way.  On top of all this, Spielberg throws in more Nazi imagery here than in any of his other movies, including \\"Schindler's List\\".  When Indy finds himself face-to-face with Hitler, in one of the film's best jokes, Spielberg doesn't miss the opportunity for some fun at the fuhrer's expense.<br />The ending, much-maligned, does well servicing the story.  We've been leading up to finding the Holy Grail, but it's not really an important part of the story, just an excuse for mild adventures.  After all, the filmmakers didn't even bother to come up with a menacing villain to stand in the Jones' way.  What we do get is a hubristic stooge, whose obsessiveness is burning so intensely, it's obvious to everyone but him that it will be his downfall.  The ending provides some suspenseful moments, gives all the characters credible reasons for doing what they have to do to move the story along, and ties up all the loose ends.  It's a fine way to wrap up another fun entry in the Indiana Jones series.
B000067CPX|5.0|It's been 3 years, 1 month and 1 day since the peppers released their biggest seling album, Californication and finally after a year of messing around in the studio, album delays, emotional breakdowns, vacations, various personal demons, health problems, fake internet rumors, rumored troubles with the band's founding members...BY THE WAY IS HERE AND THE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS ARE BACK! By now most people have heard the first single, By The Way and at this very moment the radio is playing it non-stop and it's climbing up the singles charts and topping a few of them as well. The video still hasn't made it into heavy rotation on mtv or vh-1 but neither play videos anymore anyways. <br />After hearing the first single many people are getting into the Peppers once again but i'm sure there will be alot of very confused people out there when they finally buy the album...and alot of letdown people as well. By the Way is the Peppers version of Pet Sounds or Revolver and is so different from anything they've released before but to call them a sell-out would be wrong and would easily point out that you don't know the band at all. The sounds and different musical genres found on this album are what the Peppers grew up with and have been into for years and anyone who thinks they are just into rap, funk, punk and rock are missled and missinformed. <br />Californication was either loved or bashed by long time fans. Alot of people were mad that the funk was hardly there but if you want a band that is repetitive and keeps making the same stuff over and over the Peppers aren't you're band. It's been 11 years since the band released their last all-funk album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik and they have gone through alot since then and on the last 2 albums (One Hot Minute and Californication)and this one they have made the songs alot more personal and emotional. With this one alot of the Peppers faithful knew what they were getting and we knew from Anthony that the funk was on a holiday and that By the Way would be the most personal and emotional Peppers album to date...and it is. <br />The Peppers have never been a band to follow a certain trend and became legends by doing what they wanted on their own terms and for the past 19 1/2 years have followed their hearts. Alot of people may be turned off by the slower songs on this album and that I think should somewhat be expected but to anyone who puts this album down because it's not what you wanted or it doesn't sound like Blood Sugar or the EMI albums from the 80's...stop listening to what MTV and radio tells you too and open your mind and ears. This band will never sell-out because unlike almost every other mainstream band they haven't let fame go to their heads and they listen to their hearts and souls. They love what they do, they love each other and they love the fans that support them. Anthony has spilled his heart and soul out on this album and for the first time...the funk isn't needed and wouldn't fit on By The Way and the album is better without alot of rocking funky tunes. <br />I've been a devoted and diehard Red Hot Chili Peppers fan for over 11 years now. I've spent hours and hours posting on message boards and websites about the band I love so much and they continue to give me and all their fans throughout the world top notch music that doesn't cut corners, that isn't overproduced or forced out, that isn't watered down, that isn't out to make millions. The Peppers have given this world so much in their 19+ years together and once again with By The Way they have outdone their previous works and remained the top band in the world and still with 3 members nearing the age of 40 later this years (Anthony, Flea, and Chad) and John in his mid-30's they have shown no signs of letting anyone down or giving it all up because they are a family and they love everything about what they do and i'd challenge anyone out there to tell me a band that is the same way as the Red Hot Chili Peppers!<br />Another beautiful landmark album by the most original band out there that is worth every penny you spend on it!
B000068QY7|4.0|I really don't appreciate Beth Massa's review of this album as seen above. She makes Oasis sound criminal for &quot;ripping off&quot; The Beatles. I think this album is class! I was worried about Oasis for a while but this put all my qualms aside. Do yourself a favor and buy this album.
0767906543|5.0|There are several questions about men that women have been struggling to answer for some time. Why must they always hold on to the remote control? Why can they only talk during commercials, even when they are watching reruns? Why do they hate shopping with us? What exactly do they do in those electronics stores for hours? Why wont they commit? Mike Gayle gives a little insight in his book, Mr. Commitment. This is the story of Ben Duffy, and young comedian struggling to come to grips with his commitment phobia. His girlfriend, Mel, is ready for marriage, but is he?<br />This book was a big surprise to me. I really didnt expect to enjoy it as much as I did. I tend to usually read only female authors. I identify with them more, but this book was just what I needed. It was great to get the male perspective on relationships. Men and women will never fully understand each other, but it's nice to know that we all have the same doubts and worries. I will definitly be looking for more from Mike Gayle.
0312265859|3.0|The Hard Eight is a very good and detailed story, but i did not enjoy the book. It is very funny starting from the first paragraph to the end of the book. Of course it does not matter how good the story is if does not read well. i thought the book was poorly written and showed no emotion. Plus, it did not follow, but jumped from one thing to the next. i had to force myself to pick up the book and actually try to read it.
B000067CPX|5.0|Boy, I've been really looking forward to this album for months, so I was so happy when I could finally buy this today. The first track &quot;By The Way&quot; is a great way to start the album with the  slapping bass of flea and the passionate lyrics of Anthony Keidis with a mix of singing and rap like a lot of past chili peppers songs.  The rest of the album, though is more passionate and toned down a bit since Californication, with practically Anthony only singing, and not rapping. In conclusion, if you only like the rap/funk songs be wary of buying this, if not get this album, because it's a masterpiece in which there isn't a bad song on the album, resulting in a potential album of the year.
B00005R2M3|2.0|I was a huge Shakira's fun, i liked her first cd \\"Pies descalzos\\" even though it was more simple, and \\"Dnde estn los ladrones?\\" was cool too, the mtv umplugged had really weird singles like \\"Donde estas corazon?\\" it just freaked me out.<BR>But this album is just so annoying for me!, i hope the best to Shakira, but now she is so different!, she belongs to an industry, and every single is so commercial, and her image, now she is blond, more american maybe...
B00004R99F|5.0|A Goofy Movie is cool!

He's not exactly the biggest man on campus.<BR>On the last day of school, Max decides this calls for desperate measures.

It's one of the lesser-known classics.<BR>I give it two thumbs up.
0446608955|5.0|I just finished this book and i thought it was great. So beleivable, so  fluid. They author plants right in the scenes as though this were a Drive-In Theatre. It is easy to follow even for those not as old as the main characters is supposed to be.<br />The book is often funny too. The comments about his strategy for becoming student body president was hilarious.<br />My one fault in the book is the excessive use of the phrase&quot; If you know what I mean.&quot;  I am not sure if it was used to bring the reader back to the present time or to make sure the reader is fixed in the past, I just think it was used too much, there for a predictable distraction.

0792833279|5.0|What could be better than this snappy comedy, based on an Elmore Leonard book and with a cast including John Travolta, Gene Hackman, Rene Russo, Danny DeVito, Delroy Lindo, and James Gandolfini?  Answer: not much.  This is guiltless fun for a Friday night when you want to just hang out with friends and laugh out loud.  A classic of the '90s.
B000002UJQ|5.0|These soundscapes and lavished vocals are rarely ever found on a rock album of the 90s, apart from Tool's Aenima and R.E.M's Monster.  Sassy and contagious, Thom Yorke vocally rips through each track with cleverness and curiosity(huh whats that?  When I am king you will be first against the wall With your opinions which are of no consequence at all), and it almost always leaves the listener with a buzz.  The guitar work from Jonny and Colin Greenwood on tracks like Airbag, Paranoid Android and Climbing Up Walls is incendiary, jumping to another plain of existence where fantasy meets reality.  Somber tracks like Karma Police and Exit Music(for a film)calm AND disturb, with light acoustic guitar melodies and piano.  Where light melodies collide with rough edged vocals, guitar riffs, and drums, OK computer is one experience you will never forget.  Very emotional, very intense, very curious.  Please explore.
B000067CPX|4.0|This new R.H.C.P. cd has a compleetly different sound from any of their other ones, but it is still pretty good.  The songs feature a lot of strings and harmonies, and the fastest track on the cd is the single, By The Way.<br />The Chili Peppers seem to be doing a R.E.M. thing by changing their styles (not selling out!) on each cd, and this style is unquestionably VERY different.<BR>The cd keeps a weird, happy-but-deppressed tone throughout, but it is still a masterpeice.<br />The cd is not one of their best, but not their worst.
B000066NW0|5.0|I first bought this CD after seeing her video &quot;Complicated&quot; on MTV, which I thought was better then any Sum 41 video, and after my cousin recommended it to me.  It was great!!  All the songs are written by her, which I think is cool, unlike Britney Spears and all those pop singers who have people write songs for them.  All the songs are great, especially &quot;Sk8er Boi.&quot;  I totally recommend this album for anybody looking for a good CD.  It's totally worth it!
B000067CPX|5.0|The Chilis are back with their long-awaited follow-up to Californication.  To sum up, this album is an extension and elaboration of the more wistful tunes on its predecessor.  You won't find the infectious driving beat of \\"By the Way\\" on the rest of the album, but the harmonies, sweet melodies Keidis' perfect lyrical cadence can be found on every song.<br />Unlike other bands who roll out their same old, tired formulaic ... RHCP is always delving deeper into their artistic growth from the previous album and sharing the little beautiful things in life with eccentric lyrics and inventive wordplay.  So far, my favorite tracks are:<br />#5. Don't Forget Me<BR>#6. The Zephyr Song<BR>#7. Can't Stop<BR>#11. Cabron <br />I can still listen to Californication over and over, so I'm sure By the Way will hold me over for the next couple of years until I start craving more of the band's stuff.  Although this album is already sinking its hooks into me, I can't help but wish that there was more of Flea's trademark churning basslines.  Maybe next time?
B000067CPX|5.0|By far the most dynamic album that RHCP to date.  By the Way shows how much this band has grown over the last few years and is a great representation of the wide and varied influences on this band.  This album covers ska, funk, rock, alternative, and 80's modern moods so it's got something for everyone.  The tracks are layered nicely too so that each listen is guaranteed to spark some new interest in a subtle nuance that you didn't notice before.  This is the album you will be rocking out to for the next two years and you will look back on ten years from now and say DAMN they just don't make music like that anymore.

B00003CX95|5.0|Great movie.  A little long and drawn out, but well done.  Not something that I am going to watch 20 times, but one of those good must see movies.  Big battle scenes.  We played a drinking game once where whenever someone died, you had to drink.  The game was short lived as like 500 people get killed in the many battles in the movie.
B000065U1N|5.0|For those of you who thought Black Hawk Down was too overdone, think about it for a second. It's about war; it HAS to have the killing and edginess to it. But for those of you who don't like violence, this may not be the movie for you. I thought the movie was wonderfully done. I read some other reviews and they said that there were too many characters that you don't get personally attached, but I disagree. Unless you have bad vision or aren't reasonably smart, you should be able to keep all the characters straight--even if you don't know all their names, you recognize their faces. It is not the typical war movie where soldiers come running up against the other side, but shows the more recent complications soldiers encounter: fighting inside cities. Yes, a lot of soldiers die, but not all the \\"non-essential\\" soldiers get killed off. A wonderful movie!

0385503954|4.0|This was a tough book for me to read.  I tend towards easy reads, romance and fluff but immediately purchased this book based on NY Times review.  I'd put it down and have to pick it back up.  The intense descriptions were overwhelming at times.  I can appreciate the author's way of bringing the story to life for us.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Spider-Man was a classic movie and if you haven't seen it yet I suggest you do.  I admit the storyline wasn't excellent and it was a little predictable but that isn't bad enough to take away a star.  The special effects were amazing and it lived up to it's expectations.  The best movie I've seen this year.<br />It's about a high school boy, who is kind of geeky and loves spiders.  One day his school goes on a field trip to a spider museum.  He gets bitten by a new species and goes home to have a sleep because he is not feeling so good.  When he wakes up he doesn't need his glasses to see, and he has all of these weird super-powers.  He turns into the ultimate superhero... Spiderman!<br />It is a classic movie, a must see.  Everybody will enjoy this movie, and it is a movie for both kids and adults.  I'm not sure if they've done this in America or other parts of the world but in the UK they have lowered the rating from a 12 to a PG, so anyone can see it.
B000066F6H|5.0|&quot;Hate to Say That I Told You So&quot; was already my summer single of the year, so I was a fan before I bought this CD.  Basically it's a thinly sliced slab of attitude and energy, with a good bunch of songs that are at times produced with modern flourishes (occasional synths, filter sweeps) but mostly served straight up.  The revelation here is Pelle Almqvist's sneering vocals.  I've been a punk rock fan since the original Nuggets era, and I have to say the Almqvist is in my opinion the best punk rock vocalist since Raw Power-era Iggy (to whom he owes a substantial stylistic debt).  In fact, it hadn't even dawned on me until I heard this CD that the punk-New Wave era of the late '70s generated a lot of good bands and good music, but few people that could begin to approach the technical vocal process of the punk godfather himself.  Pelle does it in spades--a nasal sneer that soars, screeches, squeaks, and scrapes in all the right places, missing the marks just enough to keep it real emotionally.  The guitars and drums are just terrific, and the songs too, but the only area in which the band comes up short is its lyrics.  Almqvist's words are drenched in attitude and the punk rock tradition, but ultimately he has less to say about anything than, say, Iggy, or Johhny Rotten, or Pete Shelley.  This band's world view is more grounded in the '60s punk era (e.g. the Seeds or Standells) than in punk's more &quot;relevant&quot; recent incarnations.  But nonetheless, &quot;just for fun&quot; is great if it's REAL FUN, and this CD certainly is that.  Highly recommended.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Snoop Doggy Dogg was and always will be the Greatest rapper of all time, but when he created the immortal doggystyle which is still the BEST rap album of time, he instantly claimed the crown as the hip hop king. Noone had the flow that he had at the time and noone ever will. This album is bangin all the way through, there is no need to skip any of the songs or skits. The signature songs on this album are what's my name, gin and juice, murder was the case, ain't no fun, g'z and hustlaz. But those are only the complete CLASSICS. The rest of the songs are just dope as hell. So if u dont' have this classic album go pick it up ASAP. You will not be disappointed. SNOOP DOGGY DOGG TRUELY IS THE ILLEST.
B000067CPX|2.0|Finally, the album all of us RHCP fans have been waiting for! But don't get too over excited just yet, for this album may not come to your liking as much as Californication and Blood Sugar Sex Magik. After impatiently counting down the days of this album's release date and reaching the day of liberation, I quickly rushed to my local music CDs shop to be one of the first to pick up a copy of the album. The best tracks on this album are without a doubt track #1 (By The Way), track #3 (This Is The Place), track #11 (Cabron) and track #13 (On Mercury). The rest of the tracks do not impress me, which is very unusual for such a great band. I sure hope the Chili Peppers get their act together and create another great album like they are capable of doing.<br />1. By The Way - First single, my favorite song on the album. ( Rating: 5/5 )<BR>2. Universally Speaking - Not a bad attempt here, but still needs work. ( Rating: 3/5 )<BR>3. This Is The Place - Slow and mellow track, good song. ( Rating: 4.1/5 )<BR>4. Dosed - Slow track, this one sounds like a country song. ( Rating: 3/5 )<BR>5. Don't Forget Me - Slow and weak song. ( Rating: 2/5 )<BR>6. The Zephyr Song - Good and mellow track. Worth listening to. ( Rating: 3.5/5 )<BR>7. Can't Stop - Faster movement on this one. Not a bad song either. ( Rating: 3.5/5 )<BR>8. I Could Die For You - A song to listen when you want to sleep. ( Rating: 2.9/5 )<BR>9. Midnight - Worst song on the album. ( Rating: 1.5/5 )<BR>10. Throw Away Your Television - Nice beats, could have been better. ( Rating: 3/5)<BR>11. Cabron - Latin-flavored song. Second favorite! ( Rating: 5/5)<BR>12. Tear - Mediocre track here, nothing special. ( Rating: 2.9/5 )<BR>13. On Mercury - Good beats. This song makes me want to dance. ( Rating: 4/5 )<BR>14. Minor Thing - Doesn't interest me. ( Rating: 2.8/5 )<BR>15. Warm Tape - Doesn't interest me too. ( Rating: 2.8/5 )<BR>16. Venice Queen - Moody song. ( Rating: 3/5 )<br />Total: 52 / 80<BR>Grade: D
B00005A46T|5.0|Being a huge fan of Slipknot, I have to say that their second album IOWA is one of the most hard hitting, agressive, and most insane album I have ever heard or bought.  Their first album proved that they can be aggressive, and my thought was proven a 10% more when I bought this album.  All the songs are exellant espcially People=S**t, Disasterpiece, The Heretic Anthem, Left Behind, My Plague, Everything Ends, New Abortion, and Metabolic.  Corey Taylor has more of a psycho side waiting to get out on this album than the first cd.  If you like hard sounding, fast, and mostly insane band ever to hit the stage or hit the record store.  Slipknot would be the one I would reccomend
B00005JKNF|1.0|This is normally the kind of film that I really enjoy. I read all the positive reviews from the critics, and so when it came out on DVD, I rushed out to buy it. I really wanted to like this film, but I can't even believe that the reviewers who gave this film a postive review and I even saw the same film.<br />First, and most damaging, was the sound mix on this film. The dialogue was so unintelligable and muddled that I had to turn on the closed captioning just to understand the dialogue. There was so much background noise interfering with the dialogue, and so much dialogue that overlapped with other dialogue, I couldn't understand a word that was being said. At the beginning, I kept turning up the volume on the tv because I thought it was my sense of hearing. It wasn't until the tv volume was almost all the way up that I realized that it was the film, not my hearing. By that time, I'd missed a huge portion of the dialogue that set up various critical character interactions and plot points, and I didn't even care enough to go back and re-view it to see what I'd missed. It was horrible!<br />Secondly, the characters were so flat and indistinguishable that I still don't know who was who, or even the character's names! If I spend 2 hours with a set of movie characters, I'd at least like to know who they are by the end of the film, and why they're doing what they're doing. Still have no clue who most of the characters were, or why I should care about them.<br />Some of the actors were fabulous, but expecting Maggie Smith, Jeremy Northam, and Emily Watson to carry a film of this length and complication by themselves is ludicrous. Ryan Phillipe's acting was horrible and Derek Jacobi was utterly wasted. I plan to sell this DVD as soon as I can, and clear some room in my DVD rack for a better film.

B00001ZULV|5.0|As a single-disc collection goes, this one can't get much better. One can argue that the failed &quot;Congo&quot; should've been left off (and possibly even &quot;In Your Wardrobe&quot;) in favor of still more heavily-played tracks from the Phil Collins era, but as it stands this is an adequate career retrospective. I personally would love to see a second compilation, which would have to include: &quot;Illegal Alien&quot;, &quot;Home By The Sea&quot;, &quot;Taking It All Too Hard&quot;, &quot;No Reply At All&quot;, &quot;Man On The Corner&quot;, &quot;Paperlate&quot;, &quot;Just A Job To Do&quot;, &quot;Duchess&quot;, &quot;Keep It Dark&quot;, &quot;Never A Time&quot; and &quot;Driving The Last Spike&quot;.
B00004SZWD|4.0|While \\"Songs....\\" is certainly an ambitious album, even by today's standards, and after being a diehard Stevie fan for my entire life, listening intently to his work and studying this particular LP with my ears for years, I still think there's something missing. I don't know if he just spent too much time 'perfecting' his approach or trying on too many hats, but much of this sounds forced. While I love artists who overreach and bravely wander into new territory, such bravery and experimentation can't be half-hearted but must be approached with vigor and fearlessness. The songs here are good, but not good enough to warrant their length or bloated production, half-baked song ideas simply can't be covered by strings or by running really long. Lyrically, things are equally shaky and almost an embarrassment (..\\"until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4???\\") and could have used a lot more focus. Stevie the ARTISTE' just got a bit out of hand here. \\"Songs....\\" is good but not great.
B00002DE0S|5.0|The performance is flawless. His interpretation seems more out of step with the &quot;mainstream&quot; (whatever that is) in No. 2 than in No. 1, but both are very fine. Somewhat slower than others, but in these concerti there is plenty of room for that.<br />I disagree with the negative comments. Music is subject to periodic reinterpretation. It is not the Constitution of the United States or the Holy Bible. I mean, where would we be without Grateful Dead Muzak? :)<br />A fine piece of work.
B00005JKNF|4.0|Directed by Robert Altman, this film take place in the English country side of the 1930s at the lavish and beautiful estate known as Gosford Park. Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his wife, Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas) host a large, weekend hunting party for a distinguished assemblage of guests, who arrive accompanied by their downstairs entourage.<br />It soon becomes clear that the film revolves around a hodge podge of subplots and intrigues, both upstairs and downstairs, some of which are quite interesting, others seemingly less so. They all become pertinent, however, when one of them is murdered by someone in their midst. The film plays as if it were a more upscale and lavish version of the PBS series \\"Mystery\\" or as a film based upon an Agatha Christie mystery.<br />The cast is stellar with excellent performances by all. Maggie Smith is outstanding in the role of Constance Trentham, a snobby, self-absorbed, old biddy in need of money, so that she can continue the lifestyle to which she is accustomed. Jeremy Northam is wonderful playing matinee idol, Ivor Novello, and continues to extend his range, as this role requires him to sing, which he does quite credibly, in fact.<br />Helen Mirren and Eileen Atkins are superlative as the  housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson, and the cook, Mrs. Croft, who are, apparently, at war with each other.  Richard E, Grant, Alan Bates, Derek Jacobi, Emily Watson, and Kelly MacDonald are wonderful as part of the core of downstairs folks through whose eyes the viewer see events unfold.<br />Stephen Fry deserves mention for his brief, though memorable, turn as the laid back Inspector Thompson, whose bumbling investigative efforts seem almost sure to leave the murder unsolved. The audience, however, knows who did it by film's end, even though Inspector Thompson appears not to have a clue.<br />The cinematography is beautiful, as it captures the sumpuousness and richness of the upstairs life in the manor home. It also captures the bleakness and confinement of downstairs life, as well, serving to further underline the great divide that exists between the two. The gulf is further delineated by one of the subplots, which sees the character played by Ryan Phillippe gamely straddle both worlds.<br />The one small problem I found with the film is that,  because there are so many characters with their own subplots and intrigues, the film is somewhat confusing at times. Moreover, some of the dialogue is occasionally unintelligible and garbled, due to overlapping dialogue, which was a bit annoying. Watching the DVD with the English subtitles feature on, however, would probably resolve this issue.<br />The DVD offers a number of interesting features, including an enjoyable mini- ducumentary of Altman's efforts to ensure authenticity of period detail. They apparently hired a cook, a butler, and a maid who were in service during the early nineteen thirties as a sort of sounding board as to how things were done. It also features two commentaries, as well as a short on the making of Gosford Park. It is a value packed DVD and well worth the money. Viewers who like period pieces and mysteries will especially enjoy it.ess and confinement of downstairs life, as well, serving to further underline the great divide that exists between the two.

B00005JKQZ|5.0|This is a superlative film, directed by Ron Howard, someone who is sure to be remembered as a legend in his own time for the number of high quality films that he has directed, thus far. He is certainly one of the finest directors around today, and this film is certainly reflective of his talent. The technique that he employs to illustrate the descent of John Nash into the world of schitzophrenia is highly effective.<br />Loosely based upon the biography of the same name by Sylvia Nasar, the world of schitzophrenia is brought to life in this film by a wonderful screenplay, deft direction, and superb acting. Featuring the life of Nobel Prize laureate, John Nash, this film begins to chronicle his life from 1947, when he was a young, promising, though eccentric, graduate student at Princeton University. The film delineates his lack of social skills, eccentricities, rise to prominence,  marriage, and eventual descent into schitzophrenic hell. It follows his battle with madness and his own way of coping with his inner demons. It also shows how Nash's early work proved to be so influential that it netted him a Nobel Prize decades later. While a number of people have objected to the fact that this film leaves out some of the darker sides of Nash, one would do well to remember that this is not a documentary but merely a dramatization.<br />Russell Crowe gives a memorable portrayal of the afflicted and tormented John Nash, beleagured by the devils that existed only in his mind. Ed Harris is compelling as the slightly sinister Parcher, a shadowy government operative whose existence is intertwined with that of John's. Paul Bettany, as he did in the role of Chaucer in \\"A Knight's Tale\\", once again almost steals the show in the role of John's alleged roommate and friend, Charles. Christopher Plummer is excellent as Dr. Rosen, the psychiatrist who appeals to the dormant rationality in Nash. While Jennifer Connelly gives a very good performance in the role of Alicia, John's caring wife, it does not rise to the level of Oscar worthy, though she won an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.<br />This two disc, widescreen, awards edition DVD clinches this as being worthy of five stars. It is an absolutely value laden two disc DVD. The first disc offers a widescreen version of the film in addition to two commentaries. One is by the director, Ron Howard. The other is by the screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman. The second disc is devoted entirely to special features. Particularly memorable is the feature with John Nash himself, explaining his theory on equilibrium. There is also a feature that shows the Nobel Prize awards of 1994 and Nash's acceptance of his in Economics. All in all, this is a  great package deal and simply first rate.wife, it does not rise to the level of Oscar worthy, though she won an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.<br />This two disc, widescreen, awards edition DVD clinches this as being worthy of five stars.

B000065V1V|2.0|Although \\"Heathen\\" finds Bowie resorting back to more melodic songwriting styles and just plain better music than he has produced in all the years since 1983's \\"Let's Dance\\"; I still maintain that he has been artistically \\"lost\\" after the tuneful 1984 single \\"Blue Jean\\". He has been eager to experiment with trends and musical styles that sometimes work (\\"I'm Afraid of Americans\\") and more often do not work since his disasterous 1987 LP: \\"Never Let Me Down\\". I will give him big points for trying, even though failures such as the \\"Tin Machine\\" should have steered him away from consistantly experimenting in a bad direction throughout the 1990's. I am not at all a fan of Bowie's sloppy 90's material and his lame wanna'-be Nine Inch Nails period.<br />This CD, (while still a far far cry from the brilliance of Bowie's classic 70's albums such as \\"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars\\"), brings him back to a more traditionally \\"Bowie-esque\\" sound. This is David Bowie doing David Bowie, and with the addition of Tony Visconti's production is a breath of fresh air to an artist who's been spinning his wheels aimlessly for years.<br />My biggest complaint is just the doldrum, lifeless spirit of most of the numbers on this CD. It took several listenings until I was even able to actually \\"hear\\" the songs and absorb their melodies into memory (the greatest sin of any popular-music song). While these songs are more traditional for Bowie, let's be honest, they just don't \\"rock\\". They are tame, lethargic, and show a songwriter who isn't sure what he's singing about or why; he's holding-back it seems. What is strange to me is the similarity in style between Heathen and Bowie's 1993 release \\"Black Tie/White Noise\\", yet everyone crucified him at the time of its release and Black Tie ended up selling poorly; no critics were impressed. \\"Jump They Say\\" would fit right in on Heathen both stylistically and musically speaking. Why now, is everyone so impressed all of asudden?<br />Why take my word for it, the proof will be in the pudding: this CD will not likely yield a single hit single for Mr. Bowie and it is obvious why not - not one of the tracks on this latest release have that catchy \\"hook\\" that just hits you in the gut, puts goose-pimples on your forearms, and moves the listener to dance. <br />1983's \\"Let's Dance\\" still stands as David Bowie's last hoorah. I was hoping he would have equaled that work [his last decent LP] by now, but alas, the world still waits.

You can almost feel the words and ideas form from the simplest of emotions and thoughts.
B00003CX5P|5.0|as good as the theater.  Wonderful extra features
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD is one that both teens and adults will love. In some songs, you can tell that she's singing from a teen perspective, but it wouldn't be real if it didn't have any of those songs. Musically, this CD is just as grown up as anything the Bangles or Go Gos did. Avril is an innovator and a genius! She has taken the music of Alanis, Pink, and Jewel, and has added her own punk & folk distinctiveness. Songs like Sk8ter Boi already have timeless melodies. If you love the power pop style, this is one of the best CDs you could buy. The lyrics have room for growth structurally, but they have loads of charisma. This CD is a bit more rough around the edges than Michelle Branch's CD, but it's hard to pick a favorite of the two. For the people saying she's not punk enough musically, remember that a punk attitude is most important. I'm convinced that she's not fake. Even the Ramones weren't always hardcore, yet they deserved the punk label. She's young, and I think she'll grow more punk and alternative musically. But, I hope she doesn't lose the charm of Let Go!
B00003CXTG|3.0|Nice extra feautures.  But the movie is on two discs.  Annoying having to change discs midway through even though DVDs can hold 4 hours on a side when double layered.<br />Titanic and Green Mile, which are about the same length as Pearl Habor, fit the movie on one disk.  <br />I'd expect this on VHS but not on DVD
B000066NW0|4.0|Here's the track by track review:<br />1.  \\"Losing Grip\\":  A little choppy in the beginning, it smooths out when Avril starts singing.  Then the chorus just totally rocks out and she gives [an angry] vocal arrangement.  I can tell she was feeling this song when she sang it.<br />2.  \\"Complicated\\":  The first single released by Avril.  Very good choice for her first single.  It represents her vocal range and writing ability.  I first heard this song by a friend a couple of months ago, and I'm so glad she did!!<br />3.  \\"Sk8er Boi\\":  This is probably the 'hardest' rocking song on the CD, yet it has potential to be on the radio, which is hard to come by.  This is a cool 'story' song, kinda like \\"Janie's Got a Gun\\" by Aerosmith (in that story sense.)<br />4.  \\"I'm With You\\":  A radical departure from the first 3 songs.  This song is very flowy and good, though it has that Avril edge which makes the song personally her own.  The instruments are used very well in this song.<br />5.  \\"Mobile\\":  This has a bouncy beat like what a 'mobile' would.  I love the line \\"this sucks, gotta pack up and leave again.\\"  If you see the video on the computer on the CD, it's very representive of this song, which would make a perfect music video.<br />6.  \\"Unwanted\\":  Kinda quiet at the beginning, then turns hard rockin'.  This reminds me of what happened to one of my friends, I don't want to get into it, but every song has a meaning to it and this is one of them.<br />7.  \\"Tomorrow\\":  Some people say that this is a ballad.  In the beginning it is, but it kinda turns into a mid-tiempo piece.  It's a sentimental piece that you wouldn't expect out of Avril.  It's a nice little tune.<br />8.  \\"Anything but Ordinary\\":  Sounds a little like \\"Too Bad\\" by Nickleback at the beginning then it turns into this song.  I hate songs that do that.  But it turns into a good song, I especially like the chorus.<br />9.  \\"Things I'll Never Say\\":  This is probably the most 'poppy' song on the album, with all the 'la-la-la-la's.  This reminds me of what it's like to be a teen, cuz it's all true.  It's actually a good tune.<br />10.  \\"My World\\":  I can totally understand where Avril's coming from on this song, because she talks about living in a small town of like 5000 people.  I live in a small town of 4000 people so it's just kinda interesting what she has to say about small town life and her world.<br />11.  \\"Nobody's Fool\\":  I don't like the mini rapping in this song, because Avril's better at singing than rapping.  But the chorus is better than the chorus.  I don't know who she sounds like in the chorus, but it sounds very familiar.<br />12.  \\"Too Much to Ask\\":  Good acoustic guitar at the beginning, it's kind of like a pain ridden song.  But it has a good melody in it and the lyrics are very reflective.  <br />13.  \\"Naked\\":  The album ends on this kind of sour note, it's just kinda odd.  The music is choppy and the lyrics are 'there'.  Avril voice is very strange on it.  Though it's kinda flowy too.<br />Overall review:  4 stars:  A very good debut CD by Avril Lavigne.  I expect more out of this grrl.  I just hope she doesn't get dragged down by all of these people who say she's just like Alanis Morisette.  Because she isn't, she's just Avril and she has her own style and writing abilities.
0898159156|5.0|D'amato does a great job in how he presents the many techniques for growing cp's. He gives a realistic description of how tolerant they are. It prompted me to take many of my plants out of the terrarium, with great success. Most other books only suggest that if you already live in sarracenia territory. The species-by-species description is very helpful, almost a field guide. I use it to identify the little seedlings that I almost always get extra in commercial orders. Thanks Cook's Carnivores for those little unexpected extras.
B000067CPX|3.0|I thought Californication was one of the best albums I have ever heard.  It would take a lot for me to be satisfied with \\"By The Way\\".  The Chili Peppers assure a decent album by packing 16 tracks onto this album, many of which, including the title track, By the Way, Tear, and The Zephyr Song are unique and enjoyable to listen to.  Some of the others simply sound too much alike.  I love the sound of these guys and I will keep listening, but I feel that in a year or so, the album I will resort to for my Chili Pepper fix will be Californication or Blood Sugar Sex Magik.
0316666343|5.0|I bought this book after seeing Anna Quindlen on the Today show and felt the book lived up to the publicity.  I finished the book last night and am so sorry to have finished it, still wanting to know what is happening with Susie and her family.   Ironically, my husband is out of town on an extended trip and I actually felt so lonely reading this book, echoing Susie's feelings about wanting to be with her family.  I enjoyed the premise of the story, but I also think the strength of book is the quality of the writing.  I look forward to future books from Alice Sebold.
0316666343|3.0|This book was alright. I read it while traveling on business to pass the flying time. It was entertaining to say the most. I regret spending the money on the hardback. I would recomend buying it when the paperback comes out or get it from the library. The most interesting part is that the young girl is teling the story from heaven. Not the best book but not the worst either.
0380977788|2.0|Neil Gaiman is definitely a creative powerhouse, there's not questioning that. But this book really isn't worth all the hype surrounding it.<br />Some of the imagery created by Gaiman is very clever and chilling, but the execution falls flat. It reads like a \\"Choose Your Own Adventure\\" book, and I never really felt the main character was in any real danger (just creepy circumstances).  And even though the evil mother character is very well written, her actions and origins seem a bit vague so it all falls a bit flat.<br />Although the book's jacket touts it as the next Alice in Wonderland, this book lacks the wit and charm to be a book for all ages. Kids will no doubt be frightened by by Gaiman's creepy imagery, but as they grow older, they'll begin to wonder exactly why as this book lacks the bite it's teeth imply...<br />I'd stick to Road Dahl or The Brothers Grim...
0380789035|5.0|In American Gods, Neil Gaiman continues to write what he does best--adult fairytales about the monsters, spirits and deities that hide in the corner of modern civilization.  From the world dreams to the London subway system, he explores the various anthropomorphic facets of human existence with elegance and a dry wit.<br />This time out, his playground is the United States of America.  Like many of his tales, the protagonists are on a quest, but end up travelling farther in their own psyches than in the physical(?) world.  In this case, atop the backdrop of a divine conflict--the old gods and demons immigrants brought to the American continent versus the new gods of money and telecommunications--Shadow comes to terms with who he is.<br />I found this to be right up there with his other novel, Neverwhere, and probably surpassing that one in originality of concepts.
B000065U1N|5.0|what a great movie.  tons of action, tons of movie stars.  lots of explosions and action!<br />it has a decent storyline abt a debacle in africa.  must of had a billion extras in this movie.  but anyways, storyline abt a mission goof up that cost the US rangers and delta force quite a bit of time to evacuate their forces that were stranded in hostile territory.  realistic fight scenes and a glimpse into how the terrain and fighting might have looked like.
B000068QY7|2.0|I've always enjoyed the expansive, panoramic feeling of Oasis's (reputedly) cocaine-driven music, but detested their (allegedly) cocaine-fueled antisocial behaviour.<br />The new album still sounds quite like Oasis. The much touted single-in-waiting &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; tries to recall the sweeping grandeur of Oasis classics &quot;Slide Away&quot; and &quot;Supernova,&quot; but comes over as a tired epic. Another symptom of the band's diminishing circles is the degree to which tweeness has replaced swagger in such songs as &quot;Songbird&quot; and &quot;Little by Little.&quot;<br />The main problem seems to be that despite the infusion of new blood -- Gem Archer and Andy Bell each do a Ringo on the album by writing a song -- Oasis are jaded. On recent single &quot;The Hindu Times,&quot; they revealingly sing, &quot;I get so high I just can't feel it.&quot; Still, it's nice to know that the Gallaghers are already planning the next stage of their career -- emulating MTV's hit fly-on-the-wall reality drama, &quot;The Osbournes,&quot; with one of their own.

B0000025D0|5.0|Oh my, what an amazing record.  It was great in its time, 1978, but very surprising to hear the anger, and stunning to hear the minimalist approach after his first three albums, which were variously comparable to Bob Dylan (his first album) and some kind of Spectorish/Gershwinesque rock opera (his next two, including Born to Run).<br />This record set the tone for the rest of his career so far.  It leads directly to The River, Nebraska, Born in the USA, Tunnel of Love and Tom Joad.  Songs that are tightly-focused, emotionally clear, plain-spoken yet rich with compelling imagery that is carried through the entire song.  The music gets increasingly spare and tough, and draws upon more universal influences.  This album is where that approach is at its freshest. There's not as much party music on it as you'll find on some of his later albums, but at the same time it isn't as bleak as Nebraska or Tom Joad.  It is, in a word, perfect.<br />The ultimate perfection is found on two songs, &quot;Racing in the Streets&quot; and the title track.  Each one was a side-closer on the original LP.  They are haunting, powerful, unforgettable songs that give you chills every time you hear them. They are very sad, and very real.  The greatest short story writer you can name, Chekhov, Hemingway, Carver, would have been proud to write these songs.

0790729350|5.0|I loved this film.  Take a wonderful trip down memory lane.  Keith Moon, John Entwhistle, Jimi, Janis, The Bear - in all their glory.  I must admit I shed a tear or two watching this movie.  I saw it at the pictures as a teenager and it has remained embedded in my mind ever since.  Young Joe Cocker, young CSN, young Carlos - performers I have seen in recent years - still marvelleous - but oh! how young we all were...<br />This was truly the end of an era. Of thinking that loving your fellow man and having a few joints would change the world.  Look back and long for a simpler time.  As Bono once said &quot;Glorify the past when the future dries up&quot;
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie was totally awesome. Yes, it did miss out on some things on the book that we all would have liked to see more of, more Quidditch for example, but it was pretty well done. The special effects were cool, and the acting for most characters was great. It made the story come to life even more, and for those that don't like to read, you just have to see the movie. The characters were chosen perfectly, they fit their roles like a sock fits its owner...(ok, bad analogy, but you get the point). Everyone should experience the magical world of Harry Potter. From the moment you first see the characters, you are hooked. Everyone should have this movie! A must have for the Harry Potter fan!!!
B000003TAL|4.0|Sonic Youth is one of the great NYC rock and roll bands. Theoretically, they are the new Velvet Underground. This is both true and false. They are picking up where VU left off but putting their own slant on it. Its sort of like their whole career is white light whight heat. This is a great rock album. The only thing that ruins it is the lack of any true classic song. Sonic Youth doesn't seem to have much of an ability to write a single but they can craft a unique sonic experience. Daydream Nation is something of an underground masterpiece.
B000065U1N|4.0|This movie was in truth, a wonderful movie. It told the tale very well and was very well done. The effects were good, and the acting was wonderful, but there was so much blood and gore. It had so much blood that you really had to have a strong stomach, and a strong head. Yet it was emotional and perfect for a war film.

The best spy thriller ever.
B000067CPX|5.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers new CD is proof that Anthony Kiedis &amp; the crew are here to stay,creating songs that are truly excellent and which sound great. I thought it would be very difficult to match the quality of Californication,but they have done it with ease. Yeah,there are quite a few 'mellow' songs,but they are all really creative and you can hear the talent and emotion in the way Kiedis flows with his voice - with Flea,etc,supplying incredible music to go along with his vocals. The more you listen to the CD &amp; soak in all the great songs,the better they get.&quot;By The Way&quot; is one of the best albums out this year. Highly recommended!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|It is not often that I will buy a CD by an artist unknown to me, but ROOM FOR SQUARES was one of those rare exceptions.  After hearing a few tracks on the overhead at Barnes and Noble and unable to resist the funky beats, I had to know who this guy was, and why I hadn't heard of him.<BR>Jazzy cool and smokin' hot, ROOM FOR SQUARES is a consistently fine album with infectious melodies and descriptive, revealing lyrics.  If sold-out shows are any indication, John Mayer's rising star should burn bright for a long time.
B000067CPX|4.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers early efforts were impressive for their sheer speed and funkiness, no doubt. But after a couple spins, it became too much of a good thing. Not enough diversity. Now an older, wiser group of sock-wearers have matured into a band that seems very comfortable in their skin. Flea is happy with simple melodic baselines, but will still jam when necessary. Anthony sings etherel lyrics, but can still dish out the tongue-twisters. Most importantly, the reunion with John on guitar since Californication has brought the magic back. By The Way is not the masterpiece I believe Californication to be, but tracks such as \\"Dosed\\" and \\"I Could Die For You\\" remind me just how good songs can be.
B00004UEDQ|3.0|I don't really like Sandra Bullock, personally.  However, I thought that she was absolutely perfect for the role that she played.  Someone reccomended that I watch this film to study the way rehab worked because I was writing a paper on the 12 steps for school.  Well, the movie was pretty accurate with the way rehab is in real life and the acting was ok.  However, there was something about the movie that just bored me.  Maybe it's because I was watching it for research instead of for fun...who knows? I might reccomend this to someone learning about rehab or alchoholism, but not to someone who wants to see an entertaining film.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Seinfeld epitomises the nineties, yet it remains contemporary & splendidly funny even nowadays. It is a sin not to release a DVD set with all of the episodes if you have a chance to do it. To whom it may concern, you must apply pressure for the set to be released.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This was one of the most clever and entertaining films I have seen in my entire life. It was filled with wonderful performances and interesting twists in the plot.  The movie is about an insomniac, played by Edward Nortion.  Because Edward Norton's character is never named, I will call him \\"Ed\\".  Ed is only able to go to sleep, once he has had a good cry.  So, he goes to depressing groups filled with men that are dying of cancer.  All of a sudden, a creepy woman, Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), starts going to these groups, which annoys Ed very much and it prevents him from sleeping.  Later on, while on a plane, Ed meets Tyler(Brad Pitt) and eventually moves in with Tyler because his house was burnt down.<br />  Later on, while fighting, Tyler and Ed find out that fighting really helps them let out their emotions and helps them sleep as well.  As a result, they start a secret club called \\"fight club\\", in which random men attend to fight eachother and let out their anger.  The club becomes very popular, and the men in the group form a sort of cult.  In this cult, the men start \\"project mayhem\\" in which they cause trouble around the world.<br />  One day, Tyler is gone, which leaves Ed alone with the cult and project mayhem.  Ed can't handle all that pressure, so he leaves and looks for Tyler.  For some weird reason, everyone keeps mistaking Ed for Tyler.  I'm not going to give anymore of the story away.  This is one of my favorites, and I reccomend it to anyone who can appreciate a brilliantly made film.  Go see this!
B00000BKDX|5.0|By the release of this album, 1985, iron maiden were, via the release of Powerslave (1984), the biggest metal band on the planet. live after death captures the power of the band at their peak. From the untro of churchill's speak leading to the rat ta tat of aces high to the extended version of running free which closes the album it does not let up. the track listing leans towards peice of mind and powerslave with eleven out of the eighteen tracks coming from those albums. the majority of the songs are delivered faster than the originals. Special mention must be made be of possibly definitive versions of hallowed by thy name and powerslave. musically the band is on top form which is to be expected considering the length of the world slavery tour which the album is taken from (August 1984 to July 1985). The lung capacity of the bruce dickinson is quite frankly amazing, but his intersong banter is rather odd, for example, his introduction to the rime of the anicent mariner. however the version of the song which they deliver is very good as well as being atmospheric. for a defintive example of maiden live this album has yet to be surpassed
6303443214|4.0|I haven't seen a vampire film as good as this one since \\"Nosferatu\\".  All the actors did an excellent job portraying vampires, especially Kirsten Dunst.  This was not an easy role for a child actor in their first film.  It was about a man named Louis(Brad Pitt), who was bit and turned into a vampire by Lestat (Tom Cruise).  Louis is having a hard time coping with drinking blood and murdering people.  However, he can't fight his urges any longer and he bites a little girl, Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), which turns her into a vampire as well.  Soon, Lestat, Louis and Claudia become a little family and shares a house.<br />  After a considerable amount of time, Louis and Claudia can no long bear to live with Lestat any longer.  So, Claudia tricks Lestat into drinking blood from a corpse, which causes him to rot and sort of go into a coma.  At that, Louis and Claudia run away together and live a pretty happy life for a while.  I don't want to spoil anything, so I am going to stop talking.  You should see this if you like vamp movies.
1573225517|5.0|i saw the movie of this last year and liked it a lot. so a couple of weeks ago I thought I'd read the book. so I did and I was not disappointed. It had more than the movie did maybe it didnt have as much more as I thought it did because I haven't seen the movie in a long time. my only complaint reaaly is in the book Dick's girlfriend is just some girl he met who doesn't know much about music and in the movie. they meet in the store discussing the clash's influence on green day. but I still loved this book. Nick Hornby is a great author.
0783246641|4.0|This movie was about a total psycho, Patrick (Christian Bale), who has a lust for killing people.  Patrick is very vain and kills people very casually, it's humorous how bazaar he is.  I thought it was pretty funny, but a little too weird at times.  I wouldn't reccomend it to just anyone, not all people are able to find humor in a crazy businessman that goes around on killing sprees.
078322687X|5.0|I was born the year this movie came out. But I think it has to be the best teen movie ever. Don't get me wrong I liked american pie and 10 things I hate about you, but american pie was just funny no serious stuff. and that is the problem with new teen movies. or if they try to be as good as this one dramatically the acting is horrible. but this movie is perfect the funny things like when bender makes fun of mr. vernon. to when all 5 teens are sitting in the circle confessing things and what not. so if you are a teen who doesn't seem to get enough out of newer teen movies i highly reccomend this one.
B00005O5CM|4.0|The film stars Reese Witherspoon as a ditzy college graduate named Elle, who goes to Harvard Law School to win her ex-boyfriend back.  While in Harvard, Elle realizes that she has the brains to actually be a lawyer and not just attend Harvard for her ex anymore.  This movie was very funny and entertaining.  It's definately worth seeing.
B000066NW0|4.0|There are magazines - reviews - fans - songs - and the new Avril Lavigne CD, Let Go. I listen 2 radio stations like Kiss (96.1) or B-94 (93.7), and as soon as I turn my radio on there is some Avril Lavigne song on like Complicated or Sk8r Boi. And there it is. As soon as I hear one of her songs twice, I'll know the whole thing. <BR> Avril is between images. She has songs that play on the radio about 50 times a-day, and others that people skip sometimes. Her Pink-Britney style has brought her a long way and I recomend this CD to anyone who has good taste.
B0000524E5|4.0|This film is about a young woman, Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo), who moves to NY to make it big as a song writer.  In order to make some extra money after she is robbed, she works at a bar called &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;.  Before she started working at the bar, she had very bad stage fright. However, with the combination of working in the bar and a boyfriend to boost her confidence, Violet overcomes her stage fright.  This movie was pretty entertaining and I really like Piper Perabo. I reccomend this to any Perabo fan.
0446608955|5.0|i think this book was great! definitely his best! although God's plan could've been mentioned less, it didn't bother me that much. i love this book!
6304675348|4.0|I really liked this movie.  It mixed laughs with murder really well.  It is about a teen, Sidney(Neve Campbell), who's mother was murdered and she is still having trouble deciding if the man jailed for the murder really is guilty or not.  Soon, she is put under more pressure and trauma when tons of people in her town are getting murdered by a man in a Halloween mask, and when the killer also pursues her.  It's quite an entertaining movie, and a good scare.  If you haven't seen it, you're missing out.
B0000640S1|4.0|John Rambo is just a guy who wants to be left alone so he can find an old comrade of his from the Vietnam war. But as he walks into a small town he is quickly harassed by a local lawman. John tries to keep his cool as the foul mouthed law man escorts him back to the end of the city limits, basically letting him know that he is not welcomed. But, as the sheriff drives away, he looks in his rear view mirror to find John making his way back into town. Infuriated, the sheriff stops this time and arrests John, even though he had done nothing wrong, BIG MISTAKE!!! You see John is an ex Green Beret, and one of the Army's best. Once John is taken into the police department, he is roughed up by deputies left and right. But, when they try to clean him up and give him a shave, John has a flash back to when he was a POW. He see's the razor as a knife, and he goes off the deep end. He royally kicks butt, and makes his escape out into the wilderness. As the search for him begins, the posse quickly learns that this is no run-of-the-mill kind of guy, he's smart, very smart. Once he's out in the wilderness, John quickly regains his wits, and studies how to make his next move. Lots of drama, lots of action, suspense, and terror. Does he make it out alive? You don't honestly think I would tell you do you?<BR>(grinning) The movie has strong language but, thankfully no sex scenes. This is the movie that started not only a trend, but a term as well. The Rambo knives became a very popular and hot collectible and the term \\"Rambo\\" was given to anyone who displayed a gung-ho attitude. This movie is inspiring, and well worth it to see several times over. The plot is excellent, and the movie is now considered a classic!!!
B00005ATQI|5.0|These days, all \\"horror\\" movies are just full of blood instead of actual horror.  However, \\"The Shining\\" is filled with horror and it actually scared me, which is rare.  It is about a writer, Jack (Jack Nicholson), who decides to live in a hotel during the winter, with just his son and wife, and no one else in the hotel.  Jack's son can read minds and sense ghosts, which comes in handy because the hotel is filled with ghosts and supernatural beings.<br />         As time goes by, Jack starts to grow crazier and crazier, developing writer's block, while Jack's family is starting to fear him.  During their stay at this haunted hotel, the family is constantly scared by ghosts of people that were murdered in the hotel.  Also, later on, Jack tries to murder is family with an ax!  I am not goin to give away any more of the film, I will let you go and rent it yourself.  Any horror fan will love this one.
B000066NW0|5.0|When it comes to talking about Avril Lavigne's debut album, &quot;Lets Go,&quot; the first word that comes to my mind is &quot;wow!&quot; The lyrical content is what really got me.  The music and the themes to the songs are so easy to relate to for teenagers especially.  The lyrics are REAL, they're about REAL things that people go through every single day.  The edgy songs such as &quot;Losing Grip&quot; and &quot;Unwanted&quot; show the anger and frustration people can go through from the way they've been treated by others because maybe they don't appear to be good enough, yet the song &quot;Tomorrow&quot; provides comfort in letting you know there's always another day.  I have so much respect for Avril for being a 17 year old woman and breaking away from that Britney Spears image that every young female seems to have these days.  I also respect the fact that this girl is not afraid to speak her mind in her songs, and share her feelings.  I admire her, I support her, and I highly recommend that people buy this album.  Avril's gonna go far, and I wish her the best life has to offer.  She deserves it.
B000022TSW|5.0|I am a huge fan of Trey Parker and Matt Stone.  I love \\"South Park\\" the TV show, and the movie was even better.  I was laughing so hard through the entire thing!  The movie is about how Canada has a very negative effect on American youth when an inappropriate film by Terrance and Phillip is released.  After children in South Park view the movie \\"Asses of Fire\\", they all start using foul language and Kyle's mom declares war on Canada.  This movie is hilarious, and you aren't a true \\"South Park\\" fan if you haven't seen this movie.  Even people that don't like \\"South Park\\" will still find this movie humorous.
B00006690F|5.0|i hadn't listend to eminem in almost a year and a half, until i decided to take a chance and download all the tracks on this album.  i was totally blown away, and i was at the store on tuesday to pick this one up, as it's totally worth the cash.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I am a fan of the Spiderman comic books, and I was incredibly satisfied with the way \\"Spiderman\\" the movie turned out.  Although in the book, Spiderman wasn't able to naturally produce a web, but I like the way the film changed that.  Any an of the comic should go see this movie, they won't be dissapointed.  I didn't think Tobey Maguire would be able to pull it off, but he did. This movie was great!
B000002H97|3.0|Kirk still plays the great solos.  Lars still plays the drums like there is no tommorrow, even Jason gets in some good licks in this CD.  But still Hetfield's lyrics need some work.  It sort of changes the whole perspective of Metallica.  There is no anti-war songs or songs about people dying because of the government.  There is no songs about famous books like \\"One\\" and \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls.\\"  Hetfield wrote some great music, but not so great lyrics.  I'm giving this CD three stars because Metallica still has great music, but it sort of gives them a different look in this CD.  If you like the old stuff then this probably isn't your CD.  If you like some different things out of Metallica you may want to try it.  Overall it was a good CD.
B00003CXFU|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this film at first, having a bad opinion of Julia Roberts's acting abilities.  However, I was pleasantly suprised to find that she infact does have talent.  The film is based on the true story of a big company contaminating the water of a town with chromium 6 and telling the residents that it was good for them.  Erin (Julia Roberts) finds out about it, and makes the company pay $334,000,000 to the residents that were affected by the contaminated water.  Roberts definately deserved the Oscar for this one.
6305538018|4.0|I was drug to the theater at 12 at night to see this. I never even heard of Cronenberg. Big Surprise, I was into this thing start to finish. I thought the Matrix was horrible and after I saw this I thought, \\"now thats a real story.\\" ... If you watch this you'll see how unpredictable everything turns out. Jude Law is excellent in this. If you liked him in AI you'll see but another great execution by him. The chinese resturaunt scene is hilarious. Classic! This movie is great and will be your little secret since not to many people have even heard of it.<BR>4 stars because I hear the Canadien version has bonus material. Theres none on the US version.
B00005T30L|5.0|I love this film.  It mixes together comedy and drama really well.  Steve Buscemi was great in his role as the nerdy record collector.  The movie was about an 18 year old girl, Enid(Thora Birch), who just graduated high school and doesn't quite know what she wants out of life.  Her best friend, Rebecca(Scarlett Johanson), keeps nagging her about moving into an apartment with her.  While playing a prank on a lonely middle-aged man, Seymour (Steve Buscemi), Enid becomes very close to him and learns that he is very interesting.  Although this film stars teen actresses, it is not a teen movie.  I highly reccomend this to everyone, it was THAT good!
B00005PJ8I|1.0|The movie was fine.  Good.  Okay.  Whatever.  But if I had known it was a Fed-Ex commercial, I would have avoided it.  Whatever happened to making up company names so that you don't become a SELL-OUT?  Go ahead, try to watch this movie and ignore FED-EX continually flashing in your face.  Believe me, they did NOT have to do it.  All it does is distract and disrupt to make them MORE MONEY that they DON'T NEED.  I say: DON'T SEE IT ON PRINCIPLE.  This movie isn't good enough to be worth supporting a sell-out.  I gave it one star to make a dent in the ratings, but without the Fed-Ex, it's maybe a two &amp; a half.
B000067CPX|5.0|I agree with guys who wrote that Peppers lost spirituality in their songs. It looks like they are doing a marketing research on which style we should go next. If it's like this then I vote for \\"Can't stop\\" song and \\"Zephyr\\", or at least \\"By the Way\\". Sure, with this album they will gain different listeners group, as they started doing this from \\"Californication\\", and then feed them with more and more pop songs. <BR>Sad. <BR>I put 5 stars not to lower their sales on Amazon in the honor of their previous albums.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I once read that David Bowie used to construct his song lyrics by wrting random phrases and words on strips of paper and then plucking them out of a proverbial hat and assembling them as they came. <BR>Lynch apparently employs a similar approach with his film making, as this admittedly visually appealing mish-mash of symbolism just skitters from one scene to something completely unrelated until the credits roll.<BR>The acting is ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL. I have to stress this, as everyone else here comments on Oscar nomination performances, but trust me, the level of acting is comparable to Yankee soap operas (perhaps purposely?) and everyone just ambles about spouting vacuous lines at one another.<BR>I've seen some tripe in my time and this is up there with J-Lo's Angel Eyes.
B000009EAD|5.0|The title of my review says it all, this is one of the best cds I've ever bought.  Iced Earth is one of the best bands out today, probably the best actually, since alot of the best metal bands aren't as good as they used to be.  But this cd has much more than the average metal album.  It has some pretty brutal thrash(Disciples of The Lie, Stand Alone), beautiful ballads(Melancholy and Watching Over Me, which was written about how Jon Shaffer's best friend died from living a reckless life, very emotional)and some Maiden/Priest influenced riffs and solos.Jon Shaffer is one of the best rythym guitarists ever, up there with James Hetfield and Dave Mustaine, and an even better songwriter.  Larry Tarnowski's leads fit perfectly.  Then there's Matt Barlow.  Probably the best singer I've ever heard.  He can display the emotion on sogs like &quot;Watching Over Me&quot; and then the brutal growl of &quot;Disciples Of The Lie&quot;.  Listen to those two songs back to back and you'll be convinced of how good he is. While all the songs are amazing, I guess my favorites are &quot;Watching Over Me&quot;, &quot;Consequences&quot;, and the Something Wicked trilogy(the music the lyrics, everything about it is perfect!).  This was my first Iced Earth album, and I absolutely loved it, so I definitely recommend this is you're looking to get into Iced Earth.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|a backwards movie with surprise beginnings! By going backwards we are like the lead character - we don't know what happened shortly before what is happening now.  Unlike the lead character, we do have the advantage of knowing his future. But that does not help us anticipate his past.  Very well done movie that I don't mind watching over and over.
B000001FS3|2.0|I never understood the acclaim this album received.  It isn't a bad album; just inferior to all of U2's previous work and most of their later work.<br />U2 deserves a great deal of credit for their passionate songwriting, and for developing a unique sound and then evolving in new directions.  This cd is at the mid-point: it has the pure early sound, for the most part, but does nothing new with it.  The songs have a sameness, and run together.<br />I suppose the critics note that this album was a shift from the political to the personal, if not an evolution in other ways.  But U2 had done songs on the personal level before, and done them much better.  Listen to &quot;Bad&quot; on Unforgettable Fire.  That single song contains twice the passion of this entire album.<br />The following are better U2 cds:  War, The Unforgettable Fire, Achtung Baby, Zooropa, October, and Boy.  The Joshua Tree, I suppose, is better than Rattle and Hum and Pop.  It rates pretty low in the scale of &quot;must have&quot; U2 cds.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I have watched this movie many many times since purchasing it- 'really really'.  Beautiful animation, good story, good comedy, good action, I just don't get tired of it and I highly recommend Shrek as an addition to your DVD collection.
B000062XM7|5.0|Michael Mann's \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is a throwback movie.  In fact, its a remake.  Its plot, character development, and dialogue are taken more from the 1936 movie version of LOTM than from James Fennimore Cooper's novel.  The 1936 movie took the setting, main characters, and basic plot from the novel, but then reworked everything to make a more dramatic, romantic, and adventurous story which could told on film in less than two hours.  Essentially, Mann's LOTM is a modern retelling of the 1936 version with fanastic cinematography, a memorable score, beautiful locations, and thrilling, terrifically choreographed battle sequences.  However, it retains the classic feel of a 1930's adventure movie.  (There is no foul language, nudity, or sex scenes.)<br />It's the summer of 1757, the third year of the French and Indian War, and the three surviving members of the Mohicans, Chingachgook (Russell Means) and his two sons, Uncus, his blood son (Eric Schweig) and Hawkeye, his adopted English son (Daniel Day-Lewis), continue to live the traditional Mohican life of hunting and trapping on the New York frontier.  Seeing the on-going war as a struggle between greedy European powers, the Mohicans refuse to join in the fighting.  Meanwhile, young British Major Duncan Heywood (Steven Waddington) has arrived in Albany to meet with Cora Munro (Madeliene Stowe), to whom he has made a marriage proposal, and her fragile, younger sister, Alice (Jodhi Maye).  Heywood is to accompany the sisters to Fort William Henry where they are to rendevous with their father, the fort's commander, Col. Munro (Maurice Roeves).  On the way to the fort, Heywood and the Munros find themselves betrayed by Magua (Wes Studi), who they had thought was a pro-British Mohawk, but instead is a pro-French Huron.  However, Magua's betrayal has nothing to do with his political allegiances, but with his vow of blood vengeance against Col. Munro and all \\"his seed.\\"  Just when it looks like Magua is about to exacthis revenge upon Munro's children, fate intervenes as the Mohicans cast aside their neutrality to come to the aid of the women.  The rest of the movie deals with how the above characters' lives are effected by war, romance (mostly the irresistable attraction between Cora and Hawkeye), jealousy, duty, and vengeance.<br />Mann's LOTM is a romance, and not just in the fact that one smoldering glance between Hawkeye and Cora generates more heat than all movies which reduce passion to nude couples grappling with each other in fake ecatasy.  Romance in LOTM is also of an image of time and place.  In Mann's 18th century frontier men always remained clean shaven, long hair was washed, combed, and conditioned, everyone had a dental plan, no mosquitos, no grease, no smudged warpaint, and everyone was good looking.  LOTM is quite simply a picture of a world that never existed.  But it's also a picture of a world which we wish existed and that is one of the big reasons this movie is such a triumph.<br />LOTM has its faults.  It sometimes requires a healthy dose of a suspension of disbelief to watch our heroes reload those muzzle loaders in seconds while at a full run.  Also, in one scene our heroes must flee because they can't fight with wet powder, but later they seem to have magically found a powder supply in the middle of the woods.  (Not to mention they keep finding canoes at the most convenient times and the entire \\"about to go over the waterfall scene.\\")  The romantic subplot between Uncus and Alice is woefully underdeveloped, which is a huge shame because that relationship results in the heartbreaking climax of the movie.  Also, underdeveloped are the characters of Chingachgook and Uncus and the entire \\"last of the Mohican\\" storyline.  Finally, there are some PC elements here: Hawkeye's white family were killed not by Indians but by French trappers, French Gen. Montcalm is shown actually encouraging the Fort William Henry massacre, and the entire dialogue in the Huron village has nothing to do with the reality of relations between the Europeans and AmerIndians in the mid-18th century.  However, PC is to be expected in any movie made about AmerIndians and thankfully LOTM does not carry it to a goofy extreme.<br />Disbelief and quibbles of PC aside, LOTM is a terrific movie.  A thrilling movie in the mold of a 1930's classic adventure film redone for modern audiences.  It's exciting, romantic, and just darn good!
B000063K2W|5.0|The story is interesting and I definately would watch it again several times.  I am not a fan of old movies, but this film has lots of catty remarks and relationship twists to keep me interested.  The acting is good.
B000066NW0|1.0|I applaud this youngster for creating on real insturments instead of just hiring a guy to lay down a bunch of lazy electronic nothing. That said,it's about all that sets this apart from the rest of the lackluster music that everybody seems to love. It's the same old same old-but god bless you if it bakes your bread. Her youthful \\"sexuality\\" is on display here,if in a much more dignified way than Miss Spears. If you think it's not you're fooling yourself. For once when you say the lyrics sound like they are the poetry of a teenage girl it's really true. Man these are some boring and simple words set to very average musical backing. These songs are lightweight and full of \\"attempted\\" depth. All I can say is that maybe she will grow up with her fans and make some music that's got some meat to it. Sk8 on down to the record shop and try again.
B000067CPX|5.0|What can one say? This is red hot stuff! kiedis is a wordsmith... Frusciante is a guitar wiz...and of course you know about Flea and Smith. This stuff is the kind of groove you play at a hopping party...you don't stop...these guys are moving towards the future..they pull off brilliance that has never been heard before...Talent is elusive and often missed... Yet the Chili Peppers are on to something..they know the importance of moving forward...Talent shmallent...who cares...they are doing what they are doing... I ask no questions...I can't do what they have accomplished over the years...who has? very few...That says a lot. The tracks conjure up such a pure, sincere motivated sound...\\"By The Way\\" is a convincing opening salvo...added to it is a infectious rap by Anthony...makes the whole song sound so different from anything before...Makes one want to jump up and down...UnIversally Speaking almost sounds like an opening for a Counting Crows song...but quickly turns into a U2 sounding score...But just when ya think you have this song tabbed it sounds as if Elton John and Brian Wilson may have been included in this session YET IT IS SO DARN GOOD...IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT THIS IS ORIGINAL...IT COULD ONLY COME FROM THE CHILIPEPPERS...NOONE ELSE...such brilliance...Track Three...the flea song....Just listen to the bassline...Exceptional...Best thing since Joe Jackson's stepping out! Track 4...Compelling deep,dark,telling...Track 5...Can you just imagine listening to this in open air! Track 6...such a good groove Anthony's vocals fit this song like a glove...Great harmonies. Track 7...get ready to rock! Track 8 \\"I could Die for You\\"...The time where the party finds you kissing a beautiful stanger as the blue water reflects off the summer sky...Maybe wiping happy tears from her beautiful face..Midnight...beautiful opening orchestration...lends itself to a Johnny Marr style kickin riff...Great message...\\"Cabron\\"....a truly great song...what an opening riff...Anthony sings withsuch convictiom and insight \\"EVERYONE WOULD TAKE A CUE FROM ANYTHING YOU DO IF YOU WANT THEM TO.\\" Not no mention the infectious Chorus. \\"Tear\\" the next song has such a strong step into the opening minute...as Anthony proclainms \\"this is my time\\"...The beach boys...I hope would\\"ve this song. Track 13...sounds like something Gwen Stefani and No Doubt is perfect for...BUT HAVEN'T DONE...Raw... Again...Fast lyrics and equally good guitar work!!It may be a \\"Minor Thing\\" But it is sure is catchy! \\"Warm Tape\\"...melodic almost spooky opening...wow...This song has something to say musically...Venice Queen polishes this cd...Anyone who has experienced Venice,Ca will feel the groove and make the ones who haven't been want to be there...Sigh...final statement...This is a benchmark Cd...
B000067CPX|2.0|Now that I've had some time to really listen to this, it's not a very good album.  There are a few highlights - title track, Dosed, Cabron - but Sgt. Peppers and Pet Sounds are bad role models for this band.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This is probably the first CD that I can actually listen to completely through, without having to skip a song! I enjoy every one of these fabulous songs, and I can listen to them over, and over, and over!There are a bunch of great upbeat songs like &quot;Objection&quot;, &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;, &quot;Te Vejo <BR>Madrid&quot;. Even though I don't speak Spanish, I have managed to memorize almost all of the words to  &quot;Te Vejo Madrid&quot;! It's my favorite song on the album because of the way it makes me want to get up and dance everytime I hear it. I highly reccomend &quot;Laundry Service&quot; to you because of the way that every song is so fabulous. Some make you dance,and some mught even make you cry...
B00004XMS0|2.0|One of the greatest tragedies on film is the Batman series; not the story, but the movies themselves. If you must see one, you may be somewhat satasfied by the first. If you see two, you might want to check out Batman Returns. It's okay, but not nearly as good as the first. Batman Forever features Val Kilmer, whom I consider to be THE BEST batman, so you may want to see that film for his performance (be warned though, the film is a STINKER! And, Val Kilmer's performance is hampered by poor dialouge and the cheap Micheal Keaton impersonation that was forced on him). As for Batman and Robin, STAY AWAY FROM IT! ... I find almost all of the villains to be 99.9 % innacurate to their comic book and cartoon show counterparts. And, why the heck do they have to team up the villains, and why in such stupid pairs? The Penguin and Catwoman? Two-Face and the Riddler? MR. FREEZE AND POISON IVY? You get my drift. If you see one, just see the original. It's decent (but there are some odd casting choices, and somewhat shallow story). If you see two, see Batman Returns, however Danny Elfman's score isn't as good, and there are some annoying story decsisions. However, if you want REALLY good batman movies, I suggest the three excellent animated Batman attempts: Mask of the Phantastm, Sub Zero, and Return of the Joker. Each one chronicles a different batman era: When he was a loner, when there was a team, and when he trains the new Batman.<br />If you're looking for a top notch live action film though, I'm afraid you'll have to wait for Batman: Year One. ...
B00000K29E|3.0|Don't expect Big Brother's acid-rock roar. This is completely unlike their classic Cheap Thrills, with a much thinner sound but still an interesting mixture of blues, folk-rock, and psychedelic rock. I like Janis' vocals on Call On Me although she doesn't sound quite as desperate as usual; my other favorites include the bluesy, droning \\"All Is Loneliness\\" where Joplin sounds like nowhere else (but it's too short!), and \\"Women Is Losers\\" where she demonstrates the seeds of her genius that would fully flower on albums like Kozmic Blues and Pearl.  It's a solid rock album, but not as memorable as \\"Cheap Thrills.\\" I think the band were still finding their feet here. Only for Joplin/Big Brother completists.
B00005S8FC|5.0|In Argentina (and else where), there is always a debate on whether a new composition should be considered tango.  Many of the songs from \\"the Golden Age of Tango\\" created their own shares of controversy when they first came out in the first half of the 20th century.  Of course, then there was Astor Piazzolla, whose music to this day still manages to upset certain self-proclaimed purists.  <br />The Gotan Project attempts to amalgamate tango with other contemporary musical elements.  There were negative reviews, both on and off lines, that claimed that it was sacrilegious and ultimately not tango.  I would like these people to listen again carefully, because I could point to segments where the reference to classic tango is very obvious.<br />For example, on track 5 (\\"Santa Maria\\"), if you pay close attention and use a little imagination, the opening sounds just like \\"La Yumba\\" by Osvaldo Pugliese (more similar to the 1952 version; the 1946 version sounds too weak in most recordings.)   And on track 6 (Una Musica Brutal), part of the rubato from the middle section came almost directly from \\"Quejas de bandoneon\\" by Anibal Troilo.  <br />And the last track \\"vuelvo al sur\\" was truly interesting.  Most of us in the tango world are probably familiar with the version sung by Roberto Goyeneche (from the 1987? film \\"Sur\\").  His scratchy voice in conjunction with Piazzolla's bandoneon made this song one of the darkest, heaviest, and the most haunting tangos I know of.   The Gotan Project version is not as dense, but the contemporary rhythms seem to add an urban destitute and desolateness that are ironically appropriate, considering the current situation in Buenos Aires.  <br />Some of the other original compositions are very interesting too.  Overall, most of the tracks carry the quintessential \\"tango feeling\\" that connects this album to the century-old lineage of tango music.  I applaud them for their courage to bring in new elements to tango.  I think there is a fundamentalquestion for tango music aficionados today:  there are many excellent tango music groups that imitate the styles of the classic \\"orquestas tipicas\\".  The most popular subjects of imitation are Osvaldo Pugliese, Juan D'arienzo, and Carlos Di Sarli.  These three orchestras produced more than 1,000 recordings, many of which are considered \\"Gold Standards\\" for the particular songs.  Do we still want some \\"new\\" recordings that may sound like an cheap imitation to the Gold Standards?  When we buy a new tango CD next time, do we still want yet another rendition of \\"La cumparsita\\" or \\"El choclo\\"?  <br />I am writing here as someone who had fallen in love with tango from the Golden Age and had spent quite a bit of time reading about it and listening to endless hours of Pugliese and Troilo. Here in New York, we are fortunate enough to have two regular tango groups that perform in milongas and I adore both of them dearly.  I love the tango from the 1940s and 50s but from I learn from its history, it is vital for tango to renovate itself every generation to sustain its existence 50 years after its Golden Age.  Whether you like the music or not, I believe that the Gotan Project had at least made that courageous attempt.
0312265859|3.0|\\"Hard Eight\\" was fine.  It wasnt the greatest, as a matter of fact, it was my LEAST favorite of the series.  I agree with the reviewer who said that she wanted more Ranger and Joe and less Valerie and her kids.  I truly enjoy all the shenanigans of Grandma Mazur...and even she was missing through most of the book.  I didn't find myself laughing aloud quite as much as I'd have liked to.  I think Janet should incorporate more of Steph's romantic life in her next book and kill off all bears, rabbits, etc.
6304696566|5.0|The photography is breathtaking at times, and the movie itself, emotionally powerful -- regardless of your feelings towards the film's attitude towards Native Americans.  The number of divergent reviews suggest that Ford intended John Wayne to be read simultaneously as the monomaniacal racist mindlessly shooting buffalo in order that the \\"Commanche\\" not have a source of food for the winter, and as towering figure who relentlessly searches (hunts?) for his niece. In either case, Ethan is the exceptional figure who never quite fits in civilized society. Ford's brilliance was to dramatize the ambiguity with which we view such characters, at once a threat to the order of things and its savior. As for the film's treatment of Native Americans, I think that it stretches one's credulity to claim that their treatment was \\"realistic\\" and devoid of racist stereotypes. What is true, though, is that Ford quite consciously calls into question the validity of the stereotypes used in the genre. Which is to say, that while the movie is not free of some disturbing representations, it certainly recognizes the injustice of some of the representations. This recognition of sorts, coupled with the complexity of Ethan's character (I've always wondered how aware Wayne was of the \\"dark side\\" of Ethan), is why I consider it to be Ford's greatest work (certainly a debatable claim).
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie is a must have for anyone who is a fan of war or military based movies.  Black Hawk Down is a type of movie where you will be speechless at the end.  I am currently reading the book by Mark Bowden and am realizing that parts of the movie are not 100% accurate.  However, there is nothing in this movie that could not have happened.  The film will leave you angry, frustrated, and a give you new appreciation of what the people of the United States Military are about.  In my opinion, to get the most out of the movie, you need to read the book and see the special that was broadcast by the History Channel, &quot;The True Story of Black Hawk Down&quot;.  These two additional mediums will help you to begin to understand the true meaning of &quot;Leave No Man Behind&quot;.
6305882592|5.0|Harold and Maude is a very moral story.  The audience is asked to analyze what is important to them, and to ignore restrictions that were made by irrelevant powers.  It supports the idea of an inner law.  People determine the rules for themselves, not a society.  It is not a story about death, but truly about living.  Harold and Maude's fascination with death is not reminscent of the Addams Family, at all.  Maude has a fascination with death because she loves every part of life and the cycle.  Harold is interested more because he is still trying to find who he is, and what is important to him.  Noone should waste their lives, and Ashby does a wonderful job of showing that.  We all need to appreciate what we have, while we fight for what we think is right. We should also always act in a way that we believe is moral, this is different for everyone.  This film helps viewers analyze what they should be focusing on in their own lives.  It also helps to shatter notions of how things should be.  Harold and Maude is a fantastic film that is funny, touching, intelligent, and has a lot to say.  This is a movie everyone should see.
B0000549B2|5.0|Mo Better is Mo Better! Everything is in this story.  I love Spike's take on relationship in this movie.  Any jazz lover will love this movie.  A must for all Spike fans.
0792839730|3.0|A Bridge too Far isn't as effective an anti-war film as, say, Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down, but it is an interesting film in its own right.  The actual planning and strategizing is compelling, and Richard Attenborough stages a lot (and I do mean a LOT) of exciting action sequences, but in between these moments, the film almost becomes a mess.  The cast is too large to keep track of, the dialogue is a little goofy, and the film never does attain the same chilling violence that SPR and BHD displayed.  Still, slightly recommended for war film fans.
B000067CPX|5.0|I've always liked and respected this band more than I've liked their music. Every once in awhile they had a song that really caught my attention, such as, &quot;Breaking The Girl&quot;. As soon as I heard &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; from &quot;Californication&quot; I knew something had changed and it was the first RHCP c.d. I purchased. That c.d. was a HUGE step forward for this band; not as musicians-They are all excellent-but, as songwriters. Nothing could have prepared me for the new c.d. As soon as I heard &quot;By the Way&quot; on VH1 yesterday I went out and bought the c.d. This c.d. puts the most recent U2 and R.E.M. discs to shame. There is not a bad song, but the disc would have more impact if it was a little shorter. The harmonies are amazing, the guitar playing is brilliant and every song is a journey that rarely ends even close to where it started. There are unexpected keyboard lines and stunning guitar solos scattered throughout these songs. I am so happy for them to have survived all they've been through and have the peace of mind to make wonderful music.
0316666343|4.0|This book's unusual premise gives one pause to consider deeply how humans are affected by death, both here and on the \\"other side\\".  If you are looking for a fantasy about what life after death is, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for a whodunit, this is not your book.  This book requires the reader to become more involved in the often overlooked and deeper result of the losses that those who are merely vouyers of crime seldom experience.  The author challenges you by stretching your thinking past the obviouis criminology or emotional pain caused by a horrid act of violence.  Having the victim tell the story herself is the key.  So, no matter what your beliefs are about crime and life after death, I guarantee you'll find something within these pages that you hadn't thought of before.
B000002A46|5.0|Wow!<BR>It was really fast and GREAT condition!<BR>I'm really satisfied with my purchase!<BR>The seller's doing truly GOOD job!<BR>Once you buy through this seller, you'll never regret!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I have to say that honestly - I wasn't all that excited about this movie.  I love musicals (especially Les Miserables), but it was advertized somewhat poorly and I thought it looked almost hokey.  Not to mention how sick I was of hearing Lady Marmalade every 3 seconds on the radio.  I thought the movie seemed not worth my time, and that I wouldn't like it anyway.<br />How incredibly wrong I was.<br />This more is so unique and has so much character, it blows you away.  Whether you enjoy musicals or not, this movie is amazing for so many different reasons - the acting, the cast, the sets, the costumes...and of course, the songs!  It's nothing that you could expect or imagine, because it's in a genre all its own.  It fits so many different categories, but not just one - a drama, a comedy, a musicial, a farce - a love story.  It's a movie that definitely reaches people on all levels, as long as its given a chance.<br />This is one film that is definitey not a waste of your time.  It will leave you breathless and drunk with emotion.  If only there were more than 5 stars...
B000002J1Y|2.0|&quot;Yessongs&quot;, the 3 album live recording released in 1973 ranks up there with some of the best live rock'n roll ever to be released on vinyl.  It definitely characterized a magical period when the band had released &quot;The Yes Album&quot;, &quot;Fragile&quot; and &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; in just over a year.  <br />I grew up during this period and was amazed by the complexity and artistry that Yes achieved in integrating classical and jazz influences into rock music.  I was a fan then and I am a fan now... However, I was stunned when I recently picked up a new remastered copy of &quot;Yessongs&quot; to prep for seeing the band in concert in a couple of weeks.  The production quality of the CD absolutely stinks.  On the cover of the CD case it mentions that it was digitally remastered by Ocean View Digital.  Well, shame on Ocean View and Atlantic Recording Corporation for re-releasing this inferior product on an unsuspecting public. <br />When I first inserted the CD into my player, I couldn't believe my ears. I proceeded to demo one of my favorite tunes, &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot; by switching back and forth between the live version in the 4 CD box set with the one on Yessongs.  Shouldn't I be able to expect similar quality?  Perhaps, I am not being fair if the version in the box set was a more updated recording, but it wasn't even close as far as I am concerned.  The high notes screeched through my speakers (yes, I own a decent system)and there was very little stereo separation--a mish-mash of sound.  Unfortunately, this was typical for the entire CD. I certainly wasn't listening to a soundstage which I would have expected from a remastered copy of this great recording.<br />It's tough to rate this CD/original recording any less than a five, but Ocean View Digital found a way to destroy it.  Hence, it rates a two.
B000067G3C|5.0|There's not much I can say about this, except that an updated DVD release is long overdue.  I'm sure that literally EVERY single person in the USA has seen it in one form or the other, and that everyone liked it.
B000009HF2|5.0|This album contains inspired tunes played in one of the best live performances ever. If you've never heard this album from beginning to end you may think you can sum it up with \\"Baby I Love Your Way\\" and \\"Do You Feel Like We Do?\\" but you would be wrong. This album is pure magic all the way through. The best way to describe it is \\"laid back rock n roll\\", mellow songs that still manage to jam. There are also a few of the best acoustic numbers on this album. The lead guitar work is some of the most stunning ever captured on a live album and Frampton's voice is flawless. This album is the reason everyone makes such a fuss about the live sound, when it is done right it delivers something a studio album cannot. Also,the recording is done perfectly so every instrument is heard clearly. Frampton Comes Alive is a must if you are looking for a classic live album.
B00005RY7X|4.0|Okay, I don't know if I really do 'get' this album, but it has grown on me...hard.  Other's comparisons of W.K. to 80's hair metal bands seems appropriate, but also misleading.  While W.K. no doubt listened to AC/DC, Van Halen, and other bands I am really too young to know about when he was a teenager, I don't think he shares the exact same attitude with them.  Where these bands really were hedonistic and essentially brainless except when worried about seeming sensitive, W.K. is hedonistic because of a confused, compounded frustration and dissatisfaction, instead of just adolescent rebelliousness.  I think if it was as simplistic a record as many say it is, so many wouldn't be so thrown by it.  W.K. IS slamming the metal crowd, but also seems to realize his own predisposition towards ... aggression, and combines his resentment and intelligence with his hormonal impulsiveness into a nice mix of self-hatred and self-righteousness.  It makes sense to me... if Andrew W.K. was really just a testosterone-spitting, groupie-balling bad boy, would he really interest people who listen to Wilco?  Or promote Britney Spears, N'Sync, and Marilyn Manson in the same sentence without a hint of irony during interviews?  Andrew seems to really understand the appeal of excess as opposed to just the inane self-indulgence of other rockers, and I appreciate him creating his own popcore niche and for catering to those who believe in bad taste and overdoing everything for the sake of your own discomfort.  Cheerleaders and Frat boys?  I just don't think they'd understand.
B000067CPX|5.0|this is one of the greatest american pop-rock-alternative album of the year. don't miss it at any cost. they play sad kind of sound but full of joyness inside also. no wonder why flea called john the greatest musician in the world. of cause he deserved that. i believe you will like it even though you like weezer, ween ,blur or even sonic youth. john played guitar and keyboard also in this album. many kind of music genre added to this record and sound. who want to miss this stuff anyway, hur? i won't for sure. <br />this album is bigger than californication ... about 10 times.<BR>:)
B000067CPX|3.0|The new RHCP album,By The Way, has some ok songs. Most of them are slow softer tracks. I think their best album was Freaky Style. The track \\"On Mercury\\" reminded me of that album, which was good. Standout tracks are<br />Tear<BR>Cabron-Nice latin feel<BR>On Mecury-Freaky Styley<BR>By The Way-think youve heard this..<br />Overall, its a good album to chill to, but its not RHCPS's best work. Check out Freaky Styley.

B000059HCN|5.0|A Requiem for A Dream is clearly a beautiful disturbing masterpiece. The movie is divided into the seasons of summer, fall and winter. And as the seasons of nature get darker and colder through the seasons, a requiem for a dream does as well. The film is Darren's Aronofsky's portrayal of the consequences of abusing substances for greed, profit, or self improvement. Each character in the film begin with loads of ambition and through substances these ambitions turn dark and slim to hopelessness. Although the film has high amounts of drug content and some explicit sex, they prove to be essential to the movie's message and storyline. The film includes superb acting and oustanding directing and it should not be missed.
0553288105|4.0|There are many topics present in THE GODS THEMSELVES that will be familiar to anyone who has read a good number of the late, great Isaac Asimov's work.  Back-stabbing in the academic world, scientific progress, human folly, fear of outsiders and other themes can be found, not only here, but in countless other short stories and novels written by the good doctor.  Using his accustomed pieces as a springboard, Asimov created in this book an almost epic tale of human hubris as it tries to take advantage of a science that it doesn't even understand.  Despite having a few minor misgivings with the conclusion, I felt that this ranked right up there with the best of his stories.<br />The book is divided into three sections, each telling part of the tale, and each featuring its own cast of characters.  Asimov was clever enough to weave the story carefully so that we get the various portions from three different points of view (this is even cleverer in the middle section but you'll have to read it to find out how).  The themes and tones established at the beginning manage to thread their way through effortlessly, which is quite an achievement given how wildly different the three sections are in terms of setting, characters, and motivations.<br />The middle section of the three could almost be left on the cutting room floor as far as the rest of the plot is concerned.  There is virtually nothing here that isn't revealed or repeated in the other two sections.  But it is this alien-centric passage that makes this book the classic that it is today.  Aliens in science-fiction stories can generally fall into two main categories.  In the first, there are the aliens who look, act and sound exactly like human beings, with the only real difference being that they have pieces of plastic on their foreheads, or can see in the dark, or something else trivial like that.  They don't really have dissimilar minds to humans; they don't think differently.  The second group is the race of creatures of which every individual member is just like every other (watch any episode of Star Trek to see the war-like aliens, or the peace-loving aliens, or the scientific aliens, etc.).  Yet, Asimov managed to do something really special here.  He created a race of beings that are certainly much different from what we would describe as human, but he also made them into interesting individuals.  A triple-gendered species is a difficult concept to develop (especially in novel form), but Asimov did a terrific job here at describing the genders in terms of general archetypes, and then making the individuals interesting in their own right, regardless of their alienness.  <br />One of the only things that I didn't think lived up to the quality of the rest was the ease of the resolution.  It's a bit too simple and slightly too neat.  The conclusion makes logical and scientific sense, but one doesn't get the impression of any real emotion.  It's as if the main characters can really be bothered to get excited over the impending destruction of the solar system.  There's also a subplot that only really gets going very near to the end causing it to appear to have come out of nowhere.  These aren't really major flaws, but they do cause a little but of a comedown after the wonder on display in the first two sections.  It felt a bit as though Asimov had really let himself go wild in the beginning and middle parts, and then forced himself to reign in his story by the end.  A little disappointing, but this is still quite a captivating ride.<br />Like many of Asimov's novels, this is a great book for fans of science fiction or for newcomers to the genre.  There's a little bit of High School physics on display, but don't let that intimidate you, as Asimov's deceptively simple writing style is what made him such a great teacher of all things scientific.  If you've never had the pleasure of reading any of this author's work before, then THE GODS THEMSELVES would be a great place to start.Several of Asimov's favorite subjects are offered here, and this will give you a great overview of his style of storytelling.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I've had this CD for a couple of months and I just need to say to anyone who is thinking about buying this CD and is being influenced by negative reviews -- don't be! There is absolutely no reason to negatively criticize this. John Mayer is a beginning recording artist who is expressing himself, how can anyone criticize that! His writing is very enjoyable and done with skill. The songs become catchier everytime you listen to them. His voice's timbre is very unique and like nothing you've most likely heard. I LOVE this CD. But again, my biggest liking to this album is the writing -- just wonderful!<br />Try it, buy the CD. Here in Baltimore, his concert sold out fast. The Grammy for best new artist will probably be given to someone who's been getting more exposure with the teens and MTV -- but John deserves it! <br />Favorites on this disc include: No Such Thing, City Love, 83, Love Song For No One, and Back to You.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|I have never written a review on here before but I knew that I had to after I got this CD.  I originally bought the CD because I heard \\"La Cienega Just Smiled\\" and \\"Harder Now That It's Over\\" on the TV show Felicity.  Then I kept hearing a lot about Ryan Adams so I decided to go out and buy the album.  I am soo glad that I did!!! It is always in my CD player and there are songs on this album to fit any kind of mood that I am in.  There is something unique and enchanting about each and every song.  The lyrics are so thought provoking and refreshing.  I love all the songs but my favorites are \\"New York, New York\\", \\"La Cienega Just Smiled\\", \\"Answering Bell\\", \\"Rescue Blues\\" and \\"Harder Now That It's Over.\\"  I honestly recommend this album to everyone!!  I think Ryan Adams is incredibly talented and I can't wait until his next album comes out!!!
B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco gets better with every album they release.  This release is no exception.  Wondrous, rich, and strange...  Beautifully textured songs, lyrically brilliant.  Why read this when you can listen to the album and judge for yourself?
6302968143|5.0|Surprisingly this movie did terrible in the theatres, but it really does make an excellent television movie.  The three witches were hilarious and very excitingly troublesome, as they seek revenge 300 years after their hanging after being resurrected.  This is a wonderful halloween movie... may scare some of the very young kids... not my mischevious little girls, but parents may want to watch it first to see if it's not too much for their little ones.  There are a few parts that I think are questionable.  However, this may be the reason this movie bombed out, as 90% of it is more interesting for the very young kids... then the other 10% is a little too much (or too scary) for them.  I would recommend parents to watch first, may be better for about 8 yrs and up... but may seem to childish to them.
B00005MAM2|5.0|This is a great movie, one that really makes you think.  If you really pay attention to details, something clicks in your mind at the end of the movie that says, &quot;AHA! I get it now!&quot; and then moments later, &quot;Or do I?&quot;  It is has a good plot with strong philosophical overtones that really come through if you pay attention to the details.  If you like action, this is a safe bet.  If you like Sci-Fi, this is a safe bet.  However the movie's strength comes in its well developed, intriguing plot and in its ability to really make you think.<br />Although I don't own the DVD myself, I have seen the new dub and it is much better than the old one, it clears up so many questions I had about the plot, and those lines that just sounded really awkward aren't there (Anyone remember Tetsuo saying something along the lines of, &quot;want to turn me into a humanoid like the others&quot;? and Tetsuo IS human, by the way).  And overall the new dub made sense, so it didn't just leave me dumbfounded at the end like the older dub did.  I haven't watched any subtitled versions, though.
1577311523|5.0|Two books have been highly recommended to me in the past year.  One was the Power of Now.

In this book the author presents usuable techniques for staying in the now.  A winning combination--Power of Now, with Present Moment Awareness.  The combination has increased the quality of my life.  Cathy Bolger

B000005RXH|3.0|Supertramp's second album (no longer available in the US) has pieces of the band's classic sound scattered throughout the album. The songs showcase influences of Traffic, Yes and Blind Faith. Although it lacks the originality seen with later albums, the songwriting is quite solid and the performances excellent throughout the recording.<br />The generic sound surprisingly sustains the album on many of the weaker tracks. Although the songs lack the personality of later Davies-Hodgson songs, they lend themselves well to the extended soloing found throughout the record. Even at this stage, the Davies sung pieces exhibit a strong flavor of r&amp;b while the Hodgson sung pieces are more pop sounding.<br />This probably isn't the album to get your feet wet with Supertramp if you don't have many of the band's albums. I'd recommend Crime of the Century, Breakfast in America, Even in the Quietest Moments and Crisis? What Crisis? before purchasing this album.
6305909326|5.0|I really do think that while this movie is not Roman Polanski's best films, it certainly is his most beautifully made. I think he really has a keener eye these days.<br />Johnny Depp gives his usual dark intensive performance.  If he smokes as much in real life as in this movie, he should be dead from lung cancer within five years.  There is something extremely sexy about this character.  His character is believable as one could be as a book collector/dealer, that does not mind having very little scruples.<br />Who here would not suspect Frank Langella as an avid book collector \\"only wanting Depp's character to compare pictures from three volumes of the same satanic book\\"?<br />I enjoyed the comparisons in the mysteries of the three books, as well as finding the \\"girl\\" intriguing.  I also admit that the deaths of three collectors of the same devilish book, to be extremely comical.  The look on the face of the strangled wheelchair bound collector brought some humor to a very dark suspensful story.<br />I enjoyed every moment of this movie, mostly because I like movies that delve into the dark closets of the mind.  I did find that the ending left me thinking I had missed something.  So I watched it again, and nope, I didn't miss a thing.  I then created in my own mind, what I thought it all meant.<br />Watch the movie and enjoy being totally confused.  I loved Johnny Depp and all of his steps in becoming \\"all knowing\\".
B000007491|3.0|Don't let the horrible cover fool you. There's quality music hidden beneath the picture on this fine debut album. What a difference a couple of years makes! Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson would remain the only hold overs from the first album on later Supertramp classics. Interestingly, later King Crimson lyricist Richard Palmer-James (called just Richard Palmer here)was an early part of the line up and receives 1/3 of the songwriting credit on all 10 compositions.<br /><br />The best comparison I can think of is early Yes with a hint of Steve Winwood's Traffic thrown in. The songs meander all over the stylistic map with Maybe I'm a Begger and Surely the most closely related to the later Supertramp sound. The songs have all the right ingredients for the later, more commerically polished prog pop sound but they clearly haven't been cooked long enough for the right flavor.<br /><br />Hodgson handles the bulk of the lead vocals on the debut and he does so quite well. The bluesier elements that distinguish the Davies sung pieces hasn't quite emerged yet with the sound firmly planted in the \\"classic\\" prog sound of the early 70's.<br /><br />The sound quality of these 90's remasters is good if a bit harsh compared to other editions. There aren't any bonus tracks nor are there any alternate takes or notes in the booklets. That's a pity as it would be nice to give the fans something new.<br /><br />While not quite as stunning as the later material that the Davies & Hodgson team would later write, SUPERTRAMP has a number of powerful moments. Listening to their debut and second album reminds me of watching a friend growing up; you can see all of the essentials that make up the person but they haven't converged in a way that reveals the true, quirky personality that you've grown to love over time.
B00003CXI1|2.0|As stated, the book is outstanding.  However, the movie falls far short of the high standards of it's namesake.  Instead of trying to create a movie, the director devided instead to try to film the book.  The result is a movie that is very choppy, akward, and in some places seems altogether too long.<br />Had the filmmakers attmepted to pull the main story elements from the book and create a movie surrounding them, this could have been one of the best movies of the year.  Instead this movie can be hard to follow for those who've not read the book (although, by this point who hasn't read the book?).<br />Watching this movie for the first time was an interesting experience.  Watching it for the second time almost put me to sleep.  This movie is great for kids and for huge fans of teh books, but it won't be gracing my collection.
0783229526|2.0|Well what can I say? I expected a lot out of this movie, especially when two of my favorite actors Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro are tag-teamed here. Unfourtantley, the movie couldn't deliver the goods. I am not very familiar with Hunter S. Thompson and thus I haven't read his book but it didn't stop me from watching this movie. Ohh what a movie and how long this movie dragged on and on. The movie hooked me in the beginning with Johnny Depp's &quot;This is bat country&quot; quote but it laggs from there. There is not much humor left in the movie. It almost seems that Terry Gillian expects you to have a stoner mentality or just be plain stoned to enjoy this movie, but I didn't. It was hard to sit through this.<br />The reason I give this movie 2 stars is simply because of Johnny Depp's wicked performance. He truly is a great mimick actor whether he is playing Joe Pistone(Donnie Brasco), George Jung(Blow) or Ed Wood(Ed Wood) this guy can imitate real-life figures so well it's scary. But the performance is not enough to save this mess of a movie. Now for Benicio, well his performance wasn't as good. Benny, Benny, Benny when are you going to learn that you should invest your acting talents in more respectable movies like &quot;Traffic&quot;. Though it's admirable that he gained weight to play the role his character leaves much to be desired. What's worse all these guest apperances Toby Mcguire, Cameron Diaz, and Ellen Burkin(All fine actors in their own right) come out as farces. They do little or nothing to help this lagging script thus wasting their talents. I don't know maybe the script writer hung out with Thompson in his resort and was taking his own voyage in Gonzo journalism 420 style.
B000000WA4|5.0|I've had this album for quite a while and it still amazes me every time I listen to it.  Billy Corgan's vocals may be difficult to get used to at first, but after a few listens you'll start to love his voice.  The songs are all perfectly arranged, and have beautiful lyrics.  And all of the members of this band are so talented.  Billy and James guitar, D'Arcy's bass, and Jimmy's machine-gun-like drum work all stand out on this album.  Some songs on this are angry and loud, others are soft and mellow, and others are sweeping and pop-like.  I don't see how anyone could dislike this CD.
B000067CPX|5.0|When I first put in this disc I was a bit skeptical if they could top 1999's Californication. At first listen this Album sounded odd and I didnt know what to think. That was short lasted soon Anthony Keidas's odd but poetic lyrics got stuck in my head with each listen. <BR>Even better this isnt a copy of Californication which Is what i was expecting, but instead the take a step in a diffrent direction. This album for the most part stays mellow leaving the funk to a minimal. <BR>This album is one of my fav RHCP albums even though Keidas doesnt do any of his classic rapping
B00005ATZT|5.0|The other really awesome action film of 1993 held its own against JURASSIC PARK to not only become a big box-office hit but go so far as to be Oscar-worthy. We all know the Academy is just a bunch of stuffy cronies who hate action films, so it's VERY surprising (and refreshing) to think that THE FUGITIVE was nominated for Best Film! Harrison Ford is his usual commanding self as Dr. Richard Kimble, a man who we all know is wrongly acccused for the muder of his wife. Tommy Lee Jones, who won the Best Supporting Actor Award, is at his best as the cop trying to hunt Kimble down. Director Andrew Davis' approach to the material is superbly- crafted, with some incredible action set-pieces along the way. Jones reprised his role in U.S. MARSHALS, but the original is the best. One of the greatest action films of the 90s. The extras on the DVD are a great improvement from the original release, with a commentary from Davis and Jones (sadly, Ford is missing), two featurettes, trailers and more.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is one of those films that's too &quot;out there&quot; for the Hollywood crowd, who call it abstract, artsy-fartsy, and so on; at the same time, film school students will find it very Hollywood nonetheless -- it's no Fellini flick, and everything here has been done before.<br />That said, Memento takes a couple of basic film techniques and really runs a clinic -- what it does, it does really well, and the performances of the stellar cast are nuanced, memorable, and overall quite excellent.<br />Film school students: let your hair down and enjoy this one, it's actually very entertaining, very accessible, and at the same time difficult enough that you can admit you liked it. Hollywood buffs: just once, pay close attention to a film -- don't talk, don't get up for food or a bathroom-run, just leave the noggin' on while you watch; it's a great little film, and it may even make you feel like you understand film students better than you did before!
B000002GYI|5.0|When I first bought this CD, I was unsure about what I'd think of it. No longer. This is my favorite CD. And I'm counting my entire collection. It's also my favorite Kraftwerk CD. From the first track, &quot;Computer World&quot;, to the Last, &quot;It's More Fun To Compute&quot;, Kraftwerk shows why it's on the list of the biggest musical influences. If you listen to this CD for more than 5 seconds, you'll realize where the hip-hop sounds came from. The samples and organisation of them on this CD make a strong statement to the viability of Kraftwerk's entire discography. The lyrics are prophetic. Computer World (the title track) gives the impression of a computer-control society. That which we have now. &quot;Business, Numbers, Money, People&quot;. Think about it. The priorities of buisness. Numbers before Money: Bad Accoutning Practicies. Money Before People: While evident throughout history, it represent's business caring more of money than people. Then, there are the fun tracks, like &quot;Pocket Calculator&quot;. I'm listening to that song now. It's on my top 10 favorite songs list. &quot;By Pressing Down A Special Key it plays a little melody&quot;. Get this CD. You will not regret it.
B000002UAU|5.0|This is the first Beatles album I owned, so my attitudes to it are coloured by that. Aside from the great music, the album had the most interesting packaging. It is terrific that when the CD was released in 1987, 20 years after the original outing, it was also packaged in an interesting manner, with excellent notes about the music and the cover included in the booklet.<br />It is a great shame that the other CDs were so miserably packaged.<br />The recording features a lot of other players and instruments besides The Beatles, including horns on the title track, weird-sounding harpsichord in Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, another string group, this time with harp, too, on She's Leaving Home, old-fashioned steam organs on Being For the Benefit of Mr Kite, a full Indian ensemble, but with orchestral strings as well on Within You, Without You, clarinets and tubular bell on When I'm 64, the saxophones, trumpets and trombones of Sounds Incorporated on Good Morning, Good Morning and then a full orchestra playing atonal, aleatoric crescendos on A Day in the Life.<br />The album features quite simple songs like With A Little Help From My Friends to songs with strange rhythms and keys like Within You, Without You and Good Morning, Good Morning.<br />It is a great album, but I think you have to be in the mood for it, whereas Rubber Soul always sounds fine.<br />It is only really a concept album in a loose sense, because the idea of it being a concert by Sgt Pepper's band is really only evident in the first two tracks, where the band is introduced and Sgt Pepper introduces Billy Shears, Billy [Ringo] singing With A Little Help From My Friends.<br />Then you have several songs not related to this theme at all, but after Within You, Without You the crowd laughs and reminds you that this is supposed to be a concert. Before the last song, Sgt Pepper's theme tune is reprised and we are thanked for being such a great audience. But this seems to be enough to hold the album together.<br />McCartney's great bass playing really shines on this album. It is so often melodic and interesting. When I first got the album, I sometimes listened to the album, focussing on the bass part.<br />Every song is interesting, and each has its own unique sound. Even the guitars and voices have been given a different sound for each song.<br />I still enjoy listening after 35 years.<br />Highly recommended.<br />McCartney's great bass playing really shines on this album.

B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is a great writer. She knows what teenagers go through and people can relate to her much better. She should be on top. Hit number 1!
B00006ADFL|5.0|I'm really at a loss for words as to how to start this review. I saw it for the first time a few months and it has come up in my thoughts probably once a day. I can say that Peter Jackson's direction was plainly brilliant, surreal and poetic in a way that Lord of the Rings was not. I can say that Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet turn in remarkable performances, generating more screen charisma than maybe any other duo in recent film, rivaled only by The Silence of the Lambs and Titanic. It is funny because it is true, odd because it is real, and tragic because we know it didn't have to happen.
B000050XEI|1.0|This stuff doesn't belong in music stores. It belongs in the presecription medicine aisle of your local chemists or 'drug store' - under 'Sleep Aids'. But it must stay as prescription only. If too many people start playing this during daylight hours, entire city blocks could be sent to sleep, with catastrophic results. Drivers would zonk out at the wheel, nuclear power workers would doze through developing meltdowns, office workers would fall asleep and fail to do any meaningful work all day - okay, that last one's pretty much normal. But you see what I mean. Side effects of chronic uncoolness and middle-agedness also need to be worried about.
6305165912|5.0|This is my favorite Coen brothers movie, closely followed by Raising Arizona.  John Goodman is hilarious as a Vietnam Vet who takes his bowling very serious and doesn't roll<BR>on sundays.  Shomer Shabbat!<BR>The highlights of the movie for me are the parts with Jesus.  Not the messiah, but the bowler.  The part where he's shining his bowling ball makes me die laughing every time.  <BR>\\"You said it man.  Nobody f's with the Jesus.\\"
B000067CPX|5.0|This CD was such a pleasant surprise. Songwriting and harmonies are great. Listen to &quot;Warm Tape&quot; - psychadelic and intoxicating.
6301934229|2.0|I want to know what movie they were watching, beacuse this is not that great a film. Some suspense, a lot of bad acting, and way too many scenes when you say out loud &quot;OH, come on&quot;, like falling out of a moving car at 60 MPH and then getting up without a scratch. This movie, it's just OKAY. RENT IT!
B000066NW0|5.0|Hey Guys~<BR> I bought &quot;Let Go&quot; by Avril Lavigne the first day it came out and i luv it!! It rocks!!  I listen to it 24-7 and can never get enough of it.. the best part is, you know how on almost every cd theres at least one song you skip over.. well not on &quot;Let Go&quot; EVERY song is great!! You will also relate to a lot of them!! I recomend this CD to ANYONE, so go out there and buy it NOW!! =)
B00003CWL6|1.0|\\"American Beauty\\" opens and closes with Kevin Spacey's narration from the grave, an idea lifted from Billy Wilder's 1950 masterpiece \\"Sunset Boulevard.\\" Similarities end there: The caustic and brilliant cynicism of Wilder and Charles Brackett's last screenplay together has been replaced by Alan Ball's *pose* of same. When it came out, there was a lot of talk about how \\"courageous\\" this movie's producers were. I saw no courage in it; merely a clichéd portrait of suburbia.<br />Suburbia as a soul-draining no man's land is nothing new in Hollywood. \\"The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit,\\" (1955) explored similar themes, and Gregory Peck even shared the same (by now hackneyed) profession -- advertising man -- as Kevin Spacey's anti-hero, Lester. In the classic movie, Peck puts his job on the line to maintain his integrity, and wins. Spacey's \\"modernized\\" rat boosts his severance package by blackmailing his firm's \\"efficiency expert,\\" and then uses the proceeds to forever chuck his responsibilities.<br />Its premise, that Spacey has (unbeknownst to him) just a year to live shows him in the throes of a \\"mid-life crisis\\" in which we find him \\"living each day as if it were my last.\\" So, does he go and write the great American novel? Does he reinvigorate his neglected family life? No; he quits his dead-end job to work at a fast food joint (obviously, a much more self-fulfilling career), exercises, buys a red Firebird and lusts after his teenage daughter's best friend. Whereas Wilder and Brackett conjured memorable flesh-and-blood characters from the printed page, \\"Beauty\\" scenarist Ball has a reverse-alchemy going on: Despite lots of gratuitous flesh, the characters come off as two-dimensional cardboard cutouts.<br />There was a saying in the dramatic world, \\"the play's the thing.\\" Now, \\"the agenda's the thing.\\" All the characters in this movie aren't characters at all, but *representatives*, stand-ins for various social and political agendas. <br />\\"American Beauty\\" is marketedwith the slogan \\"Look Closer\\": \\"Look closer,\\" you'll see that the gay couple across the street is just like you and me; the \\"macho,\\" homophobic, Marine is really a repressed homosexual (who didn't see that coming a mile away?); the \\"weird\\" drug-dealing peeping-Tom is really a well of philosophical profundity, rivaling Gandhi in depth and Mother Teresa in altruistic impulse; the popular cheerleader is actually this shy, lonely virgin (yeah, right), and the chiseled-chin real estate guy is your typical Hollywood capitalist -- shallow, ruthless, a philanderer and (big surprise) a gun nut. No matter how much I \\"looked closer,\\" I couldn't see any real people, or even ideal people that used to populate Hollywood fare. Instead, I kept seeing this PC playbook, written by some narcissistic baby-boomer who demands people view his movie with an open mind, but who himself sees life with blinders on.<br />As character studies, Lester and his wife Carolyn (played by Annette Bening) ain't Joe Gillis and Norma Desmond. In \\"Sunset Boulevard,\\" William Holden and Gloria Swanson weren't exactly people you'd want in your living room, but you'd certainly go to the Bijou to study them night after night. Their disturbing relationship was larger-than-life human nature at its darkest and most melodramatic. With \\"American Beauty,\\" it's the people that have gotten small.<br />Occasionally, I actually sympathize with Lester, especially when he's being sarcastic to his wife. But all-in-all, the characterizations are just laughable at best: The scene in which Annette Bening becomes a \\"gun-nut\\" and goes to the range to work out her frustrations, she manages to get tight shot groups despite her rising arms, due to her twisted, manic, facial expression and breathing while shooting. It's a scene that could only have been written by an anti-gun activist with an axe to grind. Real people at firing ranges know they can't shoot well unless they're calm and collected.<br />But that would contradict the moviemakers' agenda. Likewise with the homosexual couple: They're merely props for Mendes and Balls politics; out of all the main characters in the movie, they have the least screen time (only about 2-3 minutes total), and are only in the script to represent \\"normality.\\" With all the talk the PC crowd devotes to the \\"trivialization\\" of marginalized peoples, you'd think someone would've complained about how trivial these gay characters were; aside from idly chatting with neighbors, delivering flowers to new arrivals on the block and jogging, the viewer knows nothing about them. But, since Jim and Jim weren't written to be interesting beyond their function as poster children, Ball and Mendes didn't see the necessity.<br />Ultimately, \\"look closer\\" is a great marketing tool, because upon looking closer, the viewer is left as bereft of any inspiration or entertainment as upon entering. That's how clever its producers are. This gimmick is a new spin on an old Grimm brothers fable, \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\": If YOU can't understand it, then it MUST be deep; if you don't agree with Mendes and Ball's worldview, then YOU must be a social regressive; if you don't think suburban life is as bad as they paint it, then YOU'RE not looking \\"closely\\" enough, and; if upon looking closer, you find it shallow and vapid, then YOU lack depth.<br />In reality, it's Ball and Mendes lack depth: You can't have you're cynical cake and eat your sugarcoated agenda, too. Proof lies in another movie from 1999, \\"Election,\\" by writer/director Alexander Payne, which explored identical themes as \\"American Beauty.\\" However, \\"Election\\" bristles with real cynicism, and Payne presents people like you've actually known in your lifetime, and actually gets to the heart of what motivates them in a panoply of human nature. Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon play *internally* motivated people, and thus came off as believable characters, complete in themselves; The cast of \\"American Beauty\\" were merely crude marionettes dancing on the strings manipulated by an all-thumbs screenwriter and director. <br />The fact that \\"Election\\" was not even nominated for any Oscars shows that members of the Academy \\"looked closer,\\" but obviously not at any other movies.
B000000H7I|5.0|Like I said this CD is super heavy. And the production, though not good, fits the music perfectly. This album is so good, and yeah, Pierced is better, but look at the release date on this thing!<BR>   It's kinda sad that Suffocation didn't get the attention they deserved, like Cannibal Corpse or Morbid Angel (good bands), because although this came out when death metal was the 'shiz', this crushed many fledging wannabes. This album takes the supreme elements of grindcore bands such as Cryptopsy and Origin, the strange time changes of Meshuggah, the heavieness of Hypocrisy, the technicality of Slayer and Morbid Angel, and mash it all together to make one big album.<BR>The Band:<BR>   Frank, vocals- At first glance, many people would think that this guy couldn't growl lower than Barnes, but looks can be decieving, indeed (and who gives about image anywho?). This guy has become one of my favorite vocalists. Frank is so freakin' harsh it hurts your throat, but not to the point you're about to throw up, like that dude from Pig Destroyer (good band, but it's hard to listen to that vocalist).<BR>   Terrance, guitar- One of the best guitarists to grace the death metal scene. I really wish it would show who did the solos. But by reading who wrote the songs, you can tell Hobbs is a master of death metal guitar. Urgh, it makes you so mad that they broke up, don't it?<BR>   Doug, guitar- The guitar duels that take place on this album are very cool. Those rhythm/lead switches, those odd timed scales, everything about these two guitarists will amaze you. Doug and Terrance, you shall be missed greatly.<BR>   Josh, bass- You know, I wish all death metal would go back to letting the bassist do something for a change, like what Josh shows off here and what Alex does with CC. Suffocation even lets Josh play some short solos in there! And even though the production is mediocre, the bass still adds that huge sound.<BR>   Mike, drums- Though his replacement probably does a better job, there's no denying this guy is GOOD. And, Mike isn't just full on blast beats through the whole album, and that's what makes him great. He can do those huge, long blast beats, but it seems like he's more interested in the double bass drums and rolls. A definate plus for Suffocation.<br />   I think for new fans of Suffocation that you should get this first, even if Pierced from Within is better. It'll propare you for the ride. This CD is an instant death metal CLASSIC, any aaalll death metal fans need to check it out.
B00004WGAA|5.0|Let me just say that &quot;Carinival Of Souls &quot; is the begining of what we see today in the theatre culture..I don't want to give away the ending but just watch the movie and you will understand what I'm trying to get at..&quot;Horror Hotel&quot; was another great movie..The acting other than Christopher Lee was so so, but put that aside and you have one heck of a horror film..I grew up watching The Friday The 13th's, Halloween's. and The Nightmare On Elm Street movies..A part of me wishes I grew up watching these kind of movies.Because after watching the scarier movies of today it's kind of hard to be afraid of the great classics of yesterday.
630587493X|5.0|By now you already know the plot of the movie, the question is: is it any good? Well I like most passed on this movie during its theatrical release, I don't know why, I just did. Fast forward 6 months after it's release on DVD, I'm at the video store with a long night ahead and nothing left in stock (New releases) So I pick up this film for some mild entertainment. <BR>Halfway through this movie I paused it and turned to my friend Michael (Another well read sci-fi fan) and I asked him <BR>&quot;Is it me or is this movie fantastic?&quot; We were both astonished by the emotional depth of the film. It is obvious why this was a theatrical bust; it was advertised as a comedy, which it most definitely not. Perhaps it is me, but this film really pressed at all of my buttons, granted as in any movie some scenes are stronger than others, but overall it ends up being an adult movie with a great story. A story of a robot seeking out his humanity, the Movie that A.I wanted to be, but wasn't. If you are a sci-fi fan get it. I ended up buying it after I rented it. If you enjoy it half as much as I did it will be worth it.
B000002R48|5.0|Sometimes I do think he's better than Kevin James LaBrie! They can both sing really well and sing extremely high notes. But Charlie has a very shimmering delicate voice, in my opinion. <BR>JP is as good as ever but he didn't have his own style of playing which he got onto later on Images and Words. He seemed to copy what Yngwie and P.Gilbert were doing at that time. But I still enjoy it. AWASOME tapping technique. Way superior than any of the other tappers around. I won't give names!!! The Limited Edition CD Package is very disappointing! Although it is much clearer. But I still recommend everybody this one. This album is showcases Kevin Moore's keyboard technique rather than the others. <BR>The songs are really amazing. I love all the tracks excpept maybe YTSE JAM, which I usually skip! Status Seeker is the highlight for me. Charlie is at his best. Get this as soon as possible to whoever reading this review! And compare it to Images and Words.
B0000542D2|5.0|The very best of everything that became the 60s is reflected in this infectious, joyful, vibrant and creative movie that broke forever the dreary formulaic pop-star flicks that doomed Elvis Presley et al.<br />I was there in the theater for the debut of this movie, and it's hard to describe the sheer happiness of our group of teenaged girls, all dressed in black, all with long straight hair and bangs, all with a \\"John Lennon\\" black leather hat (we were trying to look like a combination of the Beatles and their long-haired, all-in-black, gorgeous girlfriends at the time).<br />Surprise, surprise, the movie has endured. It works on two levels: One, to see just what it was about those four British boys that brought such inexpressable joy to an entire generation. Their cheekiness, their looks, their clothes, and above all, their music, was something heretofore unknown in the American pop culture, and we couldn't get enough of it.<br />On another level, A Hard Day's Night is just a darn good movie, from the innovative photography (black and white, unexpected and brilliant) to the offbeat and seemingly ad-libbed script to the direction to the boys themselves, who proved to be naturals. They were not asked to pretend to be something they were not: They were just their irrepresible selves at a time when all things seemed possible. This is a one-of-a-kind movie, a classic for its time and always, a microcosim of a time long gone and never to return.<br />If you haven't seen it, you are in for a wonderful treat. If you have, give it another look; it's even better than the last time you saw it, I guarantee it.
B000066NW0|4.0|When I first heard Avril Lavigne's &quot;Complicated&quot; on the radio, I did think it was Alanis Morissette, you can't deny the similarities between the two, both write their own songs and are Canadian and seem to be out in there own world. I loved that song so much I decided to check out the album for myself and for a 17-year-old singer/songwriter. I must admit it is a step in the right direction. Avril has alot of potential to really go somewhere and I am sure you will see her around 5 years from now. Of course, as an artist and in her album you can see that she has a few shortcomings, such as the need to be completely different as a skater punk rock child and the lack of maturity in some of her lyrics(&quot;He was a boy she was a girl. Can I make it any more obvious&quot;) but then again, she's only 17 and someone like Avril only gets better with time. Her songs have great beats and music behind them giving this entire album a sense of refreshing, youthful energy. And her voice has great power, range, and tone giving life to even her most awkward lyrics. Avril will outgrow her rebel girl stage and mature lyrically as well,but she already has the makeup of a great musician.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is a wonderful album! I can't take it out of my CD player! I really like &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; and &quot;I'm With You.&quot; If you have any desire at all to purchase this CD, do!
B000067CPX|5.0|This is a wicked album. I've been a fan ever since I watched the Peppers play Stone Cold Bush on Saturday Night Live. I have to say that this album is their most mature. This is the way I look at it: <BR>  Mother's Milk: Really punky and youthful sounding.<BR>  BloodSugarSexMagik: Loads better than Mother's Milk. The band had better chemistry than they did with Mother's Milk. More musical direction, and this led to one of the best records since \\"Are You Experienced?\\"<BR>  One Hot Minute: Great, but didn't quite sound like classic RHCP. Navarro brought something to the band though, like maturity. This record really does foreshadow Californication in hindsight, doesn't it?<BR>  Californication: Frusciante is back, and the Peppers write a really great album. Honestly, this album is a lot more experimental sounding than their other albums. Drearier sounding or something, y'know?<BR>  By The Way: Picks up where Californication left off. A major departure for the Peppers. This CD really kicks... There's a lot of energy in all the tracks, and as far as I'm concerned is as good as BloodSugar, just different.
0380789035|5.0|well, if you want comic books ask neil, if you want screenplays ask neil, if you want short srories ask neil, if you want...you get the idea. a storyteller in every sense of the word, neil writes stories in whatever form the muse tells him to, and everyone of them is brillant in their own way. this one is perhaps his longest, aside from the sandman books. It is also one of his best. the characters are alive (even the dead ones) on the page. it is just plain good. read it and change your world view a bit.
B000069HK2|5.0|The only way to describe this album is it f@#king rocks.
B000068PNQ|5.0|It is what a deluxe edition should be. Nice slip case. Real cool package. A 20-page booklet with all the lyrics. ALthough i don't see the point of having the stereo version, mono version and Nico's solo songs from the Chelsea Girls album in the same cd set, Velvet Underground / Nico deserves to have a deluxe edition just because of the classic songs like All Tomorrow's Parties, Sunday Morning, Venus In Furs and I'll Be Your Mirror. To tell you the truth, i think i'll still stick to the original remastered cd as it has a better flow than this kind of cd set with bonus songs, but this deluxe edition is obviously essential to every hardcore velvet fan. If you're a casual listener, buy the original remastered cd. If you're a velvet fan, buy this one. BTW, White light/white heat is even a more exciting album than this one. Don't ever miss it thanks
B000053VAZ|5.0|This was such a wonderful light-hearted movie.  It makes you believe in love all over again.  Take the time to see this one... it leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.  Enjoy!
0380820846|4.0|I have enjoyed all of the previous Bridgerton novels, when I heard that Colin was going to be paired with Penelope, I thought how odd.  It works!  All of the Bridgerton stories have been highly enjoyable.  Lady Whistledown is finally unmasked, what a surprise.  I enjoyed interaction between Penelope and Colin.  The book added greatly to my appreciation of Julia Quinn's work. Every lady should have a life's work.
B000067CPX|4.0|Apparently Californication was just a taste of things to come. The 'Chili Pepper's \\"By the Way\\" is a lush, structured melange of their more recent use of pop melodies, beach boy harmony, and stunning experimentation. Californication left 80's chili peppers fans wondering where the slap-bass had gone, but drew a new breed of followers with their radio-friendly format. This album picks up where Californication left off, keeping up the radio-ready guitar tunes but going in a very slightly harder but more often harmonic direction. This album got suprizingly introspective lyrically, with lead singer Anthony Keidis mulling about love, primarily, and even questioning America's dependancy on constant entertainment in \\"Throw Away Your Television\\". Keidis's voice is arguably stronger than on any other record. Drummer Chad Smith, however, seems to be lacking on this album, leaving behind the driving, powerful drums of Californication and BloodSugarSexMagik and hiding behind the guitar work of John Frusciante. Frusciante has moments of sheer brilliance on this album, but his repititious style becomes dull and boring on many of the songs. The guitar is certainly not as strong as it has been in the past. However, despite slightly menotonous guitar work and hidden drums, bassist Flea continues to write the occasional pulsing riff that was so potent throughout BloodSugarSexMagik. On a whole, \\"By the Way\\" is an good effort in the Chili Peppers' continuing pursuit of melodic pop-rock, and will most likely dominate this year's (2002) summer airwaves.
B000031XBQ|5.0|Abba is not just one of the best European groups of all time, they are one of the best groups ever worldwide! Oro, a collection of their Spanish tracks, proves that a great band sounds good in any language! Frida and Agnetha are just as powerful on the Spanish versions of 'Dancing Queen' and 'Fernando.' So, why did they record in Espanol anyway? Well, their English tunes made a huge impact worldwide, accept in Latin America. Thus, they decided, in the late 70's, to re-record some of their best songs in Spanish to break into the Latino market. Let's just say, it did the trick! Within a short amount of time, they were topping the charts from Mexico to Argentina. Abba were way ahead of their time, and continue to have success because of this. Even if you don't speak Spainsh, this album is still highly enjoyable from start to finish. Spanish, German, French, Swedish, and English: Abba recorded in all these languages during their time together. And managed to sound magical in each one.
6302378648|2.0|Sam Cady (Robert de Niro) has just been released from prison, and wants revenge on Sam Bowdon (Nick Nolte), the prosecutor who withheld evidence and sent him up. Cady begings stalking Sam's wife and daughter, so the family decides to hide in their houseboat in Cape Fear.<br /><br />I found this film way too violent for my taste. Robert de Niro is so convincing as the sadistic con that I could hardly watch him.  Nick Nolte is fine as the lawyer, but I thought Jessica Lange as his wife and Juliette Lewis as the daughter were  unappealing and miscast.  I prefer the original version of \\"Cape Fear\\" with Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck.
B000022TSV|5.0|The performances in this rendition of Carmen were splendid and the acoustics were excellent. I would highly recommend this DVD, but with only one small warning.<br />It is not well known, but there are two different versions of Bizet's opera Carmen.  The original version written entirely by Bizet himself, is rarely, if ever, performed.  That is the version presented on this DVD.  The only difference is in the so-called \\"recitative\\" parts.  Bizet's original version had the singers simply speaking, not singing, during the recitatives.  <br />Because Bizet's original \\"spoken\\" version was not initially well received, he decided to eliminate all speaking parts and replace them with sung-out \\"recitative\\" parts. Unfortunately, he died before he could could undertake this project.  However, others completed it after his passing.<br />The version usually performed in opera houses today, and found in the typical vocal score, is the revised version where the \\"recitatives\\" are sung.  However, the version used in this DVD is the original, where the \\"recits\\" are spoken and use different words than those used in the more commonly sung recitatives.  For most people, this won't matter (or may be found to be a plus).  For the opera singer trying to learn a part, this version won't give you all the recitatives in your score.  <br />However, even for that small group of listeners, I'd still recommend it as the vast majority of it matches the current vocal score, and it's done extremely well.
B000067CPX|2.0|LET ME START BY SAYING I STILL LOVE THE BAND.BUT THIS LAST ONE IS SAD.AS IN CALIFORNICATION THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO PUT ANTHONY UP FRONT IN THE MIX.DON'T THEY KNOW THAT THE STRENGHTH IN THE BAND IS FLEA AND CHAD.THEY DONT STAND OUT ANYMORE.SINCE THE INVENTION OF AUTOTUNE.THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE ANTHONY A SINGER.BUT STILL, HE CANT WRITE LYRICS.HE NEVER REALLY COULD BUT THIS ALBUM IS BAD.THERE ARE A FEW DECENT SONGS THOUGH.ONE BEING THE TITLE SONG.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Here is a pretty young lady that can sing. I really enjoy this CD. The only thing is that I don't speak Spanish so some of her songs are hard to follow but then again why do you need to? Her voice is pretty and the music is great.
B000063S6Z|5.0|This is a great release! Not only that, but every song is so different from the next that it never gets boring. Great traveling, or music at work too!
B0000214G6|5.0|9 1/2 weeks is without a doubt, THE SEXIEST FILM EVER MADE!!! I am so in love with Mickey Rourke in this movie--I can't even begin to tell you. It is an art film--very visually appealing, sexual, mysterious, and intriguing. I love this movie and I definently recommend it!!
B00006690G|5.0|Like a bald, modern-day Criswell, Eminem seems to know what's on our minds before we do.  Overflowing with songs of peace, love, and understanding, Eminem has created the definitive album for the post 9/11 world; this is precisely the right album for its time.  The underlying theme of the album is family, as Em pours out his heart to his mother, his ex-wife, and, most affectingly, his infant daughter.  In an age when love songs sound canned and written by rote, Em challenges both his listeners and his peers to demand more.  Best of all is that he consistently delivers.
B000067CPX|5.0|only these four indeviduals could have conjured up this great and illustreous album. It is polished to a sparkeling shine by Mark Ruben leaving very little that is unultered. The layers add depth while Anthoney's voice picks a softer more pleasent tone it is truly a treat to listen to. if you listen to this disc long enough you will pick up on riffs that were unoticed before a wunderful adittion to the mix. John's experimentation has given a few of the tracks a Radiohead feel although this is not done alot on this disc which leaves you wanting more. Lyics as they be are somewhat not understandable as with everyone of thier discs although if you let it all come together without too much thought they work. Title track &quot;by the way&quot; represents very little of what this disc has to offer although it is a catchy track as with all of them. All and all this is a very, very good lp which deserves thee adoration of many aspireing songwriters out there myself included. Highly recomended to fans of &quot;californication&quot; &quot;by the way&quot; takes the sound of that and asends to a new level of excelence. Where they go from here one can only wounder.
B00005YUNY|5.0|I'll keep this brief -  Great sound quality, great multi-camera shots, incredible musicianship, wonderful orchestration!  I loved it!  <br />I would challange anyone not familiar with YES or only vaguely so to sit and watch this without becoming a fan.  That would be impossible unless you were deaf.  <br />For a fan, this is far superior to any other filmed recording YES has made and is a must have.<br />I really enjoyed the longer pieces (Close to the Edge, The Gates of Delerium, Ritual) and I thought the new songs (Magnification, Don't Go, In the Presence Of) were well done.  The drum section in Ritual was FANTASTIC!<br />I suppose if I could change anything about it, with this line-up I would have left Owner of a Lonely Heart off the song list, but you must figure that it was such a successful and recognizable piece in the 80's they have to play it now.  And besides, Howe's solo at the end of it was well done.  <br />I would have also liked to see Awaken in this symphonic format, but it was well done on the House of YES video.<br />Buy this DVD!  You won't regret it!
B000066NW0|5.0|This cd is so awesome! Avril is taking the music world by storm. She is a young, confident, and extremely talented. Her music is straight from her heart so teens can easily relate to it. Avril's sk8ter punk look and sound is a refreshing change from the pop princesses like Britney and Christina.  Avril is happy with herself and doesn't have to dress in skimpy clothing and flaunt herself as the pop princesses do. Avril sums up her attitude on the enhanced part of her cd when she states,\\"If you don't like me for who I am, then you don't like me for who I am, and all you're gonna get...is who I am\\". Avril's powerful voice and creative lyrics are so addictive. It basically entrances the listener. Avril describes real things that have happened in her life and that most likely have happened in any teen's like people being fake, wanting to live life to it's fullest and be anything but ordinary, bad boyfriends, and even love. In Complicated she refers to people in life who are fake. Mobile is basically the story of Avril's transition to becoming the star she is by having to pack up and move to NY.  Avril's song Anything But Ordinary definitely describes her.  She is who she is and doesn't care if people like it or not. She said in an interview that she will not be like Britney and change her image so that people will like her. Let Go is also an enhanced cd, which makes it even better. This allows you to view the video to Complicated and even a day in the life with Avril.  This was so cool to me. It allowed me, as a fan, to see the real Avril and see that she is truly a down to earth teenager. She is truly an inspiration and deserves the respect of the music industry and her fans. She is a role model for her fans as well. So, I highly recommend this cd to any and all teens and hey adults, you might even like it too. Avril has created a whole new sound and she says best when she says that she would describe her music is \\"Avril Lavigne\\". Rock on Avril!!!
6303212379|5.0|This movie is a classic to me- a must have. I have loved this film since I was a child. It is such a great adventure and comedy that is fun for children and adults to watch. It is like watching the wizard of oz- you escape. The Goonies is a movie I will never get sick of watching- it's that great.
B00005JLF5|5.0|Deep Space Nine is just another sci fi series that I think is great.  It is its own universe.  I want to own the whole series, although I must add that I am more interested in owning the last 4-5 seasons more than the first few.  <BR>I don't remember too much about the first few seasons, but recall really getting into the story as soon as the Dominion entered into the scene.  From the discovery of the founders home world in the Gamma Quadrant of our galaxy, to the devastation of the Dominion Wars in the Alpha quadrant.  I was enthralled by the story telling and the space dog fights.  A very refreshing break from the typical Star Trek/  Star Ships on missions series...
B00005QDW1|4.0|First of all, for all the incompetent morons who say they hate all the songs on this album because it just repeats the chorus over and over again and have no additional lyrics, it's because you downloaded a preview of the song!  To share all the tracks on programs like AudioGalaxy and Kazaa, users simply took a 30 second preview of the chorus and repeated it for the length of about 4 minutes.  These are not the full songs and try actually buying the record, before criticizing it.<br />1. Intro - This is just the chorus of the last track &quot;Rock Steady.&quot;<br />2. Hella Good - I really liked this song before it was released to radio.  It got pretty annoying then.  I really like the song though. (8/10)<br />3. Hey Baby - This song is, in my opinion, one of No Doubt's best ever.  It's a catchy, undeniably good song. (9/10)<br />4. Making Out - This is a good song and reminds me of classic 80s stuff. (8.5/10)<br />5. Underneath It All - Gwen's vocals are great on this track.  It definitely has a reggae feel to it.  Some of the best lyrics on Rock Steady are in this track. (7.5/10)<br />6. Detective - I really like this song, but the chorus is annoying.  Not much new. (8/10)<br />7. Don't Let Me Down - One of the more poppish sounding songs, but a good one.  Reminds me of hearing it at a party once.  Good track. (9/10)<br />8. Start The Fire - I don't care too much for this one. It doesn't really flow well. (5/10)<br />9. Running - A lot of my friends like this one, but it's a little too contrived for me.  A pop ballad. (6.5/10)<br />10. In My Head - This is a good song on the album.  The lyrics aren't great, but the background music is. (8.5/10)<br />11. Platinum Blonde Life - Probably the most rock song on the album.  A good job by the band. (9/10)<br />12. Waiting Room - Prince helped out on this one and it has an R&amp;B flavor to it.  Not a personal favorite. (7/10)<br />13. Rock Steady - This one grows on you and in end, is probably the record's most impressive track. (9.5/10)
B0000666DW|4.0|The foundations of their music is difficult to define. They're one of those bands that you just have to hear for yourself. They combine aggression with emotion through their slamming power-chord progressions that vary from fast and upbeat, to slow and strikingly heavy. The guitar work is reminiscent of \\"Sound of Perseverance\\"-era Death with duel lead and a hyperactive, over-achieving rhythm section. Lots of experimentation is worked through each song, and melodic lines are also worked with that give Mastodon an energetic and raw, while also reflective and experimental sound that sticks out distinctly from most other bands I have heard. I first heard these guys throught their \\"Lifesblood\\" EP, and it took awhile to grow on me. It has an unbreakable mixture of dry, square rhythmics and dirty noisy sounds, all made solid and strong by a good quantity of metal rhythms. Vocally, you've heard it all before, but instrumentally, Mastodon stand head and shoulders above the modern metal pack. The reason I've downgraded it from 5 to 4 stars, though, is at times it's more impressive than it is enjoyable; the songwriting seems to suffer under the weight of all the technicality. That is, the music is impressive as you listen to it, but it is not all memorable once it stops playing. Plus, some of those slower interlude songs really break the album up in an annoying way. Maybe that's a little nitpicky, but it's enough to have caused me to edit this review. Standout track: Workhorse.
0380820846|2.0|Was so looking forward to another great Quinn novel, and was so very disappointed.  Just not her usual wit and banter.  Found it rather lacking, which is a FIRST for one of her novels.  I've read them all, and have loved them all, except for this one.
0767817478|1.0|Am I the only Godzilla fan out there that thought this movie sucked? Not only does this over sized iguana not have his \\"fire breathing\\" abilities(when he \\"breathes fire\\" it is only form the car and he just uses his breath to make it seem like it's from his breath), he is weak. This Goszilla is always on the run and never seems to actually want to destroy things. Oh wait, that's right, he is to busy giving birth. That's right, no Monster Zero, no Mothra, no Ghidora, no monsters at all. Now i know all the other Godzilla movies don't have a good \\"human\\" story line, so that part never bothered me, but there isn't as much action. Who cares if it looks fake? It's two guys in rubber suits dueling it out in a fake town. It's funny and action filled. Just because the American Godzilla has better graphics doesn't mean it's a better movie. Godzilla 2000 preserves the old ways of Godzilla, it's got a cheesy story line, the graphics aren't top of the line, and it's got two monsters battling, who cares if it doesn't look real, it's a movie. That's what they are there for. To be fictional. So despite this movie not being a real Godzilla movie, it still sucked. The American Godzilla went down wiht what, about six missles, three to each side. what a wuss. I don't care if a baby Godzilla survived, i want to see some major carnage. So a REAL godzilla fan knows Godzilla 2000 is better and this movie isn't.
B00003CXZ4|1.0|I suppose the only reason I could suggest this film to anyone is if I  have a sincere desire to torture someone else, or the person I'm referring it to is just as confused as this movie is. The movie from beginning to end is exactly that, confusing. The constant &quot;rewind technique&quot; the film seems to use is part of the love/hate issue I experienced. I think it's very trendy technique though. It's just they use it way to often. You get 5 minutes ahead only to go back 10. It's very frustrating for me to watch. The only reason I finished the film was that I wanted to see if all this rewinding/fast forwarding was going to pay off. Somehow it never did.
0792833279|4.0|John Travolta is hands down the most inconsistent leading man in America.  For every bomb (Battlefield Earth, and the horrid Urban Cowboy) there's a hit (Pulp Fiction and Michael). Anyone other than he would be doing well to be sitting in the upper left hand corner of Hollywood Squares, yet we always forgive Joh his misfires and we let him rivive his career over and over.<br />His sparkling performance in Get Shorty is why we are so forgiving.  His the wise guy with a heart schtick is never batter in this Elmore Leonard vehicle.  The film, which is Barry Sonnenfeld's best work other than Men in Black, is s send up of showbiz, the mob, and showbiz and the mob.  <br />Danny Devito plays what may well have been his last truly funny role, made all the more hilarious because his Brando-esque character takes himself almost as seriously as DeVito takes himself these days.  Renee Russo plays her role perfectly as do the rest of the supporting cast.<br />But this picture belongs to Dennis Farina whose character is brilliant.  Farina has more or less made an entire career playing this guy, and it all began with this truly funny movie.<br />Grab some popcorn, dim the lights, and enjoy this one over and over.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Russell Crowe has given the absolute best performance of any actor I've ever seen.  He &quot;reproduced&quot; John Nash on film at a level of 10 throughout. His performance grabs you and you are absolutely certain of his struggle with the mental illness.  He should have won best actor at the Academy Awards!  How can Jennifer Connelly win (and she deserved it) without Crowe winning? It is a ridiculous gaff.  I demand a recount!
B00001OH7Y|5.0|I started to listen to David Bowie when my sisters boyfriend introduced him to me. Well I already knew who he was an all that but I hadnt listened to his music a lot. I had walked in shops and seen his albums and in december of 2000 I bought a greatest hits album by him. I was very impressed and wanted to buy some of his LPs and there was a sale I didnt know what to get and I saw this album and luckily it was the Rykodisc. I saw that Ashes To Ashes was on it so I immediately bought it. I never regret it. Ive listened to most of his albums now and This is ineed my favourite the music is brilliant and Bowie is a genius but those who say this is his last masterpiece. Well let me say that I disagree. In 95 he released Outisde one of the best albums to come out that year and probably one of his better ones. But this is #1 in my place and buy it if you can.
B000001DTM|5.0|If U2 was being ripped apart about being too mainstream then (which I clearly remember they were), well then, they're even WAY too mainstream now... how can that even be possible?  I started losing interest in U2 after Zooropa, so to me, this is the last solid album they did.  Why? No filler, &amp; every single was a good track, which was half the album!<br />From a glimpse of the first track, you're not even sure it's the old U2 you had heard of.  &quot;Zoo Station&quot; is really a precursor to Zooropa, &amp; to me it sounds like it belongs on that album instead.  &quot;The Real Thing&quot; was my personal favorites from this album.  I agree with the editorial comment about &quot;One&quot; being one of U2's debatable &quot;best&quot; songs... but yes, everyone has their favorites.  It's a great song either way &amp; *sigh*, did suffer from some overplay.  When I first got this album, I was disappointed that the radio version of &quot;Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses&quot; wasn't on here, cuz I really like that version better.  I forget where that version can be found, so maybe someone else can enlighten us.  The 'gospel voice' by Bono in &quot;The Fly&quot; also foreshadows &quot;Lemon&quot; in Zooropa.  &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; was an instant favorite of mine, &amp; had an equally cool video.  The slower tracks compliment the other tracks well in that they're not too slow to make you lose interest &amp; do not lose the pace of the rest of the album.<br />I had to pull this album out today to see if I even still like it, &amp; it still has its appeal.  It really doesn't sound dated like it came out in 1991-1992, I just remember it came out then.  If you have no U2 album, start with this &amp; Joshua Tree...which is what I did, &amp; through the mid-90's, after hearing other singles from the 80's as well, they had slowly become one of my favorite bands.  As good as their earlier 80's albums are, it may be &quot;too 80's&quot; for some people...&amp; that decade split of fans really annoys me.  You guys know what I'm talking about, the fans who ONLY like 80's or 90's U2... or REM... or &lt;insert any other 2 decade old band here&gt;.  It seems to me that bands that have been around for a couple of decades have their most interesting, relevant, critically acclaimed, &amp; sometimes most popular albums in the middle of their career...for example, The Cure's 'Disintegration', Depeche Mode's 'Violator', to name a few.  Rarely does a good album deserve to be as popular as it was...or vice versa, depending on how you look at it.split of fans really annoys me.

B0000640VO|5.0|This is a great little film. I would encourage you to view it even if you are not keen on films with sub titles. The filming is made on a sort of semi Sepia/Colour and the film makers have included some nice magical touches to show Amelie's vivid imagination. Its a feel good movie and puts a smile on your face afterwards. I especially liked the Gnome gags and the tricks that Amelie pulls to get her man. This film should have one the best foriegn film Oscar. Vive Le France!
B000067CPX|5.0|I, much like a few others posting their reviews have been an RHCP fan since Mother's Milk and BSSM. Now, I don't know that if it's because I'm getting older (as they are too) but my tastes have changed throughtout the years. I like the more mellow stuff now and enjoy more meaningful music than I used to when I was younger. Maybe that's why I fully enjoyed this album. It's nice to see that the guys aren't still acting like they're 20 years old. I think they would be a joke if they tried. Instead, they've done something here that's really beautiful and meaningful to them. I think that shows in every track on this cd. What also shows on every track is John Frusciante's amazing talent and contribution. You hear and feel him of every song. <BR>It's kind of a surprise and kind of not. Somehow, it feels like Californication was just leading up to this. <BR>I think there's only one song that I could do without. But out of 16 tracks that's not bad.
B00005RFAI|2.0|Hmmmmmmmmm. This album is so bad. I dont have a word for it. First of all. The songs are bad. It lacks of depht and originality. The music is so so. And Pink thinks she is a rocker. Please. Her voice is dreadful and the lyrics are dumb. Her hair is terrible and the name Pink (oh please). If she is a punk rock chic she needs to make changes. Skip the executive producer crap. Go to another label Laface records. Hmmmm. The front cover well definately shot by a photographer either worked with Britney or Christina. The back cover well might think of Aaron Carter. and the album title Missundaztood not only is that a lame title for an LP that is supposed to represent the real you but is written like a title for a rap album. The songs and the music on the LP are bad and her voice is weak. This is not a rock music its pop a teeny pop even more than Britney. And By the way saying that your parents hated you after reading a lot of interviews you seem to get a long with your parents well and they did nothing wrong as you say because if I were a parent of a spoiled bratt who doesnt appreciate the way she lives and always gets arrested and doesnt do her homework and whatever I would throw her out.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|After reading many of the reviews that have been made I feel I have to say this after all it is a movie.  While I admit that I had to be dragged to movies to see this one (let's face it mental illness just didn't seem entertaining)I'm glad I did go to see this movie.  I think all the reviews have a point about the story being by the standard formular.  However, when have you ever seen a movie that could live up to the book or the life of the individual for which it was written.  The point of a movie is to entertain us not provide us history book facts.  The best we can hope is that the movie did what this one did for me.  This movie stired an interest in me enough so that I went to look up and discover more about John Nash.  I wanted to know who he was and the details of what he did in his life.  I must say that if it hadn't been for this movie the name John Nash would have become just another in a pile of names you know you have heard but can't really remember where or why.  I think that with all the really bad movies out there if you can find one that is somewhat factual you've done well.  After all if you left in the details do you realize how long the movie would have been?  What your mind can imagine in a few seconds it takes pages to convey in words.  What was really beautiful about this movie is that it allowed me to open my mind and go discover someone else.
B00000DQSZ|5.0|My first exposure to this band was this album, and via the track, \\"Europe Endless\\". I recall saying to myself \\"if i hear that chord progression once more...........\\" that was back in 1983. It took a bit of time, but finally I understood what Kraftwerk were telling me. Music should flow seamlessly, trance like, with no sudden bumps in the road, and this is what it delivers. From the foundations of rythm, or texture, they slowly build, gradually adding more, then slowly stripping down, to finally arrive where they began.<BR>This album opens with the beautiful \\"Europe Endless\\", this sets the scene for the later half of the album. Next it moves into two fairly straight foward pop tunes, one of which is the classic \\"Showroom Dummies\\".<BR>From here Kraftwerk now make their point, \\"Trans-Europe Express\\",  is an epic track that chuggs along like a train. Travelling smoothly, no detours, no seams, just as music should be in the land of Kraftwerk. \\"Metal On Metal\\" arrives, and proves that there is a place for industrial noises in pop with its banging of rubbish cans, and metal precussion. The album then comes to a close just were it began, with \\"Franz Schubert\\" and a reprise of \\"Europe Endless\\", \\"Endless Endless\\". Kraftwerk leave you just were you began.<BR>Many have claimed that Kraftwerk invented hip-hop, electronic pop, and trance. Whatever the case, Kraftwerk are still about, and leave all these trends in there wake.
B00005ARDC|5.0|I have to say - I really don't agree with much of what any of these other people write while reviewing this CD.  First of all - I would not compare BRMC with Jesus and Mary Chain.  I shouldn't say this because I was a big fan of the Mary Chain back in the day - but, Mary Chain NEVER created the depth, energy, or instrumantally layered intricacy of this BRMC album.  Love and Rockets from their 7th Dream of Teenage Heaven or ever their earlier Bauhaus or Tones on Tail efforts would much better describe the BRMC vibe.  Yet, BRMC IS different still, and I find it to be very inspired and innovative.  How could people try to say this band is regurgitating a sound that has already happened -  when there are in reality very few comparisans that can be made for who BRMC sound like - and there are a million bands like Jimmy Eat World and Blink 182?? = now there is an example of regurgitated sound for ya (not that I hate the Blink 182 bands or anything - they are still better than Britny Spears and the likes of her crap.)  Basically I have to leave by saying - if you like the Strokes, if you like Swervedriver, Love and Rockets (old stuff), Sunny Day Real Estate, Elbow, Doves, Muse, Radiohead, Moose, or Sparklehorse - then you really should make room in your collection for BRMC because they are a GREAT BAND.
B000006OAM|5.0|First of all, the Amazon review was ridiculous.  The album may be a bit dark, but what of it?  It is entertaining, and there is not a bad track on it.  Miss Merchant deals with some rather profound issues, with a positive message.  How many artists today do you hear sing about how sweet life is, no matter what your circumstances or what other people say?  The songs on this album are weighty, but without bogging down. <br />Above all, the album is entertaining and enjoyable, which is the true standard by which artists work should be judged.  Natalie Merchant has the three things needed for enjoyable music.  She has the best voice in pop music. The music itself is very good.  The lyrics are meaningful.  <br />I have a 5 CD changer by my bed.  It is loaded with 5 Natalie Merchant CD's (going back to 10000 Maniacs).  Her album work is great, and she is even better in concert!
B000068TP0|5.0|Shakira's acclaimed 1999 MTV UNPLUGGED performance has finally been released on DVD (what took them so long?), and she is in top form vocally, singing emotively over mostly rearranged versions of key tracks from her two most recent Spanish-language albums.  Also included is a &quot;Making Of...&quot; documentary and other lesser extras.<br />I feel Shakira's music can be appreciated on a variety of levels, even if one doesn't speak or understand Spanish.  However, this DVD has an option for adding English subtitles that really adds another dimension to the performance for me.  Her lyrics range from witty to poignant...I feel fortunate to finally understand what other reviewers have been saying for years about her gift for words.
B000051VWW|5.0|I never bought an Album for Sade before I just loved an old song for her called 'ordinary love'I used to think she's boring. My Kinckboxing instructer used to play few songs of her new album in the cool down session after a cardio work out, and I loved the 'King of sorrow' it is an amazing song with great lyrics. Then when I bought the Album I Loved it, each song is different from the other and the music with Sade's voice is incredably relaxing and cooling. All the songs are great: 'king of sorrow','by your side'great heart touching and romantic, 'flow' sexy song, 'somebody allready broke my heart' increadbly bitter but sweet, 'Every word' I love this song great music outstanding, 'Immigrant' nice rythem great words, 'lover's rock' Very nice romantic song, 'The sweetest gift' Sweet sad and increadably romantic, 'Slave song' is great too. All the songs are great the poem, the music, her voice all match great together This is a must buy.

0380820846|5.0|It's so hard to keep a series going and keep it fresh, but Quinn has managed this 4th installment with great success. The book is funny, witty and although a bit slow at a few places, the only reason it is so is because if you're a fan of the series you've just been WAITING for these two to get it together for so long!  <br />Quinn's novels have never completely bowled me over, I enjoy a couple other authors a little more reliably, but I am glad to add this one to my collection.  Her solid writing and sense of humor are evident in each novel.  The characters in this particular book are great to enjoy whether you've read the rest of the series or not.<br />I was really intrigued by the thank you note the author included in the beginning - she thanks Stephanie Laurens and another author for the use of their characters - had me re-reading a lot of my other books too just to see which characters she was referring to.... :)
B0000508U6|5.0|I had this CD in my car CD changer for over a year, it never gets old.  These guys are definately giving us something new and inpirational.  It's all there, the music, the lyrics, the overall feeling.  The mood is a little depressing, but soooo good.  The more you listen to it, the more you'll like it.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne, the fun, spunky, skater girl from Canada, with deep, up beat lyrics has captured the attention of rockers and poppers alike. Her album debut \\"Let Go\\" is an awesome combination of touching lyrics and super catchy tunes.  It started at number eight on the Billboard music charts, then slipped down two spots to ten, climbed back up to five, and has been rising ever since. The first track \\"Losing Grip\\" is about a girl who feels invisible to a guy that she gave her heart to.  A song for anyone who's had their heart broken by that \\"special someone\\", it's incredibly touching and true to life.  The same goes for \\"Too Much To Ask\\", these are songs about girls dealing with the immaturity and disappointment of the opposite sex, all things that most audiences can relate to.  The first single \\"Complicated\\" rocked our world with a message about being yourself in a world full of posers and transparency.  This hit went to number one on the Muchmusic countdown, several site lists on the web, and finally MTV's TRL.  The next possible singles \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" and \\"I'm With You\\" are angst-y songs dealing with teen love and a young girls struggle with relationships and emotional roller coasters.  A very different track and probably the most ambitious is \\"Nobody's Fool\\" in which the rocker chick drops a little rap into the mix.  It may not be the best song on the album but it has definite meaning and toe tapping intrigue.   \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" is about being different and going against the grain. This, like her other sweet tunes, is an inspiration to everyone out there who's ever been hurt by being called a \\"freak\\" or a \\"punk\\".  She demonstrates that it's enough to just be who you are without having to answer to anyone but yourself and the people you love.  Upon her first album, Avril has proven that she has what it takes to survive in a world full of bubble gum and Britney.  With a fresh and rockin' new sound Avril Lavigne has topped the music charts and captured fans with an amazing album that will make them never want to \\"Let Go\\".

B00006690G|4.0|Another product from Eminem. This album is great stuff but I think that the songs in it are not as catchy as in The Marshell Mather as the new album is not as hard core as the previous which made Eminem seems abit off. We like Eminem because of what he is right?But of course there are still some good songs in it, such as \\"buiness\\" very catchy beat, sounds similiar to \\"real slim shady\\" and \\"cleaning out my closet\\", Eminem dissed his own mother for bad parenting may be the next hit single.\\"without me\\", everyone should know.\\"hailie song\\", most anticipating song, Eminem sings, very good track.Overall, this is qiut a good album worth buying.
B00005Q6NY|3.0|Personally, I like the old stuff better.  This album seems a little more repetitive than older Zeppelin albums.  If you are a die-hard, you'll want it anyway!
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album is not exactly very good, I gave it 5 stars because of its usefulness of relieving stress and venting frastrution.<BR>But I admit that some songs on this album is great like \\"The way i am\\" it describe about the everyday stress that everyone faced,<BR>and it seems like eminem is helping you to tick off people. \\" real slim shady\\" one of the most catchies track in this album, good for relaxing.In  any way, this is a good album for people facing a lot of stress, I highly recommend it.
B00005RIKD|4.0|I bought this album second hand and, although I had doubts, I wasn't disappointed. It is (unlike the latest best-selling dud \\"Brand New Day\\") good to have if you like the work of this British musician. This live concert is a mix of his old hits (some go back to his days in \\"The Police\\") and some new songs.  I am not a very big fan of his new stuff, but the live version to my surprise makes it sound and feel different and quite OK.<br />This album was recorded (incredibly enough) on September 11, 2001 in Tuscany (it was dedicated to the victims of the NY tragedy). If you wish to expand your Sting collection this will be to my view a better choice than anything Sting recorded since 1993 \\"Ten Summoner's Tales\\".
B000067CPX|4.0|In this album, The Red Hot Chili Peppers came up with new styles and continue their look from their previous hit album, Californication. With new chorus' and funk guitar riffs, the album surges with Mexican rhythms and doo-wop harmonies. From their newest single \\"By The Way\\", brings out their introduction to the album with rapid guitar riffs, rapid verses and a chorus that eveyone would expect to come out from the album. The album also includes great styles and textures that can be found in \\"Dosed\\" and \\"The Zephyr Song\\". The album doesn't offer the same sweet harmonics in most of their songs, but comes with a great twist filled with funk guitar riffs in their song \\"Can't Stop\\". \\"On Mercury\\" pulses a ska flavor and \\"Cabron\\" fills the album with a style of Gloria Estefan and The Beach Boys\\". With alot of great riffs and great songs, the album still pursues the same experiences that with have listened from Californication. Other than that, the Red Hot Chili Peppers still have a pro to entertain their fans.
0140120416|4.0|This book is good for those who want to learn Russian on their own.  It starts out with the basic material, such as the alphabet and numbers, that some books/software assume you already know.  The book works best when you combine it with a software program so that you can hear the words too.
B000067CPX|5.0|This album is BRILLIANT!  It doesn't have as much of the punk edge and the rawness as their earlier work, but it is still open, honest and powerfull.  I could go on for many paragraphs about how GREAT the Chili Peppers are and how much I LOVE them and this new album, but thats not very informative:)  I will tell you that this album has a good diversity of sound and style.  Overall, there is a dreamy, almost mellow quality to most of the songs though.  Whether you would enjoy the higher energy songs like \\"Can't Stop\\", or the latin style \\"Cabron\\" or the sad and beautiful \\"Dosed\\" more, this album is not to be missed.<br />Bottom line, \\"By The Way\\" is GREAT, and anyone who likes the Chili Peppers and/or great music needs to hear this.
B000066NW0|5.0|After my recent reluctance to purchase the Avril Lavigne CD &quot;Let Go&quot; based solely on the single &quot;Complicated&quot; was overcome, I broke down and purchased it at my local record store. It was well worth the money paid. The album starts of with the surprisingly heavy-edged &quot;Losing Grip&quot; and is a roller coaster ride from that point. This is a refreshingly adult sounding album coming from a 17 year old self professed skater punk. Although far from punk, Avril does convey the rock attitude so welcome in todays music world of 'boy bands' and pre-fab female artists. <br />While the lyrics are simply Avril's attempt to prove how independant and unique she is, the catchy melodies more than make up for it. This is one well produced album that the record company was wise to spend the extra studio budget on. The slick guitar riffs and polished music sounds great on any sound system, from the slow melencholy songs to the &quot;pedal-to-the-metal&quot; rockers. <br />If Avril tours constantly and can shed any perception as a studio creation, I see nothing but a bright future. With artists such as Alanis Morrisette and Label-mate Pink having paved the way, there is no reason Avril Lavigne can't join them in the upper eschelon of female rock artists.
B000067CPX|5.0|First a little history. Im 30 years old and have been listening to the Chilli Peppers since I was 18. There music totally threw me back then and although completely different, still throws me now. They have definitley grown as people as well as musicians. I think By The Way is one of the smartest CDs musically, that Ive heard in a long time. My other musical interest are Rush, Faith No More, U2, Tool...So my musical interests are pretty broad. I play the guitar, so I really zeroed in on Frusciantes contributions to this album...and the are AMAZING!... The rest of the band is right on q as well..Flea is one of the greatest bass players out there..Next to Geddy Lee of course...BUY THIS ALBUM!... It is well worth it.
0140143505|5.0|I happened upon this first in the movie version, which starred Ann Bancroft. It was sensitive, subtle, intelligent, romantic and witty -- qualities seldom found in movies today. Shortly after seeing the movie, I discovered it was available in book form. I'm intensely aware of the gap between movies and the books they try to emulate, so I was anxious to read the print version.<br />WOW!<br />October 5, 1949. Helene Hanff is a writer who is determined to acquire a solid education in classical English literature so she writes a letter to a small bookshop (at 84 Charing Cross Road) to ask about some rather obscure works she'd like to read. She's seen their ad in the Saturday Review of Literature and is encouraged by the fact that they specialize in out-of-print books.<br />Thus begins, with one short, polite inquiry, a chain of events that changes Hanff's life and eventually (in 30 years) catapults her into fame.<br />It is Hanff's personality that carries the story. Writer-like, she infuses it onto paper as she comments on the books she receives and requests more. As WWII ravages England, Hanff sends food packages of rare treats to the penpals she develops at the bookstore. Employees write to her, she exchanges recipes with them and shares her observations as she reads. <br />The manager of the store, Frank Doel, slowly evolves into a romantic figure as Hanff cajoles, teases and chides him and he responds in a particularly British manner.<br />If you love books and people, abhor violence and gratuitous sex, and if you're content with subtleties in relationships combined with sensitive observations about life and literature, this is your book. It's normal, healthy, charming and funny -- a far cry from everyday movie and \\"literary\\" fare.
B00005QHPQ|3.0|I ordered his Escape cd, instead I received the cd that is named after him.  Also the case was badly damaged.  I would have ordered this cd evenually, but I really wanted the other one.
B00005RHGK|3.0|Surprisingly, I think this film didn't turn out half bad. Since most horror movies are geared towards a teenage, blood and gore hungry audiance, one might be hesitant to view something like this.<br />But even though it had a no-name cast, not-to-brilliant storyline, and B-rated feel to it, I think it turned out well.<br />So we begin this wonderful film with two siblings on an afternoon drive, I forget where there going. But they stumble upon someone throwing what looks like a body into a sewage pipe leading underground. And, of course, they talk each other into going back to investigate their find. <br />Then, as the awesome and highly talented screenwriters would have it, the boy falls into the pipe. He encounters basically a Van Gogh of slaughter, but don't worry it ain't that scary. Personally I found it rather humourous. <br />After all that they make their way to a gas station, and the boy recieves a phone call from a strange old women that tells them to listen for a song called 'Jeepers Creepers.' If they hear it that means something terrible will happen. Cool.<br />And that is when we learn who is responsible for the things I described above. Except, it isn't a \\"who\\" its a what. The movie, I don't think, really described in detail what the thing was except that its some kind of demon who takes specific body parts from each victim. <br />And that is when it begins. To not give too much away, we just witness a series of gruesome attacts by the \\"thing.\\" The story will unfold and other important characters will come into play. I enjoyed the ending especially for its unpredictability, and the scene in the police station was very suspenseful...
B0000696I0|5.0|I think that TMNT: II is the best of the series. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD. I have been a fan of the Turtles since TMNT came out in the 80s. I am going to buy TMNT II & TMMNT III when they come out on DVD. I already have TMNT: The Movie on DVD. I have the soundtracks on CD for all three TMNT movies. I love the song Ninja Rap from TMNT II.
B000067CPX|3.0|That's pretty much my take on this one.  Whatever.  When these guys pick up the tempo, the music simply owns your stereo.  Nobody can deliver driving grooves, funky licks, and rhythmic beats like the Chilis can.  And while it's true they make good songs when they slow it down a bit, that's not what brings me back to a particular album.  In my opinion, if you like the softer and gentler Peppers, this one's for you.  If you're hoping that this album unleashes that old Red Hot energy and passion, you may be disappointed. The songs are good, let me be clear about that.  I especially enjoy track 1.  The title track has a great pace mixed with some of that fantastic vocal work these guys have developed.  It's one of those songs that earns a few clicks to the right on the volume knob of your player (you know the ones I'm talking about) and this album needed about 4 or 5 more of them.  As for many of the rest, though these songs are perfectly listenable, they invoke nothing in me and are for that reason fairly forgettable.<br />Again, this was just my personal reaction.
B000066NW0|5.0|It is no surprise that the world has greeted newcomer Avril Lavigne with open arms. At 17, the singer-songwriter presents herself on her debut album with elegance and style---and, as the result of the music's undertones, listeners of all ages can readily identify with her headstrong ideals, free-spirit tendencies, and occasional angst.<br />Avril represents much of the population today. The rugged individualism found on such tracks as \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" and \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" strike a chord with everyone from adolescents in their teens who may be starting to find their own ideals, to adults struggling to establish their place in the world in their 20s and 30s, all the way to older folks trying to come to grips with their own identity as they stumble into middle age.<br />While she is capable of touching many people with her music, Avril Lavigne will enjoy continued success because of her own individuality. Who can resist in-your-face rockers like \\"SkaterBoi,\\" or say they can't relate to the raw emotion felt on \\"Losing Grip\\"?<br />Unlike so many of pop's stars today, Avril is a real person. One can be sure that the person they see on the stage would be the same if they saw her anywhere else. <br />You can tell by tracks like \\"Complicated,\\" and \\"My World,\\" that this is a girl who has walked similar paths to all of us sitting at home listening to her record. Whether it's on the subject of relationships, lame part-time jobs, or small town life (Avril reveals to us on one cut that she grew up in a town with a 5,000 population), she covers all the bases, giving us every reason to believe that Avril is one of us. She simply has emerged from the masses to step up to the microphone and share her amazing talent with the rest of the world. <br />Avril Lavigne may be the voice of the new millennium. Today, the world is an undeniably vulnerable place. In light of recent events, life in much of the world is almost like a hurricane. Simply stated, I would suggest grabbing on to a copy of Avril Lavigne's \\"Let Go\\", as a tree to hold on to during these turbulent times.
0425098532|4.0|This is a very very good legal/coutroom thriller. The scenes of Elinor Carlisles trial are excellent, and show yet another aspect of Christie's talent.<br />However, this novels lacks one thing. Any credible suspects to choose from. (Apart from two.) As such, its a bit of a daft mystery. the other suspects only come into the readers orbit once or twice in the entire story, so we dont even really consider them.<br />However, the plot construction is still good, the writing also, and the developement of the characters (especially Mary and Elinor) is very good. Poirots deductive powers are called to the fore once again. And even though there are so few real suspects, the solution manages to come as a bit of a surprise.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Sometimes a good book is made into a great movie (Wizard of Oz), and sometimes a great book is made into a good movie (Black Stallion)- this was a great book made into a great movie. There is nothing significant added to the movie as it is very true to the book, but there is an amazing reproduction of what most of us would have thought was our individual vision of Rowling's world.<br />I was thrilled with the movie in the theater, I was just as enthralled with this DVD at home.  For those of you who haven't read the book - watching the DVD will give you an excellent feel for the world within Rowlings magical books.  Owning this DVD will allow you to revisit the original story, or allow a younger child to `catch up' to the series.  Rowling's world is a world of Light and Darkness, good verse evil, magic and bravery and plenty of adventure.  The lessons taught are lessons in surviving hard times, making the right choice (not the easy choice), putting the wellbeing of others before your own, and standing up for what you believe in.<br />As a Christian I have great difficulty believing that letting children turn their imaginations lose into this magical fantasy will somehow take them to the dark side. I grew up reading about Casper the friendly ghost and his friend Wendy the witch, and I have yet to practice any kind of black magic or voodoo - but it did help to develop a lifetime love for reading.<br />Adding this movie to your home collection will be a good investment.  It's the perfect movie for rainy Saturday nights, popcorn and family.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|I really wanted to give this 5-stars, because most of the songs are SO good. The opening song, \\"New York, New York,\\" is bright and shiny, and the closing song, \\"Goodnight, Hollywood Blvd.\\" is a beautiful ballad, and just the right note to end on. \\"Firecracker,\\"  \\"Answering Bell,\\" and \\"Somehow, Someday\\" are nice songs influenced by country, rock and folk.  \\"When The Stars Go Blue,\\" \\"Wild Flowers\\" and \\"Harder Now That It's Over\\" are nice ballads with lyrics that actually MEAN something.  The \\"Rescue Blues\\" and \\"Touch, Feel & Lose\\" are excellent blues-rock numbers.  In fact, \\"Touch, Feel & Lose\\" SCREAMS for a live version-no holding back, big loud band! It's my favorite track on the CD.  \\"Nobody Girl\\" and \\"Tina Toledo's Streetwalkin'Blues\\" are straight up rock numbers and are good but not great songs.  The songwriting is great, the musicianship and vocal delivery are magnificent.  So why only 4 stars?  Because I hate, really HATE \\"Enemy Fire\\" and \\"SYLVIA PLATH,\\" and find them unlistenable.  \\"Gonna Make You Love Me\\" sounds so much like just a throwaway or afterthought.  I think this guy has a 5+ in him, there is real talent on display here, and when he learns that TOO MUCH is really too much, he'll get there.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|A brilliant idea to put all 27 no 1 singles by the greatest band ever on a single cd. Anybody who cries about the sound(it's just great)or song content is the same type of person who would find a 1000 dollar bill in the street and complain that it had a wrinkle in it!!!
B00005JKQZ|2.0|We all know the basics of this movie: genius goes crazy, has a lot of trouble, but love of a good movie brings him back to some semblence of normality. I believe that if I had not heard how much I was going to love love love this movie, I would have liked it better. <br />It's a fine movie, but not up to some of Crow's other films (I'm thinking of LA Confidential or Romper Stomper). Jennifer Connelly has yet to do a bad job in my book. Ed Harris is always good, and does not disappoint.<br />The reason I give two stars is that it seems a little too self-consciously epic and sweeping, and leaves me wanting to still know more about the life these people lived. But the story is a good one, and all the actors do a good job. <br />All in all, a good little movie for a Sunday afternoon.
B0000047EC|5.0|I have been a fan of Pat Metheny for years, but I have never purchased any of his music.  I was at a cocktail party in Rome and I heard this CD and I said to my self what is this? &quot;I have to have this CD&quot;.  For me this CD embodies harmony, peace, and happiness.  The story of Pat and Charlie is also something that will draw you in to this wonderful piece of work.
B00005YU1O|2.0|Hey, I love cartoons & old comics & graphic novels. I love Kierkegaard & Sartre & Schopenhauer & Norman O. Brown & Rupert Sheldrake. I love playing with Adobe photoshop, especially the Artistic Filters. And I really think Slacker was one of the major breakthrough films of the last 50 years. So I think I may know where Richard Linklater was coming from when he made this movie. But I don't understand what happened. The animation concept was fantastic, but the result is horrendous. What's with the weird expressionless eyes that shift out of register in every frame (as does just about every other element in this amateurish & ugly pic)? The long shots look like they used a totally different animation technique from the close-ups. Worst of all, though is the adolescent drivel drooling (or sometimes sputtering) out of the mouths of the \\"characters\\". Slacker was funny because everyone was spouting a different \\"personal\\" philosophy (or \\"life-take\\"). Here you get the kind of theoretical brain showers adolescents experience when doing their first joint. BIG MISTAKE.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne just lets go in this cd. She speaks her mind. If you thought her debut single &quot;complicated was good then you would love her other songs. Anyone with an open mind and good taste in music would love &quot;let go&quot;. I highly recommend it.
0783217048|5.0|This is one of the best drag/cult movies ever made, it ranks up there right next to \\"Queen of the Dessert\\"!!...my VHS copy is on its last legs and I need to get a new one!!
B000000OSE|5.0|This is a masterpiece. The songs Coma and Don't Damn me take the<BR>cake . It does have its share of junk though -the garden ,the garden of eden ,you aint the first and live and let die . It's not Rose whose to blame ,in my opinion Live and let die is a bad song anyway .<BR>Coma is presumably about a drug addict-he's so desperate. You can feel his pain . November Rain is very good specially the guitar in the end . <BR>Definitely comparable to appetite.
0743200799|4.0|&quot;They made it look easy,&quot; said a reviewer for another Apollo book, and it's true. When I was a kid, I loved to watch the space program - I realized it was dangerous - but the sheer amount of hard work needed to pull it off never dawned on me. This is a book by one of the guys who made it look easy.<br />The author seems pretty straight-up, dedicated, hard working, decent.<br />The topic is interesting, and the author well-placed to describe the inner workings of the space program.<br />I love that he wrote the book himself, without the polish of a ghostwriter. Seems like unabashed, unvarnished straight goods.<br />Perversely, the lack of polish is probably the book's biggest drawback.<br />However there are lots of interesting goodies about Mercury and Gemini, in addition to Apollo.<br />Also, I never realized how important a military background seemed to be in the program. It was a civilian program, but a good number of people seemed to have been ex-military. I found myself wondering how I would shape up.<br />I had a good chuckle with some of his comments on engineers - I'm sure I've given the same &quot;non-answers&quot; myself many times.<br />Some slight negatives:<br />I thought he might have described some of the background information better. <br />I was looking for some idea of how NASA was organized - how did they manage to pull off something so complex? The book doesn't spend a lot of time explaining job titles and such - which at first, seemed frustrating - but maybe that is the answer, that organizational charts and bureaucracy don't really matter - dedication and competency do matter.<br />Curiously, post-Apollo events get little coverage, but many other books have the same fault. I would look forward to seeing a post-Apollo book by the same author.
B000000OSG|5.0|This contains some amazing material locomotive,estranged,civil war to name but a few. My world is odd and I don't like yesterday's . I wish they wouldn't do covers their own songs are so much better though I must say their version of Knockin on heaven's door is far better than Dylan's . Don't cry on this is better . 14 years is decent . A must buy for anyone . <BR>Use your illusions to get away from  life . I think he must mean that . They've written so many songs about breaking away -paradise city,coma . <BR>A definite must buy .
B00004TRD8|5.0|he said he would be back and he is, besides this great movie, there is hundreds of extras including a full special edition movie with all deleted scenes included. This movie should hold you over until Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. Don't underestimate the power of a Terminator.
0307203204|5.0|Fans of the golden age Disney films and animation in general are very familiar with the brilliant career of color genius Mary Blair, one of the most important graphic and commercial artists of the century, and some of her best work is found right here between these covers.  These beautiful illustrations are among the warmest and most engaging she ever did.  \\"I Can Fly\\" is one of the very earliest (and best) Golden Books, and this miniature edition seems to be complete, unlike the more common modern reprints which are severely truncated.  The color reproduction isn't a hundred percent accurate, either, but unless you want to spend considerable time at the swap meets or on eBay, this is your best bet. For more about Mary Blair (as well as Golden Books hall of famer Gustav Tenggren and many others) see John Canemaker's excellent book \\"Before The Animation Begins\\".  Oh, yeah, and if you're a real little kid you'll find it much easier reading than this slightly pompous review.
6305171769|5.0|Halloween H20 is among the best of the series.  I am writing this review on July 11, 2002...the day before the latest Halloween movie (Halloween: Resurrection) hits theaters.  It is my hope that Halloween: Resurrection will leave off where H20 ended and explain whose head was actually cut off at the end of the movie.  You didn't think it was Michael did you??<br />I knew the first time I saw H20 that it was not Michael who died in the end.  He put the clothes and mask onto someone else...I can't say who because I am unsure.  <br />Anyway, this is a review for H20..not the upcoming Halloween: Resurrection.  I found H20 to be a wonderful movie, although Michael's presense didn't really play a factor until the last half hour of the movie!  Still, I recommend Halloween H20...I know you will enjoy it!
B000067CPX|2.0|Sure, this is a nice album, but where did the Chili Peppers go?  You know, the guys that defined funk for the 80's and 90's.  This is an artsy, pleasant album with little to no evidence of the funk power of the Peppers (except three tracks: By The Way, Throw Away Your Television, and Can't Stop).  If your idea of good Peppers tunes include strings, latin rhythms, keyboards, and Beach Boys harmonies, by this CD.  If you want something even moderately uptempo, burn the aforementioned songs and add them to Californication.  First HUGE new release disappointment of the year for me...
B00005LC6Z|4.0|Michael Myers does not seem to keep himself hidden from view in this sequel.  He walks around Haddonfield and the hospital in clear sight of everyone.  Still, Halloween 2 maintains the plot of the original and continues the storyline.  The same characters are brought back and the story continues on the same night the original ended.  I give this movie 4 stars because of its variation of Myers actions, including non-typical random killings and more blood.  Halloween 2 is a great movie despite the minor changes and I think you will certainly enjoy it.
B000067CPX|5.0|Top album, top band.... may be a bit more mellow than the older stuff but every bit as good lyrically and musically!
6301562925|4.0|Picking up immediately where Halloween 4 left off, Michael continues to chase his niece with the intent to kill her.  We find that his niece now has a telepathic bond to her uncle and can visualize/feel his presence when he is about to kill again. This movie contains more blood and violence than is typical of the Halloween series, but overall I really think it is a great movie to own!
B000002AP1|5.0|I don't care what most people say about the new re-mix, it does the job of making your ears bleed more than anything that's available on the `metal/punk' market nowadays (unless you listen to Japanese punk bands).  From the guitar onslaught of `Search and Destroy' and `Your Pretty Face is Going To Hell' to the savage glam stomp of `Penetration' and `Death Trip', if there was going to be an apocalypse, this would be the CD I'd take in the bomb shelter!!!
B0000039LE|5.0|Halloween is definitely the greatest horror movie ever filmed.  It is a classic and to this date, there have been no horror movies that invoke pyschological fear as deeply as Halloween.  Michael Myers is unlike any serial killer because he has a determination to kill only specific people...not random teenagers.  I recommend this movie highly and I feel that you will also like it as much as I do.
B000068QVN|5.0|The Greatest Arena Rock Group There Ever Was. These Guys Rock. This CD Has Captured Them At Their Best. To Bad There Was Not More From Shea On This. As A Hard Core Fan I Have Been With This Band From The Beginning And Till The End.So Come On And Ride The Railroad One More Time.
0553212737|5.0|Actually, every Jane Austen is essential, so the title of this review is pretty unnecessary.<br />I just finished Emma.  I've had this book on my shelf for over a year, hesitant to read it because I've seen the movie (the Gwyneth version) about 100 times.  I was worried that there would be no suspense in the book for me, having memorized the movie characters so well.<br />I needn't have worried.  Books are never the same as movies.  I found even more to love about Emma as I read this book, and grew to like other characters (such as Jane Fairfax) more, and other characters, such as Frank Churchill less.  While this book did not hold the suspense for me that Pride and Prejudice does (still!), it was nonetheless a great read and I can't wait to reread it next summer.
B00005Q3KC|5.0|If you love them, or you're new to them, this is the album for you. For you seasoned fans like myself, this album is just a reminder of The Corrs' amazing career of breathtaking music. It will bring back memories of Forgiven Not Forgotten, Talk on Corners, and the recent In Blue. They've put their best songs on here, and it's worth every cent. To me, every song The Corrs have ever made is a gem, but here, you'll get those #1 hits like &quot;So Young&quot;, &quot;Breathless&quot;, and the absolutely unforgettable &quot;Runaway&quot;, which ultimately launched The Corrs. <br />If you're new to The Corrs, I recommend buying this one. Once you do, you'll venture out and buy FNF, TOC, and IB as well. This will give you a bit of a &quot;summary&quot; of the past few years. You'll be a self-proclaimed Corrs fanatic in no time! ;) <br />Inside the CD booklet, you'll see a collection of stuff from the old days, you'll also see pictures of all of the CD single covers, along with the dates of when they were released. Really cool!<br />The Corrs have stunned many with their music, and this just reminds all of us fanatics just how fantastic their career has been, and what they have given to all of us. This is a gift to us. A gift from The Corrs to the fans. Cheers! ;)
0380820846|4.0|I couldn't wait Colin's story to come out.  And while I enjoyed Colin and Penelope getting together, there seemed to be something missing.  I guess I was a little disappointed with the revelation of Mrs. Whistledown.  I couldn't quite believe Julia's choice.  But as I do love the Bridgerton series, I would recommend this to any of you who do also.  The family is ever present and helps to make up for any lack in other areas.
B000067CPX|2.0|I've been a monster Pepper fan for years but I'm very disappointed with this new CD. You would think the boys would know by now that Flea's bass is more beautiful and transcendant than all these conventional harmonies and layered vocals combined (has there ever been a bassist who conveyed so much emotion on his instrument?), but he's barely even heard here. John's a great guitarist but he tinkers way too much on this one. It's like he took the time to experiment with all these different instruments - keys, vocoder, etc. - but forgot how to play leads. His style has gotten too minimalistic for me lately, expecially in his lead playing, and he's gone overboard pushing the ubiqutious, overwrought harmonies. Flea's 'voice' just does not come through enough here. <BR> <BR>Compare \\"By The Way\\" with their masterpiece, Blood Sugar. The reason BSSM is so great (one of the reasons, anyway) is because everyone's voice comes through equally. John, Flea, Chad and Anthony weave their magik in and out, over and around, and through each other in a perfect balance, with each player taking the lead at times, and everybody playing off and complimenting the other. On BTW it sounds like Flea and Chad are merely hired guns, there to sit it the background and sheepishly comment on the dominant guitar and vocals. Of course, one can never really expect another Blood Sugar. That one simply had it all: energy, passion, funk, punk, humor, sadness, joy, delicacy, aggression, brains, muscle and iconoclasm. Then you have Californication, which is more classically structured but still retains a nice Pepper mix of understated beauty, thoughtful lyricism, and well-placed rock/funk energy. <br />\\"By The Way,\\" ultimately, is a one trick pony. Yes, it's packed full of catchy melodies and pretty hooks, but it lacks not only power (excepting the title track), but even subtlety (excepting Tear). There's a few bright spots (especially This Is the Place) and there's dashes of tasty color sprinkled here andthere on top of the cliched melodies and overwrought harmonies. But the record is simply too damn conventional. Period. This is not Chili Pepper music. I feel like they should have changed their name for this album. I'm amazed to hear myself say it, but I actually find this record boring. I heard recently that John has come to detest Mother's Milk. That's insane. The grooves on that record are downright stunning. I hope the Peppers haven't forgotten that a killer rhythm can always be as beautiful as a good melody. I've always felt close to these guys in a way, like friends really, because of the way my soul connects with their music. I think that was my biggest disappointment with BTW. It didn't happen here.<br />Anyway, the last thing I want to comment on is the unbelievable promotion this record has received. Here in NY it was constantly advertised on the radio. For a few weeks all I saw on VH1 were Pepper specials...I even noticed there was something about the Peppers on that horrific channel MTV. Now, I'm sure this album will bring many new fans into the RHCP camp, but I'm equally as sure it's going to alienate many of us who've been with them all along. For us tried-and-true fans it's not hard to do the math: mix an increasing disregard for the original Pepper style, add a progressive movement toward accesible, radio-friendly tunes, a massive dose of heavy promotion, and it all begins to smell a little bit like a sell-out. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a fan. For now anyway. The only way they could sever all ties and forever cut me loose would be to use \\"Give It Way\\" to sell cars & perform with In Sync (hey, they have some nice melodies!) at the Super Bowl. <br />Then their metamorphosis from punk-rock classics to \\"industry Joe's in a biz called show\\" would be complete, and I would be long gone.
0060976624|5.0|Fantastic!  I have read this book several times and it has never failed to have me laughing out loud.  Naylor is one of the best characters ever and I love the portrayal of the Department of Health and Human Services (Hopeless, Helpless and Stupid)---I say all this as a health care professional who works for the department (and as a liberal!).  Buckley's other books can't compare.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer's album &quot;Room For Squares&quot; is the best album I have heard in quite a while.  John's acoustic sound is somewhat similar to Dave Matthews but a little smoother, a little jazzier, and a bit quieter.  It is definitely an album that will send him to the top.  His lyrics are about his experiences and his feelings and anyone who can express themselves through their music has got my attention.  The vocals are easy to listen to and in no time you will be singing along to this album.  You can also find a lot of other music from John online including a lot of live stuff.  Take the stage John Mayer; and everyone &quot;Make Room For Squares&quot;.
B0000541VQ|5.0|This is a fanatastic film---incredible acting, riveting story, fantastic sets and costumes.  John Malkovich is amazing in his role as Valmont (his best performance ever) and Glenn Close is equally great.  I have seen this film dozens of times and never grown tired of it (the same is true of the book which I have read and re-read several times).  The book was one of Marie Antoinette's favorites and it's not hard to see why this story of court intrigue would have appealed to her.  But even for modern audiences the story has incredible appeal---twisted and distorted as the lead characters are, they are also deeply and frighteningly human.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril's Cd ROX!!!!(to start with the obvious!) When I first saw Avril on TRL a few months ago, I thought \\" wow, this song is GREAT!\\" And from then on I was hooked.  I had all my friends watch TRL to see her video, and pretty soon, they were hooked too! I bought her CD because I had a few extra bucks in my pocket, and I was sick of listening to the radio. You see, after I but a Cd I get sick of it after a while. That was so NOT the case with Avril's!! I took it home and popped it into my boom box, so I could listen to it with my friends ( they were coming over soon).  I never actually heard the door bell, cause after a  while I was blasting the Cd and singing at the top of my lungs this went on even after my friends showed up. \\" Who cares if  I don't know the words??\\" was my perogative when my best bud brought it to my attention that I was really only singing the choras. Since then, I have grown to luv every song, because there is one for esch of my moods.  When I'm annoyed, I can't go listen to something that's happy, and whne I'm happy, I can't listen to something sad or angry.  Now, what ever my mood is,I can just pick a song from her disk.  My Cd and I are attached at the hip, cause it goes every where with me ( and I do mean EVERYWHERE!) The bathroom when I shower, my friends houses  (although by now, they have gotten their own copies) in my computer when I'm online, the shore, the deck when I tan, even the kitchen when  I do the dishes!! I luv this Cd, cause it is so diverse, and so Avril.  You should totally go get it!! Buy the Cd, you wont be dissapointed!!!
B000002HPV|5.0|Possibly one of Bjork's best albums, &quot;Homogenic&quot; is packed from hard techno, to soft, light strings. It begins with Hunter's suspenseful strings (making it feel like a James Bond Movie), and a mind boggling, panning drums. Joga's great orchestra with a some twisted drum beats, and an unforgettable static-like intrumental break. Nothing special with Unravel except it's lyrics, and Bachelorette's grand strings, percussion, sound effects, and lyrics makes it one of the best songs on the CD. All Neon Like is hypnotic with a wild techno beat, and somewhat disturbing, but deep lyrics. 5 years combines distortion and stings and works very well. Immature, nothing special, but great to listen to. Alarm Call's great beats, and lyrics, makes it a great piece on the album. Pluto, great, but somewhat irritating with it's continuous screaming, but it sounds awesome with wild techno beats and effects. All Is Full Of Love, is a relieving and layed back, but the Stigmata Version/Video Version is so much better. Over all the CD is great from start to end and there isn't one song on the CD that is unlikeable.
B00005JLFC|5.0|\\"Yentl\\" is a rare film of lush ambiguities: visual, musical, sexual, spiritual. Yet Streisand is often accused of mere vanity and this film is usually cited as a prime example. The charges began as soon as the film debuted and often focused on superficial aspects such as her obvious use of eye-liner in close-ups and the Madonna (as in Mary) lighting scheme. Is there another way of looking at this? Of course. How about the tradition of female-disguised-as-male in the plays of Shakespeare and in various operas? In these works, and I think in \\"Yentl,\\" we're never supposed to forget these are women on a journey of self-discovery. They're aren't engaged in a farcical drag act meant to wow us with their persuasive gender-switch. (Men in drag on stage and in film rarely learn anything from their disguise, they're just entertaining us and themselves!; a partial exception is Dustin Hoffman in \\"Tootsie,\\" wherein he does get in touch with his inner-woman as it were). The ambiguities are the film's strength and they continue all the way through to the end (she never says she's going to America, just \\"a new land.\\" The lifesaver behind her in the boat says U.S.S.R. Departure point? Returning home from another port?) The faults are obvious (overlong, too many climaxes, an often lugubrious pace) but there isn't a classic film, American, European, or Asian that doesn't have obvious faults. Any film deserves to be judged by its strenghts. These strengths combined with the fact that it was the director's first film made under difficult circumstances makes it seem near miraculous. Europe considered it as such and awarded it accordingly. Only in her native country is Streisand still perceived as a self-reverential singer turned actress instead of the thoughtful and interesting artist on display here. Perhaps twenty years from now when the film is approaching its 40th anniversary this country will appreciate it for the passionate, deeply searching, entertainingly ambiguous, work of film-art it is.
B000002BQK|4.0|Mariah's career can be summed into two parts: before and after her divorce to Tommy Mottola. Before, she was a polished, conservative pop princess. With the release of &quot;Butterfly&quot;, she eagerly showed off her newfound independance and her new wardrobe. <br />She fulfills her longtime wish of having a more R&amp;B influenced sound by bringing in hip hop producers such as Puffy, who recreates the formula that made the &quot;Fantasy Remix&quot; a success on the opening &quot;Honey&quot;. Missy Elliot brings her slick, sassy style to &quot;Babydoll&quot;. Other hip hop-esque tracks, &quot;Breakdown&quot; and &quot;The Roof&quot;, which  are similar to the previous mentioned in the fact they create unique melodies with the background vocals. <br />&quot;Butterfly&quot; (The repeated question in interviews concerning this song: Is she or isn't she talking about her divorce?), &quot;My All&quot;, and &quot;Whenever You Call&quot; are all in the Mariah ballad tradition. This was her second album in a row where she refrains from her trademark high notes but opts for thoughtful lyrics insteads e.g from her &quot;Close My Eyes&quot;, one of the album's best tracks. The Prince remake, &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot;, featuring Sisqo of Dru Hill, starts off almost too slowly but ends in a dramatic standoff between the two singers. &quot;Outside&quot; is similar to &quot;Daydream&quot;'s final track &quot;Looking In&quot;.<br />Overall, the album is a good listen where Mariah stretches to new territory. Mariah fans should enjoy.
B000067CPX|3.0|\\"Growing Wise or Growing Stale?\\" That is the question every long-time RHCP fan must ask themselves with entertaining, but NOT exceptional \\"By the Way.\\" To imagine this chimera music you must think of a bizarre imaginary jam session between the following culprits:<BR>  \\"Dashboard Confessional\\" and \\"No Doubt\\"(sans Gwen Stefani) and a Mexican Flamenco band led by John Frusciante recorded by a tired George Martin during the studio time reserved for yet another \\"Beatles Tribute album\\" at Abbey Road studios. Rick Rubin is asleep on the couch at Warner Bros. in L.A. Anthony, Flea and Chad Smith are filming thier new MTV video somewhere else. Julian Schnabel is doodling the cover art. <br />Add all those shindigs up, stir, and release as a RHCP album.<br />  I appreciate creative growth and must congratulate the \\"red hot chili peppers\\" for turning into perhaps the world's oldest EMO band. Maybe this is due to classic rock fatigue setting in-  Vocalist Anthony Keidis, Bassist Flea, and drummer Smith are all turning fourty this year and the once teenager Frusciante is now 32 years old. Maybe RHCP forsaw rap-rock falling out of fashion and the birth of EMO and the \\"Californication\\" sound as motivation for this collection?<br />  However my money is on the CREATIVE & PRAISE WORTHY axman John Frusciante as a favourite player in the new sensitive RHCP sound. Frusciante is a sensitive guitarist and songwriter upon which much trauma has been visited(both from himself and the RHCP). Did I mention the RHCP are sensitive now? In fact in interviews they seem sensitive enough to be housebroken, despite the new disc's track \\"Throw Away your Television.\\"<br />  I can't help thinking Frusciante's associates-Flea, Anthony Kiedis,Chad Smith and producer Rick Rubin are simply expanding the \\"Under the Bridge/Soul to Squeeze/My Friends/Scar Tissue/Californication(INC.) Slow Tempo Songwriting Assembly Sweatshop\\" trademarked in the Nineties. Fan faith in Flea's talents go unreciprocated on \\"By the Way.\\" If only Flea would've took the musical reigns more in the past decade, ignoring the Peppers' favourite whipping boy job known as \\"lead guitarist\\" in thier band. Flea circa '92 could've set about expanding upon the complexity of the RHCP rythmn section...Perhaps then the music on \\"By the Way(the album)\\" would feel a little less like it took up permanent residence with Anthony \\"under the bridge, downtown\\" ...(with Julie Brown style too, I will add.)<br />  A lack of funkyness, rhythm and uneven musical direction is also often cited as the reason for weak sales of the Dave Navarro collaboration \\"One Hot minute.\\" Yet on the equally perplexing \\"By the Way\\" the band's roster is the same as during the '91 musical masterpiece(no pun intended) \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" and the mega-commerical \\"Californication.\\" Both of these Frusciante collaborations are respectable in terms of trying to reach larger audiences, while still attempting to retain the core audience ONCE attracted to the funk rock work of the '80s/EARLY'90s RHCP. \\"By the Way\\", however, entirely dispenses with the \\"Funky Monks\\" RedHotChiliPeppers SOUND in favour of a sound that could be described as the \\"'Clunky Chunks' EMO Band\\" !:-( <br />  What happened to the FUNK that inspired these guys?! Bare in mind that the RHCP rhythmn section has stayed the same since '89. DID Flea get replaced with an evil twin brother? I suspect the RHCP roosted in the hen house and laid in the pig sty a little too much in the past decade:RHCP became Funky Arena Rock Band(the sales breakthrough) in '89; Alt-Rock Band in '91(it was about the alt rock irony of seeming funky); and then ditched \\"Funky Monks\\" music for the effeminate EMO of the \\"Clunky Chunks[TM]\\" era started in '99 and essayed now on \\"By the Way.\\"<br />  The only exception to this evolution on \\"By the Way\\" are the seriously kewl rock of \\"This is the Place\\" and the \\"Warped[TM]part2-like hit MTV single\\" known as \\"By the Way.\\" Of interesting note, my local rock stationditched playing \\"By the Way\\" in favour of a pre-release mono version of \\"This is the Place.\\" New RHCP fans will gravitate toward the MTV/top40 singles and old fans toward more obcure new tracks like the deadly rock seriousness of \\"This is the Place.\\" \\"Cabron\\" being an exception to both audiences-the Peppers have created an (unfortunately late) hispanic influence in their music...Also, the ten (or twenty) years too late ska influenced \\"On Mercury\\" is another out of time oddity.<br />  One cannot help but have mixed reactions to the band's \\"post-Californication\\" sounds. Are we being challenged to accept a new direction in the old band (as in the EMO influenced \\"I Could Die for You\\" or \\"Dosed\\" or \\"Venice Queen\\" or \\"Tear\\")? Are we being handed (by the Peppers&producer Rubin) sure fire hits like the title track pastiche \\"By the Way\\" or (Beach Boys like) \\"Minor Thing\\"? Something like a cross between these two extreme affairs seems the product of \\"By the Way\\"-a spasmodically combined song writing style with the Peppers newest influences on show. This disc by former funk rockers is at least a commendable attempt to take popular rock in directions away from Rap-Rock/Hard Rock excesses. In this music the RHCP steered clear of the psychotic aesthetics of macho nu-metal where the accounting firm of Rubin, Kiedis, Balzary, Frusciante & Smith could ca$h in e-a-s-i-l-y. An Intriguing if misguided Album for long time RHCP fans, newcomers, and teenage EMO fans alike. Buy iT If you dare- recommended b/c even average RHCP songs tend to grow on me. \\"By the Way\\" is for the wise(?), stale(.), and still growing(!)
B000063UR2|4.0|Ok, I'm not too sure how to explain this edition.  First of all, if you didn't like the orig. U.S. release, this version prob. won't change your mind.  The Directors Cut (which I believe is the &quot;original version&quot; released in other countries) is quite a bit different.  I am a big fan of the U.S version, and unlike alot of people I very much prefere the Tangerine dream soundtrack.  It isn't that Goldsmiths is not good, but after seeing the movie one way about 100 times, it's hard to adjust to something as major as a different musical score!<BR>     Also, alot of people complain about movies being &quot;dumbed down&quot; for U.S. audiences.  Well, unlike the Blade Runner fiasco, in this case I think it was a good idiea. The extra footage and dialouge in the directors cut really only slows down the overall pace of the movie.  Some of the actors lines and expressions just seem out of place, also, even changing the way you think about that character. (The &quot;princess&quot; seems downright arrogant at times...)<BR>     So, with all these down points, why 4 stars?  As I said, I loved the orig. U.S. version and it's here!  If you liked it, I would still suggest you get this DVD.  Give the D.C. a look, then enjoy the version we love.  It's loaded with extras, too!
B000051VWW|5.0|THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS CD!  IT IS SADE'S BEST BY FAR. EVERY TRACK IS GREAT.  I NEVER GET TIRED OF LISTENING TO IT
B0000508U6|5.0|I heard of Coldplay through my boyfrien (now husband) who is from England.  I fell in love straight away - and I am a rap and R&B lover!!!  I was surprised when I saw how young the lead singer is.  Because he has such insight in life.  His voice is angelic, like I said above.  And his songs are addictive.  They can make you feel so happy to be alive, and they can make you cry - especially if you find a time in your life where you identify with him.  Absolutely gorgeous, music.  Totally brilliant and beautiful.  A totally amazing favorite of mine - and not just a few songs on his album... ALL of them are great.
B00000253N|2.0|I am trying to appreciate the creativity and imagery of Bob Dylan. Whereas I do admire the atmospherics on such cuts as Your A Big Girl Now and Tangled Up In Blue, too many of these songs are excessively long winded. Heck that Jack of Hearts number must have twelve or thirteen verses all at the same pace with absolutely no change in instrumental definition. This is oh so grating.<br />Also annoying is Bob Dylan's voice on several songs. Some people may find Idiot Wind to be an emotional performance. And the lyrics are indeed quite good in that vein. However, Dylan is so off key in many instances that it is a really pain to listen to especially over the course of seven and a half minutes.<br />In general many of these songs are overlong and way too repetitive. Way too many verses which just don't do anything special for me most of the time. I know Dylan's aim was to return to his acoustic roots. However, the lack of an electric presence on more than the bluesy Meet Me In The Morning just hold this CD back.<br />Tangled Up In Blue is a pretty cool song, Meet In The Morning has some nice guitar, and some of the other tunes have good atmospherics. However, I prefer other recordings by Mr. Zimmerman such as Blond On Blonde, Nashville Skyline, and The Basement Tapes.<br />...
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie was a must see for any age. Great for kids to stimulate their imagination and great for adults to wake up imaginations that may have been asleep for some time. The acting is surprisingly good for new young actors and the setting is amazing it feels so real. Don't miss this one. It's worth the usual $20 for a DVD and I rarely spend that much on any movie
B00005JKQZ|5.0|The film A Beautiful Mind is one of much aptitude and anticipation which give this movie a commendable score of nine points out of a feasible ten. The movie manages to twist enough pathos out of John Nash's inconceivable life story to redeem an at-times ludicrous representation of schizophrenia. This film has a large amount of decisive factors that formulate this film to be consequently astonishing. The initial portion of criterion facilitated in this film is its significant performing of the actors. Russell Crowe tackles the role with distinguishing vehemence, in performance of the Nobel prize-winning mathematician from his days at Princeton, where he developed an innovative economic theory. The job made by Crowe is nothing abrupt of immaculateness. Jennifer Connelly outrivals in her role as the accommodating wife, with inconsequential reservations. The acting alone makes this film so immaculate, excluding the acting; there is much that substantiates this film wonderful.<BR> Subsequently, the captivating and inimitable chronicle of the life of John Nash augments the immensity of the film. In the commencement the audience's assessment of the film is scrutiny of a gifted man attending Princeton, who desires to formulate an exalted concept. This by itself is a nonchalant movie; on the contrary the story that is unfolded constructs this to be an irreplaceable story. A first time watcher would not distinguish Nash's schizophrenia and that particular characters do not in reality subsist, as soon as ascertaining this mental mannerism about him it makes you reflect, and accordingly makes the viewer watch it for a second time. If you has not seen this film, it is vastly recommended that it be seen and be taken in by the film's satirical intellect and innovation.
B000067CPX|5.0|After listening to the album By the Way by the Red hot Chili Peppers about 3 or 4 times in the day and a half, I have come to the conclusion that we have on our hands a bonafide classic! These guys have found in the last two albums a heart and soul that people knew were there, but did not know that it would be this great! For instance, take the song Cabron. I just can't believe that there was a little folk-world music in them. It is definitely very positive, and I was a little taken aback when I heard it, but blew me away!<BR>Not much Rapping, and not much Funk, but who cares, they know that they are the grandfathers of Modern Rock and they just went and did something totally from the heart! The first single <BR>By the Way is definitely an odd choice for a single, but it is adventurous, and enjoyable!  The song Minor Thing is a great stab at a pop song and shame on them if it is not a hit!! john Fruiscante has stepped up his guitar playing a couple of notches, and Flea... well, you know! Anthony just keeps getting better and better as a singer! Definitely a must for anyone  who is a fan or has discovered them for the first time! Please Enjoy!
B00005YW4H|5.0|We are in the midst of an office war over who gets to play this cd.  Norah's smooth, soulful voice is in high demand.  Why am I on Amazon writing this review?  I logged in because I need to order several more of this amazing, timeless cd!  I saw Norah Jones in concert....  Simply extraordinary.
6305291446|3.0|There are two ways you can view Halloween H20. Number One: Forget that Halloween 4-6 were ever made, and believe that Halloween 1-2 are the only existing ones. This would make for an enjoyable horror movie. At times, H20 has a bit of the same feel of the original and its sequel, but an updated feel to it. Michael is a bit more brutal here, but it was the 90's and the Scream phase was going on. Jamie Lee Curtis is as strong as ever as Laurie Strode, and plays off her \\"near the brink of insanity\\" persona very well. The final showdown -- er -- showdown between her and Michael in the school is a very tense and good setup. The acting from the supporting characters is very acceptable. Especially that of Josh Hartnett. <br /> Now, let's see it from my second viewpoint. In Halloweens 4-6, Laurie Strode supposedly had another child. Jamie Strode, and it was these 3 films that focused on Michael trying to kill her. He finally managed to do so in part 6, but not before she also had a child. And what about the whole Thorn occult deal that Michael is linked to? This is what upsets me about the Halloween series in general, it didn't keep up with its continuity. And with Halloween Resurrection's release, they even space themselves more with discontinuity by completely ignoring Laurie's son, John (Josh Hartnett). Read my Halloween Resurrection review for more on what I have to say.<br /> When I do watch H20 (And I do occasionally because it's entertaining), I try to set my movie-mind with the fact that there is no Halloween 4-6, and that this is only the third entry in the series. I at least enjoy it better when I think that.
B000067CPX|4.0|...and I think this is sort of what's happening with the 'Peppers.  For me, this is not necessarily a bad thing and actually kind of fits. As a long-time RHCP listener who tuned in  during the early stages (Mother's Milk, Freaky Styley, etc.), I can remember when that funked-up, posturing type of testosterone spoke loudly to me. While By the Way is still decidely RHCP in flavor, I'm hearing more thought and musical maturity here. High-profile musicians get ragged on all the time for &quot;selling out&quot; (and we all know that some bands deserve it), but I don't think that's the case here. I could be wrong, but I think these guys have grown and are ok with showing that; perhaps they can't necessarily relate to a song like &quot;Johnny Kick a Hole in the Sky&quot; or &quot;Stone Cold Bush&quot; anymore as well as they can to some of the newer music they've produced with this album, but that's sort of how I feel too. It sounds tighter to me than Californication in ways, harmonious and free-flowing in others and not too radio friendly (a good thing, as a good portion of radio seems to bite these days.). I look at this as an evolution for these guys, not a cop out. So until they turn to half-time duets with N-Sync and Britney Spears, I'll keep listening.

B000068QY7|5.0|Everybody should purchase this album.  Oasis is back in a major way!!  Album of the year candidate.
B000067CPX|1.0|as a long time fan of RHCP, I waited in great anticipation for this new release. upon first listen, I couldn't believe what they've turned into. By the Way is a regurgitation of their old sappy ballads (such as Under the Bridge) mixed with a few spacey sound effects. it's like the RHCP strapped on knee and elbow pads, buckled on a helmet, and took a bunch of prescription ibuprofen before jumping into the mosh pit of album writing. the music is weak, not at all unique, and the lyrics are horrible. please, do not spend your money on this.
B00004U2G4|5.0|I bought this album almost 20 years after it was first released and I was blown away!First on record in the mid eighties and later on cd,It's still my favorite Beck recording.I had all his stuff with the Yardbirds,so I was curious where he went from there.Orginially he was going to form a supergroup with Jimmy Page,John entwistle,and at the core-The late great Keith Moon on drums,who you can hear screaming in the middle of Becks Bolaro.Moon actually came up with the name Led Zeppelin and this is the album Page nicked alot of his ideas from Beck.Listen to this album and then the first Zeppelin album and you'll see what I mean,and Truth came out a full year before.Plus you get geat bass playing from Ron Wood,terrific vocals by Rod Stewart,intense dumming by Micky Waller,and the late Nicky Hopkins on keys,And Keith Moon on timpini[credited as you know who] on Old Man River,and of course Jeff Beck on guiter.This album influenced almost every hard rock band of the seventies and beyond,a must buy!
B00004TLMC|4.0|Watching the cinematography and the pacing, I am taking back to other Kubrick films like \\"2001\\" and \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\"  The overall feel of uneasiness reminded me a lot of the latter.<br />This is a very sexual movie, and the conflict lies in sexual impropriety.  Oddly enough, the two protagonists, Cruise and Kidman, never have sex with anyone besides each other (and they are married).  The conflict is more in the mental act of being unfaithful, real or imagined.  The whole idea of the \\"unreality\\" of the whole situation is what Kubrick shows so well here.  It is unsettling.<br />Since there are drug and dream elements of the film, conversations seem to take a longer time than necessary.  It helps the ambience of the film, but I found myself waiting for Nicole to finish her sentence.  No one seems to believe what he or she hears (or sees) as evidenced by a constant questioning.  <br />I would recommend this to Stanley Kubrick fans and any one wanting to watch a master director at work.  I would not recommend this for casual viewing.
B00005NWM3|1.0|I try to be an optimist with alot of things. When I hear music that I can't particularly relate to, I usually just pass it off and at least appreciate the artistic integrity and the vision of the person writing the music, and then I just come to the realization that I can't see eye to eye with the songwriter. As hard as I try I can't do this with anything this band has written. <br />Every song I heard on this album sounds so much the same, I can't help but wonder whether these guys have ever taken a step back from what they were doing and looked at it from an alternative perspective and thought \\"wow......we really ...!\\"<br />This music is the epitomy of poolhall music that you are seamlessly able to ignore during it's entirety. To think that 4 or 5 guys all got together, wrote these banal contraptions disguised as music, and none of them had a secret plot to murder the other band members will forever baffle me. <br />I would go so far as to ask their record company to take their record off the shelves forever, just as a kind incentive to keep musicians and composers (with ACTUAL TALENT) feeling a little more faithful about furthering their own music careers.<br />If I ever got to meet these guys in person, I wouldn't say anything to them.
B000059HGY|4.0|There are elements of the movie that left me a little bothered.  Foremost was the subtitles (the Japanese actors speak their own language rather than English) were white which oftentimes appeared with a white background (the navy uniforms).  This was frustrating when trying to really follow the story.  Another element was the constant change of location and players, which made it difficult to keep up with who knew what and when.<br />In retrospect, these elements contributed to my enjoyment of the film.  Although the scenes of the Pearl Harbor attack were horrific, the bulk of the film concerns the events leading up to that fateful day.  The seemingly haphazardness of this film helped me feel the chaos and miscommunication occurring on both sides of the battlefield.  All the mistakes made by both sides show lessons to be learned; for example, the ignoring of the new radar contact showing a large mass approaching Hawaii, the delay by requesting for confirmation on the sinking of Japanese submarine close to Pearl Harbor, and wish to not alarm the high-ranking officials.<br />I found this to be a great film, but if you do not have a good idea of who the players and events were at Pearl Harbor in 1941, you may find yourself lost.
B000066NW0|5.0|Never in my life have I ever come across a female singer to make it in the rock world at such a young age- 17 years old. This is a very refreshing cd, especially after an overload of pop music in the music industry over the last couple of years. Don't get me wrong...pop is good music. But too much pop (especially young teenage girl sugar sweet pop) gets annoying. Avril Lavigne, in my opinion, is a very promising singer, and she definitely has what it takes to make it in the music industry. I bought this cd recently, and it is by far one of my favorite cd's in my whole collection. With some loud songs, some fast toe-tappers, and even a few slow, inspirational songs, this cd is a must-buy. If you haven't bought this cd yet, let alone listen to any of her songs, I urge you to buy this cd; you won't be sorry.
B0000636UN|4.0|Although not up to the standard of her eclectic, trad-rock masterpiece &quot;Sheryl Crow,&quot; &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; is definitely an improvement over the tedious &quot;Globe Sessions.&quot;  &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; keeps the listener interested with a variety of moods, tempos, and studio effects, and should solidify Sheryl Crow's reputation as one of America's best contemporary roots rockers.<br />That said, the album is not without its weak moments.  Ms. Crow virtually shouts the refrain to &quot;You're an Original,&quot; presumably in an attempt to force some life into an uninteresting song (and Lenny Kravitz's harmony vocal actually makes matters worse).  And she would have done better with one or two fewer ballads.  (Like many contemporary artists, she seems to feel a need to fill up the CD, even if she only has 40 minutes of great material.)<br />All in all, &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; is a semi-classic.
B000068OCS|5.0|I haven't looked in the thesaurus yet, but I'm sure it lists no synonym for 'joy' that comes CLOSE to how glad I am that this is now available. Koyanisqaatsi is easily in my top ten list. That being said, I've only seen it ONCE!!<br />Having been a Philip Glass fan for some time, I came across the first release of the soundtrack a few years ago, while studying at Berklee College of Music. Mesmerized, I spent a few weeks anxiously looking for a video store with a copy. There must've been many anxious viewers before me, because the cassette was worn quite thin due to age and repeated viewing.  Owing to the weak cassette, the picture and sound were a solid C. The mood, cinematography, music and effect, though, were an easy A inching towards an A+. Although I saw the film 4 years ago, I can't get the NYC climax followed by the challenger 'release' out of my memory.<br />There've been a few films that have trid to measure up through immitation (the speed shots, no dialogue, hollywoods take on 'minimalism') but Koyanisqaatsi was the first. If you truly want to experience what art can be, buy it, watch it and repeat.
B000067CPX|5.0|First off, let's get one thing clear: this is not a typical Chili Peppers album.  If you're looking for another Blood Sugar Sex Magik, don't bother.  However, if you're a true Peppers fan, and have a genuine appreciation for really good music, you'll love it.  The guys have really broadened the horizons, and come up with some truly beautiful songs.  The first title track off the album follows the traditional Peppers blueprint: fast, frantic, and driven.  From then on, things get a little different.  Most of the songs are slower, and much more melodic than anything they've ever done before.  But hey, faster isn't always better.  It all seems like new territory for the band, but it'll knock you on your butt.  To really stir things up, they've written songs like \\"On Mercury\\", which is a great recipe comprised of funk, swing, and regae, and \\"Cabron\\" which is basically a Pepper's take on salsa music.  I think it's probably my favorite track off the album.  <BR>     Overall, I love it.  It came out yesterday, and I've already gone through it about four times.  Go get it, keep an open mind, and just kick back and enjoy some great songs.  Pure and simple.

0441172717|4.0|This book is not the best book ever written.  Nor is it the most exciting or intriguing story.  It is however a modern classic that envelops the reader in a different universe where the problems we have today -- politics, business evils and shortage of natural resources -- are mirrored in a fantastical realm.<br />The main character is good. The antagonists are bad.  For the most part, there is not much &quot;gray&quot;.  Like a western of old, the hats are easy to recognize.  I read this book twenty years ago and recently picked it up again from the local used book store.  I found that it was still as fun to read as it was long ago.<br />Read this book because it is a modern classic.  Enjoy the ride.
6304925131|3.0|Matt Damon still lights up the movie screen with his incredible talent as an actor, but he couldnt show it all as he was held down by this some-what dull plot.  Good movie with great acting and well thought out problem, but slow moving action scenes.
B000065U6O|4.0|I had to struggle to collect my thoughts after watching Leni Riefenstahl's infamous propaganda film.  What can one say about it?  Riefenstahl presents Hitler and the Nazi Party in a benign and glorified light and almost makes you want to be a part of it.  You find yourself being sucked into the images and crowds and cheering on the Nazis.  Then the film is finished and reality sets in.  Riefenstahl claims to this day that this is simply an art film, not a political or propaganda film.  But every shot of Triumph of the Will suggests a woman infatuated with her subject; Hitler and Nazism.<br />The shots of thousands of soldiers marching in unison is both stunning and terrifying.  The close-up shots of expressionless soldiers standing at attention are frightening and disturbing.  You think to yourself, 'nobody's home'.  Even more disturbing are shots of children standing in the streets waving, parents holding up their children so they can see the parade.  These children will be exposed to Nazi ideals, inducted into Hitler's youth, trained as soldiers, molded into racists, murderers, in other words into good little Nazis who will sacrifice themselves for their country.<br />Ironically, although this is considered to be a great propaganda film, the weakest parts are the scenes where Hitler gives his speeches.  No amount of camera work can disguise the fact that this man is insane.  He gives speaches about crushing the red menace and Germany's enemies.  He calls for peace while also calling for courage and loyalty to one's country.  He claims the German people are in favour with God and equates God with Nazism.  He claims that the Third Reich will last for a thousand years when in fact it will only last for twelve.  And this is after Riefenstahl has edited 115 minutes from a 2 hour speech.<br />Many Germans and Austrians who lived through the Nazi era claim that they did not support Hitler, or that they were helpless to resist him, or that they did not know what the Naziswere up to.  But it's pretty clear from this film that most Germans DID support Hitler and that most supported him eagerly.  Riefenstahl herself claims to have been ignorant about what Hitler was up to.  If Hitler's favorite filmmaker did not know what Hitler was up to then who did?  One wonders how many present day Germans who seem like nice people have skeletons in their closets.
B00005Q3TZ|4.0|Director Bay kept his powder dry on the initial Commemorative Edition of \\"Pearl Harbor\\" that came out Memorial Day 2001, saving the real DVD firepower for this Fourth of July. Bay's latest campaign has produced the most ambitious DVD set to date. \\"Pearl Harbor: The Director's Cut\\" is made for people who are serious about film, art, technology and/or war. It's packed with special effects breakdowns, historical insight, full-length commentaries, interviews with survivors and a maze of other extras. There's a movie in here somewhere, but those seeking the popcorn experience should go with the original DVD. The stunning audio and video are at least as good on the 2001 release; most people won't be able to tell a lot of content has been crammed onto the movie discs.<br /> Bay recut the film to add more realistic combat footage (mostly gore) and to remove some of the sappier moments (what he calls \\"earnest dialogue\\"). The changes -- including a shot of a severed head rolling around on a ship -- probably won't change anyone's opinion of the movie. \\"I always wanted to shoot (it as) an R-rated film,\\" Bay says.<br />An interactive breakdown of the 27-minute attack sequence (on Disc 4) allows viewers to watch animatics or storyboards while comparing them to shots of the crew filming and the finished product. Several commentaries cover the attack section, including one with effects supervisor Eric Brevig. The audio also can be manipulated to isolate the sound effects and music. A fun featurette shows the actors going through a hurry-up boot camp with real drill sergeants at an Army base, with Affleck looking particularly miserable and a game Baldwin providing a slow-moving target.<br /> The DVD set's historical content includes a fascinating documentary on U.S.-Japanese relations that covers several hundred years. The docu, unfortunately, was chopped up to fit a graphic timeline format that yanks viewers out of the narrative.
B000002KGT|5.0|&quot;Rumours&quot; is a classic.  Fleetwood Mac has never sounded better than they do on this album, a collection of 11 pop-rock gems that sound just as good today as they did twenty-five years ago.  Evoking sunshiney California and the bohemia of the 1970s with their solid vocals and poignant lyrics, FM proves here that they are one of the finest musical groups to ever take the stage.  &quot;Rumours&quot; is an album you can sing along to and never get tired of.
B000002OVJ|5.0|John Entwistle, the usually quiet but ultimately thunderous bass player from The Who, died of a heart attack recently at the age of 57.  He was truly one of the greatest and most talented bassists of all time, inspiring many subsequent bass players.  He had a sound that was like no other before - a thick, heavy, dense, and fat sound that was blazingly intense especially for a player who always stood still at every Who concert while the other three guys go off on stage.  The only other players at the time who matched his heavy sound were Chris Squire of Yes, Geddy Lee of Rush, and Geezer Butler of Black Sabbath.  You can't really compare them, but Entwistle's influence on their style(s) is undeniable, even if he isn't a 'real' influence on their playing.<br />If you've seen any report on Entwistle's death, sure enough the journalist mentioned that the Who's 1970 live masterpiece LIVE AT LEEDS was the best album to hear his playing in full force.  They're absolutely right.  Entwistle speeds up and down, up and down his basslines as if his life depended on it - not that there's anything wrong with that.  The whole band is in top form at this legendary performance, but Entwistle definitely stands out the most.<br />I own the 14-track remaster from 1995, not the double-disc concert that was released earlier this year.  It's tough to pick Entwistle's best performance during the show, but I would have to say it's \\"Young Man Blues\\" (track 5).  Buy this album just to hear this track alone.  The whole band is on fire and there's Entwistle, picking the bass strings so hard - and fast!- that I'm surprised they didn't snap off.  His other standout performances include the killer basslines for \\"Heaven & Hell\\" (a song he wrote himself) and \\"I Can't Explain,\\" the rickety bass riff for \\"I'm a Boy,\\" and the classic bass solo from the \\"Amazing Journey/Sparks\\" medley.<br />Overall, Entwistle was a remarkable talent.  He may not get the same respect that Daltrey, Townshend, and Moon get, but he's certainly deserves a lot of it.  It's stupid that Daltrey and Townshend are continuing to go on tour as \\"The Who.\\"  The real Who has been dead ever since Keith Moon passed away in 1978.  Now, with Entwistle gone, it's time for the remaining two members to put out the flame, stop milking money from the band's legacy, and move on.  Plain and simple.
0061008079|5.0|The &quot;Woman of Substance,&quot; and the other sequels following it are wonderful works! The story is based upon the poor Emma, who is a poverty-stricken child, living in rags, and yet comes out of it a wonderful young adult, working her way to empireship with her store business across the country. She works her fingers to the bone to achieve her goals, is a formidable woman, and always gets what she sets out to accomplish through her relentless perserverance. A worthwhile read, and VERY HARD to put it down once you get into the story!

6304479697|5.0|The \\"Special Edition\\" DVD of the 1970 concert film, \\"That's the way it is\\",is remastered with better audio, video, and extra footage of Elvis!  It has removed footage from the original VHS version (which has a cover showing Elvis in a flowered shirt) such as fan comments, advertising for the show, and even a few Elvis performances (\\"I just can't help believing\\" for one). This documentary consists of footage of Elvis in one of the best times of his life emotionally, physically, and vocally.  Seriously, the band has to work hard to keep up with the energy that Elvis displays in this show! (see \\"Polk Salad Annie\\", \\"Suspicious Minds\\", etc.) It is fantastic that this video has been preserved because it shows Elvis at the top of his game.  You may notice that the audience is quite tame compared to an arena audience.  For one thing the concert is a formal Vegas affair with everyone seated at dining tables.  Yes there are still some lovesick girls in the front row, but you can also see celebrities like Sammy Davis, jr. and Cary Grant in attendance.  The energy of the audience doesent really matter anyway because the performance Elvis gives is amazing and inspiring.  This is a great way to remember Elvis.<br />The DVD will sound, look, and flow much better than the original film.  It also has more Elvis and less stuff to fast foward through.  Bottom line: Hold on to your old VHS copy for the performances not on the DVD, but buy the DVD for every other reason.<br />TCB
B00003CX95|5.0|A branch of my family tree from way way back is from Scotland.  When I see this movie and hear the wonderful soundtrack I can't help but feel the same stiring in my blood as my ansestors once did all those years ago.  <br />Wonderful battle sceans and some good reflections on life make this movie one of my personal picks.  If you enjoy a story that has war, love and treachery all in one you should see this movie.  By the end you will think that Mel Gibbson is Braeheart.

Well, I was WRONG!<br />This movie has more twists than you expect, and it's twisty right from the start.  The book (by the way) is excellent as well, and the movie does a great job sticking to the plot of the book.  I saw the movie first, then read the book, and I could not get Ed Norton's voice out of my head, they're THAT close.<br />It makes you think, it makes you jumpy, it makes you want to go make soap, and perhaps blow something up.  Mostly it makes you think.  And maybe watch it, oh, seventy times more so you can catch everything.<br />P>Do yourself a favor, WATCH THIS MOVIE!  You *will* like it, I promise.  I've forced dozens of people to watch this, and each one liked it.  Even my MOM liked it, and she's even more anti-everything than I am!...<br />(And no, this isn't a \\"guy\\" movie.

Never thought Obi Won could sing like that.  A great soundtrack full of variety that will not get tiresome.  Wish all CD's could be this way.
B000067CPX|4.0|Every time I hear this album, the word that keeps popping into my mind is mature.  It's definitely a more cultivated version of these four men.  Anthony's lyrics are intelligent and thoughtful, and Flea, John, and Chad are really cohesive together, no one person overriding the others.  You can tell that they've been playing together for a long time, and you can hear some of the things that they've all gone through together.  Stylistically the album is pretty diverse, there isn't a whole lot of the \\"old school Peppers\\" that we're used to hearing.  There's not a lot of outright sex going on, although there is still a sexual charge, especially in Don't Forget Me.  More noticeable is a level of awareness and tenderness in songs like I Would Die for You.  Notably lacking is the Parental Advisory Explicit Lyrics sticker.  If there are explicit lyrics, I haven't found them yet.   The musical range of the band is in evidence here, from the more recognizable sounds of Pepper past on the title track, to the Latin-based sounds on Cabron, to everything in between.  The thing that strikes me the most though, is that while it's certainly more mature, more thoughtful and more mellow, it hasn't lost that essential Red Hot flavor.  If you haven't gotten it, I'd recommend it.

0792844890|5.0|\\"Spaceballs\\" is one of the funniest movies ever made! The DVD is great! The picture and sound quality are fabulous. There are a few extras including the Special Behind The Scenes Footage, which is great, except the DVD needs more special features like outtakes, production photographs, deleted scenes, and others. Mel Brooks stars as President Skroob who sends Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis) to steal Planet Druidia's air supply and save Spaceball City, but Lone Starr (Bill Pullman) and his friend Barf (John Candy) are here to stop it. Princess Vespa has to marry a prince, but she did not want to marry Prince Valium because she was not in love with him. Dick Van Patten is terrific in his supporting role as King Roland, Princess Vespa's father. George Wyner is also great as Colonel Sandurz and Joan Rivers is also good as the voice of Dot Matrix. \\"Spaceballs\\" is a movie you should own on DVD, if you own a DVD player. My brother likes it, too.
B00005JKMQ|2.0|Last December this movie was a big disappointment both for the critics than the box office: I think it was unavoidable since Ali is a character too big and multifaceted to be reduced to a movie. Will Smith performance is impressive and Michael Mann's techinque filming the boxing matches works well because it gives you the sensation of being on the ring: maybe this movie could appeal to someone who hasn't read books about Ali, nor seen documentaries, however in such a case I suggest you read Remnick's \\"King of the world\\" and watch Gast's \\"When we were Kings\\".<BR>This DVD edition is a barebone one: the video is honest, no state of the art here; the 5.1 DD audio track is good but no much surround effects here.
B00004W19V|3.0|I was looking for the \\"Short Circuit\\" DVD in every video store in my area, but I could not find it in any of them. So I purchased it from Amazon.com and I was happy that I got it, but the picture quality has a very little problem, but the sound quality is OK and the features are fine. Ally Sheedy is good in her role as Stephanie Speck, a young lady who loves animals. She befriends the Johnny 5 robot from her truck. Steve Guttenberg and Fisher Stevens are terrific here, too. If you have not seen \\"Short Circuit\\", see it. And if you liked it, buy it. I think you will not be disappointed.
B000067CPX|5.0|Most RHCP fans know that Blood Sugar Sex Magik is an incredible album. Well, this CD doesn't even come close to it, however, it is their second best CD in my opinion. Definatly worth 5 stars. The CD is not like Blood Sugar Sex Magik, it continues down the road of the mediocre Californication, but it's much better. Californication had maybe 6 good songs. On By the Way, every song is good, here are my ratings.<br />By the Way - A-<BR>A good song, but tends to get old after a long time. It is the only song on the CD that comes close to capturing the BSSM attitude however with its funky bass and rap lines.<br />Universally Speaking - A-<BR>Probably the one you will skip over, it would have been much better placed near the ending of the album, however, it is a very good song, and sounds fresh an original if you are in the right mood for it.<br />This is the Place - A+<BR>One of my personal favorites, this song rocks pretty hard without any funky rap, in vein of maybe easily form califronication, but it also sounds very fresh and new, and the guitar near the end sounds very amazing yet simple.<br />Dosed - A+<BR>One of RHCP's better slow songs, its no Under the Bridge of I Could Have Lied, but better than anything on Californication. It has a nice guitar and many layers making it sound very rich, and it has deep, powerful lyrics as well.<br />Don't Forget Me - B<BR>This song is kind of slow, kind of fast, but I would call it a slow song. It doesn't sound very well to have a mediocre slow song right after an excellant one like Dosed, so you will probably be skipping it often, though I like the lyrics alot.<br />The Zepher Song - A+<BR>Third slow song in a row, but it is way more upbeat than the previous ones. This is very poppy, but I would say it is better than Dosed, bascically a wide open song that will make you think of wide open things.<br />Can't Stop - A<BR>This is another heavy fast song. It's almost rap, but definatly not the standard RHCP funk-rap. It is nice tohear ten experiment, as this and all the songs on this record sound very different, but not too different like OHM.<br />I Could Die For You - B+<BR>Great slow song, but not as good as Zepher or Dosed, and not as good lyrics either.<br />Midnight - A+<BR>Another hard rocker that is slow at times. This is another reminder of how much I love this CD. I escpecially like the orchestra at the beginning suddenly turing into a moddy guitar with wierd sound effects, its great.<br />Throw Away Your Television - C+<BR>This is an ok song, but I dislike the techno influences. There is virtually no guitar, the lyrical tune pretty much sucks, but the drums and bass bring this song up just beyond average.<br />Cabron - A<BR>I never knew John Fruciante was that good. It sure sounds hard to play. This song features a Led Zeppelin sounding guitar, with a Latino beat and very upbeat lyrics.<br />Tear - A+<BR>Another slow song, its as good if not better than Dosed and Zepher. You will probably like it, not much more to say.<br />On Mercury - A-<br />This is interesting. It is not that badm but doesn't sound like something they would do. This is a ska song and I don't like ska - RHCP have an ability too make genres you don't really like likable, I don't like rap, punk or funk either, unless they do it.<br />Minor Thing - A+<BR>A good song that completely rocks out the whole way through. I think it's about baseball. It is one of the best on the CD.<br />Warm Tape - B<BR>I don't like this as much, the sound effect in beginning sounds like old nintendo music, but the chorus is pretty good sounding like classic rock, its not that bad of a song.<br />Venice Queen - This song is dark and moody and pretty good, a nice ending to the CD.<br />Overall, this CD is vey different for them, as they get progressively slower, mellower, cleaner and mature. Gone are the days of \\"Sex Rap\\" and Sir Phyco Sexy\\" but that's not necssassarly a bad thing. If you only like Blood Sugar Sex Magik and can't toleratethe slower songs they do don't get this, otehrwise, whether you like them, or you don't, buy this CD, you won't be disappionted.
0684857820|5.0|Alice Sebold's Lucky offers a stark window onto the strains and suffering of rape.  Sebold's sharp prose, blunt honesty, and rather black sense of humor give the reader that rare feeling of stepping into an author's skin.  Where others would shy away, she offers vivid, often horifying picture so that we can know the brutality she suffered.  Most importantly, I did not get a sense she was rewriting the history of her attack and her reaction, but rather like she was opening up a journal of dark times.  <br />Though at times a hard trip, readers will certainly grow from the experience of reading this work.  I urge those interested to read it.
B000067CPX|5.0|Now, some people might say that RHCP are selling out, abondinging the wild, innovative funk-rock on their first few releases that made them superstars. But really, how else would you want them to age? Rather, they've made a beautiful, weathered album that maintains the energy of the first 4 records and keeps them on the path of maturity that they've been on since Blood Suger Sex Magik. The Peppers demonstrate range and guts on By The Way, as well as first-class musicianship that only gets better! Anthony Kiedis has always been a good lyricist, but his rhyming skills have reached a new level. Frusciante is all over the place and proves that, as great as Hilel Slovak and Dave Navarro were, he is the definitive Peppers guitarist. Flea and Chad Smith's rhythm section has always been among the strongest in rock, but their songwriting has reached a new level of beauty on tracks like \\"This is the Place,\\" \\"Midnight,\\" and \\"Tear.\\" Yet all the tracks on this album hold their own, and this is a lovely piece of art...
B00005YXZH|5.0|This record is stunning - possibly among the finest pieces of modern American music.  It is hard to explain why it is so good, though.  Folks who look for catchy pop will find this album formulaic and increasingly dull with each listen.  Folks who look for way-out-there craziness will find this a pathetic effort given all the other electronic tweaking and Beefheartian possibilities being explored today.  Folks who are committed to an underground or an indie or an obscurantist groove (e.g., Chilton-heads) will see this as just more evidence of \\"Summerteeth\\" sell-out from Tweedy & Co.  But, those of us who are willing to listen carefully and really engage the music - those of us who are not necessarily wedded to some sort of musical ideology - will find this album ceaselessly rewarding.  The songs get at something - a certain longing, a certain glee, a certain confusion - without being sophomoric musings in the key of G (yeah - lots of G on this record - it's true).  Tweedy never reaches when he sings - but he is not lazy either.  Like a good actor who knows that a little twitch above the eye or lean of the head is better at getting across emotion than an outburst, Tweedy hits the mark just enough when singing.  It really feels like you are sitting with a good friend and just rapping.  But, this is not enough to make it a great album.  The music itself - so simple and direct - has a scrambled edge to it that keeps it from becoming just another example of a stale genre.  Rather, the music spreads out and fills out the room (or wherever).  The music feels like a peculiar and slightly awkward emotional response to everyday events.  It is not spectacle - something people inexplicably still long for after 9/11 - it is rather music that reflects a very confident but perhaps too-intellgent person's confusion about what to make of the world before him or her.  This music is meant to be savored and felt - it is not a quick one off.  I have been a Tupelo fan for almost a decade and, for the first time, I will say it: Tweedy and co. have moved far out of the shadow of Tupelo.  Congrats, Jeff... and thanks.and, for the first time, I will say it: Tweedy and co. have moved far out of the shadow of Tupelo.  Congrats, Jeff... and thanks.

B0000524E5|5.0|very cool and touching movie. Not at all what you would<br />think from the title. I loved it. Buying it so we can<br />watch it again and again. It is one of my favorite<br />movies along with Matrix and the first part of<br />Blade. Go figure that one out if you dare.<br />Try it. I think you will love it. We did. My wife<br />and I both thought this move was very cool. Good mix<br />of dance, singing, drama and love with some comedy<br />thrown in too. And a few surprises along the way.

0767906543|5.0|While reading this book, I often found myself laughing out loud. This book is truly enjoyable. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for some light and funny reading.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|The Beatles were running on fumes during the second half of '67, so the two earliest tracks here, \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields,\\" are conspicuously the best. Only \\"I Am the Walrus\\" among the post-'Pepper' tracks rises to similar heights. A collection of TV-movie songs padded out with a few singles, this may be the group's worst album. Nevertheless it's a masterpiece.    The three songs mentioned above are of such surpassing greatness they damn near carry the album all on their own. What the other songs lack in vision and intensity they make up for in simple mastery.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I think that Requiem for a Dream was one of the most amazing drama's i've ever seen. It was weird and interesting and just so overwhelming with strangeness which i loved. It's definatly a movie to be classed as my favorite and one of the best which i don't think too many movies are. It was filed with so many situations which all came together in the end to create such a movie with so many feelings throughout the whole thing. The love, friendship, family, enemies, happiness, and sadness we so perfectly acted out by the cast and the directing was very uniquely and nicely done as well.
B00006690G|5.0|This is probably Eminem's best CD yet. Giving you songs like Without Me, Hailie's Song, Soldier, Business,White America, and Sing For the Moment. If you like Eminem you should get this CD
B000067CPX|5.0|im sitting here wondering why some people don't like this album?  oh wait i know now they don't know good music when they hear it.  the chili peppers are so awesome on this album on any album actually but this one especially.  the first 3 tracks by the way, universally speaking, and this is the place are all stand out tracks, well actually all the tracks are stand out tracks.  this kinda reminds me of incubus because their newest cd morning view (their best cd) is alot more mellow and more enjoyable to listen to like by the way is.  this cd is so great buy it.  it is worth the money  and it is worth it to hear this is the place that is my new favorite chili peppers song its even better then under the bridge.  this cd sounds more like otherside, californication, and under the bridge so if you like those songs you'll like this disc. even if you don't you'll like this and if you don't i don't understand how you can't like this cd.
0738206679|5.0|This book is an absolute diamond.<br />I am not an explorer at the very frontiers of network dynamics, but I am an intelligent, sentient being and the ideas being developed in network research are of great importance to my life and the world I live in.  I find the academic journals, where the research results are first published, (deliberately?) impenetrable, so it is a delight and a joy to find a guided tour in plain English, with an authoritative guide, through the frontiers of some very current and paradigm-changing ideas.<br />The book's narrative is aimed at the general public, to be sure, but I hadn't heard that being a member of the general public was a crime or a slur.  Perhaps I missed a meeting.  I found the writing style to be clear, concise, engaging and entertaining.  In short, it was one of the best books of any genre that I have ever read and I have read hundreds.<br />Another reviewer of this book (see below) has said that Barabasi overemphasises the importance of preferential attachment in forming scale free network topologies.  OK.  Bring it on.  Where is your counter explanation?  What is the more important factor?  Where is your clearly-written book explaining your counter argument for the likes of me?  I would really like to know what else could possibly account for the emergence of this topology.  It's important to me.  To that reviewer I say, &quot;publish or be dammed&quot;.  I cannot abide elitism in scientific research, whereby those in the know jealously guard their secrets from the rest of us, so as to reinforce their self-belief in their uber-mortality.  Join the real world.  Tells us what you know without being patronising.<br />If, as a reader, you are in any way interested in the spread (or diffusion) of ideas, innovations, fads, viruses, memes, rumours and a hundred other phenomena or want to understand why some things are runaway hits and others not, this book will definitely stimulate your thinking.  The only minor frustration I had with the book was that in identifying Microsoft's success in operating systems as analogous to a Bose Einstein condensate (a superfluid?), the book fails to explain how the condensate can evaporate...in other words, what nodal or network conditions would have to apply to overturn Microsoft's dominance?<br />As a published technical author myself, I know that writing this well is sheer hard work.  I would be delighted if any of my own works were as brilliantly executed as Barabasi's &quot;Linked&quot;.<br />Buy it.  You won't be sorry.
B000002H2H|5.0|Some people may argue, but in my oppinion this is MetallicA at their best. I'd say it's a tie with \\"...And Justice For All\\" for their heavyist. I'd desribe this album as a mix of heavy metal and thrash, which turns out to be a very good mixture.<br />1. Fight Fire With Fire - 10/10 One of the best songs on RTL, the melodic \\"countryish\\" beggining is kinda wierd but after that it's raging guitars and drums and the screaming voice of Hetfield the rest of the way.<br />2. Ride The Lighting - 10/10 The title track is also a very good one. It's not quite as hard as FFWF but still gets 10 stars in my book.<br />3. For Whom The Bell Tolls - 9/10 This song is a little more complicated than heavy but its still really good.<br />4. Fade To Black - 10/10 This is definly one of there best songs ever if not best. I'd say it's in a tie with \\"One\\" for their best melodic song ever.<br />5. Trapped Under Ice - 9/10 This is a pretty fast song, its got lightning fast guitars plus James' awesome thrash vocals. This one is pure thrash.<br />6. Escape - 9/10 Most people hate this song(including James) and I really cannot understand why. I think this song is awesome, the chorus is a little different but the rest is some heavy sh*t.<br />7. Creeping Death - 10/10 This is my favorite song on RTL. It's in a close tie with \\"Battery\\" for their fastest song ever, definly a 10.<br />8. The Call Of Ktulu - 9/10 I think this is their 2nd best instrumental, behind \\"To Live Is To Die\\". Good closer to the album.<br />Well, as you can see none of these were less than a 9, so thats pretty f*ckin good. It's nearly impossible to be a true 'tallica fan and not have this one.
0780622650|5.0|It was while watching this movie that I had a chilling thought. &quot;Lost in space&quot; is easy to say and rolls off the tongue simply - but can you truly imagine, considering the immensity of the universe, how terrifying it would be to be genuinely LOST IN SPACE? When they attempt to chart any known constellations and nothing comes up it struck me how hopeless their situation really is. It was a scary thought.<br />The film's great and the special effects are still amazing 4 years later. I love this movie and highly recommend it as an exciting ride from start to finish.
0380820846|2.0|I am sorry to admit it but once again I have been silly enough to run out and purchase another Julia Quinn novel before just waiting for it to circulate in my local library. I do regret that because I have been dissapointed tremendously by the very slow pace of the story and the lack of genuine emotion the characters have for each other. Dont get me wrong, Ms. Quinn tries to convince us that certainly, the heroine does love the hero and has for quite some time but I'm sorry, I just cant buy that anymore than the lukewarm love the hero decides to have for her. <BR>For the most part I found it a tedious crawl to finish the whole novel, only enjoying the Whistledown columns. <BR>I think I could have stomached it much better had I not had to keep guessing at what the charcters were trying to convy, I just really couldn't understand why the main characters didnt understand WHY they were feeling the way they were feeling at times or doing some of the things that they would catch themselves doing....<BR>'she didnt know why she was smiling, she just was'  <BR>And I dont know why i bought the book, no wait, yes I do....temporary collapse in judgement.
B000000WF0|5.0|Basically an album of powerful ballads.  Urban Hymns will appeal to more people than any of (The) Verve's previous work.  I personally prefer their older stuff but I am certain I'm in the minority.  I give it five stars for a reason though, it's that good.  Give it a try certainly, perhaps download some MP3s, and if you like it make sure not to overlook all of their earlier work ie Storm in Heaven, Northern Soul, No Come Down ect...
B00006879E|5.0|I have been a fan for almost the past two years now...and all I can say is that this album is amazing. Their sound is refined and polished. Adam's vocal stylings are unlike anything I have ever heard before, he's so passionate. He leads you through his lyrics more smoothly then I have ever heard before. Ryan drumming is intense to say the least. His presision is unreal and his beat is demanding, one of the best drummers I have ever met. Mickey's bass lines are solid, they keep you guessing as to what he is going to do next, and when you hear it, it makes so much sense because the sounds he is delivering are so powerful and controlling you are forced to follow him. James Valentine's guitar playing is classic. He really blows my mind (ecspecailly live). We haven't heard the likes of these stylings since Hendrix and Santana. What a sound. And Jesse is a mastermind. He incooperates keyboards so beautifully throughout their music and makes you get lost in his sound. Everytime I listen to one of their songs I hear him doing something that I had never heard before. I love it. <BR>Songs About Jane is one of my favorite albums because of the way you flow with their music while listening to it. It's rock, punk, pop, jazz and R&amp;B all mixed into one. They will unleash feelings in you that you haven't had before. If you buy the c.d...you'll love it, but promise yourself to see them live and you will be &quot;Tangeled,&quot; and you'll love it.
B000007T1M|5.0|I bought Toxicity when it first came out and loved it so I bought this CD.  This band is amazing.  The music is so varied and interesting.  I don't know what these other people are talking about how the guitar and drums are &quot;standard&quot;.  I think the guitar is some of the most imaginative stuff I've heard in this genre.  Some of these songs would never even be in the wildest dreams of some bands, and these guys pull it off amazingly.  The singer has a great voice too.  There is nothing mediocre about these guys.  Pick this CD up, along with Toxicity.
B00003CXXP|1.0|This is by far one of the worst American movies I have ever seen in my entire life. I will admit the story kept me interested half-way through. Wondering what would happen next to our robotic boy-wonder. Then it was all down hill from there. As soon as I realized they were ripping off Pinochio, I began to slouch in my chair in disgust. Then when boy wonder gets where he is supposed to go. There are a bunch of plot twist (if thats what you can call them) that make absolutely no sense. For example when he enters the studio and destroys another robot because he thought he was unique. I wonder how long it took them to think up the very ending-because it looked like they were struggling for a conclusion. Well lets just say I felt the ending was so completely pointless that I wanted to vomit then stomp the DVD. <br />But I recommend to see this movie, just so you know how millions of dollars got thrown away.
B000000OTU|4.0|one of the greatest rock n' roll bands of all time.one of the greatest hits collection of all time-even though their greatest hits[the red one]is classic.this one has something special.made in the 90's.this band still knows how to rock and make classics more than 20 years in their career.that's classic.
0767836286|5.0|This was one of the coolest movies I have ever seen. I recommend it to anyone. It's one of those movies you tend to ignore because the title sounds boring. But trust me it's not.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is by far the best pictured ever made, and if you havent seen it,I think you should, because you are missing somthing, that is going to change the way you see the hole perseption of the imagination that has to be in a movie. To tell a story is easy, but to blow all your sences, the way this movie does, IS THE EXPERENCE OF BEEIN IN A MOVIE .
0440178002|5.0|This book was truly incredible.  I tried to read it a couple years ago and had trouble.  I think I was just too young to take it all in.  Now (at age 17) I have finished it and it is quite possibly one of my favorite books of all time.  The way Clavell is able to make everything fit together and create such deep characters is just awesome.  I loved this book up till the very end.  It will teach you a lot about old Japanese culture.  Enjoy it!!

B00005JKCF|2.0|Spiderman: the Movie<br />Spiderman. What a disappointment. And from the director who made The Evil Dead and Darkman which makes it doubly disappointing.  Just as another promising director, Tim Burton, fell by the wayside when he made a big budget, summer blockbuster remake of Planet of the Apes, so, too, has Raimi with this adaptation of the comic.<br />Based on the Marvel comic strip and updated to contemporary New York, Tobey Maquire (The Ice Storm) plays Peter Parker, the inept, bespectacled, bumbling nerd who is bitten by a genetically modified (in a reworking of the original, radioactive and no doubt reflecting our contemporary fears over GM as opposed to postwar fears of nuclear apocalypse) spider during a field trip to Columbia University.  <br />This story is a conventional love story. As the opening voiceover says, \\"like all good stories, it's about a girl\\". Parker - all spectacles, spam and centre parting - has loved his next-door neighbour, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), since the age of six.  Once bitter, Peter grapples with the overnight transformation to his body, a very obvious metaphor for the hormonal changes all teenagers go through.  He develops muscle tone, the ability to jump, climb walls and, in another reworking of the original, shoot webs out of his wrists. <br />Things seem to be going well for Peter - he impresses Mary Jane, he beats up her bullying boyfriend - until his uncle is shot and the Green Goblin (played excellently by Willem Dafoe) arrives on the scene.  Peter internalises the last words of his uncle: `with great power comes great responsibility' and, as Spiderman, he sets out to fight crime, prompted by the knowledge he could have prevented his uncle's death.  His crime-fighting, though is compounded by the entrance of the maniacal Goblin, who is determined to persuade Spiderman to join him or kill him if he won't. The Goblin is the alter ego of Norman Osborn, an arms manufacturer, and the father of Peter's best friend who, it turns out, is also dating Mary Jane.<br />The sequences of Spiderman demonstrating his skills are by far the best. Spiderman leaps, swings, jumps and so on. The battle sequences with the Green Goblin are exciting, particularly against the backdrop of the re-edited New York City (sequences depicting the World Trade Center were recut).  J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jameson, the Daily Bugle editor who gives Parker his first job as a photographer, was great (particularly when compared to his role as a neo-Nazi on the cult series Oz). And Kirsten Dunst looked cute as the gal.<br />Overall, though, the parts did not equal the sum. The CGI wasn't adequate: when Spiderman climbed walls I did not willingly suspend disbelief.  The narrative pace was jerky. Long-winded romantic scenes slowed action sequences down and the overall pace was not maintained.  Perhaps big-budgets do not suit Raimi, but then he has a hard act to live up to because his Darkman was, and probably still is, the best comic-book style adaptation on film.  This does not bode well. If Raimi can't handle such an adaptation, then what hope do we have for the forthcoming Scooby Doo and others?

0385486804|4.0|An ejoyable book, the central subject is a little weak to exapnd from a magazine articel to a book, but Krakauer seems to have found a good solution. The story is nicely cut up, leaving the fatal incidents until the end of the book, while interspesing the narative with tales of various other daventurers who have thrown themselves into the wild.<BR>Chris McCandless's story is definately a little idealised and presented in a rose tinted aspect, as it would be vey easy to offer a different and less sympathetic opinion with the evidence given. and other than the tragic consequences the story is not that remarkable. I actually found Krakauers own story far more entertaining and terrifying, but its easy to see his involvement with the story.
B00003CXRM|5.0|In O Brother, Where Art Thou?, the Cohen Brothers have given us a joyful pageant of incredible wit, unforgettable characters, and indescribable music. The film takes place in a mythical South during the Great Depression, where the Klan lynches with impunity, politicians campaign with midgets, and the best way to get a car is through grand theft auto. Everett, a long winded man addicted to one brand of hair gel, has broken out of jail with the men he was, by chance, chained to: Pete, trusting and loyal, and Delmar, dull, yet kind-hearted. Together, they set out across the land, to reach the treasure that Everett had stolen before a dam flooded the land where it was buried. But that is just the pretext. Along the way, there are baptisms, arguments, a betrayal or two, near lynching, the sale of souls, and an end encounter with the sherriff... and something more. I won't say who, but keep your ears open. It is wonderfully subtle, but when you know who he truly is... It's powerful. That subtle hint is one of the many signs of genius present throughout this film.<BR>Of course, the singing is justifiably one of the best known and best loved parts of the film. Although Disney seems to have currently stepped out of the ring, O Brother proves that musicals are still a delightful form of movie. From the opening credits and \\"Big Rock Candy Mountain\\", to the haunting rendition of \\"Oh, Death\\" at the Klan Rally, up until the prophet's singing of \\"Angel Band\\" as he rolls toward the horizon<BR>The characters are rich, one and all. Everett's commentary on why a blind man with no name would have trouble finding work, Delmar's remark that while Pete would be 84 when leaving prison, \\"I'll only be 82.\\" , and Pete's apologizing to God before betraying his friends, reflect wonderful characters rare to find in any medium, created in a labor of love . And not just the main ones: from the incompetent election officials, to George Nelson, each character becomes unforgettable, instead of the vague stereotype all too common in films.<BR>As for the wit... well, as Pappy O'Daniel says, there's no accounting for taste. But from Delmar's repetitive offering of a roasted gopher to Everett to the exclamation in the midst of the haunting Klan rally that \\"The color guard is colored!\\" the rich dialogue and wonderful sight gags (i.e. the sheer amount of Dapper Dan Everett uses, seen at the end) lighten the darkest scene, and further show the honed Craft of the Cohen's<BR>In short, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a joy of a film. With a rich world brought to life, it is one of the finest films to grace the silver screen.
B00005TT77|5.0|The soundtrack from \\"I Am Sam\\" is a piece of art, which could easily have been released and been successful on its own as homage to the great Beatles. This was a CD, which didn't leave my player for weeks, but some of the songs at the end could do with some improvement. The Wallflowers add new and interesting harmony to \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" while Sarah McLachlan does a beautiful, rousing version of \\"Blackbird\\". About  of the album improves on the Beatles, while the others are just as good or a little worse. All in all, there is truly no horrible song or rendition of one on this album. A fantastic tribute to one of the greatest bands of the 1900s.
B000035P7X|4.0|&quot;Dont Look Back&quot; is a look at one of the most unique pop culture icons the United States has ever seen: Bob Dylan. The usually mysterious and sometimes reclusive Dylan gives us insight into his life we before could only listen to in his music. There were many things that made this movie fantastic. It's so interesting to listen to Dylan interact with others. It sounds strange, but he seems to be on another plane, to think differently than others around him. A good example is the conversation he has with a student in which the student struggles to find a definition for the word &quot;friend.&quot; Dylan makes him look like a fool and it's quite hilarious. Another great thing about the film are the live performances. Though I wish there were more featured, the ones shown are nothing short of captivating. This is reflected in the faces of the audience members, all sitting motionless, staring at Dylan with jaws slightly agape. I also enjoyed the scenes in which Dylan hangs out with his entourage, which features numerous celebrities such as Joan Baez, who sings a wonderful little folk song at one point in the film. Though fans of Dylan will definitley appreciate the film more than those who hate him, I think that many would enjoy this film, if only for Pennebaker's interesting cinematographical techniques. He makes you feel as if you are with Dylan, in London, in 1965. His techniques are quite effective. Recommended for all, but especially for fellow Dylan lovers.
B000067CPX|4.0|\\"By The Way\\" is a triumphant sequel to \\"Californication\\". The title and first track begins with a beautiful chorus which ends up woven between the rap-punk verses sometimes with a harmony amazingly performed by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. It's a track that reminds the listener of a funky \\"Under the Bridge\\". It combines the best of both talents the Peppers possess- the ability to create pretty music and remain defiantly punk-rock. The rest of the CD is a whole lot slower, letting the Red Hot Chili Peppers experiment with new harmonies and different guitar riffs. Even the harder rap stuff is peppered with background \\"Ooh\\"s and \\"Aah\\"s in harmony. Also, unlike other albums on the market, it stretches to more than 68 minutes, nearly filling the CD and giving the buyer a fantastic value for the money. This is one album you can pump up the volume on and not completely offend the neighbors.
B000066F6H|5.0|Finally, someone throws a musical punch at all the [junk] which radiates through our radiowaves every day. Finally, a band which brings it all back home.  THIS IS ROCK N' ROLL. The Hives are something unique, a band that can rock your socks off while still appealing to a large audience. When I first heard \\"Hate To Say I Told You So\\" I had no idea how a straight up punk rock song was now being played on my radio? How could this be? I don't have an answer to this question yet. But truthfully, I don't care. The Hives are here! Simplistic, power chord-driven, Ramones-esque punk rock is what is delivered in \\"Veni Vidi Vicious\\" (such a cool album title). The raw energy that characterized many of the early rock n' roll bands and the punk bands of the late 70's flows through the Hives. Howlin' Pelle Almvquist is a charismatic frontman and the rest of the band fits into their roles perfectly. Their attire: black suits with silver ties. SO COOL! These guys are like the Kinks, Ramones, and the MC5 thrown into one. Who cares if they're not exceptionally talented musically? Neither were any of the above bands. What they've got is heart, and that's something that's lacking in most of today's music. Buy this immediately and keep rock n' roll alive.

B00005JKMQ|3.0|\\"Ali\\" runs an impressive 157 minutes - yet we don't feel as if we know much more about Muhammad Ali THE PERSON at the end of the film than we did at the beginning.  Sure, we may know more facts and details about his life than we did before but not about what really makes him TICK.<br />Of course, any film that attempts to record the life of a man is, by necessity, going to have to pick and choose which of the many events of that life to leave in and which to throw out.  Granted.  But the cursory nature of the screenplay causes a serious problem for this film.  The story picks up Ali's life in 1964, back when he was still known as Cassius Clay, de-throning Sonny Liston to become heavyweight-boxing champion of the world.  The time in his life before this event is dealt with in elliptical fashion.  We see virtually nothing about how he was raised, what his parents were like, what kind of values they instilled in him, what motivated him to become a boxer and, most importantly, what drew him so passionately to the creed espoused by the Nation of Islam.  Without this crucial understanding of his formative years, the Ali we see in the film seems a very superficial version of the undoubtedly more complex real life figure.  For all the screenplay's devotion to the minutiae of Ali's career as a boxer, his travels to Africa, his experiences with women, his world-famous bouts with Joe Frasier and George Foreman, the Ali of this film remains a frustrating enigma from first moment to last.  Worse, he remains static as a character, never undergoing the kind of mental, emotional or psychological growth one would expect a biography to show us.  Even his trademark egotism comes across as just a front for public consumption since he doesn't exhibit any undue arrogance in his dealings with those around him when he is out of the limelight.  Perhaps that might be the point the film is trying to make, but if it is, it is never clearly or effectively exploited to any thematic or dramatic purpose.<br />That is not to say that the film does not provide some ancillary pleasures.  Certainly, its strongest asset is its ability to recreate a fascinating time in world history.  Since Ali's life seemed to touch on so many of the key events of that era - racism, Black Pride, the Vietnam War, the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. - his story actually becomes emblematic of the times in which he prospered.  Director Michael Mann manages to capture the flavor of that moment in bold, telling strokes, in large crowd scenes and in glimpses of protest riots and the brutal slayings of unarmed men. Yet, when necessary, Mann proves himself the master of both understatement and subtlety, as in his almost indirect depiction of King's killing.  In terms of their editing, the boxing scenes seem somehow less dynamic - and thereby perhaps a bit more realistic - than those in many other films on the subject.<br />Will Smith does an excellent job in bringing Ali to life, even if the script doesn't always provide him with the material he could have used to get at the core of the man's being.  Jon Voight does an effective job under all the makeup impersonating the inimitable Howard Cosell, yet, here too, we are never really shown just how this obviously symbiotic relationship between the boxer and the sportscaster ever came to develop.  It is crucial details like these which seem to be missing all throughout the movie.  Thus, despite the wonderful time capsule aspect of the film, \\"Ali\\" emerges as a disappointingly superficial study of its subject.<br />For whatever reason, the lives of boxers remain prime grist for the moviemaking mill.  In just the last few years alone, we have had films made about both \\"Hurricane\\" Carter and Muhammad Ali.  My only question is this: can \\"The Mike Tyson Story\\" be far behind?purpose.<br />That is not to say that the film does not provide some ancillary pleasures.

B000005EJL|4.0|Unlike many people have suggested, alot has changed with Supertramp. <BR> \\"It's A Hard World\\" opens the album, and it is anything but your typical Supertramp fare. The dark, smokey jazz track is something like Steely Dan on a cloudy day with more soul. Clocking at nearly ten minutes, the tune showcases chilled-out electric piano, atmospheric effects and plenty of little guitar and horn interjections. A much hipper, darker sound is displayed in this song that Supertramp has never touched upon before.<BR> The next track, the light-heard \\"You Win, I Lose\\" is cute, but it wears off pretty fast, with its jumpy little guitar rolls and cheery electric piano. This track appears to be an attempt at reproducing the classic sound, but it doesn't work too well. The chorus is pretty decent, but overall, this song, instead of resurrecting the positive sound of \\"classic\\" Tramp, it only proves to be a bit embarrasing.<BR> \\"Get You Act Together\\" has sort of a bluesy feel, but is far too clean to reallby be classified as that. The chorus, though, is pure Supertramp, which effortlessly shows us the feel that the previous track failed at. This song might be considered \\"easy-listening\\" by some people for its easy-going groove, but Davies' soulful voice knocks down all such accusations.<BR> \\"Live to Love You,\\" however, is easy-listening to the fullest, but who could help but indulge in the tuneful pleasures of Rick Davies' sincere voice? Not very good, but tolerable for a ballad.<BR> The title track is a punchy jazz-rock number that features a mind-blowing, groove-a-licious chorus with a hip, jazz-funk feel that is one of the best things the band has ever done. Some cool but not-too-original guitar soloing is thrown in for good measure, but the real attraction is Rick's electric piano solo. The jamming is confident, sophisticated, and infectious, and the glassy timbre of the electric piano makes this nothing short of aural bliss, and the subsequent trippy sax/trumpet jamming is perhaps the Tramps spaciest moment in their history.<BR> \\"Listen to Me Please\\" features some entertaining vocal interaction between Davies and Mark Hart, and while the vocals are a tad trite, the song has an icy, jazz-ish vibe to it that makes a real pleasure to listen to.<BR> \\"Sooner of Later\\" has this bassline that is one of those riffs that _should_ have gone into the pantheon of greatest basslines ever, but hey, you can't win 'em all. Hart's breezy vocals carry this funky jazz groove for the first couple minutes, and then it reaches new hieghts of grooviness when the horn section embarks on a first-rate journey through jazz improvisation, not to mention the funky organ jamming, which is also quite delicious.<BR> \\"Help Me Down that Road\\" is in the same vein as \\"Get Your Act Together,\\" but scores significantly higher on the soul factor, due to its more sincere feel and spicy groove. Quite different from anything we've heard from this group before.<BR> \\"And the Light\\" is a soft-sounding ballad, of a type which a generally shun, and yet I find myself enjoying this tune at last. I guess I am just a sucker for Davies' voice, since the composition and the lyrics are rather unoriginal and corny.<BR> The next track is a secret track of sorts. If its on your CD, than lucky you. But otherwise, the next track should be \\"C'est What?\\" which is another jazz-rock tour-de-force, which gets quite ferociously groovy from time to time, in between mellower sections. This song is all about dynamics. Quiet, loud, quiet, loud, etc. Definetly the most rocking song on here, which borrows from jazz, rock as well as soul and classic R'n'B.<BR> \\"Where There's A Will\\" starts of sounding lame enough, and the intentionally clicheic lyrics, but once it gets picked up, it actually has a pretty cool soulful sound, and you can tell that Davies is really playing and singing his heart on this one, despite the dumb lyrics. But dig the almost Gospel-ish sound on this track. It's pretty unlike anything that theband has ever done, like most stuff on this album.<BR> After a close examination of this album, it appears that more has changed than the title suggests. In fact, this album is a prime example of the drastic evolution a band can undergo in a lengthy 30 year career. Sure, the style has changed quite a bit, but the unique spirit of Supertramp remains intact. It's just a matter of finding it in this interesting and unusual album.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas. Probably one of the most influential three letters in hip hop. I wanted this album back in the 8th grade and didn't get my hands on it until after \\"It was written\\" was released. Until this day, you sit and analyze his rhymes and wonder what was he thinking when he wrote and freestyled these rhymes. This is one of the very few albums that will remain a classic amongst other classics such as B.I.G.'s Ready to Die album. The thing about this album is that it never dies. The lyrics are still untouchable until this day. He created a picture in your mind in every song, especially if your familiar with Queens, NY. If this isn't in your top 5 albums of all times, you slept also...
B000002J2B|4.0|If those pitiful purists would stop whining about Peter Gabriel's departure from the band, and concentrate just on the noise in the speakers rather than those pesky personel changes, they might find that this is actually a really good album.<BR>      Though lacking the lovable energy and lyrics of Peter Gabriel's bizarre mind, this album is anything but weak. It opens with a spacey, cosmic and almost orchetral intro, which is the start of the wonderful \\"11th Earl of Mar,\\" a multi-part, complex piece with dynamics and sonic color to spare, which is every bit as worthy as \\"Watcher of the Skies\\" or any other Gabriel-era classic. <BR>     The following track, \\"One for the Vine\\" is almost as good, though a bit more mellow and lacking in energy. However, the rich chord changes and keyboard textures, combined with Hackett's delicious guitar playing, make the song still stand up as a good tune.<BR>     \\"You're Own Special Way,\\" written by Rutherford, foreshadows the sappy balladry of Mike + the Mechanics. This song is a nasty blemish on an otherwise very good album. Skip it, or deal with it. But in all reality, the song in its own isn't too terrible, just out of place on such an album, and, in comparison to ther other tracks, quite lame.<BR>     The three instrumental tracks range from cool to absolutely unforgettable, and they are very cool to listen too, especially a pleasure for fans of characteristic Banks/Hackett melodicity.<BR>      \\"All In a Mouse's Night\\" starts off with a keyboard riff that I think is something that sounds definitive of Genesis. While the lyrics on this song are pretty silly, and the melody isn't all that great in some parts, it has some redeeming parts, as well as those nice dynamics that you would come to expect from Genesis.<BR>    \\"Blood on the Rooftops\\" absolutely rules. Hackett's classical guitar playing is exquisite, and the chord progression in this is absolutely astounding. Mellow, and yet, extremely engaging. The synth leads over luxurious beds of acoustic guitar and mellotron are ecstacy, plain and simple. This song is absolutley incredible. Some parts actually remind me of Hackett's \\"Voyage of the Alcolyte.\\"<BR>     I already mentioned the instrumental tracks, which are lovely bits of symp-prog in all its glory, so now we move on to \\"Afterglow,\\" the closing track, and a live favorite. While the simple arrangement of the song isn't much to be impressed with, the song has a very strange feeling of awe to it, and the melody will stick with you for days or longer.<BR>     So, to the haters of this album, I ask, \\"What's the problem with it?\\" I haven't been able to find out why this album is so despised by some people. One reason of heard was an oversaturation of Banksynths, but if you don't like Banks, then what are you doing listening to Genesis? If you like classic Genesis, then do yourself a favor and buy this. Throw your trivial personel issues aside, and just enjoy the music.
B000002N1E|5.0|....before they conquer every heart?  With this question, Prince kicks into \\"Dolphin\\" one of his lovliest and most melodic songs ever. The amazing thing about \\"The Gold Experience\\" is the sheer musicality of the whole affair, Prince and his band don't try too hard to push the music in any particular direction, they simply play with spirit, vigor and raw virtuosity from start to finish and the results are never less than stunning. While his other classic band, The Revolution, was funky and lively but somewhat mechanical sounding, the group of musicians assembled here (especially drummer Michael Bland, bassist Willy T., guitarist Levi Seacer and the incredible Tommy Barbarella on keyboards)are more flexible, fluid and melodic in their approach. While the \\"NPG Operator\\" interludes are entirely unneccesary and somewhat grating, the overall listening experience is enthralling. \\"Billy Jack [something]\\", \\"Shy\\" and \\"Gold\\" are my favorite tracks here but they wouldn't work nearly as well outside the framework of this album, this is what true cohesion is all about. A Fine Work.
B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic is considered to be one of the best lyrical masterpeices that ever came out of the rap game, and if you hear the CD, the chances are slim that you will think otherwise.  But besides Nas' detailed rhymes of life in the slums, what the critics forgot to say is that the songs themselves sound good.  All I heard about this CD before I got it was that the lyrics were incredible, but after buying it, I saw that the album also had some phat beats. Out of the 10 tracks, there's not one I skip over.  Illmatic lives up to its words and is still a CD you can blast on your radio.  A must have.  Its a shame Nas' can't come out with another album like this one.
B000002KXO|5.0|\\"Love in Store\\"- very upbeat and catchy song, nice way to start off this album.<br />\\"Can't Go Back\\"- a good song by Lindsey Buckingham very driven, the beat sets up the song. <br />\\"That's Alright\\"- has a country-influenced feel, one of my favorites on this album. Stevie has a nice voice range in this song and doesn't over do it. <br />\\"Book of Love\\"- Lindsey not only sings this song he also has a nice guitar part in the background.<br />\\"Gypsy\\"- this is one of Stevie's signature songs along with Rhiannon and many others<br />\\"Only Over You\\"- very nice love by Christine McVie with inspiration from then boyfriend, Dennis Wilson.<br />\\"Empire State\\"- very different song by Buckingham very pop oriented<br />\\"Straight Back\\"- another one of my favorites off of this album, this song has a very mysterious sound and has very good background vocals by Stevie and Christine.<br />\\"Hold Me\\"- written by Christine McVie about boyfriend Dennis Wilson who within the time of this album drowned to death.<br />\\"Oh Diane\\"- wrote by Buckingham and Richard Dashut along with tracks 4 and 7. This song is very repetitious and is the shortest song on the album at 2:33.<br />\\"Eyes of the World\\"- wrote by Buckingham this is a somewhat catchy song, well at least the chorus is.<br />\\"Wish You Were Here\\"- the music by Christine McVie and with lyrics by Colin Allen another good love song by McVie and a very good way to end the album.
B00005S6K8|5.0|This is truly a wonderful film. Julia Ormand (Sabrina)is perfect. Harrison Ford is wonderful. All the characters play out their parts to perfection. It is one of those movies that you will want to watch over and over again. It has such charm, and it's decent. I am glad that once in a while Hollywood puts out decent movies, for those of us who are on a higher plane of thought.
B000002MIF|5.0|Hatful of Hollow is an absolutely extraordinary Smiths album, essential for any fan, and a great place for a neophyte to start. Consisting of live BBC versions of the best songs from their first handful of albums, this album faithfully reproduces - in live, exciting, invigorating versions - the best singles and album tracks from the early Smiths records. We get everything from short, memorable singles such as William, It Was Really Nothing, Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now, and the classic Accept Yourself, to more epic album tracks such as the masterful How Soon Is Now?, Handsome Devil, and others. An indispensable record.
B000056K04|1.0|This cd is nothing like the others. I am disgusted that Dave would just sell out like this and totally change his image and music.  I just hope he never releases something like this ever again.
B000001E29|4.0|The Black Rider is the weirdest album from an artist known for weird albums. Not a \\"regular\\" Tom Waits album and certainly not a \\"cast recording\\" as the listing states, this evolved from the Robert Wilson musical (with a William S. Burroughs libretto) for which Waits wrote the music. This album contains studio versions of some of these songs. It's roughly comparable to the style of Bone Machine, Waits' prior studio album, but it's actually quite different. In fact, it is unique in Waits' catalog. Though it has twenty tracks, there are only a handful of fully-formed Waits \\"songs,\\" the rest being instrumentals, songs written with other people (such as Burroughs, who also \\"sings\\" several tracks), and short interludes. This makes the album, along with Bone Machine and the recently released Alice, a fully-fledged, self-contained effort with a consistent sound, mood, and set of themes. One wonders how well the scattershot story - something involving the Devil, magic bullets, and lost love - translates onto the stage; here the story is far from linear, but the lyrics are pure Waits... and enjoyable on their own. Burroughs actually brings down the songs he contributes to in my view - but I'm a Waits fan. The Black Rider is usually not named when people reel off Waits albums, and it's easy to see why. I would approach this as a real Waits but separate from his other albums. I've also seen people who regard this as a masterwork and his best album, and you can see where they're coming from, if only because the album is so unusual that drastically different interpretations are inevitable. Simply put, this is not Waits' best album but one that fans will want - and that might also be a way to attract non-fans.
0812548094|1.0|I have read book number one in the series and I was very annoyed by all the perverted sex stuff in it (I have reviewed it too). I decided not to continue reading book number two, but I opened the book somewhere in the middle just to get an impression of how the book was. [...] He writes good and his books are exiting when they are meant to be, but I couldn't make myself read this book. It was almost a whole chapter just containing a woman (can't remember her name) torturing Richard (and it isn't just lashes of a whip!!!) at the same time as she loves him. That's just so [...] typical isn't it?? <BR>People might say that i judge the book too early since I've just read five pages, but I don't think that Goodkind has changed his sex-and-young-boys fixed thinking. I think it's VERY strange that people have almost not reacted on this before.
B000002NBY|4.0|Paul Simon's Graceland is an amazing album that shows just how successful a total artistic re-invention can be when done right. Eschewing totally his previous musical forays and incorporating the music of South Africa into his already diversified kaleidoscopic lyrical compositions, Simon here lends us a masterpiece of rock `n' roll idiosyncrasy. Simon has always been a mature and complex lyricist, and this album is no exception: words, phrases, and even choruses flow together to create one homogenous whole. The album, while having several standout compositions, is also comprised of one distinct mood and the songs ebb and flow effortlessly into one another. The music - always inventive, frequently beautiful - perfectly suits the lyrics and the compositions, and this is, overall, one of the most vibrant and complete-sounding albums you'll ever come across. Standouts include the title track, I Know What I Know, and You Can Call Me Al, but this is one fine album throughout.
B00005KARK|5.0|I remember watching this as a VERY little girl! It always seemed so safe and innocent even though Dumbo was separated from his mom. As a little kid I didn't notice it so much, but now I can't help but shed a tear at the poor lonely baby with only that little mouse and the crows for companionship. And I definitely agree that adults, esp. parents or those with a maternal streak will cry at &quot;Baby Mine&quot; and also when Dumbo first arrives and his mom wants to protect him from the jeering of the other elephants.<br />It's kind of like a semi- social commentary. From cruelty to animals to prejudice, there are kind of a lot of issues you could drag out of these 60 minutes! But even if you choose not to, any little kid (or anyone at all, really!) can find something poignant and/or endearing in the movie &quot;Dumbo&quot;!
B000002AZZ|5.0|New Skin For The Old Ceremony is a masterpiece, and one of Leonard Cohen's best albums. It's a truly great effort, and too often overlooked. Although his first three albums - particularly the first and third - are all certified masterpieces, this one, his fourth, was his first attempt to move beyond them in scope. Incorporating background vocalists and a wider array of instrumentation than he employed on those sparse first three efforts, Cohen creates here an album broader, more epic in scope than its predecessors. He also began, for the first time, to lighten up on the subject matter of his lyrics: incorporating some - albeit rather dark - humor into several of the songs here, Cohen creates an album - which, along with its broader musical pallette - that is a much easier listen this his first three, which were at times so depressing as to lend themselves to the status of \\"mood\\" albums. That said, Cohen is Cohen, and his themes remain the same; he has a lighter touch here at times, is all. Although the opening track, Is This What You Wanted?, features lyrics like \\"You were K.Y. Jelly/I was Vaseline\\" much of the rest of the album is pervaded with a deep and dark sense of self-loathing: Cohen places himself on a pedastal and de-construcs his persona as he did on \\"Avalanche\\", but in a much less abstract, far more direct and disturbing way. Cohen at this time was going through a period of extreme personal depression and writer's block (which would culminate in the Phil Spector collaboration on Death of A Ladies' Man), and songs such as Field Commander Cohen and A Singer Must Die attest to his state of mind at the time. A deep, dark, driving masterpiece with just the right amount of light touch, New Skin For The Old Ceremony is a great album, and an essential purchase for any admirer of Leonard Cohen.
B00001QEE9|4.0|... <BR>It's really a dark movie for little kids (even though I was tiny when I first saw it and it hasn't done me any psychological damage - that I know of!) but I think that it partly seems that way because we adults notice the dark details more than little kids who are just along for the fun-filled Disney ride. So I wouldn't advise against letting little kids watch this unless they are very sensitive (which come to think of it, I was, too, and it didn't scare me...) or have like a strange fear of whales or something else potentially scary in the movie.<BR>Despite the darker aspects, I still misted up when Pinnochio started to cry (\\"I'll never see my father again!\\") - yes, I almost cried watching a cartoon in a college class! - but I wasn't alone. Almost every female in the room had the same reaction.<BR>All in all, it's not the best Disney movie, but far from the worst! I would recommend it!
B000067CPX|4.0|Having been a Chili Peppers fan since the late 80's, it's been intresting watching them evolve from a LA party band to MTV-friendly mega band to darlings of the critics.  That said, I guess at this point it's best not to have any expectations when they release a CD.  This is especially true for 'By the Way'.  Coming on the heels of Californication, one of the best CD's of 1999, you had to wonder, what direction were they moving in, punk? funk? rap? or old-school rock n' roll?  (By the way, is there any better band to listen to in the car in the summer (with the possible exception of Sublime)?  I don't think I listened to any other CD than Californication in the car coming home from work in 1999.).<br />\\"By the Way\\" has less of the rock-out punk explosions that the Peppers are infamous for.  It still has a California feel, but in a Mammas and the Pappas way (which Anthony Kiedis admitted was a big influence, along with the Beach Boys).  There is a lot of harmony, both vocally and on guitar (side note - could Flea and John Frusciante be the most underrated lead/bass duo ever?  Can they issue a jam session CD?  Please?).  \\"Dosed\\" and \\"Venice Queen\\" (one of the best tracks) are especially lovely.<br />That said, I wasn't sure if I liked this CD at first.  Who would have thought that a Chili Peppers CD would evoke adjectives like \\"harmonious\\" or \\"lovely\\"?  Although they showed flashes of insight of the mega-hit \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\", I don't think anyone would have imagined 10 years ago that the Peppers would have released an album like \\"By the Way\\".   And that is part of the problem - this is a band whose image was shaped by Anthony Kiedis' chest-thumping wacked-out showmanship, nude performances, and silver body paint.  It's a long road from \\"Give it Away\\" and \\"Stone Cold Bush\\" to \\"Venice Queen\\".  So, forget what you think you know about the band, and listen to the new tracks as if starting from zero.  And try not to judge it until you've spun it a few times.  I wasinitially inclined to give it 3 stars, but after 3 days of listening it's up to 4.  Who knows how I'll feel about it in a month?
B000068QVN|4.0|First of all thank goodness for the re-issuing of the Grand Funk catalog...bout' time.  This disc definetly trumps the &quot;Live Album&quot; from the previous year in among other things, sound.  Obviously the boys are jacked for these shows as most of the songs seem to have been &quot;kicked up a bit&quot;, which is saying something when it comes to Funk.  Yes, there are some flaws but they are your normal &quot;live&quot; flaws (seems to be some feedback problems on guitar and at times they appear out of sync), but belive me, all in all a thouroughly enjoyable disc.  Great song selection from that era.  Definetly a disc to turn up (volume)---my first listen was at home so, I could not turn it up, and it sounded a bit muddy, then I took it to work with me and WOW, lets just say it took me a bit longer to get to work (had to take the long way). Buy it great price for the &quot;best live funk available&quot;---hopefully there will be more????
B000066NW0|5.0|Avrils new cd Let go is awsome its all i listen to pretty much from the time i wake up till the time i go to bed it always puts me in a great mood and starts my day off right! :) Avril is my role model!
6301174240|5.0|This Movie is very well done!  I am a True Michael Jackson Fan and i just love this movie i have the movie and i watch it again and again!  the first part of the movie is about his videos that he made including Beat it, Bad (Kid's Version) Smooth Crimnal, make The Change and many more!  Toward the end of the movie they have a shrot movie about this one guy that wants put all kids on drugs so michael has to save the day and Save three kids that are in danger on getting to be put on drugs!
B000066NW0|5.0|This Cd is one of the best CD's i have listened to in a long time. You barely find a CD where you love every single song on it, and that is how i feel about her CD. While listening to the cd, which i am right now, you gotta love all the different types of music which she puts onto this CD and it in a weird but good way works. It's an awesome CD and everyone should buy it! Avril Rocks!
B000059XYK|2.0|Well another brainless action thriller. I just thought that the acting was terrible in this one. The one scene that stands out in my mind is Nicolas Cage whispering sweet nothings to one of the cars. I guess I have a problem with movies that are totally unrealistic, unless they go out of there way to profess that they are unrealistic. The Evil Kinevil car jump scene is one of these that defies logic. There is plenty of action, if that is your thing. However, if you are expecting a movie that will leave an impression on you, then you will be very disappointed.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is so awesome she relates to me because I have like almost all guy friends and most of them are skateboarders so I love watching them and she's a skateboarder chick and thats what I want to be her style and her music is just soooo awesome she writes her own songs and music.Her song Complicated is sooo awesome it's true I like my guy to act like himself even when he's around his friends instead of acting like somebody else.You need this cd b/c it is soooo awesome so buy it today!!!!
B00000IQC8|4.0|Kevin Smith maxed out a batch of credit cards (... worth) to make this hilarious and very clever film. There's no real plot--basically, it's a day in the life of a couple of clerks and the assorted oddballs who populate their lives--but \\"Clerks\\" has ten times the energy and originality of nearly every big-budget, small-minded Hollywood production in recent memory. This is due in large part to Smith's profane, irreverent dialogue, surefooted direction, and some convincing performances. Many memorable, laugh-out-loud moments; my favorites have to be the \\"Star Wars\\" discussion, and the \\"sexual revelations\\" bit. (It's a riot hearing people discuss \\"Star Wars\\" as seriously as some would debate Plato's \\"Republic\\"). The low budget means this looks more like \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" than \\"The Matrix,\\" but big production values do not a great film make (see \\"Pearl Harbor\\" for a prime example). This is what filmmaking should be--not about noisy, splashy effects, demographics, or the bottom line, but about the art of filmmaking. Kudos to Kevin Smith and company for a funny and creative film.

1577311523|1.0|While the book he excerpted from this one (\\"Practicing the Power of Now\\") is excellent, this book suffers from Tolle's earlier efforts to drag in every type of \\"spirituality\\" and try to make them resonate with the truth--which he DOES present, interspersed among references to things he apparently doesn't realize are from the Dark Side of the Force.<BR>Instead of this book, read his \\"Practicing the Power of Now,\\" which contains the truth from this book, without the trash. It's a life-changing book for any reader that puts its simple suggestions into practice.<BR>Tolle's problem is that he had a powerful revelation of the simplicity of truth, but not about the tricks of deception. His second book corrects this mistake, and is good reading for any age reader and for any spiritual orientation.
6301223543|3.0|When movies first came out on video there were two legendary exploitation films I had to track down. One was \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" and the other was \\"I Spit on Your Grave,\\" which is actually the more memorable film of the pair overall (although I do grant the highest place to the \\"hook\\" scene in TCM). Director Meir Zarchi's 1978 film has become rather infamous, since critics hated it, audiences were outraged, and the film was banned in Germany and Great Britain. The story, such as it is, finds Jennifer Hill (Camille Keaton, Buster's grand-niece) out in the woods of Connecticut to work on a novel when she crosses the path of some local boys who decide she should be the first sexual partner for their mentally-disabled friend. When he cannot complete the rape, his friends do it for him. Then they decide that they are not done with Jennifer.<br />At issue are not Jennifer's specific acts of revenge, including the infamous bathroom scene, but rather the series of brutal rapes that precede them. I do not want to meet anyone who is not disturbed by these rape scenes and I think it is fairly obvious that Zarchi intended to make audiences uncomfortable. In retrospect you have to wonder about all those movies with rape scenes that do NOT upset the audience. But Zarchi certainly pours it on thick, absolutely assuring that things go beyond the tolerance level of anyone who watches this film. So the bottom line is that this film will upset you and it is therefore effective at doing exactly what it wants to do, which is supposed to be a good thing, right? I have always considered this an \\"X\\" rated movie although I would not consider it pornographic in the traditional sense. But it is a very disturbing film and I do not think I would want my kids to see it until after they graduate college (if ever). Anyone renting this film for cheap thrills is in for a shock.<br />As I now understand it, this 1978 film was originally released as \\"Day of the Woman,\\" but that rather innocuous title was replaced by the well known \\"I Spit on Your Grave,\\" although the film was also screened as \\"I Hate Your Guts\\" and \\"The Rape and Revenge of Jennifer Hill.\\" All of this is interesting since it seems the producers were trying to pass off this film with both higher and lover levels of pretention. Beyond being letterboxed, this DVD offers nothing than the cheesy original theatrical trailer. But this is one film where you would certainly like to have to hear what the director has to say.ous title was replaced by the well known \\"I Spit on Your Grave,\\" although the film was also screened as \\"I Hate Your Guts\\" and \\"The Rape and Revenge of Jennifer Hill.\\" All of this is interesting since it seems the producers were trying to pass off this film with both higher and lover levels of pretention.

B00004VWA2|5.0|Wow.  Paul Klingberg is quickly becoming my #1 remixer for 5.1 sound.  First EWF and now this...but he outdoes himself on Tapestry.  The gorgeous title song sends shivers up my spine with the vibes moved to the rear speakers and her voice just everywhere, with incredible presence.  I could've used a little less tape hiss, but doing so would've taken out the dynamics of her voice.   No...you're not going to mistake it as a 2002 recording with its stridency in spots, but trust me, any fan of this seminal album will be absolutely blown away by this painstaking mix.  \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Tapestry\\" are reason enough to either 1)  Sell the original Stereo SACD release asap or 2) Get a Multi SACD player outright.  THIS (and BJ's \\"Stranger\\")is the reason I splurged for the Pioneer multi-player.  Yes...it's that good.    I'm going back to listen some more!
B000002L71|5.0|When we are talking about Punk Rock Music, the genre might have been defined by Johnny Rotten and the Sex Pistols, and Hole's \\"Live Through This\\" might be my favorite Punk album, but when it is time to go before the Gods of Music I think David Byrne should stand before the Throne of Judgment and make the case for everybody else.  While he is up there, the first piece of evidence he should intorduce would be the Talking Heads' soundtrack for \\"Stop Making Sense.\\"<br />Of course, you can only listen to the soundtrack AFTER you have seen Jonathan Demme's documentary, because one of the key lessons here is that Punk music achieves full existence only in live performances.  The opening track of \\"Psycho Killer\\" alone proves that, although this version of \\"Burning Down the House\\" certainly has it moments.  My favorite is \\"Take Me to the River,\\" but I may well be overestimating the spin the band puts on that one.<br />Finally, remember: \\"THE SPACE PEOPLE.  Space People read our mail.  The Space People think that TV news programs are comedies, and that soap operas are news.  The Space People will contact us when they can make money by doing so.  The Space People think factories are musical instruments.  They sing along with them.  Each song lasts from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.  No music on weekends.\\"<br />Here endeth the lesson.

B000002KD9|5.0|The fact that the lyrics for the songs on \\"After the Gold Rush\\" are handwritten totally fits this album, which always struck me as the rawest of Neil Young's albums.  Even the photograph of th back of Young's jeans fits this mold.  Once again Young is aided by Crazy Horse and further abetted by Greg Reeves, Steve Stills, and Nils Lofgren.  There is a thematic nature to the songs since most of them were inspired by the Dean Stockwell-Herb Berman screenplay \\"After the Gold Rush.\\"  Do not try to find the film, it was never made.  However in 1982 Young and Stockwell directed \\"Human Highway\\" from Stockwell's script.  Young plays Lionel Switch, who finds himself owning a roadside diner near a leaking nuclear powre plant who wants to torch the place to collect insurance, at which point wackiness ensues (the movie has Dennis Hopper, Sally Kirkland and Devo).  But I digress.  This album features several classic Young tunes: \\"Tell Me Why,\\" \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart,\\" \\"Southern Man,\\" and \\"I Believe in You.\\"  In many ways, this is also stripped down Neil Young.  If you have enjoyed the man's music in its many facets, then this is one aspect you have to cover in your efforts at appreciation.
B00005QEO2|5.0|Aerosmith has proved time and time again that they are the best rock 'n' roll band in the world.  They have always seemed to re-invent themselves with every release.  This cd is probably the best compliation cd that you could have in your collection.  From the first song &quot;Let the music do the talking&quot; on the first disc to the live version of &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; on the second disc, this collection is the most complete Aerosmith collection you could get.  The only real dissapointing songs on this cd are &quot;My Fist Your Face&quot;, &quot;Shame On You&quot;, and &quot;Heart's Done Time&quot;.  Other than that, this cd is almost complete.  The only song missing or only two songs missing are &quot;Walk This Way&quot; (the origional version) and &quot;Same Song And Dance&quot;.  They claim the reason that they aren't on here is because Geffin doesn't have the legal rights to the songs.  They needed to quickly buy the rights if not only for just this cd.  Other than that, this cd rocks.
B000001F3C|4.0|Obviously \\"The Joshua Tree\\" was U2's breakthrough album, but in retrospect I would make a case for \\"War\\" being their most pivotal work.  In a word, this is the point where the lyrics catch up with the music.  You can listen to \\"Boy\\" and \\"October\\" and find the sound, which in the beginning was focused on the Edge's jagged guitar riffs (\\"I Will Follow\\" is the best song from those two albums), but the lyrics are pretty much just something for Bono to do while the band plays on.<br />However, when we get to \\"War,\\" things have clearly changed.  If the title and the cover shot (a young boy, his lower lip bloodied, his hands locked behind his head a standard pose of submission), then the lyrics of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" quickly settle the matter.  Along with \\"New Year's Day\\" and \\"'40'\\" they place \\"the Troubles\\" at the heart of the album's gestalt.  The political position they are taking vis-a-vis the sectarian strife in Northern Island is rather nebulous, but there is a potency to the music and the lyrics hitherto unfelt in U2's songs (forever captured in the music video of the group performing the song at Red Rocks).  But then there is nothing wrong with offering awareness and concern rather than solutions.  This is a problem that has been boiling over for centuries.<br />When an artist or group makes it big, there is a tendency among their true fans (defined as those who were in on the action before the bandwagon loaded up), to look back at one of their \\"early\\" albums with great nostaglic affection.  For U2 that album would have to be \\"War.\\"

B00005QZWI|5.0|Peter Jackson really picked the right guy to create the music for this movie. Howard Shore was really able to capture the different cultures and places of Tolkien's world. The theme for the Hobbits is playful and lighthearted, the Elven theme is beautiful and thought-provoking, and Bara-Dur sounds evil. If you like the movie at all you have to get this. It is my favorite CD. I have listened to this about a hundred times, and it never looses its beauty. I can't wait for the Two Towers soundtrack!
630587493X|5.0|This movie is Nothing like I thought it was going to be.  It was advertised all wrong.  It was a very sad movie about Andrew Martin played by Robin Williams who wants to become human and witnesses the death's of his first owner, then Little Miss, and then pleads to be counted as a human before a senate and he dies before hearing the announcement and then Portia says shut off her machine and then she dies.  The movie still makes me cry and always will.  I recommend this movie it is a very sad movie.
B000067CPX|5.0|by the way is a really good album.. it takes a couple listens to catch on to the catchiness of the songs... but once you get into the groove of the album, you'll be happy you bought it.  at least i was.  as for compairing it to the chili pepper's previous albums, its different.  but then again all of their albums are distinct and unique.  if you're an old chili peppers fan, just try to listen with new ears.
6305531412|5.0|This movie is one of the best animated/real life movie I have seen. This movie I thought seemed so cool because it had to make the cartoons interact with live people and it looked so real!  This movie could never be done again because movies are to involved in special effects of the computer and not with animation anymore.  It's actually kind of sad.  This movie released June 21st 1988 grossed 154 Million dollars and deserved it.  There were many followers such as &quot;Cool World&quot; and the Paula Abdul video &quot;Opposites Attract&quot;.  The DVD is fine if you really want the movie now but wait there will be a better release of this movie just wait.
0316666343|5.0|My family endured a terrible crime to a member and this book caught the same feelings that we all went through: the inital shock and confusion, the physically wrenching feeling when the finality really sets in, the thoughts of &quot;what can I do now, how can I fix this?&quot;, the physical and emotional backlash years later, and the final making of peace with the pain.  The pain never leaves, but you do make friends with it and life will go on. This is a wonderful book about the healing process after such a terrible thing.
B00000I07P|5.0|This is the album to own by a hair band of the 1980s other than Poison.  This album features two number one hits &quot;You Give Love A Bad Name&quot; and &quot;Livin'On A Prayer&quot; and the top ten hit &quot;Wanted Dead Or Alive&quot; which hit 7.  This album is a must for the Bon Jovi fan and a great listen to music.  Released in 1986.
B000068QY7|2.0|Back in the day, nobody rocked harder and with more emotion than Oasis.  But this latest collection of Oasis rockers and ballards is thier most tired and bland offering yet. If the Gallager's are really so infatuated with the Beatles, then they should take a clue from their idols and expand their musical horizons. Who wants to hear a bunch of A and E chords mixed in with such un- inspiring lyrics as \\"Hold on....Hold on ...\\" hold on to your jockstrap Liam, cause you guys should get your butts kicked for this lame CD.
B00000273M|5.0|The bangles were the Girl Group of the 1980s, they had style, fame, and the musical talent to go along with that.  It is unfortunate they did not last into the 1990s.  Their greatest hits showcases their best songs such as &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; which hit number 1 and was the last hit before they broke up.  My two favorite songs on the album are &quot; Walking down Your Street&quot; and &quot;Walk Like and Egyptian&quot;.  This album brings back a lot of memories from the late 1980s.  If you like the Bangles, they have reunited and are supposedly touring soon. Lets Hope! Anyways this album is great and you should buy it.
B000066C1N|5.0|This is a very up beat CD!  If you are missing the eighties and nineties type music, you will love this CD.  It is long and is great inspirating house cleaning music!  About a quarter of the songs on the CD are just instrumental, but boy they are great.  I am not a classical/instrumental fan at all, but I sure like it!  The music is much more meaningful once you have seen the movie.  I highly recommend both.  Several of my friends have bought the CD after listening to mine.  By the way, Amazon is the cheapest place to get it!  I'm kind of glad now that I went to see Spirit with my nephews just for the music I found.
B00004W52U|5.0|this CD is probably the best i own, and the only cd besides MxPx's Let it Happen that i can sit and listen to the whole way through. This Cd is solid from beginning to end, from the anthem of &quot;Knowledge&quot; to the surfer type almost reggei (not sure of spelling) chords of &quot;Sound System&quot; through the just awesome &quot;Unity&quot; and on and on. If you don't own it buy it, and if you do go listen to it now.
B0000070QS|5.0|What an amazing voice.  Beautiful songs that you will absolutley get lost in. What a shame most of the US has never heard this music.  Thank God I have!

B000024KBZ|4.0|&quot;Big Thing&quot; is the second Duran Duran album since Roger and Andy Taylor left the lineup, and it's also the group's first flop.  While it spawned the Top Ten &quot;I Don't Want Your Love&quot; and the lesser hit &quot;All She Wants Is,&quot; this album was cooly received by the public, who didn't find it as accessible as &quot;Rio&quot; or &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger.&quot;  But you have to at least give Simon, Nick and John credit for being experimental, as they come up with some really good material on &quot;Big Thing.&quot;  &quot;Too Late Marlene&quot; is a sorely overlooked album cut, while the compelling tribute to Andy Warhol &quot;Do You Believe in Shame&quot; was virtually ignored by all but the group's diehard fans. And &quot;Palomino&quot; is a straight-up goregous ballad.  But the crowning moment is &quot;The Edge of America&quot; which leads up to the disc's closer, &quot;Lake Shore Driving.&quot;  Simon was particularly disappointed with the lackluster sales of this record, but it's not too late to visit this underrated album which proves that Duran Duran were much more than a bunch of photogenic Brits who made flashy videos.
0060989157|5.0|I grabbed it on my way out of the bookstore as an impulse buy hoping to not be disipointed. And I wasn't at all. I am a huge Crue fan from the beginning and this is exactly what I needed.  From the minute I picked it up I couldnt put it down until I was finished 2 days later.  There was a lot of insight to who they really where. I was suprized though on how much crying that Tommy did twords the end. Makes him sound like an emotional Pu**y who can't deal with life.  &quot;Dude get away from the thereapists.&quot; And Suprized on how much of the book was dedicated to Nikki which I didn't ever think he was a geek. Just funny how he didn't know how to go out on a date with a hot chick any more after he had been all f**ked over!<br />It was great I'll probably read it again
B000002V1D|4.0|Ten years following the release of the hit album &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger,&quot; Duran Duran release its seventh studio album in the hope that they will regain the popularity they once had in the 1980s.  It worked, if only for the short term.  The single &quot;Ordinary World&quot; is a compelling ballad about the willingness to move on from a broken relationship, while the catchy &quot;Come Undone&quot; works as a mid-tempo dance number.  &quot;Too Much Information&quot; is a scathing commentary on selling your soul to fame, while &quot;None of the Above&quot; is a funky number that vaguely recalls Chic.  Yes, there are clunkers: &quot;UHF&quot; and the dubious cover of &quot;Femme Fatale.&quot;  But these are small gripes.  &quot;Duran Duran&quot; was ample proof to the masses that they weren't just an 1980s band and featured some of the group's strongest material.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Wow...that's all I need to say about this film, but being the huge Spidey fan that I am I will say even more. The story follows a young man named Peter Parker. He's a brilliant young man, but is picked on and considered a 'geek' at school. He strives for the attention of the girl he has loved since 'before he even liked girls' (as he said in the film), Mary Jane Watson. On a school field trip, Peter is bitten by a genetically altered spider, and the results are history. The next morning he finds that he has amazing powers. He can leap higher than a normal man, he has incredible strength, he can climb walls like a spider, he can spin webs from his wrists, he has amazing reflexes, amazing speed and balance, and a 'spider sense' that warns him of danger before it happens. At first he uses his powers to achieve his own personal gain, but when tragedy strikes he learns that with great power must come great responsibility, and he decides to use his powers to help people. But soon, his best friend's dad, Norman Osborne, preforms an experiment on himself that increases his strength but drives him to insanity. He becomes the Green Goblin and now Spider-Man's vow to help people is put to the ultimate test.<br />This film is truly incredible from the opening credits to the ending credits. Both kids and adults will love this film. The special effects are...amazing, I couldn't even tell what was real and what wasn't in terms of CGI. And in my final sentence I'd like to say....GO SEE THIS FILM YOU WILL LOVE EVERY SECOND OF IT!!!!! I know I did.
0553103547|4.0|The first book in George Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire is a true example of &quot;political fantasy&quot;, much like the Daughter of the Empire trilogy.<br />While this book begins quite dull, the plot turns in many surprising ways. Martin is not afraid of using very, let's say, unconventional grips to make the story advance. The plot is nevertheless, or perhaps because of that, more plausible than the mentioned trilogy.<br />The only thing that can be held against this collosal epic is the lack of magic and other elements of fantasy. Most of the time it feels like medival-story with a new map, save from a few direwolves. Only at the end does a few things show up, but Martin does not integrate them as well as Robert Jordan.
6303364438|2.0|Probably the best thing in this movie is actress Laura Gemser. Alas, she is totally miscast.  The movie is depraving, gory and shows a madman who sadistically survives despite being bawdy, <BR>overly-lavish and shrewd.  Anyone Caligula has the slighted hint is a betrayer suffers brutually.  Cowards bow down. One brave person lurks in the shadows while Caligula rapes a young girl and then blames her incident on others.<br />The McDowell version was first. It should be seen, only if for the fact that while longer, something can be taken away. To [occupy] a night, rent Haughton and have a good chaser handy.<br />Dr. Alan D. Kardoff
6305090564|2.0|Stephen Sommer's oh-how agonisingly-predictable monster movie (which owes a lot to James Cameron's ALIENS) is as un-original as they come. Blunty, it's a rehash of of the old corny &quot;monster at sea&quot; movies. Nothing suprised me, except for a couple of impressive special effects. And did anyone mention plausability? This is so uninvolving and lacklustre it borders on the excremental. Only some inventive stuff with that gooey creature offing people eliviated my interest, but the rest is boring drivel.
B00005OAIE|2.0|I bought this CD on the strength of &quot;83,&quot; which is a marvelous song. Unfortunately, the other cuts don't live up to its promise. The overall sound is very appealing, but the lyrics don't really reward a close listen; in fact, they're whiny and repetitive.<br />This would be fine played at low volume in a restaurant, but it's not very interesting to actually *listen* to.
B00005QCYC|5.0|Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster is still the best of the Jurassic trilogy, and the film retains all the amazement and anticipation it had when it was first released.<br />Taken from Michael Crichton's thrilling novel, Jurassic Park is one Spielberg's most expertly-crafted films. The special effects are from FX maestro Stan Winston, who did the special effects for Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2 (1991). The seamless combination of CGI and robotic creatures creates some truly terrifying action set- pieces.<br />Despite what some critics thought when the film was released, I feel that all the principal actors give good performances, especially Sam Neill as Alan Grant and Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm. But admittedly, the dinosaur creations are the main attraction, and Winston's monsters (which won him another Oscar after Terminator 2) are truly frightning. Great entertainment.<br />The Lost World is an exciting adventure starring Jeff Goldblum, Vince Vaughn, Julianne Moore and Pete Postlethwaite. The film picks up four years after the incident at Jurassic Park, where a corporate businessman Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) plans to take dinosaurs off the second island (Isla Sorna, where dinosaurs have been breeding) and bring them to a theme park in San Diego.<br />Spielberg knows what the audience wants; the film has more dinosaurs, even better CGI and impressive animatronic dinosaurs from the maestro Stan Winston. The action throughout the film is exciting and while not as astonishing as Jurassic, the effects are first-rate. Although the action is good, the story isn't one of Spielberg's best. That said, the principal cast are fine, especially Goldblum as Malcolm (&quot;Ooh, aah, that's how it always starts, and then later the running and screaming&quot;) and Postewaite as Roland Tembo, a game hunter intent on shooting one of the Tyrannosaurs. Silly in parts, it's still an exciting adventure movie, with enough action and light humour to satisfy audiences.<br />Joe Johnston, taking over the reigns from Spielberg, has created an adventure that starts off quickly and hardly ever lets up. Sam Neill, returning to the role which made him famous in the original, is a stronger presence than in the first Jurassic, and the supporting cast of William H. Macy and Tea Leoni manage not to get lost amidst the barrage of CGI dinosaurs. The special effects are, of course the main stars, with Stan Winston's excellent dinosaurs surpass the ones for the original. And the plot (a bunch of people get stuck on an island with dangerous dinosaurs) provides plenty of great scares (a scene with nasty pterodactyls is the high-point) and fast-paced action to satisfy audiences. Great fun.<br />The trilogy DVD extras are first- rate, with superb picture and sound for all the discs. The special features are exceptional, with a 50 minute 'making of' of the film. Most interesting, however, is the footage of early pre-production meetings with Spielberg and the FX team discussing how certain shots and effects should be done. Also there are storyboards, production photos and web links.<br />The extras for The Lost Wolrd are fantastic, with a comprehensive 'making of', deleted scenes, trailers and ton of production info. The highlight on the JP3 Disc is the Commantary from the special effects team of Stan Winston, Michael Lantieri and some of the crew. Also, you get a series of 'making of's and trailers. Best of all is Disc 4 &quot;Beyond Jurassic Park&quot; featuring over two hours of never-before-available bonus material from all three films. Excellent entertainment that is a must-have for Jurassic fans.Johnston, taking over the reigns from Spielberg, has created an adventure that starts off quickly and hardly ever lets up.

B000059PR5|4.0|This movie may or may not be accurate (the disclaimer at the end of the movie says it is an actual *under*statment of what would happen).<br />I saw this movie the last time about twelve years ago.  Apparently, it is set off by Soviets invading and nuking Germany, eliciting a US response that results in the holocaust of the movie.  The scenes are graphic and the first airburst in front of the camera happens almost without warning and with a loud thunderclap sound.  What follows is some of the most unnerving footage I have ever seen, showing the immediate effects in horrifying detail.<br />It is a very good movie (wish it would come out on DVD), but it is not for the weak-hearted.
0446604844|4.0|Balducci writes in a simplistic style with few multi-syllable words which may give one the impression he is not especially intellectual, however I think he does this because he has learned in the publishing industry that faster and easier reads sell better. There were flashes of brilliance buried here and there in some turns of phrase. He probably could easily write at a higher level if there was a market for it, but today's standards are what they are. I was slightly annoyed at first at the short sentences and lack of inspired descriptive phraseology, but if the reader has a good imagination, it is easy to fill in the blanks. The story line seemed slow at first, the plot a bit convoluted and murky, but as it developed like a ray of sunshine emerging from a clouded sky, it became more interesting. I felt the character of Jason Archer was a bit two dimensional and his motives unclear so the reader was disinterested in his fate. However, Sydney, his wife and a lawyer with definite conflicts of interest, evolved into a strong protagonist and carried the story well. I found little suspense in general until the last few chapters, but that is normal for many books in this genre. My biggest criticism was the unrealistic fight scenes and gunplay toward the end. Obviously the author has never actually been involved first hand with this type of thing, yet there is no question he created a mood of suspense at that point. Also, no FBI agent would ever be allowed such aberrations from obeying the law during an investigation as did the supposedly experienced character who became infatuated with Sydney. But I did find as I stuck with it, the story became involving, the premise interesting and imaginative, a timely example of corporate greed, skulduggery and blackmail that escalates out of hand. Balducci obviously researched computer skills, knows the corporate jungle fairly well and writes in a relatively clear linear style without those annoying flashbacks that some authors seemto think are necessary. I would reccommend this book to fans of mystery fiction as an entertaining read and worth the effort.<BR>-Barker Reviews
B000066F6H|1.0|This album is a piece of Sh@t.  I generally like throwback groups, but THE Hives blow.  Listen to a band like the Vibrators...they did it much better and they did it 20 years ago.  I want my money back.
B000067JHW|5.0|Amelie is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life!!! I think this movie is filled with great music and artistic background as well as taste. If you loved the movie you should really listen to the soundtrack it hasn't left my cd player since my friend lent it to me.  And who cares about sub titles when a movie like this is definetly something that wont be forgotten for a long time!
B000068QVN|5.0|If you were a fan of the real GFR, then this is a great CD for you. I was 17 and full of hormones when I attended a Grand Funk Railroad concert in 1970. The 1971 tour was the last of the GFR I loved to listen to. Legal squabbles between the band and the band's producer effectively took all the music from the first albums released by GFR off the market and out of their control. After they regrouped, the music was just not the same-songs like &quot;We're an American Band&quot; does not compare to &quot;Inside Looking Out&quot; or &quot;Into the Sun&quot;. Essentially, we are hearing music that have not been available for many years. So, unless you are old enough to remember these songs, you have not heard the real GFR. Technically speaking, people forget that recording live concerts in 1971 was not very sophisticated. Most live recordings from the period are just not that good soundwise even with the current digital processes to clean them up. This release does as good of job as can be expected but don't try to compare it to todays standards of live recordings. Musically, this is the ultimate representation of what made this band famous-in your face guitar, bass and drums with no fancy stuff. I liked it then and I like it now. Turn it up and enjoy yourself-you are not as old as you think.
B000003BDY|5.0|i bought this album when it first came out (1965?).  bought it  on cd recently and was reminded how good it was/is. in fact, my friends and i used to consider the stones' first 5 albums a sort of &quot;Old Testament&quot;of 60's british invasion r&amp;b.  check out &quot;confessin the blues&quot; and &quot;its all over now&quot; in particular.
B000068QY7|3.0|You know, i was psyched when i got this, and maybe i'll come around in a year or two after i've listened to it a million times, but this album seems a step down.  <br />There are some nice tracks on here - hindu times, little by little come to mind - but it sounds more like a collection of b-sides and odds and ends.  i thought &quot;Standing On...&quot; was a pretty decent album, definitely back on track at least, but this is not the return to glory i was expecting (and no, i'm not pining for another version of wonderwall...).  Believe me, i'll be one of the first to pat the Gallagher brothers &amp; co. on the back - esp. Noel b/c he's a genius and probably pulls most of the weight in the band - but i have to be honest and say that this album was less than i expected given their last effort.  (and maybe that's a compliment, if you consider their last among their best)  <br />Still, not a bad album and obviously worth it if you like Oasis.
B000065U1N|1.0|\\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a good snapshot of what it's like to be in light infantry in what the Army euphemistically refers to as \\"Operations Other Than War.\\"  Very graphic in depicting what can happen when little things go wrong in these sorts of operations.  However as a holistic story of what happened to the men of Task Force Ranger that Sunday night in Mogadishu, it's sadly incomplete.  Little effort is made in setting up the stage as to why the Rangers were in Somalia, and it completely ignores the aftermath of the fight...  even to the point of leaving you hanging and wondering if CW3 Durant ever got away from the Somalians :-(<br />As a shoot 'em up war movie, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is hard to beat.  If you're looking for the story of what happened in Somalia and the lessons that can be learned from that sad experience, skip the movie and get Bowden's book.
0446677450|4.0|Like the author's &quot;Poor Dad&quot;, my father came from the school of study hard, get into a solid career, and work hard. While there is nothing wrong with taking this path, in today's volatile world, it is no guarantee for fulfillment, stability, or success. <br />There are many people out there who work extremely hard at their jobs, but in the end, are still living in debt or are one paycheck away from the downward spiral.<br />RICH DAD, POOR DAD opened my eyes to another path. The book is chockful of intuitive and helpful advice for generating wealth. Indeed, I believe the author's main objective was to recalibrate the reader's mindframe towards work, money, how to make money efficiently, and how to grow money profitably.<br />One detraction I had with the book is that it is not as structured and organized as it could've been. <br />He presents much of his material as folksy anecdotes and matter-of-fact aphorisms. He could have designed his chapters as a comparative analysis between his Rich Dad and Poor Dad, for example, CHAPTER 8: RICH DAD ON MORTGAGES, etc.<br />A detraction I have with the writer is his carefree tone in executing his real estate deals. If it were only that easy to turnover a distressed property into a profitable one!!<br />Having said that, I think this is a really good book for financial neophytes everywhere.
0316666343|5.0|Unlike many of the other reviewers on this site, I had heard nothing about this book before its release.  I did, however, notice it was one of the bestsellers before the release date, so I was eager to purchase it when it hit the shelves.  From the first paragraph, I was engulfed in Susie's world.  The main character is so \\"real,\\" even though she's dead at the novel's onset.  I couldn't put it down and was sad to see it end.<br />I did note two downsides:  a bit of a hard-to-believe cross between the dead and the living (akin to an X-Files script) toward the end and a lack of closure with the killer.  I wanted to see more of the investigation and an arrest.  <br />I strongly recommend this book!!!  I can't think of one of my friends who wouldn't enjoy it.
B00001PE4D|3.0|I am a big Sarah Michelle Gellar fan, and I am obsessed with \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", so naturally I would have to see this movie.  I thought that it had a good cast, ok plot, and managed to tie in some funny gags.  However, I think the film tried to hard with the whole revenge theme.  It's ok to see this movie once or twice, but it's not worth buying.
B000063S6Z|4.0|I bought '18' while on bit of a 'Play' high, so at first, it struck me how un-'Play'-ful it was.  It left a rather ambiguous taste in my mouth, but as I listened to it more, I found myself growing attached to it in a completely different way than I was to 'Play'.  Now granted, I did like 'Play' more  (or, more specifically, liked more songs on 'Play'), but that doesn't keep '18' from having some real charmers.  &quot;Extreme Ways&quot; and &quot;In My Heart&quot; have a hidden energy that is more felt than heard, &quot;Signs Of Love&quot; and especially &quot;18&quot; (my personal favorite) are borderline ethereal, and &quot;Great Escape&quot; is a simple song with simple harmonies.  Basically, '18' is one to listen to when you're feeling a 'lil down, with songs that kind of just stand next to you, pat you on the back and say &quot;I'm here for you, man&quot;.
B000067CPX|1.0|I realize artists evolve and change over time...we have seen the Chili Peppers do just that.  However, this is a departure from all that I felt the Chili Peppers stood for. The title track is a deceitful opening to this mellow CD.  By the way, where's the funk? By the way, where's the edge? By the way, where's Chad? By the way, where's Flea? By the way, what were you thinking, Rick Ruben?  By the way, where's the boundary pushing?  Maybe that's it, they are pushing the boundaries by not pushing the boundaries.  I hope this is not their last album and they redeem themselves with another - quickly!  If you liked Freaky Styley, Mother's Milk, Blood Sugar Sex Magic, Californication don't bother.  If you like the GooGoo Dolls, however, have a listen.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril's CD is a delightful mix of punk, rock, pop that combines to become one of the best CD's I have ever listened to!  I cant totally relate to her youthful song lyrics because she sings about what's real and what she is going through.  I love the song 'I'm With You', its a little slower and the lyrics just floor you.  She also has plenty of fun songs, like 'My World' and 'Sk8ter Boi' that just make you want to get up and dance.  Her voice is strong and fits perfect with the music.  Overall, I just can't stop listening to this CD.  I almost know all the words by heart and I am sure that if you buy this CD, you will love it just as much as I do!
080010367X|5.0|After seeing the previews, I had no desire to see &quot;Men in Black.&quot;  It just looked silly and didn't make sense.  I finally watched it only because my boyfriend had the tape in his collection and I was bored.  Boy, did I misjudge this movie!  It was ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS!<br />Part of my problem with the previews is that I wasn't quite sure what the plot was about so let me start there.  The &quot;men in black&quot; are part of a special super-secret immigration agency dealing with extraterrestrials.  Unbeknownst to the general population, space aliens have been living amongst us for several decades.  As long as they behave, they are welcome.  If they misbehave, they may be deported or zapped with some pretty fancy weaponry.<br />Will Smith plays an ultra-hip New York police officer who comes to the agency's attention after chasing down a space alien.  Tommy Lee Jones plays his very experienced, suave partner.  Jones' dead serious interactions with the panoply of odd aliens is outrageous.  And although I'm not a Will Smith fan, I have to admit that in MIB he's just just too cool for words!<br />MIB is definitely a must for the video library!
1573921394|3.0|Keynes had a great economics mind, but little talent explaing it. The book is very hard to read due to convulated, odd grammer and very long, complicated sentences Keynes uses. The challange is understanding the language, rather than the ideas. <br />A typical sentence/paragraph from the book:<br />&quot;The fact that two incommensurable collections of miscellaneous objects cannot in themselves provide the material for a quantitive analysis need not, of course, prevent us from making approximate statistical comparisons, depending on some broad element of judgement rather than strict calculation, which may posses significance and validty within certain limits.<br />Sure.<br />This is the first book in years I gave up reading in the middle.<BR>Until someone rewrites the book for humans - avoid!
B00005JKQZ|1.0|Unfortunately, due to a type of treacherous nepotism in Hollywood, this mediocre movie won the honor which should not have been its due. Ron Howard has played Salieri to much more deserving directors, with the academy's approval. It will be quickly relegated to the \\"what was that movie about?\\" pile in a few years, just as Annie Hall has been. If it had not been awarded this undeserved high honor, it could have sunken into the obscurity which is its fate with a little dignity. Now it will always be remembered as the movie that made millions of people decide that Oscar was no longer believable and trust worthy enough to make it worth watching.
B0000028RR|2.0|I admire the unique sound of Rage Against the Machine, their lyrics are intelligent, they sound ragefull and many times have important things to say. I haven't listened to their most recent albums yet, but I finally got the self-titled, and with the exception of a couple of songs that stand well on their own, the album is weakly conceived. It is a very nice presentation for a first album - simple, direct, unaltered by excessive post-production, and with powerful, quotable statements such as: &quot;Yes I know my enemies/They're the teachers who taught me to fight me/compromise, conformity, assimilation, submission/Ignorance, hypocrisy, brutality, the elite/All of which are American dreams.&quot; &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; and &quot;Wake Up&quot; are two solid songs that provide the high point of the album, some of the other tracks are reasonably good, but &quot;Settle for Nothing&quot; leaves a large hole in what could have been at least a consistent album. It lacks tunes that complement each other, and ends up with little variation. If the arrangement was as well composed as the lyrics and the artwork, &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot; could have been a great first album for the band.
B000002NE4|4.0|This album with its spiritual imagery contains the odd anthemic ballad, like the rousing There Is A Kingdom, but mostly intimate, subdued songs like Into My Arms, Lime Tree Arbour and the resigned People Ain't No Good. Cave interweaves spiritual and sensual metaphor, much like Leonard Cohen. On Where Do We Go Now But Nowhere? one half expects those Cohenesque female vocals to frame his deep voice, but they're not there. My favorite is the weary and erotic Green Eyes, the first line of which is a translation of a sonnet by the medieval French poet Louise Lab&eacute;. She was the first to write sonnets in French (the style originated in Italy) and was known for her passionate themes. Cave then turns her love poem into a lament of epic proportions filled with equal amounts of romantic longing and despair. Quite a tour de force and enhanced by a strategic swear word or two. The poetic effect is greatly enhanced by the vocal technique: lines are first spoken then sung, which gives it a very ritualistic flavour. Fans of The Boatman's Call would love the albums \\"New Mother\\" and \\"How I Loved You\\" by Angels of Light, since these contain similar great melodic ballads of gravitas and solemnity.
0679879269|5.0|This book is an amazing conclusion to Philip Pullman's triology, 'His Dark Materials.'  This book has an astounding story line and great development through the whole novel.  I found my motivation for reading it slightly different than the first two books, 'The Golden Compass' and 'The Subtle Knife,' because this was it; everything that happened was crucial to the outcome of the plot and Will and Lyra's lives come to conclude.<BR>This book was brillant and wonderful to read.  My only negative remark is that this book is the last book, and I'll miss Lyra and Will.
0553208845|3.0|Let me take the liberty of saying that, unless you are into religion (Hinduism and Buddhism in particular), this is a rather boring/tedious novel. The development of the main character is too one-dimensional and I find Kamala and Govinda even more uninteresting than Siddhartha himself.<br />What I dislike the most about this novel is that it tends to eclipse everything else written by Hesse. I am looking right now at the Bantham Books edition and I see that it says on the front cover: \\"his most famous novel\\" and on the back it is written that \\"... Herman Hesse' most famous and influential work\\". I find these statements to the utmost misleading, because those who know anything about Hesse are aware of the fact that it was the Glass Bead Game that won him the Nobel Prize. It is his most monumental work and, truly one of the best novels of the 20-th century. However, I am not going to compare it with Siddhartha, because they are too different. Instead it would be easier to compare it with the Steppenwolf by Hesse.<br />Both novels have a clearly defined protagonist. However, Harry Haller from the Steppenwolf seems to be more flesh-made, interesting and easier to identify with than Siddhartha, because the Steppenwolf discusses an individual vs. society, while Siddhartha is centered exclusively around religion. What annoyed me the most in Siddhartha is that every move that he made was influenced by religion. Even his relationship with other people (Govinda, Kamala, his son and others) was dictated by religion. By no means I am trying to blame the author for that or say that it is a bad book; instead, it is the theme itself that imposed those restrictions. In Steppenwolf, even though there is a lot of grotesque, the protagonist is much more part of reality.<br />There is another novel by Hesse that I would rank higher than Siddhartha. It is called Demian. Although, it is a lot different from Siddhartha (completely different time, characters, setting), it is written in a similar vein as Siddhartha (at least, it is possible to tell that the two are written by the same author). I will make it bold to say that its two main characters, Max Demian and Emil Sinclair, are much more interesting to look at than Siddhartha.<br />To sum everything up, Siddhartha is merely a reflection of Hesse's interest in India. In fact, from Hesse's biography it is known that since he settled in Switzerland in 1919, if not to count brief departures to Italy and Germany, India is the only place he ever visited till his death in 1962. If I remember it right, Hesse wrote a few other books on India and the Hinduism, besides Siddhartha, but all of them put together are only a portion of his literary achievementssimilar vein as Siddhartha (at least, it is possible to tell that the two are written by the same author).

B000066NW0|5.0|Buy this album. If you are looking for catchy hooks with a refreshing voice, Avril Lavigne's debut album &quot;Let Go&quot; is for you. Like many female vocalists that are crowding the airwaves, Lavigne posseses all the tools to get you humming. The songs &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;I'm With You&quot; show Lavigne's ability to write music that will cater to anyone looking for a new anthem. &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; and &quot;Naked&quot; shows a mature side to Lavigne's music, and hides the fact that &quot;Let Go&quot; is this 17 year olds debut album. While she has a comfortable sound that could best be compared to Michelle Branch, she has more to offer. Edgy vocals and catchy guitar riffs fill this album, and put Lavigne a step above all the mass-produced female vocalists so many listeners have grown tired of. A contender for voice of the summer, Lavigne's debut &quot;Let Go&quot; is a must have.

B000067CPX|3.0|When I first listened to this album, I was expecting the traditional rock/punk heard in most of their other albums.  What I ended up getting many more mellow tunes then what i had been expecting.  It remindes me of how i listen to &quot;One hot Minute&quot;, where if i'm feeling a hankering, I can listen to a couple songs on the CD, but hardly the whole thing like i could with BSSM and Californication.  If i could i would give this album 3.5 stars but since i liked One hot minute a bit better i lowered it to three. <br />On that note, favorite songs are: On Mercury, by the way, Don't forget me (because the the bass carries the song), and midnight (only because the opening fits so well with the song and i kind of like the chourus.)
B00005A1PR|3.0|I was expecting something soulful and creative.  This cd is feather-light.  The lryics are slightly cliche and the chords get redundant after awhile.  It was hyped up way too much.  There is very little about it that is ground breaking.  It's a great CD for younger people though.  Positive and down to earth, it encourages an optimistic attitude.
B000056NX5|2.0|If you haven't  heard of Jesus Christ Superstar Buy the CD (see the lists they tell the truth) then the movie this  one is only for true JCS fans whom can hear past Jerome Pradón screaming & screaching through all the songs.  I sounded as if he was siging falsetto up to Alto He has a limited range.  Glen Carter was awesome but came up short in the falsetto Ted Nealy was 100 times better at falsetto  When Ted did it, it was strong and confident.  But Glen's falsetto seemed to fade and was unsure in Gethseneme.  Fred Johnsson was a great singer AWFUL actor! Herod sucks big time!  Annas is perfect!  Ciaphas shouldn't have raised his voice (Peter Gallagher is a better Bass)<br />1973         BETTER SINGING  NOT AS GOOD ACTING<br />2000         AWFUL ACTING    BETTER SINGING<br />1973's Singing + 2000's acting =  London cast from 1972<br />(I'm 13 but I heard it from my mom)
B00003CXPD|5.0|I always really wanted to see this movie because from the commercials on TV it looked really good. I was in dance myself for six years so that's one of the reasons I like it so much. But, it's so much more than the dancing. I got it at Target like 7 months ago because my mom and I couldn't find it anywhere to rent. I love the characters and situations in this movie. I'm so glad I got it because I watch it over and over again. Plus I bought the sountrack and had to have the Clash's &quot;London Calling&quot; CD. Thank you Billy Elliot now I have 4 Clash CD's and they are my favorite band all because London Calling was in the movie. GO SEE IT!
B000067CPX|5.0|This album is great!! A definite must have. Right now, Im addicted to 'Universally Speaking'. Overall, pretty mellow.
B00005JKCF|4.0|Spider-Man is the epitome of a summer action flick.  It doesn't have wonderful acting or a wonderful script, but it is interesting enough and loud enough to make it worth the money that you pay.<br />Tobey Maguire is wonderful as Peter Parker.  He's the perfect casting, creating a mix of shyness, naivet&eacute; and brooding after his uncle is killed.  It's hard to say how he is as Spider-Man himself, since he has so few lines.  But what we did see was pretty good.  He only made a couple of quips, which disappointed me a bit, since that's what Spider-Man is known for.  Hopefully, that was because he was still getting used to the superhero thing and will happen more in the second movie.<br />Kirsten Dunst is a great Mary Jane.  She runs the gamut between a flighty exterior while being extremely troubled inside.  It helps draw the male audience in, of course, that she's gorgeous in the role.  She doesn't have as big of a role as I would have liked, however.  She fulfills the love interest role admirably, but the script doesn't give her much to do besides that.  Hopefully that will also change in the next movie.  I did like how the movie ended between Peter and Mary Jane, though.  It was very appropriate to the character.<br />Willem Dafoe was the perfect Green Goblin as well.  He handles the scenes where he's arguing with himself exceptionally well.  A lesser actor would have sunk deep into the campiness of the role, but he holds his own.  The dialogue is still pretty bad, but Dafoe rises above it.  He is able to play both the sinister charm of Norman Osborn as well as the total insanity of the Green Goblin.<br />Those are the main characters, but I have to mention J.K. Simmons as the crotchety newspaper publisher, J. Jonah Jameson.  He fits the character in the comic to a T.  He simply steals the few scenes that he's in.  I don't know if the role was written quite right (I don't remember Jameson being that cruel to people like his wife), but Simmons hit a home run with what he was given.<br />The plot of the movie is your typical superhero action plot.  There's nothing really new here, but I was pleased to see how close they came to the actual comic plot.  There are some differences, of course, but it was very recognizable.  They kept true to the spirit of the characters for the most part, with only minor changes.  As a fan of the comics, I am very thankful. I think that had a lot to do with Sam Raimi's direction, which is also fabulous.<br />The main drawback of the film (besides the rather pedestrian plot) is the CGI effects.  There are too many times where it actually looks fake.  I know CGI isn't perfect, but it really throws you out of the movie when your eyes register the effect itself rather than the result of the effect.  The other drawback is James Franco, the guy who plays Harry Osborne.  He had no believability whatsoever, and he was very uninteresting.  I'm not sure if that was Franco or the way that Harry was written, but it didn't come across well at all.<br />Still, this is a great movie to see if you're just in the mood for a popcorn flick.

That should be a good indication.he was given.<br />The plot of the movie is your typical superhero action plot.  There's nothing really new here, but I was pleased to see how close they came to the actual comic plot.  There are some differences, of course, but it was very recognizable.  They kept true to the spirit of the characters for the most part, with only minor changes.   As a fan of the comics, I am very thankful. I think that had a lot to do with Sam Raimi's direction, which is also fabulous.<br />The main drawback of the film (besides the rather pedestrian plot) is the CGI effects.  There are too many times where it actually looks fake.  I know CGI isn't perfect, but it really throws you out of the movie when your eyes register the effect itself rather than the result of the effect.   The other drawback is James Franco, the guy who plays Harry Osborne.  He had no believability whatsoever, and he was very uninteresting.  I'm not sure if that was Franco or the way that Harry was written, but it didn't come across well at all.<br />Still, this is a great movie to see if you're just in the mood for a popcorn flick.

B00004TRD8|5.0|This is just the best ever.  T2 is one of the few movies I saw as a child (teenager actually) that still blows me away as an adult.  All the characters were cool and worked together well.  I loved watching the relationship between John and the Terminator grow into a solid friendship.  It was also cool watching Sarah overcome her prejudices against the Terminator and realize that he's really not the same as the one that tried to kill her 10 years earlier.  That liquid metal T-1000 was just about unstoppable and was pretty scary.<br />I remember being quite shaken by the scenes of the burning playground at the beginning of the film and by the nuclear holocaust scene.  They were very vivid and kinda frightening (I was only 13, remember).<br />As for the DVD itself, it has the clearest and best picture I've ever seen (there's really something to that THX stuff).  I love the DTS 5.1 sound.  It really seems like you're in a movie theater.<br />My fave version of the movie is still the theatrical version.  The 2 extended versions are overlong and none of the added footage is really necessary.  However the parts where the T-1000 are malfunctioning in the steel mill and melting into the floor could've been left in to show that he was starting to lose ground.<br />Also (pet peeve) the movie says John was 10 (in the police computer readout), but this is a mistake.  In the first movie Sarah was 6 months pregnant with John in November 84 and then gave birth to him February 85.  The 2nd movie is set in the summer of 94 (because the Terminator told John that his future self reprograms him 35 years from that time; 1994 + 35 = 2029).  Therefore John is only 9 and will be 10 in February 95, but that's just a small pet peeve.  Overall, it's the best DVD ever.
0061020680|5.0|Mort, the 4th Discworld book by Terry Pratchett, is one of the funniest Discworld books out there.  It's a hilarious book that's missing some of the social commentary that permeates his books later in the series.  You don't miss it, though, as you continue to laugh out loud at some of the shenanigans.  Only a weak ending prevents it from being the best book of the bunch.<br />Death takes on an apprentice. Mort, the unlucky chosen one, has a bit of trouble settling into his role.  It's not very fun to be present when people leave the mortal coil.  One time, however, he spies a princess (who can actually see him as well, even though people aren't supposed to be able to) and is very attracted to her.  Unfortunately for him, this attraction leads him to try and change the course of destiny, and Mort finds that it's a lot harder to do then it looks.  The princess finds out that it's quite hard to live when you're supposed to be dead.  Death doesn't seem to notice all of this as he's busy trying to experience humanity.  But when he finds out, Mort may wish he hadn't.<br />I really enjoyed this book.  Death has always been my favourite character in Pratchett's books, so I decided to start reading the books that are actually about him.  Mort is the first, and I can now see why I've always liked the character.  Death has a dry wit about him, but he's always matter-of-fact when he's doing his job.  He tries to impart that onto Mort, with limited success. I like the fact that he always speaks in capital letters LIKE THIS, thus giving him a real presence when you read him.  It's even better when he's out learning about humanity, sitting in a bar and lamenting about the fact that he has no friends.  The dissonance between this very human feeling and his powerful voice is really neat.<br />The other characters in Mort are also wonderful.  There's Ysabell, Death's adopted daughter who he's obviously trying to pair Mort with.  She's feisty, never slipping into the stereotypical female role.  Albert shines as Death's servant, a man who's not all he appears to be.  When things finally let loose with Albert, it's both powerful and funny how it happens.  There's Keli, the princess that Mort tries to save.  She's a petulant child, even more so when people can't seem to remember that she's not supposed to be living.  Finally, there's Cutwell, the wizard that Mort enlists to help him learn to walk through walls and Keli employs to make people remember her.  All of these characters are complete and well-rounded, with none of them missing a beat.  Their interactions are marvelous and the jokes come out of the characters rather than at the expense of the characters.  Heck, even Rincewind, the incompetent wizard from the first books, makes an appearance!<br />There's more to this book than the characters, though.  The plot is simple, but very good.  While there's not much commentary in this book, it does make a bit of a statement about how powerful an emotion love can be.  It also shows what a curse being human can be, as Death loses himself in the experience.  He even lowers himself to become a fry cook at one point, just to see what it's like.  No insult intended to fry cooks, but when you're the anthropomorphic projection of an aspect of life, then you have lowered yourself when you start working a kitchen.  The plot moves quickly, with little padding.  There are no unnecessary characters placed in the book just to make a joke, which is a sin Pratchett starts to commit in later books.  When somebody appears, you know they're going to have an impact.<br />The only bad thing about this book is the ending.  It's very arbitrary, and seems to go against the rest of the book.  It seems to come out of nowhere, just being used as an excuse to end the book.  The final conflict is resolved way too quickly and neatly.  It's almost like Pratchett knew how he wanted to end the book, but couldn't figure out how to get there.  It makes sense, but only if you reacha bit.<br />Still, it's well worth the time spent getting to the ending.  The jokes are great, Death is wonderful and you'll really love reading about him.  I can't wait to read the next Death book and see what happens.  This book is a wonderful place to start your Discworld experience, being the start of a subset within the Discworld series.  You won't regret it.a bit.<br />Still, it's well worth the time spent getting to the ending.  The jokes are great, Death is wonderful and you'll really love reading about him.

B00005K3OT|5.0|This is a beautiful movie.  Its rich and sensual as chocolate.  I love the classic look of it; Its very french yet not weird to the american audience.  Binoche is beautiful and sensual and perfect as the new woman in town.  A must have for your DVD library.
B00003CXI1|2.0|Loved the books, loved the audio books even more, but despite the stellar cast, this movie came across as inept. It's a prime example of how blue screen digital derring-do can fall flat on its face. The computer backgrounds were uneven, at times almost cartoonish, and the special effects weren't always that special, from the first look at the outside of Hogwarts to the fake-n-bake Quidditch match. Not seeing some of the best parts of the book was a bit disappointing, but that wasn't the main problem with the movie. It's almost always necessary to eliminate some book episodes to keep the cinema pace moving. What grated the most was the ineptness of the not-so-special effects crew. Truly grade C.
B000063K2W|5.0|A bit about me I am 30 and I love old Hollywood glamor. And what could be more glamorous than Norma Shearer??<br />Well the rest of the cast looks great too. This very unique film is an all female cast (even the animals are female only. Yet this story of adultery and actually enjoyable catty women (there cattiness is cleaver and witty) is not based on only women. The men in their lives are very prominently. And though not shown on screen you will imagine these guys interacting with these women with vivid detail. I just can not describe this very cleaver film enough to do it justice. I had no idea about the all female cast when I first saw it, and I am glad I might have thought it was a cheap gimmick. Trust me it works. Only truly wonderful writing could make this seem as if there are male parts in it. You forget that there aren't, and might not even notice it was a female only cast if I hadn't told you. <br />This film is marvelous and glamorous and you would want to be as beautiful as Mary Haines (actress Norma Shearer) herself.<br />Gorgeous clothes and wonderful lives... the way Classic old Hollywood Studios can make us wish desperately that they were our  lives. <br />This is a film to be seen over and over. It is very funny, cleaver, and a sheer delight. I am not a girly girl type of gal I prefer Sci Fi and Action films, but my one weakness is well made classic films. And this is definitely one! Buy your copy, I did. :o)
B000067CPX|1.0|Ok, this is a joke. Very funny. Now where's the real new RHCP CD??<BR>There's not one good song on this CD, it's all terrible mainstream stuff. These guys are apparently getting old and bored.<BR>Don't waste your money on this one...
B000006OS2|3.0|Madacy and Goodtimes VHS tapes and DVDs are low quality ... Do not buy them. They look worse than taping off tv or if the look ok they sound like an old cassette recording with metallic  squeals.<br />I have the VHS (not Goodtimes) that was put out by John Wayne's estate. It is gorgeous. I wish they would do the DVD too. :( I love this film, and want to buy it on DVD but Goodtimes and Madacy are truly so bad that it looks like a pirated copy from off tv. ...  If you have to have this movie as I did. Buy this VHS. It is waaay better in quality.
B00005O3VC|4.0|First of all, I'd like to say that if I were rating the movie itself and not the DVD...It would get 5 stars hands down.  Monty Python and the Hold Grail is by far the funniest movie ever.  There is no other franchise in history that could pull off having a bloody knight with no limbs, or a French taunter without just being ridiculously un-funny.  Monty Python gets the job done perfectly and should be seen by all.  Ok, now back to the DVD.  There are a bunch of special features, but for the most part they're long, drawn out, and not funny.  But that's ok...they're just extras.  The problem that I have with the DVD itself is that it doesn't play correctly (or at all) on some DVD players.  The encoding is just a little off.  But the amount of improvement in the quality of the picture and sound are great, and all in all it's a great DVD thatI'd recommend to just about anyone!
0380789035|3.0|American Gods is a dense work, a compendium of mythology both past and present.  It was not as accessible as his other books, specifically &quot;The Neverwhere&quot; nad &quot;Good Omens&quot; and not as enjoyable.  The tone of this novel is much darker and I miss the humor of his previous works.  Still it is an interesting read and I guess it may work better if the reader had solid background in Norse, Slavic, Egyptian, etc mythology, which I do not.
B00005JL0I|5.0|Finally, a re-release of this film! \\"Casino Royale\\" is the best '60s spy film I ever saw. An outstanding cast and lots of familiar faces, wonderful score, amazing special effects, groovy<BR>girls, and lots of comedy. Although, I'm happy about this re-release, it's not in the right format I'm looking for. MGM is about to release the DVD but not a VHS. Does that make sense? I don't own a DVD player, and I'm pleased about this re-release. If MGM can put a new DVD copy out, they can make a VHS. PLEASE put a new VHS version out!!
B00003CXHJ|3.0|This fictional account of how the allies seized the \\"Enigma\\" coding device (a historically accurate NAZI coding system) is worth the watch.<br />Of course, it could be a little boring considering it occurs inside of submarines... no windows... no amazing scenery.... but the essence of the struggle is well preserved.<br />Give it go.... or at least a rental.
B000002C25|5.0|When it was released, Be Here Now was greeted by rapturous reviews and unbelievable sales (885,000 copies sold in Britain that week, the equivalent of 4-5 million copies in a week here).  Within a couple of months (largely due, in my opinion, to the comparative brilliance of OK Computer and Urban Hymns) Be Here Now was reviled as a cocaine excess and Oasis' short reign as the biggest group in the world was over.  Oasis certainly has never recovered.  But this is a great album, full of long, loud songs that never forget the importance of a great tune.  Sure, the lyrics are naff but who cares when they're being sung by the best singer of his generation, Mr. Liam Gallagher (except for Magic Pie, a top song despite the absolute worst, most pretentious lyrics ever).  I'm not going to go through the strengths and weaknesses of each song (others have done it better) but let me just point out three songs:<BR>1.  Do You Know What I Mean?  A massive, massive song, the first new Oasis song to follow the trailblazing Morning Glory album.  This song is so 1997 but still conjures up a feeling of companionship, the idea that we're all in this together.  Just awesome.<BR>2.  Fade In-Out:  Not everyone loves it but this song really is the missed opportunity for Oasis, their chance to truly become the Stone Roses of the nineties.  But Oasis zigged when they should have zagged, going mellow when it was time to rock out.  But at least we have this song.  The scream three minutes into the song is one of the most exciting moments in rock and roll.  <BR>3.  Don't Go Away:  I'll never understand why this one didn't strike the same chord as Wonderwall.  If it had gotten the airplay it deserved, this album wouldn't be considered such a flop.  Beautiful with Liam's voice keeping it from being too sentimental (a problem in the last couple of Oasis albums where Noel's decided to take on more of the singing duties).
B00001QEE8|5.0|After watching this movie with my kids after not having seen it for many years, I realized how great this movie was and is.   Sure, the animation is not up to the technology of CGI or other advances of today, but the story and songs are unsurpassed.   \\"I wanna be like you\\" is still my all-time favorite song and movie scene!!!
B00005214X|4.0|For sure this is George's masterpiece. I have the original on cd and was willing to shell out for the remastered edition, so that pretty much says how much I appreciate this cd.<br />The sound is much improved. I don't personally care for the colored cover and the way they packaged the cd's within. It's difficult to get the discs out of the cardboard holders. Minor complaint.<br />I never enjoyed ATMP intellectually or spiritually (George's mystical beliefs were not mine). And the lyrics are not all that outstanding, which the digitally remastered disc makes all too evident. But what made this cd work thirty years ago and thirty plus years later is Spector's Wall Of Sound. This cd is truly an emotional high of highs. It makes George's voice almost silken as voice and sound weave back and forth. The one thing George did great on ATMP is the power of the music he delivers. I can listen to particular songs over and over and still want to hear more after I take the headphones off.<br />My favorite tracks: &quot;I'd Have You Anytime,&quot; &quot;Wah-Wah,&quot; &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot; x 2, &quot;Beware Of Darkness&quot;, and &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; (my favorite cut). &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; has a great beat but the lyrics turn me off.<br />The added songs are so so. The new version of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; lacks any energy. I also prefer the order of the songs in the original. The jam sessions are absolute junk, as they were thirty years ago. Just because big names jam together doesn't make for a good jam session. Almost every LP had some fillers and this was Georges.<br />If you like the original buy this remastered version. Worth paying for it twice.
B00004RFFS|5.0|\\"Interview With the Vampire\\" is a grand, spectacular, over the top movie, based on the first book in Anne Rice's seemingly endless \\"Vampire Chronicles\\". When it was released in 1994, it was reviled by some critics and audiences members. But I suggest that Ms. Rice's books are the types that do not lend themselves easily to being translated to the screen. Consider, for example, the feeble, atrocious movie made from Rice's \\"Queen of the Damned\\" in 2002. I think the producers of \\"Interview\\" took the right approach by using the old-fashioned, overblown approach. In this sense, it reminds me of older `classics' like \\"The Ten Commandments\\" [1956], \\"Ben-Hur\\" [1959] and \\"Dr. Zhivago\\" [1965] - movies so sumptuous that any attempt to debate their `literary' merits is virtually pointless. Such epics are designed to amaze and to entertain. That is exactly what \\"Interview\\" does. <br />To me, it's main fault is its casting of Tom Cruise as Lestat, a move the author public decried, although she later retracted her criticism. But she was heavily invested in the project, both as its script writer and as a profit participant. I, of course, am not, being just a simple moviegoer. I really like Mr. Cruise in certain roles, but, in my mind's eye, Lestat he is not. Though he wasn't quite old enough or famous enough at the time, I can picture Jude Law as Lestat. Or Ethan Hawke, perhaps. Maybe even Nicholas Cage. This casting error is partially offset by Brad Pitt's Louis. He is absolutely the right actor. In fact, he, too, would have been a decent Lestat. Nearly stealing the movie from the two megastars is Kirsten Dunst. About twelve years old at the time, she is unbelievable good as Claudia, the child vampire. Time has proven that Ms. Dunst's performance was no fluke. Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea are fun as Santiago and Armand. <br />I think director Neil Jordan had a rough time on the set of this movie. While he did an admirable job, I think his forte is rightly smaller, character driven pictures such as \\"Mona Lisa\\", \\"The Crying Game\\" and \\"The End of the Affair\\". Composer Elliot Goldenthal contributed a powerful music score. Much of the dazzling look of the film is the work of cinematographer Phillipe Rousselot, whose other work includes \\"Dangerous Liaisons\\", \\"The Emerald Forest\\" and \\"La Reine Margot\\". Production designer Dante Ferretti also worked on \\"Titus\\", \\"The Age of Innocence\\" and \\"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\\". <br />I think that the people who conceived \\"Interview\\" as a movie were determined to give it a both an expensive look and a timeless quality. If so, they succeeded. This helps enormously to overcome something that is inherent to all \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\": The characters and their tales are both hauntingly beautiful and decidedly repulsive. It is this contradiction in both the books and this movie that makes one either an ardent fan or a detractor.
B000067CPX|4.0|Ive been a big fan of the chili peppers for a long time now... I have 5 peppers cds, bssm, what hits?,mothers milk, californication, and now by the way.  By the way has many more \\"slow\\" and emotional songs, such as the zephyr song, and midnight...but dont get me wrong, these songs are pretty good.  If i had to rate all the songs, this is how it would go:<BR>1.  By the way (4 stars)<BR>2.  Universally speaking (4 stars)<BR>3.  This is the place (3 stars)<BR>4.  Dosed (4 stars)<BR>5.  Dont forget me (2.5 stars)<BR>6.  The zephyr song (3.5 stars)<BR>7.  cant stop (4.5 stars)<BR>8.  I could die for you (3 stars)<BR>9.  midnight (2 stars)<BR>10.  throw away your television (4 stars)<BR>11.  Cabron (2 stars)<BR>12.  Tear (5 stars)<BR>13.  On mercury (4.5 stars)<BR>14.  Minor thing (3 stars)<BR>15.  Warm tape (2 stars)<BR>16.  venice queen (4 stars)<BR>so as you can see most of the songs are very good, but i can see how many old peppers fans could be dissapointed by this cd with the lack of funk that the peppers have given to us.  well i hope this review helps.
B00005MAM2|2.0|THE REASON I GAVE THIS DVD 2 STARS WAS BECAUSE OF THE BOUNUS MATERIAL ON THE SECOND DISC THAT COMES WITH IT.  DONT GET ME WRONG I'M A BIG AKIRA FAN BUT THE NEW ENGLISH VOICE OVERS TOTALLY RUINED THE MOVIE.  THE ACTING WAS HORRIBLE AND THE NEW VOICES DO NOT MATCH THE CHARACTERS AT ALL.

Harmony has been established as Woody and Buzz can now co-exist with one another, until Woody is kidnapped trying to save another toy.<br />This is a fun movie, even for adults. I do not even have children, but my wife and I were both able to enjoy this movie.<br />The voice work and artistry were well-done, topping Pixar's previous works, Toy Story and A Bug's Life. The work done by Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were well done, as always, but the addition of Wayne Knight, Joan Cusack and Kelsey Grammer to the cast, were good choices and they played the parts well.<br />This is a great movie for the kids, but there is enough to make this a guilty pleasure for the adults.

B000066NW0|5.0|Fresh picked from small town Napanee, Ontario and thrown live and kicking into<BR>the music biz is a young girl full of spunk and originality, Avril Lavigne. Her killer debut <BR>\\"Let Go\\" came out June 4th and has been climbing the charts ever since with her<BR>impressive first single \\"Complicated\\". Avril's real and down to earth lyrics have been<BR>inspiring and enlivening people both young and old. The songs are full of feeling and<BR>kick-ass musical style. \\"Anything But Ordinary\\", a song that completely describes this<BR>young musical sensation, also gives hope to those who are different and want to keep it<BR>that way. \\"Sk8er boi\\" is a song about looking below the surface and the after effects if<BR>you choose not to do so. Then there is her lighter side. Ballads like \\"I'm With You\\", \\"Too<BR>Much Too Ask\\" and \\" Things I'll Never Say\\" deal with the crushes, wonder and<BR>bewilderment of her life.<BR> She is unique and many salute her for it. In this world where fads are<BR>overpowering, cliques are uncontrollable and popularity is more important than ever<BR>seeing someone break out of the shell is a ray of hope for those of us striving for the<BR>difference. Avril knows the importance of her rare qualities. She also knows that she<BR>wants to have her enthusiastic youthful self untouched by press and media, her rebellious<BR>punk rock element secure, and her emotional side held together in order to gain success<BR>and will never want to bought or sold as anything other than herself.<BR> Avril's extensive vocal range has taken her great lengths and will bring her many<BR>more, but her unlimited musical styles, originality and wicked guitar inflamed tunes will<BR>make her journey a lot easier. Her attitude has made a permanent imprint on her listeners<BR>well. Very unlike her predecessors of pop she has an original sound entirely different to<BR>the technique of pop. She has a punk core, and alternative roots which brings up the<BR>question why she is consideredpop at all but if you read the fine print it will come up<BR>somewhere. With her pop sprinkled here and there like it is, this is one skater sundae<BR>that's hard to not like. <BR> So she will keep her tom-boy ways and lovable defiant traits, (not that anyone's<BR>complaining) and she will gain for herself musical experience that will grant her a lasting<BR>impression on mankind.

081541028X|5.0|Many of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo astronauts have written autobiographies but this is the only one that really describes what spaceflight is like, as experienced by the astronaut himself.  Mike Collins puts the reader right into the spacecraft alongside the author.  He also describes the training  the astronauts went through as well as short but colorful descriptions of his fellow astronauts.  It is indeed unfortunate that none of the twelve men who walked on the moon has written an account that is of the caliber of this book.   A reader interested in the Apollo program from the viewpoint of the men who flew in it should read, in addition to this book,  Andrew Chaikin's masterpiece &quot;A Man on the Moon&quot; and can skip the other astronaut autobiographies.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This cd was awesome.  It was a perfect blend of spanish and english. For those learning either spanish or english you have a couple of songs in both language to compare notes.  Plus there are a few in solely in english or spanish.  It was smart of shakira or her managers to set up this cd like this.  It has a bunch of english songs so people are willing to buy it since they can understand what she is saying but then it also arouses curiosity about the spanish language.  I heard about shakira in school and then more about her in my spanish class.  I tried her out and i was hooked.  Her songs are inspired and she is a great writer and i hope the best for her.
B00005O5CM|4.0|When my wife forced me to watch this movie, I originally thought that this was going to be a \\"chick flick\\" that I would have to sit through.  I was sure that it was going to be a one-joke movie.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br />This movie was smart in delivery.  There is no doubt that Reese Witherspoon carried this movie, and I doubt that anyone else could have.  She was able to portray her \\"ditzy blonde\\" character as someone with true intelligence and confidence.<br />While the very ending is a little lame, the entire movie is enjoyable and well worth watching.
B000002GA8|5.0|No matter what the critics through the years have said, Journey To The Centre Of The Earth has lasted. Sometimes when I listen to this I find it hard to believe that it's approaching 30 years old! Of course Rick Wakeman has lasted too and this shows why. It contains all of the good things we expect from progressive rock: classical influence, grand themes and awesome instrumentation, in this case keyboards. I fully agree with other reviewers, Rick Wakeman is probably the only one who could have pulled this off. As reasonable as this CD is you should buy it and listen to it about 5 times. If you haven't fallen in love with it by then re-sell it. You won't though so make space on your music shelf! Not just classic rock, classic period.

Not Kid Rock, not Limp Bizkit, not Korn, etc.  Nu-metal is a joke compared to the classic, timeless songwriting of bands like The Scorps, Iron Maiden, Rush, Sabbath, Dio, Symphony X, Metallica, Dokken, Loudness, AC/DC, Queensryche, Fates Warning, etc.  The nu-metal clowns should take some pointers on how to really write and play quality music from some of the aforemetnioned bands.  Long live The Scorpions!  LAFS is a great release!
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie had a unique storyline, fascinating characters, and a pace that kept your interest until the end.  The thing that impressed me the most about Amelie was that nothing was wasted.  Nearly every fact or detail in the story has relevance and often comes back into play later in a surprising and amusing way.  This is one of my favorite movies and will probably be one of the few DVDs I own.

I have re-read it many times in my late teens and early twenties, but did not return to it again until last year, in Berlin, at the age of 36. Well, a lot has changed in my life since.  I guess in that sense, my own story is somewhat different than many reviewers here: Although I considered myself an Objectivist until my mid-20s, I fortunately took Rand at her word, and made up my own mind on issues Randist.  So, even when the revelations came out in the 1980s of what a maniacal and cult-like figure she was, I never felt the sense of betrayal so many others did.  Actually, I kind of felt sorry for her, and for the people she manipulated and duped.  Life is too short to give and demand blind worship and obedience to some celebrity.<br />Sum it up to say, if you're looking for \\"I read 'The Fountainhead' as a teenager, but now -- ouch, I can't believe what an awful piece of turgid nonsense this is,\\" look elsewhere, not here.  On the other hand, those people are welcome to their opinions.  Neither am I a dyed-in-the-wool Objectivist Randroid, who will tell you that \\"The Fountainhead\\" is the greatest novel ever written.  When I was 17, I fervently believe it was; I don't now.  People read more, they develop new tastes.  So, for me the greatest novel ever is Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness.\\"  But, that doesn't mean that I'm going to swing to the other extreme and deride it into the ash can.<br />I agree with many reviewers that \\"The Fountainhead\\" is adolescent.  But, it is not adolescent in the same sense that \\"Beavis and Butt-Head\\" or \\"American Pie\\" is.  \\"The Fountainhead\\" captures that confused yet clear-headed sense of anticipation, loneliness, grandeur and fear of failure that make up the contradictory state of our teenage years, rather much like J.D. Salinger's writing did for some, Daniel Clowes' \\"Ghost World\\" does today, and Hunter S. Thompson's \\"The Rum Diary\\" did for me later on.  It is rather revealing that manyreviewers recoil from their adolescent fervor for \\"The Fountainhead,\\" because adolescence is an awkward, confusing and often embarassing time.  It is fraught with heartbreak, social faux-pas and immaturity.  But I have never felt the need to disassociate from my adolescent self, and this is why I can reflect upon this book more objectively (no pun intended), yet still appreciate it for its strengths.<br />One of the hallmarks of this book's adolescent spirit is that it is a paean to individualism and never selling out.  Of course, reality gives us all a swift kick in the rear, but I stopped confusing \\"The Fountainhead\\" with reality around the same time I started having to shave daily. There is no sadder a scene than seeing Rand's acolytes and detractors waging life-or-death battle over this book and her philosophy.  It reminds me of all the rather more rabid history buffs reliving and refighting the American Civil War. Come on, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is fiction, Rand died 20 years ago, and no-one is scared any longer of Leonard Peikoff's excommunicating temper tantrums, so lighten up out there! <br />The old cliche goes 'No-one has yet written the great American novel.' Well, in the sense that it must encompass all things American, no. To me, if a novel catches the _essence_ of America, that qualifies it.  Sinclair Lewis' \\"Elmer Gantry,\\" Ernest Hemingway's \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" Stephen Crane's \\"The Red Badge of Courage,\\" Mario Puzo's \\"The Godfather,\\" all these qualify in my mind for that elusive title.  And so does Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\" captures the spirit of America. I loved it thoroughly. Her characters are larger than life, the message of being true to one's self, and not selling out, sorely needed today. Rand expertly contrasts the novel's hero, Howard Roark - an uncompromising architect - with the tragic Gail Wynand, a newspaper baron who, like Othello, is a flawed hero, and whose quest for power and domination leads him to almost destroy that which he loves most. Actually, I DID find Roark a bit wooden (but not as wooden as Gary Cooper's portrayal of him in the 1949 movie).  Really, Gail Wynand is the most believable main character in this book, because he's torn by dillemma.  His is a character of tragic dimensions, rather like Orson Welles' Charles Foster Kane (who, like Wynand, was also based on William Randolph Hearst).  When Wynand sells out Roark, it isn't a betrayal so much of Roark, but of Wynand's own soul, and this is why I cry for Wynand.  Because of his basic fatal flaw.  Wynand chose damnation over redemption, rather much like Michael Corleone did in \\"The Godfather Part II\\" when he ordered and watched his brother Fredo's execution.  I can't countenance THAT being labelled \\"two-dimensional\\" or \\"cardboard\\" at all.  It is the great tragedy of the story.  <br />Ellsworth Toohey is the story's Iago, a small, cunning manipulator who himself tries to use Wynand's greatness to destroy Roark. Because of Wynand's own fatal flaw, he refuses to acknowledge Toohey's ability to influence and control.<br />I especially love the book's Roaring '20s and Depression-Era feel. Rand may have painted her heroes in romantic, Nietzshean brushstrokes, but her characterisations of her villains and non-heroes is sardonic and small, and owe's much to the naturalistic novels of Sinclair Lewis and the newspaper columns and book reviews of H.L. Mencken.  Her desciption of Stanton, Mass. -- tight, manicured, exhibitionist lawns in front of crackerbox houses -- is right out of Lewis' \\"Main Street\\" or \\"Babbitt.\\"  <br />And, close your eyes - you'll see a Hell's Kitchen as painted by Edward Hopper and Roark's skyscrapers as photographed by Alfred Stieglitz.<br />\\"The Fountainhead\\" may not be the greatest novel ever written, but it IS great.
B00005JKGK|5.0|Summary: \\"The Joy Luck Club\\", based on the novel by Amy Tan, is the story of four Chinese mothers and their American daughters. In particular, it is the story of their struggles for independence and self-discovery, told in lushly filmed vignettes that bind together the transcendent theme that self-esteem doesn't come cheaply.<br />---<br />A feather. The feather of a swan. A feather that carries with it all the hopes and dreams of a Chinese woman who left everything behind as she fled to America. Her hopes and dreams of a daughter who would be born in America, speak \\"perfect American English\\", and implicitly, live happy and free of the horrors her mother had fled in China. So begins the \\"Joy Luck Club\\", a story of four such Chinese mothers, their struggles for self-discovery in China, and their daughters' equally powerful struggles in America. There are eight stories here, but one overarching theme unifies, reinforces, and amplifies the lesson of self-esteem and it's survival value.<br />Lindo (Tsai Chin) was sold as a young girl in China. The sale was cemented when she was four or so. She was delivered at age fifteen, to a pre-pubescent husband who likes to play with lizards and a mother-in-law who sees her as nothing more than a grandson factory. Her brilliant escape from this nightmare grips with the same force as her daughter Waverly's escape from a different sort of prison.<br />An Mei (Lisa Lu) was the daughter of a lowly Fourth Wife, a mere concubine in a patriarchal home. Dealing with her mother's death, and learning the importance of knowing one's worth, sets the stage for her daughter Rose's story. Played brilliantly by Rosalind Chao, Rose finds her voice, and discovers her worth, when coming to grips with a marriage gone sour.<br />Ying-Ying (France Nuyen) wasn't sold. She wasn't born into a hopeless situation. Hers is a story of self-betrayal, and its price. A self-betrayal so horrifying that it left her soul fractured, sometimes paralyzing her into a catatonic state, unconscious of everything in the world except for one unspeakable regret. In her daughter Lina she sees the same weakness of spirit, the same tragic humility, and, most gratifyingly, a way to recapture what she had previously surrendered. In the defining scene of their story, she tells Lina: \\"Do you know what you want, I mean from him? Then tell him now. Do not come back until he gives you those things. Losing him does not matter. It is you who will be found.\\" In nurturing her daughter's self-affirmation, she makes huge strides in healing herself.<br />The feather is Suyuan's (Kieu Chinh). In her escape from China, she carries nothing but her dreams, and the memory of what she left behind in China. It is that story that closes the film, as her daughter June returns to China to discover her mother's past and to find her own fulfillment of her mother's hopes.

B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie upped my respect for Mr. Columbus, and the the DVD helped me accept these overpriced home-movie systems. To take a story to a more easily accesable media and simply repeat it would negate the purpose of the origonal, so those who disliked it simply because it didn't hug the plot of the book close enough, just think about it from another angle for a sec'. Anyway, the movie is beautifully crafted and a boon to the entire industry. If you by chance have not seen it YET you ought to. It realy is worth a handfull of hours. As for the DVD itself, the cut sceens are enchanting and watching it with the spanish dubbing is amusing and probably a little educational. Back to general movie info, I have to comment on the music. It hearkens back to Mr. Columbus's earlier work &quot;Hook&quot; and did nothing but enhance the other-worldly setting. The casting was dead-on, matching my personal mind's-eye picture perfectly, barring none. I, along with my fellow Harry Potter enthusiests, eagerly await the continued release of movies and books. To Miss Rowling, the companion books are approprietly wonderfull and I have duely bought my coppy of &quot;Quiddage Through the Ages&quot; and the others. Harry Potter isn't just for kids. It's charm speaks to anyone willing to listen. O, and the chess game sceen is &quot;bloody brilliant&quot;.
B00005JKG7|5.0|John Carpenter is the current master of the cheesy horror flick.  This film is great -- a creepy lighthouse, a pirate's treasure, ghostly undead, and -- of course -- the fog.  Some of Carpenter's \\"repeat offender\\" actors are in the film, including Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Hal Holbrook.  The dialog is a bit contrived at times, and the ghostly pirates move a bit too slow, but it's all in good fun and builds up the suspense.  Naturally, the sound effects are classic Carpenter and add to the ambience, if that's the right word to use.  You can't go wrong with this film if you like good old-fashioned scary stories or if you just like Carpenter.

B00005JLDW|4.0|A film that probably isn't worth watching with all those other movies still on the screens! Matthew McConaughey presents a reasonably impressive effort. But he was better in U571. It's a confusing modern day Medieval drama-if that makes sense. It's too much of a fantasy! It's like reading an encyclopedia of a sci-fi version of old legends. Then why did I even give it 4 stars? Hey-I like the dragons. The best thing in the movie were the dragons. The impressive special effects used in creating the dragons-bold fire breathing creatures were great! Still it's nothing like Lord of the Rings!         It's set in present day London where a mum wakes up a dragon-hidden for centuries. It's up to the son to save a small community still alive twenty years later!       Still the movie wasn't all that bad with the dragons entertaining the audience. It's a goofy flick but still sort of interesting. Think of it as a fantasy and you'd like it. It's not that original-it's a mixture of a lot of fantasy flicks I've seen (namely Armageddon, Godzilla, and Dungeons &dragons). It isn't a movie that'll be named a classic years from now but it's still enjoyable. I wouldn't mind riding a rollercoaster produced after the movie. The movie can be described as a thrilling-horror theme park ride. So overall the film isn't all that bad-but it could've been a lot better!
037571412X|1.0|I have a credential to crab about this book.  As does the main character in this book, I teach at a major university and a think tank, have published a few books, appear on television a fair amount,  am a mere decade younger than Roth's \\"protagonist\\" (or do I mean misogynist), and am quite aware of mid-20's femmes. I must to say this is the most unrealistic, stupid book written about these  relationships, largely because, in Roth's book,  they aren't relationships at all. Further, this book seems so scarily autobiographical (or did I mean to say autoerotic) that I am almost ashamed to be the same sex as the writer.<br />At least in \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\" he beat off a lot.  That doesn't harm anyone and may even make one's wrists stronger.  But here, he is so fixated on sex, weird sex, and weirder sex that he becomes  incapable of understanding at all that people may actually (gasp) fall in love and stay together for a long time, and that this is pretty important. In fact, he's contemptuous of it when he sees it in his own son. And, dear ladies out there, he views all this as the triumph of the rise of feminism.<br />I bought this book because the subject of relationships with a substantial age difference is an interesting and provoking one to any 50-ish guy...and one I believe is best viewed through the prism of evolutionary biology and modern medicine, where we now confront the fact that women live long past reproductive maturity while men die essentially still capable.  The fact that for millions of years most women died before then (check the Boston graveyards if you don't believe this) is evidence for serial monogamy, which opens up a remarkable unfairness to women that has developed as an unintended consequece of modern technology.<br />I was hoping Roth had some insight on this, but he was too busy looking at his pud, which, in this case is the way he treats women.<br />Oy Vey! Wann der Putz Shtet!!
0375703764|4.0|This is one mother of a book.  While it gets slightly tedious in the middle it is strange enough to keep you reading.  The insane text and added story/footnotes made it even better.  Also, this is one of the first fictional horror novels that confinced me of its veracity for a time.
6303823351|4.0|Released only a year after the critically acclaimed \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" this film has a subtle edge to it, which in hindsight is quite poignant.<br />Yes, the boys are gorgeous, so young, so talented, so sexy--and in COLOR this time. The music, as it always was with the Beatles, was innovative for its time, often brilliant. The very silly plot, in which some bad guys want to steal a sacred ring from Ringo's finger, is fun and ridiculous and infectious. But it only takes a close listen to John Lennon's title song, \\"Help,\\" to know that he was already in distress.<br />The demands on the Fab Four were getting more and more troubling to each of them. Just on the horizon, if not already begun, was time with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, heavy use of LSD, the John and Yoko saga, Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heartclub Band, and all that was to come until the inevitable acrimonious disintegration of the group.<br />Viewed in hindsight, therefore, \\"Help\\" makes this reviewer sad. It is so seemingly happy and innocent, so \\"60s,\\" and yet the viewer knows that it all fell apart. I think for those who did not experience the Beatles firsthand, however, this movie has to be a thoroughly enjoyable and wonderful experience. And for the rest of us, it's a trip down memory lane to a time when all things still seemed possible.

6303567126|5.0|It is ironic that some of the best films out there are low-budget - Full Monty, Snatch, The Way Of The Gun, Romper Stomper. If not cheap then certainly far from overly expensive. The reason for the success of these films is that they are genuinely good. After you got past the effects, was Titanic, Gladiator, Pearl Harbour, AI or Independance Day really that good? In fact, Pearl Harbour has many people's votes (although not mine since I'll admit I haven't seen it myself) as one of the worst films ever made.<br />Basketball Diaries is a gritty and low-budget film. This doesn't shy away behind special effects or fancy graphics. What you see is what you get. The story is a harrowing tale of drug abuse, which starts with low-class drugs like glue...and works it's way up to heroin. I think it is actually a true story, which makes it all the more chilling. When it starts it reminds you of yourself growing up - the first time you may have experimented, had sex or did something dangerous; how you behave with your mates. But it becomes detatched, showing you the harsh reality of what can happen when relatively harmless drug dabbling turns into a daily addiction.<br />All in all, Basketball Diaries is brilliantly executed film. It certainly shows DiCaprio's greatest performance that I've seen by a mile. If you want happy endings and sugar coated fun look elsewhere.

B000002JKA|4.0|With the heavy punch of 6:00, Caught In A Web and Lie, the progressiveness of Scarred and the melancholia of Lifting Shadows Off A Dream and Space Dye Vest, Awake showcases a heavier and/or darker Dream Theater than on Images And Words before it and Scenes From A Memory after it. If it wasn't Petrucci's soloing and that the song is almost 7 minutes long Lie could very well be a Soundgarden number.<br />I do admit I miss Kevin Moore and John Petrucci's dueling like they did on Metropolis Part 1 from Images And Words. Kevin seems to take a real back seat on this album, further saddened by the fact that this is his last with the band and when he does play he's often fantastic. John is on great form here (although I've never heard him on anything less) and his solos are just brilliant. I especially love his neo-calssical sounding solo on Erotomania and his wild spiralling first solo on Lie. Mike's performance on drums here is also great and LaBrie... although I can sort of see why some may find his voice irritating on this album I just think its fantastic. He has a superb range, sings with a great deal of passion and power and the tone of voice is very edgy and heavy.<br />My favourite songs: - I really like Caught In A Web. A huge vocal performance by LaBrie makes this perhaps the best track on the album for me (at least one of them). The heaviness of Lie with some brilliant soloing a la Petrucci is another favourite. Erotomania is also a great instrumental. It's more melodic and not as heavy as Lie. I also like the opener 6:00 and the quiet and moody Lifting Shadows Off A Dream.<br />However, for every action there is usually an equal and opposite reaction. There are three songs in particular that I was unimpressed with. Voices is alright, but a 10-minute drag-out is not progressive - to be progressive the song has to progress. Simply being long does not make it either good or progressive. Voices could have been much better if it was 3 or even 4 minutes shorter than it was. Being long for the sake of it is not good since there is simply not enough to the song to keep your attention for 10 minutes. I was also unimpressed with Silent Man, a potentially sad but beautiful guitar and vocal piece that failed to impress me and The Mirror, a potential rocker that in my opinion lacks energy and seems a little flat. I feel the band could have done a bit more with some of the material here especially because I know they did beforehand - it sounds like it was released before Images And Words rather than after. Images and Words felt far more professional. I don't usually listen to this all the way through, but skip from song to song when I feel like it.<br />Nonetheless this is a good album, and although Images and Words is clearly superior, it doesn't contain either the heaviness or the dark edge that Awake has. It may be too thoughtful for the average metalhead or too heavy for the average proghead. It isn't the band's best by any means and I don't recommend it to those who are yet to discover Dream Theater. Nonetheless, it is a good album with some great songs on it.it was.

0441172717|5.0|Dune is, without a doubt, the best Sci Fi book ever written, if not the best BOOK ever written. Every page I finished pulled me into the next one. It is an inspiring and well-done story that should keep any reader captivated until the last page. The Dune series easily dominates the Lord of the Rings and other critically acclaimed Science Fiction novels. I just can't understand why some people found it to be a bad book. Over and over, their reason for not liking it is: Boring. If anyone thinks this is boring, they must have the attention span of a 5 year old with ADD. Buy Dune now.

Coraline is a wonderful young role model who draws upon inner strengths and cooperates with friends to reach her goals.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I liked the movie version of this wonderful book for the reason that it was Harry Potter, plain and simple.  I could not bring myself to give it less than four stars; still, I could not give it five, either.  The book was, of course, better than the movie.  What can you expect?  That's the way it always goes down.  <BR>I'll get my picky details out of the way.  If you didn't read the books, you don't care about these.  First, it was a slight irritation to me that Harry's hair was in no way messy.  That was actually a pretty big part of the book and his character.  Second, the whole movie's mood and tone were different that the book's.  The book was more matter-of-fact - everything about Hogwarts was just like an average English boarding school - except magic was bursting from every wall.  The wizard-born students treated it like it was normal.  But in he movie, every quirk (the moving pictures or owl post, for example) was accompanied by a mysterious, twinkling background music.  I did like it, but I had to completely separate the movie from the book - almost as if they were completely different stories.<BR>The special effects were interesting.  Most of all, however, I loved the spirited performances by Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and Daniel Radcliffe.  I loved Rupert Grint as Ron.  He was my favorite character.  The way he conveyed Ron's half-awkward, half-arrogant presence and delivered those lines that Ron didn't mean to be funny, but were anyway.  <BR>I hoped this review helped you decide whether the movie's worth seeing, whether or not you've read the books.
0380977788|5.0|I had the honor of hearing Neil describe the book \\"Coraline\\" in person at a book signing for \\"American Gods\\" last year in NYC and just his description of 'the other parents' gave me not only a shiver up my spine but a smile of anticipation as well.  After what seemed like ages (but what was in reality a mere year) I held the book \\"Coraline\\" at long last in my hands.  I devoured it in two days (which says something since those two days were somewhat on the particularly busy side).<br />From page one, paragraph one, word one Neil Gaiman had me under his spell.  When at work, I had a near constant smile on my face because I knew what I was reading was not just another book.  The sheer masterful talent (dare I say 'genius'?  Oh well, it came out and I will leave it there -- sorry Neil!!) behind it just put me in such a pleasant mood plus I new when my shift was over I would be returning home to allow Neil to wrap me up within the shadowy world he had created.<br />Let me talk a little about the main character Coraline.  I think she is an incredible role-model for young girls -- she is brave, intelligent, quick-witted, kind, and one of the best female heroine's I have ever seen in either written form or film.  She is the daughter that I would love to have.<br />To compare \\"Coraline\\" to \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" or \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" would not do the book justice as it is far darker than either one ever was.  It stands alone, not only as a remarkable achievement in children's literature but in literature itself.  Not only is this one of the best pieces I have read from Neil Gaiman, it's one of the best books I ever read -- and I have read a lot throughout the years (not that I'm old yet -- 30 years have not yet passed me by!).<br />I have heard it said that Neil Gaiman has written this book for \\"strange girls of all ages\\".  While I am not a girl, I do suppose I could be considered 'strange' to some, but I am one who loves to read a fantastic tale with a strong femalelead and captivating narrative style.<br />Anyone who meets those requirements or just loves an incredibly well-written book, needs to own this.

While a relatively short novel, the intricately woven plot offers all the right details at different points.  And at the end of the book, the characters all seem to make sense, with all of the given clues fitting very well.  <BR>     This story of the nice, mellow Dr. Jekyll and his hidden mad-man persona, Mr. Hyde, is a classic clash of good and evil.  The author does a wonderful job of keeping the reader wondering about each one's true identity. From Hyde's first trampling, to his murder, to the bitter end, he is portrayed as the exact opposite of Dr. Jekyll, despite an odd, hidden relationship. Only at the very end is the mystery compltely solved.<BR>      What makes the novel most unique is the inclusion of numerous other developed characters besides Jekyll and Hyde, such as Utterson, Lanyon, and Enfield.  All in all, this is a timeless tale, a true stoy of inner conflict.  What this novel lacks in length, it makes up for in well-developed characters, and a superb plot.  A must-read.
B000067CPX|5.0|I bought this CD on Tuesday along with Counting Crows 'Hard Candy'. I haven't listened to the CC yet since I haven't been able to stop listening to 'By the Way'. It is an incredible CD and shows the maturity of the band. This is to Californication as The Godfather Pt II was to the Godfather. If you only know the Peppers from the sock-hanging mystic and have written them off...don't. John Fruisciante is an amazing guitarist (Check out the solo on 'Throw Away Your Television'). Highlights...'Universally Speaking', 'The Zephyr Song', 'Tear' and 'Venice Queen'.
B00005RYLE|5.0|yes this is an instant classic. This DVD does the movie justice you get great picture quailty, Great extras and the handsom looking DVD case which is The Book of Dead. One of Bruce Cambell's best performances. This movie had two sequals made right after it bith very funny. Check out all 3
B000003TA4|3.0|People...please go buy a copy of EXTREME'S 3 SIDES TO EVERY STORY<BR>(a band that Kurt Cobain threw shots at...)and then listen to this album and tell us how you feel! I am so sick of hearing about this album and band...AND how Nirvana killed off all the bad music. There really is nothing that special about this album and to put it up there as one of the best albums of all time with groups like the Stones and Beatles is just absolutely ludicrus. It's funny how alot of the bands that Nirvana \\"killed off\\" are actually still around. I guess good music never goes away! With all that said, this album is not complete garbage...it is good for what it is, especially Dave Grohl's drumming but the album In Utero is a better album...AND like another reveiwer pointed out, the success of this album just shows the mentality of the music industry, mtv, rolling stone magazine, spin magazine, etc...OH and the fickle force fed american music buying public...but that will never change! On final thought, I am not sure why Kurt Cobain threw shots at Extreme either, was he jealous that they could actually write good songs. In fact, there were many great bands out before Nirvana reared their ugly head but again people just don't listen! Oh well, everybody has their opinion...even Kurt Cobain!!!
044022165X|4.0|There are some great reviews up top so I wont bother to repeat what others have said. This book was great with a lot of humor. <br />The only thing it lacked was a good ending. I found the ending terrible. I dont want to explain why because I would give the whole book away. <br />Conclusion: Rip out the last 20 pages. Grisham should have ended the book in the middle of Chapter 51.<br />DAN

0446343129|5.0|If Americans would read this book and take it seriously, that would be the end of our modern food processing industry as we know it, especially the cereal industry.  It would also quite possibly end our epidemic of diabetes and other debilitating diseases, IMHO.<br />The only reason our food processors use sugar as their main &quot;filler&quot; ingredient is because they can't get away with using saw dust or horse dung (not yet, anyway).  The FDA has been AWOL on this for a long time, proving we have the best Congressmen that money can buy.  They are supposed to oversee these agencies, but were long ago bought off by the lobbies.<br />My grandmother gave me some very good advice one time.  When you go into a supermarket to shop, stick to the walls.  You'll stay far healthier that way. &quot;Sugar Blues&quot; explains why.
B000066NW0|5.0|&quot;Let Go&quot; is the best cd I've bought in the past year.  &quot;Complicated&quot; is a great song along with &quot;Losing Grip&quot;( i thought Avril sounded a bit like Dido in this track), &quot;My World&quot; , &quot;Unwanted&quot;( anger in this track), &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; ( a cute song :)), &quot;I'm With You&quot;, and &quot;Naked&quot; ( absolutly beautiful).<br />&quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; is my favorite song because it has such a great beat and its a different song than you hear everyday.  Its a great show of a girl punk.  If your looking for a great cd to add to your collection, this is it.
0780622553|4.0|How could you imagine you are living a world controlled by unknown. Think of a day you suddendly realize that. What can you do to face the reality, escape or fight till the end. You can start your thinking after watching the movie.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Although many would criticise John Mayer's sound as being simple, that is what makes it so wonderful. The simplicity of the music and the honesty are what allow you to just lay back and absorb the warmth of his voice as the lyrics flow with the acoustics. No thinking required, just blunt, straight forward lyrics to relax with after a hectic day.
0452282152|2.0|The book has a simple structure and there is nothing new or exciting in the story.  This is the kind of book you should read on a plane ride but don't expect anything deep, meaningful or original.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Many people criticise John Mayer's music as being simple, but that is what makes it so great. The simplicity and honesty of the words and his warm voice make this a great cd to buy. No thinking required, just blunt, straightforward lyrics to relax with after a hectic day.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|I shall first make it clear that it is not my intention to bash this movie or discourage those from seeing it (if you happen to be the poor soul who has not taken the initiative to see it).  In truth, the movie is based on an amazing story of human triumph over illness and the remarkable feats and capabilities of the human mind, in this case the mind of mathematician John Nash.  This is also a great movie, quite deserving of its Best Picture status as a result of the story and the acting by Crowe and Connelly.  Both were brilliant, especially Crowe.  How he did not win Best Actor, and losing to a bad boy cop, simply blows my mind.  Even worse a disgrace to the supposed gullibility of humankind is the awarding of Best Director to Ron Howard.  Granted, this is a very good movie, but this is solely because of an incredible script and incredible acting all around.  What makes this movie NOT a great one is the near botch job by director Ron Howard.  He nearly blew this movie, which was an impossible one to screw up, analogous to a free lunch.  The movie ran choppily and deemphasized the audience's understanding of what Nash's work, and thus his mind, was all about.  Howard could have directed this movie more smoothly, invested a tiny amount of extra energy to better describe Nash's mathematical acheivements, and also added a couple of scenes during the initial stages of the love story in order to strenghthen our perception of their love.  However, he perhaps divulged too many scenes towards throwing us for a loop via a plot twist regarding his actual mental illness versus what his view of reality was.  Regardless of the sloppy efforts of Ron Howard coupled with the tragic blunder committed by the Oscar Committee, one should see this movie, if not for watching a movie that attempts to desribe Nash's beautiful mind and even more beautiful, his strength and courage, but at the very least to watch acting at its finest.  Acting so good,  that it (Crowe/Connelly) saves a moviefrom the perilous fallibility of Howard, and yet not be fully rewarded by the Oscar committee while the undeserving benefactor is instead exalted to add insult to injury.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I had never been into Spider-Man or any other comic book hero before and was a little skeptical when a friend suggested I see it.  Star Wars was my big thing and I saw it first.  Spider-Man almost seemed puny at first.  At first.  I have now seen it 3 times and it gets better every time!  The special effects are so real and the story line is comfortable for all ages.  Romance, action and Tobey Maguire!  Who could ask for more?  I now like Marvel Comics and other related items as well and it's ok for those who aren't into it either.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Romantics will love this movie, most other people will think it was a so-so film. The movie is told in three parts. It begins with John Nash a young math student in college. It documents his social life and math research. The next part is when his illness takes root and his life is thrown into chaos. The third is his realization and prevail over his illness. The start is kinda slow for some, but towards the middle it picks up nicely. And the end is touching. The acting in this film is superb. And the make up is just right. Its also very nice to see some math in a commercial film. Overall I had no big problems, and would recommend this film to anyone who is a romantic, interested in biography or mathematics and mental illness. 5 stars. Check it out.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This album is timeless. It is rare to see an ARTIST (as opposed to a singer) put so much thought and passion into the lyrics of each and every song.  Lauryn Hill should educate Britney Spears and Alicia Keys as to how to make true artwork.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is a very fun film, that mends action with philosophical concepts and religious symbolism. The film is fun to watch just because it has some very cool action scenes that are pleasurable for the eyes. Yet there exists a more intellectual depth for your mind. What makes it great is that, upon viewing it multiple times, you get more out of it. You discover different themes and messages, every person gets something different out of it. There are many interpretations and views you can arrive at. <br />The characters are great, the best being Morpheus and Agent Smith. The character of Neo as a doubting Thomas-Christ figure is played out well. And it is very pleasing to see a female action star that is not put on the screen just to showcase sexuality, but who is tough and can take care of herself.<br />Watch for the \\"Night of the Lepus\\" clip, and BULLET TIME special effects (that every new movie copies). 5 Stars. Check it out.
B000068QY7|3.0|You know, i was psyched when i got this, and maybe i'll come around in a year or two after i've listened to it a million times, but this album seems a step down.  <br />There are some nice tracks on here - hindu times, little by little come to mind - but it sounds more like a collection of b-sides and odds and ends.  i thought \\"Standing On...\\" was a pretty decent album, definitely back on track at least, but this is not the return to glory i was expecting (and no, i'm not pining for another version of wonderwall...).  Believe me, i'll be one of the first to pat the Gallagher brothers & co. on the back - esp. Noel b/c he's a genius and probably pulls most of the weight in the band - but i have to be honest and say that this album was less than i expected given their last effort.  (and maybe that's a compliment, if you consider their last among their best)  <br />Still, not a bad album and obviously worth it if you like Oasis
B000066NW0|5.0|I bought Avril Lavigne's debut CD about a week after it came out, and I ended up being mad at myself that I hadn't bought it sooner. I fell in love with the songs immediately, because they are great, and I connected to them on a very deep level.  I am 15 years old and my whole life I have had the \\"preppy\\" image, with my good grades, my preppy friends and my preppy clothes. I have never liked it, I don't like being referred to as a \\"prep,\\" so recently I started dressing my way, or as everyone else sees it, in a punk-rocker way, kind of like Avril, but without the tie.  I have never until recently even thought of dressing like I want to, and acting like I want to because I have always been scared of what people's reaction to me would be. I know, to some it may be stupid that I care so much, but I don't want to be judged on what I wear. I want to be judged on who I am, and how I conduct myself. Avril Lavigne's debut CD \\"Let Go\\" actually helped me in a way, tracks like  \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" and \\"Nobody's Fool\\" helped me, because I am Nobody's Fool, and \\"sometimes I get so weird I even freak myself out,\\" just ask my friends and you'll see how true that is. LOL.  And tracks like \\"Too much to ask,\\" Tomorrow,\\" and \\"I'm With You,\\" more or less explain situations that I have found myself in and/or I am going through right now.  Avril is exactly what we needed, what I needed at least, she's not another Britney, and that is SO GREAT, cuz that's the last thing we ever need. Avril is Not Pop Princess, no, not at all; she's the Friggin QUEEN OF PUNK ROCK. She's great, and I thank her for writing her songs, for writing them from the heart, and for being herself. So, Thanks Avril! U ROCK!!! U R ANYTHING BUT ORDINARY, and that's a very good thing.  So GO, buy this CD, cuz who knows, it might end up helping u like it helped me.
B000067CPX|4.0|This album was not what I expected, but the music is great.  The band has definately made a more mystic and intense style of music with this one.  The depth and imagination to the guitar, bass and drums is truly awesome, and there is lot's of emotion and substance to the lyrics.  I can't stop playing &quot;don't forget me&quot; to hear John Frusciante's guitar work.  Overall, I'd recommend this album for getting in to some great music, but less so for &quot;rocking out&quot;.
B000002UB6|5.0|After years of studio experimentation, The Beatles decided to return to their roots, and the Get Back (later to be retitled Let It Be) project was born. Yet the band was dissatisfied with the results, and the tapes were left to gather dust while Abbey Road was recorded. Then, several months later John Lennon had Phil Spector remix the tapes, and Let It Be was released on May 8, 1970. Even with Spector's heavy-handed production, Let It Be remains a solid album and maintains a feeling of rawness that sets it apart from the other later-period Beatles albums. Song for song, Let It Be is definitley not The Beatles best, but featues some great stuff. Harrison is at his best on the guitar here. His majestic solo during the title track takes the song to even greater heights, and even on the worst numbers (I Me Mine, Dig a Pony) his playing still shines. Lennon doesn't disappoint on guitar either, with marvelous slide guitar on the delightful For You Blue and excellent lead work on the classic rocker Get Back. Also, The Long and Winding Road is one of McCartney's finest ballads, and Across the Universe is a beautiful Lennon number, both are real gems. Dig It and Maggie Mae are simply filler that I don't even consider to be songs,  and they bring the album down a bit. But they are easily made up for by the good stuff. Now, I mentioned above that Dig a Pony and I Me Mine are the worst songs here. Neither are bad songs at all, just the weakest here in my opinion. ( I have a tendency to do this when I call any Beatles song the worst on an album). <BR> <BR>Don't be influenced by the negative reviews. Let It Be is a very good album and doesn't at all deserve the bad reputation it gets.
B00006690G|4.0|When I heard the Eminem Show for the first time I knew that he's back.All of the tracks are hot 1-20. Each of the songs has meaning that what makes him one of the best rappers out there.If you haven't brought the cd yet you should because it is probably the best cd out there.
0064407667|5.0|Lemony Snicket (don't you just love that name?) has some bad news for us. Mind you, the reader can tell he loves telling it, and enjoys spreading the bad news. This is one reader that Snicket has hooked.<br />Meet the Baudelaire orphans (Violet, Klaus and Sunny) they are the children who have a bad beginning. They find out that their parents have died, and then are forced to live with their strange, scary, and greedy Count that wants all of their money. When the children are with him, they have to do all sorts of work, and sleep in terrible conditions. Hence, it's a bad beginning....and it doesn't get much better. The Count wants to steal all their money. I won't say anything more about the plot, because I dont' want to ruin it.<br />Snicket has a wonderful sence of humor. It comes through in his unique style of writing that keeps the reader glued to the page. The characters are ones that the reader cares about and wants to know more about them.<br /> All of the kids in the class I student taught in begged me to read it. I was glad I did. this is a wonderful read. When the kids complained abbout something, I said that they should be glad that they aren't the  Baudelaire orphans.<br />If you start this series, you won't be sorry.
B000002LK1|5.0|When I think of '80s music, I immediately conjure up new wave or synth/pop, Depeche Mode in particular. Their dark yet melodic brand of dance music was a tell-tale sign of what was to come in the genre of techno music. Dave Gahan's deep, rich, monotonus vocals lends a warmth to the cold, electronic beats. Martin Gore proved himself to be one of my personal favorite songwriters from that era as well as remains one of my favorites today. Of all the albums that Depeche Mode has released over the years, \\"Violator\\" stands out as the band's most definitive album for me. \\"Violator\\" also introduced the world to some of the band's biggest hits (and my favorite DM songs). For me \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" and \\"Personal Jesus\\" are my two ultimate Depeche Mode songs. As far as ballads goes, \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" remains my personal favorite. The haunting melodies and lyrics still takes my breath away to this very day. Dave Gahan couldn't sound any [better] than he does on this song. \\"Personal Jesus\\" is my favorite upbeat track by the band. That opening riff still blows me away to this very day. I just adore that twanginess of the synthesizer. It is too infectious and addictive. Both songs still sounds fresh in the sea of [bad music] that is being played [too much] on the radio. In 10 years, who is going to remember Papa Roach and Limp Bizkit like Depeche Mode whose music from the '80s is still remembered and being played in the nightclubs and on the radio? Of course I adore the haunting melodies of \\"Policy of Truth\\". Another personal favorite DM ballad of mine. All the songs on \\"Violator\\" are classics, especially the non-single tracks like \\"Sweetest Perfection\\" and \\"World In My Eyes\\". If there is one Depeche Mode album to own, I would have to say that \\"Violator\\" is that album. Although the production is weak and the album is in dire need of a remastering job soon, songwise, this album is a classic. My ultimate album.
0064407667|1.0|This book was horrible. Boring, slow, the characters were 2 dementional, the villin was not the kind you love to hate but as stupid and as meaningless as all the rest of the characters. The Characters were sappy and clingy and didn't quite cach on. The plot was dull and the words in between were meaningless. Honestly I don't know how this book caught on. This book was so horrible it could become on of those \\"great novels!\\" the your teacher makes you read! If i could give this novel a half of star i would. Don't waste your money. As you can probably tell, i don't take reading a bad novel very well-espeally when so many people rave about it. Read J k rowling instead.
B00003XB8K|5.0|I think of all the four albums of original music that Enigma has put out, &quot;The Screen Behind the Mirror&quot; is by far the best album.  It was pretty evident on the previous album that Enigma has stepped further away from the Gregorian chants which has now become all too popular in ambient/new age music. Here Michael Cretu furthers his experimentation with beats that are more trip hop and less new age. On &quot;The Screen Behind the Mirror&quot;, Sandra Cretu chooses to limit her role as vocalist and for lead vocalist on the songs is Olive's Ruth-Ann who was in my book, the ideal vocalist. Her smooth, silky vocals were a right match with the electronic, ambient beats that Michael Cretu composed. On &quot;The Screen Behind the Mirror&quot;, the music (well, most of it anyways) centers around a sample of Carl Orff's &quot;Carmina Burana (O Fortuna)&quot; which I thought was just great, although nothing original. Obviously the stand out track on this album has to be &quot;Gravity of Love&quot; with the stunning vocals by Ruth-Ann and the bombastic notes of &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;. I found it extremely soothing to listen to &quot;Smell of Desire&quot; with its haunting melodies. &quot;Modern Crusaders&quot; is one of the best examples on this album that uses the Carl Orff track with the bombastic yet grandeur melodies. &quot;Traces (Light and Weight)&quot; almost sounds like it was composed underwater with those bleeps that the listener hears throughout the song. As much as I love Enigma's first two albums, I do think their more recent albums are by far the best out of the four, and especially &quot;The Screen Behind the Mirror&quot;. You can hear the constant evolving in Michael Cretu's work.
0380820846|5.0|The fourth installment in the Bridgerton series meets the high expectations set by the previous books.  What seems to be a recurring topic in this genre again prevails - the girl is in love with prince charming who in turn is in love with the girl, but has not realized it yet.<BR>Two things make this book(and the series) worth reading: the dialogue and the plot.  Quinn succeeds in developing a banter between the main characters that is intelligent and funny.  The other characters in the novel are also pretty well developed, setting the tone for the upcoming books in the series.  She is wonderful at creating a story line, that although predictable, wraps the reader up from beginning to end.<BR>I highly recommend this book to all romance fans, you will not be disappointed!

0060987464|5.0|This book is everything a Marilyn Manson fan would expect: it's creative, painfully honest, and intelligent--just like his music. The book contains everything from his unpleasant childhood reflections to his final awakening along with various incidents throughout his life that molded him into the knowingly uncanonical person he is. He tells his own story without constantly trying to look like the good guy. I especially enjoyed the chapter on his induction into Satanism where he describes its meaning, at least what it means to him, and it added to the respect I already had for him.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has a desire to understand Marilyn Manson's perspective or to anyone who wants to discover where a few of the outrageous rumors pertaining to him actually came from.
0743420373|1.0|I was given this book as a gift and was thoroughly disappointed.  This book simply states that you should live below your means, stay out of debt and save money, if you want to be a millionaire.  Shocking!  The statistical data shows that most millionaires don't live in fancy houses, drive fancy cars, belong to country clubs or eat out a lot.  True.  Most millionaires are people nearing retirement with large 401(k)s/pensions and houses that have appreciated significantly in value.  In order to take advantage of this savings, they'll need to sell their homes and begin to liquidate their 401(k)s.  In other words, they will be living off this money as retirees.  They will not be dining on caviar and champagne every night nor living on a $500,000 yacht.  They will need every dime in this high priced world.  In other words, they will not be rich . . . and let's face it, people are buying this book because they want to know how to \\"get rich\\" not how to have a safe retirement.  I suppose a better title for this book should have been: \\"A safe retirement is within reach for someone with fiscal discipline\\".  Boring and obvious advice.
B000067CPX|3.0|\\"By the Way\\" is the Red Hot Chili Peppers's newest album. It is softer and more timid than their previous albums such as \\"Mother's Milk\\", or \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\". Even though the Chili Peppers aren't quite what they used to be as a musical group, they are still the same characters personally. Where the instrumental penomenon of talent has gone is a mystery, but the album is still good. Some of the melodies do get a little monotonous, but over all they are pleasing. However, I am very displeased with the duldrum beats, their drummer has massive talent but does not show it. If you are looking for a hard rocking group, pick up one of their previous albums; I would personally recommend \\"Mother's Milk\\" or \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\", but even \\"Californication\\" is a very good album. Overall, the alum is a toss up. It is good, but they have done much better.

Sure,it 'sounds' dated,but it's J-O-U-R-N-E-Y we're talkin' about here,kids! And these ARE brand new songs..AND they're GREAT songs! Major KUDOs for these guys carrying on in such fine fashion! Will this bring back memories of 'Infinity','Escape',etc? Absolutely!! Is that a bad thing? My vote....NOOOOOOO! Buy It Now!!
B000068QY7|4.0|Overall this is another above average Oasis album.  Nothing can compare to D.M. and W.T.S.(M.G.) thus every album will pale in comparison.  Oasis is not the type of band that re-invents their sound from album to album and for them, I think that is a good thing.  Like S.O.T.S.O.G. and B.H.N., most songs on this album are decent.  Little by Little is a classic Noel ditty and Hindu Times has all the elements of a standard Oasis stadium anthem.  Songbird and She Is Love are somewhat new roads taken by Oasis but let's face it, there will never be another time where you put on the radio and get the same feeling you experienced when you heard Rock &amp; Roll Star for the first time...and that, my friends, is the problem.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigen showed the world that freshman albums rock and so do skater boys, punk and ties.  Her first single track two on Let Go \\"Complicated\\" was anything but.  With strong lyrics and a perfict message for todays teens sufering from identiy crisis she did amazing.  The lyric's \\"Your not fooling any one when you become some body else round everyone else\\" deffinitly shows that Avril is going to go far with her music and stick around.  Other songs on her cd that really make an impact are tracks one (Loosing Grip with the lyrics \\"You werent there when I was scared\\") and track 12 which talks about a boy being lame because he chose weed over her. All of her songs either have an awesome message or there just plain fun like Skater Boy. Avril is going to be a roll model for all girls to look up to. I think everyone should get her cd because shes on fire.
B000067CPX|2.0|Basically a one trick pony.  Cliched & souless, lacking not only power but also gentleness & subtlety, my once-favorite band delve into a variety of styles that don't suite them, such as ska and a latin-flavored number that's probably the worst song on the record. John tinkers way too much here and his leads have become too far too minimalistic. It sounds like Anthony sings every song in the same key and Flea (the heart and soul of the band) and Chad are reduced to hired guns, sitting in the background and sheepishly commenting on the dominating guitars and layered vocals. <br />This is not Chili Pepper music.  I feel like they should've changed their name for this one.  Hell, the title track is a tease and doesn't even belong on the cd.  There's bright spots of course, nice dashes of color sprinkled here and there over the conventional melodies and overwrought harmonies.  But in a word this record is boring -an adjective I never in a million years would-a thought would apply to the boys.<br />'By The Way' will bring many new fans into the RHCP camp but it will also alienate many of us who've been there all along.  With their progressive move towards accesibility, their growing disregard for the classic Pepper funk, and the unbelievable promotion this album's received, it's starting to smell a lot like a sell out.  The only thing left for them to do is use \\"Give it Away\\" to sell trucks, perform at the Super Bowl with In Sync (Hey, they have some nice melodies!) and they will have completed their metamorphosis from punk-rock classics to \\"radio joe's in a biz called show.\\"
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is one of the hottest new stars this year.  Her album and first single, &quot;Complicated&quot;, are climbing the charts.  With her skater-punk and hard rock style, she is sure to be a hit for a long time.  From singing about old boyfriends to her childhood in Napanee, Ontario, Avril shows what it's like in her life.
B000067CPX|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers have always been famous for shocking people with their albums. There's no reason why they should stop it and they know it. First you hear similarities to 'Californication' but after the first listen you realize it's totally different. The songs on 'By The Way' were created by God and every musician nowadays would be proud of them. This album consists of 16 songs and each is a beautiful experience for itself.<br />The opener 'By The Way' is a good song to start the album with. It sums up a bit what the Peppers have done before and guides your ears into a new territory. The next highlight is 'This Is The Place', this one could be also on 'Californication' but it really shows how much Kiedis' vocals have improved since then. 'Don't Forget Me' could easily be on a Peppers' best of CD while 'The Zephyr Song' is one of the most obvious Frusciante songs here- with a drum machine in the background like in John's latest solo album.<br />'Can't Stop' is a welcomed change- like 'By The Way' it reflects the old days and creates place for something new, in this case John's backing vocals that are a brand mark for the whole album. The most curious song title is 'I Could Die For You' cause I never expected it from the Peppers- I wonder Anthony did the lyrics after the breakoff with his girlfriend. Everybody say 'Tear' is Beach Boys-style but I don't mind cause it's a good song. 'Lemon Trees On Mercury' has a nice melody and you can dance to it too. Another favorite of mine is 'Minor Thing' that sounds similar to 'My Lovely Man'. My only complaint is that I'd like to hear more ...[Flea]- someone already noticed he sounded deadly on the live gigs cause you could hear the bass loudly. I hope it's his and Chad's turn on the next album but we'll see. <br />I recommend 'By The Way' to ALL music fans, I think this record won't change the universe like Blood Sugar Sex Magik did but it will definately help us to keep it up.
B00005JKBC|3.0|\\"Spy Game\\" is a movie that has a wonderful back story about a cagey CIA veteran's recruitment and development of a top Marine sniper for undercover work and the evolution of the their friendship.  It gets bogged down by trying to slap a current day operation over the telling of the back story.  This story is expertly developed as it shows CIA vet, Nathan Muir's (Robert Redford), introduction to a brash, young Marine, Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) during Vietnam.  Muir recruits Bishop to go on a very risky sniper mission to take out a top Vietnamese general.  Bishop overcomes some tremendous obstacles (including an attack helicopter) and succeeds in his mission.  An impressed Muir makes a mental note that he thinks Bishop would make a good agent and slowly begins working the machinery to make him a viable candidate (i.e. making it so he duty posts keep in Europe and away from people he knows, thereby cutting off his ties to others).  Muir reappears in Bishop's life at a key moment where he feels Bishop will be most suggestible to CIA work.  After putting Bishop through a couple of quick tests, Muir concludes that he will make an excellent operative and thus begins a relationship of more than 15 years (which this movie covers) in which the mentor continues to development and enhancement of his protg in the world of espionage.<BR>   Of course, if that alone was the movie, \\"Spy Game\\" would have come across as a compelling look at the challenges this men take on and the sacrifices they make in the name of service to the country.  Unfortunately, there is a whole separate act to this movie running parallel to this back story.  In involves a current day operation (which, in this movie, is 1991) where Bishop, acting independently, poses as a public health worker to infiltrate a Chinese prison and free some unknown hostage.  The mission gets compromised and Bishop gets scheduled for execution.  When Muir's superiors at the CIA get wind of this, they essentially interrogate him about his relationship with Bishop while also trying to distance themselves from this action, lest an international incident occurs with China while trade talks are in the balance.  In between Q&A sessions, Muir works hard behind the scenes to try and free Bishop (for he feels partly responsible for his predicament, even though he had no direct knowledge of it).  During these sequences, the whole back story of Muir and Bishop is explained.  The problem is, the present day situation isn't very compelling or interesting.  When the movie ends, you realize that you got about 90 minutes of back story and only about 10 minutes of actual plot.  That leads to inevitable feelings of disappointment when one realizes that this movie could have been so much more.  Interestingly, had it been less, it would have been more.  As it has been said, the back story of the relationship between Muir and Bishop is very well done and quite compelling.  Left as that, this movie would have been enough.  The tacked-on modern storyline just bogs down the rest of the picture and doesn't add much of anything to the entire package.  \\"Spy Game\\" is still a good watch.  It's just a shame it didn't become more than in is.
B00005JL3A|2.0|This film falls flat in many aspects. I really wanted to like this movie, but the only reason for this was because I am such a huge fan of the games. However, I feel that this film does not do the video game classic justice. It DOES have an all new story, and it DOES have all new characters. However, this surprisingly is not the reason that I disliked it. I am rather thrown off as to why this film is getting such good reviews by other Amazon.com customers, because in my opinion, the movie is a mindless escapade through one obstacle and another. The film tries to go for intense plot twists, however, the makers of the film must not have realized that if they want intriguing plot development, an existent plot is required. The video games really do give you a sense of uneasiness, however, all this film offers is a brainless combination of Night of the Living Dead and Die Hard. People say that it's no big deal that the story doesn't follow the game, but it is. Reason being, the film IS based on the game, so I'm sorry, but YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THE GAME'S PREMISE. I don't give juvenile reviews based on how attractive the lead stars are, OR on the blood content, I base them on how good the movie was, hence the two stars.
0375703764|5.0|I love this book. It blends the idea of novels, articles, films, television and the internet. It's a horror novels that exploded into something better and more exciting. It's like Jorge Luis Borges went drinking with Stephen King, and was joined by David Foster Wallce (on a journalism kick); then the whole thing was blended up by Jeff Noon and put back together by a stoned Stephen Hawking and read to you by John Malkovich after a three-day bender. But better.<br />Read it or despair.
B000002UAO|5.0|This album is so good that many rock bands have not even come close to this. Songs like &quot;Drive My Car&quot; and &quot;The Word&quot; are still ahead of their time. Even though the Beatles had moved past cover versions of other artist's songs, and had not yet entered their pychedelic phase, this is still good, solid rock and roll. I like how progressive the music was getting with new experimentation. You can tell that the Beatles and George Martin put alot of time and energy into this record. And when it was originally released, the photography blew me away. Quality art lasts forever. That's why this album has become a classic. Definitely one of the Beatles' best.
B00004TEWP|5.0|Personally, this is my favorite of Britney's albums. It's upbeat, and really fun to listen to. Plus her three extra tracks, Heart, Girl in the Mirror, and You Got it All, are some of my favorite songs. Especially Girl in the Mirror, which will probably speak to all girls my age. Buy this album - it's essential for all Britney fans!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavinge's new and first album \\"Lets Go\\" is amazingly great. 1 thing i dont understand though is wats the difference between \\"complicated\\" and \\"Complicated (Matrix Mix Bonus Track)\\" THEY SOUND THE SAME!!! but its a great cd anyway. I recomend this to any punk rocker looking for a new artist. THIS IS A ARTIST TO WATCH.
B00005OAIE|5.0|i first heard John Mayer playing in my friends dorm room before he ever came out on the radio or vh1. i thought at first it was dave mathews - but he is no such thing! even before i bought the cd myself, neon was stuck in my head, and then, oh my god!, i heard \\"your body is a wonderland\\" and i KNEW i loved john mayer. i mean seriously who thinks to say \\"ill never let your head hit the bed without my hand behind it.\\" i bought the cd and played it over and over and over again. i was, and still am, addicted, but rightfully so b/c now ive got all my friends in love too.
B00003CWL6|4.0|Kevin Spacey plays a sexually frustrated, suburban, male head of household who's fed up with his career and chucks it.  His wife is a hypocritical, bitchy career woman with no sexual interest in her husband.  We have the teenage daughter caught in the crossfire and the power struggles. And then there are the wacky neighbors!   Everybody acts out, and there you have the movie!  It should have been named American Tragedy, but Hollywood likes to lighten things up.  They don't like things to get too serious, lest anyone actually learn something.<br />I thought the moviemakers took some typical American issues, like violence, infidelity, and a few others and brought them together.  The moviemakers took the essential drama of these things and made everything else ice-cream parlor suburban.  They didn't show any of the filthy side garbage that actually goes along with this kind of thing in reality. <br />Lester and Carolyn Burnam have a teenage daughter named Jane.   A new family, the Fitts, moves in next door.   Mr. Fitts is a Colonel in the United States Marine Corp.  His son, Ricky Fitts is in high school with Jane.  Colonel Fitts wife, Barbara, is a basket case.  Jane knows about Ricky from the rumor mill.  He used to go to school with them but was sent away to an institution.<br />The movie made me laugh my ass off.   I couldn't take it seriously, like most people did.  Few people that I have spoken too took it as a comedy.  Although the Lester Burnham is hilarious, that's all there is to him.  His phony wife is as superficial as the business suites she wears.  Her method of dealing with a serious emotional issue is to chant slogans learned at a sales seminar at a Holiday Inn.   She (played by Annette Benning) is so empty and absurd you have to laugh at her.  Mother and father had no depth at all.   However, the acting of Kevin Spacey, who played Lester Burnham, was outstanding, a \\"10.\\"   His acting pulled the whole movie to a higher level.  All of the characters werewell balanced, although the moviemakers should have spent more time expounding on the character of Thora.  I felt she was essential to understanding the movie.<br />I felt the marine colonel who lived next door was almost real.  The character was obviously created by an insightful, gay screen-writer with a sharp politically-correct ax to grind.  For what little time he spent on screen, the character had showed much more depth than the other two adults.  The only thing I'm skeptical about is that he was so extreme, I'm not even sure if the Marine Corp would put up with him these days.<br />Angela, an aspiring model and girl friend of Jane's is a whole pick-up truck full of insecurities and inside-out values.  You can see plenty of girls like her every day on the daytime talk shows.   She's utterly pathetic.<br />Ricky, the high school kid next door is a sicko of the first order.  Think Colombine High School.  He's become a tremendous financial success selling drugs.  Initially I felt anxiety about the relationship between Lester Burnam and Ricky, but ended up thinking it was healthy for the both of them, except for the drugs, of course.<br />The real characters in the movie were the daughter, Thora, and the kid next door, Ricky.    The daughter had a fair dose of intelligence and common sense and pretty good emotional maturity for a girl of her age.  She was introspective and sized up other people very well, her parents, her girl friend and Ricky.  She knew she needed her parents to be parents.  Psychologically, she was quite robust and healthy.  She will survive and thrive, despite her knucklehead parents.  Ricky, the high school kid next door was real.   He was very intelligent, very talented and had a good personality.   I don't think most viewers realize what a wonderful person he could have grown up to be, had things been otherwise.   In the future, he could have been a successful professional in any field he chose.  I can easily imagine him selling corporations instead of drugs.  The problem was that psychologically, he was damaged beyond repair by his sado-masochistic, homosexual, homophobic father.  Ricky is the real tragedy of the movie.<br />Thora and Ricky symbolize American society, she the healthy part, he the dysfunctional.   And together they go off, hand-in-hand-our future.
0312265859|4.0|i loved this book and so should u. it was entertaining, hillarious, and a best buy from amazon.com. pick it up, and discover the humour the author has to offer. also, i recommend the other 7 books that the author has published. happy reading!!!
0792843835|4.0|This is a film that nicely illustrates the way people's lives affect each other.  It does so with humor at times and poignancy at times.  There is a surreal quality to it.<br />The one scene that I was not expecting was the painting scene, when Palance exhibits Ruebenesque skill.  And that scene came off quite well showing the unexpected beauty of the star.  <br />The chemistry was indeed just right for the three main characters.  The direction and cinematography alternated between keeping one on edge and then gratifying our senses.  <br />This indeed was a &quot;sleeper&quot;, and if it did slip past you, I recommend heartily to see it for a very different treat to the eyes.
B00003CXI0|5.0|but for a movie adaptation of the first book of the Potter series, this movie has alot going for it.  The cast is wonderful--just as I pictured each and every character--especially Snape and Hagrid. My favorite is Ron.  He is a perfect Weasley.  I teach language arts in middle school and my students all love this movie.  There is something for every interest--and it is just a great escape for an afternoon or evening.
B00005JL3A|5.0|First of all I would like to say that I thought Jovovich made a very good Jill Valintine.Also I would like to point out that this movie covers only Jills first adventure and ends at the begining of RE3,Jills second adventure.The characters were awsome especily the hell hounds (zombie dogs) and the Licker (the one with the exposed brain and claws).The zombies were ok, but in the game there flesh is more decayed.overall i loved this movie and i hope they make a sequal that describes the Nemesis story.
0151008116|3.0|The premise of a boy shipwrecked and wandering on the sea with a dangerous menagerie in a journey towards faith seems fresh, exciting, and drew me to this book.  However, despite some of the best reviews i have read for a book lately, I was completely dissappointed with the execution of what seemed to be such a promising novel.<br />For the first 100 pages, readers are introduced to Pi Patel, an endearing boy who samples religions and declares himself a Hindu, Christian, and a Muslim.  He finds himself torn between making a definitive religion his, and wants to follow a philosophy of faith and love.  As he moves to Canada on a cargo ship with his family and the zoo animals they are relocating to North America, disaster strikes and he finds himself on a small lifeboat with a hyena, an orangutan, a zebra, and a bengal tiger.  A Robinson Crusoe-esque journey ensues, as the novel is told through the perspective of the boy.<br />While the first 100 pages left me salivating for more, I was utterly disappointed with Martel's follow up on his themes.  Once Pi is castaway the novel becomes a survival narrative and the religious ideas are left behind and only shallowly explored.  Imagination abounds in this novel, but it's promise of a story that will make you believe in God seems to be ignored for other interests within the narrative.  The end result is a disjointed argument about religion and a plot that makes you feel as though you've read three different novels rather than one.  The twists at the end of the novel raise issues of truth, but the themes of the novel seem to have been dropped for sheer adventure and drawn out shipwreck narrative so it feels as though it is merely tacked on at the end to try to regain more literary value.<br />Life of Pi is a good read, boldly imaginative, but not as substantive as it could have been.
B000068IEU|5.0|IT IS TRUE THAT A COMPLETE UNCUT VERSION OF THIS FILM MAY NOT EXIST BUT WHO CARES THIS FILM IS VERY MEAN-SPIRITED AND DAVID HESS RULES. WES CRAVEN'S DIRECTING SURE ISN'T IN TOP FORM BUT HE DELIVERS THE GOODS TO US PERVERTS OUT THERE. HEY...YOU CAN'T GO WRONG FOR THIS PRICE FROM MGM.

B000000Y2F|5.0|This album has been recognized as one of those \\"must have\\" jazz records--as it should be. But it isn't exactly what the album title promises. Yes, Coltrane and Monk are here, but this curious little collection showcases the short-lived Thelonius Monk quartet featuring John Coltrane in a few tracks and then pads out the remainder with miscellaneous material. The album was originally issued on Jazzland, a Riverside subsidary, and the Monk/Trane quartet tracks were augmented by alternate takes from a session that produced the Riverside LP \\"Monk's Music\\" (\\"Off Minor\\" and \\"Epistrophy') and another alternate take from \\"Thelonius Himself\\" (\\"Functional\\" a Monk solo). Sadly, only five of the six tracks have Coltrane. When you hear this record, you've got to remember that Coltrane was not yet considered the great jazz musician he is known to be. Nor had Monk fully achieved his deserved apotheosis. Consequently, Monk and Trane weren't recorded when they played together as they should have been, and this album was almost an afterthought. Perhaps Riverside issued the Jazzland record because there wasn't enough material for a whole LP or perhaps it was a marketing ploy that presented the pairing on the budget label as sort of quirky stuff that some might like to hear. Whatever the case, the three quartet tracks are particularly important. These show kindred voices, magnificent interplay between Monk and Coltrane, and you hear Coltrane evolving his tenor style to help define classic Monk. Two jazz monsters emerging. The main sessions presented on \\"Monk's Music\\" complete the picture.
B00005O3VC|5.0|MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL is a comedy classic that is in a league all by itself. The FAB SIX of comedy put their take on the Arthurian legend with outrageous humor both visually slapstick and a script to tickle the ear. Expanding their classic television show into a movie and having each of the troup taking on numerous parts, this is a comedy for both Python lovers and people not familiar with Python. With the opening scene of King Arthur galloping, with his \\"patsy\\" banging coconut shells to make the sounds of a horse trotting,viewers know they are along for a very irreverent ride. Each of the Pythons take on the roles of the different Knights of the Round Table and their different adventures on trying to find the elusive HOLY GRAIL. Each individual adventure is hilarious and even more hilarious when they meet up to band together in their \\"sacred quest\\". There are too many classic scenes to point out, because the film is all over the place and there is no slow or unfunny moments. There are musical numbers, illogical logic, thrown about animals,secrets revealed about the African and European Swallow,nasty French Knights, Knights who say \\"Ni!\\",shrubberies, dismemberments,and political humor to satisfy all sorts of comedy tastes. This is probably one of the best comedies ever made. The Special Edition DVD has all the bells and whistles including two sets of audio commentaries pairing members of the Python troup, and there is a great segment included in which Terry Jones and Micheal Palin visit some of the original site locations used in the film. Note: Classic Line - (King to Son looking out the castle window)- \\"Someday all this will be yours...\\", (Son to King) \\"What, the curtains?\\"
B000000993|5.0|...and really makes your innards crawl.  Opiate is good, but this album is only outdone by Lateralus.
B00003CWOL|1.0|This has to be the worst DVD I ever bought!  Not only was the movie boring, but it was also quite annoying due to the extremely terrible acting -- Ben Affleck and Matt Damen needed to be smacked for their horrid performances in this film.  The only characters that manage to draw any giggles or smiles at all were Jay and Silent Bob, but well... that's been done before already, and it's just not enought to carry the whole movie.  See this movie only if you want to get a good baseline of what bad acting, script and film work are.
B00005YXZH|2.0|I, like some other reviewers, have tried to like this album. It has been in the cd player of my car for the past week and,well,uh<BR>I dunno...I just don't get it. It seems sometimes that artists just try too damn hard to sound indy and bury any decent song in a sludgy(and probably expensive) production. ... Of course, taste is subjective but this thing just bores me to death.
0451204530|3.0|The book is a great read. Yeah i agree with many people that it wasn't exactly the \\"MASTERPIECE\\" people have come to expect from Ken Follet, but i supposed that's waht makes his other books, MASTERPIECES... (They can't all be masterpieces)<br />First i sort of agree with a Reviewer who wrote \\"I was appalled at all the anachronisms and mistakes\\"... and i would like to add another one i didn't quite see here (yet). Doesn't Billie at one point say something like... \\"nope, that's all she wrote!\\"... Is that in reference to the \\"Murder She Wrote\\"... Maybe i'm wrong but was \\"Murder She wrote\\" around in 1958???<br />I hope i don't sound like i didn't like the book. It was realy entertaining, and although at some points you did have to \\"swallow\\" what he was saying just for the story to continue, it was thick and hard at times... (LOTS of luck for one person in just 48 hours).<br />One thing i think that i can bring to this review table that i don't think i've read anybody say is that i think this book would (or could possibly have been) one of those \\"Typical Follet\\" books, (like needle, pillars, rebecca) if the story ended and Anthony was the good guy, and that Luke was in fact the bad guy (as Anthony was maintaining).<br />He had me convinced that Anthony was the bad guy far before it said it in black and white, so my normal thinking was : well, if he's got me so convinced that Anthony is the bad guy, and that luke is the good guy, then it must be the opposite...<br />I don't know: when the story ended, and i never saw that page turn saying \\"Anthony was right all along... it had been Luke who was the spy!\\"... That would have turned stuff around!<br />All together there are 3 stars because its a VERY entertaining book. And that's why he wrote it. Lost a star because its not a masterpiece, and one for all the crap i had to swallow to get through it, and so only those masterpieces should get the 5.<br />One last point: I dind't even bother to read the \\"Rocket\\" story that preceeded every chapter (pertaining to 1958). I waited until the last 35 pages to read back through, so it was fresh in my memory when the rocket actually launched... And i think that made it better...
B00000I07R|5.0|THIS ALBUM MADE BON JOVI A REAL ROCK LEGEND!

B0000508U6|5.0|I first heard Coldplay's Sparks on the HBO show The Mind of the Married Man. Brought me to tears then, and does every time I hear the song now. I love this album. And I say that, oh about, NEVER. It's sweet and sad without being sappy. It's perfect for rainy weekends at home or as background music at a dinner party. It's grown-up music for grown-up people. Totally original - not Travis or Radiohead. (Why do people insist on trying to compare these bands!?) Perfect from beginning to end. I absolutely cannot wait until Rush of Blood to the Head is released!!
B00000J2PH|5.0|Man, has it really been over thirty years since I saw the pom-pon girls from our high school do their basketball game halftime show to &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot;?  Game after game as a matter of fact.  I didn't get tired of watching the show then, and don't get tired of listening to the song now.  I'll even bet Carole King is in better shape these days then some of those pom-pon girls.  <br />Oh yes, there are other songs on the album, and by golly, they're all good.  My favorite is &quot;Smackwater Jack&quot;, and like &quot;I Feel...&quot;, my only wish to improve the album would be to have a few more bouncier songs like these in the collection, especially since she wrote so many lively toons in the 60's. <br />But this is the album that pays homage to Carole King, the serious songwriter, and in that category, it's a magnificent work.  I was not into the big hit of the album &quot;It's Too Late&quot; when it came out, as I was looking for more rock and roll.  But now as middle age is probably already here, relistening to the nice jazzy arrangements and forlorn lyrics help me declare that yes, this was a great piece.  <br />As part of the homage to the songwriter, a great stroke here was to record two of her songs that were hits with other artists.  Both &quot;... A Natural Woman&quot; and &quot;You've Got a Friend&quot; are nicely done here, with me liking the latter a lot more.  Perhaps it's just impossible to wreck a song that says so much so simply.  <br />As for the &quot;bonus tracks&quot; on the album, one is a studio song, and one a live recording.  The first, &quot;Out in the Cold&quot; is nice, but it's not a reason to get the album or avoid it.  The live version of &quot;Smackwater Jack&quot; is muddy, and should have been left off.  Otherwise, this is one for the ages.
B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|11 year old Harry Potter (Daniel Redcliffe) was a troubled orphan as he is being raised by his horrid uncle Vernon (Richard Griffith) and Aunt Pentunia (Fiona Shaw) with rotten cousin Dudley (Harry Meling) since he was a baby left on the doorstep. But when a friendly large man named Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) brings him an important message that he is a wizard born of extraordinary magical powers, he heads into the world of wizards and witches where anything magical is possible for he is assigned to head to the legendary Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardy made by headmaster Professor Dumbledore (Richard Harris). Along the way on his first year at the school he befriends Ronald Weasley (Rupert Grin) and feisty Heromine Granger (Emma Watson) including a new foe named Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) but there is some hidden secrets that are unknown to all students known as The Sorcerer's stone which has great powers, now Harry Potter must find out the mysteries of his past including why his parent died.<br /><br />A brilliant and faithful adaptation of the book! this family fantasy adventure co-stars John Cleese, John Hurt, Warwick Davis, Maggie Smith (\\"Clash of the Titans\\") and Alan Rickman as cruel Professor Snape. Here an awesome new fantasy franchise is born thanks to great reviews and strong box-office reception including crowd-pleasing stuff, here is a movie that proves that kids could act and what great acting choices they had. The special Effects by The Jim Henson Creature Shop and Industrial Light and Magic are fantastic but the storyline is what really matters here for it's complex yet a bit simple at times, it was followed by even better sequels.<br /><br />This DVD has beautiful picture and sound that only an HP fan like myself would love as it's very theatrical quality. The extras are good too like multi-language reel, yearbook character clips, featurettes, Lessons in Quidditch and whatever it takes to hatch a dragon egg, and trailers to all HP movies.
0684135051|5.0|This book is an absolute must-have if you really love knitting. It's filled with so many practical tips and hints that your average how-to book just doesn't cover. This isn't directed towards the newbie, it is NOT a \\"learn to knit\\" book. But if you have a basic understanding of knitting, love the craft, and want to become even more skillful, this book is for you. Even if for no other reason, you must own it for the completely SEAMLESS SWEATER pattern... it's SO much easier that you would ever think!! EZ had a talent for writing in such a way that she makes you feel like you have a seasoned knitter right there with you as you navigate your way through knitting. This book is a wonderful \\"friend\\" as you further your skills. After I read it, I seriously had a boost of confidence in my own knitting.
B00004XPPB|5.0|This movie was one of the best Mafia movies I've ever seen.  I'm really big into movies like that (Goodfellas, Godfather) and I didn't think it was going to be that good.  I was wrong!  Al Pacino and Johnny Depp do an exemplory job.  I have the DVD version, and its amazing how much Johnny Depp sounds like Joe Pistone.  All in all, this movie is definitely worth buying!
0312265859|1.0|It's time to wrap this thing up!  This one's a labor to get through.  The characters are dull and very predictable. A few more cars are destroyed... That said, number nine isn't needed.  Don't buy it,  borrow someone else's--better yet, TAKE my copy!
B000067CPX|2.0|These were the mottos for this cd...<br />I was looking forward to some RCHP...but this doesn't even sound like it....I really really liked Californication....because it was melodic and had crazy solos....well this doesn't have anything...it's just all melody....I mean I like Melody...but not this kind of boring melody...Melody is a must in the music world...but RHCP never need this much melody to be a [great] band before.<br />John Fruciante's solos have gone out the door on this cd....maybe that's why i'm so dissapointed....I mean, there are solos on this cd...but most of his solos have been replaced by wierd electronic effects.<br />Contrary to what the Spin Magazine article said...Flea is not himself.  He has replaced himself with a bassist that just follows the guitarist riffs...<br />Hopefully I just didn't make a lot of RHCP fans not want to buy it.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|I had always had a transcendental experience with Prince's previous albums.  However with this album something else happened.  After listening it for the first time, I was greatly annoyed by the lyric content and the narrator's voice.  I had made up my mind to give it up, but watching him perform \\"The Everlasting Now\\" at Jay Leno's Show changed my mind.  Perhaps, in the back of my mind I still expected him to sing the same way he used to.  So, I listened to it again without overanalyzing it.  I experienced the most peaceful, blissful, ecstatic and lovely feeling.  I just love the way he sings-with such deep love for God and music.  It is very inspiring and uplifting.  All 14 tracks are my favorites.
B000002LND|5.0|This CD is the best, in my opinion. As a converted Madonna fan (thanks, Marianne!), this CD has some of her best songs (the others are on \\"Something to Remember\\", her compilation of ballads and slower songs). Here are my thoughts on these great songs. \\"Holiday\\" screams \\"80s-girl pop-spring break\\" song but is still cute. \\"Lucky Star\\" is a bit more mature but along the lines of \\"Holiday.\\" \\"Borderline\\" is a passionate poppy love song. \\"Like a Virgin\\" is the controversial tune that we all knew it would be. \\"Material Girl\\" is a bit campy, but cool. \\"Crazy for You\\" is good, with a cool beginning. Makes me imagine two lovers in a steamy room...sitting across the card table from each other? Don't ask, but that's what I think of!! A good danceable tune is \\"Into the Groove.\\" My personal favorite is \\"Live to Tell,\\" a song so haunting that I can picture a scene and story in my head upon hearing any part of the song. \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" easily surpasses Kelly Osbourne's new cover in quality. \\"Open Your Heart\\" is good too. \\"La Isla Bonita\\" is another of my favorites, with a nice tropical Latin theme. \\"Like a Prayer\\" is another controversial goodie. \\"Express Yourself\\" is also great. \\"Cherish\\" follows the styles of \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Lucky Star\\", but is still nice. Favorite lyric from \\"Cherish\\": \\"Romeo and Juliet/They never felt this way I bet.\\" \\"Vogue\\" is very cool, with Madonna's recitation of famous old-Hollywood icons, including Marilyn Monroe. \\"Justify My Love\\" and \\"Rescue Me\\", her two previously unreleased songs on \\"The Immaculate Collection\\", are racy but good. (Lenny Kravitz helps out on one of these.) All in all, this CD is terrific and I recommend it to anyone for an instant older-Madonna fix. This CD does the trick. A++++
0790729342|3.0|Hard to get involved in a non-story with an indifferent lead. It's basically two hours of car crashes and killing with the production designer as star. Fair dinkums, sport. It's looks pretty dapper on the PC while you're strangling a Croc, or whatever kids do nowadays after school. The message is that when society breaks down human beings will do nothing but kill each other. I think that's a vicious slur on humanity. We torture people first and then we kill them. Actually, they do that it in this film, as well. Bang goes the review.
6300214435|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. After having seen the first in the series, Raiders of the Lost Ark, I was looking forward to more lighthearted entertainment. Sadly, however, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom had several elements which really annoyed me.<br />First of all, although it had its funny and exciting moments (especially the first scene in the nightclub when Indy is searching for the antidote to the poison he drank), this movie was essentially too violent for its own good. I don't mind a good action movie, but when the action element is excessive it becomes aggravating. I feel that Raiders, which had less action (and less gruesome action) was far better. Some may disagree...but I think this movie had TOO MUCH violence for an Indiana Jones movie (I expect less violence, more humor).<br />Most importantly, the basic premise of the movie was pretty racist. Essentially, Spielberg based this movie on a 1938 classic adventure, Gunga Din, which starred Cary Grant. I have seen Gunga Din: it is a movie that condones, if not fully supports, imperialism. In many ways, it is still a good movie - but the ideas in it have to be ignored completely. Now, that movie was made in 1938. Although not great, having imperialist propaganda in a movie made in 1938 is SOMEWHAT understandable. But this movie was made in 1984! Things should have improved...the view of foreign countries as barbaric and savage is no longer acceptable!<br />Don't get me wrong - I like Indiana Jones movies. But Temple of Doom is my LEAST favorite because it has 2 big flaws: too much violence, and the idea of foreign countries as inferior. That is why I could only give it 3 stars. Come on...let's not be stuck in the 1930s...there are dozens of other, non-offensive, plots that Spielberg could have used. Oh well. Luckily we have the other 2 Indy movies to remind us how much fun adventure movies can be! So don't get this movie, get the other 2.
B000005HN6|5.0|Orchid, Opeth's debut CD is widely known for it's dark, melancholic, sometimes seemingly endless acoustic passages. I don't think any band's first album comes even close to the greatness of Orchid. \\"In the Mist she was Standing\\" also has some medieval sounding, brilliant melodies. You'll love the dark, haunted, speedy 3-minutes piano piece \\"Silhouette\\". The vocals on Orchid aren't top notch, but they aren't really too common. Raw death growls, some clean singing and even whispering once in a while. \\"Under the Weeping Moon\\" has a very long acoustic part which you'll seem to get lost in, and it sounds better when listening with headphones because the sounds echo from ear to ear. One of Opeth's most classic and memorable songs is \\"The Twilight is My Robe\\" because of the brilliant acoustic passages. \\"Requiem\\" is a short nice instrumental track, and the intro to \\"The Apostle in Triumph\\" is very nice.<br />In conclusion, If you're quite new to Opeth, this will probably be one of you're last albums you plan on getting. It takes a lot longer to understand and appreciate, and is a lot different then their newer work, but it will not dissapoint you.
B00005ATQD|4.0|An inscrutable and misunderstood film about titillation and disappointment,  sex and death. Kubrick briliantly cast actors in the title roles about whom audiences would have certain expecations, expectations which Kubrick intentionally did not meet. Thus the protagonist's constant confusion and disappointment is extended beyond the film itself and into the audience. Not an 'easy' film.
B000067CPX|3.0|overall i like the album. Its about as good as californication, but different. This cd is much more vocal with john singing all of the background vocals and playing the keyboard. It has a refreshing new sound. But its no blood, sugar, sex, magic or Mothers Milk. They were just too good to ever top that. But at least its better than one hot minute with Navarro. that album was pathetic.  Overall good album, but very poppy. Any album with John Frusciante can't be that bad. He's the greatest of all time.
0671027344|1.0|I really didn't like this book.<br />  The main character was emotionally disturbed and he was really hard to relate to.  He was practically a social outcast, and this book made me cringe because he was so naive.  Charlie was so immature and stupid, but the book tries to make him seem gifted.  <BR>  This book was just really strange, and I don't recommend it for anyone.  I read half of it, and I wish there was some way I could remove it from my memory.
0385505833|5.0|Grisham is out of his element, however, he did a supurb job.<br />This was a funny and entertaining book.  It was predictible and often like real life.<br />I enjoyed it because it was so typical of everyday life in the US.<br />Thanks for the good read.
0385720920|2.0|The entire first chapter of this book tells you to put it down and walk away - do it! I should have taken the advice, I hope your smart enough to listen. But a few hours later I realized my mistake when I found the book droning on and on about some schmuck with a sex addiction problem. First, the sexual encounters described in the book are completely unbelievable unless there really is someone out there who has had it with an entire hospital nursing staff. Second, the only interesting part of the book, concerning his mother's diary was destroyed by a completely bland ending involving what I can only call a \\"moment of clarity\\" experienced by his mother. The ending is boring, the book was rotten and I wish I could get my money back!! I give it two stars only because the moments he describes working in the colonial village were pretty funny - although those too were often destroyed by overused references to drugs and sex. Follow the advice of the first chapter, do not read this book!!! This was no Fight Club!!!
B00005N5RM|4.0|1988's The Blob is a sure horror movie for any type of horror movie fan. And for a remake, it does justice for its original. A feat some remakes never come close to doing. Maybe that's just my personal opinion, and I stand true to it. <br /> The film's not just an update to the 1958 version of The Blob, it's more of a different turn on the story. We're taken to a small town where basically everyone knows everyone. It's your average day Mayberry type deal. We're introduced to many residents of the town, but the two main ones are the star cheerleader (Shawnee Smith as Meg Penny) and the town rebel (Kevin Dillon as Brian Flagg). When the two cross paths as a result of some of the blob's terror, we follow these two as they fight for their town and for their lives.<br /> The Blob has a pretty equal formula for a great, fun horror movie. Of course for any horror movie, there's got to be tense scenes. The film has it's share of some. Most noteable are the whole diner / diner lady chase scene, and the oh-too-great theatre / sewer chase scene. Those two scenes are basically the whole movie, but they make for great viewing! Not only for the intensity, but for the great shooting and colorizations that are there. And the gore? Aw man, the gore is plentiful here. We get gooey body parts, the blob engulfing and then melting body parts off, and more of the gooey melted body parts. It's crazy. Yet not totally overdone. If I dare say, \\"tastefully\\" done to please any gore fiend. As usual, for any horror movie, we get cliched characters, but they are all handled well here. Shawnee Smith is wonderful as the heroine. She kicked major [behind] here. Kevin Dillon is kind of stale at some times in the movie, but he pulls through and makes a viewer happy. The supporting cast have their own little perks. <br /> Chuck Russell, director of The Blob, knew what he was doing when he made this movie. And in itself, 1988's The Blob has become it's own cult classic.
B00005JKNC|3.0|Unless you're a collector or a hard-core fan of Jim, why would you buy it??  I'd say wait for it to come on National TV and then watch it and get disappointed anyway.
0571202284|5.0|I do declare this is the best study of animation I've ever read!  Although I'm a Doctor, and much rather cut people up, I would highly prescribe this to all animators.  After all I am a doctor.  And I do know what I'm talking about.<BR>Dr. Mangor
B00003CY0V|3.0|Yes, the only reason I watched this film is that I think Hugh Jackman is such a terrific leading man.  He didn't disappoint me here either.  I thoroughly enjoyed him as a top notch computer hacker newly released from prison who is trying to get his life together.  He is recruited by John Travolta to do the computer hack of a lifetime for a huge monetary score.<br /><br />Where this film is preposterous though is with that John Travolta role.  His playing a criminal mastermind is so over the top that I found myself laughing out loud every time he came on camera to indulge in yet more action adventure violent excess.  Halle Berry is unrecognizable as the same actress who stars in \\"Monster's Ball\\" and is probably glad of that fact.  She was strictly undressed window dressing in this film.  Next to Hugh Jackman, the other two saving graces to the film are: 1) a 360-degree panoramic stop motion bombing scene that is incredibly artistic albeit violent and 2) a huge bus being carried over a city by a helicopter as Travolta's getaway vehicle.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00005NB8J|2.0|After watching this film, I asked myself one question:<br />HOW did MGM and the new (and better!) writers get from THIS awful piece of science fiction junk to the excellent, award-winning tv series?!? <br />Well, for a start they got a new leading man in the form of Richard Dean Anderson. Due to his own unique sense of humour, the character of Jack O'Neill was re-written from guilt-ridden, suicidal soldier of the movie to a caring, handsome and funny man whom the audience can actually give a damn about. <BR>Secondly, they re-cast the role of Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and added Captain Sam Carter (Amanda Tapping) and Teal'c (Chris Judge) to make a complete team who actually seem like normal, believable characters and human beings rather than objects.<BR> I find it amazing how this TERRIBLE piece of cinema 'entertainment' produced something so great! And as for Mr Devlin and Mr Emmerich's comments about the series being dreadful, I have two words: Sour Grapes!
B00003CXXS|4.0|this movie is awesome!... i love it! i watch it all the time. it is a great movie. but it should have been 2 hours like the other two. it was ONLY 93 minutes. that is  one of the things i was diapointed about. the other thing is that it only shows the rex one time because the spinosaurus broke its neck during the fight. but overall it is a great movie. lots of dinosaurs. the raptors are still the best. ive had this movie since christmas.
0698119347|4.0|Stormbreaker was a very suspenseful book. The basic story line is about a 14 year old boy named Alex Rider. He is awaked one night to the sound of his doorbell. It turns out to be the police telling his housekeeper that his uncle Ian Rider died in a car crash. Ian had not worn his seal belt the police said, otherwise he would have lived. To Alex this seemed wrong, his uncle always made Alex wear his seat belt and Ian would have done likewise. Ian was a very careful man ... This is a very gripping book and should be enjoy by anyone who lives in suspense.
0930289234|5.0|I just recently got into graphic novels, but so far have read books from the SANDMAN series, The MAUS books, and of course, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS.  Needless to say, I've been sucked into the genre by these amazing stories, and I'm simply going down the list of highly acclaimed cult classics.  Of course, when I got to WATCHMEN, I was skeptical.  I'd heard of Batman and Sandman, but who the Watchmen?  Sounded kind of obscure, and fraknly, a bit phony.  Of course, after reading countless positive reviews claiming this book to be one of the absolute best in the history of comic literature, I had to pick it up.  Right off the bat, I could tell there was something special about this one, which maybe wasn't so noticeable in the others I'd read.<br />The story starts out simple enough, with the murder of a \\"superhero,\\" called The Comedian.  He was evidently a member of a team, but only one of his former comrades, Rorschach  seems to care about his death in the slightest.  The others all remember him as a bad, immoral man, and therefore, a terrible hero.  At first, you'll be wondering why the others don't grieve for him as Rorschach does, but as you see what foul deeds he committed, you'll start arguing the other way.  Why is it that Rorschach is scouring the streets, searching for clues as to who may have killed The Comedian?  Why is Rorschach the only one who cares about the ex-superhero's falling?<br />In this book, much like in THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, superheroes are not seen simply as idols and virtual gods through the eyes of the public.  They're seen as a rebellious vigilante who disregard the police and take matters into their own hands.  This is the story of an alternate 1985 where the world is rapidly turning into a hell which humans are creating for themselves, where superheroes struggling for internal-order are hated and ridiculed for their valiant actions.  The superheroes themselves aren't all that important here--they simply represent the steriotypical masked figures in tights; a group of \\"normal\\" citizens fighting to change matters which may very well be out of their control.  Alan Moore masterfully creates a multilayered epic sporting a fantastic script, filled with controversial dialogue and an interesting plot which changes the way people think about superheroes and comic books in general.<br />Rorschach's search for truth, along with the reader's search for explanation is explored through a series of flashbacks, side-stories and subplots.  The 417 page graphic novel is split into 12 chapters, each with little tidbits in-between, providing some interesting background information on the characters.  WATCHMEN is kind of a mini-series of comic-books, and was entirely original.  The characters had never appeared in any other comic before, and never appeared in another again.  When compared to THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, I say that WATCHMEN is slightly superior.  While THE DARK KNIGHT was an exciting and moving tale of Batman's aging and eventual returning to the superhero life, where he was needed most, it was very short (about half the length of WATCHMEN) and left open ends, which were covered in some not-as-good sequels.  WATCHMEN is simply a great solo-story which requires no background information or further reading, and boasts a strong, recurring theme: \\"Who watches the watchmen?\\"  Compared to other graphic novels, ranging mainly from 100-200 pages, WATCHMEN is significantly longer, not only giving you more of a bang for your buck, but increasing the amount of pleasure you'll experience from reading this book.<br />My only real gripe about this book is to do with the art.  Don't get me wrong--It's amazing stuff, filled with vivid colors that you wouldn't expect to see in such a dark story--but the action sequences leave something to be desired.  Compared to THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, filled with tons of cool blurs, lines and other cinematic goodies you'd expect to make a comic book feel more animated, WATCHMEN is severely lacking in that department.  If you try to see the book as a cartoon, like many of us do, it will look like a poorly animated one.  Or, simply a series of stills, which is what a comic book is, but almost all comics successfully create the illusion of animation and movement within their pages.  Nevertheless, the art is still amazing to look at, it will just require more imagination to see the characters moving.<br />If I were you, I wouldn't read any other reviews or check any futher into this great graphic novel.  If you do, you might back out, thinking that it sounds too corny or not your type of book.  Some people are turned off by the whole superhero idea, but Watchmen basically handles it in the most intimate and unconventional manner, bringing a whole new light to those imaginary masked-defenders of the Earth.  If you enjoyed THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, this should be right up your alley, delivering more of what the former excelled in.  If you aren't into comic books, then you should probably just head over to your nearest book store and read the first 10 pages or whatever.  Chances are, you'll find that you love this and then you can buy it on the spot.
0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold should get five stars for imagination alone. Her conception of the afterlife as seen through the eyes of a murdered fourteen year old is unique and original and will have you seeking out people who've read the book so you can talk about it.I found the book hard to put down once I started, and a little awed by the flood of emotions it managed to stir up. I've tried hard to stay away from reading many of the reviews until I was finished because I didn't want to know too much. Hard to classify: Ghost story? Suspenseful mystery? Painful and honest family portryal? It seems to capture so many different facets in an honest and affirming way I don't think you can help but be affected. This little girl, her life and death with stay with you. A book truly worthy of its accolades.
B000067CPX|4.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers have always been innovative, but this album tops the rest of their albums when it comes to diversity.  They've never ceased to amaze me throughout their 20+ year history.  &quot;By the Way&quot; is an album that shows just how much they have grown musically.  I'm not saying that this is their finest album (BloodSugarSexMajik will always be my personal favorite), but it does show maturity.  Their legendary funky/rappish sound can be found in &quot;By the Way&quot; and slightly in &quot;Minor Thing&quot; (my personal favorite).  However, songs like &quot;Universally Speaking&quot; confuses me--it almost sounds like pop, similar to the Barenaked Ladies.  I was quite impressed with &quot;On Mercury&quot;--I never thought that they could produce a ska-like sound like they did in that song.  &quot;Dosed&quot; is extremely trippish--John produces an awesome  yet simple guitar riff throughout the song.  &quot;Venice Queen&quot; has another amazing riff that's almost hynotic.  It's nice to hear the harmonizing in many of the songs.  As much as I LOVE Flea and John, they have sometimes drowned out Anthony's beautiful voice.  All four of them seem to come together to make an eclectic album.  It's a must have for any true Chili Pepper fan.
B00000811N|2.0|Unless you are really into Pink Floyd's most avant garde stuff (Atom Heart Mother and the Ummagumma studio album), you are unlikely to listen to this more than a couple of times. It gives only a little bit more insight as to what Pink Floyd would become. The other soundtrack albums from that period (including the often-overlooked Zabriskie Point) do much better in this regard. It has almost absolutely nothing in common with the material he wrote after The Dark Side of the Moon. If you are a Pink Floyd completist, go ahead and get it, but you will probably find that it compares with Nick Mason's Fictitious Sports as the least important Pink Floyd solo album.
B000067CPX|4.0|(4 and 1/2) To my suprise a I've seen a lot of negative reviews to this album.  You cannot deny the quality of the music on the album.  Each and every song is its own little world.  \\"Throw away you Television\\" is an amazing song...Anthony is amazing...Flea slaps is bass harder than anyone, while sounding better than anyone else out there...Chad Smith's banging drums, and psyhchedelic guitar from john.  There are to many good tracks to get into detail on each one.  Only a one or two songs that maybe get skipped, but usually you can listen to it all, It's heading more in the direction of Californication, rather than the Recently released Tricky album which featured John and Anthony.  I would like to see them coloborate again soon.   \\"By the way\\" sounds quite different from californication despite what I have read...This album is a must for any fan. buy it now.
0446608955|4.0|Everything was so great in the beginning.  The love betweet the two was fresh.  It was a love that I could only wish I would have.  I was narrowing in on the end and I knew what was coming.  But then the book shocked me with a highly unbelievable unding.  Marriage?  Give me a break.  It was sweet but in a real world that would never happen.  Also, like usual the book is 100% better than the movie but that's usually how it is.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|OK...I'll be fair. The SFX were astonishing. But if you want quality storytelling, stick with the George Pal version. THAT version has charm! This newer version does not. Not recommended.
B000067CPX|5.0|don't you just hate all those reviews by long time chili peppers fans that say <BR>'oh, well i've been listening to rhcp's ever since the good ol' days of mothers milk, but now they've made a serious mistake with their latest album...'<BR>whatever. this album is fantastic-and no, its not like mothers milk or blood sugar sex magic-and its nothing at all like one hot minute-but thats the beauty of music and musicians-PROGRESSION! and this album is a definate progression for the chili peppers, an amazing record that even makes me look forward to the drive to work in the morning so i can blast it out loud on my car stereo.  as far as the chilis albums go i would compare it to the rolling stones 'exile on main street'- an album which doesnt necessarily have any songs which stand out individually, but more a wall of sound.  each song compliments the last creating a complete masterpiece.  well done to the fabulous four-up, another triumph!  and to all those mothers milk moaners who wrote reviews on the day of 'by the way's release, go home and listen to the music a few times, then you'll come around.
B000067CPX|1.0|Yet another collection of boring lullabies from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.<br />Ever since the release of &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; the Chili Peppers have been in a musical funk, and ironically, funk is one of the things that has been missing from their latest musical offerings... along with energy and style.<br />If you are a longtime RHCP fan, don't let the high ratings fool you into buying this digital thorazine drip. I can almost guarantee that the people who are giving this cd high ratings had never heard of the Red Hot Chili Peppers until &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; became a hit... so they probably don't have a clue as to what a REAL Chili Pepper cd should sound like.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is incredible. When this movie was in theaters I did not know anything about it. When I bought it on DVD I found out that my life would not be complete with it. It has so many twists and turns that my head was almost spinning. Although many people have not heard of this movie I hope one day they will see it and enjoy it just as much as me. <BR>             Frank the man in the bunny suit. How original is that. Time travel? one subject that has not yet been explained that great in other movies before, is explained perfectly in this film. If you don't agree with me, so be it, but just for your information watch the movie, over, over, over, over, over, and over again to find out why I think it is so great and if you agree with me. GOOD FOR YOU.  See this movie if you have not already and enjoy it for the first time, or again for another time.<BR>Good Day.<BR>Soory if you had trouble reading this review, thank you for your time.
B00005T7HG|4.0|This wonderful production of the rock opera of the same name is truly a grat achievement for all involved.  Madonna gives what is almost certainly the only film performance she'll be remembered kindly for, and Banderas makes a very compelling, slightly sinister, Che.  Jonathan Pryce does a solid job as Juan Peron, though he does tend to talk through his songs as opposed to sing them.  There is, however, one serious flaw I would like to warn prospective buyers/viewers of:  the soundtrak was recorded separately from the film, and, while one cannot really fault director Alan Parker for the decision, one can blame him for its effect, which is to make the whol film look almost dubbed.  It is usually quite obvious the characters are not singing, especially when their mouths are not moving! All in all, though, well worth wacthing.
B00004RF97|5.0|&quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; is one of the finest examples of a 1940s comedy you could hope to find.  Adroitly written and directed, and with a fine cast including Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, James Stewart, and the inimitable Ruth Hussey, it is sweetly funny and completely enjoyable.  This film contains all the best aspects of an Old Hollywood comedy, and has thus stood the test of time.  No lingering scent of mothballs on this fine piece of cinema!
B00004RFCM|5.0|This show is certainly one of the dominant cultural forces on the landscape today, and here are its roots.  From the first episode's &quot;Toxic Bacelors&quot; through the big moment between Carrie and Mr. Big at the end of the last episode, there is not a false moment or wrong chord struck.  Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and my favorite, Miranda, dazzle us with their humor, their intelligence, and their amazing resilience in the face of seemingly impossible dating odds.  My favorite scene:  episode 3, &quot;Valley of the Twenty-Something Guys&quot;--the the discussion in the back of the taxi about Charlotte's boyfriend's request.  Priceless.
B00003CXI1|5.0|When the Harry Potter books came out, I was not one of the ones who rushed to the bookstores to read it.  In fact, I didn't even bother.  A fantasy story about child magicians?  Pish posh, I'm more into books on the level of Tolkien, I thought to myself oh-so-proudly.  I'm a decade too old to read children's fiction, I also thought to myself.<br />When the movie came out, I was one of the ones who didn't feel the slightest inkling to go see it.<br />But while I browsed through the shelves of the local video store looking for a light movie to watch, I decided to give Harry Potter a try.  <br />I was impressed, as was my husband.  Halfway through the video we were cheering Harry on and were absolutely glued to the screen.  The next day we went to the video store, this time to buy the DVD.<br />I was pleasantly surprised at how a story, geared for children, could hold and capture my attention.  It was absolutely delightful.  I think \\"delightful\\" is the best word to describe this movie.  The special effects don't detract from the plot, but help to further move it along.  The effects do their job and suck you into the world of Harry Potter.  This is truly a rare kind of movie, the kind that adults and children alike can enjoy watching together.  There is nothing too deep that children can't understand and there is nothing trite or painfully childish that adults will get bored of.  The thought and imagination that went into the story is brilliant.<br />The innocence of this film is something children will appeal to and adults can appreciate.  People of all ages will find entertainment in this film.<br />Watching this film was a lovely experience for me.  I relived sparks of childhood wonder I felt years ago from reading and watching books and films such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Absolutely refreshing and delightful.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Krall is smart, stylish and smooth.<br />Her rich intelligent tones linger long after the song has ended and the stereo has been de-powered for another night.<br />Her rhythmic reading of \\"I Remember You\\" is a case in point. It's a trite song with an even triter lyric but in the hands of Krall it becomes a memorable and evocative reflection of something lost but not forgotten.<br />In a world post-Ella, post-Morgana, Krall's timing and nuance is a genuine joy to behold.<br />\\"Dancing in the Dark\\" - and its notions of romantic love - is again delivered with surety and great style. Its tender message is articulated with deliberation, timing and a soft emotion that never degenerates into the sentimental.<br />On this wonderful five star affair, Krall's voice flows from the speakers with the reassuring and familiar tone of someone you know. Or wish you did.
B000067CPX|4.0|This band has really come a long way in the maturity dept. since Mother's Milk 13 years ago (their final infantile, but killer funk record). By The Way showcases a rock band realizing their musical potential without having to use image gimmicks, infantile raps and unnecessary thump bass to get the point across. At times they used to seem like an outfit that was &quot;being weird for the sake of being weird.&quot; Unbelievably, today's critics pass this trick off as talent (see almost any current band, except Tool). In some cases it is, albeit rare. The Peppers have always been great players. Frusciante, Flea and Smith are all adept at their respective trades and Keidis has become good singer at least in the studio. Frusciante is the main man creatively and on this record he really steps up. Wonderfully melodic choruses complete with &quot;doowop&quot; backing vocals that transcend the term, catchy. Dosed is one of the best tunes I've heard in a long time, not to mention most of the other cuts. If you enjoy good psychedelic pop with that Peppers sound, get it. This is a band that has already produced a masterpiece with Blood Sugar and a killer prelude to this new direction with Californication. It's a solid album from a more focused place and it should be remembered as one of their best. No matter what, it always has that RHCP vibe and that's what keeps me returning.
0380973650|5.0|Shadow is realeased from prison a couple days early for his wife's funeral he has no sense of purpose.  As luck would have it he meets a man named Wenesday(if you know any German you will see that this a clever joke)  This guy has a job for him and the result is a very good(if long) book.<br />I liked this book, seeing the old God's duke it out with the new Gods and those parts are very intersting but it falls apart in the last 50 pages and thusly leaves a sour taste in your mouth.
B000068QVN|5.0|Having missed all of the hysteria back during GFR's heyday, I must say that this CD definitely brings to light what all the hysteria was about. Live Album is good, but due to the restraints in technology at the time, it doesn't truly capture the raw power of this band! Grand Funk Railroad Live, the 1971 Tour is a must have if you want to experience the power of Grand Funk and learn what all the hysteria was all about back in 1971. You Just Gotta Get It! <br />lisah1upsetter
B00004Y87O|5.0|But whatever he is Kurt Russell proves that he can kick some major tail.  When New York has been turned into a prison this guy is the only one you can count on.  <br />Everything is great about this movie.  <br />Great sound track <BR>Great villian <BR>Great action <BR>Great...big 80s hair <br />an instant cult classic if you enjoyed MAD MAX you will enjoy this one
B000067CPX|4.0|If I had heard this cd before I knew who the peppers were, I would swear this was one of the best CDs I'd ever heard.  But I know who the peppers are, been a fan since Mother's Milk.  I keep waiting to hear the next... \\"Knock Me Down\\", the music that made me fall in love with RHCP in the first place.  So, I gave this CD a ranking of 4, and I know that is not fair because this is definately the album of the year, probably so far of the millenium.  Yeah, I agree with all the previous reviews that rated this album so high.  But I still wish they would have included at least one \\"Sir Psycho Sexy.\\"  Or one \\"Funky Monks.\\"  Just one, for an old time fan like myself.
0440180295|4.0|This book is not a typical book I would read. I wish I could say I gave it a try in order to expand my horizons and sample something different, but I started reading it out of boredom. At first I thought whoever wrote this book must have been on some major drugs, but as I started to get more into it, I realize that the book has a deeper message. <BR> The book describes the events during the Dresden bombing through the eyes of Billy Pilgrim, a simple man, who invents a very differnt way of dealing with things. Billy Pilgrim struck me as one of the happiest people on earth. I realize that this might not be the conventinal view, but who wouldn't want to be able to escape troubles of this life by travelling through time to better, more peacefull days? I was suprised that this book made me think (given it's weird events and almmost sci-fi feel, which is usualy not my thing) and that's really all that matters. I might forget the story one day, but this book's alternative views on war, life and death will definitelly stick with me.
B000002G9S|5.0|All Right (now) Free were my favourite band: Kossof has to be one of the best &quot;feel&quot; guitarists ever, and one who plays less notes than the new guys, but who says more in that one note than anyone........<br />Andy Fraser is one of the most under-rated bass players..... and Paul Rodgers is a &quot;singer's singer&quot;... so what more do you want??<br />Well, music that still stands where a lot has succumbed to the ravages of time. Okay, the lyrics are still 1970's (but some songs better than others) and for blues/rock affecionados, this is the real thing in a morass of pretenders.<br />If you haven't heard Free, start with this album, then do Free At Last. A  much better band than Bad Company, really, who were in it for the money (and actually made some), but Free are still one of the beacons in rock as far as I'm concerned.
B000063DFN|5.0|My introduction to Iron Maiden was their classic 1982 masterpiece NUMBER OF THE BEAST.  That album was fast, hard, and relentless, but also melodic and intelligent, unlike a lot of other metal bands at the time.  I loved every moment of it, but not even NOTB could prepare for what I was about to hear on the band's other masterpiece - 1984's POWERSLAVE.  The raw energy and power of NOTB and the band's first two albums are still present, but POWERSLAVE is much more than a rock-your-socks off metal album.  This was the turning point in Iron Maiden's career.<br />The band was getting more and more ambitious with each successive release.  The epic arrangements and complex song structures that were merely hinted at on the 1983 predecessor PIECE OF MIND have blown up tenfold on POWERSLAVE.  Lyrically, Steve Harris has matured, writing deep lyrics that are more mystical and philosophical than on previous songs.  Bruce Dickinson also contributes some great lyrics on here, and his voice soars like never before over the sea of blazing riffs and Nicko McBrain's non-stop drumming.<br />And did I mention the riffs?  Dave Murray and Adrian Smith certainly know what they're doing on this record.  All of their riffs rock hard, crunch hard, harmonize with each other, and just get down -- the way riffs should always sound.<br />I love every song on here, but my favorites would have to be the raging opener &quot;Aces High&quot; (great solo by Murray), the intensely melodic and patriotic instrumental &quot;Losfer Words (Big 'Orra),&quot; the furiously catchy &quot;Back in the Village,&quot; the Egyptian-flavored title track (I love that chorus!), and the well-crafted 13-minute closer &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner.&quot;  Harris' moody bassline really shines on the last song.<br />Now, I don't know if this is Maiden's true masterpiece yet since I hear all of their albums in the '80s are just as good, maybe even better, but POWERSLAVE is truly a milestone in the world of heavy metal.
B000068QY7|5.0|Why is it that whenever Oasis releases an album, the Beatles analogy come up?? Honestly, the Beatles were great but not many people of our generation know the songs in and out. Bands can sound alike but the Beatles (as a band) aren't writing new material today. Just listen to the music and ignore the labels!!! <BR>    This Oasis album is defintely in the top 3 (out of all 6) they have released. \\"Little by Little,\\" and,\\" Forces of Nature,\\" are great songs to put on repeat and listen to for awhile. \\"Hindu Times,\\" and, \\"Songbird,\\" are also some gems. There is only 10 songs on this but, the quality of them is much better than the last album they released. Overall, this album is a good one for hardcore Oasis fans to play until it breaks and newbies to ease into their music. If you like this one, try, \\"What's the story? (morning glory)\\" or \\"The Masterplan.\\"
B00005JLDW|5.0|You have seen the previews Quinn a British kid awakens an ancient dragon who then proceeds to touch the world. There is a brief interlude(and one of the better explations for current conditions of the movie in the entire history of the genre). We then find Christian Bale in charge of a group of survivors(along with a pitiful supplly of food and ammo. <br />Along comes Matthew M ready to lead his troops into his liviing demonstration of Custer's Last Stand. Armed with glittering weapons (and bulging eyes) he sets out to win the hearts and minds of the people. <br />So as for the movie itself you ask? <br />Very good but they ruined it with the ending.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|A great Echo and the Bunnymen tune is featured in the beginning of the film, har-har-har. This is a very engrossing film, well worth the 90 minutes or so of your life. Donnie Darko is a mixture of social commentary, satire, science fiction type themes and dark drama; but it is all mixed together in a very well paced and clever manner. The acting is very good as well, even Drew Barrymore's performance as the weird teacher (now THAT is truly amazing). A truly DIFFERENT but great film.
185984054X|5.0|Really can't add anything that hasn't already been said.  Of course die-hard Catholics are going to be apoplectic over this book, as they should be; if one lives their lives in supersticious nonsense they're more than likely to be a bit upset when someone with commonsense comes along and slays one of their idols.<br /><br />Hitchens uses a great dose of pragmatism along with myriad examples to make his case.  His documentation of Teresa's glad-handing support for Charles Keating was nothing short of fantastic and enthralling.  The book contains a copy of the actual letter the prosecuting DA sent to Teresa urging her to refund Keating's donations to the victims and to rethink her support for the charlatan (the twice swindled victims are still waiting for a refund).<br /><br />The info about her courting the Duvalier criminal aristocracy of Haiti is also very interesting.  He also broaches the topic of how Teresa and the Catholic hierarchy urged that woman who were raped and became pregnant during the Yugoslav conflict should refrain from aborting the fertilized egg and force themselves to give birth.  Lastly, the portion of the book dealing with the \\"Kodak/Teresa miracle\\" was hilarious!<br /><br />Ignore the negative reviews and enter into the world of clear thinking rationality by reading this book.  He describes Teresa's mission and work as basically a cult of suffering and dying; a bitter truth that takes a lot of guts to say even though it's so accurate.  In the tradition of Bertrand Russell and agnostic rationalists everywhere, Hitchens delivers a bombshell.<br /><br />The title is quite enjoyable as well.
B000068QY7|3.0|I have only listened to this CD about 3 times through, so i assume I will like it more once i listen to it again and again...i will do a song by song review:<br />The Hindu Times: I think everyone has heard this, the 1st release and i must say it hasn't had the same effect on me since i first heard it, good song though..<br />Force Of Nature: A good strong song, at first i didnt think much of it but its a good overall song.<br />Hung in a bad place: class song, its got everything, one of the best off the CD, quite catchy<br />Stop crying your heart out: I will always love this song, I promise! everyone has heard it, it's emotional and might get u crying, brilliant beautiful song.<br />Songbird: Not bad actually for an acoustic 2:07 song! They could of done worse, the verses are good and it slowly brings you into the chorus, good song.<br />Little by Little: This is the best song along side Stop Crying Your Heart Out..the chorus is amazin, and i must say i much prefer Noel's voice..catchy song that i have listened to loads, it has to be the next release! though the radio would spoil it:(<br />A Quick Peep: wot do i say? a 1 minute instrumental, nothing special at all.<br />All In The Mind: nothing special here, a bit boring..i've heard worse though. I haven't skipped it yet, so it can't be that bad.<br />She is Love: A nice acoustic song, with good verse and chorus, possibly a later release. <br />Born on a different cloud: I luv this song, another fave of mine! It's beautiful, Quite freaky actually, i think this is 1 of those sort of songs u get on the end of an album that will never be released..it's too special to release, great song.<br />Better Man: Meh, i've heard better..not the best way to end of an average album...This song gets straight into it right at teh beginning which is pretty cool..<br />to end it off i will say this is an average album. tehy have released better, but really it's not [that bad]! it would better if there was another 1 or 2 more songson it, oh well, i will keep listening to this and will change my review if i feel things will change..:)
B000051YD6|5.0|The Emperor Concerto probably is supposed to be the main attraction on this CD, and the performance of it presenteed here is laudable. But for me the lovely 4th is the most beautiful of the Beethoven Piano Concertos and this performance by Claudio Arrau and Sir Colin Davis is special. It is, quite simply, the most beautiful performance of this uniquely lyrical concerto that I have ever heard. Yes, the tempos are somewhat slower than usual, but this allows Arrau and Davis to bring out all the subtle glories of this very special masterpiece. There are many fine performances of the exhuberant Emperor Concerto available but few pianists and conductors -- even among the most famous -- seem capable of understanding and presenting the gentler beauties contained in the 4th concerto. Arrau and Davis have captured and presented these exquisite beauties better than any other pianist and conductor. If you love the gentler side of Beethoven -- or just great piano music -- I beg you to get this CD and listen to it with open ears. You will be amply rewarded.
0380820846|2.0|Julia Quinn is one of my favorite authors, and I was anxiously awaiting this book.  Unfortunately Romancing Mister Bridgerton was truly disappointing.  Colin and Penelope's story could have been so much better, but it was trite and forced.  One had to wonder what these characters saw in each other.  Not that they were unlikable, but they were an unlikely couple.  They lacked chemistry, the story lacked conflict - simply put, the book lacked the creativity and humor of Ms. Quinn's previous novels.
B00003CXV4|5.0|If you are a romantic at heart you will probably love this very special movie. However, if you not a romantic, don't bother to see it -- you'll probably dismiss it as hopeless drivel as several reviwers have. This is probably a so-called \\"chic flick,\\" but this guy fell in love with it. I saw it on cable TV and immediately bought the DVD. Keanu Reeves plays a hard-driven workaholic adman without a life outside of his work. Charlize Theron plays a beautiful free spirit who takes him into her life for one month (November) and slowly changes the way he sees the world -- including the very important differences between sex and love and between taking and giving. As I said at the beginning of this review, whether you will enjoy the truths and beauties of this film will depend on your view of life. If you haven't yet learned the lessons learned by Reeves' character in his special month with Theron's, this movie -- compelling as it is -- probably isn't long enough to change your view of life. But it's still a wonderful movie.

B00005QATY|5.0|This is a great movie!  It is very, very, hilarious!  They've done a great job recreating the story of Homer's &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. It's full of old-time folk music and laughs!
B000002J6F|5.0|There are plenty of reviews already out there.....BUY THIS CD TOMORROW.
6305537550|5.0|Everyone knows the plot by now (and if you don't, you can pick it up from many of the reviews), so I won't go there. I watch this film at least once a year, right around Halloween, naturally. It's amazing that a film made on such a shoestring is still a classic today, but that goes to show you that it's not always about special effects and such. The suspense reaches Hitchcockian levels, and the movie is one of the scariest out there without lots of goop and gore. Watch this movie---but not at night, and definietly not alone!
B00005JKED|4.0|\\"Training Day\\" is unflinchingly bleak yet so much more morally realistic than other cop dramas.  But for one ridiculous coincidence which allows Jake (Ethan Hawke) to miraculously avoid having his brain sprayed all over a bathtub, this is an exceptionally fine film.  The tension is agonizing, the performances superb, and the script has something important to say.  Denzel Washington is magnificent as always, though I'm not sure his performance was Oscar-worthy.  But no matter.  He surely deserved one for \\"The Hurricane\\" in 2000 but lost out to man-of-the-moment Spacey in \\"American Beauty\\": another occasion when a brilliant actor got an Oscar he deserved, but probably not for that performance.
B000001EAQ|5.0|this is hands down the best u2 album yet. the only problem with it was that it came out way before its time which just goes to show how good of a band u2 is. its a must buy for everyone.
B00005JLDW|1.0|A promising premise goes bad.  Plot points that go no where, accents so thick and unreal that the dialogue is hard to follow and Matthew McConaughey, well he is constantly on the verge of tears and hysteria.  One the way home, my partner insisted that my movie selection priviledges have been suspended for 30 days.  Absolutely pass on this one.  The special effects are great, but not enough to carry this mess of a movie.  Wait till its a discount rental which should be very, very soon.
B0000028RR|3.0|This is a strong debut. <br />Being that i got into Rage after the release of The battle of LA, i wasnt forced to JUST listen to this.<br />Dont misunderstand me, i like this CD, but Its definetly not as strong as the battle of LA, and its now where near Evil Empire's level. <br />This cd, just FEELS different for some reason. Its more raw than their later work which appeals to some but it may turn off others. <br />The best songs on this cd are:<BR>Killing in the name of(a rage classic), Take the power back (which has an almost funk bass element that isnt present on any other cd), Wake up , and Township rebellion. <br />The others are merely ok. <br />I wouldnt reccomend this CD to anyone just getting into rage. Id go with The Battle of LA, then Evil mpire then this CD(Renegade can be purchased at any time).
0811826848|4.0|Its a great book, with all the pictures and stuff, but make sure you have a oversized shelf in your book shelf if you buy it.:)
B000006OS2|1.0|good times has ruined this movie, cropped so bad it's not worth buying. the vhs is much better. hope to see the real dvd version out soon. trust me, i really love this movie. i bought it and couldn't sit through it.
B00005JL3A|2.0|I have to say that Resident Evil was a worth-while movie. However, considering it was supposed to based on the first installment of the seris confused me. The movie and the game had some small similarities in their story lines, but all-and-all they were practicly different adventures altogether. I was dissapointed in the fact that not all the chacaters and monsters of the video game were present in the movie. And, most of all, that many, many key elements were cut or changed. But in spite of all that, the movie was really good. Nasty but good.
B000002OX7|4.0|WHO'S NEXT is a a terrific album, from the opening sweep of the synthsiser in &quot;Baba O'Reilly,&quot; through the pummeling of &quot;Bargain&quot; and John &quot;Ox&quot; Entwistle's &quot;My Wife,&quot; the granduer of &quot;The Song Is Over&quot; and, of course, the &quot;YEEAAARRGGGHHH&quot; of &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again.&quot; Everything works; the band is tight, the songs are great and Pete Townshend's ambitions hadn't gotten the better of him at this point in the band's history.<br />I'm not sure that in this particular case the &quot;bonus tracks&quot; that are on here are such a good idea, because the original album had such a perfect symmetry of it's own from start to finish that &quot;extra&quot; seems like &quot;too much.&quot; Not to say that what's added isn't good, maybe just that it should've had a seperate context. Even so, it's still a trip to hear the original versions of &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; and &quot;Pure and Easy&quot; and, anyway, there's the main body of the original album as well and that's what it's about, mate!

B000000W5F|5.0|..Though cobbled together from previous years and given a uniformed sheen, Tattoo You seems to have a theme relating to the assassination of John Lennon, which took place just prior to the record's release.<br />The title implies a farewell. Heaven, Tops (&quot;toppermost of the poppermost&quot; Lennon always proclaimed). Waiting on a Friend, Long Black Limosine (&quot;you were in white&quot;) Lil' T and A and Slave could be slight digs at the Yoko relationship. Neighbors (Jagger lived near the Dakota at the time)  No Use In Crying, even Start Me Up has the Stones declaring fearlessly &quot;I'll never stop&quot;<br />Tattoo You John.
B00005JKL8|5.0|This was a great movie! Great cinamatography, great casting, great acting, great graphics, great plotline, great story. Every few seconds I was telling my boyfriend (who hadn't seen it) &quot;Oh this is the best part!&quot; It is so well done with the stop action and the thing with the statue in the beginning is so cool. I loved this movie...it freaked me out and made me go &quot;YEA!&quot; I recommend this movie to anyone! And girls, if your a chick flick person, watch it anyway, because you'll say &quot;I'm just watching it for him&quot; but in the end you'll be all &quot;that was awesome!&quot; Behind Enemy Lines is one of my all time favorites.
6303402348|5.0|This is one movie that deserved all the acclaim it got. Forrest Gump is one of the most original ideas for a movie ever created. It follows the unbelievable life of Forrest Gump and the humorous and heartbreaking journeys that he endures in war, love, and life. Hanks is wonderful as the slow, but innocent Forrest and there are so many great and powerful moments in this movie. I think it is so enduring because it is about the human experience, and we, as an audience, feel for Forrest as he must learn life and the problems life presents. It is an experience that we all must go through, and I recommend this movie to anyone.
B00005R2M3|1.0|I am not saying anything but... &quot;Shakira, get thee to the laundry and wash, not only your clothes, but your act.&quot; Your other two albums were smash hits, but this one is your biggest flaw. Whoever would sing to a horse? Get a life, Shakira!
B00000DFSK|5.0|Some bands have a great sound, others have terrific lyrics, and both kinds are good, but only when a marriage of the two happens do you get a great (truly great) band.  U2 is one of these.  What more can one say?  The powerful, fresh lyrics combined with Bono's emotional voice, the Edge's shimmering guitar work, and Larry Mullen and Adam Clayton's bass and percussion laying down a smooth track create not only atmosphere, but meaning.  The perfect album from the (nearly) perfect band.
0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold has written a breathtaking story and unfolds the pages through the words of a dead girl who reveals her life and how she died.<br />The writing is at once alive and fresh. If you think that the voice of a dead girl as a narrator sounds a bit hokey and unbelievable you are just like I was before I started reading. From the outset, though, I was I was captivated.  This is great stuff -- the story and Sebold's style are superb. Wow.

6305327084|4.0|A terrific ensemble cast brings this film to life, which focuses on the difficulties some face in making that final, \\"mental\\" leap from adolescence to adulthood, and spend way too many years trying to sort it all out.  As one of the characters so tellingly puts it at one point, \\"I'm not anywhere close to being the man I thought I'd be--\\" and the denial, that failure to accept the fact that time stands still for no man, and the inability to choose which path to take when you hit that inevitable fork in the road, forms the basis for director Ted Demme's examination of how human nature affects the process of maturating, in \\"Beautiful Girls,\\" a drama featuring Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon and a young Natalie Portman.<br />Willie Conway (Hutton) is back home in the Midwest for his high school reunion, but more than that, to try and make some decisions about his future.  He finds that nothing much has changed-- the town, or his old friends, most of whom seem to be exerting more time and energy attempting to cling to what was, rather than moving on with their lives.  Tommy Rowland (Dillon), for instance, the high school \\"hero,\\" as it were, now drives a snowplow; for all intents and purposes, his life \\"peaked\\" in high school, and he can't seem to get past it.  Then there's Paul (Michael Rapaport), who just doesn't seem to want to grow up; after a seven year relationship with Jan (Martha Plimpton), he refuses to make that final commitment-- after all, \\"What's the rush?\\"<br />All of which does nothing to help Willie with his own dilemma; the only words of wisdom he gets from anyone, in fact, come from the precocious thirteen-year-old, Marty (Natalie Portman), who lives next door.  But in a couple of days, Tracy (Annabeth Gish), the girl Willie \\"thinks\\" he wants to marry, is due to arrive from Chicago, so it's time to move beyond the crossroads; for Willie, it's decision time.<br />Demme delivers a story that just about everyone in the audience is going to connect with on somelevel, because everyone's gone through (or will go through) these kinds of things at one time or another.  Who hasn't experienced, if only for a moment, that sense of either wanting to stay as they are or going back to what they were, when life was better, or at least simpler.  Or more fun.  Working from a screenplay by Scott Rosenberg, Demme examines the relationships between this eclectic group of individuals in a way that offers some insights into human nature that will no doubt elicit some reflection on the part of the viewer.  It all points up that, no matter what it may look like on the surface, underneath it all we're not so different from one another; we all share that common bond of learning life's lessons one day at a time, albeit in our own particular way, which corresponds to who we are as individuals.  And Demme succeeds in telling his story with warmth and humor; by tapping into the humanity at the heart of it all.<br />The story may focus on Willie, but the film is a true ensemble piece, realized as it is through the sum of it's many and varied parts.  It's a talented cast of actors bringing a unique bunch of characters to life that makes this film what it is, beginning with Hutton, who anchors it with his solid portrayal of Willie, a challenging role in that Willie has to be an average guy who is unique in his own right.  The same can be said of Dillon's Tommy, in whom traces of Dallas Winston from \\"The Outsiders\\" can be found; Tommy is, perhaps, just Dallas a few years later.<br />Mira Sorvino gives a memorable performance by creating the most sympathetic character in the film, Tommy's girlfriend, Sharon.  This is the girl who was never going to be prom queen, and who up until now has lacked the self-confidence necessary to create a positive environment for herself.  Lauren Holly, meanwhile, succeeds with her portrayal of Darian Smalls, the absolute opposite of Sharon, a young woman who is probably too positive for her own good and who lives the life of a perpetual prom queen, an individual who-- as another character succinctly puts it-- was \\"Mean as a snake,\\" back in the day.  Good performances that add a balanced perspective to the film.<br />There are two performances here that really steal the show, however.  The first being that of Michael Rapaport, who as Paul so completely and convincingly captures the very essence of an average Joe with not too much on the ball, no prospects for the future to speak of, but who is, at heart, a good guy.  There's humor and pathos in his portrayal, which personifies that particular state of being the film is seeking to depict.  Excellent work by Rapaport, and decidedly one of the strengths of the film.<br />The most memorable performance of all, however, is turned in by Natalie Portman, who at fifteen is playing the thirteen-year-old Marty, the girl mature and wise beyond her years (\\"I'm an old soul,\\" as she puts it), with whom Willie forms a kind of bond as she, in her own way, helps him to sort out his feelings and find his focus.  Portman's performance here-- some three years before she would forever become Padme Amidala-- exhibits that spark and charismatic screen presence that has served her so well since, in films like \\"Anywhere But Here,\\" and \\"Where the Heart Is.\\"  She has for some time been, and continues to be, one of the finest and most promising young actors in the business.<br />The cast also includes Noah Emmerich (Mo), Rosie O'Donnell (Gina), Max Perlich (Kev), Uma Thurman (Andrea), Anne Bobby (Sarah) and Pruitt Taylor Vince (Stanley), all of whom help to make \\"Beautiful Girls\\" a memorable and satisfying cinematic experience.  And that's the magic of the movies.
B00005GL0U|5.0|awesome and incredible. ....<br />I do love this album. I also fear that some of its subtle charm is lost on CD. This was an album with very clearly defined \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" sides, a deliniation that is lost on compact disc.<br />It is the \\"B\\" side that defines this album for me. Sure, the \\"A\\" side sets a surrealistic tone, with \\"Maxwell\\" combining a silly sounding ditty with truely disturbing lyrics, but...<br />It is the awesome 12-song-1-song string on the \\"B\\" side that has always [drawn] me in.<br />Beginning with \\"I want you (She's So Heavy)\\" and rolling through \\"Her Majesty\\" 11 tracks later, the \\"B\\" sides melts through a charming series a genre-mocking half songs that blend into a sort of mini opera.<br />It is almost sacreligious to listen to any of these cuts independently, as they all play a role in the song immediately preceding and following them. It's quite fabulous.<br />...this is a great one.
B000002H2H|5.0|First off this album is an excellent addition to your library of music. Metallica fan or not you will enjoy this album simply because of the quality of the songs. Every song is well crafted and very unique. There are slow songs like the classic \\"Fade to Black\\" and of course there are the heavy, fast-paced songs like \\"Creeping Death\\". When you listen to this album you will appreciate the time and effort that was put into it. I shouldn't have to say much more about this wonderful piece of music because there is nothing I can say that will make you like it. You are just going to have to give this album a chance and see if YOU like it. But trust me if you are a fan of heavy metal you will most likely enjoy it.
6304500831|5.0|This is one of Disney's best. The story is not too dark - like I think that Bambi or Dumbo are. It has great music and a nice story with enough excitement to keep the kids riveted. Additionally, it provides nostalgia for parents and grandparents who enjoyed the movie the first time around.
B00002E233|5.0|I know that it was kind of corny, but what do you expect, it's not reality! I loved this movie, I've watched it 3 times and I'm planning on buying it! Alot of my friends thought it was a bit too much, I just loved it!! Most movies about human-eating animals are pretty silly, but this one was awesome and very entertaining!
0446608955|5.0|I recently purchased the paperback addition of A Walk to Remember. It is the best book I have ever read. I saw the movie and thought it was great also. I recommend this book to EVERYONE!<BR>It is a very sweet book.
B000066AXD|5.0|This by far is the best movie I have ever seen! It had me hooked until about half-way through, then I suddenly clued in! I thought the story was really good, all the actors (especially hottie Russell Crowe) were awesome!! Definately a MUST see!
B000001DVD|5.0|High n Dry is without a doubt, Def Leppard's best and last great album. Steve Clark is absolutely phenomenal! Not only did he have the emotion and technical skills to write brilliant songs,, his soloing is unsurpassed!!! Great examples are \\"Let it Go\\", \\"Mirror, Mirror\\", Lady Strange\\", and of course, the hilight of the album, Switch 625. For those who love great lead guitar playing, this one has it all.. Also,the \\"On through the Night\\" album is incredible. Pete Willis and Steve clark were the perfect twin guitar team.<BR>It's too bad that Phil Collen and Vivian Campbell couldn't fill their shoes.
B00005R87Q|5.0|I loved this movie! I loved the story, all the actors, everything about it! I've watched this movie at least 5 times, and it never gets boring! Thumbs up!!!!
B000003CKH|5.0|I'm not familiar with cake's other material, but I think that most people would see where I'm coming from if I called Fashion Nugget both a wonderfully entertaining album and a great piece of pop art.<br />Each member of the band is very conscious of the sounds they make and where they fit in to the whole.  The singer, like Frank Sinatra and many other white jazz singers, has cultivated a persona that comes through on every track and does a wonderful job of delivering the lyrics, which are whymsical and very clever.  The guitarist, the bassist, the trumpet player, the keyboardist and the drummer are all very creative and original sounding and are very careful to both play stuff that is tasteful and stay out of each other's way.<br />The band is able to put out this modern, sort of suburban-hipster sound, and at the same refrence popular music of the 50's.  On top of everything else, the cd is fairly well produced.  It's very very inspired and inspiring, great great music.<br />I'm a musician myself, and I mostly listen to jazz, but this is a cd that I always keep around.
0316666343|5.0|Having read several reviews about the subject of this book, it was a bit difficult for me to decide to actually sit down and read it. But, it kept pulling at me, and, after hearing the author talk about writing the book, I knew I would have to read it. Once, I finally did open it, I gulped it down in one sitting.  Like many other readers, I was sorry to see it end, but, unable to slow down.  I hoped for peace for Suzie's family, and, justice to catch up with Mr. Harvey.  Ms Sebold reminds me that, very often, life deals to us in ways we never would have expected or wanted, but, she reminds me so gently that I am left shaking my head saying, 'That's right, that's how things are here.' <BR>I highly recommend this book, and, look forward to anything else Ms Sebold offers in the future.
1558216847|5.0|I don't read much fiction any more.  I don't need to.  True stories are much better.   And the heroes are real mentors for me.  Slavomir Rawicz is one of my heroes.<br />He endured brutal torture in a Soviet Prison Camp, Freezing weather in Siberia, Summer heat in the Gobi Desert, Winter in the Himalayas, and many experiences of survival by sheer guts.<br />My kids ask me to tell them a bedtime story sometimes.  My stories of Rawicz's survival has been one of their favorites.<br />--George Stancliffe
B00005JLDW|4.0|IN a day when a lot of movies are affects extravaganzas with a weak story tagged on to justify the effects, Reign of Fire was an enjoyable change of pace.  These folks have a fun story to tell, interesting characters you care about and plenty of action to satisfy my male appetite for adventure and destruction.  If you're looking for wall to wall battle scenes, you won't find it here.  I thought they struck a great balance between character development, a fun story and great action.  JUST what I like.<br />If the premise of a fantasy movie has to be scientifically plausible for a movie to be satisfying for you ... this might now work.  But when a movie premise involves dragons, all I'm looking for is a reasonable effort to explain there presence ... and not only does ROF deliver that, but I thought the notion they came up with was original and fun.<br />The characters were surprisingly compelling ... I really found myself caring about what happened to them.  The fact that they learn to work together and grow from their experiences is more than I normally expect from a high energy action adventure flick.<br />I'll see it again.
B00005QDW1|1.0|I was never a big No Doubt fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed Tragic Kingdom. ... after listening [to this album], I have dtermined this cd a piece of junk. There are fans out there that will follow No Doubt down whatever path they take ... But let's face it, this cd is ...
B00005YW4H|5.0|You will be impressed by this an amazingly talented young singer. She sings like a master with her jazzy, bluezzy, saultry and sexy voice.  She sings with such passion.  I never heard such wonderful and delightful voice like Nora Jones.  Buy her CD now.  You won't regret it!  You'll be hooked......
B000067CPX|5.0|Fifty percent of RHCP fans like their old school funk stuff (Freaky Styly, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan) better than the new stuff.The other fifty percent like the new stuff (One Hot Minute,<BR>Californication)better. I like their new stuff better because it is much better. I will admit One Hot Minute lacked alot but then it didn't have John Frusciante. The fact is By The Way is their best all around. ... By The Way is just sooooooo good...If you've ever been interested in RHCP then buy this album soon. And if you are fifty percent old schooler and fifty percent new schooler, get Blood Sugar Sex Magik, their coolest and funkiest album.
B00003CXFV|5.0|First of all, the movie is great. With Albert Finney recieving an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actor as well as Steven Soderbergh for direction, one can already sense that this is a great film. But to top it all off, &quot;America's Sweetheart&quot;, and my personal favorite, Julia Roberts finally takes home an Oscar in a well-deserved performance. Obviously, the movie is well worth your time.<br />Nevertheless, what I would like to point out to all of you Julia fans out there, as well as anyone who thoughrougly enjoyed this film, is that the DVD is jam packed with bonus stuff that will keep you occupied for nearly as long as the movie will! The DVD contains an informative and entertaining &quot;Making Of&quot; featurette, as well as clips featuring the REAL Erin Brockovich and the REAL Ed Masry sharing their story through their own eyes. <br />THE BEST PART, however, is yet to come! The DELETED SCENES are worth whatever you pay for the DVD. Even if you don't own a DVD player, go visit a friend who has one and pop it in and play the deleted scenes!! There is almost an hour of footage that was cut from the first original draft of the film, including a dramatic sub-plot that actually happend to the REAL Erin Brockovich...<BR>...THEN, watch the deleted scenes again with Soderbergh's comments playing in the background. <br />It's a wonderful experience and a wonderful movie well worth the money for the DVD.
B0000640SA|5.0|Memento is one of the best films I have ever seen. Memento boldly tests Hollywood filmmaking and logic. If you want to see a good movie see Memento. Christopher Nolan hands down, is the best new filmmaker. If you like Memento then you'll also like his latest movie Insomnia. Guy Pearce does a fantastic job as Leonard Shelby. Carrie-Anne Moss also does a great job as the snotty Natilie. And Joe Pantoliano does a good job as the back-stabbing Teddy(or so you think . . .)<br />This film is absolutly confusing, but in a good way. You have to watch it about 5 or 6 times to really solve the mystery. You have to consider everything. I mean EVERYTHING! If you happen to have the May 22, 2001 issue of Entertainment Weekly then read the article on Memento, AFTER the movie. It helps you consider a lot of things you probably will miss like I did. I have yet to buy the movie but it looks like a keeper! <br />Heres a little about the storyline of the film:<BR>First off be aware the film goes backwards which is pretty cool. Its put together perfectly. The film is about a man whos wife is rapped and murdered and when he tries to interfere he gets knocked-out. When he awakes he is unable to make new memories, so all he has left is everything that happened before the murder and he is destined to find the man who killed his wife.<br />Thats just the basics and I'm not going to give away anymore. see this movie, but beware becuase you are in fun an awesome treat! Thanks
B00005QIPH|3.0|These guys have it all.  They have genuine rock attitude ala Lou Reed.  They look cool.  They are a long overdue backlash to the boy band [...junk] that's been crowding the airwaves.  They are like some unrehearsed garage band that somehow made its way onto the radio and it is a blast of fresh, unproduced, rock and roll air.<br />But they are missing one crucial element: Talent.  Maybe they'll find some along the way, but for now their songs are terrible, they can't play their instruments, and as if that weren't bad enough, they are poorly recorded.<br />Oh well, at least it isn't Britney Spears.  If they represent the future of Rock and Roll, I, for one, say it's a welcome change.
B000066C1N|5.0|I haven't seen the movie yet, but I really want to.  The music is a masterpiece in itself.  Again, Hans Zimmer grabs the listener's attention with a unique and passionate main theme.  Fans of Zimmer will appreciate his return to more electronic modes expression.  You'll hear echoes of  previous works such as &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, &quot;The Rock,&quot;  &quot;Point of No Return,&quot; and others.  In Track 10 (Run Free), there is about 6 whole minutes of &quot;running free.&quot;  You will feel as if you are actually there--flying across the plains--free as can be.  Track 11 (Homeland) is so grand.  Zimmer paints pictures with his melodies.  I can see images of nature when I hear it.   And, hey, I haven't even seen the movie! Again, just to show you how enchanting this CD truly is.<br />I find this CD incredibly uplifting, soothing, and energetic.  It makes me feel optimistic and hopeful.  Bryan Adams' performance in Track 1 &quot;I will always return&quot; is food for the soul.  It's rather neat to hear Zimmer's grand theme in the background as Bryan sings from the heart.  Bryan's other songs are equally inspiring, fun, comforting, if not reflective.  Track 5's Brother under the Sun choked me up a few times.<br />Those who believe in dreams, and those who would like to de-stress by travelling to another world...this CD is a good choice.  There are no &quot;scary&quot; heavy music to frighten you (if you listen to it late at night) and the themes are predictable, safe, and very therapeutic. Believe me, you'll be humming the tunes after your 1st-3rd listen!
B00005JLDW|5.0|It was so good! It was such a change for Matthew McConaughey, but he was absolutely perfect for the role. As soon as the movie finished, my freind and I were thinking the same thing: We can't wait 'til this comes out on DVD! I would definitely recommend this movie! Go see it! The entire cast rocks, especially McConaughey!
B00005JKBC|1.0|It is a good thing that  this movie is too absurd to be taken seriously; otherwise it would be frightening. Imagine for yourself the consequences of a Chinese invasion of a prison in say, LA. Redford's character is willing to risk WWIII for his dumb friend,<BR>who does such nonsense as giving bubble gum to a Chinese prisoner. I would rate this movie \\"black hole\\" instead of one star but unfortunately the category does not exist. I respect Robert Redford's talents but this one is a turkey. No, more than that: it is a frightening example of Hollywood's mindless, even immoral, choices of plots. Hollywood has a responsibility to foster and encourage peace and brotherhood in our sad world.This sort of movie encourages the wrong sort of thinking. Yes, I am aware of the politically correct gesture offered in the kiss \\"Gladys\\" (Redford's character's black secretary) received in the movie and the questioning of collateral damage in the Beirut assasination. These seem to me to be mere gestures, obligatory additions with no weight. The main actions rests on the \\"cowboy-style\\" rescue which I believe encourages the wrong type of thinking. The movie industry has indeed tried  in the last few decades to give the public some good messages in their products such as tolerance of other races, religions and kindness and more. Several movies in recent years give us hope and encourage those qualities and attitudes that are salutary for the human race. This movie, in spite of the inclusion of gestures of political correctness, is not one.
B000068QY7|4.0|&quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; is one of those albums that really didn't live up to my expectations, it far exceeded them.  When I first learned that new band members Gem Archer and Andy Bell would be contributing songs to the album, I thought that this would signal the loss of the band's classic sound.  Then, when I heard that Liam Gallagher, whose &quot;Little James&quot; is unquestionably the worst Oasis song ever recorded, would be writing three songs for the album, I prepared myself for the worst.  Somewhere along the way, however, the band did seem to establish a sense of chemistry that resulted in an uplifting, melodic album that somehow manages to capture the classic sound of the band's first two albums.<br />Oasis have always tried to write songs with a positive, &quot;life isn't as bad as it seems&quot; message, and nowhere is that message more clear than on this album.  The lyrics speak for themselves.  The album's opening track, &quot;The Hindu Times&quot;, opens with the line &quot;I get up when I'm down, I can't swim but my soul won't drown.&quot;  In &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot;, the album's one and only &quot;power ballad&quot;, Liam sings, &quot;Take what you need and be on your way, and stop crying your heart out.&quot;  Filled with a string section, a haunting piano melody, and an absolutely blistering vocal performance from Liam, this song is a classic.<br />The album combines a nice mix of pure rock tracks like Gem Archer's &quot;Hung In A Bad Place&quot; and Liam's &quot;Better Man&quot; with melodic, acoustic ditties like Liam's &quot;Songbird&quot; and brother Noel's &quot;She Is Love&quot;.  It also contains those classic Oasis mid-tempo numbers like Noel's &quot;(Probably) All In The Mind&quot; and &quot;Force Of Nature&quot;.  Then there's Noel's &quot;Little By Little&quot;, a song with some poignant lyrics and an anthemic chorus.  Lines like &quot;True perfection has to be imperfect&quot; clearly show Noel's growth as a songwriter.  <br />I must admit, however, that I was most pleasantly surprised by Liam's &quot;Born On A Different Cloud&quot;.  When I first heard it I couldn't beleive it was written by the same guy who wrote &quot;Little James&quot;.  Superb lyrics combined with several melodic shifts and a great vocal performance make this track an album highlight.  The overall sound of the song does have a heavy Beatles influence to it, but, then again, most people say that about all Oasis songs.<br />This album is light years beyond the band's last two LP's, which were grossly overproduced and lacked those classic Oasis melodies that fans have come to love and expect from the band.  Nevertheless, it could've been improved by adding Andy Bell's &quot;Thank You For The Good Times&quot; instead of his minute and a half long instrumental &quot;A Quick Peep&quot;.  That track is a little too quick for me.  Additionally, the 5 minute hidden instrumental track at the end of the album is a nuisance to get to, since you have to forward some 33 minutes into track 11 before you can find it.  However, this is still a top notch album.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is not quite as good as &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; or &quot;(What's The Story) Morning Glory?&quot;.  Those albums were innovative, cutting edge albums back in the mid 90's.  They brought forth a band with a truly unique sound and songs that will someday be considered classics.  Can Oasis ever top those two albums?  Probably not, but &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; is certainly a step in the right direction.
B000067CPX|5.0|I had a smile on my face the whole time I heard it through the first time, and that smile hasn't gone away since.  It's great to see these guys following their muses, instead of retreading the same old ground.  Artistic growth is so hard to come by in rock music, that this album hits like a breath of fresh air.  First off, those harmonies are dynamite and give their songs a new level of style.  The choice keyboard bits and Flea's trumpet solo on \\"Tear\\" also broaden the pallette.  Each song here has a lyric or musical piece that will catch your ear, much like \\"Pet Sounds,\\" an obvious inspiration.  The album transports you to another place, like all the best music does.  If you aren't totally moved by \\"The Zephyr Song,\\" you must check your pulse, cuz you don't have one.  Final kudos to Rick Rubin for producing yet another masterpiece (he deserves some kind of Producer's Hall of Fame award).  Far and away the most creative music you will hear this year!!!
B00005MP58|5.0|I loved this book, I loved this story!!!  This adaption really brings the characters alive, and the sexual tension between Darcy and Elizabeth greatly depicted and very exciting.  If nothing else, Colin Firth is the most irresistable man in the whole world as the character of Mr. Darcy, and the film could very well be firmly carried by his performance alone.  I was sad when this movie ended, but glad I was able to watch such a fun and fantastic version over and over again.
B000055XMF|4.0|This release of Quadrophenia is very good, but doesn't quite reach the superb mark.  Dramatically improved from the VHS release of many moons ago, the DVD release recaptures some of the sound and fury that I recall when I first saw the movie upon its release in 1979.  Visuals are improved and colors enhanced, though discretely, but there are still a number of visual flaws in the transfer (e.g., scratches in the film are preserved, as well as occasional film artifacts).  The sound reinforcement REALLY improved the experience, adding depth and presence to what was once a very tinny sounding film.<br />All of that being said, I believe Rhino did a wonderful job in the transfer, with the logical next step of preservation being a digital polishing (digitally removing scratches and artifacts, reregistering each frame, digital smoothing, etc.)  I'm not sure what else can be done to improve the audio track, as apparently it was pulled from the optical track on the film master (no separate mag tapes?)  Rhino is not Lucasfilm, and they don't have access to the $100MM post-processing digital labs of the latter, so I have no expecations of any digital magic on an indie cult classic like Quadrophenia.  Hey, this is a movie about '60's Brits, and it definitely retains that '60's feel!!  Isn't that what indie flicks are all about?<br />This is a wonderful remastered movie, with great extras, and it retains the same visceral punch as it did when first released.  A superb companion to the masterpiece album by The Who that is its namesake, I highly recommend it.  Four stars of five.<br />P.S.  If you've never seen Quadrophenia before, I strongly suggest listening to and studying the entire musical album two or three times prior to viewing the movie.  The emotion and fury unleashed by The Who in this album is virtually unmatched by any other album or artist at any time -- it truly is a modern musical masterpiece, and far surpasses Pete's original (and overhyped) opera, Tommy, in scope, range, and maturity.  Twenty five years later, and this album is still as incredible and vital as the day it was released.  Finally, go in peace, Ox, for we do miss you..., range, and maturity.  Twenty five years later, and this album is still as incredible and vital as the day it was released.  Finally, go in peace, Ox, for we do miss you...

0380817683|4.0|I've read all of this author's books, and this is by far my favourite.  Funny and sad, and nice and thick, so you can really get your teeth into it.  Definitely one of the better examples of &quot;chick lit&quot;, it probably won't change your life, but it will provide a nice distraction for a few hours.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Stop and think for a minute - 1977 - What were you doing in 1977? Petting your pet rock? Getting down with Tony Orlando & Dawn? Star Wars hit the world like a bolt from the blue. We were not prepared. Little did we know that 25 years later, the saga still continues.<br />What an original idea. To start a saga with episode IV. At the time, we didn't even question why - we were too blown away by the film. Even in the opening scene, we seem to be walking into the middle of a movie. Slowly, questions arose.<br />Through the decades, questions were answered, and more questions asked. But one answer stands certain - The continuing Star Wars story is the saga of our lives.<br />May we all continue to rebel against the evil empire.<br />And may the force be with you...
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Adults and children alike will love it!<BR>My favorite part on the DVD was in the special features. <BR>You have got to see the interview with the donkey!<BR>Hilarious
B000068FY0|5.0|This is truly classic rock at its very best.  Supertramp had totally out-done themselves with this, their first release.     A must for anyone who appreciates excellence!
B00003CXI1|1.0|While the HP books were outstanding, the movie had so much potential that it's very dissapointing to actually see the result.  The acting was bad, the effects poor, and the direction seemed to think this is a starwars movie.  The Quidditch scene was almost exactly the same as the Pod Racing scene on SW-EP1!<br />Waste of time, this is 2 hours of my life I want back!
B000065U1N|4.0|This movie, whether it was the artist's intention, is a perfect depiction as to why humanitarian efforts are a waste of lives and money (in that order). Many have disagreed with the somewhat disjointed idea of Laissez Faire international relations of American politics, but this movie reminds us of why we (as a nation) should keep our 'ideals' out of the violent arena of civil war among nations with their own agendas. Let the 'Will to Power' of nations (and people) run its course, and an equilibrium will soon be reached.
B0000640SA|1.0|I agreee with John from Houston - his review below - the battery of &quot;tests&quot; that Nolan has you complete before seeing anything on this disc is absurd. If you've got lot's of time on your hands and you love a puzzle, then the Limited Edition is for you. The packaging is cool and well done, but if you're like me, you got this edition because you love the movie so much you want more. Well, the &quot;more&quot; is so difficult to find, it isn't worth the effort.
B00005QEO1|5.0|After a decade of producing disappointing albums due to drug-abuse and problems within the band, Aerosmith finally cleaned up and returned to us with this classic!  Despite being produced during the late 80's, 'Pump' can easily join with it's successful older brothers done in the 70's: Get Your Wings, Toys In The Attic, Rocks, and Draw The Line.  <br />When Permanent Vacation was released, many were unsure about the path the band were taking.  Pump managed to establish the route with all the songs being single hits on radio or mtv.  A similar thing when Aerosmith's debut album was released.  The band didn't have a definate style or route.  'Get Your Wings' managed to establish that.  <br />The album begins with 'Young Lust'.  A sleazy anthem opening the show.  Next we have F.I.N.E.. An even sleazier song.  Probably one of the dirtiest songs i've ever listened to.  But that's Aerosmith for you, ain't it?  Next you get the classic 'Love In An Elevator' featuring an awesome two minute solo by Joe Perry.  The happy pace of the album continues with the radio hit, 'Monkey On My Back' which talks about Steve's life of drugs and hard living.  Soon the pace dies with a serious social commentary about child abuse with 'Janie's Got A Gun'.  The pace quickly picks up with 'The Otherside'.  'My Girl' and 'Don't Get Mad, Get Even' both stand out as great rock pieces with some awesome lyrics.  Next we get a darker song called 'Voodoo Medicine Man' with an eerie bass riff by Tom Hamilton and exotic background noises.  Finally, like many of Aerosmith's great albums, 'Pump' ends with a sweet ballad.  10/10 for all songs.<br />Though only ten tracks on this album, all of them are unique and excellent.  The CD lasts a little over 45 minutes which in my opinion, is a pretty good length.  Most albums that usually last over 60 minutes usually start to get tiresome.  <br />By the way...nice album cover, huh?  Suits the name of the album ;-).
0316666343|5.0|This is the most beautiful text I have yet to lay my hands on.  I drank this up in two evenings, and dreamt about it for longer.  I did not want it to end.  The innocence and frankness in the slaughtered girl's voice as she deals with the loveliness of her Heaven versus the sadness affecting her loved ones on Earth is compelling.  A new point of view of what happens after one dies, from both the dead and the living.  <BR>Touching - I laughed, cried, got angry and felt overwhelmed by the time I closed the back cover.

B00005JLDW|3.0|After weeks of seeing London burning in the midst of an all-out dragons vs. helicopters battle on the movie posters (and billboards, and official website), I was disappointed that this scene wasn't even in the movie--not even close.  To mention all the points that are wrong with this fantasy image borders on spoiling details of the film, so all I can say is it is a fun movie nonetheless, but don't expect what you might expect from the promotional artwork .
B00005JL3A|5.0|resident evil is all good its just about like the game i loved this movie and would say this is a must see
0811826848|5.0|Absolutely essential for Beatles fans.  Most of the Beatles story was already known by the fans and even by the non-fans.  What I really liked about this book was their accounting of their pre-fame days.  George Harrison's account of how he and Paul as teens hitchhiked for days, slept on beaches and bleachers, hardly had any money and were just two boys out to see the world was touching.  Paul and John going to Paris together after John gets a 100 pounds as a birthday gift.  The boys almost freezing to death in their unheated van, touring the country (George losing control of it, causing a wreck which injures Neil Aspinall, their roadie, and subsequently getting his license suspended!).<br />Ringo sums it up in the end when he says that the Beatles' story was about four guys who really loved each other.  That love really comes through in this book.  The four of them lived through an experience that no one else had been or ever will be through.  They managed to maintain their sanity and changed the world along the way. Not a bad way to live one's life.
B00006690G|4.0|im so gald that em is back, i rushed out and bought tha eminem show tha day it came out. when i listend to it i noticed sumthin different, he doesnt so much rap about pople he hates like N'sync anymore and this album is a very serious look in to his life, i think the deepest song on tha album wuz cleaning out my closet where he has a half apology to his mother. d12, obie trice, Dr dre, Nate dogg and even his daughter hallie all make apperances on this album to make a [heck] of a good cd. Tha beats are some of the hottest out now, theres a few little things about the album that arent that great but its no big deal compared to the amount of quaulity in the rest of the songs. this cd is not as good as the marshall mathers lp but its definatley worth the money.
B000066NW0|5.0|A critic knows how to judge something in an intelligent and considerable manner. A good critic shows the viewer that no matter how bad they think the material is; they can take it and tear it apart in a civilized manner. Avril Lavigne is a young teen artist playing for teens. Her lyrics are heard through out the world and impact lives just like any other artist. People don't comprehend that her lyrics relate to issues of real life during our teen years. High School is an experience that most people go through, Avril in her song \\"Complicated\\" talks about an issue that many teens struggle with in those years (high school). Whether its your girl-friend or boy-friend being something around you and not the same around his friends, or you trying to impress the popular crowd by wearing certain cloths just to fit in. Those are the issues she explains, to draw the teen crowd who doesn't have role models that talk about issues they struggle with. Be considerable her songs do mean something. Her CD isn't as bad as lots say it is. It doesn't hurt to try something new.  Avril inspires many, not all, but many. Thanks for your time. God bless.
