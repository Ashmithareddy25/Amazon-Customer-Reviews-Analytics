B004Q7CIFI|2.0|I love Stephen King books, having read, probably about 75% of his works. I was looking forward to reading this one, based on the high user reviews, but it took me a couple years to get there. Now, this is a fine work, by a skillful and oh so talented writer, however, I found the novel to be bloated. Yes, S.K. can be wordy and that is to be expected, but this novel had too many parts that simply had no impact on the story.<br /><br />This novel is NOT \\"The Stand\\" or \\"IT\\", and there are too many extra tangents and storylines that detract and take away from what the novel is.  I don't understand why we need to learn about Jake's wife Kristy and her A.A. slogans - neither seemed relevant.<br /><br />I sped through the last half, just to get it finished, and at times skipping/skimming pages (without losing anything important to the story). And after all this slogging, I found myself getting really irritated with all the fluff (fluff that I usually like). Usually, I like how he points out the interesting wording on signs, and misspells words, and other word play, but by the end of the novel, I didn't really want to read anymore. There was a little bit about how the sign at the drive in would be changing to some snappy slogan, when it closed for the fall, and I just wanted to shout ...ENOUGH...get on with the story.<br /><br />There is a major flaw in the story. Instead of hanging around, and hosting fundraisers, and coaching a school play, going to dances, and town events - the main character George/Jake, could have just tracked down Oswald immediately, killed him, and then gone back to the present day and see the effect.<br /><br />Other things. The whole time in Derry, meeting some characters from the novel \\"IT\\", talk and mention of evil places (Derry, Dallas) etc., seemed really irrelevant to the story line. He meets Bevie from the Levie and richie from the ditchie dancing on a lawn somewhere - really - and that was it, no relevance, nothing, just crap from other novels with nothing to do with this one. I think S.K. is prejudiced against pharmacists, as a simple trip to the pharmacy seems to result in negative interactions with the druggists.<br /><br />And the romance aspect - simply terrible ending for such a promising romance.  Sorry, Stephen King, if you are going to write a feel good ending - then it could have been done so much better, and really, there is no valid reason why Jake could not have gone back to 1958 and spent his life there quietly with Sadie - none- really, really!
B007FG9LIE|3.0|The Wayward Pines began in similar vein much like a couple of books I've previously read so it took me several chapters to get into the story line. It wasn't until about halfway that the story  took a surprising twist that made the great plot for the story. But I do have to criticize the reason for the creation of the Wayward Pines. I know this is a fiction story but it seems far fetch for one man to create a place such as this. Would I recommend the book? Perhaps. I will try to pick book to see how the plot thickens.

1594484805|2.0|This book is true in that sometimes money isn't a solely motivator, but then what? You can't hire a software developer with a salary of a garbage collector. If what Pink said is true then Software developer should be incredibly boring or manager are absolutely wrong in how to pays their employees.<br />  Full of fact, \\"the surprising truth\\" is just a useless truth, you will \\"wow\\" sometimes in this book but this book has no practical application, doesn't teach us how to motivate ourselves.<br />  If someone want to motivate themselves or manager want to motivates employees, then these TED's idea I will write down below worths 100 times than this book.<br />  This book is garbage.<br /><br />1)  Seeing the fruits of our labor may make us more productive<br />.<br />The Study: In a study conducted at Harvard University, Ariely asked participants to build characters from Lego's Bionicles series. In both conditions, participants were paid decreasing amounts for each subsequent Bionicle: $3 for the first one, $2.70 for the next one, and so on. But while one group's creations were stored under the table, to be disassembled at the end of the experiment, the other group's Bionicles were disassembled as soon as they'd been built. \\"This was an endless cycle of them building and we destroying in front of their eyes,\\" Ariely says.<br />.<br />The Results: The first group made 11 Bionicles, on average, while the second group made only seven before they quit.<br />.<br />The Upshot: Even though there wasn't huge meaning at stake, and even though the first group knew their work would be destroyed at the end of the experiment, seeing the results of their labor for even a short time was enough to dramatically improve performance.<br />.<br />2)  The less appreciated we feel our work is, the more money we want to do it<br />.<br />The Study: Ariely gave study participants -- students at MIT -- a piece of paper filled with random letters, and asked them to find pairs of identical letters. Each round, they were offered less money than the previous round. People in the first group wrote their names on their sheets and handed them to the experimenter, who looked it over and said \\"Uh huh\\" before putting it in a pile. People in the second group didn't write down their names, and the experimenter put their sheets in a pile without looking at them. People in the third group had their work shredded immediately upon completion.<br />.<br />The Results: People whose work was shredded needed twice as much money as those whose work was acknowledged in order to keep doing the task. People in the second group, whose work was saved but ignored, needed almost as much money as people whose work was shredded.<br />.<br />The Upshot: \\"Ignoring the performance of people is almost as bad as shredding their effort before their eyes,\\" Ariely says. \\"The good news is that adding motivation doesn't seem to be so difficult. The bad news is that eliminating motivation seems to be incredibly easy, and if we don't think about it carefully, we might overdo it.\\"<br />.<br />3)  The harder a project is, the prouder we feel of it<br />.<br />The Study: In another study, Ariely gave origami novices paper and instructions to build a (pretty ugly) form. Those who did the origami project, as well as bystanders, were asked at the end how much they'd pay for the product. In a second trial, Ariely hid the instructions from some participants, resulting in a harder process -- and an uglier product.<br />.<br />The Results: In the first experiment, the builders paid five times as much as those who just evaluated the product. In the second experiment, the lack of instructions exaggerated this difference: builders valued the ugly-but-difficult products even more highly than the easier, prettier ones, while observers valued them even less.<br />.<br />The Upshot: Our valuation of our own work is directly tied to the effort we've expended. (Plus, we erroneously think that other people will ascribe the same value to our own work as we do.)<br />.<br />4)  Knowing that our work helps others may increase our unconscious motivation<br />.<br />The Study: As described in a recent New York Times Magazine profile, psychologist Adam Grant led a study at a University of Michigan fundraising call center in which  student who had benefited from the center's scholarship fundraising efforts spoke to the callers for 10 minutes.<br />.<br />The Results: A month later, the callers were spending 142 percent more time on the phone than before, and revenues had increased by 171 percent, according to the Times. But the callers denied the scholarship students' visit had impacted them.<br />.<br />The Upshot: \\"It was almost as if the good feelings had bypassed the callers' conscious cognitive processes and gone straight to a more subconscious source of motivation,\\" the Times reports. \\"They were more driven to succeed, even if they could not pinpoint the trigger for that drive.\\"<br />.<br />5)  The promise of helping others makes us more likely to follow rules<br />.<br />The Study: Grant ran another study (also described in the Times profile) in which he put up signs at a hospital's hand-washing stations, reading either \\"Hand hygiene prevents you from catching diseases\\" or \\"Hand hygiene prevents patients from catching diseases.\\"<br />.<br />The Results: Doctors and nurses used 45 percent more soap or hand sanitizer in the stations with signs that mentioned patients.<br />.<br />The Upshot: Helping others through what's called \\"prosocial behavior\\" motivates us.<br />.<br />6) AND THE MOST IMPORTANT:::  Positive reinforcement about our abilities may increase performance<br />.<br />The Study: Undergraduates at Harvard University gave speeches and did mock interviews with experimenters who were either nodding and smiling or shaking their heads, furrowing their eyebrows, and crossing their arms.<br />.<br />The Results: The participants in the first group later answered a series of numerical questions more accurately than those in the second group.<br />.<br />The Upshot: Stressful situations can be manageable--it all depends on how we feel. We find ourselves in a \\"challenge state\\" when we think we can handle the task (as the first group did); when we're in a \\"threat state,\\" on the other hand, the difficulty of the task is overwhelming, and we become discouraged. We're more motivated and perform better in a challenge state, when we have confidence in our abilities.<br />.<br />Images that trigger positive emotions may actually help us focus<br />.<br />The Study: Researchers at Hiroshima University had university students perform a dexterity task before and after looking at pictures of either baby or adult animals.<br />.<br />The Results: Performance improved in both cases, but more so (10 percent improvement!) when participants looked at the cute pictures of puppies and kittens.<br />.<br />The Upshot: The researchers suggest that \\"the cuteness-triggered positive emotion\\" helps us narrow our focus, upping our performance on a task that requires close attention.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|While the book was not scary in the way that \\"The Shining\\" was, it was interesting to see where Danny Torrance's life has gone in \\"Doctor Sleep\\". As usual, I like his characters; I think King does a great job of fleshing them out and making you care about them.  The \\"True Knot\\" was a great idea, and King even managed to make them somewhat sympathetic.  Abra is a great character - I'd like to see where she goes, too.  I felt the ending was rushed, and way too easy, however.

B0099G6Q5E|4.0|I'd love to give this CD five stars. Most of what's on it deserves five stars plus--great music for listening. But there are some things I'm really unhappy about.<br /><br />Good stuff first. There are a number of performances which sound like they are pretty much the same as in the movie, including the wonderful final performances of the Trebles and the Bellas. Several of the tracks are clearly different, but some of these are great additions. Some of the performances are extended. And \\"Since You've Been Gone,\\" used to amusing effect for the movie in the audition montage, has been rescored and recorded as a duet between Ester Dean and Skylar (?) [Sorry, last name is escaping me]. This is a terrific performance--one of the best tracks on the CD.<br /><br />But some of the changes aren't so good. Someone else has already commented on the different version of \\"No Diggity,\\" which I also find annoying. I really preferred that rather more raw version from the movie. And the addition of treble (as in almost certainly female) voices to the extended version of Right Round was a very bad decision. The falsetto voices are nasal and whiney--they sound like nothing quite as much as the Chipmunk's version of this song. And frankly, I object to female voices being added to a performance by the all-male Treblemakers. (Yes, I know they added a male base voice to the Ballas for the finale, but that's part of the story of the movie, and thus forgivable).<br /><br />However, the thing I really, really dislke about this CD is the final track. In common, I imagine, with most people who loved the music from this movie, I bought a CD to listen to People Making Music With Their Mouths. The final track is an *instrumental* track (and frankly, not a very good one). I have yet to make it all the way through listening to this track. I always end up reaching out and skipping back to the beginning of the CD.<br /><br />This is even more irritating in light of what is *not* on the CD. What aboutthe terrific performance by the Hullabahoos? What about the performance by the group with the underaged kid (can't recall the name they gave the group)? Even the sock puppets would have been preferable. And I'd love to have had a recording of the amusing vocal rendition of the studio's theme which opened the movie.<br /><br />So I rate this CD as a pretty seriously flawed masterpiece.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Such a cute movie that's perfect for the whole family! One of my favorite animated films! Highly reccommend this movie!
B00DL2W7Q4|1.0|Absolutely disappointing. Book starts with a great premises but in a frenzy to fill pages writer lost focus. Each chapter is so long that by the time you reach end you start questioning why author has to fill up so many pages to make a point. It is worth avoiding. If you have read the first chapter you can skip rest of the book. First chapter is worth reading, rest can be skipped.
B004MPI5SS|5.0|I still want to see the original, but I watched this one first because it promised to be awesomely offensive.  LOVED IT!  I love movies where you get to cheer for the killer, and the ways she kills in this are pretty sweet.  It started off kind of slow, especially when the description of the movie tells you exactly what's going to happen, but once the drama kicks in, it doesn't disappoint!

B00CKR63F2|5.0|From the very first sentence, the author begins to create a beautiful setting where you as the reader will live while you're engrossed in this wonderful story. Real places in beautiful Yosemite National Park are combined with characters that are born in the author's wonderful imagination. The story seamlessly weaves back and forth between what almost seems like historical Native American fiction and romantic fantasy. Beyond Bridalveil Fall is a very visual story. Images of breathtaking mountains and waterfalls create beautiful scenes which help to make the book an enjoyable read.<br /><br />The first book in the Dwellers Of Ahwahnee series begins when the main character, beautiful Oria reaches her 18th birthday. Oria is a very special person but she doesn't know it yet. Although she had hints of her special place in the Ahwahneechee tribe as she was growing up, she has no idea how vital her special skills will be to the survival of her people.<br /><br />Oria is mentored by her grandparents who have many powers of their own as she begins to learn about her special powers. Many of the Ahwahneechee people have been waiting for her for many, many years, including one very special person; the handsome, kind and very wise Grey Wolf. Oria has never even had a boyfriend before. When she meets Grey Wolf she is not sure of what she is feeling but when she sees him with another woman, her feelings confirm what she suspects. She is deeply in love with Grey Wolf. She was so sure that Grey Wolf was sincere when he kissed her and told her he had waited for her for a long time. She is confused and doesn't understand why he is with another woman. I've probably already said too much but it is such an interesting story, it's hard to stop writing about it. But I will stop here before I have to issue a spoiler alert.<br /><br />This was the first book I have read about Native American fictional myths and romance and I'm happy there is a book two in this series. I highly recommend thisbook and I'm now off to read book two, Beyond Oria Falls.

I know the premise of a fairytale theme may be a turn off for some people, but these characters are so complex and the issues they face are very real, and each one of us has a common element with these issues at some time or another.  It's a mixed bag of entertainment, and everyone I know (both young and old) watches it and can't wait for the next episode.  I am in the process of re-watching this series from the beginning and am picking up things I missed or had forgotten.  I am enjoying every minute of it.

1476729085|5.0|I almost put this book down after the first few pages, but decided to stick it out and it was a wonderful decision. Spare, yet intense, this is the story of Don.  You know Don, everybody went to school with him. He was the one that was just off, a heartbeat behind everybody else, the one that nobody wanted to date, that kid who was never chosen for a team. Yet, Don is endearing and funny -his gentle humor, so honest and filled with integrity is both heartwarming and entertaining. The book is one of the best I've read in sometime and captures the angst of those people with Ashbergers, functioning autistic folks, who float though life ignored or persecuted for their differences.  This book is a triumph of individuality, that when we bother to look deeply and really get to know people, we may find something there that wipes away the labels that separates and puts a patina of unacceptability on those of us that are just a bit odd. This book is really the Human Project that everyone can take a little bit away and enjoy the quirks that make us all the individuals we are.

0380715430|5.0|I didn't read any reviews of \\"The Mother Tongue\\" before I read it. To tell the truth, I'm glad I didn't. I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  I'm not a linguist, so I will take their word for it (in their negative reviews) that there are errors in this book. My copy is a first edition from 1990 - maybe changes have been made in later editions.<br /><br />But if Bryson got some numbers and details wrong (even I knew that the Eskimo words for snow stuff was an old mistake, and recent DNA results show that people of European stock do indeed have Neanderthal DNA), there's plenty of information where he's using quotes, etc., that aren't mistakes. Best of all, Bryson's writing style is as if he's sitting in your living room telling a comic tale.<br /><br />And, I think it is fair to say that there are disputes in linguistics - not everybody agrees on the way a word or language happened.<br /><br />Not all changes to the language have been for the better. Shakespeare could chose between saying, \\"this hat\\" - \\"that hat\\" - and \\"yon hat\\".  There is a neat distinction between the last two and it's too bad we don't use the latter anymore.<br /><br />And how about how we've lost prefix or suffix-less forms, to the language's detriment. Bryson writes that we have \\"inept, disheveled, incorrigible, ruthless, unkempt - for which the positive form is missing. English would be richer if we could say admiringly of a tidy person, 'She's SO sheveled,' or praise a capable person for being full of ept or an energetic one for having heaps of ert. Many of these words did once have positive forms. Ruthless was companioned by Ruth, meaning compassion. One of Milton's poems contains the well-known line 'Look homeward, Angel, now, and melt with ruth.' \\"<br /><br />What do you do with a language where a word can have two meanings, opposite to each other?<br />Sanction = permission or forbiddance<br />Cleave = cut in two or stick together<br />Fast = stuck firmly in place or moving quickly<br /><br />They occur, of course, because the language is constantly changing from one force or another. For example, \\"peruse actually means to read thoroughly, not glance through.\\"  This left me despairing. I have been fighting a losing battle to keep a reasonably original definition of \\"decimate\\". Originally, when a conquered army was captured, the Roman victor might chose to execute only 1 in 10 of the captured soldiers. Deci = tenth. So in modern terms, decimate actually means only a tenth is destroyed. But newspapers and news announcers insist on using it to mean near-total destruction. I am a curmudgeon about it - to no avail.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book was about dialects. I watch a lot of BBC, and got a kick out of Bryson's description of the dialect called Fraffly (also called Hyperlect), \\"based on the aristocratic pronunciation of 'frightfully', as in \\"Weh sue fraffly gled yorkered calm' (We're so frightfully glad you could come). The main distinguishing characteristic of the speech is the ability to talk without moving the lips. (Prince Charles is an ace at this.)\\"  Perhaps this is not the most scientific of paragraphs, but it is certainly entertaining.<br /><br />As is the whole book. I very much enjoyed reading \\"The Mother Tongue\\".<br /><br />Happy Readernging from one force or another. For example, \\"peruse actually means to read thoroughly, not glance through.\\"  This left me despairing. I have been fighting a losing battle to keep a reasonably original definition of \\"decimate\\".

I am a curmudgeon about it - to no avail.    My favorite part of the book was about dialects. I watch a lot of BBC, and got a kick out of Bryson's description of the dialect called Fraffly (also called Hyperlect), \\"based on the aristocratic pronunciation of 'frightfully', as in \\"Weh sue fraffly gled yorkered calm' (We're so frightfully glad you could come). The main distinguishing characteristic of the speech is the ability to talk without moving the lips. (Prince Charles is an ace at this.)\\"  Perhaps this is not the most scientific of paragraphs, but it is certainly entertaining.    As is the whole book. I very much enjoyed reading \\"The Mother Tongue\\".    Happy Reader
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I installed this dongle a few days ago and I am using it a lot. I've watched all my &#34;Favorites&#34; and &#34;Watch Later&#34; videos on Youtube.<br /><br />It's awesome to control everything from my phone/tablet/laptop no matter where I am in my house.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|The critiques and reviews are a bit harsh on Mr. Jaden.  He did a great all around job - can't imagine all the physical scenes he had to get right and spot on.  Loved 'the suit'.  The main things against him were lack of scene/story development in the beginning, a bit too much of the same type of facial stoicism in all the scenes from the father character as well as a bit too much of the same facial expressions  on Jaden required I assume by the directing. The variety of the events and memory playbacks vs. the emotional balance 'negotiated' in the script could have used just one crack of a smile from  Will Smith so that the audience could connect with his character just a tiny bit in the middle of the film.  His son is capable of the family charm too - just a different style that we hopefully see more of in the future.  Story was good and effects were both good and great.  M. Night Shyamalan is a master at surprise, music match, and unusual character decisions in scripts - so was definitely looking for a bit more of this but I liked it.  Really glad to see Jaden's acting and character finally get to vent and challenge his 'character' Dad in the film - great job!  And thank you to the Smith family for making the sacrifices required to do 'The Pursuit of Happiness' and 'I am Legend' - both which actually saved me during a really really rough time.  Truly wish I could help behind the scenes in this industry - there is so much more HEALING to be done on this planet.  The Smith family and Mr. Shyamalan seem to have the same overall agenda.  But for the present - 3 cheers and many blessings to the ENTIRE team of talent and investors involved in the venture of 'After Earth'.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is a great book glad my friend bugged me into reading it, if you want an additive book this is the one for you
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This is a great collection for any true Indiana Jones fan. All four of the movies are there with great special features. For nearly twenty years these films have been a favorite of mine and are a great choice for any lover of great action-adventure movies
B0089LOG02|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was very moving the heart ache &love. I recommend it to everyone who likes a moving story.
B00005K424|5.0|Love this game! Like chess, you can play with your kids and grown up friends and it's always challenging and fun. Travel size is easy to pack up and you miss nothing from not having the full size version.
B00D3NSDVO|4.0|Fast paced, exciting, intelligent. Carefully structured.<br />As with similar books, the time factor, especially in the most tense scenes is not always believable.<br />Better character development of the heroes than in similar books.<br />Nice ending.
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|My husband and I watched this recently.  We love scary movies and since this one had Jennifer Lawrence in it we thought we'd try it.  We both liked it.  It was scary, intense, and had an unexpected twist.
B0000057D8|5.0|Wanted Bach music because our local Bach station went offline.  Chose several from Amazon after reading reviews.  Was very satisfied and felt reviewers gave plenty of information to quide my choice.  Bought several different CD and have enjoyed each very much.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I had already seen this movie and loved it.  I purchased it for my mom.  She absolutely loved the movie.
B0007P0LPC|4.0|Very classy version of SL.  Was very surprised with the dancing quality (at this point in her life) of Margo Fonteyn who was quite a few years older than Nureyev.  A worthy version to have!.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Probably just being old, but the rules are not clear for me. Fun game for a first time app user. Jesus loves you!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Interesting post-apocalyptic setting, all told from the protagonists perspective, with the usual well executed plot twists Brandon Sanderson is well known for.
B00280LYHS|5.0|A great ending to the first five books and I am definitely going to buy Lost Hero as I will  also recommend this series for anyone who wants a good book series to read
B008J2GAKU|5.0|first comic I have ever read. really liked it.  I liked reading it on the iPad Kindle app as well.
0446547646|5.0|Very fast shipping. Nicholas sparks is my favorite author I have not read a book of his I didnt like. this is NO exception.
B00E9P959O|5.0|To steal a line from the song 'Peaceable Kingdom' - 'The ones we wish would listen are never going to hear', this sums up nicely the problems I had with the original version of this album.  I could never truly hear all these great songs through the noise of the original's very hot mixing/mastering.  I knew there were some great songs hiding in there, but never managed to get through even half the album without having to reach for the aspirin.<br /><br />Well, this remixed version finally proved my hunch correct - this collection of songs in my humble opinion is the best since Moving Pictures.  The remixing has allowed each instrument to be heard, the lyrics can now easily be understood, and you can play on the proper 'blow the doors off' volume without having your ears bleed.  Each and every song is special and even my two skips on the original (OLV and OoTC) are enjoyed.<br /><br />Everyone who is even a minor Rush fan should give this remix a chance for you will truly hear these songs for the first time.
B00867GKIK|2.0|Ok let's be honest the only reason that im giving 2 stars to this seller its because i paid for this product and i suppose to get a complet  dvd set, but when i got them on my hands and i was gonna check if everything was ok what was my surprise that there was one disc missing ... So sad about it
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|Very good Quality/Price ratio ! I Use it professionally during lectures and during scientific presentations. The only warning could be about &#34;mechanical strength&#34;: must be handled with care !<br />I normally use the original box in order to carry it with me.

1451695195|2.0|[[ASIN:1451695195 Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife]]<br /><br />Frankly, I was disappointed in this book.  The details about what this man experienced of the Afterlife, first of all, are highly diluted by his constant return to describing his childhood, career, family, his illness that led to his coma, every detail of his treatment while in coma, every detail his wife and family had while he was in coma, blah-blah-blah.  The author struck me as highly egotistical -- in short, stuck on himself, his expertise, his superiority.  I read nothing in his book about the Afterlife that I'd not encountered numerous times in other books written long before this guy came along.  I also read nothing in his book that would make me want to encourage anyone else to read this book.  I consider it a waste of time and money.  I gave my copy away to a library so they needn't waste money buying a copy.
B000LXQVA4|4.0|Our daughter loves her Jumperoo and she's not yet 5 months old.  She's much bigger than the average baby at 19 lbs, but I think any baby at least 25&#34; long would do just fine on the lowest setting.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because my daughter likes the Jumperoo Go Wind more than the Rainforest.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I am on this game more than my kids. My kids loved the movie so the game was a must.
B005FPT51K|4.0|I like the camera good sleek design, set up was easy on our iphones.  App is OK, alerts could use some work, as they seem to be highly sensitive even at setting &#34;1&#34;. Sound cuts in a out - but thats a app thing not the camera, so I can't fault the product- just the software. Night vison works great.<br />No issues with camera at all.<br /><br />Works perfect on Wifi, Took a bit to get through my firewall (netgear Prosafe Firewall) and Cisco Router, but once I was able to allow the proper rules to allow it through I could access no problem on my iphone on 3G, other wifi networks, or from my Office Computer to spy on the wife and kid ;)

1932100660|5.0|This book exemplifies the best use of the scientific side of nutritional knowledge  from both epidemiological and lab. studies, and is the result of much careful work.
140006922X|1.0|After I finished this book I wished I have 30 years or so...to research all what it is written in this book (like the author claim that he did) and check what it was not taking in consideration, and then be sure what is true, what is out of contest or an exaggeration or what has been minimize to let believe the reader that Jesus was just another man. Of course unfortunately I do not have the time.<br /><br />Over all this book has a tendency to discredit the greatness of Jesus, is inclined to put Jesus like just one more of his peers<br />or contemporaries just a Jew for Nazareth.(The author claims to have a Muslim faith)<br /><br />I wonder if.... it would have been better if I should not have read it at all, besides it was not a cheap book.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|It's 007 I love. You can change the actor, but you can't change The character, although Connery and Moore were the best.
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|A good movie for kids and I wasn't that bored either.<br />I don't know what it is about these Lego minifigures but the kids love 'em...<br />Bottom Line: If you've played the game you'll like the movie
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Excellent album, but its nothing new from Alterbridge. I'm used to those hard driving rhythms soul barring lyrics incredible guitar riffs from Mark Tremonti and then there's Myles. Its just another great album from an under appreciated Band.<br />Added 9/15/15:<br />Here it is almost two years after the release of this album and I still can't get enough of it. We saw Alterbridge live soon after they released this collection. They achieve an almost recorded sound live, it simply amazing. If you've never seen this band, do so, you won't be disappointed.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Good graphics and original story lime.<br />but too many hidden object games, not enough puzzles Some objects invisible even with 5X magnifier. After tapping many times on an object, the hint button takes you to the same spot.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I really enjoyed the characters and my heart hurt for the little number eighty-six.  I was happy with the ending and I wouldn't mind a follow up book to spend more time with Jamie and Lily!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great series, each episode gets better, acting is incredible, sets and costumes superior!  I strongly recommend viewing this series.  Five stars!
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|The game was ok... the puzzles were fun but the game is so short it is not worth paying 4.99 I beat it in a day.....
B003OF3R0S|5.0|Awesome sound, i would reccomend to all rock lover out there, old school meets the new sound!! great stuff. Awesome.
0060734191|5.0|Portrays a really cool fantasy world, that's different than most other stories. First book isn't the best but by the very end everything fits and it has a great ending.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Excellent,  I wasn't sure what to expect but totally blown away and impressed, sound and engineering was great and songs just kept getting better and better.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Poor Rose has had a hard life, but nothing like what's going on now.  With everything that's going on, she has a new neighbor, Joe, who finds Rose intriguing and very different from anyone he's ever met.  With a sense of humor and a few mishaps along the way, Rose and Joe's lives entangle in a web  of lies, deceit, and oddly enough, passion.  This book is a great read, and one you won't want to miss!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I'm enjoying these episodes just as much as the originals... Congrats to Spock, Bones, Kirk, the Producers and everyone else involved.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Great Series do not know why i have not been watching up till now look forward to the next season DVD
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Pros: A continuance of the first two films.<br />Cons: A little too many Iron Men in this movie for me. But that is very easily overlooked.
B00DJYKFXG|2.0|Loved The Band for decades...and so excited to see a new release.  However, there is nothing live on this DVD...they are all still pictures shown to Band songs.  The film part has exactly TWO actual footages of the concerts.  Not at all what I expected.  On a positive note, was so ticked off, I bought the film &#34;Ain't in it for my health&#34; just to see some actual Levon footage--Amazing.  Definitely worth it.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I started using Feedly after Google Reader. It runs in Firefox as an add-on and on my kindle fire and Nexus 4 as an app. It is easy to add feeds and I can classify them under different heads conveniently. Navigation is easy. Interface intuitive. Sometimes it is slow to load full contents. Beside occasional sluggishness, I have no issues with Freely.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|no like, This game is not a challange to adults, it is more a childs game and not much fun to play.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|But it turned out to be a lot more interesting than I thought.<br />Although it makes promises that the experiments from the book guarantee proof....and I wouldn't go that far. Only one of the (5 or 6? Can't recall the total) experiments gave me any results but that was enough keep me intrigued lol.<br />Overall the book is really about how your thoughts influence the outcome of your reality and how you can better manage it. I liked it, feel like I finally understood what others have tried to explain but failed to get across. It's a quick read and was only $2.80 when I bought it.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|If you like stories written on a fifth grade reading level with one dimensional characters, repetitive phrasing and grammatical errors, this is the book for you.  About 20 pages in I made a game of marking every page that had an error.  There were misspellings, words missing from sentences, extra words in sentences, homophone and tense errors.  Do they not have proofreaders at publishing houses anymore?  It was horribly distracting.<br /><br />If that's not enough to give you pause, the story itself is totally unbelievable.  By the second day after the main character runs away he is the hero of the kingdom, having become beloved of the king, the highest ranking knight in the kingdom, two of the king's sons and the king's daughter.  Of course that doesn't last long. The same king who was hailing him as a hero, taking him in as one of his own family, giving him fabulous gifts and showing him off to the rest of the knights as the epitome of everything fabulous, has him thrown into the dungeon two days later.  Why?  Because our hero saved the king's life from an assassination attempt.  Yep.  Apparently in this world if you do your sworn duty of protecting the king, a king who has stated you are part of his family and our hero \\"can see the love in his eyes\\" your reward is to be arrested and thrown in jail because  suddenly the king totally trusts in the word of his older son, the one we've been told repeatedly the king doesn't like or trust. In fact he dislikes and distrusts this son so much that he passes him over when forced to name an heir. And that's not the most senseless plot device either.<br /><br />Even though Amazon was offering this book for $0.00, I still feel ripped off.
B002ZG974M|5.0|Heart warming.  Bought it for my first-time pregnant daughter to ease her anxiety.  Universal experience since the beginning of time.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Good mental exercise. I enjoyed it very much. The only negative is that I ran out of puzzles way to soon.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|From the opening crunch of Made Up Mind, being Misunderstood because you have Whiskey Legs while riding out The Storm and finally Calling Out to You this is a complete triumph of music.  This is what I expected from the minute I read they were joining forces and Revelator was fine even good to great but this effort outshines it in my opinion at every beat, every strum and every lyric.  I don't know what greater accolade to heap on the 50 plus minutes than it makes me believe in today's artist again.  I have been listening to music from the past over the last 6 months or so, not being able to find anything new that really strikes my fancy but then this drops into my lap.  Actually everything I just bought has been overall really really good but this was the crown jewel of the batch.  You like great rock music with a little blues some jazz a tinge of country then you want this album, you want it right this minute...
B0079J28NC|3.0|It shows in pretty good detail how to build model kits of various versions of the FW-190 in different scales from several manufacturers, but I expected it to show details of the actual aircraft, to allow an experienced modeler to detail and accurize his own model. It didn't show anything of the real aircraft at all, so it's interesting but not particularluy useful.
B00DQBWLSO|3.0|It has hits and misses for me, maybe it will grow on me like Born and Raised did after repeated listens.  Hits like Wildfire, Who you Love, I will Be Found and On the Way Home are great but others miss or remind me of the Lullaby song (Paper Doll).  Overall I was expecting more.  I must say that hearing Katy Perry do something beyond the bubblegum pop was a nice treat, I find I have more appreciation for her voice and talents.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|The story of a mild-mannered school teacher.  He fins he is dying and decides to cook Meth to make money for his family.
B00DSTBMMU|4.0|Like most of us, Sheryl is aging, her music is aging with her and that is a very good thing indeed.  I am first to admit if I would have heard this album 15 years ago as her follow up to Leaving Las Vegas I would have listened once and gave up on her as an artist but she didn't she released 2 brilliant albums after LLV and then a suffling bumbling series of albums after that, none were awful but none getting anywhere near her high watermark set from the first 3.  then came 100 Miles from Memphis (I think that is the title.... I am old I forget things) and while it wasn't a great listen it was a step back in the right direction.  This is the full step back, a different sound certainly as the strong rock-n-roll tones have been swapped for more mainstream country but this works for my ears as well as any transition could.  From Shotgun through Best of Times (I will admit Stay at Home Mother is not a favorite) she changes her sound to a little more country than rock and roll with mostly terrific results.  She still doesn't really have the voice for a ballad and sometimes her lyrics are rather uninspired but that has always been part of the package and frankly that is just fine.  I am already looking forward to what she will do next and it has been a long long time since I would say that.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game is a whole lot of fun. The graphics are superb, the story is pretty full for a mobile/tablet game, the leveling system is immersive and the UI/gameplay smart.<br /><br />I have two big complaints with this game though. The potion system is very limiting. Three potions can be held on hand at any given time, using one will require one of two things before being replenished: a timer to wait on or spending premium currency to purchase new ones. My biggest gripe though, by far, is the advantages that premium currency gives a player. Anything in the game can be unlocked at any level with premium currency, including extra inventory and skill slots; meaning that a level one player that has just finished the tutorial could be equipped with the top-tier gear. This makes the PvP section of the game nearly useless to a player who doesn't want to cash out.<br /><br />That being said, this is a wonderful game if you just keep patience and grind away. What I would love to see is a paid version of this for $4-7 with the premium currency eliminated. I know it won't happen as long as enough people are taking advantage of the premium currency. But a guy can wish, right?
0385535147|2.0|Was disappointed in this book. Took too long to get going and really wasn't rooting for the main character because I didn't feel he had any great redeeming qualities.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I'm very happy with this purchase because it arrived in a timely manner and in great condition! It's a birthday present that I ordered last minute and wasn't sure if it was going to be here in time, but it was so I couldn't be happier :)
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I'm on my fall break, and reading keeps me busy. I started this book noon today and finished it at 9, non-stop. It's that good. I laughed and cried. Rose Gardner is an amazing character. This book keeps you guessing. Is Joe a good or bad guy? What's happening? I won't spoil it, so read it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I tried playing this game on my ipod touch and it lagged to much to play but it doesn't lag on kindle<br />its a great game

B001NLL93W|5.0|Can't put the books down. Such a intriguing story, very well told. I love the supernatural element, but that it's not cheesy and not another story based solely on vampires or zombies.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|What more can I say? A rat, a red headed cartoon man, and free cooking lessons is all it took for me to rate this movie a delicious 5 stars.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it has all kinds of different things going on. its a really fun game. I highly reccomend for any one.

B0092S4WLY|4.0|I downloaded Floors Escape on a whim and I am glad I did. Some of the levels were easy but some actually made me think. For me this game is a great way to relax before bed.
B004U52VPS|5.0|my son loves this game. He loves playing it. It is really fun to watch him put it together and try to knock it all down again.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I stayed away from this one until it came out as a rental because of the negative buzz.  Just rented it and watched (with rather low expectations) and enjoyed it.  In fact, if I'd seen it in theaters, I wouldn't have felt cheated a bit.  Jaden Smith is the lead in this, and he does a creditable job.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good book pretty interesting twist. The book played the foundation for the third book to make sense. I recommend this book to anyone
1439152802|5.0|I love love love Kate Morton. Since reading The Forgotten Garden, and The Distant Hours I've been anxiously waiting to read this one. The story follows basically one family from World War II in the London Blitz to the present day, with sections switching from WWII to now. Ms. Morton introduces the lead female characters early in the book, when they are about 14 or so - one girl in England and the other in Australia. In the present time, one of these women is in a nursing home and drifting to the end of her life. Because of this one of her daughters decides its time to find out her mother's history, and how all the contradicting bits of her mother's life story fit together. What is the truth? I wish I could write this review as well as Kate Morton writes her stories and then it would be easy for me to tell another reader why they will love this book. Not only is the story fascinating with period detail, the mystery of their lives gets more and more compelling and I literally could not put it down - I read the 500+ pages in 2 days and resented having to sleep.
B004G606K8|5.0|Read this book back in the 80's decided to read it again and it is just as good as it was then.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this backback to consolidate my 3 camera bags into one. I am still amazed that I was able to do so with room to spare! The interior of the backpack is incredibly modular with strong velcro that doesn't easily become detached. There are so many pockets which makes it easy to organize everything. The value of this bag is incredible compared to others that cost $60 or more. I have nothing negative to say!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is an excellent application. I can use it to download and read the reference I need that are not in any other comercially recognized program.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Fully deserving of being a best seller. Captivating from start to finish. I would  definitely recommend to any adult reader.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|My mom and I both love Bingo Blitz, the rewards are easy to come by and bingos are as well.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|If you use Ebay with any frequency this app is awesome. Easy to use and understand for anybody. Highly recommend.
B0045ZAQSM|5.0|Soul Kitchen's storyline has been related in previous reviews and needn't be rehashed here.  The movie is about life in Hamburg.  All the characters are so quintessentially Hamburg it is like taking a dive into the city and coming back out at the end.  The soundtrack is wonderfully complimentary and adds another dimension to the movie.  Fatih Akin has captured the essence of the city in such a direct, unsentimental and unaffected way - it's simply marvelous.  Truly a masterpiece.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I write this review as a 25 y.o. This game is extremely entertaining for people of all ages. If you like the Minions you will enjoy this game!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs has always captured my attention and I look at him as a personal hero.  This book is fantastic and would recommend it to anyone!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The Chromecast was fairly easy to setup on my laptop and Droid 4 smartphone.  Had real problems setting it up on our Amazon Kindle Fire, and even after I got it working, it caused a crash (had to reset Fire to factory defaults to get all our books back).  Also, I was not expecting that the Chromecast would need to be plugged in (ac power) to work.<br /><br />The intent was to make streaming from Netflix to our TV easier than it currently is, using the laptop + HDMI cable plugged into the wall-mounted flat screen.......but in the end, this is just as complicated, and looks just as unsightly, since there's now another cord to deal with.<br /><br />Also - tried to stream from Amazon Prime Video, and it was choppy.  Poor quality.  I'd only get this if you stream most of your content (as opposed to having satellite or cable) AND you don't mind having another power cable to deal with.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Ok. The book was well written with pretty good editing. However, it was slow to start and just didn't grip me like I thought it would. Love the concept of the story line but it just wasn't good enough for me to give a 5 star rating.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a good puzzle game and addictive too. The graphics are clear but would like to see different pictures once you move to higher levels.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|I actually bought this movie for my granddaughter.  I watched with her  enjoyed it.  She sang the cup song all day everyday.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|The strength of this work is in the fact I have purchased absolutely EVERYTHING Mark has done - the books, the dvds and the app simply because it is just about the best work out there on overall strength training for everybody out there.<br /><br />As a guy who always lifted heavy things, I had to be convinced before believing I didn't need to be in a gym and use weights, but that came within the first few workouts because you might be able to lift a ton of weight, but using the exercises and routines as prescribed by Mark will kick your butt more !<br /><br />So now im getting a better overall strength workout, but my joints are improving from the years of abuse and I save $$$ on gym fees and travel time !<br /><br />Thanks Mark

B008JFUNNM|5.0|To the surprise of many, Tom Hanks hasn't won an Academy Award since 1995 (Forrest Gump), and even more surprising is the fact he hasn't been nominated for an Academy Award since 2001 (Cast Away).  However, it's not as though his acting ability has diminished in his 12 year drought - just his acting frequency.  Within the last ten years, his roles have been sporadic at best and shockingly mediocre at times - especially in films like The Ladykillers, Larry Crowne, and Angels & Demons.  Although his acting career may seem less important, it's not as though he's left the entertainment business - he's simply taken on different roles in the entertainment business, such as play actor and executive producer.  But, fear not Tom Hanks fans - it would appear his lack of Academy recognition will be coming to an end with the upcoming award season as Hanks should have no problem earning a lead actor nomination for his portrayal as Captain Richard Phillips in Captain Phillips.<br /><br />Based on a true story and directed by Paul Greengrass (United 93, The Bourne Ultimatum), Captain Phillips stars Tom Hanks as Richard Phillips, Captain of the United States transport ship, Maersk Alabama.  On the way to Africa, the Maersk Alabama is approached and eventually hijacked by a crew of Somali pirates, led by their own Captain - named Muse (Barkhad Abdi).  However, once aboard the ship, the Somalis are unable to operate the vessel, forcing them to abandon their plan and head home - but not before they take a hostage with them.  Tensions run high as the U.S. Navy is called in to defuse the situation, either by freeing Captain Phillips or stopping the Somalis by any means necessary.  Catherine Kener, Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed, Mahat M. Ali, & Yul Vazquez also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />If you're unaware of the actual events of the Maersk Alabama hijacking in April 2009, you're encouraged to keep it that way, at least until after you see this movie.  Obviously, like any means of entertainment, if you know how something is going to turn out, the build-up isn't as exciting.  With that being said, I'll happily admit that the real life events of this story had somehow escaped my memory, so I had no idea how this film was going to end.  For better or worse, the high amount of tension involved with this film's plot literally had me biting my finger nails for nearly the entirety of the film.  Much like last year's critically acclaimed film, Argo, Captain Phillips progresses in a similar manner, depicting an emotionally taxing historical event.  The progression of the story is fueled by copious amounts of emotional stress, and focuses on lead characters that you can't help but become emotionally attached to.  And, while Argo was brilliant in its own right, Captain Phillips is a much more personal tale, which also happens to deal with hostages being taken during a rather unique scenario.<br /><br />While Captain Phillips is a masterfully written story (scripted by Billy Ray), Tom Hanks is the real attraction of this film.  Not since Forrest Gump has Tom Hanks been this awe-inspiring, bringing a screen presence that is all-domineering in every facet of the film.  Unquestionably, Hanks radiates in his portrayal of this brave, selfless hero that puts his crew above and beyond his own safety - qualities that anyone and everyone can admire.  While Hanks' career is already defined by so many quality roles, this portrayal of Captain Phillips is easily one of his top five portrayals, rivaling any of his previous roles (other than Forrest Gump - which will easily go down as his greatest role of all-time).  In any event, if you're a Tom Hanks fan (and I don't know many people that aren't), this film will re-cement him on your list of the best actors in the world today.<br /><br />The most shocking aspect of this film is the fact that the Somali pirates, portrayed by Barkhad Abdi, Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed, and Mahat M. Ali, have never acted in afeature film prior to Captain Phillips.  The best part about it is that if I wouldn't have just told you that particular tidbit, you would have never noticed.  In fact, you'll likely assume these guys are all well-established in the industry - only you've just never seen them before.  It's obviously a major gamble from the casting department, but it's a gamble that couldn't have gone any better and pays off in dividends.  While each of the pirates play a significant role in this film, Barkhad Abdi plays a much more important role than his three counterparts, portraying Captain Phillips's main rival.  Even though Tom Hanks owns nearly every scene of this film, his character is only as strong as the main villain, a role that Abdi pulls off brilliantly.  It wouldn't be a surprise in the least to hear a substantial amount of award buzz surround Abdi for depiction of the pirate known as Muse.<br /><br />The beauty of a film like Captain Phillips is that it's an all-encompassing film hat quickly reaches out and snatches your attention to the point that you'll forget that you're even watching a movie.  From the pirate's first attempt to take the ship, all the way until the final scenes of the film - each and every passing moment is just as vital and important as the last, causing you to become emotionally invested in the outcome of Captain Phillips and his crew.  And, even since the successful elimination of Osama bin Laden, featured prominently in Zero Dark Thirty, there has been a great deal of interest in previous Seal Team Six missions, one of which was defusing the tense situation while Captain Phillips was in captivity.  Naturally, the incorporation of the seals also adds to the general interest of a story the one might simply chalk up to being a random pirate encounter.<br /><br />Overall, there's no doubt that Captain Phillips is the best film of 2013 - at least up to this point (and it will be nearly impossible to overtake).  The level of passion and sentiment emanating from this film is the reason many of us (including myself) go to the movies.  This film provides an escape from reality as a means to witness one of the more stressful, thrilling, and eventually heart-warming events - not just in real life, but also on the big screen.  Tom Hanks brings the character of Richard Phillips to the forefront, and with good reason.  At a time when he was in need, this film also sheds light on the often unaccounted heroic actions of the United States military and the lengths they will go to protect its citizens.  To be honest, there's too many aspects of this film to praise in one short review, but the bottom line is this thrilling drama screams (to the rafters) Academy Award winner - for several individual (writing, screenplay) and group efforts (cinematography, production design), including Best Motion Picture.  In other words, go see this movie.  Go now!<br /><br />GRADE: A<br />FNDNreview.comfeature film prior to Captain Phillips.

B003MC5N28|5.0|I thought this was a very interesting read.  This book reminded me of how things can be if some people get their way in making all things equal to everyone.  It was disturbing, but I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B0090P0O70|5.0|The story is much longer and more complex than any of the &#34;Frankenstein&#34; movies. It takes place over a period of several years, with monster creation given one paragraph. The story focusses on Victor Frankenstein himself, and how his creation of a living creature -- and his responsibilities to it -- effect his life. If you only know the Hammer films, this book will be something of a surprise. Highly recommended.

If you already love &#34;Blade Runner,&#34; prepare to see it in a way you've not experienced before, my friends! And this is also the best version -- The Final Cut, which is the way Ridley Scott really intended the film to be. Scott has made a lot of great films, but &#34;Blade Runner&#34; remains his masterpiece, and now this Blu-ray edition demonstrates that status perfectly.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Chrome can only project what is on the browser, so if you have an Excel sheet, you want to show to the audience, you are better off using Apple TV airplay.  Chromecast works well only with the browser projections, it does so very well.  If I can for 100 dollars project everything on the computer and more with Apple TV, I think Apple TV is a better buy than the Chromecast.

Johnny Sokko and his Flying Robot? Dungeons and Dragon's modules? I was transfixed, this book was speaking to me.  It was describing events that I hadn't forgotten but made up so much of my childhood that I felt this book was written *for* me.  Ultraman? Black Tiger? Tomb of Horrors?  This is truly an 80's geek kid's Da Vinci code, and it takes place in a future that you can almost see happening.  I never wanted the book to end, and when I wasn't up till 2 am reading it, I was thinking about it all day.  The OASIS are you kidding me?  I can't wait to re-read this.

She became obsessed with Pocahontas because she knew that was a real story. I was trying to find a good movie to cheer her up. Initially, I was just looking for a Disney movie about animals or something. But then I remembered the story of Anastasia and the pieces of truth behind the story. I was able to watch this with her and explain that most of the movie is made up, but that there once was a grand duchess of Russia that did go missing and this movie was written about that small history fact. She loved it and her faith was restored in the happiness of Disney.

B008K9SG9K|5.0|I stumbled across this band about two months ago. I heard Radioactive on the radio, and heard it was by a new group called Imagine Dragons. I decided they might be worth looking into, since Radioactive had been an okay song. I searched \\"Imagine Dragons\\" on Youtube and clicked on the music video for the song \\"Demons\\". Then I bought the album. Demons is such a powerful song, with an amazing message. The other songs are great, and a few are amazing, but Demons steals the show. Some of my favorite songs are Demons, On top of the World, It's Time, and Bleeding out. Anyway, I'll review each of the songs on it's own.<br />Radioactive-<br />The powerful, rhythmic beats in this song inspire. The \\"New Age\\" calls to me every time I hear this song. Welcome to the NEW AGE!<br />Tiptoe-<br />The first \\"happy\\" song of the album, it has a fast-paced catchy beat, and has grown on me a lot since I bought the album. However, it is more of a filler, and I would not buy it on it's own.<br />It's Time-<br />Almost everyone I've met who likes this band say that they found Imagine Dragons through this song. I am the odd one out I guess XD. It has an amazing beat, with good lyrics and great vocals. It's Time to Begin!<br />Demons-<br />Best song of the album. An inspiring song that tells us to consider our inner demons. Consider them, and defeat them. These lyrics, paired with a unstoppable beat, make this song one-in-a-million.<br />On Top of the World-<br />Hands down the catchiest of the songs, it makes up for it's lack of good lyrics with a fun, uplifting beat. You really feel as if your on top of the world when you listen to this song with your headphones turned up. I would definitely recommend this song, even if you don't want to buy the whole album.<br />Amsterdam-<br />Another catchy song, and one that does get stuck in my head a lot. It's definitely not a filler, but it still isn't the best song of the album.<br />Hear Me-<br />Amazing song. I felt like crying the first time I heard it. It's a cry of despair from a suffering man. But what makes Imagine Dragons different is that through the despair, there is hope. An amazing song, with perhaps the best vocals of all of Imagine Dragon's songs.<br />Every Night-<br />Even the best albums have fillers, and this is one of them. Not a great song, and a very skip-able track. However, just because I don't like it doesn't mean that you won't. Give it a listen and see what you think.<br />Bleeding Out-<br />The most underrated of the songs on this album, it is definitely one of the best. The rhythm is spot-on perfect, and the lyrics are powerful. I love this song.<br />Underdog-<br />Not the best song, but still worth getting, if only for it's different beat, catchy lyrics, and uplifting message.<br />Nothing Left to say/Rocks-<br />Nothing Left to Say is an awesome song. It is a haunting song, that causes you to think back upon your life while nodding in time to the beat. Amazing song. Rocks is simply a filler, and isn't that great.<br />My Fault-<br />Not my favorite, but some of my friends love it so maybe you will too. It is a song of complaint, a person asking if it was his/her fault that the relationship ended. Not a great song, but I don't exactly mind it.<br />Round and Round-<br />Another catchy song, this one is a blast. Round and Round, I'm not gonna change my mind!<br />The River-<br />They really bombed this song, in my opinion. It could have been SO much more, but the lyrics just didn't go with the rhythm. Alas, this song is not good.<br />America-<br />I find my self thinking of this song now when I think of my own problems. It tells the simple truth that we all have hardships and trials, but we must press on. Great song.<br />Selene-<br />Alas, the end to an amazing debut album. This song is not my favorite, but it still is catchy, with a Roxanne-ish message that you can always find forgiveness. Good lyrics.<br /><br />Overall, Imagine Dragons is one of the best new bands out there. They just have that winning combination that we haven't seen for a while. Now, some of you may be wondering why I listed so many songs. I bought the deluxe album (which happens to be the same price as the reg. album) which included a few more songs, like Selene, The River, America and Round and Round. If you buy it on iTunes, you also get the song \\"Working Man\\" which is AWESOME.<br />Overall, I would rate this album a 9.5. The only reason it's not a ten is because a few of their songs are fillers, and don't add anything to the album. Can't wait for their second album, Monster, to come out!y just have that winning combination that we haven't seen for a while. Now, some of you may be wondering why I listed so many songs.

B00FKE3H0G|5.0|I must say that I was very impressed by Miley's new album!  I was immediately intrigued by the album title, the way she spelled Bangerz with a 'Z' instead of an 'S' was a stroke of sheer genius!  I like women when their makeup is done in homage to the late Heath Ledger from The Dark Knight, WOW!  The Explicit Lyrics sticker immediately told me I was holding serious art in my hands-she's not a little girl anymore!-and after I popped the disc into my computer, I was stunned by the virtuosity of the musicians she had handpicked for this project.  Miley's lyrics touched me deeply; I used to consider Bob Dylan the greatest songwriter of the last 50 years, but no more, Miley's gift for wordplay eclipses even The Bard himself. The amazing contributions from her featured artists were just the icing on the cake.  I plan to hold a series of informal listening parties where friends and loved ones can partake of Bangerz so we can spend the evening discussing what her artistry means to us and how it has changed our lives for the better.  Miley Cyrus is surely a gift to us all!<br /><br />P.S.-I wept when I wrote this review.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|The movie has good action scenes especially towards the ending where it really gets exciting to watch. There are scenes that are exciting to watch and others that keep you wanting to know what happens next but of course I won't put any spoilers. 5/5 from me, not too much to write because I'm not the best at reviews but if you loved the previous Iron Man movies, you'll love this one even more.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I will admit that I was not a fan of the reboot of Star Wars at first, but these movies have changed my mind. This was as good as the first. Telling the story of how Kirk and Spok and the orginal crew came together is really a good idea. J.J. Abrams has done great work making these movies and has assembled an excellent cast. I hope future movies, if there are any do not dissapoint.

From the moment I started reading this novel, I couldn't put it down.  The stories of the lives of the characters are engrossing and heart wrenching.  It was beautifully written and I loved it!  The author does an amazing job of describing the environment in which the characters live.  I felt I was there.  Captured me.
B000B5Y00U|5.0|How marvelous it is that RCA has dug into their treasure vault and reissued this recording!  We are indeed fortunate to once again hear three of the most sublime opera voices, Ms. Caballe and Messrs. Bergonzi and Milnes, captured in their vocal prime.  You'll have to search far and wide to find the roles of Violetta, Alfredo and Germont pere, more sensitively and commandingly sung.  Their combined vocal prowess is truly quite amazing and deserving of a hearty round of bravos and applause!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I like books that involve women who have issues and every woman in this novel has an issue or two.  It was a quick and easy read - enjoyed reading while on vacation.  I didn't really have to concentrate to hard to understand everything that was going on.  Sharp Objects was a fun read and the end did actually surprise me.  Looking forward to reading Flynn's other novels.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I should have looked into this game more before purchasing.  It feels like a game on Facebook where you have to go though a bunch of BS to play the game. This isn't a favorite of mine. Sorry Big Fish!
B008B8AOQI|5.0|Hadn't heard of this group until I saw the video. Fell in love with the sound, song and message. The entire album is filled with excellent music and timeless messages. The final tract punched with surprise! This album is not for head bangers but I can tell you my husband, who is dedicated to heavy metal, loved this album. I listen to it daily!
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|Man what is this crap? SMH. This is such a forced album.. I can believe anyone would by this garbage...
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I have read the Old Man's War series and enjoyed the series very much.  The reason I bought this book.  But this take on writing is different than that series.  More quirky, and more &#34;out there&#34; conceptually.  But being a great fan of science fiction, I found the humor and the digs against old TV shows to be quite amusing.  I also liked the coda endings.<br /><br />Well done!  I enjoyed quite a bit, even though it was not quite what I expected.
B00CKYHH6O|4.0|I've purchased TNG on VHS, Laser Disc, DVD, and now Blu-Ray. Each release on different media has been an improvement over the previous edition.  The Blu-Ray release is no different.  The video and sound is noticeably better than DVD.  However, there's some digital &#34;noise&#34; in the shadow details, so I'm guessing it's not a true High Definition remaster.  Will I buy the rest of the set as they are released on Blu-Ray?  Absolutely!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Yes at last we see Christian and Ana as a couple and also on equal footing. Oh wait... another bump in the road. This one nearly ends in tragedy but good will prevail over evil any day.<br /><br />Am happy to see these two have their happy ending. Good job E. L. James. It's been a long and worthy journey. Kudos.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Love this little game. Especially when I am gonna be in waiting room. Full charge and go go go.<br /><br />Awesome.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|A real page turner. I could not put this book down. I did not see the end coming all. I was totally intrigued with this story.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Being a lifelong fan of Star Trek (47 years). To me this was the absolute best Star Trek ever.<br />J.J. Abrams has accomplished something amazing with the help of great writing. They have<br />rebooted a franchise by taking new actors to play the iconic actors of the original series and<br />have almost flawlessly been able to maintain the standards of Gene Roddenberry in drawing<br />the emotions and intellects of the various cast members.  They also cast as the villain Benedict<br />Cumberbatch who is becoming one of the great actors of his generation as Kahn the greatest<br />villain of the Star Trek universe. This is quite simply movie making at it's best. It only bodes well<br />for what Abrams can bring to the Star Wars reboot that's coming.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Great game exciting not hard unless as u advance it become more difficult. But for now it is easy and colorful
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Worked out of the box and could not be happier. It is a well made product. I am overall pleased with the products put out by Google.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Is a classic and is a read for any fan of literature to have in their collection for years to come
0786956291|4.0|I like the original set more. Although this does do away with any cheating on character rolls. Just need to get used to it.
6302909651|3.0|Could not find it anywhere but found it on here. A thriller that will have you second guessing throughout the movie
0785814531|5.0|Its Poe, how can you go wrong. I will say its immense in size. So don't expect to carry it around.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Was a very long book but gets you into the mind of one of the most intriguing men to walk this earth,
B006PW0F52|3.0|It confirmed in writing what we all should admit consciously, but dont, that humans lie and cheat.<br />Lying is part of our DNA.  Just as a drive to believe in religion or other forces external to us is also in our DNA.
B001GAOY5U|5.0|It's a good clean fun movie for the whole family. Enjoyed the effects though I'm not a big 3D fan.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Just another way to play a favorite weekly tournament except I don't have to squint on my android to see it.  :-)
B004KA9VGA|5.0|I  loved this book and couldn't wait to read the next one, which I did almost immediately. Now I eagerly await the third in the series, which I hope won't be too long coming.<br />I can imagine the film this would make and can almost see the characters already.<br />There is another 'Twilight' in the air! (Can't ever be another Edward, who I imagined in the part, even if he doesn't have a dark complexion) so good luck whoever has to decide who plays Matthew.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone.<br />Judy
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Great access to FB but obviously not perfect in that it doesn't have the full functionality.  I actually find it easier to use on my android and prefer using it on my laptop, then on my android.
B00BEN0YP8|4.0|I would actually give &#34;Schindler's List&#34; four and a half stars out of five stars  as the story, (which may be repugnant to some people) is told very well, and the cinematography as well as the soundtrack, were also well done. .As  for the acting...EXCEPTIONAL... ALLTHE WAY AROUND...Although Liam Neeson is a favorite actor of mine, his breakdown into a blubbering &#34;little man or even child&#34; at the end is  the only detriment to the movie that I can see, I just can't see any &#34;German&#34; of the time,(no matter how remorseful for his, or her actions) to breakdown as Mr. Neeson did. Hence 41/2 stars not 5.
B00632HWOG|4.0|It's a great app, but it didn't get 5 stars because it's not as pretty and doesn't seem to have all of the same functions as it does on my laptop or desktop.  Functional and still worth recommending.
B005LAII1C|4.0|awesome funny and cool...best guy movie out there...i do not recommend for kids to watch this movie.. unrated really means not for under ages
B001BANK32|5.0|I already loved the book, but I had read it so long ago as a teen I forgot the meat of it.  I'm loving reading it on my Kindle Fire and in a way that doesn't exacerbate my pain issues (because the book itself was always so heavy).<br /><br />I forgot how important long backstory can be.  If you want to jump right into the scary action, well, this isn't that kind of book.  The early on parts of the book are still important and maybe they're scarier to me now and therefore will be more memorable because this time around I'm married and have children.  The book is already having more of an effect on me before they've even gotten to the hotel.  I guess my point is that it's scary still, but not for the same reasons it was 20 years ago.  And that's ok.  [It's because I have children now.  The emotional perspective of being a mother gives me a whole new perspective.  The emotional perspective of being a wife does too.<br /><br />I'll be honest about why I'm rereading it too... I think it's important because it's been so long since my last reading and I'm about to read the sequel Doctor Sleep.  I started reading Doctor Sleep and realized that I didn't remember quite enough of the original story to feel that I knew the characters well enough any more.  I couldn't connect as well with them and their experiences.]
B00FF5SXB8|1.0|The first 2 episodes of Agents of Shield were available on Amazon Instant on the morning after they had aired on ABC.<br />Both episodes arrived early wednesday morning.<br />It's now wednesday night and the 3rd episode isn't available yet on Amazon Instant.<br />It IS already available though on iTunes or on ABC.com (for free!).<br />So I am not sure what is causing the delay, but I am disappointed and will definitely consider switching to iTunes when buying my next TV show: comparable prices, but way earlier delivery.
B0079R8KXG|3.0|Did not keep tho I liked the itme, didn't realize until after I got it that I ordered wrong one.
1936608898|5.0|I don't know why I waited so long to order this book.  I think I figured that because I have been following a Paleo/Primal eating style for almost 2 years, there couldn't possibly be any new information.  I was wrong.  There were plenty of new concepts for me to digest, and the way in which they were delivered caused many a &#34;light bulb&#34; moment for me.  Well researched, lots of tough love, geeky science (yes!) broken down for the average joe.  I simply loved it!
B00DCX08MW|5.0|Closest you can get to real thing on a tablet. Very much like emergency landing game. I only wish there were more free levels.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Everyone needs to see this movie.  Pele should know where their food comes from.  Wake up!!!  Your very life is at stake.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun game very challenging but a whole lot of fun to play keeps you busy for hours can't wait to check out more.
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|Great sound! I listen to this in my truck and its just awesome! Hearing the recorded and the live tracks is pure heaven.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I can't put it down just have to make my town bigger larger the way I want it, about to go play it now since I talked about it!!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game takes me back to my childhood going with Grandma and her sisters to a school cafeteria (which was really Smokey then)to play bingo always closing out the night with blackout. It is a great escape for a few minutes or longer.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is one of the most useful apps. It is so easy to use and accurate and includes a lot of helpful information that helps to project what activities remain possible on battery. Recommended!!
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|I like the heaviness of the album.  Ironically my favorite song so far is \\"Lover\\".  Probably the least heavy song of the whole album.  I also like the sound of the drums.  The tom-toms are much more resonant.  I noticed Scott Phillips doesn't do his hi-hat trick with the ride cymbal during the chorus like all of the previous albums (including Creed).  I was really surprised and glad; being that he always did it in every song.  I know I sound strange, but I just notice things like that.<br /><br />Anyway, the album rocks!  It stands out from the previous albums.  It gives Alter Bridge some diversity.  Plus, I'm sure Mark is happy that he could throw in a lot more heavy riffs; being that his favorite bands are pretty much in the Metal genre.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|I rented this film solely for Leonardo DiCaprio and he did not disappoint. I had seen the 70's version with Robert Redford. Redford is a brilliant actor, but the film he starred in was dull and awful. Mia Farrow as Daisy was terrible. So I was a bit tense about renting the new version with Leo and Carey. All for nothing because the film was brilliant. Baz did such a great job directing it. The actors in this film were brilliant. The music in the film was beautiful as well, although I wasn't too fond of the rap music in between some scenes, but that's ok. It wasn't over bearing. Lana Del Rey's \\"Young and Beautiful\\" song was placed on several scenes in different version and it brought me to tears at some points. Even though I knew that Jay Gatsby would die in the end of the film, I was still bawling like a baby. That's the power of Leo's acting. I didn't even react when Redford's version died. Anyway, the film was gorgeous. A million times better then the 74' version, that's for sure.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I enjoyed this book greatly, not just because I can relate to it on a number of obvious levels: I'm close to the author's age; like her, I grew up in Minnesota, with roots in the north country, and now live in Portland; and I've done quite a bit of my own solo outdoor adventuring over the years (though nothing as ambitious as hiking half the PCT).<br /><br />I read lots of adventure books and would have enjoyed Wild for the above things alone, but I was really struck by her brutal honesty about her own shortcomings, mistakes and foibles.  Some of the things she does, both trail and in her personal life, are absolutely cringe-inducing, things that most people would not even admit to their close friends.  But it makes her seem more real and human.  Who hasn't plunged into something big without doing all the research at least once, and who hasn't had a time when they strayed from the path and screwed themselves up for a while?  Strayed weaves all the threads together in this brilliant portrait of a young adult struggling through some tough issues and sorting out who she really is. This book was obviously a labor of love, something she'd turned over in her head for many years before finally writing, and the result is a masterpiece.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Love this movie. 3D version is great along with extras.  Can't wait for the next movie to come out.  Enjoy.
B00130VLZ4|4.0|Well designed, but too expensive. Given no other options, you pay the price. Using my camara much more now. Good product.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My boys got me this game and I love it. I have had so much entertainment on a cellular device game ever.  Please keep adding vehicles and places. Thanks
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What an interesting point of view. It almost turned me off but I'm so glad I stuck it out. Once I figured out what was going on it sucked me in completely!!!<br />It dawned on me that this is the opposite of The Anne Frank story. What a great look at the war through a little girls eyes!
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Have loved Iz's recording of Over the Rainbow for years and finally found out who recorded it.  I've nearly worn the track out playing it 3-4 times a day during my drives to/from work. So sorry he is no longer with us.  The entire album is soothing and I listen to it constantly, but Over the Rainbow and Wonderful World are both over the rainbox and wonderful.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Everything about this book makes me want my own Christian grey!! I can't wait to read more books by EL James
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|A surprisingly good game. It gets a bit repetitive but since it is kicking your butt you keep playing. HINT: hold on to your blue diamonds (I so 8). Enjoy the flights!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A great  \\"what if\\" dystopian novel. Even better with th  idea of not really knowing how it could happen and what may become of humankind if it did happen.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Keeps the mind fresh! Helps your creativity. Problem solving skills are key in life! I beat all the challenges, but my nephew erased all my Kindle apps one day, so I had to reinstall. It's like starting over again - SO FUN! And they added more! Thanks!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast works great; super easy to set up.  Will be even better once Google strikes deals with more content providers.  But, for now, works a lot better than an HDMI cable ... for not much more money!
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I found this  book very good,  it keep my interest .<br /><br />Would give it 4 stars and looking forward to more .
B000FVE3AC|5.0|I just bought my second one from Amamzon because it is one of the best watches you can buy for that price.It is big and heavy, but that is the way I like it, I do not like small watches. I have use it for diving several times already and it works perfectly. The first one I got, I bought it about six years ago and still running smooth and sharp. I love the fact that it is automatic because I hate to change batteries. No to many automatic watches around this price are found in the market that runs as well as this one, at least I have not found any. For the price of this watch, you are geting the best. It is definitelly a good deal !!!!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I LOVE this show on Netflix. I watched the entire thing in about 3 days. I did not know that it was based on a book, and when I learned that, I knew I had to read it.<br /><br />There are a LOT of differences between the show and the book, but I was expecting that. The book has a lot less drama, but it's more...informational? It was very interesting to read about a woman's year in prison. She sounds like many of my friends, she sounded like ME at some times. It made me wonder how I'd do in prison. It put me in her shoes--her steel-toed work shoes, her plastic shower shoes--it resonated with me. I found that to be powerful, because I'm a 24-year-old girl from the suburban Metro Detroit area. I've never been a drug mule, I've never gotten into trouble with the law, and this made me feel like I very well could have been.<br /><br />I give this book 5 stars and would recommend it to anyone. It's insightful, it is interesting, and it makes you really think.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wonderful, if brutal, sci-fi mystery.  Keeps you guessing - and unsure of the fate of characters you have grown to love.
B009X2CVXA|4.0|I loved this book, it really got into my head and I often found myself thinking about it during the day, wanting to be able to read it more often.  A wonderfully woven story to keep you guessing.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|It has many available location options as to where it can report my local weather from geographically. Not to sure how clear that statement made things. In essence, my city has several locations that report weather conditions to whatever service this app uses. For example, I can choose for it to report the weather from the military base helicopter pad or the local hospital or just the city temperature not associated with a more specific location. Other communities may not have more than one option though. It also has forecasts for several days broken down by the hour. The app functions well on my Nook HD+.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was perfectly written. I LOVED it so much. The memories made me happy and the present made me cry. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Awesome! Worth the money. Best anniversary gift ever. Great sound quality, great look, cool case and the best gift ever.
0385349947|5.0|Our book club was reading this, many young women mixed with older ones. It was interesting to discuss the differences from those at the beginning of their lives and those who have been around the block.  While SS had extraordinary abilities and networking possibilities that most do not have, her stories to illustrate points are very useful.  You don't know what you don't know and you just have to keep plugging forward and essentially brazen it out when there are \\"female\\" issues.  As a very upper class woman who hired help and was able to negotiate her schedule somewhat, many don't have the options she did and I do think she recognizes that but glosses over it.  Her point, which is valid, is to keep moving, laterally or upwards on the jungle gym. Just keep juggling the balls, it is worth it.  If you are working in the \\"knowledge\\" industries that are changing, this is more possible than in many jobs. Her methods for dealing with people was interesting and there are some good techniques can work for everyone.  Yes, I am passing this book along to family and friends.
B0082Z447U|5.0|Extraordinary Book!<br /><br />I don't know how this book escaped me all these years (and me...an English major!) but I am so glad I finally got to it. Written in 1859, this is the type of mystery-thriller that isn't attempted anymore. It is a complex and detailed story that combines nefarious and mysterious behavior while ultimately proving that love conquers all.<br /><br />This is the story of Walter Hartright, a common artist who finds a woman in dressed in white on a solitary London road at midnight, begging for his help. It describes the quagmire Walter falls into because of his kindness to this woman -- a quagmire that takes him across the land to uncover the mystery of the woman in white. Along the way, he encounters an evil count, a greedy baronet, a beautiful lookalike, a handsome older sister and many other intriguing characters.<br /><br />It's long and involved, sometimes convoluted, with a large cast of characters and lots of moving pieces...but everything works with a rhythm that hums perfectly from page 1 all the way to the end. And, even if you think a character or an action will have no bearing on the story, think again! Considered one of literature's first mystery novels, Wilkie Collins carefully plotted and planned each movement of every character so all the puzzle pieces coalesce into a perfect whole.<br /><br />It's exciting and fun, somewhat challenging to read at times, but well worth the effort.<br /><br />If you love mysteries, if you love villains, if you love love...you'll love The Woman in White.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Buck springs to life like no other. He learns the brutality of man and beast, adopts, and flourishes in a world set apart. London creates for the reader a longing to run with pack living life to its fullest.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game. However,it would be better if you did not lose character's and keys with each update. I am enjoying the world tour.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device works seamlessly with my setup from tablet to computer to phone. Love how easy and little to no setup is needed. Recommend setting it up on the computer first
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|this was the most interesting of the series, so far the characters are well acted and this movie has the essence of the original.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|God Bless this girl and her child.  I hate what happened to her, but I couldn't help but read as it is told by her.  I pray that she finds peace and happines..
B000ZELISO|5.0|This was the only DVD I was missing from the Harry Potter collection. It came on time , the packaging was good and there was no damage. I have viewed it several times and the quality is great.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This would be great for someone without arthritis.  I tried it and finished it only once due to my condition.  I did lose weight and tone up and would recommend to anyone without physical limitations.
B005COO1X6|2.0|I love Stephen King; however I just could not get into this book.  I cannot even remember the premise behind it.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I have read all five in this series, and the first three in the follow-up series. Loved each one, but only really liked this one. I dislike the adding of a new Satyr and bumping out of Grover. I get that Riordan wanted a bossy authority figure, just wished that he had gone a different route than Hedge. On the flip-side, putting Grover with Jason would have made Jason seem more like a Percy V2.0 as opposed to a stand-alone character. The hardened Anabeth is a great twist with her character, it seems like she aged 5 years since the finale of the first series, and not in a bad way. I already knew the new characters from the supplimentary book that preceded this one, otherwise, I may not have taken to them the way I did. My favorite character in this one had to be Festus. Especially after meeting him in the prequel. Pretty good book, same awesome Riordan style here. My only true found negative here is the lack of Percy. Some readers may have enjoyed the Percy-break, I just wasn't one of them.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book.  I was born in 1963 and have always been fascinated by JFK so this was a great read for me.  I really hope this one is made into a movie.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|A book that expands beyond all generations. A novel to remind us about the gift of humanity and the importance of living a full life and not taking for granted the choices we make.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|I am one of the few who find this book unappealing.  I do not like the premise of hurting the children or making the children fight for their lives.  Everyone I know loves it, but I found it barbaric.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Love it. It's a great way to spend your free time! I play all the time with no troubles whatsoever!
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|It was a really good movie.  We watched it 3 times in the 24hr. period I had rented it for.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Great adventure game and graphics. Hard to put down. I hope more games of this kind come out. Let the adventure continue..........
B00594XOZU|1.0|I really like this app but it sucks that apparently no one can log in. If possible can this be fixed soon please?
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|A very addicting game, beware! But a lot of fun and in its own right. The only thing I wish is that they award you some diamonds when you win some games, once in awhile. A very good game, everyone should try it out at least once.
B000002GOZ|5.0|Totally awesome CD.....Best one I have, by far!!!!!  You will have a new favorite....Bryan Adams and Keith Scott are the best ever!!!
B005LAII3U|5.0|the story, plot twists, settings are all exciting and different from the original film by Arnold. I actually thought it's a remake with different actors. but regardless, it's still good. best of all, the 2 female leads are hot!
B001974DG0|5.0|Thats really about ALL I can say. I have read over thirty of his books and, this one remains MY personal favorite.<br /><br />We all humanize our pets. We can't help it. We dream about how it would be if our sweet dogs, cats and other pets could communicate with us, putting their own unique spin on life, and helping us get through it maybe a bit less scathed. To know that when you told your pet that you loved it, that you were hurting, confused, or just needed that unconditional love from them, and they understood you, would be one step away from heaven.  Unfortunately, that is not to be on this Earth. Maybe in the next one.<br /><br />So here's the next best thing. This book, with its beauty, its horror, its fear and its grace, will touch you in a way you won't expect. Better get out your Kleenex.
1936891026|3.0|Kinda goes off on tangents at times, makes fun of someone he saw in traffic with tinted windows listening to a style of music he disliked. Thought that was petty and irrelevant. Overall not bad, some chapters seem like filler though. Would still recommend
B003G4W49C|5.0|It's so thrilling to read a novel that is current but a complete classic. This writhing is reminiscent of Ray Bradbury but with the\\"Ahhh HA\\" factor of Arthur C Clarke. Love love LOVE this book!!!
1444710338|5.0|Lost 12 pounds the first 10 days. Love the diet and would recommend this to everyone. After my friends and family saw what I lost they bought the book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I'm pretty upset. I was on level 23 had about.. 20,000 dollars.. 2 people got sick from disasters and I didn't wanna see them die so I uninstalled it. dude stop making those storms!  itleast make them easier to fix itleast..
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|Fun game! But i Need more neighbors. Add me! Farm id: FASLKYX. Long wait times on crops but otherwise cool game.
0345541588|5.0|i love this writer!  no one beats Jack Reacher...Lee Child can't write these books fast enough for me!  read this series.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|I've had the product for about 6 months. I use two mice...one charging and one in use. Everything works perfectly. When one runs out of juice I take the charged mouse off of the charger and place the drained mouse on it to charge. I read the other reviews and can honestly say that I have had none of those negative experiences. I would recommend (and have) this product to anyone who wishes to avoid the \\"dead mouse\\" syndrome...
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I know the product is limited but I expected it to be tolerable.<br />Unless you like lipsync to be off and other problems, it can hardly be used with the chrome browser on a laptop like my Macbook. The same can be said for my Linux laptop,<br />It works OK when controlled through my Android phone and through my wife's Ipad but it is a hassle.. My guess is that software updates might cure these problems but I'm surprised at the poor basic functionality.
079284131X|1.0|I had this DVD when their was no other version of the movie available to get in widescreen format. Luckily, I got a Blu-ray player in late 2009, and picked up the Blu-ray DVD combo pack. It was worth the wait, and I immediately gave this as a gift to my brother for some of his Christmas DVD's I gave him. He had a full screen tv at the time, so he was ok with this version I guess. Don't waste your money on this one folks. This version looks and sounds terrible. A VHS of this movie will be exactly the same. Get the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack even if you only have a DVD player. It comes with Chucky's 20th Birthday Edition DVD in widescreen format. You will be much happier than this stinker of a DVD that MGM put out for 1999.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|The main problem that &#34;The Pacific&#34; has is that everyone will compare it to Band of Brothers.  It is not nearly as interesting or compelling.  I guess though, if one thinks of it in isolation, it's a pretty good war story,  obviously graphic.  The producers felt they had to throw in some sex scenes.  This is truly a case where the books that the movie is based on are better.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read this book, right now!!!<br /><br />Reading this book is like working on a 1000 piece puzzle where someone holds all the pieces and the picture and they toss you like 5 or 10 random pieces at a time. They don't even connect to each other in the beginning and you're trying to make a puzzle out of pieces and you don't know what the picture is. As you get more pieces, more of the puzzle fills in and you see more of the picture which just motivates you to continue reading to get more pieces.<br /><br />THIS BOOK IS SO FULL OF AWESOME, I CAN NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!!!!
B008GGA5EQ|5.0|As the protagonist leaves her mundane life of conformity, her publishing house job, and confining office outfits, she yearns for an adventure. She wants to feel awake and alive, not \\"like a clone among clones\\" stuck with her London job, predictable friends, and an unimaginative boyfriend. Her senses are dulled, and her emotions are flat. Her life has no pleasure nor pain. She feels nothing and is ready to trade that kind of stifling existence for anything different. Any sensation, even the physical pain or sexual humiliation, would be a vast improvement over the nothingness that she feels in her civilized life. As she sheds her clothes and her inhibitions, she develops a new identity and learns to feel again, both pain and pleasure, and myriad of sensations that come in-between.  To me, the need to escape the mundane, at any cost, was one of the most powerful ideas in the book. If you have never experienced life that was so confining that it left you feeling emotionally, mentally, and physically dead, you are lucky, and this idea might not hit home with you.  But for those of us who were at some point in life stuck neck-deep in infinite boredom, her yearning to escape that life, at any cost, doesn't seem that far-fetched.<br /><br />The book is extremely well-written, with vivid settings, sensual descriptions of exotic belly-dancers, flavorful foods and drinks, the smells, the sounds, and the tastes of distant oceans, uninhabited islands, and the mesmerizing Sahara desert. All the different cultures described and the foreign languages spoken in the book add to the excitement and the suspense. The way the protagonist adjusts her Western identity to these foreign and exotic circumstances is fascinating to read about.<br /><br />And just a reminder to those readers who wonder whether what the men do to the girl in the book is legal,  whether the book promotes sex trade, sends the message to men that women want to be raped and abused, etc., etc., please remember that this is fiction, erotica, and fantasy, not a political or a social statement. The ultimate loss of control and sexual surrender that this book portrays is appealing to women who are busy, on schedule, and very much in control in their real lives. It's a wild escape from reality and a fun reminder that there's a sensual side to life that is often forgotten among errands.  And you don't have to travel to an exotic island to have these experiences. But it wouldn't hurt. Or maybe, it would, judging by what happened in the novel, but the experience might still be worth it.is is fiction, erotica, and fantasy, not a political or a social statement.

B00DXP7L88|2.0|WARNING: SPOILERS<br /><br />I would have given this last season of Dexter one star, but out of respect for the series as a whole, I gave it two.  I loved this series!  I watched faithfully and never missed an episode.  And when I heard this was the last season, I was so hoping that the writers would come up with a spectacular ending (not necessarily happy, but something suitably jaw dropping).  What a disappointment!!  This season (to put it in a word) STUNK!  The pace was unbelievably slow and monotonous;  you thought, surely, surely, the writers were just building up to a grand finale - but then the finale came and it was not grand, or jaw dropping.<br /><br />The writing was weak, the interaction between the characters was weak.  It was like the writers just gave up and went on auto-pilot.  The bad guy of the season, the Brain Surgeon, should have been Dexter's greatest challenge - ending with an antagonist that he either couldn't beat, or gave his life trying to beat (which would have been a great ending).  But the Brain Surgeon wasn't scary, wasn't a great challenge, and really did nothing for the character development of Dexter.  While the writers were trying to tie up all the loose ends, they brought back Hannah (a decision by the writers I thought questionable), but then did nothing interesting with her character.  They killed off Deborah - in a most unspectacular, ho-hum way.  And the final straw was the ending...Dexter as lumberjack, WTH?!<br /><br />I could go on and on about how bad this season was.  Short story is, the writers took a brilliant series and butchered, just butchered, the ending.  It was so bad, I'm not even going to purchase this season on Blu-ray (I have purchased every other season)...I'm just going to pretend that this season never happened.
B008Y212PI|5.0|What a great game! Fun for every skill level! I went through the small puzzles very quickly. As I got to the bigger puzzles, it took a little longer. Great game!
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is really addicting.  I love puzzle games, and this one is great!  I will buy more when I have done these puzzles.
B003M8NG94|3.0|As a bid sci fi fan I was interested in Mars Attacks. It has its moments and has some fun to it. But in terms of offering new sci fi ideas it was lacking. It is fun so I will not trash it.
B005LAIIGW|4.0|The critics are all over this movie. Many of them have seen it 2 or 3 times which is saying something. I liked it a lot, but, now that I've calmed down, separating the movie form the experience has proven challenging.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. There's a space shuttle mission in space. The Russian's have blown up one of their satellites and the ensuing metal storm is taking out everything in its path. Next thing you know, the space shuttle and all the crew save for Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are dead. They now must fight to survive and make it back to mama earth.<br /><br />This is a remarkable effort. I had the pleasure of seeing it in Imax 3-D (a first for me) and you feel as though you're in outer space with them. I've seen any number of sci-fi movies set in space but this tops them all in driving home the the sense of expanse, quiet menace, no sense of up or down and zero room for screwing up. The story is good enough. It's a 'Murphy's Law' scenario where one bad thing leads to another right up to the final breath stealing moment. Like \\"Apollo 13\\" you have people in peril in outer space. As good as \\"Apollo 13\\" is, this tops it on the tech side. SO much attention is paid to detail here. Small things, like seeing the various reflections in the visors of Clooney and Bullock. Bullock's tears floating away from her face as she thinks all is lost. There are a million little things like that that would take repeat viewings to pull in. Bullock is her usual good self here and she comprises a lion's share of the time. But the kudos have to go to director Alfonso Cuaron. He has a remarkable vision here and managed it with near flawlessness. His \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is one of the best in the series. And his \\"Children of Men\\" is one of my all time favorite films. I can't wait to see what he does next.<br /><br />Like I said. The story is good enough, but it needs to be seen for the sheer level of achievement. Few movies come along that shake you to your bones like this does. If you still want to reclaim a lost sense of wonderment, this should do it for you.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|The movie is very well done and well acted. My only problem The Story. Why did  this great sci fi franchise have to go back and do another story about Khan. In this great Unioverse of ours,which spans billions of light years or more why go into a story that has been done twice already. How about some new speculation about what this great and very large Universe of our might have to offer?
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Provocative , scenic and interesting. I do not like to be forced to write twenty words. That why I don't fill out these surveys!!!!
B00FFHG6KQ|1.0|A horrible game terrible graphics, and game play. Also the songs always switch even if they didn't end. Multiseoson is horrible trade override is always on. So DON'T BUY THIS BUY nba jam it's better, even if the teams aren't updated.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|The plot of this book is captivating, with its numerous twists and turns that keep the reader glued to the text. The characters are vivid, and the story fast paced, both of which make for a very enjoyable read. As pointed out in the newspaper review, the plot is very similar to Stieg Larsson's great trilogy. If you are looking for a fascinating, well crafted story, this is it.
B00C28J2VQ|4.0|This is one of those that people seem to be on the fence about. I remember when I heard about John Carter and how it was a horrid movie. Weel I bought it cheap and found to be a very enjoyable movie. Same applies to GI Joe....the 3d is solid - action is great. Yes there are several bits that are over the top but it was still a good watch.<br /> It has good replay value....unlike the Life of Pi that so many people were ranting about how awesome it was....it was a good show but not something that has any replay value. GI Joe is something the kids have seen several times...I have only seen it once so far.<br /> For my taste in movies this was good enough that I hope there is a 3rd installment and its a solid buy around the 20 dollar mark.<br /> I can not tell you anymore that countless other reviewers have not already covered.
0399247459|5.0|Wonderful addition to the kids library!  Great book for 3 year old and 6 year old to read to her as well.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|My favorite movie, that I used to own, let someone borrow it, never saw it again!  She could sing, act, but just couldn't get straight.
0316204366|5.0|Purely Gladwell. David and Goliath starts off with the Biblical account of the drama but a different twist is put on not only how the duel ended but why it ended in the way that it did. Within the first chapters you find that bigger or best is not always the route to travel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|IM IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME ITS SOOOO FUN ITS LIKE TEMPLE RUN BUT WAY FUNNER THIS GAME IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!
B0089LOKHG|3.0|The ending felt unresolved... I feel like it just stopped in the middle of the book! It was just getting good***
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|I enjoy the game except for having to start at level one each time you begin to play. It is irritating
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Absolutely breathtaking!!! Best book out of the trilogy!!! Couldn't have been happier with how it ends! Love love love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game gets me zoomed in right away and keeps me there i love it i recommend it for everyone who likes any kind of game.
B0089LOG02|4.0|It is refreshing to read about people who have gone through such terrible times and come out the other side--scarred but seemingly whole. I also enjoyed how Molly and Vivian helped each other. As a genealogist, I am fascinated by the orphan trains and the people on them.
B008YW5RH2|2.0|Not a bad game it's a little unrealistic but if  you have time to play for a long time I would recommend it.cause you need time to earn balls so u can move on
B007SGM084|3.0|I chose this book because of all the media attention it has received. It was interesting, although parts of it bored me a little, such as in the second book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is the best game ever. It is better than all the gamed in the world put together times a infinity and beyond
0399159347|2.0|The book is an easy read, and I got through it quickly.  However, I felt as though the characters were very shallow and unbelievable, almost caricatures.  Even as the plot thickens, I still did not care much for any of them, or for that matter, their struggles.  The \\"bombshell\\" of the story comes close to 1/3 of the way through, though I figured it out much earlier.  There are three separate stories that are at play, but I did not see the purpose of the Tess story as it related to the other two.  I suppose there are some good \\"What would you do?\\" issues in the book that could lend themselves to interesting book club discussions. While I hate the expression \\"chick lit,\\" this book is a perfect example of it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|There some what of bug glitch thing. Nothing big or any thing. It's just that when u go to the character shop on king' s count outfit there are lines all over him from making the new 3d outfit. I'm sure they will fix it. Anyways great game.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|One of my all-time favorite records. I've played it when it isn't even Christmas. Wonderful interpretations of familiar carols, and several unfamiliar ones have become favorites. Christmas carols can be so limp and lifeless-- but Lennox brings real power and feeling to these. A great record by one of the very best talents of our time.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Setup was easy peasy, and the now I can fire up the PC from my couch and enjoy the web vids on tv, all controlled from my Blackberry Torch!<br /><br />Great device!!!!<br /><br />c
B00785P2QC|5.0|A Commended game to pass time.  For free you can not beat itself.  Good deal at twice the price.  Buy it.
B00BH0VSM6|1.0|I was kind of in to the story until I got to the part where a character criticized the American interest in movie star Mel Gibson, excoriating us I suppose because of his much publicized drunken escapades involving anti-Semitic rants among other things.  Yeah, Mel is probably a jerk, but I do not accept him as symptomatic of American cultural decline, or whatever.  I am sick of political diatribes in novels, particularly when issued by Europeans from small countries ( which I am sure also contain drunks who make fools of themselves) with a homogenous citizenry.  He needs to write an editorial for the NY Times if this is an issue for him- they would love to hear from him.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Daughter loved it as a gift.  She always watched the series and we were among the first to see the movie.
B009PMEEY2|2.0|Played for about 20 minutes. Seemed fun. Pretty much the same as similar games. Have not been able to open since so only 2 stars since it doesnt work
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very cute, relaxing light reading.  Same love story with romance only after the marriage.  Nice twist of the normal romance book.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|These movies are the best thing ever.  I always enjoyed Star Trek, and the new movies out just don't capture the essence of the originals.  This complete set will keep the old Star Trek fresh.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|Daughter loved it as a gift.  She always watched the series and we were among the first to see the movie.
B000056BOR|5.0|Cary Grant is always good and teamed with Doris Day he is wonderful.  He's a rich man and she's a working girl trying to impress him, but as usual for Doris Day, things don't always work out at first, but always a happy ending.  A wonderfully entertaining movie and one to add to any collection.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Omg I looooooooove this app it is so fun and my sister's love it to it deserves 200,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars but that's not an option
B0040I09RM|5.0|The pilot had me hooked from the opening scene. It only took a few days to catch up to season 6.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|This movie was very different than I expected. Sandra was at her best. The guy that played the main foot ball player I had never seen, but he played a good part. This movie is clean fun and very enjoyable.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Great game, allows you to build your own village.  Great game for the kids. I would  recommend that you spend  some e time with this game.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|FRACTURE (USA/Germany-2007 is one of my favorite Anthony Hopkins movies, one in which he's a calculating, cold-blooded killer who plays an elaborate courtroom game with hotshot Asst. DA Ryan Gosling.<br /><br />Knowing his younger wife is having an affair with a police detective, Hopkins awaits her arrival home and shoots her in the left cheek. The bullet travels through her brain and lodges against the skull, but she doesn't die.<br /><br />The cop boyfriend arrives to investigate a reported shooting, not realizing who the victim is. Naturally he's upset when he sees his lover lying near death. Hopkins cooly admits to shooting her, has the weapon nearby. At the police station he willingly signs a confession.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Gosling is a lawyer on the way up. He likes nothing better than to win in court, and his 97% success rate shows he's good at it. After destroying in trial the case of a top-notch defense attorney, Gosling is hired by the loser's law firm, the most prestigious in L.A. He's given his two weeks notice at the DA's office, but has a chance to rack up another courtroom victory before leaving the City's employ, an open-and-shut case of a man who's confessed to the attempted murder of his spouse.<br /><br />Hopkins takes legal procedures in a most cavalier manner, even acts as his own lawyer. At one point before the trial he offers Gosling a great deal of cash if he will defend him, with a warning that things will become messy if he remains prosecutor. These words of caution go unheeded by the young DA who has, in his mind, already moved on to a new career with that big money firm. Besides, this case is a slam dunk, right? He's got the weapon, a verbal confession and a signed one. The trial will be over before it starts.... or will it?

159514188X|2.0|\\"No one knows for certain how much impact they have on the lives of other people.\\"<br /><br />A shoebox of cassette tapes arrives at Clay's home.  As he starts to listen to them, he hears the voice of Hannah Baker, a girl who committed suicide, and learns the 13 reasons why she decided to take her life.<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong: suicide is a SERIOUS subject.  It's also a very REAL problem, particularly in conjunction with bullying, slut-shaming, coming out, religious differences, etc.  It is not to be trivialized.  Unfortunately, in many ways, I think that's what \\"13 Reasons\\" did.  It trivialized Hannah's suicide.  Just like I did when I was a teenager (I was in tears when I broke my Mom's ceramic cookie jar lid - she didn't care much at all!), Hannah blew some of her situations out of proportion.  People have gone through a lot worse and didn't choose to commit suicide; why Hannah chose to let some of these incidents affect her so badly is hard to understand.<br /><br />And that is the biggest reason why I don't like \\"13 Reasons\\".<br /><br />The other biggest reason is Hannah's cowardly reaction to a rape that she observes - after whinging for 200 pages about all the horrible things people have done to her, she then cowers in a corner as a boy rapes a drunk girl.  After the horrendous actions in Stubenville, Ohio, where a virtually identical case happened, it's kinda hard to have sympathy for a girl who sees something wrong and doesn't say anything.<br /><br />Oh, and Clay as our Main Character - not a fan.  Just so you don't think I'm playing a sexist, I thought he was a pretty overdramatic character too - of course, part of that could be because we hear Hannah's thoughts and then read Clay's actions or thoughts the next paragraph, making his every action MELODRAMATIC.  But other than to give us some eyes to see the events through, why was he here?  On the freakin' tapes, Hannah herself says he really didn't belong as he hadn't done anything wrong to her - oh, how convenient!  Our Marty Stu is there to fret over her and clutch his head in agony, but no worries, he didn't do anything deserving of guilt!  Good thing too - would hate to have to live with actual guilt!<br /><br />I can see where the author was trying to put an emphasis on how our actions, purposeful or accidental, can have unrealized responses to another.  I also appreciate how slut-shaming and sexism was addressed.  And I do think that this message book has some good messages for teenagers.  But how the message was delivered, the reasons for Hannah's suicide and how she blamed people for what ultimately is her choice (and didn't take blame for being complicit in another girl's rape) make this book \\"not for me\\".<br /><br />Some people will probably read this review and go, \\"You are victim blaming!  How dare you!\\"  That is NOT my purpose; I don't mean to victim blame Hannah.  If she were a real person, I would accept her reasons, even if I didn't agree with them.  But when a FICTIONAL CHARACTER records 7 cassette tapes of Blame Game, blaming everyone but herself for her decision, send these to the people who Done You Wrong, how can you expect me to think anything but that the character is being overdramatic?<br /><br />In review - I'm not that impressed by the book.  I think there are better Message Books out there that handle this topic.  Do I think it should be banned?  Absolutely not - there IS a good message here, one that some teens will appreciate and need.  But as for me - yeah, it's not my thing.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

It, however, received a one star reduction because of its lack of applications that are supported.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Worked as advertised, easy to install, had it up and running in about five minutes. I highly recommend it. I am getting another for my kids.
B00337KM2S|4.0|Though the film's title and plot is all about flying and the lifestyle that comes with it, it has a plot that is firmly grounded and therefore enjoyable to watch.  Of course, George Clooney is easy on the eyes.  But Mr. Clooney once again showcases his abilities as an actor, playing a man who allows his life to revolve around his travels and is happy because of it.  But his belief system, which he incorperates into his motivational speeches, is challenged by the arrival of an ambitious new colleague and a fellow traveler who might just be more than that.  I'll readily admit that I've never heard of Anna Kendrick before this film but that she impressed me in this film and I look forward to seeing more of her work.  It's amusing to watch her question the way of life held dear by Mr. Clooney's character, wondering if there isn't another way while silmaltaniously derailing the status-quo with her own ideas.  Vera Farmiga, who came to the audience's attention just three years earlier in \\"The Departed\\", brings a new role as she seems to be even more invested in Mr. Clooney's way of living than even Mr. Clooney.  This film is interesting as it thankfully never truely preaches in favor of one life or another but instead just shows us the pros and cons of different points of view, leaving it to us to make that ultimate decision.  I definetly recommend it to anyone who likes movies, flying, or George Clooney.  Enjoy.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|It is very easy to use and saves you time from waiting for the weather channel to report on your location.  I really like the feature of being able to save several locations. Well worth the money.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|The front man for Genesis after Peter Gabriel's departure. And he had one hit after another as a solo artist. Great album.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Excellent as always. Great characters. Great stories. Great writing. All this equals, great writer. Love his books. Leaves me wanting more.
B004AQR29C|4.0|Sylvester Stallone and an ALL STAR cast of mostly out of work action actors, with a very typical easy to figure out plot. A lot of bloodshed, a lot of humor, a lot of fun. It's well worth watching if your in to action flicks.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Does everything I want it too. Stays rather clean for being clear. Isn't hard plastic so it absorbs any hard drops of scratches. Couldn't be happier.
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|If you like Genesis, you'll want this if you don't already own every album. This pretty much has them all.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME AND THEE MOVIE 5 STARS! GET IT GET IT NOW! ITS GREAT! YOU MUST GET IT IT IS AWESOME!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Is a good game. 5x5 is really easy though.  Have not had a chance to go any higher yet.<br /><br />Recommend this game.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|Re-reading this after almost 40 years brings back a lot of memories, and now I am sharing the excitement and experience with my two boys (6 and 10) and they are loving it.  Definitely one of The Great Books, in my opinion.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is a little slow but all in all fun. Just need to be able to gain money and gems faster.
B00594XOZU|2.0|This app is generally amazing. I have it on all of my other devices. I don't understand why, but every since I updated it, it always says 'This is taking longer than it should. Please try again in a bit.' I've tried uninstalling it then reinstalling it again, but it still doesn't work. I don't know what else to do. I've tried for the past week!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Game is fun takes a while to level up though, and its expensive point wise to demolish or modify territory.
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|Hey ,there i want to tell you that this game is so fun and addicting and you can play in multiplayer and in campain !!!in this game you have infinite missions of attacks and constructions.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game butt updates are needed and If your buying this game it's worth the $ and its better in 8.0.8 no bugs or anything and  you can also play with friends!!!!!!!
B008OHV5W8|2.0|Looking at the CD cover I kind of thought the music would be a little more dense and layered and like they say, world music style.  Instead, each track sounded essentially the same, although each track is mostly by a different artist.  I have to admit I bought it without giving a listen--if I'd taken the time to do so I would have realized that this one is just not for me.  I'm sure many people will enjoy it--it's all very calm and quiet and reflective, but musically not very interesting at all.  IMO!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The title explains every thing needed to be said. It's easily the best book of the trilogy. I just am so sad yet relieved to have finished this book.

0425266060|5.0|Love these books, they are very hard to put down! I read all 3 in 4 days! After reading all of the Fifty shades, I would say the Crossfire series are better. Eva and Gideon have a tasteful romantic relationship. I would definitely recommend these books to just about anyone who likes romance novels. I cannot wait for the 4th one to come out!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book made me happy and then sad and then I would cry, but it's still one of the best books I've ever read
B000XR4OC0|2.0|I bought my first pair of Toms (Grey Canvas, Size 6) at Nordstorm about a year ago and I love them.  They are so comfy and lightweight.<br /><br />I ordered a pair of navy canvas, size 6 shoes (same shoe) and opened them at work and threw away the box so it would be recycled and I could just carry the bag w/shoes home.<br /><br />BIG MISTAKE.  The exact same shoe in the same exact size is now about an ENTIRE SIZE TOO BIG. Weird, right?  I held up the old 6 to the new 6 (sole to sole), and the new one is about 1/3 - 1/2 an inch longer. ARG!<br /><br />I thought they might just need to be worn (? worth a shot since I can't return) and wore them to work, but my heel popped out of the shoe every time I stepped.<br /><br />Waste of $40, but hopefully you will know to GO SMALLER if you're used to year-old Tom's sizes....
B00B2M78B4|5.0|Mingus pushes Ellington into some unusual improvisations.  All compositions are by the Duke but have the drive and energy that Roach and Mingus brought to mid century modern jazz.
1591845831|5.0|Great book!  Must read for managers and motivators.  Effectuating change in others begins with the only person you can change - you!  This book tells you how to change so that others will be enchanted and respond in kind.  LOVED IT!

B00DKY4LBW|5.0|Arctic Monkeys have been hands down my favorite band since discovering them back in '07.  I became instantly obsessed after realizing the lyrical brilliance and the relevance of their lyrics to any 18-22 year olds woes.  Now that I am a bit older and wiser, so is AM.  Their lyrics and music are timeless, but still evoke that emotion you felt when you first heard their songs years ago, and AM is no different.  They've matured, I've matured, and they are simply the soundtrack of my life.  It is truly an amazing album in every way, shape, and form.  Five starts through and through.  10 stars.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Very satisfied. Great movie. Ive always loved Cher's music and now love Christina's music. Burlesque! What a bargain! This is a classic.

B003PBB4ME|5.0|Awesome addition to my camera accessory collection! Very, very useful with my video recording and it is secure to my camera. No worries
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest gives so many ideas on anything I can imagine plus so much more! I've even been able to use it as a design tool for 2 clients that can't see the vision I have for their home and garden, but I found something similar on Pinterest and that has sparked ideas for them! Plus I have not only on my computer, but have added it to my Kindle and smart phone for the portability to bring images to clients, and friends! I think that's fantastic!
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|It is fun to take the technical world off the DS screen and recreate it in a three d image with your own hands.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I loved this video presentation, especially the special features.  I wish the interviews with the band members were longer, or there was more footage on the rehearsals. I really would have liked to have learned who all of George's band mates that were on stage were, not just by their names but their association with George because I wasn't familiar with many of them. For example, who was the white haired smiling guitar player?  Or the guy w/the Irish cap? The Monty Python guys were hilarious.  The Indian music was interesting, especially discovering that those musicians don't read music, that they memorize it all.  I hated to see it end. And shipping from Amazon is always on time.  A must see for any George Harrison fan.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|It is simply perfect and haunting.  It stays with you after you finish and I was shocked that some schools have banned it.  Are you kidding me?  I didnt find it offensive at all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's just awesome :) it lets your imagination run free and in the game you can literally run free and create.
0380807343|5.0|I am over 60 and love Neil Gaiman's books.  This book is very easy to read and is good for all ages.  It takes many twists and turns and is a page turner.  I would recommend this book.

0465011047|5.0|This book is eye opening.  The conditions that the North Korean's live under are awful.  This is a story of a family that was duped into thinking living in North Korea would make their lives better.  What a joke.  They were certainly fooled.

039916409X|5.0|I've been eagerly waiting the release of this book. I did receive an advance copy of Tapping Into Wealth from Penguin and I'm mighty impressed. I want a hard bound copy for my resource library. Margaret Lynch's insights into money and wealth manifestation, our money programming (personal, family, and generational) was eye-opening. The actual tools for shattering my old money programming...and how to step powerfully, alive, vibrant, and worthy into earning my true value has already had an impact on my \\"bottom line.\\" This book is NOT some airy-fairy \\"let's attract prosperity\\" woo-woo book. It's a training manual about getting deep down to your toe-nails on how to get real with your relationship to money.<br /><br />Here's a breakdown of the 17 chapters in Tapping Into Wealth...as a nice perk, the author gives links at the end of each chapter to a companion video training series to supplement each of the written chapters.<br /><br />Chapter 1 The Mind/Body Money Connection<br />How your relationship to money is as tied to the Mind/Body connection as negative emotions and illness. Uncover the real reason the Law of Attraction isn't working for you by starting to understand the money blocks that undermine any positive intentions you are sending out.<br /><br />Chapter 2 The Basics of Tapping<br />The science behind it, people you know and respect who use it, how it can reach your subconscious, and how simple (and fun) it is to do yourself!<br /><br />Chapter 3 The Five Categories of Money<br />CASH! Let go of euphemisms for money like abundance and prosperity and get at the real shapes money takes on in your life. Uncover the five categories money falls into and start to understand the emotions and programming attached to each that's holding you back.<br /><br />Chapter 4 How Do You Really Feel about Money? (Not Abundance--Money!) It's time to face your feelings about money. This Chapter is full of exercises to begin clearing away the negative emotions you have about money so you can begin to LIBERATE yourself from your programming.<br /><br />Chapter 5 Your Earliest View of Money Paradigm<br />(This was eye-opening for sure) Go back to your childhood to observe what you saw and heard in your family's relationship with money that became \\"truths\\" you absorbed and still believe today. Unearth your wealth \\"vows\\" and limiting set points for your worth and begin the Tapping work to clear them.<br /><br />Chapter 6 Financial Trauma<br />Troubling financial events are more than just a bad experience - they can cause catastrophic financial trauma that forever controls your financial picture unless you are able to acknowledge and move past them! This crucial chapter is full of tailored, life-changing Tapping exercises that will allow you to move forward and trust yourself again in your money.<br /><br />Chapter 7 How Debt Keeps You Stuck<br />There's good debt, bad debt - and emotional debt. When you use Tapping to get at the roots of the emotions of bad debt, you clear away a huge subconscious barrier to manifesting money and begin moving from debt to true wealth.<br /><br />Chapter 8 Your Hidden Agendas<br />You've worked to clear your limiting programming about money, wealth vows and financial traumas. Using guided mapping, now identify and take apart the very structure of your hidden agenda to break free of the cycle of negativity and shift to the positive.<br /><br />Chapter 9 Resistance to Setting Big Goals<br />You have to set big goals to get big results. Tapping is a highly effective tool to break your resistance and switch the act of setting and attaining  big goal from stressful to motivating and full of promise.<br /><br />Chapter 10 Setting Outrageous Goals<br />Only outrageous goals give you outrageous results! The resistance that comes up when you challenge yourself to identify and share these goals is powerful - and when you stop resisting your creativity and inner entrepreneur steps in to lead you where you need to go.<br /><br />Chapter 11 Goal Trauma<br />Just like financial trauma, goal trauma can cast permanent dark clouds over future goals unless you call them out and send them away through Tapping. Don't let it rain on your aspirations any longer!<br /><br />Chapter 12 \\"I Don't Deserve More Money\\"<br />This is the Chapter where the biggest changes happen. Come face to face with your set points for how much you can earn and how much you are allowed to be worth - and for the first time, act to raise them.<br /><br />Chapter 13 Breaking the Cycle of Always Striving But Never Arriving<br />You know you work extremely hard toward your goals. But you must address your relationship with perfection to get off the treadmill and start getting somewhere.<br /><br />Chapter 14 Feeling Invisible<br />Do the people around you know your power or are \\"you\\" hidden to them? Through Tapping, shine the light on your own brilliance and watch things transform around you.<br /><br />Chapter 15 Becoming a Great Receiver<br />Learn how you've put up obstacles and been programmed to refuse support from others toward your goals, needs and desires. You shouldn't do everything alone. Tapping allows you to be open to the help you need and achieve even more!<br /><br />Chapter 16 I Refuse to Be Rich!<br />Just below the surface of how lots of money seems like a no-brainer lurks this limiting block that sabotages your goals. Learn how to get out from under the \\"money shadow\\" that depicts wealth as negative.<br /><br />Chapter 17 The Five Disciplines to Creating a New Vibration about Money<br />With five disciplines provided for you to follow on a daily basis, find a sustainable way to continue growing and benefiting from the life-changing work you've done thus far!<br /><br />I liked this book a lot. Lynch cuts through the woo-woo crap about wealth and prosperity. She invites us readers to take a deep, long conscious look at why we do the things we do around money.><br />Chapter 11 Goal Trauma<br />Just like financial trauma, goal trauma can cast permanent dark clouds over future goals unless you call them out and send them away through Tapping.

1476727651|4.0|-Themes-<br /><br />No, for those of you wondering, this particular Steven King novel is not very scary. Not in the way you'll be expecting, at least. Even though King said this was, \\"A return to balls-to-the-wall, keep-the-lights-on horror,\\" the book is better defined by the following line found in the Author's Note, \\"I like to think I'm still pretty good at what I do, but nothing can live up to the memory of a good scare, and I mean nothing, especially if administered to one who is young and impressionable.\\" With age, though, you also realize that reality can be a hell of a lot scarier than fantasy. Most of the people who read The Shining as young adults now have very special little ones of their own (whether they're kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews, godchildren, etc.), and I would venture to guess that they'll find some of the themes discussed in this sequel more frightening than any creature or idea that came out of the original. Inheriting your parents' worse demons or losing a child, especially to murder, is far more horrible then Mrs. Massey will ever be. Suddenly people like Josh Powell scare you more than John Torrance because at least dear old Johnny wasn't a real person and what he tried to do to his son was only part of a ghost story put to paper.<br /><br />-On Siblings-<br /><br />During the first few days following the book's release, I unintentionally read some online rumors and regrettably sort of knew to expect a brother-sister relationship plot twist somewhere, somehow. I just didn't know to what extent. I was pretty convinced though, until King brushed on the subject, that Snakebite Andi was Danny's sister, not Lucy. It's probably perception or maybe even a lot of assumption on my part, but I got much more of a real rage vibe from her then I did from Lucy (or Abra for that matter). I thought because she was introduced in tandem with Dan and in such detail compared to the rest of the True Knot the two of them were a shoo-in for that connection. She would have been 32 when Dan was 29, not too far of a stretch, and coming from the background that she did it wouldn't have been hard to believe that her mother was a \\"good-time gal\\" like Lucy's, the logistics and details are vague enough to allow for it even with the suggested incest. I really got a false sense of foreshadowing when I read the line, \\"Family trees sometimes grow strange branches.\\" To me, it would have made a satisfying full-circle and bring an equal but opposite, immovable object meets an unstoppable force sort of balance to the Torrance family scale. One gifted child eventually chooses light in spite of his terrifying experiences with evil at the Overlook Hotel; the other eventually embraces darkness, turning her gifts and also tortured beginnings toward a power that ultimately brings about her own demise atop the Roof O' the World (in my head that's how it would have gone down, anyway). With her rightful hatred of men and Dan's unconditional love for a monstrous father, the juxtaposition just worked for, and unfortunately misled, me. I think the genealogy King came up with still does the trick though. Not to mention, Concetta's personality and overall essence go along nicely with the more positive traits of the Torrance bloodline.<br /><br />-Young Dan and the AA References-<br /><br />I really enjoyed the early snippets of Wendy and Danny's life following the Overlook's incineration, as well as Danny learning to deal with his residual shining, but a lot of reviewers have written that they wanted to know more about his path into young adulthood and particularly into alcoholism. Personally, I didn't need to know more. I thought the treatment was perfect. Anything more would have been rehashing the same information and dragging out the story. King sums it up with this exchange between John Dalton and Dan:<br /><br />\\"When did you find out that you could read minds?\\"<br />\\"... I never did. I just always had it [the shining]. It came with the original equipment.\\"<br />\\"And you drank to block it out.\\"<br />\\"You know better than that, Johnny. Why does any alcoholic drink?\\"<br />\\"Because he's an alcoholic?\\"<br />\\"Bingo. Simple as can be. Cut through the psychobabble and you're left with the stark truth. We drank because we're drunks.\\"<br /><br />I don't understand why some people complained about the volume of AA references and mantras/traditions mentioned throughout the book. Addiction is a lifelong disease. It doesn't go away after a few meetings or a few feeble resolutions vowed to ones' own sick self. Why would it have been any less present than Dan's own ability to shine by the end of the book? It's a testament of his willpower.<br /><br />-My Only Real Criticism-<br /><br />\\"Not everyone makes love the same way.\\" One of my college film professors said this during a class discussion about Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. According to him, Kubrick shied away from sex scenes for this very reason. If it's not you, and if it doesn't look exactly like what you're accustomed to doing with your partner, then you're going to feel awkward while watching it, which further stands to reason that the rest of the audience is going to feel awkward right along with you. That sentiment describes my reaction to King's introduction of the True Knot. Sorry, but I got nothing out of Rose and Andi's one-night-stand. Truth be told, I really didn't get much out of how a rube is turned either. The cycling thing is interesting, but it didn't need to be explained right then and there. My honest to God opinion is that the True's introduction should have been the 10th passage in Chapter Two: Bad Numbers. No changes, exactly as it was written, because that's some power stuff right there. A group of vampires stake out the World Trade Center a few weeks before 9/11 in order to feed on the atmosphere of death and destruction cause by the terrorist attacks? That's far more powerful than the caricature of Alice Cooper-esque characters we meet in a movie theater during a showing of Raiders of the Lost Ark. I wanted to take them more seriously but initially just couldn't. No offense, Steven King, but these characters did a good enough job personifying the Baby Boomer stereotype throughout the rest of the book. They didn't need these first two plot points, however, I also understand that authors have to write for their time and place (for their audience really). But I kept hearing in my head George Carlin say, \\"Whiny, narcissistic, self-indulgent people with a simple philosophy: \\"Gimme that! It's mine! These people were given everything, everything was handed to them, and they took it all, sold it all; sex, drugs, and rock `n' roll, and they stayed loaded for twenty years and had a free ride.\\" Until I read that 10th passage. Then the comedy bit stopped, and I realized that these people were dangerous. And evil. Very evil. All by itself, with no lead up, that introduction would have made a very shocking first impression.<br /><br />-N0S4A2 & Pop Culture-<br /><br />Going back to the whole writing for your time and place thing, the pop culture references didn't really bother me in this book like they apparently did for others. The only one that did was that Fredrica Bimmel namedrop (I found it a little too random and distracting, I'm not sure why though). We live in a very over-the-top age, eclectic age with information at our fingertips (thank you, Internet). All these references are just a reflection of that fact. But, then again, the few references to Joe Hill's N0S4A2 didn't bother me either (probably because I really enjoyed/liked that book). I wish they would have been a little more creative, but I enjoyed them nonetheless. All I can say is that Bruce Wayne Carmody and Abra Rafaella Stone need to meet. And not like cross paths: really, actually meet. Because I would by that book in a hot shut-up-and-take-my-money second. Maybe Richard Bachman could write it.inal equipment.\\"<br />\\"And you drank to block it out.\\"<br />\\"You know better than that, Johnny.

And not like cross paths: really, actually meet. Because I would by that book in a hot shut-up-and-take-my-money second. Maybe Richard Bachman could write it.

Since then I have bought copies of this book and given them to people who I knew would understand and use the beliefs to change their lives.

1439170916|5.0|I'd heard from the people at the Damon Runyon Foundation that this book was really good, but I had put off reading it for awhile.  I am really glad this finally came to the top of my stack.  This is an excellent book for anyone interested in cancer and the history of how it has been viewed by man over the last 4000 years.<br /><br />The thing which most impresses me is the humanity of the book.  Many times, the author choose to make his point about a particular form of cancer by telling us about patients he has treated. Some of them have lived, some died.  In every case, their situation is rendered faithfully.<br /><br />I also like that although he does not talk down to his audience, he also doesn't shy away from some of the details of the important discoveries of the last 30 years.  It is during those years we made the big leaps in understanding the bio-mechanisms of cancers. 'Jammed accelerators and missing brakes' is a good metaphor for the two ways cancers grows and develops.<br /><br />At the end of the book, you'll be heartened by what we've learned, humbled at how much we don't know, and then thoroughly immersed in two key facts which are essential to understanding cancer.  First of all, all cancers are genetic, and almost every cancer is subtly different from every other cancer because there are so many mutations in each instance of cancer.  Secondly, following directly from the first, since cancer is a mutable disease, it is not a stationary target.  Cancers evolve inside patients, which is why drugs that work seeming miracles stop working when the cancer mutates. That's what's behind remissions which stop remissing and spring forth again.<br /><br />I do have a minor quarrel with the book and its editor.  Twice in the book, the author asserts something which is wildly inaccurate geographically.  First he asserts that there is a cancer clinic which lies in New York, two hundred miles south of Yale.  Two hundred miles south of New Haven places one in the Atlantic Ocean.  New York is west of Connecticut, with a small portion being south west.  A few hundred pages on, he tells us that Prague is two hundred miles south of Berlin.  Actually, it's east.  Poland is Germany's eastern neighbor.<br /><br />Just one more sign of the fall of quality editorial practice in publishing today, it would seem.<br /><br />That said, this is a great book to learn about cancer.  Just skip the parts about geography and you'll be fine.<br /><br />Highly recommended!lantic Ocean.  New York is west of Connecticut, with a small portion being south west.

The author's story reminded me of Downton Abbey so if you liked the tv series, you will probably like this book. Characters are numerous and some are not developed, but the conditions of servants and women's places in this society as well as the storyline generated much discussion at our book club.

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I studied French in high school and college years ago, and I've picked up a bit of Spanish here and there, and by reading some of the Bible in Spanish. I decided to pick up some German with Duolingo because I have a nephew who studied that. Well, that started out so well I decided to brush up my French and see what I could do with Spanish. Probably not a good idea to work on three languages at once, but I'm enjoying it and making progress. I was so rusty on French my attempt to test out of the Basics failed (just barely), but it's nice to know the option is there if you don't want to review from the beginning. Repetition is an important part of learning any language, but it can get boring. This program solves the problem by mixing up the styles of questions. It starts out very easy - some of the questions are as easy as tapping the picture of the word given in your native language with the target language below it. On some questions, you can tap the given word and see its translation, so you don't have to guess even if it is a new word (but guessing can be fun and doesn't \\"hurt\\" much!). Pay attention to the little words that go with them, though! In English (which is hard to learn in other ways) we just have \\"the\\" for everything, but in French and Spanish you have variations to match the gender and number of the objects (German has three singular forms, one being neuter, I guess). How do you know if an object takes a masculine (le or el) or feminine (la)? Practice, practice, practice! Take your time and think and memorize, and write words and combinations down. And Duolingo does let you go back and review skill sets. The instant feedback is much more enjoyable than doing written homework, but the German is making me want to get a textbook and do some extra studying! Some questions let you translate phrases or sentences by selecting from a choice of words, others let you listen to spoken words, phrases, or sentences and then select the words you hear. More challenging questions require you to type in the translation or words from memory. It even has voice recognition so some questions require you to repeat things in the target language. If it doesn't recognize what you say, it doesn't count it against you (lots of things can go wrong with voice recognition, such as background noises). If you can't get away from the noise or otherwise can't or don't want to use your microphone, you can turn off that feature and it will only give you the other kinds of questions. I've noticed that it also gives some leeway for typographical errors, although sometimes it's still counted typos as wrong and other times I've just been wrong but it was counted as a typo. It generally gets it right and the two kinds of errors balance out. I've typed in a translation when the task was to type out what was spoken in the foreign language, and it gave me a do-over. But watch out, if you make a mistake in your own language, it will count that wrong, too! English speakers had better know how to properly use \\"to,\\" \\"too,\\" and \\"two,\\" for example. Or maybe using DuoLingo will help you with that, too! Daily e-mail reminders (which can be turned off) help you to stick to it.<br /><br />[ADDED LATER] Well, I'm up to Level 5 in all three languages, and I'm definitely feeling the pinch of trying to make it QuadLingo. As I fail lessons, though, previous skills re-open to show where I need to go back and practice more, which is a good thing. It's exciting to be learning these languages, and I'm thinking I might dig through my collection of language texts to add to and aid my DuoLingo studies, since I've gone and set myself a three-pronged challenge. I wish I'd thought of taking notes earlier (I just added that bit with this edit); I'm sure that would be enough to make studying one language a cinch with DuoLingo.

Only wish they had cut down the swearing as it didn't add much but makes it much less desirable for parents who have younger teens viewing. This is a PG13+ movie for sex, drugs, language. Highly entertaining to teens and mostly set in High School.

B004I8WD6E|4.0|I have been using this Amazon clear case for over two years now and it's still holding up.  I must have dropped my phone twenty some times during the past two years and not a single dent or scratch on my iPhone 4S.  I give Amazon kudos for making this durable/good looking case for a very low price.<br /><br />There is only one problem, the color of the case changed from clear to blueish brown in only a few months.  I wear blue jeans, so that's how the case got discolored.  But since the case is so cheap, you can easily buy a new one for spare.<br /><br />I rarely write product review on Amazon, but I really like this product and want potential buyers to know how great it is.  I would give this case 4.5 starts out of 5 if it was possible.

B00ARPMIJE|5.0|I initially picked up A French Girl in New York while searching for books for my daughter. This book was free (our book budget had already been spent that week) and it sounded interesting. Even though I had several other books to read (plus working on my second book) I decided to start reading this one. Anna Adams created characters with great detail and care. Each character had depth to them; this book although modern reminded me of the classics that I so adore! The detail and description found in these pages carried me away to New York and France. I had to push past the first chapter and a half but once I did I was whisked away into Maude's world.<br /><br /> Maude Laurent has never known her parents. She was raised (if you can call it that) by the Ruchets. She was treated worse than a servant. She was treated as a slave. She was forced to sleep on a thin mattress in a basement with no light and rats. She found her escape in music at the local library, where she taught herself how to play the piano. During a class trip to Paris she is discovered by James Baldwin who was there on business. Maude goes to New York to live with the Baldwin family for 6 months while she records her album. She knows that she will have to return to France but she wants to make the most of her time in New York, a time where she feels free. She quickly befriends the Baldwin sisters Jazmine and Cynthia along with their younger brother Ben. Victoria Baldwin is a mother like none that Maude has ever seen. they show her what a family is.<br /><br /> Matt is a famous pop singer. He is asked to work with Maude on her album, to help her to create her music. Matt is also from France but has lived in New York for 6 years.  The two of them do not hit it off right away; their first meeting is certainly one to remember. Matt enjoys pushing Maude's buttons. The day that he shows her around New York City is the day that he starts to lose himself to her. Will he ever be able to tell her how he feels?<br/><br /> Will Maude get to keep singing? Will she be a success or will she return to Carvin France and the Ruchets?<br /><br /> This book is brilliantly written! I look forward to reading the rest of Maude's story.

B001GA1RFA|1.0|I love to read. And I have this issue with not finishing books. In my life, I think there have been 5 books that I've started and never finished. I think this might end up being number 6.<br /><br />The main character, Colin, has a type - as many people do. However, his \\"type\\" is literary - that is to say, his \\"type\\" is girls named Katherine. By the start of the story, he has been dumped by 19 Katherines. He says in a couple of places that they dumped him because they just didn't like him. I can understand; I don't like him either. He's whiny, insecure, and self-absorbed. He's obsessed with \\"mattering\\" to the point that he ignores people and doesn't actually live his life. He seems to desperately want to matter, but has NO confidence with which to make an impression on anyone - constantly asking his girlfriend (or ex, as the case may be) if she still loves him, and insisting that she doesn't understand him, for instance. Annoying.<br /><br />Which is a stark contrast to the other characters in the book. Such as Hassan, who has no ambition and seems content to live with his parents forever, never go to college, and let his rich dad pay for his life. And Lindsey, for another example, who refuses to leave Gutshot, TN and do something with her life for fear of something bad happening.  While both of these people at least cultivate relationships while they're content to do nothing.<br /><br />So Colin gets dumped by Katherine the 19th, and his friend Hassan takes him on a road trip. They end up in Gutshot, TN, which is apparently the middle of nowhere where nothing ever happens - a great setting choice for a novel - and they decide to stay there (Again, a wonderful plot decision).  At 18 or 19 or whatever age Colin is, he's all freaked out that he's past his prime (since he was a child prodigy) and has missed his chance to matter. So he's working on this one last-ditch-attempt at mattering, which is to figure out a way to graphically/mathematically predict the course ofa relationship. While the math was kept relatively light, I did find myself skipping over a couple of paragraphs. Because... well... it's been a long time since my last math class and to be honest, I didn't follow it. To Green's credit, he saves detailed analysis of the math for an appendix entry rather than bogging down the novel with it further. But in a book that I'm already struggling to read, and already disliking every character that's introduced, the addition of math and repetitive anagramming really just isn't helping - and I'm not a math or anagram hater; I loved my math classes in school, it's just been a while, and I love word puzzles.<br /><br />I'm clearly in the minority with my opinion on this book, given the other reviews, but I'm really bummed out about this book. All of it together (boring setting, slow plot, annoying characters, math, anagrams, more annoying characters)... I just can't get into it.. The thing that gets me is that I've read several of John Green's books. He knows how to hold his reader's attention, create intrigue and even write annoying yet likable characters. He knows how to write entertaining road-trips (like in Paper Towns). He knows how to create a beginning that sucks you into the story, and how to write a plot that moves and entertains. But I'm not seeing that here. I'm grateful this wasn't my first Green or I might not have read more.<br /><br /> I'm sure that the story gets to a point where there's a moral and maybe the main character learns to be content and connect with others and whatnot. And maybe even some other cool stuff. But I just can't find anything redeemable enough to hold on to to propel me through the rest of it, and I don't like the characters enough to spend hours with them in order to see them grow.<br /><br />Personally, I'd skip this one and pick up another John Green instead.

B000AM2L1O|5.0|This is the 5th Mon Premier Calin I have purchased.  The first just went to college with my 17-year-old granddaughter (and yes, she is normal - an honor society student) who has had, and loved, this doll since she was 2.  My 3 year-old-granddaughter takes hers every place and won't sleep without her.  I have also purchased the Asian baby for a Vietnamese friend's daughter and the African-American version for another friend --- all the kids love this baby.  It is not only soft and cuddly, but smells like a newborn (baby powder).<br /><br />I cannot recommend this doll highly enough --- everyone who has one loves it.
B00E95ED32|5.0|I mainly wanted this for &#34;Wake Me Up&#34; for it had the house beat but something else that wasn't totally Country.  It was a moving piece of work.  The other tracks were a combination that was great to listen to.  This is an album for young and older.  It also shows the extent of Avicii's music production ability.

B00BQHA06A|5.0|I have been on board since Razorblade Romance and eagerly grab up each new release. After ScreamWorks-Love in Theory and Practice, I was a little skeptical as to whether this recording would ever happen. That record was flawless in every way and seemed like the end of a brilliant career. I guess the story would continue.  Indeed, it happened in the biggest and darkest way. It took about a month of repeated listening before it revealed itself and then I finally have grown to love this dark chest of wonders.<br /><br />First of all, this seems to be focused towards the dedicated fans. Its a bit encrypted for beginners. Its heavy, dark and painful. The main theme is once again the hopelessness of love. Hey, wait a minute, hasn't this been the main thread on every recording? I guess there are no surprises presented. Even if you have never listened to this band before, you can expect to hear about the pain of love. Its rather universal.<br /><br />Each track blossoms like a dark flower. Its beautiful and poisonous as Mr. Valo lets us experience these feelings with the pathos that only he can describe. The music is consistent with its driving \\"Love Metal\\" that seems to only get better on each album. Its like a fine wine that at first seems bitter, then gets mellow and sweet. There are several live concert sing a longs-Tears on Tape and W.L.S.T.D. are those type of swaying back and forth stadium anthems that draw the audience right in. If you ever get a chance, see this band live. They are perfect onstage.<br /><br />Then comes Hearts at War which is my favorite track. It seems like the spearhead of everything they have ever recorded. No Love, Drawn and Quartered put the frosting on this icy cake that's hard to swallow, yet oh so satisfying once it goes down. This time it ends on a note of hopelessness and promises more. That's it. The tape gets ejected....

B00CF34B2I|1.0|At present, I cannot recommend getting this game, even as a free download, no matter how appealing it seems to be.<br /><br />This particular app allows free play on some of the features of the entire game. Among other in-game purchase opportunities is the unlocking of multiple playable decks against multiple opponent decks. Or it would if the damn thing worked at all. Incompatibility on Kindle devices is a known and common problem that hasn't been addressed over many months, but I have an Acer tablet, and this game doesn't play well on that platform either. How many other tablets will this game not work on? Will you spend several dollars to find out? I don't recommend trying to find out.<br /><br />Customer support has been less than helpful. They suggest shutting down \\"unnecessary\\" applications running on my device in order to make their app work. So now I spend ten times as much time shutting down apps and clicking through the stupid \\"click to pass go\\" splash screens and ads as I do playing the game, that is, when the above process works at all.<br /><br />Even purchasing the game doesn't allow all content. There are MORE opportunities to buy MORE products in-game, none of which allowed the actual playing of said game. Just recently appeared ANOTHER splash screen that has to be clicked through, suggesting that I buy the game's expansion. I'm not gonna do it.<br /><br />I've asked to get a refund on what I've paid for so far. I'm through with this game. If you want to get the free, stunted version of the game, go ahead. See if it will work for you. When I DID get to play it, I enjoyed it very much, but the frustration that built up trying to get it to work more than made up for any pleasure derived from playing it.
B008JFUO72|5.0|I liked the movie because of the premise as well as the acting.  It was great the way the flight suit came together on RDJ and the scale of the moviepushed the envelope.  Favreau is a very talented director!!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I am hopeful that the technology will come along to be able to Chromecast Hulu and Amazon from my PC to the TV.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|This movie was fascinating from beginning to end.  It is an extraordinary story with a surprising ending.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
B00EDK283A|5.0|This is the first album I've heard from Arven. I'm impressed. I think this band is going places in the future.  Good vocals, good music that doesn't drown out the vocals. Good melodies. I look forward to more.<br /><br />I especially liked the renaissance/medieval/folk vibe in the songs. It makes them stand out from &#34;standard&#34; metal albums
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|The story is really great and the actors are all superb in this movie.  The special effects are great and it really sparked the imagination!!!
B009L32R5I|3.0|This brings back memories of those halcyon days of Genesis. The songs are well delivered and the mix of vocalists definitely adds to the songs.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the new arrangements were so similar to the originals. The originals were great and if I want to listen to them I can get the original versions. I had hoped that there would be more creativity in the new arrangements as was the case on the first &#34;Genesis Revisited&#34; album.<br /><br />Anyway, great songs, great musicians, great vocalists. Well worth the price.
B0058S0OMS|5.0|i can't NOT recomemed this version of halloween II enough but a few questions does it have the tv edit of halloween II & the full version of terror in the aisles also?
B004G606K8|5.0|Read this series so many years ago and now I have added to my kindle. It is a great joy to travel with the companions again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app to pass time. Or great for the little one who want a pony. This  Will teach them home much work that pony or horse is. Teaches to feed and groom daily and goals can't be achieved without proper are.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Easily one of my all time favorite albums.<br />I can still play it again and again and it never gets old.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|the case is perfect fits like a glove, now I need the screen protector and maybe a key board too.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The maze runner is the best book in the world. I wold not want to read a different book. By kaleb
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is a pretty cool device. Just the switch of an input and you can show any YouTube video, Netflix, or tab from your Chrome browser on your computer. On mobile, you can stream YouTube and Netflix TO your tv very easily. Response is a little delayed along with a few seconds of loading time, but what do you expect from a small, sleek, first of its kind product for a really good price?? Doesn't get much better than that if you ask me. Also, it is 720p, not 1080. Very cool gadget
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a captivating book that was hard to put down.<br /> It did drag at times but was a great read.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|I was extremely pleased that of so many discs, there were no defects. It lived up to my expectations. The only thing I wish it had was some hard copy booklets for me to enjoy snacking on. In this type of packaging and price level, that was not expected of course.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love letting time slip away to this game.  Just enough of a brain game that I can play it before bed.
B009NNMB70|5.0|I have been in love with 1D since the Xfactor but for some reason in 2013 I became an even bigger fan. I've seen all of their previous movies and they were good, but NOTHING compared to This Is Us. I went to see it on August 30 the first time (that's the day it came out in theatres) and I loved it! My mom wasn't sure about this movie but she loved it too. I've seen it 8 or 9 times in theatres. My mom, grandma, and stepdad have all seen it three times and they all LOVED it. I learned many things about them and I realized how hard they have to work for us directioners every day. When the concert parts were on I thought it was better than an actual concert. I could really hear the boys! This Is Us has AMAZAYN quality. This is by far my favorite movie! So to everyone (INCLUDING PARENTS), I Totally recommend you go see it. You will not be disappointed.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If you are into technology, and like to keep up with the newest digital trends, then you will certainly enjoy this product. It has some bad days as the service is still in testing (beta). For 35 bucks, you can't go wrong.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|TV has been great but wish they make more of the serious and have a great job for doing things.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|A great mystery with a funny side and lots of twists and turns.  I'd like to read more of this author's books.
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|That collect is the best thing and how come we don't have more of these horror and provide good it.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Awesome!  I don't understand why I have to write twenty words when all I want to write is awesome! Awesome!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played. It is by far better than temple run with more  challenges and it changes the location and theme every month which makes it awesomer if you love temple run you will positively be addicted to after the first try and makes you more competitive to want to beat your friends high scores and brag to them I suggest you buy this game it is a must you NEED to buy this game or else you haven't lived.
B009SH5JS4|5.0|This movie is funny, sweet and oh so cute! It has some real belly laugh moments and I think Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline share great onscreen chemistry. If you're a hopeless romantic (like me), you will love this movie, but if sweet saccharine type movies make you ill, you may not find it as entertaining as I did. My package arrived ahead of the estimated date and time, in brand-new shrink-wrap packaging. Wonderful ordering experience with this merchant!
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|Everyone loves a magic trick and everyone will love this movie. It is original and very well done on all fronts. It was cast well. It was acted well. The story is great.The idea is superior. the camera work is wonderful. The friendships and loyalty depicted are warm and believable. Truly an outstanding effort. I watched it and immediately ordered my own copy.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|Although I enjoy Scalzi's  flip moments as they are in his other novels, here we have &#34;all flip, all the time&#34; and it grew wearisome.  I know its won all the usual awards, I think it was the premise that opened people's eyes - and not the writing.
B005LAIGLE|5.0|This movie is a wonderfully told actually original story that has all the earmarks for a great movie night. Full of great twists and turns with the ring of reality and the glow of suspense, but done with humor and the feel of friendship. Well developed characters and storyline with great trade craft in all aspects. I had seen this movie and ordered it because I want to watch it again and again. I hate the cop shows that inundate the airways and movie theatres and this helps to balance out that sour taste. I recommend this for anyone who loves movies.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|I'd say this is a solid 3.5 stars. When I first started it, I was thinking it'd be a three-star flick, but it's pretty good overall, the action is good throughout the movie, there are no dull spots, and the mountain fight scene is amazing. That scene alone might bump it up to 4 stars - it's done better than most of the James Bond stuff, and is a pretty novel idea. A solid, entertaining action flick.
B00003CXWV|5.0|The story is set during a time when I was coming of age and it is depicted very very close to reality. The story is sad overall but some of the scenes are so full of life and youth that you can taste it. And after all Johnny is hot hot hot. His make up in the end is pretty bad, but it is a great film. This is to replace my old copy.
B005KISG3K|1.0|This toy is not fun on it's own. This is not a whole set even tho the pictures make it look like it is. If you're looking to have fun, buy the set straight from Amazon for $10.00. (shipping is free on products over $25.)Then open the set and have more collectible figures. You pay less for each figure and get more for your money.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was a DNF for me.. i actually tried to read this months ago, just couldn't get past the poorly written content and the unrealistic way the lifestyle is portrayed. Not to mention the usual issues that people in the lifestyle or those seriously curious about it, mention. Which i won't re-hash here.<br /><br />i did want to give it another try though, but i just couldn't get past the above issues with this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best but give us more chances to get jackpot<br /><br />It is good I love it but we need more characters
B00D6DVSAE|2.0|I did not like this latest cd by Sting.  It may or may not be a good cd, but I can definitely say it wasn't what I expected.  I assumed it would be soft-rock, but I was wrong.  I recommend potential buyers listen to a sample of the songs on the internet before they decide to purchase it.
B00D48BSBA|5.0|This novel is a fast paced one and completely enjoyed reading this. He is a master story teller of all times
B006FE83UE|5.0|I like this movie.  My next movie to order is The Yearling with Gregory Peck.  He also had a short part in the remake of Cape Fear, which he also starred in.  All his movies are good.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|First off the game is great, keep it up backflip! But, where is the new update? I was really looking forward to it. Hopefully it comes out soon.
B000002U9L|5.0|Jim Henson created a lot of great movies, especially Labyrinth.  I really enjoy the soundtrack because David Bowie is also a great performer.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I love this app. I use it to write all of my fan fiction in. I like how you can set a password on your notebooks. I use that so my brother doesn't go and erase all my hard work. I also like how you can change the notebook covers, titles, and number of pages in the notebook. I reccomend that you get this app. It can be used for anything.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This works great because it shows the memory and you could put negative numbers this is a great app buy it you might agree with me
B005XN3150|5.0|Welcome to a magical world...a world of fairy tales. Love how they take all the characters and slowly introduce them to us.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love it but there needs more updates<br />I have a daughter who plays and she keeps asking for me to look on YouTube for the next update
B009K0OPQQ|5.0|Season 2 of Once Upon a Time was even better than season 1. I can't wait to see where #3 will take us. Awesome magical show.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|A great read from start to finish.<br />Very compelling - I couldn't put it down.  I liked the way he entwined all outcomes of the intricacies of time travel.
B008L5G4I8|4.0|As I expected, very good.  Not 'meaty' enough for 5 stars, but sets a pleasing atmosphere, if you like the genre, which I do.
B00FN811SY|5.0|A great Bible translation purchased from Amazon.com.It is easy to understand and accurate for our day and language. I Would recommend it for any Bible student.
0316056898|5.0|This was the funniest book I read in a long time. I laughed out loud throughout the whole book. Anyone who loves Tina Fey, and her characters, will love this book. I couldn't help but hear Liz Lemon as I was reading some parts of the book. Loved getting a small behind the scenes glimpse of SNL and 30 Rock. It's a great re-read too; the jokes are just as funny the second time around.
B000VALY54|5.0|If you like Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr, then this is a must for your DVD collection . Classic 90's type movie for both of them.
B00A376YAK|5.0|This book gets to the heart of what makes Ruby such an amazing language.  It is also a great example of why reading an in-depth discussion on a topic in (e)book form can be far more valuable than spending the same amount of time researching the topic online.<br /><br />The author starts by letting you know the ever-important \\"whys\\" around the language's origin & design; many of which I didn't know despite programming in Ruby for many years.  Building on these basics, the author presents a coherent view of how to use the unique features of the language to become much more effective at software development.  He extends this with example after example of how the world's best have done exactly that in Ruby's popular frameworks & gems -- including the core components of Ruby on Rails and ActiveRecord.<br /><br />A few reviews I saw before reading the book mentioned the story-based narrative was distracting.  While I can completely see this point of view, and the author is a developer not a novelist for sure, the story did serve as a solid tool to connect the various topics.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended.
B000000W5N|4.0|Rolling Stones music is always a good purchase. Bought this for my husband. We have gone through LPs, Cassettes, and now a CD with this album.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|I only watched out of curiosity and I am SO HAPPY THAT I DID!!!  This movie is way better than Stallone's version by far. Its dark and it totally draws you  in.  I like Karl Urban as an actor and I have seen much of his work and I think he did a fabulous job on this movies. This is the kind of movie that can give you dreams and it draws you back each time it's on Cable because it is just that good![[ASIN:B009YQJ322 Dredd [DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet]]]
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|One of my favorite bands just keeps putting out one Grammy winner after another. This is a must buy for any TTB fans!!!!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I am enjoying hearing the characters speak. Also, the puzzles are trickier to figure out from the first game. Entertaining!
0345494997|5.0|I love this historical fiction novel.  Remarkable! The book I purchased was signed by the author--which makes it even better.
B000I9X53W|5.0|What a fun film and a great exercise in social studies. I watched it with my daughter - but it may not be for all kids as it takes a little explaining. But Hoffman is the best — what range. I love his work!
0385743564|5.0|There were moments during the novel when I thought about dropping the star rating down a bit from five stars. Little bothersome things here and there, that might have warranted a chipping off of a quarter star or so.<br /><br />Still, 4.5 or 4.75 is pretty great.<br /><br />And then the ending. And none of that matters. It's a five-star book. Because Sanderson brings everything home in this story.<br /><br />It all starts off with 8 yr old David witnessing his father being killed by Steelheart--but not until he sees Steelheart bleed. So Stealheart does have a weakness, as all Epics do, and David becomes obsessed with finding Stealheart's and taking him down.<br /><br />Ten years later, David finally meets up with the Reckoners and \\"interferes\\" with one of their hits on an Epic, landing him a spot in their group, and pushing them to make his goal their goal.<br /><br />The book is, as cliche as it sounds, pretty much non-stop action. The story reads like an action movie, which is something I enjoyed. While I am an avid reader of all kinds of speculative genres, I tend to prefer my sci-fi and superheroes in movie form. Well, this was like having the best of both worlds.<br /><br />There is solid characterization, great description, and a well-developed story world. And something I particularly appreciated: the plant and payoff. Lots of little details woven in that influence things later on, or turn out to be aha moments. (So, yes, I did see *one* rather big thing coming, but it was satisfying to know I was right rather than frustrating that I'd figured it out.) There are touching moments in the story, too, but Sanderson does a good balancing act. There is emotion, but he never lets it get sappy.<br /><br />Anyway, I highly recommend the book for anyone who loves action and superheroes, and anyone who has been wondering \\"Where are all the male protagonists in YA?\\"
B005EGXTHG|3.0|I liked this book a lot. I'd recremed it for 13 to 40. It was a bit sad but I am only 11 so what do I know
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Game can be a good way to fill time.  Growth type game.  So far haven't run out of things to do
B000059TEQ|5.0|i chose this movie because I saw just a very little of this when I was a kid and I remember it being such a hugely famous...lots of hype publicity. It was EVERYWHERE!!<br />I loved it!  Inspite of the terrible sad theme..., it's still a beautiful little trek back to a truly simpler and more innocent time!!!<br /><br />I would reccomment it to anyone!
B008Y212PI|4.0|Requires thinking about possibilities.  Wish it had an &quot;undo&quot; button.  Some can't be solved without the hints.  5 square are easy, 10 are much harder at first.
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|I love this movie! I was so excited to see it available on blu-ray. Great extras and I'm very glad I waited.
B0061US58C|1.0|We use netflix daily with no problems but we couldn't get this movie to play properly. It would play for a few minutes then would be stuck loading. We finally gave up.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This actually works GREAT - the videos are clear and good sound and I like that you can also convert them to MP3 if you only want the song!!
B008RA3X5E|1.0|This clock only got one star because there wasn't an option for Zero.........cannot set this clock to my time zone (East coast)  Was a total wast of money..........
B00CC6Z19A|5.0|I haven't bought this yet.  I have been waiting for Oliver to get the blu-ray treatment for Ages.  I go online today and see that it is being sold by a 3rd party seller, and only 1 is left...and it's used!<br /><br />Also, the Editorial Review - it's in Italian (??????????)<br /><br />What is going on, Amazon???<br /><br />This is one of the best  musical put on film - and one of the very  few to win Best Picture.  It - and we - deserve better.<br /><br />Start stocking your own blu-rays on this, please!!! And new ones... :)
0316228532|2.0|There's no doubt Rowling knows how to write. Even with a distinct change of genre it's still clear that the author hasn't changed. What has changed is that rather than having great characters and stories like her previous work, this novel is all about petty drama and miserable pathetic people. I was bored from the first chapter, but kept going in hopes that it would get better. I eventually gave up because it was so frustratingly uninteresting. Rowling is better than this. I hope she realizes that and makes a better return in the future.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I was so surprised that with this app I could upload my Kindle to my phone. So now I have the Kindle at home and the phone on the go. It's great.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|I enjoyed playing this game the first time and reset it to play it a second time.  Colour me surprised when my Kindle overheated and with a sudden pop shut down.  I had to reboot my Kindle to get it turned back on again.  I waited a bit and then returned to the game only to have the same problem repeat itself after just a few minutes.  The opposite side from the charging port gets hot and suddenly your Kindle will pop and quit working.  I've played other games for an hour or more and never had my Kindle overheat.  I say there's a problem with the way the game loads onto the Kindle that causes the problem.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This may be my favorite game.  My son has loved it since he was six, and it really helps to develop thinking and strategy skills. (Our six year old taught us a move we had missed).<br /><br />The game takes a while to play, but lasts not nearly as long as chess.<br /><br />We also have the smaller, two person game which we play when my husband is working, but this classic size game is great for the whole family.  All of us give it five stars.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Much better than the first try at this. Very enjoyable sci-fi and well acted. I would most definitely watch this again.
1401937268|4.0|I would give this beautiful deck five stars except the details in the cards are hard to see. A friend mentioned that these cards are like &#34;Tarot on Steroids&#34; and I agree. So accurate and fun to read.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|The product listings are in a different format than those accessed on my Computer and I' unsure about the security of transactions.  While this APP does work, I prefer to use my computer.
B00FEN000S|5.0|For those who can appreciate the roots that this movie was based on: it is not only a superb and imaginative film, but an amazing movie EXPERIENCE as well (something that is not common in many movies these days.)<br />5 stars all the way!
B004OZOTSQ|4.0|For occasional use when you need to know what WIFi are  broadcasting and available.  I have had no need for it so far.  I've just tested it to see how it compares with my other computers WiFi devices.  .
B0017VG69U|5.0|absolutely amazed how well the remastered work is. well done. every episode has been brought back to todays standards. i remember the original release dates back in the day. the contrast is impecable. i cannot wait for my season one and three sets. no dvd set is complete without these. you dont know what your missing.
B00BEIYP8A|5.0|I don't like writing or reading movie reviews. They have almost zero impact on my decision to see or not see a movie. I usually get recommendations from friends or decide after seeing a promo or by the actors/director etc. Why am I saying this? because this is not a movie review. It's just my opinion as your virtual friend to go see this movie even if you are not a racing fan (which most of us aren't really). Good actors, good story, good action - good movie! one of the best I've seen lately and definitely Oscar material. This is why I go to the movies!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I've enjoyed all of sandersons work and this book is no exception. He has a gift for creating interesting and complex worlds, and a special interest in cresting magic systems.  Fast paced book with lots of great action.
159463176X|3.0|This book is about human relationships, that of blood and association, it's pursuance and power that drives the destiny of the main characters through time and geographical boundaries of three continents.<br />Khaled Hosseini is one of my favorite authors of the modern times. He is the salt of the earth kind of writer, a talented wordsmith who weaves simple emotions using simple words. In very few words, he builds a vivid life-like picture of his characters and situations, that bring out prompt emotions from the readers. You find the same simplicity throughout the book that effortlessly brings out the struggles of a war-torn nation, its people, and the socio-political upheavals that change the residents along with its landmarks through the sand storm called time.<br /><br />Hosseini weaves an intricate fabric of sub-plots that drives the story, sometime to unnecessary lengths. Agreed, that the intention was to show the battle of a family with destiny and adverse times, but even then I'd rather have shorter narratives on supporting characters and learn more, read more, live more - the lives of Abdullah, Pari, and Nila, rather than spending so much time in understanding the sub-plots to such minor detail.<br /><br />To put it simply, while it made me cry a lot of times, it also left me with a sense of disappointment. The characteristic elements of his writing were there intact, but the magic that was 'A Thousand Splendid Suns' or the poignant expression of 'The Kite Runner', were amiss in this novel.<br /><br />If I have to rate his three books in an order, I'll always rate 'A Thousand Splendid Suns' way above 'The Kite Runner' closely followed by 'And the Mountains Echoed'.
B006X08FDA|3.0|There are some really great tracks on this CD and a few that just don't do anything for me.  I had two very different reactions -- wonderful, and disappointing.  I bought the album mainly for the song &#34;Leaving Eden&#34;.  It is a beautiful and touching song and performed so well by Rhiannon Giddens on vocals when I saw them live.  The YouTube video of CCD perfoming &#34;Leaving Eden&#34; at the Grand Ole Opry is also brilliant, and well worth taking the trouble to listen.  However, I thought that the track of this song on the CD lacked power and did not move me nearly as much as their Grand Ole Opry performance.  Still these guys are great musicians and so fun to watch performing.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|OK...Daria began as a character on \\"Beavis & Butthead.\\"  And she was, no questions asked, the only character thereon who could match wits with them.  MTV's releasing all the episodes, plus both TV movies.  They...\\"regret\\" they \\"can't include the music.\\" As if \\"ninties music,\\" definitely an oxymoron, will be missed?  Looking forward to kicking back with like-minded friends and enjoying pure, unadulterated Daria without \\"the hip/cool factor\\" intruding.
B005544V6A|4.0|Crazy premise, but a fun, interesting and smart series. Well-written, complex characters got me hooked. Some really funny lines, villains to loathe and beautiful clothes and scenes. Fun and smart. Enjoyable entertainment.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Setup was a bit difficult, and now that it's installed, I can't always get it to work properly. When it does, I can get the same results from either my Tivo or my blu ray player.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|Extraordinary that a small cast and crew on a tiny budget can create a film that looks so beautiful-- the visual of the conversation on the ocean cliff under the moon in the blue evening sky is a cinematographically, as well as emotionally, breathtaking--and surpasses 95% of what the major studios put out. Funny, tender, tense, real. Refreshing and thrilling as a session in strong, cold waves.
1455121924|5.0|thank you for taking the time to inform the world the truth to this wheat time. I did not quite understand why wheat a natural product would be harmful - now i know
B003O86FMW|4.0|A worthy second book, generally the \\"ugly step-sibling\\" of any trilogy.  Unexpected twists keep up interest while awaiting the real meat and explanations of the final text.  I found myself caring slightly more for a somewhat unlikable leading role.  At times the amount of the basic plot lines that we are to believe Katniss is unaware, cause some plodding.  Overall the book is enjoyable and leaves me wanting to read the third installment.
B002L6I9Z4|4.0|Camera is perfect for the Lego fan. Very basic camera with low res screen and pics. Great for the kids!
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|It was a greaT Movie, sometimes it was sad , it had a surprise ending! It wasa about a handicapped person!

B005721W9O|4.0|pretty funny and cheesy and just about right. a good 'i'm bored' sort of movie to watch when nothing else is on.

She was renowned as the best word shaker of her region because she knew how powerless a person could be WITHOUT words.\\" This is one of my favorite quotes from an immensely quotable novel, that while the story line  concentrates on the horrors of war and Nazi Germany, it reveals to us the power of words. The importance of words. The love affair that a person can have with words. Through the course of this novel, we are reminded that words have the power to hurt. They have the power to save. They can take away fear. They can create lasting friendships. Words can make you a criminal. They can make you a savior. They can make you laugh, think, cry and escape. I already knew this because I have escaped into books as long as I can remember.<br /><br />Narrated by Death, this novel focuses on and tells the story of Liesel Meminger, her family, friends, her enemies and their struggles, triumphs and deep secrets they kept during the war.  She is a  teenage girl who holds herself as well as those around her,  together during one of the ugliest times in human history with the narratives drawn from books she manages to steal.<br /><br />Death is an interesting choice of narrator. Hasn't it been said, that war and death are best friends? Not in this novel. Death is tired, He is overworked, cleaning out the concentration camps and bombed alleys of the souls of those who have passed. It says a great deal about the state of the world, if Death himself is horrified by the actions of men. Through Liesel's story,Death is given reason to believe that the human race is worth something. These are kind people, downtrodden people, who remain kind in the face of adversity. While the story is about war, the author manages to also show us the human-ness of it too. Of how, people in the face of adversity, still hold on to their humanity, of how people still hope and love, when the cruel world gives them more reason to hate. This book shows us through the characters lives that living is more than existing.<br /><br />Death is depicted with a poetic eloquence,that the author should be applauded for. Another personal favorite quote from the book on page 350 is \\" I say His name in a futile attempt to understand. \\" But it's not your job to understand. \\"That's me who answers, God never says anything. You think you're the only one He never answers?\\" Who among us hasn't felt that?\\"<br /><br />This is one of those books that will keep creeping back in your mind after you finish it, I know it will be in my heart and mind forever. Reading The book Thief may have changed something fundamental in my soul. I certainly hope so.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I've read a few of Neil Gaiman's other works and enjoyed them immensely, although I'll admit that I haven't gotten around to reading \\"[[ASIN:0380789035 American Gods]]\\" or \\"[[ASIN:0060515198 Anansi Boys]]\\" at the time of this review. In fact, the only book of his marketed to adults that I've read is \\"[[ASIN:0061689246 Stardust]].\\"<br /><br />This makes \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" an odd duck. While it's being marketed as an adult novel, with the exception of a couple of suggestive scenes, it has a very young adult feel to it. Or, if anything, like the kind of young adult novel that gets banned from school libraries in the southern states for those suggestive scenes.<br /><br />Told through the memories of a middle-aged man remembering the story through the eyes of his 7-year self, \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" follows him as he befriends Lettie Hempstock and her family, who are...different. Different in that they seem to exist in our world and in others at the same time. When a being from another world/reality begins to meddle in ours, Lettie and the boy set out to stop it, but the adventure leads to worse and even life-threatening problems.<br /><br />Again, this book is odd in that I'm not sure exactly who Gaiman's target audience really was. Don't get me wrong, it's still a wonderful modern fairytale, but at the same time, there are mixed messages about who this book is for. It feels like a cross between \\"Stardust\\" and \\"[[ASIN:0060530944 The Graveyard Book]].\\" Not a bad mix, but still confusing. In that regard, this book has strong literary merit, in potentially reigniting the ongoing debate about what makes a young adult novel different from an adult novel. First, the protagonist is a child, as his is close friend. Secondly, and probably unfairly, it is a sort of fairytale. That, in and of itself, doesn't make a young adult novel, but it does carry a stigma of being for younger readers. However, Gaiman crosses the line to adult novel with sexually suggestive scenes involving the boy's father and the nanny, Ursula Monkton. This is probably a debate that would better be discussed by literary scholars rather just a reviewer, but it is something to consider.<br /><br />The characters themselves are interesting. While the boy is generally not the most likable of characters and is rather cowardly, he does redeem himself, and more importantly, he's identifiable. His serious flaws actually make him supremely real in a way that most people will likely find themselves identifying with him at some point in their lives. The Hempstocks are a classic mythological archetype, whether you want to consider them the Fates, the Norns, or whatever, but they work well in this way and in their relationship with each other and the world. If I have to fault the characters at all, it's that the parents of the boy come off as supremely unlikable, to put it mildly. The come off as cold and uncaring about the boy. There's not much, if anything, to redeem them, and I would have liked a tad more development on those characters to at least make them less problematic.<br /><br />It's still a short and charming story, although not as charming as \\"Stardust.\\" It has interesting characters and a wonderful story that's definitely worth taking a look at.<br /><br />\\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" earns 4 buckets of ocean out of 5.ggestive scenes involving the boy's father and the nanny, Ursula Monkton.

B00962341U|5.0|The CD was so much better than I imagined. I hated that I couldn't just buy it on my phone, but I love the hardcover. The songs were so upbeat and pretty different and it came within the time limit that amazon predicted.

Does Dr. Francis Collins at NIH know about this program and it's potential for lowering calorie consumption and thereby improve the health of our very overweight American populace?  3.

B00AZMFJYA|5.0|If you are a Star Trek fan you will LOVE it; if you are just ok with Star Trek, you will still enjoy it. Lot's of great special effects but it also includes a story line..which some action movies seem to forget. There is humor and friendship & secret government dealings.. something for everyone. I love all the Star Trek movies but this one was a delight..I love the new Spock & Kirk..very believable and human (Sorry Mr. Spock, it wasn't mean as an insult)
B00BWLKTOS|2.0|I thought when the title said The Piano Guys,  it would be two guys playing piano.  Wrong, the is a lot of string instrument music.  I gave the CD to a friend who likes that kind of music.

1476729085|5.0|I had a wonderful time reading this novel. It raised some really tantalizing questions for me about how people as a culture learn to pick up on signals from each other, and what happens when someone on the autism spectrum is struggling to reach out to  the norm. Don is a new kind of underdog. In his own inimitable way, he guides himself into the world of human culture. I cheered for Rosie and Don, as they reached for each other across the (penetrable) divide of the autism spectrum, into each other's most natural, spontaneous lives, together.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A great app to keep your mind active and challenged. It lets you start with the 5x5 puzzles that are great for learning how to solve them without too much frustration, then proceeds to add tougher ones. Still making my way through them and loving it.<br />,

B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|I heard \\"Royals\\" and I immediately sought out the artist. After listening to a few clips, I was determined this would be a great album! The songs I have on repeat are Ribs, Buzzcut Season and Gore & Gory. It's been a long time since i found an album I could listen to the whole thing without having to skip tracks. The poetry is beautiful. This is a sensory experience. I hope she continues to make great music.

B004A2V3K0|1.0|I tried to download the Twitter version of Bon Jovi Greatest Hits and it errored.  I have not found a way to contact anyone about this so I guess that means I'm out the 5.00. It's not about the money...  It's about the fact I have no recource.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I am not going to give away anything plotwise for those who haven't seen this movie yet but my advice to everyone is to watch \\"The Avengers\\" before watching this one.  The reason for this is because the movie frequently references things that happened there and they will make more sense to the viewer.  It at least sticks with canon where the films are concerned.  While \\"The Avengers\\" isn't necessarily \\"Iron Man 2.5\\", there are things that happen to the Tony Stark character in that film that come into play in \\"Iron Man 3\\".<br /><br />(Personal side note, I purchased the single disc DVD, just because that was in my budget.  I would have preferred Blu Ray but I am one movie fan who doesn't really nitpick about formats.  I will watch a film on VHS if I want to see it bad enough.)<br /><br />That notwithstanding, it is still a great film on its own.  If you want to see Robert Downey Jr. a LOT, this film will NOT disappoint you in that department, nor will you feel cheated out of special effects galore, stunning and jaw dropping stunts, and great stuff all around.<br /><br />Ben Kingsley is hilarious.  There are many instances where you laugh out loud in this film.<br /><br />It is an all around entertaining way to spend two hours and eleven minutes.<br /><br />The story takes place around Christmas time, which surprised me that it was a summer film.  I guess Paramount figured it would be a better time to launch the third film in the franchise.  It isn't technically a \\"holiday\\" film anyway, but in any case, Paramount studios dominated movie theaters when this first came out and then \\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\\" started playing a week or so later and they ran concurrently there for a while..then \\"Star Trek\\" got released for home viewing first.<br /><br />One last thing.  Watch all the way through the credits.  Like the previous two movies, there is an \\"Easter egg\\" that hints to what may or may not happen if a fourth film ever gets made.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film and ultimately having a good time while watching a movie is the most important thing.mately having a good time while watching a movie is the most important thing.
B0048P4TIM|5.0|There are a number of excellent versions of Aida available, including those conducted by Solti (Price, Vickers), Karajan (Tebaldi, Bergonzi), Maazel (Pavarotti) and Serafin (Callas, Tucker).<br /><br />This is my favourite recording included star cast Montserrat Caballe, Placido Domingo, Fiorenza Cossotto, Piero Cappuccilli and Nicolai Ghiaurov accompanied by the New Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Riccardo Muti. The recorded sound is clear and deep with a good balance between the soloist and the orchestra. Montserrat Caballé is excellent as Aida, giving the role the required drama. She is exquisite in her trademark hushed moments. Placido Domingo, singing the role of Radamès, is consistently good with his superbly dramatic voice. The many duets between the two lead singers are simply amazing.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Finally came in & got to set it up. Very easy to use & fun if your using the chrome browser. It wont replace the Apple tv, Little Black box but will be used along with them. For the price cant go wrong.
0440246024|5.0|This book was fantastic - I listened to the audio version, which was wonderful, and it was beautiful! I kept waiting for the usual exciting legal thriller stuff to start, but it really was a book about the main character's life. i loved it.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This book reminds me of childhood Times when the mystery of life combined dream and fantasy. It was sometimes hard to remember if a memory was of a real or an imagined place. Great book, only wish it lasted longer!

B003405MF6|2.0|Cheesy string arrangements. Uninspired guitar. Jeff phoned this one in. As a loving and venerating fan I can only say that Jeff should have cared more about the final product. This is a profound departure from his greatest (Blow By Blow/Wired) and is lifeless as a mannequin
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|My daughter loves this!!  The kits directions are easy to follow and we were able to make all the different styles in the first sitting.  My daughter is 7 and once I showed her how to do it, she was able to make a bunch for her friends.  While it's marketed to the girls it is a fun favorite of the boys too!!
B0081BU42O|5.0|I've read all of the science fiction works by Iain M. Banks and I've enjoyed five or six of them. His last two books have been very good but their themes have been linked to his tragic early passing. Unlike many of his books this one doesn't have 250 or so unnecessary pages. It sticks mostly to the point and keeps the dialogue and action flowing quickly. It reminds me of Excession as the machinations of the Minds are as obviously important as the actions of the characters. This is high class space opera without a bad novella hiding within it. Highly recommended for Banks fans ands those wanting to try reading within the Culture universe.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|4/13/14<br /><br />So after originally deciding that I would not purchase anything due to the expense. I caved in and ended up buying acorns. The first time it was fine. Every time I have tried to purchase since then the game crashes and kicks me out of the game. It restarts and the timer on the bottom of the acorns to show they are on sale goes crazy. If you contact gameloft nothing gets resolved within the game and you can wait for weeks before they respond whether they will refund you if you completed the purchase after kicked off to supposedly complete the purchase. I stopped contacting gameloft and when I contacted amazon directly I got my money back the same day. I love Amazon customer support but gameloft needs to get with the program.If you have a problem and end up without the acorns or coins that you purchased send a msg to gameloft to let them know but immediately contact Amazon to get your money back.<br /><br />Original review.<br />I do love the game and haven't spent any money so far. However, if you want a large village or lots of animals you will want to spend money on \\"coins\\" or \\"acorns\\" to be able to expand. Meaning while at first you will be able to expand your town or village the prices increase in price of \\"coins\\" as time goes on and affording expansion becomes a problem.  Contrary to the current economic situation it seems the price of property on ice age village is going up. Since my salary hasn't gone up I will try not to spend any money on the game. To keep myself from doing that I turned off the in game purchase feature.
0446614459|5.0|I am one that started to read David Baldacci after I watched the TNT King and Maxwell series.  As always, books are better than the movie or series altho I think this TNT series is really good.  I love the rapport between the two characters.  I am going to want to read the entire series.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I loved this book and all of it's companions, it has romance, adventure, science fiction, alternate histories, special powers and a great heroine who eventually learns to kick ass. What more could you ask for? Deeper meaning and commentary on the human condition? Actually there's a bit of that in there too...

B002AF4Y9G|3.0|There are few directors as controversial as Oliver Stone, and few as uneven.  He reminds me of a more commercial Terence Malick, a man who often allows his own passions and visions to step in the way of his better judgment, creating films that feel intimately connected to the fabric of his talent and yet somewhat off, somewhat imperfect.<br /><br />`Natural Born Killers' is just on the cusp of greatness for me, a film that could have been something unforgettable (well, it is rather unforgettable to be completely honest) had it just had a slight tweak here or there.<br /><br />Where Malick's `Badlands' took a more natural progression of themes, `Natural Born Killers' jumps right into the core of this `message', thrusting us into the celebrity of this story almost immediately.  Maybe that is the reason I'm hesitant to call this a great film, and merely settle on it being a good one.  The film just lacks that restraint needed to make the impact all the more effective.  That isn't to say that the overwhelming idea of global worship of the rebellious carnage created by these two individuals is effectively unsettling, because it is, but the film delves so deeply into that aspect that it almost turns itself into a caricature.  It becomes too stylized and too self-aware, giving us large heaping piles of black comedy that the seriousness of the whole exercise becomes lost in the shuffle.<br /><br />There are just too many ideas floating here, and not a single character is simple.  It would be one thing to have the crazy couple at the center of the story, but on top of that you have the crazy parents and the crazy cop and the crazy reporter and by the time you're done watching the film you're wondering if you are, in fact, crazy.<br /><br />But like I said, this film is right on the cusp of greatness because it actually has a lot going for it.  In fact, I can see how every single aspect of this film would make sense, on its own.  For me, `Natural Born Killers' is the perfect example of too much of a good thing making something that just isn't great.example of too much of a good thing making something that just isn't great.

B00F2J2LRE|1.0|Cher is a versatile, virtuoso powerhouse legendary vocalist...this album is way beneath her. It is barely melodic (a little better towards the end - to be fair) and she is far and away so much better than this album will allow her to be. Horrid production. It's like an album of \\"Believe\\" back-to-back-to-back...ad nauseum... that was a good one time in its time... Now that is teeny bopper domain: the Britneys, Mileys, and other has beens of the future...

B00EMAGCJM|1.0|Miley is actually talented. \\"Wrecking Ball\\"' has some enjoyable licks - from the guitar - not from the overdone, played to death mouth of the singer... The rest of this stuff is techno predictable sound-alike blah... She could actually have taken the world by a bigger storm, and would last far longer had she just grew up, remained confident and just started recording stronger songs...let the music speak...show the real gift of voice... Instead, we get recycled, contrived, outdated, pretentious, insincere stuff that will not last. Too bad. People see through that. You haven't captured a bigger and broader audience Miley, you have just sold yourself to a new group of teeny boppers - and actually have ended up right back where you didn't want to be. Seems like you sold your soul along the way too - and losing yourself is never successful.

B001BANK32|4.0|This is one of my favorite novels. I read it 20 years ago in middle school and then recently reread it on Kindle to get ready for Dr. Sleep. I read this book outside on a beautiful humid sunny day in Iowa (I am middle aged) and it scared the jeepers out of me. It scared me more now than it did when I was a kid because I understand the plot and other elements of the book so much more. There are already over 1000 reviews on Amazon for this book so I won't digress into a long review about the plot. My favorite character is Halloran. I wasn't too happy the Kubrick movie gave him a quick and unseemly demise. If you watched the Kubrick movie and it scared you, the novel is even scarier!
B00EQ30RVY|5.0|It's only five songs but it damn good and it leaves you wanting more !Chester is doing a great job! Scott what's his name might not think so though
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|Dean Koontz meets Twilight meets homage to AA. I have to wonder if this book was really written by SK. The beginning with RM 127 ghost and Halloran was good. I think SK put that in so us diehard The Shining fans would not reject the rest of book. It felt like a bait and switch. I won't go over the plot since there are so many reviews of the plot already. If you are a fan of The Shining, you will probably want to read the book regardless of the reviews but don't have high expectations. This book reminded me of Koontz Servants of the Twilight that I read eons ago in high school. It was difficult for me to like the older Danny and I found it hard to be motivated to read the book.<br /><br />Spoiler: The happy ending, it was really annoying and a disappointment. The ending is like a young adult novel . . . seriously. I think SK in his old age must be getting to be like the horror Mr. Rogers in the Neighborhood. The ending was just too nicey nicey, happy happy, lets all hold hands and sing kumbiya. Was SK writing this book for tweens? Ironic since SK hated Twilight. And the terrible thing that twists Danny's gut for 3/4 of the book is like nothing, so he woke up drunk and stole his pickup's money, ok like that's the most terrible thing in the world. OMG, laughable. The creativity and imagination is thoroughly lacking. I wonder if SK got this from one of his AA meetings.<br /><br />The book itself was predictable. SK did have a few surprises up his sleeve but I think it didn't make up for the predictability. Overall, a good read but a disappointment as a sequel to the master The Shining, which I think is probably SK's best novel. I hope this will end the \\"sequels\\" for The Shining which did not need a sequel.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|as the oldest in the family , I an understand the need to take care of  everyone's problems while ignoring my own needs. THis story was all too real to me..
B00BXI26XC|1.0|Will not let me see the airport by my house very disappointing this app shows 500 planes in the air how can one pinpoint one plane with 500 in the air
B001DJLCRC|5.0|i would tell any one interested in the show that they should watch the first season. they will want to see what happens next!!!!
B005S9EJ46|5.0|OK, I ordered this movie and want to order several others.  I have gift card balance, but everytime I try to order something I get into a loop of signing in and reselecting what I want.  How do I check out?  I've tried signing in and get thrown back into the sign in loop.  After I sign in my cart goes back to empty.  Any suggestions?  Hell, I'd even settle for a help address, but everytime I get to that I have to sign in.  Guess what happens next?  I get back into the loop and have to sign in again.  Is Amazon still in business, or am I out?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. It is so cute and the minion costumes are even more adorable. I recommend this game for anyone who likes the minions from despicable me.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|This movie by far exceeds any sci-fi movie I have seen of recent. It beats the movie 2012, Transformers movies which I thought 2 and 3 were complete garbage. This movie I can watch over and over again without blinking a eye. It is a must see and a must own. You will enjoy this one from beginning to end. It's a smash! The acting is good, the sound effects on surround sound is amazing, the special effects are awesome, and the story line is very good. I haven't like a movie this good since Rise of the Planet of the apes or Troy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft PE it'd a good game. The good thing is that it's not a waste of money like Pony craft. Minecraft PE is fun to play and it is not a game that will let you down.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I choose this rating because this product is still very new.  If they add other features then it might rock, but til they do, it's not better than apple TV nor it will replace it anytime soon.
B00DH4BL8Q|5.0|I absolutely loved these books.  They really take you into the world of Greek mythology.  I learnt so while enjoying the read
B00ET7EON4|5.0|Not what I was expecting from them - has a definite 80's sound to it - but I like it! R U Mine is still my favorite at the moment, but there are several other candidates I am sure I will move through.
B00EB6ENXO|1.0|I purchased a DVD of this movie with \\"Digital Copy\\". The copy does not download to my computer and is not recognized as a playable copy on my iPad. The interface and download instructions seem like they are from the 1990's in their complexity and lack of the user in mind.
B00322PK2G|5.0|Swiss made, don't have to tell you that swatch watches are really great, I got it for my wife and it's the every day watch for her.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I truly love this game. I have it for over a year. It it is a bit strategic and it puts your skills to the test!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Beautifully written compelling story told through the eyes of Molly, a 17 year old foster child, and Vivian, a 91 year old lady as they sort through boxes in an attic.  It only took me a few chapters to be totally captivated by this book.  Two completely different lives come together and become entwined in the process.  The story moves back and forth through the years and blends together for a wonderful journey.<br /><br />This is a book you don't want to put down and the end leaves you with a very satisfied feeling.  I loved the book and recommend it to all who are even slightly interested in what happened to orphaned children during this time and how they survived the lives into which they were placed.
B0026J8LHM|5.0|I used to be your typical skinnyfat kid. I got this album, and after one uninterrupted play through, I physically transformed into a specimen of the genetically superior Aryan master race.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Im a HUGE Walking Dead fan.<br />I was skeptical of this movie, but let me tell you.. It. Was. Awesome.<br />Story line started within the first 5 minutes of the movie!<br />Def worth the purchase!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|While the Chromecast is great in theory it currently pales in comparison to other similar devices.  Launching with a Netflix App was great but the slow adoption by content providers (especially Amazon) has proven a stumbling block.<br /><br />The lack of a remote is also a bit trying unless you have more than one device capable of interfacing with it.  My Nexus tablet links right to the Chromecast but my Bionic won't.  Having to retrieve my tablet every time I want to do ANYTHING on the Chromecast can be a bit of a hassle.<br /><br />In time the Chromecast will definitely come into it's own but for now you're probably better off avoiding it unless you only use Netflix (and now hulu) for streaming content and also have multiple devices that are confirmed to work with it.
B00BMR4RIG|1.0|It's basically useless. There's no animated Radar, which to me is a must for any worthwhile weather app. The information is just about as basic and minimal as you can get and still call it a weather app. As I said, I got it for free a few days ago and deleted it within an hour due it's lack of usefullness. Some people are complaining of ads, I guess I didn't keep it long enough to notice that, but it makes sense considering it was free.
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|I was hesitant to watch this movie after so many bad reviews from critics and fans alike.<br />I don't really care much what the critics say anyway but when fans give a low rating, I take notice. In this case; I took notice and then just had to watch it to see just what was so bad about it.<br />My conclusion:<br />The people who rated it as bad were probably expecting \\"Agent Smith\\" to kill all the bad aliens and save the day. I think this is the main reason, because tho he has a main part in the movie, he is only equally given screen time with his son on and off the screen.<br /><br />No Agent Smith did not bring out his teeny weeny gun and blast an alien to kingdom come. He wasn't the hero of the day and if you watch it, it is very unlikely that either of them will be the hero.<br /><br />Young Smith gave an excellent performance, and Will as always is top notch. The father/son - general/cadet relationship through this movie was well played. The story is good as well, and if you love sci-fi CGI there is plenty of that...tho I would say perhaps a little too much. The story could have been better with a few twists, but it was well done with what they had.<br />So those who are naysayers are kinda shallow, thinking their hero Will was going to save the boy and the world again. So going into the movie just enjoy it for the story and the acting, not because you had hoped to see another alien thrashing by Will Smith.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a great game and its free what more do you want a good game to play to pass the time away
B005CGI4EG|5.0|what a great deal for the money if you want the collection at a great price get this you will not be dissapointed
B00E687MWQ|4.0|I never got into black metal when it came out and I knew little of Satyricon's black n roll style until I heard this. As it goes this is a good record that's really well produced. If I could get over the growling/ hissing vocals I could really dig it. As it stands - it's one of the better metal discs I've spun lately. Nice job.
B00280LYIC|1.0|great story even for an adult!!  i enjoyed all fhe references to mythology and history.  a really good easy read!
8866135909|5.0|This planner is very well set-up for people that like to have their calendar AND a place to make notes!
B008Y212PI|4.0|Flip Pix Art - Simple Pleasures is an awesome game! It kept me busy for hours...my kids even like to play it and I don't mind because it actually makes them think. I do wish there were some more extra challenging. puzzles :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has a lot of features. Before I got this app I thought it was just one of those games that doesn't have much but since having this game I can't put it down! I can get so much out of this game it's unreal!
1932100660|5.0|Seriously the most informative book on nutrition that I have ever read. I have recommended to many friends already. From a meat and dairy lover, I am now a vegan and will never look back.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is perfect to stream video. I wouldnt use it when your tv is too far from your wireless router... If you plan on viewing your own video just drag and drop the video on a chrome browser.... if you are streaming video just alt+tab to hide it from your computer screen so you wont see both screen
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its pretty cool. I'm not good at it but yeah I'll get the hang of it. Its legit. You guys will love it
B004T4KQJS|3.0|A lot of good info, just still leaves me hanging. I'll just have to do more studying about our origins!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I like that it's different. It has more then one variation of hidden object. The energy goes too fast. I hate waiting for more energy.
B009GN6DT4|5.0|I was very happy with this purchase i made i would recommend it to every one to buy and enjoy!
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I loved it! awesome show can't wait until the next one comes out<br />looking forward to it. keep up the good work
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Lovely views of the planet's beauty.  It is a reminder to take good care of the Earth since it is our only home.
B00000K0EA|5.0|Action, adventures, Love scenes and more are all wrapped up in this james bond movie and more.  Great dvd for the price
0131103628|5.0|This is THE book for learning the C language. While many people may feel C is out of date, it still accounts for about 16% of new code written. With the advent of Linux, C has been given new life. Plus, so many things are written in C and based on it, you have a leg up if you know C to start with.
B003PGNBNY|5.0|Great for parents and teenagers to watch together.  It shows that a teenager life is just as difficult in different family styles we have to live in.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Although I truly have believed this all along. It gives you wonderful tools to help develop your energy and turn into matter.
B0000844M8|5.0|I always loved the story and full of love and life for all ages in the family to watch together.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|This is a great movie but if you stop and really think about what is going on it is not very much of a kids movie.
B004UID2LC|4.0|THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME DON'T LET ANYONE LIE TO YOU I REALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT THESE REVIEWS IM JUST TYPING SO MY NOTIFICATIONS WILL GO AWAY
B004SDSSFY|3.0|I have used Docs To Go since the days of Palm Pilot. There are a couple of things that I did not like. First, their licensing model in the past was that any upgrades to the product required that you buy the full product all over again. It was quite annoying when certain \\"features\\" (ie bug fixes) were only available in the new version. They would constantly release new versions every few months, it seemed. Also, while they do have compatibility with MS Office products it seemed like they were always lacking some key features. Even in this version there are issues with Excel compatibility. Granted Excel and Word are complex products and I can see how it would be hard to have full compatibility on a mobile device.<br /><br />Last but not least, and this may be more of an Amazon issue, is that you must be logged into the Amazon App Store in order to use this product! That's a deal killer for me. I have no idea why this is required and it's a particular problem if you are not connected to the internet where you cannot log into Amazon. So forget about using this on an airplane or anywhere you can't get internet access.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because I feel the Amazon login problem is not a Docs To Go issue.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book.  I loved the different perspectives of each character.  However, I found the story to be unrealistic at times.  It was a little too coincidental, but I don't want to spoil it for other readers.  Overall, I couldn't put the book down, and can't wait for the next one by this author.
0425263916|5.0|This is a great book to read especially if you liked 50 shades of grey! Came on time! The series is great!
B007SGM084|5.0|Excellent I truly enjoyed the read.  The story of their relationship was complete.  Truly happily ever after.  I liked that I could read all three together.
0425263924|5.0|This is a great book to read especially if you liked 50 shades of grey! Came on time! The series is great!
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|Great movie. i dont know why so many sayit isnt good. the kid did very good. the story is great.
0425263908|5.0|This is a great book to read especially if you liked 50 shades of grey! Came on time! The series is great!
B003UESJ9M|5.0|Gewnyth's performance in this was superb! I have seen this movie around 25 times! I cry every time! I love Leighton Meester because she is so talented and is in G.G! I now have started to watch Nashville! I am addicted!!!! Thank you movie for making me love country music and shows about country music!!!!
B008XBCJ34|1.0|The idea of the Avatar was \\"borrowed\\", or because I did not notice any references, stollen from Poul Anderson's \\"Call me Joe\\". Read the novel, it is so much better than this Hollywood's reheated leftovers.
B0083Z614S|3.0|It's a good book but so much was left out. I loved the movie and as I read the book it all came back to me. Wish the book was as good as the movie
0345803507|5.0|Im not big on romance books, But I absolutely loved reading these books!!  Also if your looking for another fix after finishing these books Sylvia Day's Crossfire novel's are great!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a fun game that is great for unwinding, but still requires to use your brain.  Great problem solving game for my daughter.  She loves it.
0345803493|5.0|Im not big on romance books, But I absolutely loved reading these books!!  Also if your looking for another fix after finishing these books Sylvia Day's Crossfire novel's are great!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addictive. It starts out very simple and grows more challenging each level. Drives you crazy when you can't quite complete a puzzle but,just keep trying until you get it.
B0026RHR6K|5.0|This is a must have for BSG fans.  The display is nice, and the show is great.  While the show is currently available on Netflix, it may not always be on there.  So this set is worth picking up.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|It's all the Harry Potters...in a single set...in HD - need I say more? Amazon had the best price I could find and it arrived quickly (of course).<br /><br />My 7 y/o and I have thoroughly enjoyed working our way through this set - it's been a neat bonding experience. Harry's tale obviously became darker and more intense the further it went on. I deliberately held off on getting this set until I felt my 7 y/o could grasp most of the material...and not be too freaked out by the scary stuff. I wouldn't personally show it to any kids under 7ish - but your kids (and child rearing techniques) may vary.<br /><br />I can't really comment on the special features, etc...we've only focused on the actual movies so far.
B00C50NV2C|5.0|Nothing like playing COD and MLB in SimulView on my 70 in Sony TV.  Multiplayer gaming while still having the full 70 in. display is awesome.<br /><br />If you have the set up - TV, PS3, game - that allows for SimulView, this is definetly worth the $15-20 for a pair of glasses.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|These three CDs and DVD are a treasure!  They tell a story of the band,  the crew, and their fans you can't get anywhere else. The music is lofty and the images surrounding the music are divine. I highly recommend this box set for anyone who was, is, or wants to be on the bus with The Grateful Dead.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast does everything I needed it too.  It's way easier to use than our now sold Roku and faster.  I know the applications are limited on Chromecast right now, but Netflix, Google Music and stream a tab from a Chrome browser on a computer does everything I need it to.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Easy set up and works well with netflex.<br /><br />Looking forward to the added function of streaming from my computer that is promised.
B00DVKOYBM|3.0|I love to play,  but there are issues with time lags and I'VE BEEN CHEATED OUT OF TOURNAMENT FINALS, more than a few times. Please correct the time issues.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|A fun little movie. Worth the time to watch. If you like this kind of movie you will enjoy this one.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Really great story. Best in series and best story I've read in long time. Read it several times and still enjoy.
B00BMR4RIG|3.0|It's a good app. Let's me know what the temperature is. Obviously. Could be better. But still it's good and has good quality and its easy to use. Some other weather apps usually don't have my city. But this one was good that it did.
1451668945|3.0|I once spurned all of the Mary Higgins Clark books because I felt they were too mundane.  I now appreciate their clear plots and realistic endings.  She does not leave an idea with no outcome.  She writes well and is accurate.  Not too deep, but none the less an easy and satisfying read.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is there favourable game .thank you for making this app<br />It's is very good game for my kids and they love this game
B00004X10B|5.0|Bag is huge and carrys all my lens and other gear! Definely the right bag for someone with a few lens and some gear that wants it all at their finger tips... it been with me camping, to see the new grabd baby, and traveling. I love it!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game needs update and more key when you get caught by the police and one more thing you need more coins when you sign up with Facebook
B005LAIIGW|5.0|Yesterday I went to an IMax theater and saw a movie the likes of something I have never seen before This movie sets a new benchmark in film making. The plot is simple ,the action is plentiful,the scenes are spectacular and the acting is great. This movie is a must see especially on a big screen with 3-D.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much that I wish mojang would make more games like this and being able to change your skin.
B00DJZ06DO|3.0|This movie does not pick up where the previews lead you to believe. It is super confusing and does little to enlighten new viewers as to what is going on. Great artwork but the story raises more questions than it answers. Buy the cheap bootleg before investing in the Blu Ray. If the two are the same, you won't be as disappointmented.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I've had this installed for about 4/5 months now and it's been not sure if it's the app or my internet but it loads at Amazing speed and downloads videos very fast with few fails I recommend this app to anyone at all even if you don't use it much it's very handy.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Please don't make me watch this again!!! My daughter is killing me with this DVD. we have like watched it 10 times
B004TL3R24|3.0|Unfortunately, this didn't come when promised so I couldn't take it on a trip I was going on. On it's own, it works well but I have a sling bag and a backpack, so carrying my tripod with this and either of those bags is a bit difficult. The buckle that attaches to the legs detaches easily and just as easily attaches to the base of the ball head, which keeps it from dangling on the floor.
B005JE1KHE|5.0|Loved this second book of the trilogy. Great reading and hooked from the start.<br />Looking forward to the third and last book in this series.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This was a guilty pleasure, though would be a lot guiltier (and maybe more fun) if the object of the game were to cause the harm rather than prevent it. Admit it, I'm right.<br /><br />My daughter just about passed out from blowing that plane off the screen...<br /><br />If you are into the test-your-brain games, I also like:<br /><br />--[[ASIN:B00COVCV50 4 Pics 1 Word Puzzle]] (there are many versions of this)<br /><br />--[[ASIN:B00F5NWBJU Figure O'Speech]] (visual/word puzzles that suggest names/phrases/titles; unique and fun for lateral thinkers)<br /><br />--[[ASIN:B00EZWPFW2 Unriddle Riddle]] (again, quick and easy to learn, and a good mix of easy and hard)
B005DF2QMC|3.0|Wife had some old cassette tapes that we wanted to preserve and then get rid of the actual cassettes.<br />Installation was easy and the actual recording went fairly smoothly for someone with slightly above average experience with audio equipment. It was a little bit tedious having to sit through all of the cassettes while they recorded, but that's the nature of the beast.
B000002VMD|5.0|GREAT CD,  PLUS,  I Was Seeking It For The GOSPEL Song:&#62; &#34;JESUS LOVES ME&#34; and I Found<br />That Was On This CD and It Sound's GREAT...!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this app very much and play it on every long car ride I take, absolutely love it, and will probably never delete it!
1416595236|4.0|My first Vince Flynn read - also bought Kill Shot but have not read yet - looking forward to it also
B000002URV|4.0|The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, was the cd case is cracked, pretty badly...Could have happened in transit.
0449911357|4.0|I think I read this before but enjoyed it the second time around - but then, i always enjoy Flagg's style and sense of humor
B004LWZW24|5.0|Insidious keeps you on the edge of your seat and leaves you wanting more. Insidious 2 is even better? Loved it
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is one the best hidden object games I've played, and it is combined with puzzles and collectible objects. Pure fun!
0807014273|5.0|I own countless books, and bought this for a friend. I recommend this work to any adult who may be struggling with life's slings and arrows.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I am rereading this book for the second time. I can't think of many books that I actually want to read more than once. Mr. Sanderson completely captured my attention  throughout the entire book!<br /><br />I personally don't care for his early works, but he sold me with how he finished WoT.  I gave this book a chance because of that and am so glad I did!!  This book has easily jumped into my top five books of all time!!
B00CLD65X0|4.0|Compared to the previous two seasons, I found Season 3 of Downton Abbey a slight disappointment.  The outstanding production values and excellent performances continue, but the storyline has declined.  If we fans are honest with ourselves, we acknowledge that this series is at its core a soap opera, superbly executed, but a soap opera nonetheless.  During this season, however, the soap suds seemed to billow as the plot careened from crisis to crisis and heartbreak to heartbreak.  Still, I enjoyed this series and would recommend it to fans of well-crafted period drama.  And I'm already looking forward to Season 4.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|great game!  hours of fun.  always make time to get my Jewel Star time in.  Everyone should give it a try.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King finally did good !<br /> Especially after a string of quickly written and especially unbelievable plot lines. I still think The Stand is his best work.
B009UZBLSG|1.0|My Nexus7(2013)does Not work with Samsung Monitor/HDTV. (Samsung-T22A350)<br />Plug&Play doesn't work.<br />Seller told me only with Philips monitors, wtf ???? on the box it says \\"to any big screen\\".
B004SOR4H6|3.0|This is my third time installing on Kindle Fire. I don't use the Kindle that much except to read anymore since Samsung Galaxy S4 came into my life, but I still want to be able to check social apps here. The Twitter fails more than all the others put together, but I'm trying again. It's good when it works.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved the books, yes a little teenage like at the start but it just got better and better. Would recommend it in a heartbeat.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|You will love this book. I'm a big reader, and if you ever read Eragon, Rangers Apprentice, Pendragon, The fire within, any of these book series will be right up your alley. I am severely in love with peeta, and have reread this series 3 times, because this is just amazing!!!!!
086571701X|5.0|Wow, this was truly an easy to follow, step-by-step guide that can be understood and followed by a novice such as myself.  This is THE book for anyone new to aquaponics.
B002WY65VU|5.0|great watch.  funny cast and we watched it as part of our family pick night.  will watch it again sometime
193700788X|5.0|I just love ALL the Sookie Stackhouse books, they're the best! They're always so interesting, exciting, and sexy! Hope she writes more!
B00CFA222M|5.0|We bought this for our grandson who is mesmerized by this movie! He wants to watch it all the time!
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|Beautifully done version. Visually spectacular as the life Gatsby created for himself. The Ultra Violet gave 2D a 3D look and feel. DeCaprio embodied the broody, moody, dark essence of Gatsby.
B00CHS31DG|4.0|Haven't had a chance to use it much. Still trying to figure out the recorder. Other than that, I like it. Better than the others like it.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|Again, this movie trailer was far better than the movie itself. The trailer showed all the good parts. I would not watch it again!
4789004546|5.0|I feel this is a very good book for beginners, as got information that isn't allways available on the internet
1609611543|5.0|It's an eye opener! I started my gluten free diet and noticed almost instant relief from my allergies. 1st world problems, lol
B0045EPD90|5.0|Love, love, love, love this book. It's a fantastic book, that appeals your interest and doesn't disappoint. I can honestly say this book gave me hope for true love, and a future job. Hope everyone enjoys Love, Rosie. I  know i did!!
B003VANOFY|5.0|the old headset was low cost (cheap) I was always having trouble with my ears due to the set.  I had purchased the G930 for my son he told me I should buy myself the same set, now no ear problems play Skyrim for hours at a time. Thanks to the G930 great sound and fit.<br /><br />Robert Sewell<br />young eighty year old gamer.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|We saw this movie a year ago in the theatre.  It was part of a bundle suggested by Amazon so we got a copy.  It is an enjoyable movie about retired folks facing changes in their lives that come with aging.  We liked it.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|So cool...don't want it to end.  Game is definitely immersive in that it keeps you in that seeking mode.  Keep the gems coming and I'll keep buying them and spreading the word.  Thank you...

B00028HBKM|5.0|In this film Christ was condemned by the &#34;democratic&#34; mob, while few &#34;aristocratic&#34;, more gentle individuals tried to save him. My suspicion is that mercy is an aristocratic value. Democracy is a different, and mercy and honor are often contraindicated to it. Christianity appeals to this &#34;aristocracy of the spirit&#34;, which is a gentle spirit. No wonder that many original Christians and early Christian martyrs were women. We don't need to be Christians to feel for Christ's suffering so graphically depicted in the film. It is violent and it was disapproved by the 'progressives' who believe that the human kind is inherently good. They think only a bad governance or dictators, like Hitler or Stalin, or a tyrant in Rome make it bad. I think Christ's radical message is the reverse. The human nature is seriously tinted and flawed. A real effort is needed to make us love one-another. Not the same tribe or family member - that would be easy - but stranger and the enemy. How is it even possible? We are to love all men because we know we are sinners ourselves. This message is radically different from the organized systems of self-righteousness embodied in nationalism, religious camps, and political parties. This is a not pretty film, but a powerful one.te apparatus to understand its enemy, or even the ally, because the state has already rendered judgement as to the purity of its own intentions. I'd probably have preferred myself a less brutal, slightly more gentle and nuanced film, but I think this is a powerful film.
B002KYHZLQ|2.0|First, I read a lot of high fantasy. In the last three years, I have re-read Tolkein's LoTR (+ Hobbit), all of JRR Martin's Fire and Ice books, Tad Williams' Shadowmarch and the Memory, Sorrow, Thorn (four part) trilogy, Rothfus' Kingkiller books, Durham's Acacia books... In other words I'm not out of my element here or opposed to long slow developing books with large casts of characters.<br /><br />That said, I'm about 2/3 of the way through this book and I don't think I'm going to finish. I still don't really care about a single character in this book, I have no clear understanding of what the book is leading towards or even really what's going on. There are quite a few worldbuilding puzzles (what's a warren really?) that I'm fairly curious about, but there's been such a complete dirth of any exposition, I'm starting to think that I'm never actually going to get any exposition about this world, the characters, the magic, the landscape, the politics... I feel like I'm being led through a world with blinders on and earplugs in. I'm allowed to catch occasional glimpses and occasionally overhear conversations, but none of it is in context and none of it really seems to relate to anything else I've heard or seen. I started taking notes actually to try and sort through who was who, and why they were doing what they were doing, but that exercise only led me to the conclusion that I didn't really care.
0141192437|5.0|Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is one of his many compelling Sherlock Holmes stories. It is constantly filled with mysteries while the reader is taken along the investigation process by Sherlock Holmes and Watson. The process is fascinating in that while all of the Sherlock Holmes stories have a mystery to be solved, each mystery is completely different causing a rich and new story each time. And on this occasion, Holmes and Watson are investigating a \\"haunting\\" on the Baskerville family tree. However, the haunting is from a large and ferocious hound rather than a human spirit. Watson takes on the mystery by himself only to realize that there are more mysteries, confusions, and dramatic deaths inside of this one main mystery. This causes a very interesting read that will surely intrigue any audience whether you truly like reading or not.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I was so glad I had the opportunity to see the movie on the big screen.  I went alone and the next day my husband joined me.  We decided it was a good one to have at home.  The music, the story line. the acting is all very good.  We are in our sixties now and maybe that is why we found this movie so touching.  We understood what some of the characters were going through.  I laughed and cried.  I'm glad we have it to watch whenever we please.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I wish I had read this book ten years ago when it could have changed my life dramatically. But hey, I'm reading it now and I'm going to declare that this is the time and the war has begun. If you are a creative type and your creativity is making you miserable, you need to read this book and take its principles to heart. It can save you.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|Truly one of the greatest stories ever told. This guy has an absolute un-doable dream. Spoiler Alert: Look at the cover of the DVD, he does it!  This story is all about dreaming big, and making it happen. Oh yeah, there's also that small part about walking a wire (with no net) over 1,000' off the ground!!
B005PK1G76|5.0|Fits my baby jogger city select stroller great. Great price point. You can fold the stroller with the organizer on the handlebars.
B005MMZ63C|4.0|I watched Citizen Kane a few nights ago and found it touching and sad; it reminded me entirely too much of people I've know and the life I lived for a few years. I've worked for a charismatic leader and followed him through the trials and tribulations of the business world; some of the scenes seemed much too familiar for comfort.<br /><br />This is a sad, serious movie that dwells on the strengths and weaknesses of a strong leader and the impact of his decisions on the lives of those who followed him. I had no interest in the technical aspects of the movie and watched it without any thought but to simply experience this famous movie.<br /><br />As I started writing this review I was reminded of the story of the individual who was to see the Mona Lisa for the first time and commented to the guard that he wanted to see if it was as good as everyone seemed to think and was told by the guard that the Mona Lisa wasn't on trial, he was. I feel as if I'm on trial as I write this review. Throwing caution to the wind I decided to go ahead and express my thoughts on the movie.<br /><br />This is a somber, sad, movie that examines the life of a bigger than life individual who had a strong influence on the lives of those with whom he came in contact. I found it interesting, and provocative but will probably not want to watch it again for a long time, if ever.<br /><br />Having worked for several years for a man who was similar to Kane in several ways, I found the movie disturbing and too personal.<br /><br />It is a story that everyone should see at least once and I suspect that most will not share my experience and can view the movie with greater objectivity. May I suggest a first viewing on Amazon Instant Viewing with a decision to purchase to be made after watching it. This may be one you'll want to watch many times.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book captures from the very first page.  It keeps you guessing.  Loved and recommended it to all my friends.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I used to LOVE this app until a recent but &#34;still unknown Update&#34; to the app makes it not compatible with my Kindle. It no longer stays installed on my Kindle and cannot be used apart from a network or WiFi connection.<br />Each niht I have to re-install this on my Kindle to make use of it.<br />Support has not been able to assist as yet.  :-(<br />+++<br />Outstanding app that continues to improve. Additional reading plans, the ability to download certain versions to my device (for use when Wifi is not available), and quality interface all contribute to a this being an outstanding app. I especially enjoy using the audio portion for my Bible reading during drive-time. Redeem the time!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This excellent tale underscores how every choice one makes has an impact on everyone else. There are no secrets. There are no isolated events.  No rationalization can change that fact.<br />Moriarty does a brilliant job of intertwining the various relationships in this book. She shows incredible psychological sophistication in relaying the thoughts and feelings of her characters.
B00AZMFJYA|2.0|The movie itself is not bad. The character of Khan is different, but it was ridiculous to actually lift dialogue from \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\\" into this film. I also have issues when there are 'stunts' which are out of the realm of possibility. Anyhow, the thing I have the most problem with this DVD is that THERE ARE NO EXTRAS!! This DVD has the movie and nothing else. No making of documentary, no deleted scenes, no interviews. This is highway robbery. Now whenever it is re-released with extras, I will have to shell out money to get what should have been released initially. The Blu-ray version has the extras. I feel cheated. If you don't care about extras, you can get this edition. Otherwise, you might want to wait and hope for a follow-up edition.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I downloaded my MP3 music library onto an SD card, popped into the Soundfly and installed this unit in my 2012 Nissan Sentra.  The unit will fit in either of the power receptacles of the Sentra.  Tuned the FM radio to an &#34;empty&#34; station, programmed it into the FM receiver, and then tuned the transmitter of the Soundfly to the same frequency.  Set it to &#34;shuffle&#34; and that's it!  The sound is great.  The unit powers down fine when the car electrical is shut down; meaning it picks right back up at the beginning of the song file that was playing when the car is started after shut down.  The only problem I've noticed is that the soundfly will produce some RF interference if you tune to another FM station while the Soundfly is energized; maybe IF transference.  In any event, you can either turn the Soundfly off or just unplug it from the power receptacle if you want to listen to broadcast FM.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this product.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very real feelings. I felt at times I was re living the loss of my husband to sarcoma of all things  just like Gus.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This should be a must read for everyone in their twenties who think they know where their life will lead them
0385743564|5.0|This book was short and easy-to-read, but still contained all the awesome I've come to expect from Brandon Sanderson. It was the perfect length and complexity; easy enough to digest during a busy semester at school, but there was enough meat to feel very satisfied at the end. Definitely recommended reading.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|I loved the movie and it was great that it came out so soon. I have been waiting for it to come. Hope you get more updated movies out as fast I don't go to the theaters I wait for them to come to amazon. Thanks
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I've always loved the story and the Broadway soundtrack, but I wasn't prepared for this.  Every last bit of dialogue was sung.  This just bugged me for some odd reason.  Just not my thing.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is just a great way to watch things from the internet on our big screen TV. Love this devise!
B005H9B2CE|3.0|This movie was made for Thor fans, and that's fine. But for somebody who had never been exposed to the Thor comics, the movie is tough to follow. There are a lot references that aren't explained fully. It's hard to get lost unless you are already familiar with the universe.<br /><br />I will say, continuity references aside, there's a lot to like about this movie. The special effects really work. This movie makes great use of CGI effects with Thor's homeworld and the rainbow bridge. Stunning.<br /><br />The acting and characterization of Thor and Loki were also better than they deserved to be for a film with such a silly premise. The relationship between Thor, Odin, and Loki is actually a wonderful depiction of a twisted royal family. Unlike in Avengers, Loki is portrayed as a complex villain with deep motives. The human characters, unfortunately, were forgettable.<br /><br />Overall, this is probably my favorite of the Superhero movies, aside from the original Iron Man. Overall, 3.5 stars.
0882847953|5.0|Upon receiving this book, it was in mint condition and the packaging was of good quality as well. I bought this book because as a musician, I know you can't get far without really knowing your scales and theory just like you probably won't be good at, really, ANY genre without knowing about syncopation. Although the title is directed towards drummers, anyone who plays ANY instrument should invest in this book. It will not only help you as a performer, but also in terms of personal expression and comprehension.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is a page turner for sure.  The John Corey books contain humor interspersed with  the action.  If you like DeMille you will enjoy this one.
B00FF8OKJE|2.0|Your typical build app, You can build troops and fight CPUs and real life opponents online. It's very slow and very tedious and not fun to play at all. Would not recommend.
B0042HOTRW|4.0|For an excellent review of this Lego City 3368: Space Centre, I believe Mr Chris Hall has done a great job! So for more details please see that review, for my part I really liked this set and it does not disappoint. There are a few other similar themed products out there by Lego; namely a Space Buggy, a small Satellite Launch set, but to name a few. So with a little extra Lego and imagination this set can be expanded upon. For Lego enthusiasts' young and old this is a highly recommended purchase.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This was a fun game for me and for my three young grand children.  At each level they were able to they were able to be proud of their skills.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great read. I would have given it 5 stars, but the ending was a bit weak. I definitely do recommend it though.
1616550414|5.0|I havent finish reading it but i liked it a lot , its all  i expected . If younare a fan younshould get it
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I loved this movie as a child and am so glad that I am able to share it with my children now. Lots of laughs!
B003JCZLRS|5.0|In process of reading, saw parts of the movie so wanted to read the book, and the Aubrey/Jack comparison is thought provoking
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have  been reading King for 30 plus years, and I believe this is the best read ever. It was also nice to fill the years from The Shining until present day. Thanks for this work Mr. King.
B005HSL626|3.0|This was a fun game when we first got it.  The kids enjoyed blowing off some steam by wacking all the fruit.  But it didn't keep their interest as long as some of the other games.
158270208X|5.0|I chose this book as follow up to the secret and the magic, and love the look and feel of the book. The quotes get me started in thinking positively every morning, and writing down things I am grateful for every morning starts my day out right. I find every day is more meaningful when I start it out counting my blessings, and writing down my gratitude list makes my thoughts more concrete
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved this book. John Grisham<br />is a master story teller and the twists keep coming with this great suspense novel.
B004H1V5RU|3.0|This item is an awesome game.  I've played them before and ordered one for myself.  The one that game in the mail had a broken part on the inside that ruined the course.<br /><br />I have worked in distribution for years.  This item, by nature, is very sensitive and needs to be packed a certain way.  Amazon failed to do this and I had to send the item back.<br /><br />I recommend spending the extra 5 bucks and buying it in a retail store, where you can visually inspect the item before purchasing.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Am deleting app from my device. Updated app is terrible. Background pic too intrusive and makes info hard to read. They dropped the UV index from the current conditions which was important to me. New app too cluttered, confusing, and not user friendly. Would give ZERO stars if possible.
B009GED3HS|5.0|THIS SEASON IS SO AWESOME THAT I HAD TO PURCHASE IT ONLINE. IT IS ONE OF THE FUNNIEST SHOWS I HAVE EVER WATCHED.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Running Time 2hr 10min. HD Sound 7.1 HD Pic Widescreen. This movie is absolutely amazing. You can never get enough of a movie like this! This movie has High end (Avatar) level CGI effects to the 10th power. The money was well spent on this movie. My hats off to all producers involved in this movie, you guys actually got it right! The storyline is filled with awe and intrigue. All actors performed to (A-list) levels. The props, sets, wardrobes, makeup and all effects were amazing. This movie will have you on edge, leaving you wanting more. The fight sequences and combat action alone will captivate you. The premise of this movie is deep beneath the earth a race of Alien  monsters  have lived there since the age of the Dinosaurs, unable to come to the surface until the earths atmospheric conditions were just right. The Monster then would burst up through a hole in the ocean and begin their campaign to exterminate all human infestation and take over our planet. The only way we can fight them is with giant (man-made) Roberts, which are controlled by a (2) person team of pilots inside the robots head. Great movie. Purchase on Blu-ray. This movie is a keeper!
B0091REZMW|3.0|Had a really good time with this game for awhile, but after a couple weeks got totally bored with it. Not bad for the price, but not good for the long haul.
B00FITRTQ6|5.0|Having read the collection of six short stories, \\"Cutting Right to the Chase\\", by this author, I was really curious to dive into her next book \\"Into the Killer Sphere\\". I found the protagonist, Chase, already quite charming from the start, from the glimpse I got from the short stories, so I was interested to see how he would deal if he were presented with a beefy case, not a small ordinary crime, but a real murder.<br /><br />Well, I was not disappointed! Inspector Alumni needs to figure out who killed Piero Galli and calls for the help of Chase, who reluctantly agrees. As Chase is not a police officer, his role is more of a background one, or at least, that's what it seems. Still, he has the ability to ask the right questions to the right people at the right time, and this includes the suspects, the forensics team, his own colleagues. I had the impression that for a guy who was called in to 'give a hand' he was actually doing more than his fair share. He's clearly a dedicated hero, someone who truly cares about finding the truth.<br /><br />I was trying to picture who the murderer was from the start, and even when there was a second attempt at killing, I was far from the truth. The end was a surprise for me and I was really fascinated by how Chase had managed to figure it all out, from such small clues, and put all the pieces of the puzzle together. This was a great book, I will definitely want to read more about Chase and further cases he will have to solve in the future.
0440246318|5.0|Another great novel by Lee Child. A must read for Reacher fans...this one does not disappoint. A plenty long book that keeps your interest the whole way through, plus a short story at the end about Reacher.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I always enjoy Sanderson's writing, it flows easily with identifiable characters and original story lines. My only complaint is having to wait for the next instalment. I can't wait for &#34;Words of Radiance&#34;! Next.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. I do like some of the actors in it. It was entertaining and very interesting. Different.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked this story right up to the end. I prefer a book that wraps up the plot but I felt that this one just left it too open.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was about to give up on the book before Go's advice for a \\"Wooden Anniversary Present\\" on page 20.<br /><br />The book is readable and enjoyable.  The plot reminded me of a Stephen King novel.  The dual voice timeline reminded me of--everything published post-Lost, or Underworld (DeLillo).  The over-abundance of ironic references were a little boorish because they reminded me of David Spade.  On the whole, I would say the book is a wee bit derivative.  Although, using derivative as a criticism (just criticism, not a criticism, I learned that from Amy) is in and of itself....
0385349947|2.0|Ms. Sandberg- Be the Change You wish to See. How about using your power and millions to be an advocate for change so that women feel safe and able to make the suggestions you speak of. I'm sure the single mother (that raised me) would really want to &#34;take on more responsibilities&#34; and &#34;take risks&#34; if she weren't so exhausted after working 50 hours a week. Then to come home, make dinner, help kids with homework and drop into bed each night utterly exhausted but awake with worry as to how you will pay all the bills on 12$/hr, buy my brother's braces and new tires for your little beat up 20 year old car. I don't know how she did it. My Mom didn't have the benefits of well-connected, wealthy parents or an ivy-leaugue education, but she taught me by example that I needed an education and better be prepared to support myself. I worked through college and eventually owned my own business. But having come from the school of hard knocks, I would never dream of acting as smug and self-righteous as Ms.Sandberg. I would have had more respect for this book if she were to truly educate herself as to why women are leaving the workforce and are less likely to implement her suggestions.  I could respect her if she would use her voice, power and millions to be an advocate for women-- perhaps fight for available, adequate and affordable childcare? Flex-time? Paid family leave? A true living wage? The last thing women need is another rich, clueless, self-righteous person condemning us- we have politicians for that. I want my money back.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is an amazing version tho it's not as updated as the computer version it's still truly great with a few updates this game will be #1 on the app store
B0013SQP66|1.0|This series likes to shock its audience with offensive scenes or acts.  I don't care to be entertained in that way.
B00915G6MG|5.0|This has become an annual must-have gift for my wife. She has taken up dancing on a drill team for those 50 and over and had to miss many episodes. This got us up to date before the new season premiere (and her dance times changed so she can catch it on its first braodcast). Fun extras too!
B000AP04FG|4.0|The FUNNY scenes in this movie are pretty outrageously FUNNY!!!  There is definitely CHEMISTRY between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and it works so well to this movie's advantage!  The story is fun, light-hearted and never takes itself seriously.  They are both spies, but don't know it because they work for opposing agencies.  Each has made up a cover story to tell the other when they get married, and Jolie even hires actors to play her parents.  When they discover their true identities, all Hell breaks lose, and we have the fun of seeing the results.  I recommend going along for this ride!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Only wish for easier ways to obtain potions and spells. I never played many games which required  strategy. I find it very frustrating but enjoyable.
B005DF2QMC|3.0|This is a great tool to convert from my old tapes into my computer. the bad thing is that this tape player with a usb jack cant record and I can use it a tape recorder. Good product anyways.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game. It is so great. Having fun with it. I like that it collects money even when you are not playing.
B007P06DOK|5.0|...and did that ever remind me what a gem this CD is! There are some bonus tracks as well, for us to harmonize with:)
B009AY04A8|5.0|I absolutely loved this game. Not too hard or too easy. Loads of fun for me and my daughter. I would recommend to anyone who loves these types of games.
0812982622|5.0|I laughed.  I cried.  I stared catatonically at the ceiling.  I laughed some more.  I shook uncontrollably.  I glanced nervously over my shoulder.  I jumped on hearing knocking at the door.  More laughter.  I stopped eating.  My hair fell out.  I rubbed my eyes but couldn't scrub the mental images.  I read the final page and collapsed in exhaustion.  Then looked out my window and saw the sun was shining.  Heard a bird or two chirp.  Neighbors playing with their kids.  Thanked God I live in a free (albeit flawed) country.  Got on a bus, and went to work.<br /><br />All true except for the laughter part.  (Technically, didn't cry either.  Not much of a cryer, but Lord knows TOMS has no end of tear-jerking moments.  Also exaggerated the hair bit -- mine's long since fallen out already...)<br /><br />You -- if you've already read this novel -- may find my attempt at levity here either lame or inappropriate.  No argument.  It's just that TOMS is an unremittingly dark reading experience, almost suffocatingly so, and having just emerged from under it this morning I'm finding it necessary to remind myself that there is still humor in the world -- even lame inappropriate humor.<br /><br />There is nothing -- NOTHING -- at all funny about this novel.  Technically, I suppose, there's a lot (to do broadly with the nobility of the human spirit [certain humans' spirits at least]) that is inspiring in this novel.  But even the inspiring bits get pretty much trampled under jack boots or effectively lobotomized through one or another means of exquisite torture.  And so, too, is the reader tortured along the way.<br /><br />That is not to criticize this novel or its author though.  TOMS is, as many readers have rightly noted, a brilliantly written and brilliantly realized novel.  It impressed me no end from start to finish.  Reading it called to mind another extraordinary recent read of mine: A Constellation of Vital Phenomena.  That, too, was a darkly brilliant read.  To this reader, TOMS suffers in comparison.  Whereas ACoVP was pure poetry, TOMS is brilliant writing of a different -- and to my ear -- less striking sort.  Nonetheless, Johnson is an enormously talented writer, and TOMS is an enormously ambitious novel.  For anyone seriously interested in the modern novel (not to mention the modern totalitarian state) TOMS is essential reading.  Though I did not \\"love\\" reading it myself, I profited enormously from doing so.  It has my highest recommendation.
B006DGOV9Q|1.0|This battery has to be charged at least twice a day. Worse than the original Samsung battery that came with my Samsung Galaxy after using it for more than one year. This battery cannot be a real Samsung battery.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|I wish someone at Skywalker Ranch could have placed all editing hardware/software out of George's reach...<br />Other than that, very happy that my son is finally a fan
B007SGLZP8|4.0|3 stars was a little generous, but I did find it a good read. I will be reviewing it for my book club.
B000002MIF|5.0|I think that what makes this album cool is that the Smiths chose their favorites for Hatful of Hollow. There are some greatest hits compilations for which the group wasn't consulted (or so they said). Johnny Marr is phenomenal on guitar; Morrisey's voice is haunting.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|very easy to use  easy to order books and downloads them immediately so I can read them within seconds of ordering
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book is a wonderful tapestry, weaving together a fascinating world and the story threads of many colorful characters.  It should satisfy anyone who loves epic storytelling, new worlds (and their maps!), and mythic figures.
B00AM7E4LM|5.0|This book show you how to acquire new skills in a practical manner. He applies his principle to the subject matter nicely.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app.  Very useful and easy to use.  Everyone needs to have a  calculator within easy reach and this app fits the bill.
B00CATSONE|3.0|I enjoyed this read and finished in one sitting. I recommend it to fans of Tesla and Edison. This kept my interest.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|i like the game alot.but i wish they would add more things like slender man etc. thats my review and you should get it
B008PWN0I4|5.0|Pros:<br />- It works, and well!<br />- Decent range (10+ Ft)<br />- No batteries required, it utilizes your devices battery.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Sound quality is good, not great.<br />- This thing is so tiny you might lose it easily.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Have read everything Stephen King. I faded out for awhile, but this one brought me back!<br />Bring it on Mr King
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|one of the best games I have played in a really long time!! I keep coming back to play after updates!!!
B0010ZR160|5.0|GREAT ACTING WITH A FEW INTERSTING TWISTS. ONE OF THE MOST SUSPENSEFUL ENDINGS IVE SEEN. DEFINITELY A MOVIE THAT WILL STIMULATE CONVERSATION AND MORAL DEBATE.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the book I've read after watching the movie and I wasn't sure I'd finish it, until I started reading and didn't want to put it down. I can't wait to get my hands on the next book in the series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the reason why they cant add them earlier is because this app wasnt mainly made for amazon devices.this is an android device.they cant just stick it all in at once!plus for the people who are stupid and are trying to make there own minecraft app dont! coding isnt as easy as it may seem.they cant just go into pc files take redstone etc. and shove it into the mcpe folders.SO STOP YOUR COMPLAINING!
B0090EHVMC|4.0|Got Kids?  Get Seuss.<br /><br />Nuff said.<br /><br />Well, I guess not!  I needed 14 more words!  It's a good animated movie, in keeping with the Dr. Seuss style.  Not the greatest movie of all time, and not even the greatest Dr. Seuss story.  But It's worth getting (or you can be patient and get it when the price goes down like from a discount bin).
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|the first 2 were so good and this one felt like someone else wrote it. hopefully she will get a clue and end it in the next book in the same quality as the first ones.
B004WR125O|4.0|Worked ok (would establish a 72% connection through a wall at about 15 feet) but my receiver did not have the &#34;wake on network&#34; feature so it was not of much use to me.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|SIMPLY PUT.. SHORT AND SWEET... IF U LIKED THE THING THE FIRST TIME YOU MUST SEE THE PREQUEL. JUST AS GOOD AS THE 1ST.
B006Y9BULE|5.0|I have been a Seiko dive watch fan for years; this is the 3rd generation of dive chrono I've owned, starting with the Sports 100 back in the early 80's.  All have performed flawlessly; this new one (for me, anyway) is really nice. These are big, fairly heavy watches, so understand that before you buy. I like the solar feature, the stems that wind down to seal and the large easy to read hands.  The only thing I would change is to swap the 24 hour function for the alarm function that was on my old one.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|I liked the Summer Sudoku very much & would have given it 5 stars but every so often it would quit in the middle of a game. You could restart it & the game would resume but still irritating.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|I love the temp in the notification bar instead of having a widget. It is a clean look when looking at the full app and the hour to hour break down is easy to read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Downloaded this game for my six year old and I became addicted to it. Great game for kids and adults.
0385523394|3.0|This book really became fascinating when the author was transferred to a maximum security facility. It revealed so much about America and a prison system that is a shattered indifferent mess. That nobody cares about prisoners is obvious but the sub text is chilling. I appreciate the volume of prisoners in the US is staggering and the system cant cope but the conditions described by the author in the last section of the book are almost beyond belief and must surely violate even the most basic of human rights. That the majority of prisoners are African American cant escape notice and is a depressing indictment on a broken and malevolent regime. Prisons should never be privatised. Prisoners are not clients and a private prison has a vested interest in long sentences and recidivism.<br /> I recommend this book highly especially for its insights into the world of maximum security and the preposterous transferring of prisoners all over the country.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Nothing I can say abouy this movie that probably hasn't already been said and heard. One of the 5 best movies ive seen.
098357670X|1.0|wretched, pointless shipping with zero protection, a thin sheet of tissue-thin plastic envelope is all the wrapping, book has creases throughout the entire fragile softcover book, front cover to back cover, up and down every page.
140006922X|3.0|I don't really agree with the author on a lot of points.  He seems to ignore Jesus' loving and forgiving side and, instead, focuses on his anger displayed while turning over the tables in the temple.  While that incident is certainly a large part of Jesus' arrest and subsequent trial and crucifixion, I don't believe that overshadows his ministry of love and forgiveness.
0141345659|5.0|I read the Fault in our Stars by John Green. It is amazing, and great for all ages. The main plot of the story is there is this girl Hazel with cancer, and she meets this boy Gus. They go through so many ups, and downs. They make a lot of choices in life. This is the most addicting book ever. You will not regret it if you decide to read it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I usually try to figure out the ending of the story as I read along but this story has so many twists and turns I did not figure out the ending of the story until I reached the end.  I have recommended this book to others.  I receved the book in a timely fashion and in the condition promised.  I would recommend this seller.

0312965788|5.0|I finally decided to take my mom's advice--many years ago when I was in my teens or twenties, my mom, an English war bride, mentioned that Herriot's books made for pleasant reading. Never what I'd call a true animal lover, I pooh-poohed the idea. Now at age 66, a year after my mom's death, I decided to try All Creatures Great and Small and then see if Herriot's writing was appealing to me. Well, you guessed it; now I wish that I could call my mom and tell her that Herriot kept me interested all the way through despite his descriptions of nature which don't particularly excite me. I now want to go on and read his other books.<br /><br />At first I was a bit let down because after the book begins with the story of him and one of the farm animals in his care, making for very exciting reading, the second chapter gives us some background information and description. I'd been thinking that it would be just one exciting animal story after another. I had to slow down and tell myself that I'd have to be patient--that Herriot wants to tell the whole story--of him, of his boss and his assistant, of the farmers who own the animals, of the English countryside in all its splendor, of the vehicles he is forced to contend with, and the weather he must confront. It's a big story and it's partially autobiographical and partly fictionalized.<br /><br />I came to realize that the descriptions of the people and the countryside help to give the reader some respite between medical encounters with the animals in his care. Your breathing can slow down a bit until the next animal story stimulates your heart and nerves. I will say that the people stories may amuse you. Some of these people, including the hero's boss, are very eccentric to say the least. But I still feel that the animals provide the heart-pounding excitement in the story.<br /><br />I've never been what I'd call an animal lover or a nature lover. In recent years I've been reading many memoirs. So this is a memoir, although somewhat fictionalized, and it contains just enough excitement, beauty, and heart to keep many readers engaged throughout. I've already started reading All Things Bright and Beautiful and just want to say that his recollections bring back memories of my own marriage in the early years. I was moved to tears by the final chapter of All Things Great and Small. Fascinating reading. But I'll say one thing--I could never be a veterinarian!ewhat fictionalized, and it contains just enough excitement, beauty, and heart to keep many readers engaged throughout.

B004SJTSZW|5.0|It seems like this film has not received good reviews and I can't figure out why -- top stars, well written, tense sci-fi thriller content and a great twist at the end!  Well acted with chilling precision by Johnny Depp and Theron holds up well too -- gorgeous as ever.  This is a very good movie, in my opinion, and I bought it!

0811806405|5.0|Purchased this to see what it takes to build a guitar. Amateur woodworking is a hobby and I decided to dabble with being a luthier on top of it. This book is an easy read and easily understood without requiring an engineering degree. Fairly easy to construct a guitar using this book and make a nicer instrument than a cigar box guitar with the finished product. If you have the tools on hand (hand or power tools either one) the steps in this book make it fairly simple to construct a decent to nice instrument depending on your abilities and talent. My first attempt wasn't the best but they're getting progressively better. I would recommend pine or a &#34;cheap&#34; wood so you're not out too much if you mess up rather than a figured wood or veneer for your first attempt...speaking from experience!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It started a little slow, jumping around as it did.  But once it got going, it totally sucked me in and I didn't want to put it down.  The characters were beautifully flawed, believable and I loved them all.  This was the first book I've read by Liane Moriarty--I'm now a huge fan! Can't wait to read more.

B0089LOG02|5.0|An outstanding story of a segment of US history about which little is known. The Orphan Train is a social experiment dealing with the care of orphans which replaces orphanages by spreading out the care of these children among families across the country. This system is often little more than indentured servitude and has little to no oversight. Kline makes this history come alive through charismatic characters and a story so engrossing that I sobbed at certain events and cheered at others.  I could not put it down.<br />  Orphan Train is beautifully written , full of unforgettable characters, thought provoking , and recommended for everyone.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book is too focused on details of one after another sexual encounters. I was hoping for several plots within plots with unexpected twists and turns.... it was unusual but left me wanting MORE...
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Everyone should read this book! Learning how to cope with the disabilities of others is not easy. We need to show more empathy and this is an excellent way to start.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was a good violent book but the end got confusing,over all I think I was a pretty good book
B004EPYZU8|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I was confused and wasn't sure exactly what the storyline was. After seeing it a second time I was hooked. This is an excellent movie. The dance scenes are fabulous. The storyline is excellent. The action is awesome. I watch it again and again and each time it's better than the last.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Easy assembly, lightweight, easy to move around the house or up/down stairs.  Bright colors are fun for keeping baby's attention and lots of little wheels to spin, rainforest sounds, and hanging toys.  The seat is washable (I don't dry it though) and it spins all the way around so baby has variety of little play areas.

B00COH0W00|4.0|If you like upbeat romantic comedies set in New York City, you may want to sample this film.  It circles around the idea of serendipity, those chance meetings that are meant to be as if orchestrated by a benevolent fate.  Sara and Jonathan meet at Bloomindales over a pair of gloves and decide to share an iced hot chocolate at the famous SERENDIPITY chocolate eaterie in New York.  Both are involved with others, but they feel an attraction.  To test if fate wants them to be together, they set up a an experiment involving a $5 bill and a novel. How this all shakes out is why you watch the film.  Although the events which follow may strain credulity, if you are in for a little fantasy in a romantic plot, you will enjoy this.  Just be prepared that you will want to go to SERENDIPITY yourself some day.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|I love this app! Finally a notebook you can decorate the way you want. I have also downloaded many of the extra (respacks) with more covers and symbols. I loved them as well. The two things I would like to see in the future is to be able to use your own pictures as covers on the notebooks. Even though I paid for the extra covers I'd still like to see more options. The second thing I'd like to see is for there to be a bookshelf background to put the notebooks on, different themed bookshelves would be nice. Another bonus is you can add your own pictures to your notebooks not as just a attachment. Thanks a lot!

B005LAIIMG|5.0|The unrated (as opposed to the theatrical) cut is only eight minutes longer,  mostly very short bits elaborating on the zombie attacks. So the  unrated version makes the violence much more vivid. The cuts were probably  made to spare the gentler souls among us, but if you're into zombie apocalypse  you may want the critical-mass view of things. There are also longer versions  of the plane flight out of Jerusalem when things get rowdy and the epilogue  scenes such as the battle of Moscow. In particular, the big Philadelphia  sequence at the beginning is notably more intense. On the other hand, if you're  watching the theatrical release, you won't be missing plot points or anything  like that.  Of the film itself, it definitely doesn't screen like something that was rumored  to be weak before its release, as this was. In fact, it is both innovative in this  genre and very exciting. It's also a lavish production for a genre film, and a  very fast-moving and intricately developed narrative that has to be seen at least   twice before it makes all of its points. Over the years, I think it's going to  develop into quite a classic.

B00280LYIC|5.0|I think I should read the rest of the series. I only read this book because my friend Even Davis told me he read the series like 3 times and the movies were a disappointment, to the book. So I think this book was great I loved it. Totally worth the $10 I paid on my kindle fire.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I like this only if you are doing short videos. The  item overheats and then the quality suffers because the stream slows down and even stops. I will keep it for now.

B002WY65W4|5.0|A lot more humor than expected.  The characters are great.  Liked it so much the first time we rented it that I had to buy it.  Will be a classic for many years if you like Woody Harrelson and apocalypse scenarios.  My wife was hesitant to watch it at first, thought it would be stupid.  She ended up liking it as much as I did (or at least close).

0345537998|4.0|As a fan of George RR Martin's Game of Thrones series, I decided to pick up one of his other well known books. After reading it, I decided it was pretty good. By no means is it as entertaining or outright brilliant as his Songs of Fire and Ice series, which kept me up hours in the night eager to flip from page to page, but the strong and amusing writing is there. The characters are quirky and dynamic and the scope of the universe in which this book takes place is quite large. Overall a good and worthwhile read

B003H4I4JU|5.0|This is not the action-packed, introspective, child-defying-the-system epic that is \\"Ender's Game\\". This is a very mature piece.

And you should at least give it a try because, quite frankly, this is even better than \\"Ender's Game\\".<br /><br />See more at [...]
1401941893|3.0|I have read previous self-help books, so I had common knowledge about the Law of Attraction, the Universe, all the basics of spiritual self-help books. So for me, this book was sweet, but indeed \\"light\\" as other reviewers are saying. It was fairly basic and didn't \\"wow\\" me. However, I highly recommend this book for women who have never read any self-help before, especially young girls (teens to early 20s).<br /><br />Overall I say, if you have never read self-help, its a fantastic starter book, and great for those with mild self-esteem issues. However if you have read self-help or may possibly have more complex confidence issues, this book may not have anything new or surprising for you.

B000PAAH3K|5.0|I read reviews, disappointed that there was no unifying theory being proposed, wanting a technique for knowing when to trust our own snap judgements, expecting a book more like The Tipping Point. Jeez guys, miss the point much? This is an important book, not to be missed. I know I'm late to this party, but they asked for a review and this is it. Buy this, read it, understand it. It's worth it.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I have been a fan of Bond since the first one I saw, that one being Octopussy, and come to find out that one has gone down as one of the most cheesy Bond’s around.  This version of Bond has been really good and the three that Daniel Craig has been in have exceeded my expectations by a good bit.  If you haven’t seen the other two before this one they are worth a checking out.  This is the last of 3 of the origin story and I think they wrapped it up pretty well, telling you more about his past than we have found out before, making James a lot more human than the super human in some of the others.  It is still missing a lot of gadgets that I love so much about a Bond movie, but they did replace a lot of gadgets with character development so I won’t fault them for that.  I am looking forward to see what they do next.
B00EJU8ZIG|2.0|For 16, Lorde has potential. I can see that in her.<br />She wants to do something different, I can feel it.<br /><br />But this is not that yet.<br />All of her lyrics are vastly uninspired and hollow, where she makes overt dialogue about adult matters that a teen of her SES wouldn't normally claim. I find it hard to follow any of her lyrical structures or commentary on childhood and maturing. Her voice is already magnetic. I think it's great. Yet, her lyrics are as obnoxiously porous as Lana del Rey.<br /><br />Musically, there is room to create something magical here.<br />I feel her next release will be more interesting because honestly, these songs are incredible boring and it's nearly impossible to distinguish any of them from each other because of the repetitious beat(s) that melds into each track.<br /><br />And then there's the lack of sound, the void she creates in between the music and the words.<br />It just doesn't work here. It seems forced. Bands like Sigur Ros, Bon Iver and Caspian are able to create voids like this and they work. Here, it's just anxious.<br /><br />I'm not completely disappointed in the album, I just expected a lot more from someone who has been touted as the next big thing in music.
159463176X|5.0|I am a fan of dr. Hosseini's and this book is another example of how fine a writer he is. It is not as fast a read as the Kite Runner but his characters are as endearing and disappointing as is life in the Middle East. I highly recommend it.

B00A81MV3U|5.0|Recently, my husband rented \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" from our apartment rental office.  This was a kind and loving gesture because he remembered that I had wanted to see the film when it was released in theaters. \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is a touching film of a character around Pat Solitano, whose life is turned upside down after he undergoes treatment for an episode that triggered him reacting with extreme aggression. Pat's parents take him in and he unexpectedly meets and falls in love with a woman named Tiffany.  He does his best to avoid showing it because he is trying to reconcile with his wife Nikki. \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is a moving drama film that is good for those who are familiar with any movies featuring Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and/or Robert De Niro and/or those who movies with comedy, drama, and/or romance.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|Not watching much tv, I saw the short promo for this show the same week it premiered in 2010.  When they showed McGarrett say \\"Book 'em Danno\\", I thought, 'oh jeez, I can't believe they're coming up with some pretty boy jerks just so they can pose and say that line'.  I gleefully tuned in that Monday ready to laugh the show out of the water.  Five minutes later I was saying 'Whoa, now that's an opening!' and I was hooked.  Glad to say I was wrong about it all.  The lead is perfect, very convincing as a navy seal.  Caan strikes a perfect balance, Kim is super-cool and Park is an interesting take.  I never miss it.
B002EDH0FE|2.0|The graphic novel is an original, ground-breaking, masterful classic. The movie is sub-par on its own merits, but, as an adaptation, it took the original source material and reduced it to elementary meaninglessness inside a deviant action flick.

B009SJ46EA|2.0|What made the 2nd season of AHS difficult for me to enjoy was the unfocused plot, particularly the disappointing season ending. An asylum is a great setting for the show. It's a dark, scary place with a sense of \\"there's nowhere to run\\". And then the story could explore the various lunatics within.<br /><br />Instead, the show's writers decided to throw any and every horror story plot device into the mix. The result becomes a plot that made little sense and had no real focus. In season 1, it focused on the family and their issues, and then delved into the stories of the former tenants which inevitably got wrapped up in the main plot line. In Season 2, they should have kept that same paradigm, and used a main story line (like the serial killer, Bloody Face), and every now and then explored the back stories of the other inmates which would eventually get tied back to the main plot. Instead, they have multiple plot lines going at the same time which often don't even have anything to do with one another. One episode will be about a serial killer, the next... about alien abductions, the next... about a demon possessing one of the nuns, the next... about a nazi scientist experimenting with zombies. There's too much going on and no meaningful connection between any of it. I don't even know which character I'm supposed to care about. Typically, when stories have multiple plot lines, they will cleverly tie them all together before the end. Well, when the end of this season came, nothing really came together. At the end, I didn't have any character that I particularly liked (or hated), sympathized with, or even thought about after the show.<br /><br />Hopefully season 3 can stick to a single 'Witch Coven' story line and not try to force in frankenstein's wretch, werewolves, crab people, or whatever else they can find from the horror genre.

I do want to get back to it because I feel like I'm committed.... but I really, really, really, need to know if Anna has some type of steel vagina. Who can have sex that much? It's got to be hard to write sex as new and exciting when it's the same couple over and over again. I understand that. The first book I turned pages for the sex, this next book I turn the pages to see what this couple could possibly do in the long run and it's more out of curisoty than concern for the characters.
B00FRG58TK|3.0|The show is great, however, Amazon's delivery is leaving something to be desired.  The show was online for free yesterday, and didn't show up in my Amazon library until today 48 hours after broadcast.  They do this again, I'll cancel the season.  Why pay for something I can get for free?  This has been a problem in the past with Amazon's videos which is why I wrote it up as a rating.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|I have always been open to such ideas, and deep down inside, want to believe.  However I am also very science-minded and realistic, so I often find myself back and forth trying to figure out what I believe.  Although this book was a bit slow to read, the message was reassuring.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|If you're OK with JRPG-style combat, this is a fun and engrossing RPG that will definitely serve to while away the hours in an airport or wherever you tend to play mobile games.<br />But it's NOT a casual game, really: after putting it down for a few months, I found I have completely forgotten the plot, and find it hard to get going again with it. So, possibly not ideal if you don't plan to be playing it regularly.<br />But it's a fun retro game, with atmosphere, plot and characters on a part with some of the old RPG classics.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I fell of the King wagon some time ago (around the Tommyknockers), but came back for some recent books including Under the Dome (loved it).  This book was a great read.  I was waiting for 'the twist' and for 'the clichéd dumb move' but I was pleasantly surprised.  Everything made complete sense within the context of the story.  I can't recommend this more.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Miyazaki goes from strength to strength. This one is possibly his darkest: a girl's surreal trip into the spirit world; a coming-of-age story with a tone akin to Pan's Labyrinth.<br /><br />Miyazaki's deep, complex, meaningful animé like this are why I simply cannot watch the vapid animé series that are pushed in the US: there is just no comparison between them.
B00EQ30RVY|5.0|The DeLeo's and Eric Kretz have always been a great band and I love everything that was STP with Scott Weiland. Unfortunately STP never became as big as they should have been and haven't made as much music as they should have due to Weiland's issues. Even worse Scott Weiland's voice has deteriorated to the point that he can't sing the bands songs well enough to do them justice.<br /><br />Bennington can and he's as big a fan of the band as anyone. These 5 tracks are more of the same hook filled catchy riffs the band built their fan base with. They feel fresher than the last album though. The guys are in happier place and the music reflects that.<br /><br />High Rise is a great EP and has me wanting for more. Forget Weiland, if you love STP you'll love the new music.

B0023SDPS6|4.0|This is the first of the Longmire series that I've read.  I had a very difficult time initially separating the very different sotry line that the tv series takes versus the story line in the book.  If you are expecting the same exact set of characters and story line as what you've seen in the television series, you may be disappointed.  Once I was able to separate that issue and just read the book as something completely separate from initial percepation based on the tv show, I really did start to enjoy it and ended up liking the book quite a bit.  Mr. Johnson's writing is both thoughtful and clever.  People have compared his writing style to Robert Parker's, which I think is true in terms of some of the cleverness, but Walt Longmire is much more self deprecating and has much less of an ego than say, a Spencer character in a Parker novel.  Bottom line is that I really ended up enjoying the book.  It is a fast read and I've already downloaded and started the second book inthe series.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Though readers of the book will miss the many wonderful subplots, the movie is still delights and saddens in all the right ways. This anniversary edition is worth the investment for any movie collection.  I'm not a big blue-ray fan because I don't think they are worth the extra cost for all the hype.  For those who don't agree, we are all entitled to our opinions.  This version works for me.<br /><br />Gregory Peck embodies Atticus Finch and the bonus features reveal such tidbits as his meeting of Harper Lee during filming of the movie began a lifetime relationship between her and the Peck family.  Haper Lee was a notorious recluse, so this was quite an interesting bit of news.<br />The 50th Anniversary edition includes 2 discs, one for the movie and one for the Bonus Features.  The worst of the features is &#34;The Excerpt From The Academy Tribute To Gregory Peck&#34;.  There's nothing new here.  It's appears to occur after Mr. Peck's death and when Harper Lee is introduced, the camera is blocked by people's heads.  Terrible!  Plus, all you want to do the entire time Cecelia Peck is talking is brush her hair out of her face!  So annoying!<br />The best features are:  &#34;A Conversation With Gregory Peck&#34; and &#34;Scout Remembers&#34;.  These offer fun insights into filming and how cast members were selected.  Plus it's fun to see Scout all grown up!<br />&#34;The American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award&#34; is only Gregory Peck's Acceptance Speech, not the entire program.  Although his speech is quite insightful as to the man, given what he chooses to talk about.<br />&#34;Fearful Symmetry&#34; is a good look at the overall making of the film and repeats a bit of what occurs in &#34;A Conversation With Gregory Peck&#34; and &#34;Scout Remembers&#34;.<br />&#34;100 Years of Universal: Restoring the Classics&#34; is not specific to &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird.&#34;  It's interesting in its own right regarding the general loss of film and importance of restoration.  For those of us who love older movies, we can appreciate that the importance of restoration was discovered before more of the history of film was lost.restoration.

B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I've read the novel a few times and I really liked this movie even though I'm usually skeptical of remakes. I never saw the Redford version so I'm comparing it against the book but usually treat movies irrespective of the original print version. I think traditionalists will pick it apart but it has something to do with the age of the reviewer or how they pictured things in their mind. Acting, cinematography, and music were all very pleasing and added to the overall sentiment of the different scenes throughout the movie. It made you want to ask `what if' about the characters just like the book. It's an enjoyable film!

1612680011|1.0|I suppose Robert Kiyosaki makes money selling expensive seminar and board game on cash flow management.  If you search on the internet, it seems a lot of the stories in his books are lies.  There were no Rich Dad--the supposed successful dad of a friend that helped him get started.  Read it with that in mind.  Don't know if his story of living in a friend's basement while unemployed and developing a \\"system\\" was true or not.  If it is true, I think he already demonstrated that people following his path might wind up broke and homeless before they are successful.  He just happened to be lucky he wasn't on the street.  Some things can only be done in certain areas.  Investing in Tax Lien Certificates is an example of what can be done only in certain geographical area--returns will vary sharply, and if you want to protect yourself, it is highly recommended you visit the property in person--that limits your ability to do this if it isn't available within reasonable driving distance.  Gas isn't cheap and airfare and hotels aren't that cheap either.  I doubt he factored all costs of doing the research into his supposed 17% _minimum_ return on Tax Lien Certificates with safety.  If it were that easy, he wouldn't be writing these books--he'll just be leveraging all these deals and keeping his methods to himself and he'll be a lot more successful.  Ask yourself why would he give you this information in a book to let everyone compete with him?<br /><br />Book lacks details on how to do anything.  It instead refers to other books.  Supposedly, it isn't a how to book but an inspirational book.
B007OUINLC|5.0|Though I've read some comments by other reviewers as to the historical accuracy of the screenplay, there is certainly a core of information about the life and times of Jung and Freud that makes this a very interesting and intellectual film.  Keira Knightley, Viggo Mortensen, and Michael Fassbender each portray highly intelligent, complex characters and they do it so convincingly.<br /><br />Keira plays a tormented young woman who first visits the clinic to receive treatments for her bizarre behavior caused by an abusive father and neglectful mother. Her tics and mannerisms are so severe and disturbing that it is, at times, difficult to watch. Jung allows her to assist him in some of his therapy experiments, and this activity, and her burgeoning interest in psychotherapy, allows her to find her way back to relative normalcy. Along the way, she and Jung have an affair, which is the \\"dangerous\\" part of the method. She is quite addicted to Jung, though he eventually breaks it off and severs contact with her for a while.<br /><br />The long conversations between Jung and Freud about methods and approaches are quite interesting, and most are set in Freud's office, which is filled with books and objets d'art. A rift develops between the two doctors over time as they disagree more and more on the developing therapies.<br /><br />The sets and costumes in the film are sumptuous, and the glimpse into the history of psychotherapy is quite interesting. It is a cerebral film with some sex and intrigue, not a film for the masses but definitely entertaining, well acted and well directed.

B001TH16DS|4.0|MAYBE NITPICKING, BUT....<br /><br />I am delighted by this product in all ways but one:<br /><br />The inclusion of the original effects (models, matte paintings, rotoscopes, etc.) in all their \\"imperfect\\" glory, are what convinced me to buy this Blu-Ray, instead of just watching it all for free on Netflix.<br /><br />BUT...!<br /><br />The \\"toggle\\" icon (signaling each moment when an effect has been altered) is very distracting.  Whether you like the new or old effects, the makers of the show tried their best to integrate effects shots into the dramatic flow, and not to call attention to them as something separate.  The icon takes up a fair portion of the screen, and often lasts for the majority of the shot.<br /><br />So, does anyone know if it's possible to turn this feature off, and just watch the episodes?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  And again, sorry to nitpick.

B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Anker has produced a high quality charger for the cigarette outlet on your car.  This is very well made and so much better than similar, but inferior, devices that I have purchased from eBay marketers.  I use an Android HTC EVO V 4G, it uses so much battery power that I purchased an oversized extra-capacity battery to try to make it through each day's use.  When I am in my car, I try to recharge to extend the battery life.  I found that all of the devices from eBay sellers could not keep up with the demand of the HTC.  A new search for a better car charger yielded this Anker device at a great Amazon price.<br /><br />So far, the Anker was done what I need it to.  I like it even better knowing that it has a long warranty as a just-in-case.  Knowing that this is so well made, I have looked at other Anker products at Amazon for future consideration.

All in all, Good job, Mr. King!

B00BQ1S0OU|4.0|I will begin by saying, I made the mistake of seeing the movie before I read the book. It took me a while before I  stopped looking for the similarities and just enjoyed the story. It wasn't as over the top as the movie, or I don't believe the same humor. But it had a simple Jane Austen feeling, of just reading about the thoughts and life of this young woman and her awakening of empowerment of own self worth.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I don't know why everyone has a low opinion, I really enjoyed it! I don't watch movies to learn anything, I watch to be entertained. It was entertaining!

I'm glad I rented the movie, but I bet it was good in the theaters as well. Lighten up people! Good Show!!

B005ERIRZE|5.0|This was a fascinating book. It was brimming with psychology experiments that were both interesting and very revealing. For instance, did you know that if someone offers you a hundred dollars later, or fifty dollars now, you'll be more likely to wait for the future reward then if they offer you fifty dollars now, or a hundred dollars later? You're likely to choose the first option offered to you. Or did you know that a person is more likely to splurge on unhealthy food if they're asked how much progress they've made towards their weight loss goal then if you ask them how committed they are to their goal?<br /><br />I think my favorite experiment discussed in this book is the white bear experiment. The essence of the study is that as soon as you tell people to not think about white bears, that's exactly what they'll think about. It was a fascinating study on the effects denial has on your brain and your willpower.<br /><br />Smokers who acknowledge their cravings and acknowledge the associated feelings are more successful at quitting than those who try to ignore them. People who deny themselves certain food are more likely to think about the food constantly and ultimately binge on that food, resulting in a fascinating statistic that in the long-term, people who diet end up heavier than those who don't.<br /><br />However, there were a few contradictions that I think detracted from the book. At one point, the author suggested turning your \\"I will\\" power challenge into an \\"I won't\\" power challenge, at another point she suggests doing the opposite. At one point she talks about how if you exhibit superb self-control, you should work on giving in to your willpower occasionally. And while I understand that different people may need different \\"treatment\\" methods, I don't think the difference was explained as clearly as it could have been, other than \\"If this doesn't work, try this.\\" I also think there were a few places where the author did a better job of explaining human psychology then actually suggesting a fix for the behavior, such as where she said that the more you think about future you as a different person than current you, the less you will prepare for your future.<br /><br />While the book wasn't perfect, it was an engaging and informative read with practical techniques the reader can employ. I recommend it.sychology then actually suggesting a fix for the behavior, such as where she said that the more you think about future you as a different person than current you, the less you will prepare for your future.<br /><br />While the book wasn't perfect, it was an engaging and informative read with practical techniques the reader can employ.

B00EO2I6XS|1.0|No genre of films has so consistently misrepresented famous women, but this one sinks to new lows. The director has utterly failed to capture anything of the uniqueness of Hannah Arendt as a philosopher,mor her complexity as someone who courted Heidegger, and so had her own ghost in the closet, yet had the courage to argue the unspeakable truth, that Eichmann was bot a monster or psychopath, but an utterly ordinary burocrat. The truth of that statement still has to sink in. But anyway, the dialogue in the movie is too stereotypical and you will not gain any new insights into the woman,mor the philosopher. In my opinion.

As a teen my bedroom was covered with her posters, and I owned about five copies of True Blue, as my Mom broke the record everytime I got in trouble!

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Being a Rush fan, I always looked forward to their releases, until this one.  I heard the single \\"Caravan\\" and it just never really grew on me.  This led to me placing a purchase of the album on the back burner.  About a year after release, I finally picked up a copy for myself and gave it a listen.<br />  It would take a lot for the band to top their previous release, Snakes and Arrows, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the band was more than up to the challenge.<br />  Clockwork Angels is an album that has managed to become my favorite Rush album.  Not 2112, not A Farewell to Kings (though both still rank extremely high for me), Clockwork Angels.  This is an album that finds a band that, at one time, many considered finished that is managing to hit new creative highs not heard since Moving Pictures.<br />  The album runs from hard rock, to beautiful balladry, to catchy pop rock (as pop as Rush gets, I suppose).  The album also feels like a \\"welcome back\\" party for Alex Lifeson, who gets to really come to the forefront after a couple of albums playing an essential support role.  Geddy sounds like he's having a blast with the lyrics, and lays down some of the sweetest bass lines of his career, and Neil, well, Neil continues to be amazing behind the kit.<br />  I highly recommend this album to fans of prog-era Rush, and of concept albums.  This is a band that has tapped an inspirational well, and pumped every bit into every note they play on this record.  Not every song is amazing, but there aren't any skip worthy tunes.  Besides, how often do you hear about a 45 year old band putting out an album that easily ranks with their classics?
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love this series. Right now I'm on book 3 and I can't stop. Can't wait to read what happens next. I've read the first three before but I wanted to refresh my memory before I went and saw the movie.
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|After seeing all the horrible reviews and feedback this movie received, I was hesitant to buy it. But, I really like Will Smith, and his sci-fi movies are always solid, so I took a chance. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I think this movie catches a lot of fallout from the director. I didn't even know it was directed by M. Night Shyamalan until the end credits rolled. I am not his biggest fan by any means, but he has done his fair share of good movies and pretty bad movies. And The Last Airbender. As someone who didn't even follow the anime, that movie was still atrocious. So I think people see he is working on a movie and already form a negative opinion of that movie.<br /><br />If you watch the movie without expectations, it's a pretty good father/son bonding story in a sci-fi setting, with survival elements thrown in. It dragged a bit in two spots that probably could have been edited better, but it was otherwise enjoyable. The effects are good, and I liked the technology direction they chose, basing the ship and equipment on organic and paper-like substances.<br />Will Smith and his son share equal screen time, but most of the action scenes are Jaden's. The only thing that bugged me a bit was the weird accent they chose to use for the characters. The son ends up sounding like he is mentally challenged when the story makes it clear he is not, and the general mixes his future accent with modern vernacular.<br /><br />The rest of the plot seemed fine. You can nitpick anything to death, but if you look at modern society we tend to do a lot of things that make little to no sense, so we would we expect fictional characters and societies to act differently?

It's a collector's set<br />2. It contains a ton of extra hours of bonus content<br />3. Most people at least somewhat think the apron and coin are cool (the coin even has ties to coins they made to represent each season to give to the cast and crew of the show)<br />4.

B0088W6IMQ|5.0|This one well told, well directed, enterprisingly photographed, warmly acted and most exciting 5 season TV shows I've ever seen. I want it extended to 15 seasons with the same crew in front and behind the camera!!!

0316228583|4.0|Well written, many twist. Reflected human nature and all the complications life has. Was for mature readers, but could be read by well-read younger readers.
1846467640|5.0|I have a 3 1/2 year old girl and a 14 month old boy and they love the show Peppa Pig! They love this little collection of small board books. They sit and look at them several times a day my daughter enchanted with peppa and my son laughing at her little brother George. Great set! Worth ever penny!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|What a great device!  We are using it to try to cut the ties to Cable, as there never seems to be anything on despite the fact that we have 1000 channels!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Mindless, but fun interesting. Clearly designed to be appropriate for preteens. Needs daily interaction or no progress will be made.
1612680011|5.0|Was captivated in this book until I finished it! Since then, I have ordered two additional copies for my friends. Im happy with this purchase.
1603427244|4.0|A nice book to have on hand when you run into specific problems or unfamiliar techniques in a pattern. Small enough for the knitting bag with good illustrations.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I've been listening to John Schmidt and Steven Sharp Nelson since before they were famous, so this was an easy decision for me.
