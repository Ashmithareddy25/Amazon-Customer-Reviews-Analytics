B00190OHD6|4.0|This was a really good movie.  A little confusing when the husband looked so much like the other guy she meets in Ireland.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|There have been zombie movies, zombie shows, and zombie cartoons... Everything pales in comparison to the documentary-grade execution of The Walking Dead.  In a league of its own, the pilot-launching Season One has to be the best of all time!  Seriously, it redefines what a pilot can achieve!  Watch this alone, and you'll be hooked.<br /><br />The make-up is world class. The story & acting are riviting.  The soundtrack is haunting.  The cinematography is dark and compelling.  It adds up to a new benchmark in cable series quality.<br /><br />This is one of those productions that warrants BluRay...go the distance!  But not you Carl...Go back in the house!
1594203334|5.0|very interesting as expected. personal viewpoints with interesting background information. funny points too. overall a very interesting book, that could be translated in other languages.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Look, if you don't know what The Walking Dead is all about...well, you must have been in a coma during the Obama administration.  This is the best darn cable-series of all time!  Get it on BluRay, and get ready to camp out for a long time!  It's more adictive than peanut butter & chocolate.<br /><br />Get it, watch it, love it.
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|Perfect 4 buck movie for a heatwave day to hot to go out ! If you like Sci Fi Fantasy, you will love this.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|I had no idea that it's mostly christian programming. I wish it had been described with this information. I'm ditching it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|who doesn't LOVE Gideon Cross???? this series I could read over and over again, I am so excited that this series will have 2 more books, it is one of the more expensive books put out for your kindle, but really is worth it... keep up the GREAT work Sylvia, I can't wait for book #4 and #5
B004V9MU86|5.0|A beautiful collection of words, some so lovely I read them aloud.<br /><br />Nothing got done, no work, no play, no sleep until the Book Thief's final word.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This was fun but there are only 10 levels and I was able to beat the game in about 2 hours of total play.  I hope they will have more levels out soon!
1616550414|5.0|This book is simply fantastic it has all the information needed for a fan of The Legend of Zelda, i highly recommend it
B00D41H2PS|1.0|I had the same problem as some of the others.The ship drawer wouldn't open for me either on the kindle fire.
B008Y79IUE|5.0|This movie is about relationships, and how drugs can ruin lives.  Central characters are a widowed mother, her son, and his girlfriend.  The son becomes a drug dealer and tells his mother he is an &#34;import distributor&#34;, which she takes as any mother would...proudly telling her widow friends about her son's success.  His girlfriend is a fashion designer.  Both are recreational cocaine users.  The mother is not happy with her weight, and goes to a doctor to get some diet pills.  The son's drug dealer gets killed, so his &#34;job&#34; and source of income vanish (as well as his source of drugs).  He and his girlfriend then struggle to find enough to satisfy their cravings, and mom becomes addicted to the diet pills.  We watch as the lengths to which one will go reveal themselves and the final outcomes unfold.  An interesting story that shows how ruinous recreational (and even prescription) drug use can be.
B001HN6922|5.0|was for my nephew and he loves it  watches it almost daily  you are asking for to much info. excellent movie
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down and have reread many times. Great story for a mature reader. Been passing it on! C
B0063IH60K|3.0|Even the random games let you win too often.  This should be harder to win. I'd like a more challenging game as this gets boring.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|As usual Willis does great action movies, with some good one liners.  The story line was weak in my opinion.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is very well written and acted.  I love the character developments although I hated that two main characters had to die. Matthew should have been severely injured so he could come back. The characters are SO real that you really feel for them. I also love to watch how Carson deals with situations. It is so classy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much I just wish they would have put experience points and an enchanting table that would've been better.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I thought I was getting just a regular hidden objects game, but I thought wrong! The game is a little confusing at first, if you didn't know the game (like myself), but after playing it you get the hang of it. Some are very easy, whereas some are far more difficult. The game does pass the time rather quickly and before you know it you get a warning about low battery which kinda kills the fun! I fully recommended the game if you want to pass time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm big for puzzle games, so this really stimulated my need for being able to complete each level at its best score. It helped in my problem solving.
B00735HGQ6|5.0|Great story, well told. Gripped my interest all the way through to the satisfying, surprising end. Now I have to find out what else Rachel Joyce has written.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Usual Angy Birds affair with the introduction of space, gravity effects, blasters and lightsabers. The Space edition had a short shelf life for me and this Star Wars edition feels the same to me. I would pass on this if I was not a Star Wars fan. The Abracadabra AG Seasons has the better gameplay appeal with portals a more compelling draw for me than rehashed gravity fields from Space.
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|This is a fantastic movie, I've been waiting a long time for this one.  Thanks so much.  My hubby is a real John Wayne fan.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Daughter enjoyed it and it was for her. She wants all Robert Downey Jr. Has talent to play many Characters. And he did a great job with this one. I myself have became to watch more of his movies.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|I love this soundtrack. The score is just beautiful. Nominated for an Academy Award, and I'm really surprised it didn't win.
B008XNPO20|1.0|While spinning this for the first time today, I realized that side D of Tame Impala's Lonerism is not Lonerism but in fact side D to Kurt Vile's \\"Wakin on a Pretty Daze\\".<br /><br />This is an album released on a different label, from a different country, released at totally different times. What a crazy, interesting mistake.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 1 star is because I didn't get what I ordered, and would like to solicit a response and maybe a replacement copy of the second LP.<br /><br />Great album!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have been waiting forever to get this game on my Kindle fire. It is a fun, addicting game for all ages. You pretty much buy and upgrade vehicles on different terrains. Once you pick up this game, you won't be able to play one round and put it down. 5 STARS!!!!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I appreciated the fact that Dr. Alexander did not reaearch NDE's until he had thoroughly explored and recorded his own.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|These are memories worth sharing with the younger generations and maybe inspire at least some of them to be the ones to see us travel like what Star Trek® portrayed it would be.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|Interesting story...some scary and lots of funny and cute parts.  The owls are beautiful!  Their feathers flow like water in the wind.  Great for the whole family; however, may be too scary for little ones.
1416594795|5.0|I just completed this book and found it absolutely intriguing and fascinating.  Well written, I was engaged cover to cover.  In between reading, I was note taking and looking up references.  The book, its contents, the authors style and comprehensive, deep knowledge - was an \\"experience\\" and I am still breathless for the take.
B00D3V97DO|4.0|Every Sabbath fan is going to have their opinion, but this is an inspired record by 3/4 of the original band.  We reviewed it on our prog rock blog here:<br /><br />[...]
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Me Before You, is unquestionably, the best thing I have read in a very long time.  Lou's story is one I think many can relate to.  We live our lives, going through the motions each day.  We enjoy friends and family.  Go on a vacation here and there.  Maybe even engage in hobbies that we enjoy immensely.  But, are we living the lives we should be?I'm not so sure that I am.<br /><br />This relationship between Lou and Will is certainly a love story.  They become as connected as any two people can become.  But, while other stories of romance seem to rely heavily on the intimacy between the characters to tell their story, Me Before You, delves deep into the heart.  As a result the story is so much more meaningful.<br /><br />Everyone should have a love in their life like that of Will and Lou.  One that inspires you to live your fullest more brilliant life.
B005MXQD5Q|5.0|I first saw this on cable, though I was not able to see the whole thing.  So I ordered it from Amazon.  As I said it was a great introduction to Leonard Cohen.<br />I had never heard of him or his music before.  To say the least I was mesmorised.<br />I watched it once and then watched for a second time right away!<br />I then ordered the CD, I was that impressed by it.  It is fantastic, the music is well done, I have always liked music that has a lot of bass to it.  You are drawn into his music right from the beginning.<br />one night I needed to get away from things for a while, so I took out my DVD, it snapped much to my dismay!  I ordered another DVD right away.  And had to listen to the CD.  So not all was lost.<br />I'd like to see more of his concerts on DVD.<br />He is timeless.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Focuses in Kaleb and companion, little about changelings, forgotten, or human. Opens up possibilities for more novels. Very enjoyable...already read twice. Hope there are many more to come.
B00AATV046|5.0|Cary Grant has always been my favorite actor and the story is timeless.  I like the concept of an angel coming down to help we mortals.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|Well worth the wait. It explains the background well, is atmospheric and well directed. The wife and I loved it.
B003AJKPL2|3.0|The idea is great but often the pitter would drive through the cherry and leave the pit behind. I also think it's a bit messy.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I found this book disturbing. The characters were so ordinary...and evil. I think that's what is so disturbing - that these people could be your neighbor.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed reading Hunger Games. The story flows and is quite compelling. I love Katniss Everdeen's wit & stealth. I have completed this book and have moved to the 2nd is this series. The story line contains acts of violence. I purchased this book via my tablet.
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|I enjoyed the movie it was wonderful that it was a true life movie. I felt it was well done.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|It is what expected, works just fine, 3D on a Sony TV is just awesome, love it, should have bought this sooner
B0085M9L0U|4.0|the record is fine. The quality of the recording is not excellent. This may be due to the quality of the master used.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Fantastic movie, especially seeing it in 3D, loved watching it on my Sony 3D TV. The kids really loved it.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|This is a delightful tale of creative imagination and destiny. The cast is brilliant, the timing is brilliant, the story is thought provoking, it's laugh out loud funny, and simply one of the best comedies ever!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|all Bond movies are suppose to be a little over the top, but this one goes beyond imagination.... a motorcycle chancing a motor cycle over roof tops from building to building.... really? just way to unbelievable. but if you are in it for just the action you will like it.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I had no expectations, but after hearing a passing review on NPR and a mention on Gawker I knew it'd be worth my time. It was.
B00BF11UM0|4.0|Every American should see this film.  Out military is THE BEST!  God bless them all.  Thanks to all for making us safer in a very unsafe world.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Amazon readily replaced a defective item.  Problems with Kindle fire addressed conveniently and promptly.  Thank you for your support with my Kindle fire.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I enjoy Tina Fey and can almost hear her as I read this book.  It was interesting and funny.  I could definitely relate to a lot of the material (working mom, etc).  I found myself laughing out loud a few times.  I recommend it.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|A great story that is inspiring and reflective. It's an easy read that I didn't want to put down! I'd recommend it to anyone.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|Ok...don't get me wrong I really like the sealed deck thing but I would like a magic app with more customization I can create my own deck or use the decks I'm<br />currently playing with in campaign
B001QB5S3G|3.0|Sound track recordings may fit  screen action, but for listening pleasure, the selections were disappointingly  too brief.  Possibly some themes should have been developed, and others shortened or omitted.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It makes a change for regular patience, but getting too easy now. fills in time while I am waiting for something.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 23 month old son has become obsessed with this app. Finally bought the full version because he mastered the free version.
0674048849|5.0|This is a beautiful book!  I didn't expect it to be a &#34;coffee table&#34; show book, but it is.  The interesting illustrations are outstanding, but do not overpower the ongoing story.  The text is readable, and I particularly like that the footnotes numbers are subtle, with the actual notes located in the outside column, alongside the text, requiring just a glance as one is reading the text.  The only disadvantage is that it's for serious reading, rather than curling-up-with-a-good-book-reading, unless one has a generous lap!  So I'm in for some serious reading!<br /><br />I've other editions of my most favorite of Austen's books, but thought it would be interesting to add this annotated edition of &#34;Emma&#34; to my Austen library.  That leaves two more of her works to add to my collection, so perhaps I will consider annotated editions of them, if available!
B0009IW9DE|5.0|Liked the old stuff. Has god music not the meaningless rap junk you hear today.<br />This guy knows music. Love it
B002ZG99TA|1.0|Defect in audio commentary while movie plays - had this problem before with it when purchased from a local store here in town. We'll see what another dvd brings this time.
B000063V8T|5.0|This was a steal of a deal! Price was just great and the discs were 99.9% blemish-free. (the .1 didn't effect the play though - perfectly clear picture.) When I need more sets, I'll come back to this one!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and interesting game. Challenges you to think outside the box and use your logic and reasoning skills to solve the puzzles.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Thank you I love the product. Easy access and easy used I will recommended also I will installed this on my tablet too.
B004KA9UX4|5.0|This book is must for all students of jazz music. It is often quoted and referenced to. I own a hard copy which is huge so I was very excited to see a Kindle version and purchased it immediately. Now it is always with me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game actually surprised me.  :)  I love it.  It gets your brain thinking.  I think I found a new addiction to keep me entertained for hours!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Loved this season.  Loved the dragons.  Kinda gorey but that is what this show is about.  Acting is fabulous.  Settings are amazing
B0096DZKZC|4.0|not very good at playing theses type of games...but I'm giving it my all. fun and has you on your toes.
B009LMTDL0|2.0|i thought it was basic nothing new for most women who have successful careers.  until woman really work together we will always be behind.
B00BFBSV72|4.0|thought I would jump in with this sort of game, even though I'm not that good with this kind of game.  But practice makes perfect and well....all in all very fun.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game but few levels. Need more levels to get 5 stars. The levels they do have are challenging and fun. Great design and flow to this game. Not alot of ads so that's good too.
B0097EWK3A|2.0|Well just like all big fish games in order to continue with the game you have to pay! You get to a certain point and they want you to pay to finish the storyline and game on an otherwise FREE game. Aside from that loved everything else about it  but again had to delete from kindle device because I don't believe in paying for an advertised FREE game app seemed like a rip off or misleading the public.
0446554995|5.0|I have always loved the series of Agent A X E Penderghast. I wish they would make a movie featuring him. The one they made for Relic sucked and didn't really delve into the characters at all. This is a great book with a lot of ups  in the action. They surprise you at every corner
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Was confusing, not clear enough guidelines or instruction on what you are supposed to do in each room and its a slow moving kind of game
B005HED11Y|5.0|Thanks for making Star Trek Original available for us old Star Trek fans.  The quality is excellent.  Really appreciate it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is the best bingo game out there. I wake up and cant wait to play tournament and collect credits. Its a part of my morning routine its so fun!
B002DKGWSE|3.0|Not so great, should have followed the plot of the first movie closer. If your going to do a remake at least try to improve on the original.
B000WGZGNS|5.0|Michelle Williams did an outstanding job of commenting on Beyoncé as she performed.  Would like to see Beyoncé and Michelle Williams make an album and I would like to Beyoncé and Kelly Rolling make an album together.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is such a great game because of the amazing graphic and also can tell you what training and taking care of your horse is like. It is a great game, GO GET IT!
B00C5UV3YU|5.0|I loved the dvd especially the performance of Survivor.  Survivor is the greatest song that I have heard in a long time.  I can relate to the song because I am a &#34;Survivor&#34; myself.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I had fun watching Mama Mia! I love Meryl Streep and this movie was a blast to watch because ABBA was from my generation and their music is GREAT! Really a cute movie theme and great fun. I loved it!!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|But dam when are they going to get candy crush available for Kindle fire? Tired of waiting come on people get your s together. You have something here don't blow it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game it's a good challenge alot of places to go and alot of characters I highly recommend you get this game
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|You know, after dozens of films with the same name, same characters, same formula (\\"pretty\\" women, super spies, unreal chases and fights), it gets old. When Daniel Craig first came into the role he breathed a different kind of energy into it and I was briefly interested again... but that was short lived. Enough is enough is enough. Enough milking the same IP's, enough making sequels, and enough remakes. Lastly, enough James Bond; make something new for a change... or isn't anyone capable of this anymore.<br /><br />My eyes began to roll within the first five to ten minutes of this film; you are presented with a motorcycle chase that goes to rooftops and ends on a train - absurd. I like escapism and suspension of disbelief but that doesn't mean I want to watch a giant purple dinosaur or guys chasing one another via motorcycles on rooftops. Again, in this film like so many past, you have a once good guy, usually from intelligence, turned bad. Tired. Tired. Tired.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|This version is old as is not being updated.  Get it from google play. Will give better rating if the game version is kept current.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The honest and heartfelt story of Chris Kyle, SEAL and sniper, husband and father. It is an intimate look at a complicated man in his best and worst times in peace and at war. Knowing of his recent and tragic death made reading it a very moving experience for me.
159562015X|5.0|I like this book because it is a great tool for opening conversations with people. It is useful to get an idea of what your strengths are and use them to your advantage.
074401493X|5.0|This guide is nicely organized, comes with a Firefly collector's pendant and will guide you through 15 hours of exciting adventure. The edition is a hard covered, but not Smythe-sewn, which means it is glued and can still come apart if you treat it too roughly. The author's have included all the hidden secrets, the location of all of the pendants and some strategic pointers to aid you along your journey. If you are a completist, you will appreciate this guide. BUT, if you are anti-spoilers, you would be advised to complete the game first and then go back and, with the aid of the guide, play the game through a second time and find all of the hidden goodies.<br />Recommended.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Showed this to my high school students and they loved it! I highly recommend it. I Enjoyed it too! You will love it.
0307592731|5.0|Great book from beginning to end.  Cheryl portrayed her adventures with humor and perfect detail.  A must read for any avid outdoors person.
B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|I'm a HUGE fan of Kanye's ... hence, the three stars instead of two ... but I definitely was not a fan of this new album of seemingly conceptualized tracks.  I expected that he'd drop a lot of Black thought in his lyrics.  But the tracks were just garbage.  I wasn't feeling them at all.  I hope the next album is better.  I'd love to support.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|When I download the extra and When I push Ok when its done downloading it comes up as a blank black screen please fix it and I will give 4-5 stars
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Whoa, this animation was really good. It would have been better if the art based on FRANK MILLER's, but I enjoyed it.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|It makes you feel sympathy for their love. It shows true love. It shows all love isn't easy but it makes you feel some thing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a really funny game<br />the only inconvenient is the fact that you need lots of energy to compete and you need gems to make it faster
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is easy enough for a toddler to enjoy, but challenging enough for any of the inner logistical engineers to feel challenged. Everyone can enjoy it.
B0091ICDHU|4.0|Enchanting tale of young love and the challenges that life can throw your way. Growing up and getting used to adulthood is hard enough for most but this main character is dealt more than her share.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is awesome! there is lots of animals and baby animals. my bff got a pink baby sheep!buy it the money is worth it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Finally,a good game that is a great first game for your phone or tablet! When I first got my kindle fire I bought this game in a heartbeat. Would I recommend this .........you bet I would!!!!
1451624468|5.0|Excelent book, mr Krauss writes very clear and gives a hope on understanding a bit more off the universe. Let's hope logic continues to thrive
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. Not only can I read the word of God in many versions, I love that I can post straight to FB as well as find live feeds at my church.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Just with the Hulk alone this movie was awesome .but adding all the other heroes made it perfect...i can play the scene were the hulk uses loki as a fly swatter ..over and over again
B00CZF8B68|4.0|Once again Pharrell has given the world an awesome soundtrack to be enjoyed by the whole family. Well done- Pharrell!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Grew up with this series and enjoyed every show.  After not watching for almost 30 years, still exciting and great
B00A655N8I|5.0|I've now listened to this recording twice (three times for some portions), because I wanted to better understand why it hasn't gotten better reviews.  However, the mediocre and poor reviews surpass my understanding.  Here's my take on this recording:<br /><br />First, the performers.  Even if I agreed with the negative comments about Gergiev's conducting (which I don't), the performers have to count for something in an opera recording, and I can't think of a better cast than this - and I'm not just talking about today's group of singers.  I cannot think of a better Siegmund than Jonas Kaufmann - is there anything this man doesn't do brilliantly?  He's been compared to Vickers, which is a pretty big achievement, but in my opinion he's better.  While I always respected Vickers as an artist, he sang everything with a degree of angst.  Of course, there are certainly portions of the role that call for angst, but other portions call for a heroic voice that Kaufmann has in spades, whereas Vickers still had the angst.  Equally impressive is Ren&eacute; Pape as Wotan.  He is simply magnificent; 'nuff said.  And Mikhail Petrenko is a realistic Hunding - not the bellowing brute you hear most of the time, but a human who is understandably jealous of what's going on.  The female singers are no slouches either.  I've not heard Nina Stemme in many recordings, but she's very impressive and reminds me of one of my favorite Br&uuml;nnhildes, Regine Crespin on the Karajan recording - a huge voice but one that never loses its femininity - and she has a great lower range that I'm not sure either Crespin or my other favorite, Birgit Nilsson, had (I really do have to listen to their recording again one of these days).  Anja Kampe is a passionate and strong Sieglinde - her vibrato almost goes over the edge, but never does. And Ekaterina Gubanova as Fricka is, likewise, terrific.<br /><br />Which brings me to the conducting.  I listened carefully to see if I ever thought Gergiev's tempi were too slow; I literally experienced that in only one case, near the very end of the opera.  However, in all other cases, I thought his conducting was lush and expansive and romantic without ever losing an ounce of the drama.<br /><br />I don't always agree with professional music critics, but in this case I found it reassuring to see that no less than Anthony Tommasini of the New York Times agrees with me; he noted that some Wagnerites have said that the Ring is an epic symphony and that \\"I mean it as high praise when I say that the work comes across this way in...Gergiev's recording, with a superb cast and the Mariinsky Orchestra....  Mr. Gergiev conveys the depth, breadth and weightiness of this masterpiece.\\"<br /><br />As I said above, \\"nuff said.\\"e too slow; I literally experienced that in only one case, near the very end of the opera.

B00821OX98|4.0|If you enjoy science fiction shows do not miss this one It will keep you wanting to see the next episode and the next one after that. So don't miss this one, Hurry up and rent or buy you will not be disappointed.
B00B9LNJ9I|2.0|I had high hopes for this albumn, but it's a big disappointment.  Most of the songs are bland and forgetable.  Two are ruined by the inclusion of rap segments.  What was Dido thinking?
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat on this one.  Clay getting closer to Tara and Jax taking the time to be a good father and husband with all the SOA troubles in his pocket was great.
B006ZS81GG|4.0|Interesting lyrically as well... the whole 'alternate' persona aspect of Lana Del Rey is also interesting.  But well produced, rich full sound.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|This is a &#34;comfort flick&#34; for me. I watch it when I don't feel we'll, or on a rainy day...or anytime I need a lift.  Great chick flick.
B002I9Z8B2|4.0|Arguably the best of the original cast Trek movies! Quality on this blu ray was very nice. Deep blacks and good clear picture quality. Recommend watching Space Seed, the original Star Trek season one episode that introduces Khan, before you watch this follow up. You can watch it for free as a Amazon prime member on Amazon video on demand.<br />Would have enjoyed more extras on the disc.
B002M9WW30|3.0|Rocky 1, 2, 3 are not Blue Ray.  Well, each may have 5 min. of crystal clear Blue Ray, but 95% of these films are VHS transfers with all of the grainy annoying scenes.<br /><br />Rocky 4, a newer film, has about 20% HD, and the rest is grain, grain, grain.<br /><br />Rocky 5 is more HD -- and not Blue Ray -- but the grainy transfers remain.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa, the most recent release, should have been 100% Blue Ray but is maybe 75% HD and not Blue Ray.<br /><br />So, if you are expecting Blue Ray on this box set, forget it.<br /><br />I gave it 3 Stars because they (Rocky 1, 2, 3) are great films.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|It may lack any great standouts, but the songs are just easy, good listening. Rucker's smooth voice and moving story-telling are as good as ever.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Hollywood has no imagination anymore. Is it really necessary to have foul language as every other word for the movie. There is no imagination to a love scene anymore either. You might as well just call it what it is. SOFT PORN. I was looking forward to this movie but I had to shut it off after a few minutes. I couldn't believe how vulgar it was. Totally disappointed.
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|This CD didn't wow me, but is nice listening. All songs are pleasant listening, but I won't be memorizing any lyrics on this one.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is cool, but the thing is is that I wish u could get gems easier and that things were cheaper. the graphics are great and so is the style of the horse. I highly recommend this game for horse lovers and for little kids.
193700788X|3.0|My first response was that the author obviously knows her characters best and must have been right to end her series by pairing Sookie with Sam. However, after I reflected for awhile, I decided that if Harris had wanted to go out with a bang, she could have had Eric kick Freyda to the curb and \\"turn\\" Sookie so that she'd be young forever. Readers probably would have preferred this or another lively ending.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|With the exception of the season finale which broke my heart (I won't spoil it), the acting in this series is amazing!  I can't wait for season 4!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Since most car rides are 30 minutes or more, this one helps pass the time with ease. A classic game.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Very different from the Nintendo DS version.  According to my kids,  &#34;It gives you more options than the DS version.&#34;  They like the Scribblenauts Remix better than the DS version.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|This one kept the 9-yr-old interested for a few hours, but got old. Curling only fluffed, cuts were imprecise. would have been nice to be able to go back one step at a time. Glad we had the free option to learn about the app.

I appreciate her creativity in her presentation of Holder and Sky's story, do not think it could have been written any other way.  I could not put the book down and shared it with my exchange student from Germany and same story, she read the book in a couple of days.<br /><br />Wow, can't wait for Finding Hope...

B00003CXA6|3.0|Having just returned from the spectacular re-enactment at Gettysburg for the 150th Anniversary of the battle, I decided to view again the 1993 film starring Martin Sheen as the  marble-on-monument version of General Lee.  I was as disappointed now as I was in 1993, and yearn for a retelling of this important tale.  It is especially interesting to look again at this work through the prism of Spielberg & Kushner's masterful \\"Lincoln\\", which shows how complex historical events can be rendered gripping, moving and uproariously funny (who can forget Tommy Lee Jones scene stealing performance as Pennsylvanian power broker Thaddeus Stevens).<br /><br />\\"Gettysburg\\" benefits from the contributions of thousands of re-enactors who gave tension and realism to the battle scenes.  But a film is not a re-enactment. It requires a script, and here the 1993 film groans under Ronald Maxwell's dutiful yet ponderous screenplay.<br /><br />Based on Michael Shaara's terrific novel \\"Killer Angels\\", the 1993 film version focuses principally on the interaction between General Lee and his skeptical lieutenant General James Longstreet on Seminary Ridge launching Pickett's charge, and the heroics of a tiny band of Mainers led by Joshua Chamberlain (a solid Jeff Daniels) on Little Round Top.  Most other elements of the battle are subordinated to these parallel stories and most historical characters remain absent (Union General Meade barely appears in the film).  Having decided on this structure, Maxwell should have rigorously adhered to it.  Instead, we are given distracting, rambling scenes with British Colonel Freemantle, debates on Darwin among Pickett and his colleagues, references to General Ewell's failure to take Culp's Hill but no depictions of the fighting at Culp's Hill.  Lengthy speeches interrupt the action while characters presciently describe what is about to unfold - poor Sam Elliot as Union Cavalry commander John Buford and Tom Berenger as Confederate General Longstreet are forced to use this theatric artifice.  Jeff Daniels and his Irish sergeant debate democracy, aristocracy and liberty.  The actors are required to step to center stage and deliver windy Shakespearean soliloquies but without the emotion or iambic pentameter. Consquently, the film drags for four long hours.<br /><br />Several performances stand out. Richard Jordan, who likely knew he was dying of a brain tumor and this would be his last film, is powerfully moving as one of Pickett's doomed brigadier generals.  Steven Lang, best known as the villainous colonel in \\"Avatar\\", gives energy and verve to the role of Pickett - his delight at receiving a critical role in the battle - his subsequent horror after the devastation of his division.  Jeff Daniels also breathes life into cumbersome dialogue among the men of the Maine regiment.<br /><br />Most disappointing are Sheen and Berenger as Lee and Longstreet, but upon rewatching the film and knowing the skills of both actors, I realized it was the playwright and not the thespian who is to blame.  History must be made human to reveal the heroism.  The film has grandeur but little heart.<br /><br />Kudos to the production for historical accuracy at every level, though they may have fetishized the facts at the expense of dramatic pacing. Still, the battle scenes provide a genuine sense of combat.<br /><br />Finally, while true to the novel, the hagiography of the Southern commanders seems a little at odds with hard truths.  These men were trying to break the Union. They were attempting to preserve the institution of slavery.  Should we cheer them?<br /><br />Having just watched several thousand re-enactors march in sweltering heat over several days to present numerous scenes from the battle to a riveted audience (also sweltering in the grandstands) there is little doubt the battle retains its fascination for the American public. Normally, I do not favor remakes, but this story deserves a retelling - perhaps more from the Union perspective.  When one stands before the monument of the First Minnesota regiment knowing it lost 82% of its men in a critical but suicidal charge, one realizes the importance of this story in the American consciousness. I wonder what Spielberg and Kushner could do with this material.  They certainly wouldn't lack for thousands of volunteers to serve as extras - just visit the re-enactment. Twenty years after the first film, the men are still raring for a fight.
B00AOCLWF6|1.0|Poor dialog. I know, I know. It's about an alien invasion. Still, I had hoped for something more Star Trek than Farscape.

B00003CX9E|3.0|The quality of the Citizen Kane film is high, so lovers of the movie (and it's great, though I no longer consider anything like the greatest American movie -- it's nowhere near, for example, Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt in suspense building or a serious exploration of evil) will enjoy Disc 1.  But Disc 2 is mostly fluff, poorly made, not particularly inspired talking heads; so Welles looks good in contrast to the lame directors of the extra disc.<br /><br />Gavriel Reisner

B002VECM6S|5.0|It was a great movie and Sandra Bullock played an one of her best roles in this movie.  I highly recommend this movie.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|This book is one of my favorites.  I have reread it many times and I still enjoy it!  I love the adventure this book has and the fantasy/magic as well.  Something that makes this book stand alone among others is the independent nature the main character (Sophie) has.  Most stories have the main girl be a nobody without a man or boyfriend at her side.  Here, Sophie doesn't give two shakes about that.  She has spirit and takes control of her own fate despite her status.  This is an excellent book for young girls.

B00BJS7104|5.0|Just watch it. Incredible story, character development, acting, etc. One of the best films I have ever seen. Of course, this is a &#34;grown ups only&#34; movie, with strong language, violence (not overly graphic,in my opinion) and some nudity. However, I do feel that all of those were done tastefully and only served to advance the story.
B00CE0BJQ8|5.0|\\"All the Little Lights\\" by Passenger showcase  songs that are a clever blend of indie and folk rock.  There is also a special bonus disc with acoustic versions. The popular  \\"Let Her Go\\" symbolizes the impact that relationships can have on a person.  \\"Things That Stop You Dreaming\\", \\"Keep On Walking\\", and \\"Patient Love\\" are also among some of the multiple songs that contain strong vocals and are calming. \\"All The Little Lights\\" by Passenger is good for those who collect indie rock music.

B0097EWK3A|1.0|I have downloaded and deleted this app five times with no success. I will not open for play after entering player name. Worse yet I have contacted  technical support and developers won't even give me the curtiousy of any response or explanation of problem. I have many of their games that have played to perfection, however  this one is a severe disappointment as is the lack of response from support  staff. Until I hear an explanation  I cannot recommend this game or further purchases from this developer. If they look in the report files they will find me as karema51 in complaints. Maybe they will then respond and explain what the problem is and how to correct it.  Update: since writing my review I have uninstalled/reinstalled, run app repair, force stop etc. As of yet this game still refuses to open. This is even more frustrating as I have read the hundreds of reviews raving about the excellent quality and performance of this game. Please developers, help me solve this issue.

B007FXLZ9K|5.0|Clearly the writer, director, actors, and other artists involved with this dark-hued masterpiece have lived and breathed rarefied NYC air.  Each brushstroke evokes intense longing for more of the most life has to offer. The movie's unanswerable questions underscore life's misfires with oneself and others. For many, the world's undisputed capital city removes societal barriers -- without necessarily allowing room for a deep sense of freedom. Thankfully so much is left unsaid in this story. Viewers choose to ignore or fill-in gaping openings for interpretation. So far I've seen this film three times, and over years ahead I suspect I'll revisit it. Because of the intensity, I need considerable time to lapse between viewings. &#34;Shame&#34; stays with its fans.

B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|It was a bit confusing in the beginning however it was worth sticking with it. I am not sure about the music &#34;Cloud Atlas&#34; that was supposed to tie everything together. I think that would have been better explained. I really like the example of all time is now and everyone works together with the same group of souls to accomplish whatever mission is due for that life. I loved the end credits and saw who was who in the cast. I was surprised by the characters that was played by the cast.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I loved playing this game on the computer and it doesn't disappoint here either.Once you customize your controls and get used to them its really easy and fun to play. Playing with your friends is really easy and fun. My only complaint is that my friends can update on their IPods up to a week before I can. Overall a really fun change of pace from other games.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I have told many people about this book. I don't want to give away the plot but the perspective that this book is written from tears at your heart. To be placed in that situation against your will and to do make the best of what she did with her son for so long takes imagination and strength. The book ended a bit abruptly to me or maybe it is because I just wanted to know more about them.
B00BNWWUDY|2.0|BORING!! Strange story, poorly acted. Just put me to sleep. Do not waste your time and money. SNORE......<br />The popcorn was good.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I'll start by saying this is probably the best mouse at this price point. However, in a few respects, you do get what you pay for. The design is nothing special, and the thing feels very cheap. It is made of thin plastic than flexes where it really shouldn't. The weight cartridge is kind of chintzy too. Its just a foam disc you shove some non descript hunks of metal into. So far, none of this actually seems to make any real difference in the performance though. The ergonomics are great for both a large handed palm hold (my normal grip), and a finger tip claw hold, although it does seem to be designed with the former in mind. The software is no worse than most gaming mice, but there is still plenty of room for improvement. Why give sliders with lots of little tick marks along the length when that particular setting only allows one of three preset options? Also, a few options only display as sliders and offer no option for a numeric indicator. Acceleration is a bit wonky too no matter how much I tweak the settings.<br /><br />Still it gets 4 stars for gaming mice in general, keeping in kind that most 4.5 or 5 star mice cost twice as much.

B008G8SFGO|5.0|Let me start by saying I'm 45 and have been a KISS fan for over 30 yrs. I've listened to everything KISS have put out many times over so I feel qualified to rate KISS as much as any fan. Bottom line...this album rocks!!<br /><br />I have read \\"KISS behind the mask\\"(which is an excellent book) and gives a lot of info about each album they made up to Psycho Circus. Everytime KISS has went into an album with the intent of rocking hard they have put out one of their best. (IE: the first KISS, Creatures of the Night, Revenge, and now Monster). Thats not to say any of the others were bad, just that those rocking albums mentioned are clearly among their best.<br /><br />Getting better with age?... the book \\"KISS behind the mask\\" talks about how KISS were average musicians and songwriters starting out,(their live shows were the best!) having no formal education and just \\"winging it\\" and learning as they went. But as the years have gone by its obvious that KISS' instrumental talents as well as songwriting abilities have become very good. I'm not saying Paul or Tommy are on par with Eddie Van Halen talent wise, but all of the current KISS members are more than adequate to make great Rock N Roll. (BTW, Yngwie Malmsteen is one of the greatest guitarists of all time and how many albums has he sold?)<br /><br />Monster is a rocking album that is loud and in your face, which is how I like KISS the best. At their age after almost 40 yrs of making music to put out this kind of quality new music is something to appreciate. How many bands can you think of that are putting out fantastic new music even close to 40 yrs? (BTW, Aerosmith's new album SUCKS!)<br /><br />Getting better with age?...absolutely!! I truly hope KISS stay true to their hard rock roots and continue to put out quality rocking music like this.<br /><br />(BTW, I have to say, Ace was right, KISS are better when they choose to rock hard.)

B006LSZECO|4.0|So this plot twists and turns so many times that you'll get whiplash trying to keep up. That's the good news. The only piece of bad news is that I think it ends on a low note, on one of the less interesting twists along the way. It certainly does not resolve the story in a way that leaves the reader feeling satisfied...at least I am not. But it is an entertaining read for sure. Love Gillian Flynn's novels!
B002ZG99A4|5.0|I have always been a fan of Blu-ray/DVD combo. The movie comes with 3rd cd that is the digital copy one with the code. The art on the CD's are nice as well.

B00C6B8TB8|5.0|The 'Comic' cover art design is well done with this steelbook. It has a nice matte texture with the varieties of greens being a nice mix of lime and others. Only disappointing thing is that there is no inside cover art but the outside cover art makes up for it.

Notch please fix this because this is my favorite game of all time and I don't want to be the one to stop playing your game so please do this especially the wolves.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|If I could have given this 3 1/2 stars I would have.  I have always liked Khaled Hosseini's novels, but I found this one to be pretty depressing.  This was a compilation of short stories that were connected to one another by thin threads.  In the end it left me asking, &#34;Would it have killed Hosseini to put one happy ending in just one of his short stories?&#34;  Well written, but no silver linings here.  Some might say that Hosseini is just trying to keep it real, but I say he had to work really hard to keep it depressing.  It won't make it onto my &#34;keepers&#34; bookshelf like a couple of his past books.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was a really well written book. The characters were all pretty funny. Made me cry my eyes out at the end.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Although this movie ends with a &#34;good message&#34;, it took long to get there. The first 30 minutes are entertaining, and then you spend the next hour-hour and half watching the main charachter self destruct. Some people may enjoy it, but it wasn't for me.
193700788X|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because I think Ms Harris stayed true to Sookie and that's the most important thing. It's hard to review this without giving away the spoilers but really, when Sookie used the cluviel dor in the last book, you kinda knew what/who was important to her. I'm so glad I didn't listen to all the naysayer reviewers and read the book, because really, what kind off Sookie fan would I be if I just left the series so close to the finish line? I stopped watching the True Blood series in the second season so maybe that's why I liked the last book so much more than others reviewers. The show just strayed too far away from the books and I found it unsettling and confusing as hell when I'd read the next book to come out.<br />I thought Ms. Harris did a great job bringing back a lot of characters, almost a fond farewell. Kudos to her for staying true to her vision.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Good streaming show, but comes short of being great. Even with the absurdly unbelievable concept it is still a good show. Not good enough to wait each week for a new episode. I'm good waiting for the whole season to come to prime instant an watch for free.
B0061S073A|4.0|I have a Kindle Fire HD and I love this app. My 2 yr old daughter constantly want  to play with my Kindle and before having this app every now and then I'd find that she'd purchased random things here and there. This app helps keep that from happening. However, I only gave it 4 stars because there have been a few time  when she's been able to get out of the app and into my regular home screen.

B0015DROBO|4.0|Captivating from the first page.  Just when you thought you had it figured out the author threw in a change.  It will hold your attention from start to finish.

B0016Q2D5M|5.0|A good updating of a great story. Well done<br />Brendan Fraser surprisingly good, supporting actors good also.<br />Several violations of the laws of physics, but not unexpected in this kind of movie; didn't detract for me.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Great mix of history, drama and romance. It's easy to read more than once,and you will inevitably learn something new each time.
B000JLPMPS|3.0|I don't care if it won 20 awards, this movie is very good when viewed once, but does not play well multiple times, like Outlaw Josey Wales does. Big benefit in Unforgiven is that Sondra Locke is not in it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Everything about this story pulled me deeper into the lives of the AfghAN  PEOPLE. A powerful story that kept me wanting more.  His words are poetry and he paints with a vivid verbal pallet so intense that sometimes it is hard to read what the characters are experiencing.  Have a tissue box handy if you are an emotional reader.  I could not put this book down, nor did I want the story to end.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This product is perfect in every way!  I will buy more of this product due to the high quality and excellent service.  This is a must buy it is 1/3 the cost from any online or store  I am extremely pleased!!
0385737955|2.0|I hope I don't spoil anything relevant, just wanted to give a fair warning to readers who prefer the same aspects in books as me.<br /><br />So I thought the Maze Runner trilogy started off awesome. Completely mysterious setup which slowly gets uncovered over time, the characters are easy to follow, as they themselves have no recollection of any extensive backround. It even starts off with a casual love story, held simple and sutle, which I found much more satisfactory in comparison to the new \\"twilight\\" flare which seems to have arisen these past years. The overall plot, which is uncovered throughout books 2 and 3, is very intriguing. I was very much looking forward to the unravelling of the results of WICKEDs trials at the end of the trilogy, hoping that Thomas and the other gladers would somehow find out about the overall meaning of everything they went through, and finally be rewarded by a world-saving result- NONE of this, however, takes place as expected: Thomas' opinion takes a turn to the complete opposite, not wanting to find out anymore about his past and refusing to find out about the overall meaning of anything. Even the afore mentioned \\"sutle lovestory\\" is, in my opinion, crippled throughout books 2 and 3, turning into the twilight like love triangle and basically destroying one of my favorite characters in the books (Teresa...).<br />Overall, I was fairly disappointed by the second half and especially the end of the trilogy.<br />Also, I'd be very interested to know if anyone else felt the same.<br />Otherwise, have fun reading.
B001FASVLE|5.0|I heard that it was so popular on the radio and I gave it 5 stars because it wasa great one. I enjoyed it so much!

B009NPLIFE|4.0|Nothing too surprising in the end but it was all nicely wrapped up. :-)  the last few episodes seemed to drag it out a bit.
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|Surely every year there are many good films by many good directors and certainly not time or money enough to see them all. Some of these quickly fade into dusty history, their only merits premiere date, technical innovations, or the star of the moment.<br /><br />But although this movie went released and unwatched in 2012, and I saw several movies in between, my residual interest did not fade for 9 months. After all, this film premiered after a screening of The Shining, always in good taste. It has (as from Doubt) Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams, who isn't cloyingly pretty, but rather beautiful and substantive. Paul Thomas Anderson, who makes captivating films out of subjects as unsavory as Adam Sandler and pornography, directs!<br /><br />The trailer is beautiful as well, a thoughtful artwork that invites you to go on a journey into the human character by way of its lowest depths and the looming figure of spiritual transcendence ¡¡¡but that's not what the movie is about!!!<br /><br />You probably already know that the religion in the movie is Scientology, thinly-veiled. Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is analogous to Hubbard. Processing is akin to auditing, as is Jesse Plemons to Hubbard's son, Quentin. But rest assured that this is no criticism or parody of Scientology, the doctrines of religion being extra-scientific and almost immune to criticism. I had read two books on Scientology beforehand, Going Clear and Inside Scientology, out of curiosity and so as to be ready to point juicy tidbits, references and \\"inside jokes\\"; this dysfunctional organization is laced with morbid absurdities. On that note you will be sorely disappointed, because the use of Scientology is as an aspic that holds tried-and-true observations on certain human personalities.<br /><br />The film is an interesting case study of a subnormal character, Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix, whom I've never seen before), who abuses atypical recreational drugs, engages in normal sex actsat inappropriate times, is violent, physically and socially awkward, defiant of authority but at the same time, craves to be a kept man, receiving bed and board and family and sexual interest from Lancaster Dodd and his kind after he breaks his ties with everything. If Quell is a loose gelatin, one that can't hold its shape and is already beginning to shear from the stress of existence, then Dodd is the firm mold that will hold, protect and encumber so long as he's in it.<br /><br />This is where the title is so appropriate. At one point, Dodd, the Master, refers to him as a bad dog after he assaults a skeptic of the Cause (a magnificent performance by Scientology) they encounter at a Processing party (like a Tupperware party, with Scientology!) But like any master, *the* Master exploits Quell's violent temper and desire for structure to use him as both an attack dog, a Revolutionary Guard of sorts, and a guinea pig for his ever-changing ideas on salvation and the methods of acquiring it. He knows this and is not afraid to use it, coaxing out of Quell confessions of incest, special cocktails of drugs, and tasks and exercises bordering on the abusive. Dodd requires an absolute devotion to him and the young religion, or else total separation. There can be no questions, no separate thoughts. Dodd, as was Hubbard or Bush, a leader you were either with or against. And by the time you're done watching the film, you'll wonder whether or not Quell could benefit from this organization, or whether or not all organizations are perhaps sprinkled with a few chocolate chips of bull****.<br /><br />Also: underutilized Amy Adams; beautiful, operatic music; amazing period work replete with first-generation American accents; many deleted scenes; the savory, rewatchable trailer, and cinematography to die for. I saw the film The Croods, which in one scene found the characters splashing around in some very realistic, computer-animated water, or so I thought until I saw the birds-eye view in this film over the back of the ship. That is water.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|You can see how the divine works. There are many miracles in this book and the life and work of Dr. Alexander. First his life's work of science creating a true sceptic. Then his rare illness and how that illness allowed a new template of possibility to those in the sciences to see consciousness in a new way. Then the description of &#34;heaven&#34; itself. With my sisters recent passing it is delivering much solace. This book delivers the possibility of connection and love that is available for all of us. It is a miracle of credibility validating the next phase of human evolution... Away from separateness and into the remembering of our divinity, light and love. ~ Jennifer McLean, Host of Healing With The Master

B00CO8TA4I|4.0|I bought the new Haswell i5-4570 so that I can play the latest games at either high or medium settings @ 1920x1080 resolution. Runs CS:GO and BF3 like a champ (200fps and 102 fps respectively).<br /><br />However, I ran into couple problem (really one, the other one is more of an annoyance) down the road.<br /><br />After a week, I noticed that the game was stuttering for a bit. My fps in CS:GO would start out from 200 fps and go down to 20 fps at times. I decided to investigate and found out that the CPU was idling around 80C and 100C under load through BIOS (MSI H87M-G43 REV 1.2) I thought the BIOS temp reader was off and used CPU Temp reader which said the same thing. I found this really strange as ambient temperature was around 20C (Hey I like to live cold - its also good for the computer :] ). Took a closer look and found out that the CPU fan was not running. It seemed like it was caught on a cpu fan wire but the actual problem was the CPU fan was not able to rotate at all. I always do CPU fan test before doing stress test so this caught me off guard. Replaced stock cooler with Cooler Master Hyper 101i and the problem went away.<br /><br />*On a side note, I really really really (can't emphasize this enough) dislike the intel's method of securing the CPU. Mine was really hard to secure (had to at put serious force onto the lever) and left a small indent on the sides. The cpu fan secure system on the sockets LGA 1156, 1155, and 1150 isn't the greatest either as I found the rotating mechanism really irritating when you have to work with small space.<br /><br />Otherwise, really happy with Intel's new Haswell.<br /><br />**On a second note, I read somewhere on Tomshardware about the design of the Haswell and its likelihood to run little hotter than her sisters' cores (Ivy Bridge and Sandy Bridge). Make sure you get an adequate cooling. The stock cooling is mediocre at best and the paste that comes with it is even worse. It doesn't space out evenly.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|When you know that this book is by Stephen King, and is about someone who goes back in time to save JFK from being assassinated, what are you expecting to see in the story?<br />Probably some drama, excitement, a bit of history, a fair bit of science fiction and something a bit on the &#34;weird&#34; side even.<br />What you don't expect is for a bulk of the story to be about the romance between the main character and a woman who lives in the 60s.<br />It was quite disappointing to me, to see the story start out fairly strong and be fairly compelling and interesting; if not a bit, well, down to earth and straight forward.  Then have it shift into being about the main character &#34;going native&#34; and developing a romantic relationship; complete with frequent mentions of their apparently quite lively sex lives.<br />After the halfway point of the book, I found it increasingly difficult to keep going and keep caring about the story or the characters.  It became quite obvious that saving JFK was more of a sideline to the story, more of a &#34;Oh my, this thing I really have to do is causing stress in my relationship!&#34; kind of thing.  There are still some fairly interesting moments in the story, but they become fewer and further between.  I keep hoping the story will pick up as it nears the end, but it is looking less and less likely.<br /><br />If you are a fan of stories that are vaguely science fiction and more leaning to period romance, then you will probably like this story.  If you are expecting a story that is more, well, Stephen King, and actually have a fair amount to do with JFK, then this isn't your book.
B000I8H7RI|1.0|We are long-time Amazon customers and recent Netflix customers.  We wanted to watch Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds and Netflix did not offer as such and so we rented via Amazon Instant Video for the first time.  We were supposed to be billed $3.99 for the HD version however we were billed $9.99.  We immeditaely contacted Amazon and they indictaed this was a billing error.  Yeah, right Amazon!  After more than 10-years of doing business w/ Amazon and finally gaining their trust this happened.  Now we do not tust Amazon and have asked them to cancel our Instant Video service.  We purchase ALOT ($X,XXX per year) and now this is jeopardy.  Amazon, shame on you for getting greedy!  We will contact the OOP (Office of the President) on Monday.

B00AN0KBJC|4.0|good story line ,keeps you wondering what will happen next with the certain actors in the story line ,well worth watching
B009NY43NY|1.0|How much this series has let me down.  I loved the first 7-8 books, then everything after that  I could have lived without.  I was so pissed at the last book with was so full of nothing but filler, pages and pages of recipes, errands and very little plot.  Then Eric does a 180 in character because the great Ms. CH thought the fans liked him too much and who are they to have an opinion.  It's like her boards, I tried to participate years ago but should you have an opinion and not read their 27 house rules before posting you were asked to go elsewhere or your post was removed.  Dead Ever After is my opinion of this author's work going forward.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|awesome movie ,good action ,keeps you watching  the whole time, I did think the end was kind of lame ,they could have made it longer and included the story of them getting back to the cave they came from,makes you wonder how they rebuilt the empire as in the first LOR movie because all the dwarfs alive are men ,so they have no women to have kids to start this huge empire ,but oh well,also they could have shown the dragon instead of its tail.over all a awesome movie ,the kind you can watch over and over
B0067TQQI8|1.0|I bought my Anker 8400 here on FEB 2013. Now it's July and the unit doesn't output. It can charge and use the flashlight only. I've owned the smaller units and they were so reliable. I paid good money thinking that an Anker has good reputation and reliable products. I'm not extremely upset, but anyone who reads this should consider buying a handful of their smaller units. So if one goes bad then it wouldn't be that great of a lost. I am still the proud owner of their 5600 unit. It is an absolute shame that the bigger and newer unit is less reliable than a first generation unit. When the 8400 did work, it took a long time for the battery to deplete.<br /><br />7-11-13 My history with Anker- 4/3/12 Astro 5600 (my first and still the best), 8/14/12 Multipurpose Cellphone battery charger, 1/15/13 1900mAh battery for HTC Amaze 4G, 2/18/13 Astro2 8400 (broken), 4/12/13 Astro 5600 (bought this for my friend as a b-day present, he used it at Disney World and loved it!)<br /><br />Final note: It is the low review ratings that really helps consumer and Anker. Consumer are informed of underlying problems and their symptoms and Anker can use this info as well. Anker can use this info to bring this problem to the attention of their manufacturer and their company's quality check team. In turn, this can turn around and be a positive thing for the company because good reviews will start to overshadow the bad ones. When you start accepting a replacement and then change the reviews to a perfect 5, you are lying to others by hiding the problem. That is why this review still stands. I love their product and I want to see Anker make better products.

B00280LYHS|5.0|This is  a great ending to n excellent series! I'm sad like many others that there astronomer books coming out but when you think of it, we grew up with Percy Jackson and all the other kids at Camp Half-Blood and this is one series that won't be forgotten!:)
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Had no expectations on this one, but THIS is what I call an Action movie!<br />The Story is not that new/thrilling, but the Action is handmade, this is the director's cut (I take it that it is uncut though).<br />The BD is codefree, Plays on European Players!
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book was soooooo great! I like how every book how everyone is getting older and stronger and how that affects relationships!=)

B00BXVKKPA|5.0|I really liked the single Live It Up on first listen but took a chance and bought the entire album and am so glad that I did!  Every song ROCKS!  No fillers.  Its hard to pick favorites but Ready to Rock, Animalize, Back in the Game, Cradle to the Grave, and Black Dog Barking are currently sticking out.  Ask me again next week.  It definitely fits into the 80s metal category but to say that this is simply nostalgic or very ACDC-ish does it a huge disservice because it sounds very fresh and new as if it belongs in the here and now.  It is really aggressive, turn it up, pump your fist, sing it in the car (try not to drive too fast), psych you up rock!  With all the crap that is going on in this world this album is just want the doctor ordered.  No preaching, politics, hate, or life sucks lyrics. Just grab some beer and a hot chick and have a party!  I have needed music like this for a long time!  Keep Rockin Airbourne!!

0062255657|5.0|I think the greatest compliment I can pay Neil Gaiman about THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE is much like the novel itself -- simple on the surface and yet, at the same time, deeply meaningful: I can't imagine anyone else writing this book.<br /><br />In THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE, Gaiman is as sharp as he's been since AMERICAN GODS, mixing the wonder and powerlessness of childhood with a deep understanding of the myths and stories humans have told one another since the beginning of time. Somehow, the combination of magical beauty and terrifying darkness in Gaiman's stories, sometimes taking place just moments apart and described in his magnificent, easy-going writing style, manages to feel entirely truthful -- as though when you're reading one of his books you're understanding something that you were only peripherally aware of during your day-to-day existence.<br /><br />THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE is about friendship and loss and childhood and fear, and how all of these come together to make us into the person we become as adults. There's a part in the story where our nameless narrator's best friend, a mysterious young girl named Lettie Hempstock, tells him that all adults are really just children in disguise, that they may look big and tough and in control, but on the inside, where no one can see, they're still the exact same person they were as a child. And as we see in the course of the book, no one is as powerless in their day-to-day lives as a child -- a fact most people seem to have forgotten but which Gaiman uses to great effect in these pages.<br /><br />Like the very best of Gaiman's work, this book is hard to explain, because it's about so very much. Perhaps the best way to describe it is this -- you'll be left thinking about this book for days afterwards, about the conversations characters had, about the themes Gaiman weaves together so effortlessly, about your own childhood and how that childhood still impacts who you are.<br /><br />So maybe I was wrong when I said Gaiman's singular ability to write this tale was the greatest compliment I could pay him; maybe it's the simple fact that I'm going to be thinking about this book and what it means for days to come.

0062255657|5.0|I loved this book.  It is better than American Gods, but not as good as Anansi Boys (because all stories are Anansi's stories).  It is a sweet story of friendship, growing up, returning home, and how things change over time.  The book does not lull as some books do and it tells the story.  It's beautifully to the point while being poetic and interesting at the same time.  It reads like a dream.  I don't mean that it is a dream to read.  I mean that it seems like a beautiful dream.  Anansi Boys and American Gods were stories of adventure and myth.  Book leaves you feeling like it is a dream that you have had rather than a story you have just read.  It works well for this book.<br /><br />A previous reviewer stated that it's a young adult story.  It probably is acceptable for young adults to read, but the lines between young adult and adult have really blurred since I was a teen.  In Neil Gaiman's world, this is an adult book.  It is not as fantastical as The Graveyard Book or Coraline, and there are things that Mr. Gaiman is trying to say that young adults won't understand yet.<br /><br />This book is told from the point of view of an adult revisiting an incident in his childhood.  There are many observations and changes that he realizes.  It's about how perspectives and memories change over time.  Perception is everything, and I think that's what this book is really about.
B004GYY714|2.0|Too much time buffering and too many drops, even with very strong wifi or network connection. Wouldn't use it if I had the good ol FM built in to Galaxy Tab 2.

076790592X|3.0|Because of the markings in the book, I complained and the vendor returned my money by crediting my account.  I assume he didn't realize the markings were there before he mailed it out.  He handled it very well.  I was still able to read the book in spite of the markings.  It was a good book.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finally got to read it and boy, it is a Michelangelo but a book, not a statue.  But still it is a piece of art work.  The author really is very descriptive on a characters feelings and emotions and talk about how much she makes the drama dramatic.  The only bad thing I half to say is it made it a little to sad when rue was dying, other then that I turkey love the book and if you haven't read it yet, READ IT NOW!!!!!!!!!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|One of the best animated movies I have seen in a long time. Laughed through the whole thing. The writing is fantastic and the voices are great.
B000U0O9FM|4.0|I thought it would be funny 2 title this with the pixies song at the end of the movie. I've read this book twice now; once in college (shortly after I saw the flick, and recently after I watched vanilla sky.) Interesting fact; the plotlines are real similar. And I think one of the reasons people don't like the movies is because they don't understand them. So let me clarify my point. It's told better in the movie that Tyler Dryden and ed Norton are the same person leading a more exiting life when they start to fall in love with Marla. This also happens in vanilla sky ( this is what people are missing) tom has fallen for Julia, and is sleeping with her; then Meets Sophia and falls for her, then the murder takes place (only really it's a car accident that tom swerved to avoid.) Then in a scene real similar to the one where Marla basically says eds crazy, Julia laughs like tom is crazy saying that she's Sophia! And it's like he's been with both girls all along(hence the beginning when Sophia says open your eyes, and at the end of the movie after tom says he'll see her in another life when they are both cats.
B001QW8QYS|4.0|I always thought this movie has aged better than the ponderous Ben Hur. Sure, it's quite kitschy and gaudy at times, but in the magnificent (though admittedly over the top) performance of Peter Ustinov, you get a sense of the madness and hubris that led to Rome's downfall. Somehow the religious elements in Quo Vadis are more genuinely inspired and moving than those in Ben Hur or the Robe, at least to me. Oh, and Leo Genn gives a good performance as Petronius.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|ive never played a game like this. really good idea and definitely fun. so many different options and nonstop action.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|I’ve been a long time fan of Paul McCartney. I have all of these songs on previous released CD's but I've been waiting for this re-mastered set to come out for a long time. This CD came out just about the time that the long awaited DVD &#34;Rockshow with Paul McCartney and Wings came out. The songs are the same on the CD and DVD so I can pop the CD in whenever I don't have time to watch the DVD. The sound quality was great.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|He loves it.  Perfect fit and size for his Kindle.  Light weight.  Everything about it is of very good quality.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game to keep your brain trained.  I wasn't sure what to expect but I really enjoy this.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|This one was a LOT more dark and the story was a bit more complicated than the first. I liked it, but wasn't overly in love as I was with the first one.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie starts out with a boring old motorcycle chase; but gets considerably better; so I wasn't disappointed with most of it.  It was delivered in a timely manner and case and dvd in great condition; thank you, seller.

B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|This was an interesting action movie....even my 9 year old grandson didn't lose interest; no nudity or extreme profanities, so I give it a thumbs up.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I Loved the game! It wasn't a cheesy version of floors at all. Can't wait for more levels. Hope they are coming soon? Keep up the good work!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This is one of those rare books in which the movie is better. The characters are flat by design and it's difficult to care about them on the page. The actors breathe life into them. Storyline is very one dimensional. I would recommend the movie.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Our 6 and 7-year-old grandchildren never stopped laughing throughout the movie; great movie for young kids; hilarious just watching the kids laugh.
B005F8CL1S|4.0|The recordings are fine, and the jackets and case is of  good quality. What I miss is that the lyrics of the songs are mostly missing. A few of the jackets do have the lyrics printed. The type is very small and mostly unreadable. I would think the publisher would include the lyrics to all songs in the albums in the descriptive folder that is in the box. What the folder does contain is the name of the songs in each album but no lyrics.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Having missed several episodes in this season it was really good to see them and start to work on more information in the hunt for RED JOHN
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised last year at how much I enjoyed Longmire, considering that it was a show on A&E which, let's face it, does not typically deliver the deepest of televised experiences. The show is fun and, while there is not much of a driving plot line (not like a Breaking Bad caliber show where every episode is designed to push the plot along and further the characters), it still delivers strong, believable characters that play off of each other quite nicely. In a nutshell, it's like adult Scooby-Doo. That said, the transition from the A&E show to Craig Johnson's book can be a little jarring at first. In a way it reminded me of Dexter (another series I had \\"watched\\" before I read). The plain and simple truth is that the show and the book are, clearly, two unique universes. The characters on the show are oftentimes loose interpretations of their printed counterparts, in particular Vic (for obvious reasons) is far less vulgar and Turk (read: Branch) is much more of an irritating rookie than a hometown tries-to-do-the-right-thing-but-still-has-a-rivalry-with-his-boss type. Some of the characters are rounder, others flatter. I particularly enjoyed the extra background on Henry Standing Bear and Ruby. Onto weighing the book on its own merits.<br />Walt is a pretty likable guy, which is a good start. He's surprisingly vulnerable and candid in his observations, something I think I attribute to a literary streak. Something tells me that Craig Johnson wanted everybody to know that he is a well-read cowboy. The end result is a cohesive blend of quasi-poetic imagery and internal reflections that offer readers a deeper understanding of who this character is and how conscious he is of everything going on around him. Several other characters, ones whom we do not have the luxury of reading their minds, are also very well developed. Henry Standing Bear, Vic, and, a personal favorite of mine, Lonnie Little Bird all stand out. Suffice it to say that they often steal the scene by keeping Walt on his toes for one reason or another.<br />Craig Johnson also spends a lot of time establishing the setting. Absaroka County (and the Rez to a lesser extent) are laid out beautifully, both in terms of physicality and their respective communities. The sometimes grating interplay, though not totally explored in this particular novel, between Absaroka and the Rez is palpable. This is particularly effective during flashback sequences where the apparent racial tension peaks.<br />To say that this book has any weaknesses would be misleading. What I will say is this: it is not a very deep read. The closest comparison I can find is with Jeff Lindsay's Dexter books. I won't say that either series has an \\"episodic\\" quality, but both endings arguably do little to advance their protagonists in any significant way. Without spoiling anything, after the epilogue Walt is more or less right back where he started. Nothing has shattered his view of the world or forced him to change himself. It just sort of felt like \\"this is what Walt felt like during his experiences.\\" It was still intriguing and well done, I'm just saying that this is no George R.R. Martin book where characters and motivations take center stage. That's not what Johnson was after though.<br />All in all it's a very good book and deserves the attention of any fan of the show. I look forward to reading what comes next.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very addictive program.  The only downside is how much time you are going to spend playing some of the individual layouts.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think it's a  good idea having so many games in one. People of all ages should enjoy playing this. Some people are complaining about this but I like that you have to earn your way to the next level by getting a certain amount of coins. It's fairly easy to do anyway.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game very fun playing would recommend to others has very multiple game options and is very fun to play
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Unlike the previous Die Hard movies which I thoroughly enjoyed (except perhaps part 2 but I still thought it was okay), I did not like this one very much. The movie felt repetitive and boring, and no where near as enjoyable as the previous installments of the series. If you haven't seen other Die Hard movies, I certainly wouldn't start with this one. If you have enjoyed the previous ones, you might like this one but I know I certainly didn't.
B00987MQRQ|1.0|Such a pointless novel. Don't waste your money. If your looking for the kind of entertainment it provides have your most portentous acquaintance tell you a horror story...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I bought this game a few weeks ago and just let it sit, can't remember why. Well one Saturday I was bored and decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did. I had more fun &quot;playing&quot; this game than any other I have bought. Buy this game NOW. You will not be disappointed.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Beautifully written. Leads you skilfully through the narrative which is inventive from beginning to end. Difficult to put down. Recommended.

B006GWO5NE|4.0|I didn't realize that one USB micro USB cord came with the Kindle fire but one can always use a back up.  I haven't tried it with my computer  yet but I'm sure it'll work fine
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book is a very well written a good follow up to Kite Runner which I enjoyed. Reading about the average people in Afganistan and how different their lives are from ours. The poor of the country have so very little. Sometimes living in America we forget to explore other countries and their customs. The more we learn about each other the better the world will be.
B00DHHWYAW|4.0|The Great Gatsby is a novel that has famously failed to cross into other mediums. With this latest adaptation, by director Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge!), I was curious to see how Luhrmann's unique style would translate to this classic story. I entered the theater with a fair amount of trepidation, especially after the largely mixed reviews that I'd read. To my surprise, however, I really enjoyed this adaptation.<br /><br />There were a couple of major alterations to the novel's original story, namely Nick's background and the events that take place after his time with Gatsby, but the film was mostly faithful to the novel. Many of the reviews argued against the director's style over substance approach, but I completely disagree with these claims. While there are moments of dazzling camera acrobatics and 3D effects, there are also many moments of quiet introspection. DiCaprio's Gatsby is probably the most sincere portrayal of this character that will ever appear on film. His interactions with both Maguire's Nick and Mulligan's Daisy seemed genuine, and I could really feel the soul of the man behind the facade he had made for himself.<br /><br />This unique interpretation will, no doubt, garner a variety of reactions amongst the faithful readers and casual moviegoers. In the end, it is probably impossible to perfectly translate the intentions of the novel into a film, but this one comes pretty close.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I noticed in the description for the DVD that it said no Special Features, I hope it isn't true.  That is the only reason I buy the DVD's because of the Special Features, I love it when the stars comment on an episode it makes it much more fun to watch.  Especially with Michael Weatherly he is so funny.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was amazed at how a simple love story could take you on a roller coaster ride that didn't want to let up enough for you to catch a breath.<br />It wasn't like a \\"normal\\" HEA, it was so much more. This book had me laughing out loud, squeezing the heck out of my Kindle, and wanting me to close my eyes until the chapter was over (like that was gonna happen), and yes there was a few times my eyes tickled with tears too.<br />I would recommend this book so many times over that is probably loose my voice just trying to get any one too give this a chance....and then yelling my support to the reader.
B002QNBRXS|3.0|I love Dexter and his sister, especially. I'd liketo watch more, but the violence upsets me.  It seems to get worse each season.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun but challenging. It is a very interactive game. When you start play it you really put your mind in action.
B0043JDUNS|3.0|I like Downey and his cohort, but there was so much action in this one that I actually got bored with it.
0385474547|5.0|I will ever look at Africa, its men, and its women I the same way. I am in love with the country, its culture before and after colonization. The book made me so interested on the topic and it was so full of life it practically read itself to me.
1400069742|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It satisfied on at least two levels.  First, it's a good read.  The best history books are interesting and informative but also are fun to read.  This one was fun to read.  I found I picked it up at times when I normally wouldn't pick up non-fiction just because it was so well-written.  I was sorry it was over.<br /><br />On the historical level, it filled in a chunk of time I'm surprised now that I didn't know more about.  I'm an avid reader of 20th-century American history especially military history.  I've read a lot of books on WWII but never read anything about the two years preceding Pearl Harbor.  I was surprised at how much anti-war feeling there was.  I was draft-age during the Viet Nam war and am very familiar with the violent ambivalence of that era.  The 1939-1941 period wasn't as violent but it was very ambivalent.<br /><br />I was also surprised at the description of Roosevelt's leadership -- or lack thereof.  He seemed to \\"lead from behind\\" and let others do the confrontation of ideas and goals.  Very different than the Roosevelt of the Depression.<br /><br />I read this book after I read Thomas Kessner's \\"The Flight of the Century\\", the recent biography of Charles Lindbergh.  It leaves off almost exactly where this book begins.  It is almost the second volume of Lindbergh's life (and that of Anne Lindbergh).  I recommend this pairing.  I think the book could have done with a little less focus on Anne Lindbergh, however.  Maybe I didn't understand, but it doesn't seem that she was much more than a footnote in the massive forces that shaped America's national dialog in the run-up to entering the war.  Yet the book has a considerable amount about her, including an afterword about her affair with her therapist.  Not sure what that has to do with American history.<br /><br />Overall an excellent book.  Highly recommended.
030014332X|5.0|This book was a first for me because I usually don't read these but it eased me into the nonfiction genre. It is overflowing with information and puts it in an understandable way. Try this out even if your a little scared. believ me I had a summer assignment on it and it was a breeze.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I think this app is ok I mean it is not as good as minecraft because not all of the things are made of blocks and the controls are kind of confusing but it is a lot like the Pc version of minecraft which I really do like.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  I've been very impressed by Mark Wahlberg's movies, so I decided to give this a try without knowing anything about it.  Great movie. Very suspenseful.  Well written, well acted.
0307730700|5.0|I have read many books in my life, and none has affected me in the way Fearless has.  Adam Brown and his family are a true inspiration, to say the very least. Adam's story is not just about being a SEAL. In fact, as you read the book, Adam being a SEAL becomes a footnote to the real meaning of his life. You become engrossed in who he was as a man and what God did in and through the man.  Adam's story is not just about the SEALS, religion, his overcoming addiction, his numerous injuries, his kindness, his perseverance, his faith, his family, and so on.  His story is about ALL of that in the package of a man and his life that is truly amazing. You just have to read the book to understand. Who knows if Adam's story would have ever been told had it not ended the way it did? So, I hope God heaps his blessings and comfort on Adam's family and friends.  They have suffered unimaginable loss so that we may see the grace of God as it is shown through Adam and his life. Thank you to the Brown family for sharing Adam with us, and thank you Mr. Blehm for writing this book and telling Adam's story.  Buy this book.  Read it with an open mind and heart. You may be changed forever.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|The product design does not seem to have been thought through.<br /><br />1. The film feed mechanism is terrible. There is a sprocket on just the top side, so you have to keep pushing down on the film to make it feed properly; I made the mistake of trying to feed a two frame negative, and the machine just swallowed it. The manual says that if this happened, you can dislodge with this \\"film retrieval strip\\", a flat piece of plastic without sprocket holes. It does not divulge what to do if this does not work. I finally had to dismantle the box to retrieve my negative!<br /><br />2. The SD card slot is cleverly designed so it  flips the write protect switch when you insert the card. You have to then take the card out, switch back and then reinsert it - a couple of times, usually.<br /><br />3. After all this trouble, the quality of the scans is not very good. I am willing to give the benefit of doubt on this one, because I am not sure if the negatives are bad or the machine.<br /><br />4. Note that as far as I can tell, the machine will only operate correctly with a card inserted i.e you can't just plug into a computer and try to save to hard drive (if you operate without a card and plug into a computer and press save, it goes through the motions and pretends to save!)<br /><br />- Sreenadh
B007FY9ZWI|2.0|This is not a bad music player, however the base version goes on automatically when I plug in headphones and I have been unable to turn off this feature, especially when I use Netflix or You Tube.

B00AYATBP6|5.0|This is my album of the year for 2013. From the exquisite songwriting to the fantastic playing, Steven Wilson et al have outdone themselves. There are no filler tracks and this is one of those albums where there is no need to skip tracks(unusual for today's digital download age). The title track has one of the most hauntingly beautiful yet catchy piano melodies of at least the last decade and Luminol is one of the most in-your-face songs of the neo progressive rock movement that started in the 90s. This is a landmark album that will be remembered and talked about for decades.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.Makes me cry every time I watch it. Can't think of anything else to say.
B0055D3EFU|2.0|Not the thriller I expected....more silly than scary...wouldn't watch a second time.  Lame movie...not suspenseful enough.  Not worth the rental
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I started this book and quickly realized it would be difficult to put down. James' writing style is enthralling - his tales quickly suck you in and unexpectedly hit you with a punchline full of unorthodox, yet novel advice. The book itself is a unique mix between a personal memoir and self-help manual. Yet, it never gets too instructional like other self-help books.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're looking for a way to supercharge your brain and live an altogether more fulfilling life, look no further. I can't recommend this book enough.

B008Y6WMEY|5.0|This could very well be a movie made today with a production value made to look from the sixties with how truly funny it is. There is enough satire to create a higher class of comedy but is loaded with quirky scenes that are contrastingly hilarious, and apart from the over the top Dr. Strangelove, the acting is amazing. The level of seriousness this movie takes in lie of some of the unbelievably outlandish scenes makes it one of the greatest cinema satires ever made.

Unheard of in the USA, as is typical with the monopoly and ripoff culture that dominates professional music, this composer was considered a hero in South Africa, of all places. Through the amazing efforts of one great person, the composer has now had his day in the bright light of well deserved fame. even receiving an honorary degree from the great Wayne State University in Detroit, a great city long overdue for some serious rebuilding.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|When I first heard this storyline I didn't think I would like it, but Stephen King has done it again. I was hooked on the first page. Great read!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Definitely looking forward to new levels. Looked and worked great on my S4.<br /><br />overall a really good free game that I would probably pay for a premium version with longer or more levels.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google is great. It makes everything easy to use.  I understand instructions quick. It work well for business and travel.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is so good I could not stop watching one episode after another! Looking forward to the start of season 4.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|Compilation of birth and growing up life babies in four parts of the world was awesome.<br />Knowing the cultures in short and some ideas and tips on how moments might be captured for our own baby.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|I don't understand the poor reviews, my wife and I laughed all the way through. Maybe you need to be near 40 to get the life jokes
0671042858|4.0|I read the book in 3 hours! Stephen King book scare me but this book is good. Unfortuneatley, Tom Gordon's career took a nose dive
B003TSEEDY|5.0|wow totally amazing one of my favs everyone should read it ok its the best swag rock on yolo lol
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it is great and very fun!! i love how there is no hints given and you do all by yourself
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Neat game, I like the level of difficulty. It was easy enough for my daughter and hard enough for me.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|I like this series very much, but a lot of it is also predictable.  However, I wish there was a lot more series like this on television today rather than Honey BOO BOO.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|I really liked it.I felt connected to and cared about the characters right away. I felt it ended to suddenly though. I wanted more.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Very funny and insightful.  I went through some of the things that Tina did so I really related to this book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've used the app for about two years, I think, and really enjoy the ease and flexibility because I have in on my android phone and tablet. Very good job folks!<br /><br />Thanks.
B005721W9O|5.0|This is a wonderful venue to showcase the range of Alan Rickman's talents. My entire family loved the subtle and nuanced performances depicting the interplay among the members of the cast. Tony Shaloub was superb.
B004KKX80A|4.0|My son love to play Beyblades, he is enjoying it everyday.  He hope to see more better Beyblades so teen can enjoy.  Thanks
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My grandchildren watched the movie twice and were mesmerized both times. The little girls and the cousins were wonderful. The characters of the little girls were charming.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|This movie is fantastic and this product was shipped as stated, in its package, completely sealed.  I am satisfied and can't wait to watch it over and over!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie cracks me up. I thought it was going to be the movie version of Glee which I was getting really tired of, but I was pleasantly surprised.
B00D02Z1EA|3.0|Some very catchy parts but overall this album left me somewhat unsatisfied.<br /><br />I've always been a huge ABR fan and have seen them in concert a handful of times. Unfortunately this entire album reminded me of the  &#34;Salt & Light&#34; track from their last album, Leveler. Lots of talking, lots of melodies, lots of &#34;pretty.&#34;<br /><br />Don't get me wrong- there were plenty of breakdowns, but this just didn't sound like them. Then again, my favorite album of theirs is Messengers, so perhaps my review here is just biased.<br /><br />Like I said, some catchy parts, some great riffs, but I wasn't completely satisfied with this album like I always have been by previous ABR albums.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It's great to get a boxed set of these movies. It was exactly what Dad wanted. I was also happy he hadn't started collecting before that.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Fogerty does it again.  Very well done album that every Fogerty/CCR fan must have.  A few new songs and some great remakes such as the title track which features fantastic solo by Tom Morello which is worth the price of the cd in itself.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|great game just wish it wasn't so focused on real money 4 stars is my vote not a huge fan for games that let money give you a massive edge
B00BLGZDVS|2.0|went nowhere, characters you dont care about. No new light shed on scientology, fail,fail,fail. Good acting performances by entire cast.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Read the first book and it was ok.  Decided I stared the series I needed to finish it book 2 is better then the first
B00APYKXFS|2.0|There's options for music but all of them are annoying, the sparks are too much and difficulty level: nopenopenope. There's no goal in this game, instead attempt to no die
B00APYKXFS|1.0|Played for 5 minutes.  Experenced 3 random resets, one of which reset the phone... fix this and i might reevaluate.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This was a great movie. My wife and I thought it was cute. It was nicely done and we especially loved the minions.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|Fantastic album.  Great to hear Scott, Mike and Eddie getting back to what they've probably been wanting to do for the past 15+ years.  Todd sounds great...yup, sounds like he was influenced by Geoff...so what.  Buy it...won't regret it.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Like most people I have watched Judy Garland hundreds of times singing \\"Over the Rainbow\\", but I had never read the actual book until now.<br />It is definitely a children's book, written at a level that a young child could appreciate - simple words and sentences.  But adults could certainly appreciate it as well.<br />Although the movie and the book overlap in content to a great degree, there are enough differences that you don't anticipate everything that happens next.<br />It is a short book so most readers won't take long to get through it.  Worth reading for yourself, but a good chapter book for bedtime reading for children and grandchildren.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Swaze and Grey make beautiful music together. Great story have watched many times.<br />Good chemistry between them. Story of first love,growing up and facing real life challeges that profoudly affect all<br />the characters in the story.I think everyone can identify with some aspects in this beautifully moving story.
B000UR9T8W|5.0|The Spider-Man movies came in separate cases with a box to hold the three dvd cases in, just as pictured.  The first two were special editions, and the third was regular.  All wide-screen. The box had a little minor wear to the edges, but the DVD cases were perfectly in tact.  The first two DVD's played wonderfully, no problems at all.  The third DVD had some difficulty starting, it kept saying there was an error and that it would &#34;skip over damaged parts&#34;.  I took it out twice, wiped it and re-tried, but it didn't work.  I decided to give it one more try and really thoroughly cleaned it and put it back in and it worked perfectly fine.  No errors or mess-ups at all while watching it!<br /><br />So even with that little issue, I give it 5 stars because they all work just fine right now.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|The excitement of this movie goes up and up until you are about to loose it!!! I had a great time. If I have the chance, I will see it again!<br />To anybody who likes a good thrill, good actors, true story, and on and on.....choose this one!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I love this series so far and This second book has not disappointed me.  Cant wait for the tv series.
B005LAII08|4.0|Best graphics and love the story line the baby bears were very cute. If you have seen how to train your dragon you will love this movie.<br /><br />Matthew aged 11
B0031R5K68|5.0|It has great and deep ideas but at the same time it can be digested by non native English speakers. Very impressive and logic book. You can use it even as sightseeing guidelines for the Washington DC.<br />Gor
B005LAII6C|4.0|Paranorman had a great story line, good 3d and great surround sound. I loved norman he's got guts to go in front of the zombies.<br />Matthew aged 11
B001UDPAB0|3.0|Oceans Eleven was fast paced and interesting, as was Oceans Twelve.  Oceans Thirteen just didn't<br />have the timing and seemed to drag.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|would be great for kids and adults Alot of fun, easy to play. love being able to pick different horses, feed them, groom, and go to complain
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|if you cannot visit Tibet, Japan, Africa, etc, this is as close as you can come to it. Very impressive.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Good read but daunting at times. Such a wonderful dream-like story but often hard to grasp the scenes and make them come to life.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|Bad idea to have the protagonist die, what's the idea? You can substitute a protagonist and carru on the love story! Rubbish!!!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Good show a working mother who is trying to juggle work and her children.  Good character in the movie the struggles she has to put up with in order to make it in this messed-world.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|Too much to buy and not enough money. I don't like that you have to add neighbors to progress. Just let me play.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I got the cover for my wife's Kendal she uses every day. Nice heavy leather, good construction. She loves it.
B00CEIGYAG|4.0|I like this dance song. It's fun to dance too and it takes me back to the 90's. Great job!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is my favorite of all bingo games, with my kindle I can play anywhere and at any time I choose.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|In only two sittings I finished this gripping story. I felt so connected to the family I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. I am amazed that this is the author's first novel. She must have been channeling their soul's stories.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|So many reviewers have included spoilers that new ones need not bother.  The strength of this book for me comes from the author's refusal to be pegged, second-guessed, maudlin, chagrined, judgmental, or any of the things that a reader might project into the story before turning the next page or reading the next paragraph.  Like reality, it's impossible to know exactly what's going on and at the same time impossible not to.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|i love it. this game is the most fun of anything else on my kindle. i sit and play for hours. Best game
B00BZAJMWG|3.0|As talented as Jennifer Lawrence is (and that's a lot) and as toothsome as Bradley Cooper is (also not inconsiderable), and despite solid characterization by De Niro, this movie is a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy.  Would that a swap for Winter's Bone were possible for Jennifer.  As for Bradley Cooper, even running around in a yard-size trash bag didn't make him as nuts as his dad.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I caught a bit of it while my family watched it. They enjoyed it a lot.  For myself, I did not watch much of it..But it is an ok film for most people
B009NY43NY|3.0|I love Sookie but this book stunk.  I know a lot of people disliked the ending.  I just found it poorly written.
B003PIUBZS|3.0|The first season is the better of the seasons. I understand that there is a lot of sex and violence and I do not normally go for it, but it is so true to life.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|The movie did a good job of portraying the plight of poorer members of society and the areas of gray that exist when judging others.
0375851569|5.0|This item was purchased as a gift for my daughter's baby registry.  It was a hit.  This gift was a great addition to the baby's room.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|We love this series and look forward to every episode. The acting is top notch, the writing superb, the noir is often creepy, and the music, especially the intro,  sets the tone.<br /><br />Watch it!
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|This video was purchased for my granddaughter.  It made a nice addition to her DVD collection.  I would recommend this purchase to anyone who would like to enjoy an hour or two with friends and family.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I could not put this down .  A beautiful story of overcoming obstacles, internal and external.  It was told through the eyes of the kids which shed light on their own thoughts. Just great!
B001LF3YQK|5.0|I purchased this item to add to the &#34;wish list&#34; for my grandson as my daughter was expecting her first baby.  It is a wonderful product and I would heartily recommend it to anyone as a gift or addition to an already existing baby registry.
B0096BIENY|3.0|Was a little disappointed in their performance. They seem to be competing with each other in singing the songs.<br />Also, found the choice of songs less than exciting.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This video was purchased for my granddaughter.  It made a nice addition to her DVD collection.  I would recommend this purchase to anyone who would like to enjoy an hour or two with friends and family.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Husband loved the movie! great action and story would recommend to anyone loving lots of action and great a story too. Denzel acting was the best in this movie ever!
B00A83075M|5.0|This video was purchased for my granddaughter.  It made a nice addition to her DVD collection.  I would recommend this purchase to anyone who would like to enjoy an hour or two with friends and family.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Well made movie, if you love horses and the history of one of the greatest horses ever, Disney did a fabulous job on telling the true story regarding Secretariat. Love it! would recommend to all ages happy and sad parts so get the Kleenex out!
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|This video was purchased for my granddaughter.  It made a nice addition to her DVD collection.  I would recommend this purchase to anyone who would like to enjoy an hour or two with friends and family.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am fairly new to Michael Connelly, and Harry Bosch, but am a fan now.  Will probably go back and read them<br />in order.  Bosch is a sympathetic, flawed, man of principle, whose inner life has its struggles  The plots have ample twists and turns, keep you turning the pages.<br />I recommend  it to those who like the detective genre.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|This video was purchased for my granddaughter.  It made a nice addition to her DVD collection.  I would recommend this purchase to anyone who would like to enjoy an hour or two with friends and family.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This games is awesome. It gives you hints when you need help. Also you can play with others without logging onto social media. Plus at the if you know you won it will autocompleted for you. You can changes the background of the screen and the background of the cards. You change the setting and so much more. Plus its FREE! You have to get this game.
B001HN6918|5.0|This video was purchased for my granddaughter.  It made a nice addition to her DVD collection.  I would recommend this purchase to anyone who would like to enjoy an hour or two with friends and family.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Well done grabs your attention and you cant stop till you get it done. Clues build, challenging for the super detective in us.
B008476HBM|5.0|I love this book. Many people relate to characters in movies or books, and I relate to Elizabeth. She and I are very similar. I read this to understand about human failings and the hope that love brings.
B008N1LL42|5.0|a really detailed movie all about navy ships, it is a great film. The actors were the rightones all had chemistry
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|I normally hate outrageous movies but in this case... Incredible humor. Incredible situations. Incredible acting.<br /><br />An amazing film for a night with friends!
1878424319|5.0|I have purchased many copies of this little book for family and friends.  This book is a good personal guide for folks with personal problems with life.<br />The agreements you make with yourself and understanding the purpose of those agreements is a simple but very helpful tool for everyday life.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|These fit perfectly and are well worth the money.  They are truly invisible.  I have tried all brands that claim to be invisible but  They still show above the front of the shoe.
193700788X|1.0|After reading this book I kept thinking I was being punked!  This was a joke right?!?  I have been a Sookie fan for years waiting for each book to come out. I even defended the last couple books which had horrible reviews. It was as if Charlaine Harris had given up when writing this one!  The writing and the plot in this book was just lazy!  It was like she brought all these characters back, threw them in, and just made them disappear.  It was sloppy and made no sense!  Eric was hardly in this book.  The Eric that Sookie had loved and fought with for the last nine books had disappeared and been replaced by a wuss!  The Eric that I had come to know and love (iinitially hated Eric and Sookie being together) would have done anything to get what he wanted.  Here in this book we are to accept that he was going to go quietly being a consort for the next 200 years to the queen!  Really!!!  And you end it with her being with Sam!  I understood why Sookie saved his life in the last book because he was her best friend.  That is just it, her best friend!  It was made known over and over through out the series that he was nothing more and now she is falling for him and has these magical feelings for him!  Whatever!  I could have accepted Sookie ending up with Eric, Bill, Alcide, or even Quinn but not Sam!  This last book should have been about Eric fighting to free himself from the agreement his maker had arranged.  But no Eric goes off in the night to marry the queen and Sookie is just like whatever lets get it on with Sam...UGH!  Charlaine Harris you are a huge disappointment for me with the way you wrote this last book!  I guess you let all your creative juices die with the other books.  You rushed through with this book, throw it out there, and expect us fans to be happy and accept the garbage you wrote!  Garbage that is exactly what it is and a complete waste of my time!  I am not always expecting a happy ending when I read books but I expect the author to actually put forth an effort when writing!  My kid could have wrote a better book than this one!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This series is amazing. From the costumes to the beautiful scenery. The story line is awesome. It keeps you needing to know what will happen next!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this, codes, numbers, hidden logic. Use your memory, observe, think, playful, and all the other stuff you can think of
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|It's a really entertaining game, I've played it on the Iphone, an Android, but for some reason the game won't work correctly on my Kindle Fire. The game freezes about every three seconds. If this can be fixed, then the game would get five stars from me.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very addicting. I played all then levels in one night. I am hoping for more levels to come soon. This was a fun game and you really have to use your brain.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|During a seasonal hiatus I go back on Prime and watch each episode over. Nuance missed at original viewings is even more delicious. I am so impatient for each new season I fidget and<br />fume.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very addicting. I played all then levels in one night. I am hoping for more levels to come soon. This was a fun game and you really have to use your brain.
B009X011UQ|3.0|It was not what I was expecting but it works zz the photo looks better than the actual product that's all
B008K9SG9K|5.0|You are reading this review and you have not yet PURCHASED this CD?<br />Just stop reading and buy it. That simple.<br /><br />They have a couple well-known songs, but the entire CD is great ... if you know and like the popular stuff, preview the rest to find out that you are a fool for not buying it sooner!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Any DR. WHO fans out there will love this product.  It makes noise like the DR's and lights up.  It's also an ink pen and an invisible ink pen.  The invisible ink shows up when you shine the flashlight on it.  My husband loved his father's day gift.
B001PB3RU8|4.0|I am still not sick of FLORENCE & THE MACHINE.<br /><br />She's got pipes and has done a great job in putting this set together.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I loved this movie :) It was very entertaining and is definitely worth it. Good story line, it has action AND `mushy' stuff so a guy and girl can both enjoy this movie
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Mickey Haller in another thrilling Lincoln Lawyer book. I can't wait for the next one. I am anxious to see what legal rabbits Connelly is going to pull out of his hat next. I know I wont be despointed!
B0059WTMLW|4.0|I like the layouts and variety available.  There's a great range of difficulties and color options, plus the ability to mark notes on the squares.  Although I know it's supposed to make the game easier, I don't always appreciate that it automatically deletes other marked numbers when you choose a number for a square.  Also, sometimes the controls are touchy.
B004UID2LC|3.0|its ok its like buying music from the music but sometimes it freezes up and wont let you download on your mp3
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I thought that with the Prime account that I pay for that I would be able to enjoy the free book they tout.  Only to find out in the small print that it is only available on the hardware kindle, not other hardware.  Disappointed.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|A beautiful movie for the true romantic of spirit. Not a lovey, kissy romance, but the responsibilities and joys of lifelong friendships.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed this book more thant Hosseini's &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; because the story line, although at times sad, was not as upsetting as &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; to me. I liked the way he flowed from one character to the next through the years, piecing together the history of the family that was torn from each other.
1416955070|5.0|Story to me is like a mixture of Vampire Diaries & Harry Potter! The environment that CC creates is definitely magical & very alluring to fixate ur reading thoughts on. I'm totally enjoyn Book 1, disappointed only to wait for the whole Amazon set in 1wk b/c i'll be done w/ bk 1 by tonight! I'm not a YA, more like a OA, older adult who enjoys any book regardless of age group. If the synopsis sounds interesting, fictional or non-, i'll read it. Wont bother w/ lengthy appraisals for this series, just buy it & enjoy!<br /><br />P.S. THANK GOODNESS IT WILL BE A MOVIE, YEAH, HOPE IT DOES IT JUSTICE.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I find that when I start a Neil Gaiman novel I get so drawn in to the story that before I know it the  book is finished. This story was magical and original and just a shade different than his other stories. I enjoyed it very much.
B008602KQI|3.0|The premise was a good one and gawking at Jennifer Lawrence makes any movie better, but overall the movie was disappointing. We all knew what the outcome was from the beginning, right? Way too much attempt at being a tear jerker (when the cute little girl dies). Also these people were allegedly fighting for their lives with only one winner, so we're to believe that in certain situations they let someone go out of the goodness of their hearts.....c'mon.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|this game is very interesting the graphics are well put together would recommend for all my friends to play it. if you like hidden object games this is the game to play
0790731509|5.0|I think this movie made Newman an icon. The movie is good from start to finish. Great acting from everyone. I've seen this movie quite a few times but I decided it was worth owning. If you haven't seen this movie, you should!
B000LC55F2|5.0|I don't remember ever seeing the advertisement for this movie on tv but I recently saw the trailer for it on another dvd. I enjoyed watching it and I believe you will too. Just wait till the ending, it will leave you scratching your head.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I was reminded of Catcher in the Rye throughout this book, in the style of writing and the sort of childlike way the main character has of thinking and talking. And, the resistance to facing the reality of &#34;growing up&#34; - at 35. And later in the book, Catcher in the Rye is referenced, so you know this was intentional. This was a good book - you are kept guessing about what really happened to put him in this mental state, and the twists do surprise. What I liked most though, was the humor and compassion with which it all played out. A good read.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I am a big fan of the jigsaw puzzles online and was so happy to find one on my Kindle Fire!!!  Just started using it and so far I'm very happy with it!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Love this game, easy to play and understand. Played this on the computer, now with this app on the kindle fire much easier to play anywhere you go.
0316056871|4.0|This book is an easy read and written very well, it's more conversational and personal. However, I feel it's audience was more directed towards females so boys beware, though still worth reading.
161655164X|5.0|It was worthy. I like art book and this game.    I missed Survival Edition because it was sold out s***ty.  So This was the only way to take this book.    I appreciate it I can buy it. Cost is little too high though.  But, compare to ebay. This price is the lowest price I can take.    It was a good deal.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is fun I really like it because interpreter harder but also a lot more fun when you get father ahead all of my cousin have it and they have other ones but they are all veary veary fun
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game ingeniously combines strategy and multiplayer competition, leading to an endless experience. Unlike most games in the building genre, this game has excelled above the point-and-click tediousness.
B00DGXGUSY|4.0|If you like heavy metal  Deceiver has it all. It will make you bang your head and scare the crap out of anyone. There are a couple songs I would of switched around on the playlist. Some of my favorite bands released albums this month and Amon Armoth is now one of them.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just the right amount of difficulty. I really did enjoy it. Not lame lime a lot of the other escape games.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It gave you more because you needed it. Everything is tied so nice but you want more. It reads so smooth that only days have gone by. You won't want to put it down. Can't wait for book #3.
B00846REIS|5.0|Characters are strong with problems. The story has a good back bone and details Can't wait to read the next book.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I wish tiles were a bit larger. A good game for people that aren't video game crazy. Background music smooth!
0345803507|4.0|I had read it last year. While lending this copy to a coworker, it was lost in Hurrican Sandy. The set had to be made complete, again.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Best game just to kill time and never gets boring besides having to use Internet<br /> access but never mind that
B007TK77QE|3.0|A bit slow in places didn't grab me early enough. When I persevered it picked up and was in the end a good story.
B007SGM084|5.0|I wasn't sure I would be interested in reading the trilogy, but when my daughter bought me my Kindle Fire for mother's day, my sister's kept telling me they where a must.  After having read all three books, I completely understand why my sister's have read them three or four times already.  I could not put my Kindle away once I begin to read them, staying up all night sometimes because I just couldn't get enough of Christian and Anastasia.  I am so looking forward to reading more of E L James, her writing was amazing, the books were intriguing, exciting, erotic, ...  I highly recommend to anyone over 21; female, male, couples.
B0083F5J7S|4.0|I love Maroon 5 but I didn't care for a few of the songs on this CD. I know every band has a few that fans are not that into so I hope the next one will rate a 5.
B00AH6ACFA|5.0|Metallica never fails to deliver. This album is definitely one of my favorites even next to Ride the Lightening and Justice For All. Without question, Metallica is one of the greatest bands of all time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I had never played a puzzle game before. This was challenging, but not so difficult that I couldn't just play the game and have fun. I would definitely purchase again - and any new games they put out
B00AWKZSNM|2.0|To: HyperDrive, Sanho Corporation,<br /><br />Re: iUSBportCAMERA<br /><br />I purchased the iUSBportCAMERA and used it at a photo shoot over several days. I showed my customers their images using CLIENT MODE. It worked great. Images showed up after I snapped the shutter within a half second or so. Everything worked fine.<br /><br />Then the there was an update to the iUSBport APP in the iTunes Apple Store on July 2nd and I now have problems.<br /><br />Please see the image at this location: http://j.mp/1a6rVm4<br /><br />It is a screenshot of the stored images on my iPad. You'll note that the thumbnail is different but more importantly the file size transferring over is now huge, 10 times the size previously. This means each image takes a LONG LONG time to show up on my iPad for my clients. Not good.<br /><br />I have changed nothing else re: the iPad or the DSLR to which I am using. The only change was the update to the iOS APP.<br /><br />I would sincerely appreciate ANY feedback and proposed soutions regarding this. I have written numerous messages to Sanho and HyperDrive but have received no response.<br /><br />Thanks!
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I have been reading this book to my class at the end of the school year for several years now. It does not seem to matter the age...12-17 year olds choke up at the end. Highly recommend !
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I haven't finished reading this book, but I have recommended it to my friends.  I have seen the movie, and I think reading the book has given me a better understanding of the movie.  It's a little difficult to read, however, once I start reading, it's difficult to put down.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I used this Behringer Xenyx 802 Mixer 0n stage.  I have 2 keyboards, one bass guitar, one mic for grand piano.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|This was a great purchase.  This is made so durable that you know you will be able to use it for more than one season.  Colors and appearance in picture does not do the real item justice.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|This was the first book that I read by Johnson. Found it thought provoking and humorous. Interesting twists and turns
B009UNGYHG|3.0|I lost my original charging cable for my Legend so had to consider the best item to buy to replace it. I ended up choosing this based upon what it can do, and the positive reviews.<br /><br />It turned out to be quite a lot larger and bulkier than I expected which means I'm reluctant to carry it in my pocket (jeans) when I can just carry the headset. Also it costs $30 which is a significant amount towards a replacement headset so it's like of like paying 30% of the headset's value as insurance. Also I've had headsets break in the past (perhaps from repeatedly being in pocket without a case) and Plantronics overnighted a free replacement each time anyway. So overall I don't think the protection of the case is all that important, and then you have to consider the $30 cost and the bulkiness.<br /><br />The charging aspect is good, but again there are drawbacks. The case requires a standard USB cable be plugged into it each time you recharge it, and that's more awkward than the nice magnetic (but proprietary) charging cable that you get to use if you directly charge the headset. Having multiple recharges available to you is good, but how often will you run down the original 7 hour charge and then find it easier to use the case to recharge, versus a normal charger?<br /><br />Overall, I was attracted by the features, but in reality I've found them of limited use, and they come with some drawbacks, especially the $30 cost.
B007MDB71O|4.0|I saw the ads... Giant white apes and a man who can leap tall buildings in a single bound, mysterious energy, and deserted (Egyptian?) cities.  Then the title. John Carter.  I turned to my friends and said, \\"I think this is supposed to be on Mars, but I can't tell. I think it's from the Tarzan writer, they had comics of this in the '70's\\".  No one knew what I was talking about and frankly, didn't care.  Neither did I.  It looked exciting, polished, CGI'd, but these movies always look good in the trailers.  I figured I might go see it, if the reviews were positive.  They were, actually, but were overshadowed by what a bomb it was, an historic bomb.  So I forgot and went about my business.<br /><br />It hung around the RedBox for months before I rented it. I put the Blu-ray in and went about my chores, pausing to sit when something caught my attention.  I found myself sitting more and more, somewhat confused but enthralled nonetheless.  Therns?  Tharks? Thoats? Thans?  The language was as difficult as the concept.  Air on Mars?  Civilizations? Airborned superhumans?  But by the magnificent ending, I realized that what was needed to watch this film is a little education, a little history.<br /><br />This was written by a man from the Victorian age and thus has high concepts with a certain Jules-Verne-like quality of \\"science be damned, full speed ahead!\\". Edgar Rice Burroughs' books predate practically everything. His is an inaccurate but highly romanticized vision of Mars as not a dead but dying planet, ruled by far-flung cities in a futuristic feudal age.  The film perfectly captured that idealized vision of Martian knights and ladies fighting fierce foes, losing loves, and championing causes.  It had a very old school structure, a completely charming novel tale with fantastic creations set to exhilirating music.<br /><br />Watching the Blu-ray features, I was struck by how much was lost in the cuts made to shorten the film.  Certain \\"Huh?\\" moments that added to theconfusion were explained by simple lost scenes.  Perhaps the director would be persuaded to make a \\"Special Edition\\" restoring some of the narrative clarity.  I had to watch the film a few times before all the elements gelled.  I fault the Walt Disney Co. for completely dropping the ball on this one.  I've read reports that their film \\"Mars Needs Moms!\\" tanked at the box office and they all assumed that \\"Mars is out!\\" and took the name and ANY direct reference to it in the title and the ad campaign.  They never ONCE mentioned its source.  Sad but true.  This film so enchanted me I ordered the John Carter of Mars volumes from Amazon.  The movie is fairly based on much of its source material but updated for modern audiences, removing the very dated female and slavery references and extremely stylized and stilted old-school English.<br /><br />My favorite movie to watch in the dead of a Chicago winter.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the evolving relationship of Anna & Mr. Bates.  Can Thomas & O Brien be any more unlike able?  What evil connivers !
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Another great movie from Bruce Willis.  Can't wait for Red 2 to come to theatres.  Don't go to the movies often because they are full of progressive liberal agendas that I won't support with my money, but Bruce Willis is conservative and I will support him.
B005K17RU0|5.0|onfo. was dead on the money. many great features! ! all videos worked well on my kindle fire and weather maps are really great!
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Quirky characters and a story line that keeps you guessing what the final outcome will be. A lesson in accepting what is and what people are even with all their faults.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is a somewhat difficult and challenging. It will push your imagination and brain to places they have never been. Well worth the money. Try it if you dare - you will enjoy it for literally hours. Addictive does little to explain this game. Enjoy.

1400067820|5.0|Pardon me for the review title. My praise of this book is beyond words. The author deserves a Nobel prize. In short, a must for any trader, investor, and philosopher.<br /><br />p.s. Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.<br />The fragilista defaults to thinking that what he doesn't see is not there, or what he does not understand does not exist. At the core, he tends to mistake the unknown for the nonexistent. Pg9<br />A complex system, contrary to what people believe, does not require complicated systems and regulations and intricate policies. The simpler, the better. Complications lead to multiplicative chains of unanticipated effects. Because of opacity, an intervention leads to unforeseen consequences, followed by apologies about the unforeseen aspects of the consequences, then to another intervention to correct the secondary effects, leading to an explosive series of branching unforeseen responses, each one worse than the preceding one. Yet simplicity has been difficult to implements in modern life because it is against the spirit of a certain brand of people who seek sophistication so they can justify their profession....But simplicity is not so simple to attain. Steve Jobs figured out that \\"you have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.\\"  Pg11<br />Just as being nice to the arrogant is no better than being arrogant toward the nice, being accommodating toward anyone committing a nefarious action condones it. Pg15<br />The sword of Damocles represents the side effect of power and success; you cannot rise and rule without facing this continuous danger - someone out there will be actively working to topple you. And like the sword, the danger will be silent, inexorable, and discontinuous. It will fall abruptly after long periods of quiet, perhaps at the very moment one has gotten used to it and forgotten about its existence. Black Swans will be out there to get you as you now have much more to lose. Pg24<br />Redundancy is ambiguous because it seems like a waste if nothing unusual happens. Except that something unusual happens - usually. Pg45<br />If human fights the last war, nature fights the next one. Your body is more imaginative about the future than you are. Consider how people train in weightlifting; the body overshoots in response to exposures and over prepares. This is how bodies get stronger. Pg46<br />Humans tends to do better with acute than with chronic stressors, particularly when the former are followed by ample time for recovery, which allows the stressors to do their jobs as messengers. Pg58<br />When you starve yourself for food, it is the bad proteins that are broken down first and recycled by your own body - a process called autophagy. This is a purely evolutionary process, one that selects and kills the weakest for fitness. Pg71<br />When you are fragile, you depend on things following the exact planned course, with as little deviation as possible - for deviations are more harmful than helpful. This is why the fragile needs to be very predictive in its approach, and conversely, predictive systems cause fragility. When you want deviations, and you don't care about the possible dispersion of outcomes that the future can bring, since most will be helpful, you are antifragile. Further, the random element in trial and error is not quite random, if it is carried out rationally, using error as a source of information. If every trial provides you with information about what does not work, you start zooming in on a solution so every attempt becomes more valuable, more like an expense than an error. Pg71<br />My characterization of a loser is someone who, after making a mistake, doesn't introspect, doesn't exploit it, feels embarrassed and defensive rather than enriched with a new pieces of information, and tries to explain why he made the mistake rather than moving on. Pg74<br />A turkey is fed for a thousand days by a butcher; every day confirms to its staff of analysts that butchers love turkeys with increased statistical confidence. The butcher will keep feeding the turkey until a few days before Thanksgiving. Then comes that day when it is really not a very good idea to be a turkey....The key here is that such a surprise will be a Black Swan event; but just for the turkey, not for the butcher.....We can also see from the turkey story the mother of all harmful mistakes; mistaking absence of evidence (of harm) for evidence of absence. Pg93<br />It seemed, wrote Machiavelli, that in the midst of murders and civil wars, our republic became stronger and its citizens infused with virtues....a little bit of agitation gives resources to souls and what makes the species prosper isn't peace, but freedom. - Pg96<br />GDP growth can be obtained very easily by loading future generations with debt - and the future economy may collapse upon the need to repay such debt. It's like cholesterol, seems to be a Procrustean bed reduction that has been used to game systems.  For a plane that has a high risk of crashing, the notion of speed is irrelevant, since we know it may not get to its destination, economic growth with fragilities is not toe be called growth. Pg160-161<br />Seneca's asymmetry: more upside than downside can come simply from the reduction of extreme downside (emotional harm) rather than improving things in the middle. Pg163<br />Make sure that the probability of the unacceptable (risk of ruin) is nil. - Ray Dalio.  Such a rule gets one straight to the barbell. Pg166<br />If you  have \\"optionality\\", you don't have much need for what is commonly called intelligence, knowledge, insight, skills, and these complicated things that take place in our brain cells. For you don't have to be right that often. All you need is the wisdom to not do unintelligent things to hurt yourself and recognize favorable outcomes when they occur. This property allowing us to be stupid, or, alternatively, allowing us to get more results than the knowledge may warrant.  I will call the philosopher's stone for now, or convexity bias, the result of a mathematical property called Jensen's inequality. Pg181<br />In the book \\"What I learned losing a million dollars,\\" the protagonist/author remarks that a fellow named Joe Siegel, one of the most successful trader in a commodity called \\"green lumber\\", actually thought that it was a lumber painted green (rather than freshly cut lumber, called green because it had not been dried.) And he made it his profession to trade the stuff. Meanwhile the narrator was into grand intellectual theories and narratives of what caused the price of commodities to move, and went bust........So let us call the green lumber fallacy the situation in which one mistakes a source of necessary knowledge - the greenness of lumber - for another, less visible from the outside, less tractable, less narratable. Pg207<br />In theory there is no difference between theory and practice; in practice, there is. - Yogi Berra pg213<br />Traders trade -> traders figure out techniques and products -> academic economists find formulas and claim traders are using them -> new traders believe academics -> blowups (Theory induced fragility) pg220<br />Much of what other people know isn't worth knowing. Pg248<br />The most severe mistake made in life is to mistake the unintelligible for the unintelligent - something Nietzsche figured out. In a way, it resembles the turkey problem mistaking what we don't see for the nonexistent, a sibling to mistaking absence of evidence for evidence of absence. Pg249<br />The Procrustean bed in life consists precisely in simplifying the nonlinear and make in it linear - the simplification that distorts. Pg264<br />Someone with a linear payoff needs to be right more than 50% of the time. Someone with a convex payoff, much less. The hidden benefit of antifragility is that you can guess worse than random and still end up outperforming/ Here lies the power of optionality - your function ofsomething is very convex, so you can be wrong and still do fine - the more uncertainty, the better. Pg299<br />Just look at the \\"how to\\" books with, in their title, \\"Ten Steps for...\\"Yet in practice it is the negative that's used by the pros, those selected by evolution; chess grandmasters usually win by not losing; people becoming rich by not going bust (particularly when others do); religions are mostly about interdicts, the learning of life is about what to avoid. You reduce most of your personal risks of accident thanks to a small number of measures. Pg302<br />Negative knowledge is more robust to error than positive knowledge. So knowledge grows by subtraction much more than by addition - given that what we know today might turn out to be wrong but what we know to be wrong cannot turn out to be right, at least not easily. Pg303<br />In political systems, a good mechanism is one that helps remove the bad guy; it's not about what to do or who to put in. For the bad guy can cause more harm than the collective actions of good ones.  Pg304<br />Via negative is part of classical wisdom. Keeping one's distance from an ignorant person is equivalent to keeping company with a wise man. Finally, consider this modernized version in a saying from Steve Jobs \\"People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things as I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things. Pg305dge may warrant.  I will call the philosopher's stone for now, or convexity bias, the result of a mathematical property called Jensen's inequality.

1781162646|5.0|Not like other Stephen King books, still has some supernatural aspect to it, but you will enjoy this book if you like a good mystery.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I played this with my friend and we loved it!!! It is challenging and creative. It makes you. think about what ur looking at. I hope u love it too
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched first season on netflix, they never got the other 2 season, so I was thrilled that I could watch it on Amazon Prime.  Loved this series and was glad to watch each episode and then be able to click on the next one.  I guess now I will have to watch in January from week to week- great series!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are amazing - their music is fantastic and the cello and piano work are gorgeous.  I'm going to buy more of their CD's and would give my eye teeth to see them in concert.
B0064W65SO|4.0|First comic I've ever read. Loved it. Found parts to be confusing but I think that's just because I am not that used to the medium.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|But how I loved it. There were parts that annoyed me. Some language, some small things, but, all in all, it was a great, way too short read. Off to the next one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 10 yr. old granddaughter wanted this game for her tablet. So Grandma jumped in and bought it for her. She spends hours playing this game. In fact she's in my recliner playing it as I type this review. I don't know all that much about the game myself but it keeps her happy and interested. That's good enough for me.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|This game would be better if there were more levels and maybe a few clues to help figure out the harder levels.
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|This seemed to be a complete documentary package with band member interviews, numerous photo's and film/video clips to give the viewer the captivating story of the Eagles. If you want to learn about this band, this is worth buying.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|I was not sure what to expect, but it was pretty good. I enjoyed it very much! I recommend it
0345529057|5.0|This is the best way to get started with the Song of Ice and Fire series. There are two exceptions though. The books are a little smaller than your average size book, and they are all paperback. So people who only like hardback books won't like this set. However, the fact you're getting the first four books, and for the price, you can't go wrong with this box set. Plus, the box the books come in has some nice photos of Ned Stark and Daenerys from the HBO series. The whole thing looks nice on a bookshelf.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Once you get past  the dialect of the book it is great fun to read for all ages of people.
0060254920|5.0|\\"Where The Wild Things Are\\" inspires more of a love/hate relationship with children (and adults) than pretty much any other children's book I know of. Either you loved it as a kid because of the bedroom changing into a forest, and Max taming the wild things to become their king, and Max's dinner still being hot when he returned from his adventure; or you just never got past the scary wild things and hated the book. Obviously, I loved it, and perhaps because my son has had a great big dog's face in his face pretty much since the day he came home from the hospital, the wild things do not scare him at all. In fact, he thinks they are funny.<br /><br />Once, when I entertained art ambitions, I thought it would be great to apprentice with Maurice Sendak, especially when I saw his ballet sets. Sigh, those days are past, but I still love slipping into his world and this book is my passport.
B004SEUJ82|4.0|I liked the way it hooked you in and made you wonder what would happen.  The surprise ending was also very good.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Gidion and Eva can't end like that love the first three books when is the forth book coming out. PLEASE don't end it like that.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|really awesome game and it keeps me active.<br />I even play it when I'm mad.<br />everyone who reads this should really get the game.
B005HV6Y84|4.0|I boought it to get  the Christina perry song for my girlfriend as she loves it.  we found it had several other songs that were pretty good too.  It is an OK CD
B000SEI230|5.0|Perfect summer afternoon read! I love this book, along with all of Nicholas Sparks books. Much better than the movie! I wouldn't even suggest watching the movie!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was a great book. I love this series so much It would be awesome if  the author could right more of these books fast even though I'm one book behind. I would recommend this book if they loved the Percy Jackson series .
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|We bought this season since we couldn't find every episode online and it wasn't on Netflix yet.  This is a show that even our kids can watch and enjoy.  I am glad I bought the season on disc because it is so much more enjoyable to watch it in HD as opposed to streaming.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Just deleted this app .. hate the changes. Lost my previous settings, plus extra keys for other advertising and other apps.
B003719GGS|5.0|this is a great book if you are trying to figure out what you are doing wrong in your relationship with your wife.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|One of the greatest movies to come out of the 80's with incredible music. Madonna is too awesome in this film. For a Madonna fan, this is a must have!!!

B00A757EFW|2.0|it's hard to move my pac man with my hand but even with the stilus it's difficult . But I will keep practicing
B008DM4OTA|4.0|I bought this for my 2year old daughter who is obsessed with Dr ranj and illnesses in general. I started with the free trial and she was immediately attracted to it. Some of the tasks are very sensitive and tricky for the not so dexterous. For a while she could only do certain parts and ask me to finish it. One task is mucky bugs in gums and you have to select the tooth pick and stab each one before brushing the teeth. It wasn't long before she could do it on her own while I wasn't looking! It's educational and fun throughout. I tired of her pressing for extra purchases in error  and as she enjoyed it so much the cost of the full version was well worth it. Not only does it educate about the ailments it also develops motor skills too. 4 stars only due to how precise you need to be with the movements.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It has been wonderful to be able to look up the weather every morning without having to watch the actually news.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|This is album grows on you.  It's beautifully written and (loosely) tells a story of a man coming to terms with his life after facing death, as this Joshua Homme's personal reflection on his brush with death during surgery (and subsequent stay in the hospital).  There is a lot more emphasis on vocals and piano, but this is still Queens.<br /><br />Many albums start off with a bang and then deliver weak 2nd or 3rd acts.  This album starts off slow and moody and picks up to deliver a satisfying ending.  It truly is a unique experience and one of the few albums that MUST be listened to from start to finish in order to fully appreciate each song.<br /><br />I like all of the songs on this album, but my top three are:<br /><br />Kalopsia<br />Fairweather Friends<br />I Appear Missing<br /><br />Josh Homme said this was Act 2 to Queens, and I'm excited to see and hear more.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a great mind game.  It keeps me busy for hours. No glitches to worry about.  Great app.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is easier than some similar ones, which is great for a beginner like me. I reccomend it to start with if you cant figure out escape games.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Connelly writes with realism.  This is the first book of his I've read but plan to read more.  There's no question in my mind that something like this could happen given our involvement in the world and what we are experiencing here at home.  This could have been set in any of our large cities and most particularily in Chicago with it's violance and out of control government.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I couldn't put it down. I spent a lot of time thinking about the what ifs in life. What if I have been a parent to either of these boys. Great easy read thinking novel.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I've only just started watching the series, but the episodes I've seen so far have kept my interest. I hope the whole series holds up as well.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was somewhat tricky to figure out how to play with no instructions.  Once I got it though, I progressed quickly.  I like it!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|The ending was worth the wait. The story and battles were realistic and well within the story line. It was truly epic!
B0037KMHRY|5.0|If you have a cool sound system this soundtrack rocks! I would recommend to any fan of the movie. Enjoy!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|We had seen the movie before but just did not remember the name. We rented it in prep for Red 2.
1476735115|5.0|Wow,  What a great book.  Fun to read.  Good for all ages.  Inspirational, and full of wisdom, as well as imagination and vastness, all contained in a silo...So much more to say read it for yourself, you will want more when you finish this volume.
B005HSL626|2.0|Got this for my kids to play. Too many ads. Worth the dollar for the other version, so I don't have to worry about the kids viewing something they don't need to see.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is tricky and fun. very worth the play. makes your brain work and I would recommend for anyone.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Hard to follow in first few pages, but well worth the time.  Liked it so well, I purchased the second two out of the series.
0449000729|5.0|Rutherfurd has captured my attention for a variety of reasons.  As in The Forest, London, etc., begins at the dawn of the culture.  In Sarum 4000 BC I think.  He style is stunning and I was reluctant to finish.  On to another of his again.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Trip Advisor is an excellent resource that has been 98% correct for me.  I highly recommended it for frequent travelers.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I loved this book. I just finished it and I'm sad it's over. I'll miss the characters but I think I'll find myself rereading this book every year.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 cemented the deal,  I am hooked on Downton Abbey.  I started season 3 and can't get enough of it.  I just love this series!!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|If you are looking for a book that explains or dwells on sniping this is not it.  I realize this was an autobiography, but he didn' t get into the first snipe until 40 percent of the book was completed.  The occasional comments by his wife added nothing to the book
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I haven't even finished this game yet but it is awesome and if you played nova before and like it because of some it's maps it's got the same on here
1616550414|5.0|Got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. Even wants to put it in a glass case.
B003HARV4S|5.0|This is one of the movies that once you start watching it, you just can't stop.  I don't want to give anything away, so I will just say that it is a very good movie with interesting twists and turns.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It took a cheat for me to figure out the first level, but once I did, it was fun. I'd love to see a tutorial at the beginning.
B000L212HC|5.0|This movie is intriguing.  It keeps you wanting to know what will happen next.  Interesting view on the competition between magicians.
B00CD99QWY|5.0|Even though this story is an old one it still has relevance today.  Well written and thought provoking moral issues.  It is considered a classic as it should be.  Used to be required reading for many that seems to have discarded in favor or less meaty modern fare.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|A great movie. Several of the actors play multiple rolls throughout the film. In costume and makeup, it is sometimes tough to recognize them. The acting is quite good. I felt Holly Berry was the weakest of the crew. Many excellent vignette performances. Whether you accept the premise of reincarnation, or not, this movie will make you stop and think about the actions we take in our lives can impact those around us and those who come after us. At just over two hours, it is worth the time  you will invest. I have watched it once, but will definitely watch it again.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|A straight on look at American history from the Native American point to view.  This is book that everyone should read.
B003ELKNH2|4.0|A good classic movie and good rendition of the Vietnam war....excuse me....I mean 'police action'.  It can be a little boring and slow at times, but all in all keeps you interested in what's happening.
B005VPRETE|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who is 8. She loved it and now we are moving up the Lego stamina to Olivia's house.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love world war 2 guns and this app displays them perfectly if your into weapons from world war 2 I highly recommend this app when they update it please add the PPSh 41 I love that gun
0425263924|4.0|Hot and steamy book, although I wish it had more of a storyline. Loves the characters, but Eva's constant back and forth internal monologue gets repetitive.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|So disappointed. Sylvia Day is really stretching out too far from the plot. So whats going to be in book 4, Angus or Clancy's love story?
0061950726|4.0|This was a topic in history I was not familiar with. It was very interesting, although I wish there had been &#34;more&#34; in the end. I felt a little jilted, like I didn't get a satisfactory ending for the characters. Was left hanging?
B0058VW36U|5.0|Love this game. Each level is a new challenge without being frustrating. Plus there are little bonus surprises as you play.
B00866JL96|5.0|This is one of the best love stories I have seen.  I cried, laughed, and was very happy with the ending.  You won't regret buying this movie
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is fantastic! I could not stop playing!!! It is a true mind teaser and it is very fun to play. It draws you in so you can not stop playing!
B0082Z1CVQ|3.0|I feel like I should get an award for finishing this book because I usually give up on overly corny stories.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Try it ! It's the best thing ever that I got in the app store<br />It has power ups,coins and upgrades and lots of other things to do!
0062238868|4.0|That Kyle got killed by someone he was trying to help here at home after all the stuff he went through sniping for our country in foreign lands. I loved the storyline in this book and liked the down home &#34;aw shucks&#34; I was just lucky style that Kyle exhibited here.
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|El Dorado is on of John Wayne's most memorable westerns. Lots of action. It featured several young actors who went on to expand their careers.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome this game was really fun and challenging for me and my mom but it was worth it and i would recommend this to my friends for them to play at home with their family
B00285K1KE|5.0|Great price for the movie brand new still in package. Love the marvel movies just oder the second part, the incredible hulk.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I like this album because if you know Black Sabbath they have a little of the music from their younger years. But not enough to change it for the generation now.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game has done what few other have done...left me wanting more. I played the 10 levels and was quite disappointed that it was over. I want more levels! I want more challenges! I am addicted to this game!<br /><br />Developer, you have done an amazing job creating this game, and I applaud you.<br />The challenges are difficult but not impossible and there is not just one \\"right answer\\" way to do it (some things follow others, but generally there are multiple groups of things that need to be done, and those don't have to be done in a set order). I played a similar game where you had to get certain items and complete things in order A, B, C, D, E...and if you got everything but did it in order A, C, B, D, E, you didn't get counted as having passed the level! That game got deleted pretty quickly after that, and I'm glad this game doesn't fall into that trap.<br /><br />Excellent game. 5+ stars.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Every song sounded great on the CD. They sounded great and Jason beat the rounds just like his dad John and kept perfect rhythm. Best purchase I made on Amazon. Even though I had to order 2 of them. I sold it to a friend and got my money back.
B0058VW36U|3.0|My grandson asked me to buy this game for him. I'm sure he'll have no problem advancing through the levels, but I keep getting the a message to \\"release the super powers of ohm\\". Really?  I have to keep paying to keep playing this game?
1476715904|2.0|couldnt finish this book..dont know why it didnt capture my attention. i had both books in series and didnt finish either.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really love this game,  a n d was disappointed to ring out there were only 10 levels.  The puzzles require some thought, but are relatively easy to sol v e.  Each puzzle has several steps that are required  in order to solve each one.  I can't wait for the new levels!,
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It kept me wondering where the story would go from start to finish. As you will find out don't underestimate overestimate human beings.
B001QWBM62|5.0|This device provides high quality digital recordings through either the internal or externally-connected microphones.  It's a bit bulky compared to some other handheld recorders available these days and the display is a bit old-fashioned looking, but it's got all the capabilities I wanted and works great.<br /><br />Part of the reason for the bulk has to be the ability to accept both XLR and quarter-inch connector plugs for external mics, so that's understandable and a major advantage if working in a musical environment; especially given that these can be used separately or in conjunction with the internal mics.  Other plusses for this device were its ability to do either WAV or MP3 recording, the included AC adapter and other essential accessories (as well as Cubase recording software), etc.  I've been very pleased with this device.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Storylines and acting are superb. Too bad I had to buy season 3 instead of watching On Demand on comcast
B00AF7Z44K|5.0|I absolutely love this series about a young Arthur and a young Merlin.  Very clever and entertaining.  A great take on the old legend.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|i love this app it is surprisingly fun. This game is money well spent. you get to evolve your disease<br /><br />heart grace n. hi anyone who owns a kindle kaeliana sara erin
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I wish this series could have gone on forever.  One of the best Arthur legend adaptations I've ever seen.  I love the interaction between the young Arthur and the young Merlin.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is awesome they give you what you need so you don't have to spend money and it is a good game all around
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great for both kids and adults. Great story, very well made! I'm not a huge movie guy, but I definitely recommend it!
B004S5C91Q|5.0|Such an intriguing perspective from which to write a book. There were a few heart pounding moments but mostly amazement at the acceptance and bond between a mother and son.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|this game is so much fun and tricky. It's also a great game for kids I  have been playing this game for a long time and l bet you will have as much fun as l have had witch is a lot of fun(:
B007ZXK08C|5.0|The pace just didn't quit with this book. Be prepared not to get anything else done once you pick it up.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Skyfall is darker than previous Bond films. Overall, it has a pretty good story line, although there are one or two suspensions of reality, and quite a few fun special effects. Good acting. Sex scenes are pretty much left to the imagination, which is just fine.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I couldn't put it down and can't stop reading the series!! However the plot towards the end made me very upset.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This game is great but you need to make frontiers for Amazon is killing to not have it! Please make it
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Well planned with great graphics. There were no glitches during play. The hints are helpful when needed with no &quot;stuck&quot; places where you can't figure out how to proceed.
B009ZQJVAK|4.0|Great Movie, as most con not go and see the play in NYC right now and great to have the British influence for it
B009XIXVU6|3.0|A touching story of family and missing pieces, but not as poignant as Hosseini's previous works. Well written with deep and relatable characters (although some seemed somewhat superfluous), this book is worth the time spent reading.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I seem to be enjoying the game play though it seems to be somewhat redundant..Same 2 rooms for ever,it felt like..instructions are little confusing..in fact I'm entirely sure I understand what I'm doing...but it's a good distraction...
0316113506|5.0|Some theories regarding the brain functions were very well presented and easy to understand for people who know little about the brain and the cause of the brain's dysfunctions. I recommend it to my clients who come suffering from depression and anxiety and have brain conditioning with us. It helps to understand the process and why the good results.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|Loved it in syndication as a kid; love it even more today. And now my kids get to enjoy it too!<br /><br />Now, to pick up Hogan's Heroes!
B00873GRU4|5.0|Loved reading this, kept me reading for several hours around a tropical pool in Fiji. I read Wool as an ebook, while fellow vacationers across the pool had the paperback editions of the Triology. We all await the third.
B004EI924E|5.0|Wow - an all star cast and some memorable funny moments.  great to see toronto camouflaged as chicago but the story is unique and an absolute hit!
B0015HOFZI|5.0|As with most of all the Sony products I have owned, this one is top notch. Great sound quality, good looking, low profile fits cabinet easy
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Unique and original series.  the cast is excellent and the writing worthy of an award.  hooked after the first two episodes!
B003F3PMYI|4.0|I enjoyed Achor's book and while much of what Achor discusses it isn't revolutionary thinking. I've been a long believer in Sean Covey's 7 Habits and I found many of the 7 habits in Achor's 7 principles of positivity. I do think that Anchor takes a slightly different approach and packages the principles slightly differently.  I highlighted many parts while I was reading and at the conclusion of the book I realized that I'll likely go back and review much of what I highlighted because it is quite a bit of information to digest and ultimately put in to practice without re-reading sections or whole chapters. I look forward to putting these principles in to action in conjunction with Covey's 7 habits and I'd recommend this book to others.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|What an interesting series...filmed in toronto and pretending to be nyc.  only the natives recognize local sights and buildings.  writing is excellent and acting is great.  gabriel macht is a loveable douchebag well paid lawyer.  he grows on you and his new side kick slash apprentice steals the show!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Excellent description of the differences between German Air force and the US.  Really enjoyed seeing how the two men's lives continued on after the drama of WWII.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|a very original series... can't recall anything like it in all my years of watching hollyrock.  great views of nyc and matt bomer is exceptional as an art thief!
1590171993|5.0|I had never heard of the American author and academic John E. Williams and this book, till I caught Ian McEwan urgently praising it on BBC Radio 4,(yes, I'm from over the pond) in such forceful, impassioned terms that I instantly downloaded it.<br /><br />And now I too am forceful and urgent about this beautiful book, and amazed it had vanished for consciousness. Originally published in the 60s, it has resurfaced thanks to the person or persons who have pushed this book back into the public arena, so that awareness of this gem is going viral.<br /><br />As others have said, it is the story of a life where nothing really major happens - except of course that to each of us our own life is major, and its ordinary events - births, deaths and all that lies between, profound.<br /><br />The story of the eponymous William Stoner, born into a farming family in the tail end of the nineteenth century, follows the dramatic trajectory of the twentieth in a tiny way, playing no part in the theatres of war, the great depression, another war. What happens in his life is that he has a moment of awakening into meaning through literature, falls in love, marries, has a child, becomes a teacher through the love he found in art, and things go badly or well, friendships and enmities transpire, love is lost and found, in different guises, minds and hearts connect, or don't, and death will always come.<br /><br />It's a life of nothing and of everything. But it is the spare, unfussy writing, the careful opening of the human heart, the simple depth which the writer reveals which lifts this book into something extraordinary<br /><br />It reminds me, most of all of the last lines of Keats' Ode on A Grecian Urn' - that sense of the beauty, simplicity and depth when what is fussy and extraneous is cut away, so the lines of a life can be seen, and the enormity of even a small life comes clear.<br /><br />'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,--that is all<br />Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.'<br /><br />As in this small life, we are shown, time and again, how any one of us has moments when we blaze out of existence into LIFE. And the moments when this happens are not by any means the moments of high ecstasy or anguished drama. As in Stoner's first epiphany, it can happen in the mere reading of a sonnet - 'What is the sonnet's meaning?', asks his irascible tutor of the stolid young man Stoner is at that point - `It means' `It means' is the response, and his life opens on that moment<br /><br />Here is an example of the clean simplicity of the writing, and the reflective depth which it reveals:<br /><br />In his extreme youth Stoner had thought of love as an absolute state of being.............in his maturity he had decided it was the heaven of a false religion...........Now in his middle age he began to know that it was neither a state of grace nor an illusion; he saw it as a human act of becoming, a condition that was invented and modified moment by moment and day by day, by the will and the intelligence and the heart.'<br /><br />As in this small life, we are shown, time and again, how any one of us has moments when we blaze out of existence into LIFE.

B00C7L4QB4|2.0|Production value and cast decent, yet terribly flat series.  I was never in suspense in first 3 episodes; cleaning finger nails, checking phone.  At the closure of each show I had to force myself to click on the next - just to give it a decent try.  Would have been much more compelling if the killers were not revealed and caught within 45 minutes. Fungus Killer? He needs his own season.  Am very surprised at all the 5 star reviews.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Tap, Tilt, Swipe, Tickle ; Now I'm The Big Gun!  Iron Man 3 is fast and fun ; an endless runner injected with Extremis !!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Action packed, great story & very well acted by all involved. The characters were well developed & believable. Hope there is a sequel in the future!
B000LPS4BG|5.0|One of the best gangster movie. Full of accurate fashion and great acting. A must see!!! No regret- pure pleasure
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I started reading the first book and could not stop reading it, therefore I had to get the next book. This also led to purchasing the third one. I could actually visualize each character. These were good reading.
B004499LWQ|5.0|Very romantic, but not in typical Gorky movie way. Great acting from Natalie Portman, she is the girl you would want to be with! When she got hit by the car and Jude is over her, the words she says, - Hello, stranger! You won't forget it!!!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|We all need to be coached to be better - this book gives you the tools in a 2x4 to the face kind of way. Refreshing & valuable!
B001JNNDDI|5.0|One of the best gangster movie. Full of accurate fashion and great acting. Very entertaining all the way to the end!!! Final act is epic!!!!
B003B02OOG|5.0|Grisham is one of the best writers going today. Can not put this book down until the last page. Good reading
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I usually gravitate toward historical fiction, so this book was a little out of my &#34;comfort zone&#34;  but I was so glad I read it! It was a fast read, sometimes funny, other times sad.  The characters in the book are so much more fleshed out and complex than in the movie.  The movie really paled in comparison for me. I think someone who understands football would have even more fun with it (although it is not so think with football references that I found myself bored).
B008Q08IV4|5.0|In your video library? If not, it should be...Love this movie, bought to replace it on vhs.  One I can watch again and again.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I have read both &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;One Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; and loved them both (especially the latter) so I decided to try this latest book by Khaled Hosseini.  If you are craving something &#34;heavy&#34; and moving, read this.  It weaves the lives and generations of the characters in a way that kept me really engaged. It will break your heart at times but I admittedly enjoy the power a book can have over my emotions, and feel it is a wonderful testament to an authors talent.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|It has all been said already really.....first 3 books marvelous, 2nd 2 utter tripe!<br /><br />So many things I don't understand : what the heck is Arya doing in the house of black and white and why is she becoming a face changer and what is that going to mean in the future?  Bran's story is just a mystery to me....roots and people growing in roots?  Stannis has been marching for decades it would seem - I thought Winterfell was pretty close to the wall, seems I was wrong.  Victarion has been sailing forever and he still hasn't reached Meereen - Tyrion, please someone tell him where whores go, left after Victarion and got to Meereen first!  Long enough to be sold into slavery and abandon his slavers and become a sell sword and Victarion, the great sailor, is messing about smashing up ships and burning people!  And killing off Jon Snow??  Unless of course the Melisande brings him back to life......and he joins the other zombies; there are so many of them now.....<br /><br />I'm glad that Varys is back because without him the whole of King's Landing was dull and duller!  Perhaps we can get back to plotting and scheming.  Tyrion was a great character, please let him meet Dany and help her get back to Westeros and perhaps she can tell him where whores go.  Also Dany get your strength back and kill the bloody Harpy please, when did you become so weak?<br /><br />George, I'm going to stick with you for another book but it needs to actually do something, something has to happen, plots must make a return.....if they don't I'm done!!
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|I liked the movie, was good, not what I expectated but still enterntaining. Would recommend to someone to buy movie.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved this  Kindle app for almost 2  years and this mornining they updated it to a shadow of what it had been.  Gone is the ability to sign up for weather alerts, see what the pollen is like,  and generally all the other neat things that it had  last night.  Good bye app.  You're off my Kindle.  I still have the. Old app on my Google TV,  so hopfuly it says the way I liked it.
B005FLX2WC|3.0|Ordered this CD for the song, I'll be There for you.Watched the live version on you tube. So I searched and found the song on the Don't Explain CD. The live version is much better than the studio recorded version.
B004GYY714|5.0|use this app all the time. very convenient. very easy to usE. don't have to go directly to so many different stations all of them are right there where you want them
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is good for a lot of this but to me it is awesome for 2 things which is traveling and when your bored and have exactly nothing to do I love this game and I will like it to till the end
0920668372|5.0|I loved this book when my daughter was little and now I bought it for my grand daughter!!! Love it!!
B00BESM14U|5.0|Story-<br />I really don't go for movies like this one.  Most of this time they tend to be a vehicle for the directors/writers hidden agenda.  Perks of Being a Wallflower, is just a good movie made from a great story.  Every character excepts there flaws, but yet tries desperately to be better then what they are.  So refreshing in a society where young people are constantly told their perfect just the way they are.  Finally a movie for a younger generation that says excepting yourself is not an excuse for not bettering yourself.<br /><br />Acting-<br />Great, that's all that really needs to be said.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love the hourly updates and ease of use. Always comes right up and various displays are very user friendly. Can count on this app.
B008220BLG|5.0|This movie is great!  A somehow romantic zombie movie…  It was fun how we had the zombie's point of view and ultimately were made sympathetic.  I laughed all the way through.  Also, I think every awkward teenage boy can relate to the guy in this movie.  I definitely recommend this!
B0090X4GLW|4.0|My kids have been singing it nonstop for weeks now.  But, we are very disappointed that the Bella's version of ace of base and bulletproof isn't on the soundtrack!  Why not???
B000002KHF|4.0|The only problem that I didn't like, was that the CD case was shattered to pieces when I finally received it. I had to get a new CD case before it was given to its gifted person on Christmas. The packaging was still way to soft for such a fragile item.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|The characters are enjoyably fun and flawed. The story is a good mix of intrigue as well as hilarious funny, cringe worthy comical moments. Great book I look forward to buying the sequels.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game ever because I love the Paris update and I like the Rome update best game ever
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I didn't want to watch this show after watching it for 15 minutes. Then my niece told me to give it a chance and now I am addicted. it is GREAT&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;.LOVE IT&#62; Not for children ! Give it a chance......it gets real good fast. at first you want to shut it off, but no give it a chance, ADDICTED !!!!
0385535147|4.0|Liked this book...a lot of twists & turns.  At times not sure where it was going to go, but I knew that it would be interesting.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|Except for the violence this was a very moral story which was refreshing in today's culture. I love Denzel anyway!
B008VNIA32|2.0|Was expecting a good performance but was very disappointed by the staging. Music was up to expectation but it was hard just to close your eyes at the scenery.  That was yucky and unbelievable.  I feel sorry for the  Performers, Orchestra and the Conductor Daniel Barenbolm.
B0093Q9SCS|4.0|I'm not usually a fan of Hillary Swank. But, I loved her and the entire cast in this movie. Makes me laugh and cry.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Wish the dragons were more interactive. But I still enjoy them. Come join the fun. I really like the variety they've created.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very challenging & fun.  2 areas I would like to see improved. Ability to save your progress on each level. Hints or notes at uper levels levels would be helpful. A game that makes you think outside the box. But when you get stuck you are dead in the water.
B005K17RU0|4.0|The weather indications work well, and the information provided is extensive. However, the image design does not fit well on the 7&#34; Kindle fire format. It requires a lot of screen movement to see needed information.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|A well written, interesting and complex story delving into a world of characters both noble and cruel blended with fantasy, complex family trees, alliances and enemies.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I play Mahjong Deluxe at least once or twice a day! Extremely addictive! Play even while watching television - bye bye commercials.
1451695195|5.0|This book is extremely well written for those seeking to understand there is more to their physical body then this earthly body.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Going into this I was very set on hating the fact that my Queensryche as I had know them from the very beginning had broken up. Even though their music and sound had been on the decline since \\"Promised Land\\" they would always be one of my favorite bands.<br />After listening to Geoff's Queensryche \\"Frequency Unknown\\" released in April, I thought to myself that this is the same crap he's been writing for many years now. With only a few good songs I could add to my own homemade Best of Collection on my I Touch.<br />Then it was June 25th, 2013 and for the first time in over 20 years I was listening to The original band again. Heavy guitars, hard drums, echoing bass licks and a younger sounding Tate at the wheel. Although the CD is short by Queensryche earlier years standards, 2 short instrumentals and everything else less than 4:40 minutes. I played it from start to finish 3 times in a row, loving some songs more than others \\"Warning\\", Rage For Order\\", \\"Empire\\", \\"Promised Land\\" and \\"Operation Mindcrime 1\\" to name a few. Now I'm set to say I like the new Queensryche better, I'll always love the original band and will never forget their awe inspiring early years, setting the trend for what we all now call Heavy Metal.<br />The two bands need to stop fighting over the name in court, Tate should just be that The Geoff Tate Band since he has a few CD's on his own. And the new Queensryche should keep the name... Look it's easy what is better for everyone involved, Tate's Queensryche will not sell as many cd's as the new band will. He needs to let the name go and move forward with his vision without hurting the the new bands chances of getting into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. It's been 30 years now and it is time and we all just want to stop \\"Screaming In Digital\\"...<br />Queensryches, \\"Queensryche\\" Review I enjoyed the hole album, even the not so clean and clear live tracks. My Favorite has to be \\"In this light\\" Heavy but mellow Todd LaTorre vocals are just amazing. So ISay AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME, I can't wait for the next one...
1401937519|5.0|Anita's book sparked a part of me to go beyond my on limited thoughts of who I am and to remember the truth of who I am.  I have a greater understanding of what FEAR does to our physical body and what to focus only on remembering my JOY.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If I were you I would say that  minecraft is pretty  awesome because you can have a lot of fun  in this  one video game and  also have some fun with friends.
B00C2IJJE6|5.0|I put off purchasing Shawshank because it is shown so often on TV. But that usually means I catch it during the movie at some point and rarely see it beginning to end. At ~$10 for the Blu ray disc, I figured it was time to own a copy and be able to enjoy it whenever I want. I am not a huge King fan, but this film version is an unbelievably well done job. From the casting, editing, directing, lighting, writing...it's really phenomenal. I have read that this film is one of the most re-watched of all time, surprising since when it premiered the critics and ratings were just sort of meh.  The Blu ray looks and sounds good, a good transfer to disc job.
B002ZG974W|5.0|This is an adorable film! If you're looking into it trying to find a message or a \\"point,\\" you're going to be disappointed. There is none! It is simply footage of babies doing cute things in different places. Personally, I thought the parents in San Francisco were frustratingly hippie-ish and stereotypical, but other than that it was a very relaxing film that made me feel good. I watched it with my girlfriend and we both loved it, so we showed it to another friend of ours and he loved it too. It's better if you watch it with people and comment on the baby's shenanigans together. A great feel-good film!
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a Great book, not as good as the first but definitely kept me on my toes the whole time :)
B00632HWOG|4.0|I have never used Yahoo before and it is very different from COX, so I am adjusting to the change. My son set this up for me because we have Team-Viewer, and we were having problems using that with COX.  I saw some differences right away, in that I receive much LESS junk mail. YEH!
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Can't miss the beginning as it tells the story of Thor and the Norse Gods. Good visuals and normal good vs. evil plot
B004JK61K0|2.0|My son was trying to set this up for e-mail on my Kindle Fire and he had so many problems with it that he did not go with this. He is a Networking Engineer, contracted with the Gov. and he couldn't set this up, so I KNOW that I would not be able.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|This is just another great release from Blake. There are some future hits on this album. Try to pick which will be the next hit, too many great songs to choose.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|gripping read - can't wait for his next book!  High Recommend this to anyone, whether you're interested in the fantasy genre or not...
B006OCM0G0|3.0|it's a good game but,  it needs a little more to it! like we could name our own restaraunt and pick foods to cook.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book. If you like reading it is an easy book to go through and something you cant put down.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This game is awesome!!! it makes me feel like a real artist!!! I love it!!! there is one bad thing though.... I was typing one thing on google and it spell checked it to something else and that something else was inappropriate, and it pulled up a bunch of pictures of it. they should put restrictions on it so it won't do that.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. If you like reading it is an easy book to go through and something you cant put down.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have been playing Magic The Gathering card game since it first came out. I even played the Windows 95 version. I haven't played with anyone for years. I always wanted to try it on the PS3 but couldn't afford it. I recently received a Kindle Fire for a gift. I tried the free version and was enthralled with it I just had to buy it. On the Kindle Fire it's just like playing Magic The Gathering with a friend.
1433537427|4.0|This bible has amazing study notes,the only thing is that it has very small print so probably most suited to travel, I will be buying the same version with bigger print for use on Sundays/studying.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|Nice and bright. Most of the time kept it on low even with no moon. Nice and light too. Greatfor camping.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Its fun, but not very challenging. As a mom with 2 young kids its nice cuz I can watch them and do puzzles at the same time and not worry about loosing peaces.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I had my doubts about this little gizmo copying my 35mm slides into digital format, but I sure was surprised. The ease with which it performed the operation. Terrific. Get a 16GB or larger SD card for the transfer. I've done about 200 slides already.. Old memories in a new format to enjoy fully...
B003M6FGTE|4.0|This show is very entertaining. Shows the struggles of teenagers and their teacher.<br />The plot is well put together and always keep you to want to see more.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's is fun can't put it down.  I am up for at s time. It's charage to do. Trying to win the first time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|there should be a save option to come back to instead of having to start over every time you sign back on.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great Sci-Fi I actually plan to watch it again. Im really glad I found it - Well filmed and directed.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It is an ok book. Poorly written. Many parts of the book are repeated over and over and over... it gets tiring...I'm not interested in reading the other 2 books... it is not worth it my time.
0345537998|5.0|Sailing a rattletrap ship, Tuf contracts to take a shady group to find the source of mysterious plagues on a ravaged planet. He does, at some danger. His affection for felines leads to symbiosis.<br />A note about this classic: Tuf would never say &#34;shady group&#34;. They would be 'felonious partners', or 'less than honorable fellows'. But he is not wordy or bombastic; many conversations are jewels of deduction. Most important, when presented with temptation, he will confound you. Read to discover how.<br />Accompanied by illustrations of important characters.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Another mesmerising game., .I should be going to sleep, but have become engrossed keep telling myself this is the last level...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun and challenging for all ages. can't wait for new levels to be developed. spent a great morning playing with my grandkids.
B0064SHI9I|4.0|This app works and will transfer pictures,  music, contacts and some apps/data I tried several others that worked on my older phones but for some reason when I used them on the S4 the files could not be read. This was unexpected as the apps I use have always worked fine.  After much research found that this one worked on the S4. I have a problem with some of my songs not playing fully on the new phone  but I don't know if it is the app or the phone ? Wondering if the app only transferred partial songs. I know I can do it with the SD cards but was hoping to avoid having to transfer so much to the computer first then onto the phone.  I was going from the Samsung Stratosphere the new Galaxy S4.  It was very slow to transfer music. The first time it only transferred a few contacts and stopped.  It was easy to use. Plug in the old phone on one USB, the new phone on another USB, and follow the  easy instructions. You can watch as it transfers files.  I gave it 4 stars because for whatever reason it did not install  the first time and it needed to be done 3x and I feel it is overpriced. I don't mind paying for good apps but for $5.00 I expect it to work as well as any free apps  with out any glitches, and I have many good free apps that  work flawlessly the first time.  After repeated tries I finally saw both phones and got things done. Overall this is a good app and one worth having if you have issues with transferring to the Galaxy S4 or if you need data and contacts to transfer between newer phones.

B005OZE9SA|5.0|I write and record my own music.  When I upgraded to a new computer with Windows 8 it wouldn't support my M-Audio Fast Track Pro so I had to upgrade.  The Focusrite Scarlett worked right out of the box.  I replaced the stock cable with a Monster cable and my recordings sound great.  Very easy to use.  Just plug in a microphone or guitar, set your levels, and start rocking.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|he needs to get up at 5 only on Monday - Thursday and I need to get up at 6:30 each workday. this program allows Multi alarms. great free app!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|It was a long wait for this one, but well worth it.  It isn't my favorite QotSA recording but it's still miles above most of the other music out there.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book has all the pieces: likable yet complex characters, good sci-fi storyline, well written in an interesting style.  I just hope they don't ruin it with the movie. I already can't believe they cast Harrison Ford. Really?
B003TH2LYY|5.0|I like the show a lot.  I like Castle's personality as portrayed by Nathan Fillion(Just in a cracked.com video and Firefly).<br /><br />If you like &#34;Who done it&#34; shows, then you'll probably like this one.  There are elements of the show to relate with just about everyone.  It's lighthearted and funny, sometimes it's dark and serious.  There is a good balance in the show of that.<br /><br />It follows a writer who is doing research for his next book.  You learn a lot about Castle and the people around him on the way. I believe all the secondary characters are interesting and I think I'm a harsh critic.<br /><br />It's currently lined up for its' 6th season, I'm excited.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|Since its been a while since this was on the air, it has been nice to go back and re-watch the opening season.  One of the first series I have been watching from Amazon Instant Video and the quality of the picture and sound has been great.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|my four year old loves this game...she can spend so much time on it.<br />she puts on the make up and enjoys dressing the girl and picking all the accessories to go with it....it sure is sooo girly
B008CPZNL6|1.0|I have this app on my phone and I love it and use it all the time.  However, on my Kindle Fire, it is worthless.  I can't even log in to my account.  It just keeps &quot;attempting to load&quot;.  I finally had to remove it from my device.
B0091REZMW|5.0|while it does take a while for the energy and diamonds to build back up this game is definitely addicting
B0088O11NU|4.0|It was really fun, but I was left wanting more after I finished the game. my name is bob. Bye!
1451695195|5.0|I found this very interesting especially since I am familiar with the places mentioned.  He also explained medical terms so I could understand them.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this book can't wait until the next one comes out. Sylvia keeps you wanting more. Sylvia Day is a great writer.
B000BO0QHW|5.0|The Very Best of Norman Brown, is a must have! He is very, very gifted. I use this CD in my &#34;cruiser&#34;, along with all Euge Groove CD's....sweet!
B003UESJHO|4.0|This is not a great movie, but it's not completely bad either.  The movie is kind of slow at first then it picks up momentum.  I enjoyed watching this and think anyone will like it as well.
B00821OX98|5.0|Both video and audio quality was great. Really enjoyed catching up on some missed episodes. So now the question is do we trust the skitters?
B000P12LWY|5.0|This series will get you hooked!  Get ready to purchase each and every one made after this first season.  The characters and costumes are breath-taking!!
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Picture quality was great it streamed well. The audio quality on the other hand was less than stellar. The only way I know how to describe it is jumpy.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|This is not a great movie, but it's not completely bad either.  The movie is kind of slow at first then it picks up momentum.  I enjoyed watching this and think anyone will like it as well.
B0000X2DMA|4.0|I like this group.  They give me my metal fix and they aren't the kind of group you can get sick of hearing after a couple repeats of a few songs.  They write in a way that sounds fresh each time you listen to it; that's what I like about a group.  This album kind of sounds like a soundtrack to a movie or play though not Phantom of the Opera though; that's Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's work.  I would suggest this to someone who's looking for a metal fix plus fresh sound each time.
B001U6YI92|5.0|I Love it...It's a classic and a Must -Have for any Clint Eastwood fan. The story is great and of course it is action packed, I enjoy watching this over and over again!
B000007ODM|5.0|A friend had told me about this group and sent me a link; I got hooked right away.  I figured I would buy an album to have a copy of this great music.  Sure I don't understand what they're singing, but I just love the mellowness about the music.  It's mellow and invigorating depending on the song.  I would recommend this for anyone who likes New Age music.
B001EO748M|5.0|I love the acting, the characters are just fantastic!!  They keep me interested and wanting to know what happens next.  I love the costumes, the colors are brilliant!!
B0050DIWFC|2.0|It was a difficult read for me; little was positive.  It's a difficult world out there, I know that, but this was not a good book for me.  Sorry.  I regret spending the money...
B002ZG997M|5.0|You may watch this over and over again.  I loved the acting and the surprise twist, it's a wonderfully acted and interesting movie and I highly recommend it!
B00006J9OT|5.0|Diana Krall's Live in Paris is my first Jazz album, and I love it.  I came across the recommendation for this album on an audiophile website, and I have to agree, the recording sounds awesome!
B0041KKYDI|4.0|This is not a great movie, but it's not completely bad either.  The movie is kind of slow at first then it picks up momentum.  I enjoyed watching this and think anyone will like it as well.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I just finished reading Jill Sanders Finding Pride and found it a wonderful sexy suspense romance that I couldn't put down.<br />She draws you in so that you just have to finish it in one night. Housework suffers and husband goes hungry but all worth it because you get to read a great story.<br />Good job Ms Sanders.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|This is not a great movie, but it's not completely bad either.  The movie is kind of slow at first then it picks up momentum.  I enjoyed watching this and think anyone will like it as well.
B005LAJ16I|3.0|The first 2-3 episodes of Homeland were some of the most addictively suspenseful storytelling television has ever done. Unfortunately the series went downhill fast from there. Where else the writers could have gone I am not sure, but what I do know is their choices took matters in the wrong direction. The acting in Homeland was superb, with some deft performances by professionals at the peak of their craft. Likewise the locations really looked like Iraq reduced to a war zone. Even the inner workings of the intelligence community were convincing. What went wrong was not about Homeland's visuals or cast, blame lies in its resolution, which squandered the brilliance of the show's beginning. The climax of season one was not only all wrong in terms of what we wanted to see unfold, but it mandated a degree of credulity that was almost insulting. I have not seen the second season of this series and am not certain I will. During the first two episodes had someone told me that would be the case, I don't think I would have believed it. There is much that I could criticize in specific terms but I don't want to spoil anyone's viewing experience by giving the plot away. Suffice to say I did not hate Homeland, but I was let down, and I'll leave it at that.
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|This is not a great movie, but it's not completely bad either.  The movie is kind of slow at first then it picks up momentum.  I enjoyed watching this and think anyone will like it as well.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|There is a twist to the story line that I wasn't expecting but it all worked out in the end.
1401307787|5.0|The guidance in the book is wonderfully expressed.  The guidance was clear, and it helped me to get in touch with relaxing and calming my life down.  This is a great book and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to get in better touch inwardly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an awesome app. I highly recommend it to anyone because it isn't too hard or too easy! Some parts may be a bit difficult, but in the end, it's all about thinking.
B00CNEVHMG|4.0|After listening to this disc I can see that Hoffman was going for the same results that he got with Close To The Edge. He removed the hard, raspy brightness that prevailed on this recording. The album is easier on the ears this way. As I said before, they produced this without the expertise of Eddy Offord. It is over compressed. However, so was the LP (I had the Jap import LP). I feel that this is the best that will ever come from this album short of remixing it. Listen to Tormato. It sounds just as bad and again the band thought that they could produce that one themselves too.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Loved it from the start !  Great graphics and play. Couldn't stop playing so lost a lot of sleep time. Look forward to the next big fish game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game I just wish there were more levels, at the moment there are only nine. But totally worth trying out.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Although I think the book could have been edited down - i really liked it. The combination of a &#34;bad&#34; hero, philosophy and the setting in India made for a different plot. One of my favoriate characters was Indian - he made me laugh out loud. The main character reflects on life and life's lessons that make you contemplate your life and yet it's nonstop action - with badguys and the slum  and other x-pats who all have secrets.
0345529057|4.0|I found first volume a bit difficult to get into at first, but once there the stories held me and I couldn't wait to open the next book.  The characters are vividly written and buying the series is a must.  No more do you have to wait until you can get your hands on Volume 2 or 3 or, etc.  This set is a keeper. Can't wait for future books.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was written with a little different style, and for the story of the book it worked.  Overall it was OK, ended up watching the movie afterwards and I think I liked the movie better.
B0094K1K42|3.0|I live in a small town and have seen and heard 'the one's that come back' for a visit speak the way the Charlize charactor did.  To me she wasn't happy where she was in her life so how could anyone be 'happy' to be where she came from.  Anyway it seems to be a common thought process whether someone carries it as far as she does...I'm just glad she figured something out and didn't stick around town as a drunk to keep hometown people stirred up.  I know someone that treats their tiny dog like that , just another 'thing' to have or own.  The movie-storyline and acting was put together very well....worth watching.
1452113432|5.0|Love this cookbook !  Fun, creative approach to French cooking & proper techniques. I'm going to feature a few recipes in the Fall Cooking class I teach.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This thing charges my SG4 quickly and reliably. The unit has overall good build quality/. Nothing much more to discuss - it's solid.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game, my kids love it! Almost like taking care of a real horse. It gives them a sense of how much work it is.
1592402690|5.0|Dispels the mythology of the Beatles by simply writing about what took place in the studios. They worked hard, played hard, and broke the conventions. Geoff Emerick was the perfect studio engineer for them, because he broke away from recording conventions and experimented. An excellent read for anybody interested in recording and familiar with the Beatles catalogue.
B00BKBCF38|4.0|I'm not much of a Ghost fan, I seen them for the first time when they were touring with Opeth and Mastadon. I never heard of them until that night. I was completely sold by their performance and overall of everything about them. I did purchase this just to check it out. Out of the whole CD i only ended up liking 3 songs out of it.
B00AM7E4LM|5.0|Is there a skill that you would like to acquire? Is there something that you really want to learn?<br /><br />Then stop talking about it, stop reading about it, stop thinking about it and start practicing. It is the only way how you can end up with a new skill under your belt.<br /><br />The one thing that I like about Josh's book is that he makes very clear that the fastest way how to acquire a new skill is by practicing. It doesn't matter how much you know about something if you don't put into practice. He makes a clear distinction between skill acquisition, learning, training and education so one can really understand what those concepts mean, because many people use them as synonyms.<br /><br />The power of this book is in its simplicity. Author doesn't use many words to say what he wants to say and I like that. He goes right to the point showing you how can you learn fast. He shows you the principles of rapid skill acquisition and rapid learning and off you go to learn something new.<br /><br />The principles are simple, a common sense that so many people have a hard time to apply. As Josh says: rapid skill acquisition is not a rocket science. It is easy to understand, you just need to apply principles into action.<br /><br />I also like the chapters where author talks about his own learning journey. These examples really help you understand how can you go from theory into action. Even though I have no interest in learning how to play Go or how to windsurf, the lessons that you can draw from it are priceless.<br /><br />As a long time guitar player and guitar teacher I really like the way Josh deconstructed how to play ukulele. I would recommend this chapter to anybody who wants to learn a musical instrument. The insights that you can find there are very practical and useful. (As a matter of fact I started to learn piano after reading this book.)<br /><br />The most valuable thing about this book is that it made me eager to learn new things, the things that I put off for such a long time. It has changed my life because it made me realize that I can learn anything.  And it doesn't have to take a lifetime.<br /><br />Great book.
0783225482|5.0|I remember watching this as a kid, now my kid loves this movie. Absolutely hilarious. I love it. Goldie Hawn was obsolutely beautiful same with. M.Steep. And OMG Bruce Willis has hair!
B008133MDK|5.0|I love watching BBC shows and Sherlock is definitely a hit.  I can't wait for the next season.  It is funny and suspenseful with great plot twists.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|This was supposed to provide a free digital download copy with the hard copy, but even though I have a recent computer and am well within the deadline, the download is not working. I think Flixster is a waste of time, and the &#34;UltraViolet Cloud&#34; viewer is a waste of time -- small and not good quality.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great game to pass the time with. My husband and I like to play this game together.
B0018OFN1S|3.0|I started watching these movies at the 4th or 5th installment so I decided to watch the first. It was a decent movie and explains the dynamic of some of the current crew.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I saw this film in the theater and walked out and immediately bought the books.  I say this is a success is a movie can make you want to read the source material.  I thought the trailer for City of Bones looked good enough to read those books too.  This equals a win in my eyes.
0634022296|5.0|Listed as number 1 in the 50 greatest Guitar Books, for good reason. I have been been able to use it for clarification on a number of songs.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Most of the time there is a song or two that are not really good. Not true with this CD, My Eyes is my favorite.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great game, lots of different layouts to try and timed games so that you can try and beat your record. Brilliant!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Was very disappointed when I couldn't find any Garth Brooks on iTunes, took a chance on here and found this killer deal! CD case was slightly scratched upon arrival, but 11 dollars for 40 some songs is well worth it and the CD playa flawlessly
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun and very addictive!!! I love taking care of the horse!  You get to feed groom and play with your horse
B00000JMOF|3.0|As an adult, I viewed the movie and had to laugh considering all the changes made from Mary Shelley's orginal novel.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|We started watching this show on TV and missed all of season 2 and 3 except the last show of 3. I am soo happy Amazon had it in a bundle pack, I don't usually purchase movies but this one is a must have. We are hooked and looking forward to season 4.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I received the dvd in a timely fashion but have not had time to view the movie with my son.  I presume it works well.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I can't put this book down!!  I've been watching the series on television which has been a bit confusing at times.  The book has been clearing up the confusion and I can't remember the last time I read a book that was so good.
B00DM0XXCM|2.0|Movie felt hurried and missing a real plot. Poor character developement. Every action sceen was cut short and left us wondering how they got out of the scenario. Movie could have had potential with more time, character developement, finishing action scenes and a better budget.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This movie has some of the best 3D animations I've ever seen.  The character quality is outstanding. The story line is easy to follow and leaves you wanting more at the end.  I think there should be a follow-up for this one.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is one of my favorite book series and I couldn't put it down from start to finish. Gideon and Eva are one of my favorite book couples. I cannot wait for the release of the next books in this series.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I have all the other Twilight  DVD's so I wanted this one to complete the set. Good quality and nice.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book since I'd never read anything by Colleen Hoover before, but I absolutely loved this book! Not what I expected, but in a very good way! I can't wait to read the next book!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a pretty nifty little calculator for FREE.  The calculator has all the functionality you need for a high end calculator.<br /> Best of all, again it's free!  ;)<br />Totally RECOMMENDED!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great thinking game, only problem is that I blew threw thew levels too quickly...now I have to wait for the updates!
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|This was my second Nesbo \\"Harry Hole\\" story, and I was blown away. A truly fantastic story that you don't want to stop reading. The different plot twists will keep you guessing who the antagonist really is. I will, with no doubt in my mind, read the other \\"Harry Hole\\" novels.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|Too vanilla and sugary. Not much of a sappy love story kind of girl and only watched it to appease a family member.
B00A6HHJ9C|4.0|Lukather continues to impress with his guitar and writing chops. He can burn, but never seems to overplay. I am a loyal fan and will continue to follow and support him.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|The only thing that would make it better is if Jackie Chan was singing instead of Donny Osmond. Although, Donny does a decent job.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|My wife and I watched this movie after being somewhat excited for it. It was disappointing in almost every area. The \\"special\\" effects were so poorly done they took us out of the movie. It seemed like most of the actors (I'm looking at you James Franco, Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz) were phoning it in for the whole movie. Honestly Zach Braff as the flying monkey had the most emotion and realism to his role (if his animated body was only better). The best thing I can say about this movie is that, for the most part, it sets up \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" pretty well.<br />Overall, I recommend just watching \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" again or read the books, they are phenomenal!
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book was excellent! I could not put it down and finished it within 24 hours of my purchase. I have been to many areas in and around that Ms. Strayed wrote of, her descriptions took me right back there again. I must plan a hiking trip to the Pacific Crest soon! Ms. Strayed's writing is truly a wonderful gift to those who take the opportunity to experience it!
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|The pics on the site and reviews suckered me into trying this. I am sorry I did. All you do is walk around and try to find flyers on the trees or buildings. The controls are bad...walking is difficult, I don't know how to run, and visibility is poor.
0312853254|4.0|Compared to the first book in the series, [[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1) (The Ender Quintet)]], SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD is quite a bit different--a lot deeper sociologically, anthropologically, culturally, psychologically, and, uh, xenologically.<br /><br />The story has lasting emotional impact, but not quite the raw emotion in ENDER'S GAME. The twists are also not nearly as devastating and ironic, and it took me a few chapters to really get hooked--but it's still an excellent book. It raises a ton of interesting questions, especially in regards to how we view and interact with other societies and other species, while developing rich and complex characters and a huge web of lies. Highly recommended.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It is challenging and somewhat fun. However, some of the puzzles, to me, don't make too much sense. Maybe a help button or a hint button...just not for me. If you have no idea what to do or where to go, you are stuck.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The highest compliment I can give this book is that I downloaded the first story on the way to a vacation destination and by the end of the week, I'd worked my way through all the stories of Wool and began the sequel.<br /><br />While I found the writing adequate and sometimes clunky. Howey has a well-thought out view of the world he has created but more importantly, he structures his story in a completely different - and enjoyable - way.<br /><br />This may stem from the fact that Wool I was a stand-alone short story that Howey built on after receiving plenty of fan mail. However, even then we are treated to episodes of different character's lives. It's not the interlocking, sweeping narrative of the novel. It's not a series of short-stories. To me, it's something new. It's something enjoyable and, I believe, only something that could be allowed in the world of the self-publisher and the ebook.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Loved it! This is a great modern update to the Edgar Rice Burroughs classic barsoom book series . Sequel please!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|this is a great, addicting game that offers hours of fun, with many different difficulties and challenges. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves strategy games.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed 100% every part of this movie.<br />The characters were well put together and it seemed to be really based on real-life situations that could possibly happen.<br />Both of the characters were practical and full of emotion.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Definitely one of the best in the series. The strong alpha that was totally over the top in love with the heroine made  this one of my favorites. The history an bond between them was awesome!
B001NLF2ZI|5.0|This is one of Nicole Kidman's best movies.  Her emotions were so believable that you could really get into the character.  Sean Penn has come a long way from his bad boy era and I really liked watching him in his scenes.  The story line is very timely as to what is happening in the third world countries.  The last time that I saw it on TV, some of the parts had been out to allow for more commercials so I had to buy it so as not to miss a thing.  Every time that I watch it, I pick up something new.  This is a keeper.
6305079811|5.0|This has got to be the best movie ever.  I remember watching this over and over when it came out on cable.  Decided to get it and introduce my son to this kitschy movie with the, at the time, super modern special effects!  It is a classic and the soundtrack rocks and brings the movie to life!
0131480057|5.0|I'm not a computer professional; I'm just a hobbyist.  Although, I just got out of the Marine corps and I will be majoring in ComputerScience when I start college this fall (2013)...  I've been using openSUSE since about 2005; when I got on an anti-microsoft kick because I began to feel that the &#34;bugs&#34; and mal-ware in windows were all done on purpose for &#34;job-security.&#34;<br />I've never done a whole lot in the CLI because I'd never been too comfortable there having come from windows; so I always used the GUI (KDE) and made system adjustment in YaST.<br />This book has helped educate me on &#34;getting under the hood&#34; of my openSUSE system and I'm discovering it's full potential.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is an awesome weapon simulator. I especially love the effects and music. I'd love to see more WW2 weapons too. Keep it up, weaphones! I expect more things to come!  Also, I love the feel of heroism the veterans of WW2 has committed to protecting the freedom that is more precious than anything else in the world. :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging but worth it, some things take some time to figure out but if you're patient you will get it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a fun puzzling game for kids. The challenges on each level were difficult  and fun. You should get this app
0671449028|5.0|Great bedtime book, lots of fun to read, my daughter enjoys looking at the animals and the rhyming. They brush their teeth and take a bath and then go exercise (then to bed)...not sure about the order of events but it rhymes and is fun.
0062107062|5.0|A pretty much tell all work of art in my opinion Chris writes a book that flows well<br />Gives me a sense of pride.
B00CWV8X04|5.0|Makes you think. Keeps you guessing. Nicely directed. The movie flows smoothly. A little slow to build up. But, worth it.
B009AJD5E0|2.0|There are fans of the Alien films who watch new installments with relish, no matter how poorly constructed they might be. Some of us want more than mere spinoffs and hope for a return to the quality present early in the series. I loved the first two Alien movies.  The way Ridley Scott built the suspense in the original Alien film--that was masterful, a real one of a kind, ground-breaking film.  The second movie expanded nicely upon the first, adding more characters and action.  After that, the franchise slid downhill.<br /><br />Spoiler alert: Prometheus has some great elements, but they are not knit together with any sort of logic.  The characters, supposedly scientists and space travel experts, engage in ridiculously risky behaviors over and over and over--they seem incapable of learning from their mistakes.  Great acting was wasted in this film.  Exquisite special effects could not redeem it.  I found myself uninspired by any of the characters, most of whom seemed to be frenetically racing towards their doom as if death was a goal instead of something to be avoided.  David, the android, was the one character well-rounded and interesting enough to warrant any sympathy.  To a smaller degree, admiration is due the captain and his two crewmates who faced their end with modesty and nobility.  Everyone else deserved to fall prey to the Darwin principal of survival of the fittest and find themselves eliminated from the gene pool.  As for Noomi Rapace, I thought she was beyond amazing in the Dragon Tattoo Swedish films.  In Prometheus, she forged on against formidable odds, wrenching pain, traumas and terrors galore, but none as lethal as the plot of this film.  I hope she survives appearing in it.
B008IBP24C|5.0|I love this series!  It takes us back to a time that it full of romance, drama and what we might have thought to be a simplier time; however you discover at the end of each show that you have been sitting on the edge of your seat, holding your breath and wondering what will come next.  I wish that the series would lst longer, and come around sooner.  It's hard to wait so long to get back to the family that everyone falls in love with the more you watch.  All are great actors and play out their rolls so well, you forget that it's not real.  Such sadness for the Crawley family!!!
1603425381|5.0|This is such a fun book to have it give me many fun and fancy different Edgings to put on my blankets.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is a great note taking app.  I use it for my shopping lists and also for keeping track of what I need to do.  You do not have to be connected to a network, you can use it anywhere.  You can change the color of the notes, but I just keep it yellow like original sticky notes.  It's also pretty easy to save something as a printable or e-mailable document as well.  I recommend it.
0783233477|5.0|The scene in the hospital when Death (Pitt) is talking to the woman about her passing was inspiring to me.  His honesty resonates.  The \\"going\\" when this life is over need not be empty.  The pretty pictures we collect of a life well lived come along with us....and they are ALL we get to take.<br /><br />The scene imprinted on my heart and changed the way I look at experiences.  Not sure why it was profound....just was.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Always been a Ken Follett fan and this does not disappoint at all. What a great way to view this piece of history! I am looking foward to the next books.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Drives me crazy, but I can't stop playing it. My friends and relatives started me on it and I haven't been able to stop. It's additive.
B004UB9SKS|3.0|It took me 3 tries to down load this. Once I got it the phases are accurate and spoken well (I'm using Vietnamese) I thought there would be a dictionary or the ability to tap into one from the program. The choices and variety are good but I though there would be more to this. It will be a good tool for certain situations when traveling but not as a tool to interpret some one speaking or writing to you.
1781162646|5.0|Once again Stephen King paints a picture of a time period like nobody else can.  This is a great crime novel with just a touch of the supernatural.  This book had me right at the first page. I loved the characters and ended up being concerned about them which is always a good sign. I had no real clue as to &#34;who done it&#34; until the very end.  It is a great coming of age story and if you enjoyed &#34;Stand By Me&#34; &#34;The Green Mile&#34; and &#34;The Shawshank Redemption&#34; it's written in a similar manner. I noticed a majority of the low rankings are due to it not being available on an e-reader, get over it.  I went online and ordered it from Amazon, got it in the mail a few days later, and it didn't kill me.  Ranking the book low without reading the book should not be allowed.
B000UJ48WC|2.0|I had seen this movie years ago, but had never read the book. After recently reading the book and enjoying it I decided to watch the movie again. I may be comparing it to the book too much, but the movie was not half as engaging as the book.<br /><br />If you have not read the book, read it and skip the movie.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book was an emotional roller coaster and kept me on the edge of my seat with it's twists and turns.  It is very well written and is one of those books you can't stop thinking about after you've finished it.  Excellent!!!
1781162646|4.0|Joyland is a great summer read. Stephen King did a great job of painting the picture of a quiet southern beach town and its amusement park. The story is entertaining and short by King's standards and thats what made it a great summer read, its pure enjoyment.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app because when I forget my bible I can use the app and read off of that.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The costumes, sets, storyline, and characters are rich, multi-layered and utterly captivating. The only downside is that after the first show you'll be hooked!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best! I love playing with my friends and I have a blast playing it! I think everyone should get this game!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really liked it only took me two days to read. Would have taken one if I didn't have a child yo take care of.
B007ZCQJOM|5.0|Fun listen, definitely won't be getting tired of this one anytime soon. Nice song variety, only complaint would be that the last few tracks slow down a bit too much, but I think they were going for an epic finish especially with the hidden track.
B002RI9X8S|5.0|Just read this book. You will never regret it. A joy from the first word to the last. That is all.
B005H5H3LW|4.0|Space Yamato purists will be certain to point out a ton of nitpicks.  This is to be expected when one tries to compress what essentially was a 12 hour story line into 2.5 hours.<br /><br />What they have done is impressive to say the least.  It does a much better job than the original Space Battleship Yamato movie.  The original movie was a 2 hour \\"highlight\\" reel complete with a bad voice over which said things like \\"Yamato went to Jupiter and fought.....Then went to Pluto and fought....Then went to.....\\".  Very poor indeed and actually almost unwatchable.<br /><br />This new feature doesn't try any of that.  What we are left with is a tighter story line with a lot more continuity with enough plot devices from the first series to be familiar.  I won't spoil it but suffice it to be say, you will easily recognize certain aspects from the first season.<br /><br />What I found even better was how it incorporated some threads from \\"Arrivederci Yamato\\" as well.  Again, I won't spoil it, but you will see some definite paralells between certain plot devices and that story as well.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed it. It is a nice adaptation and the acting is better than I expected.  The production values are also better than I thought.<br /><br />If you are a Yamato fan, and can deal with a little plot manipulation, then you will like this retelling.  If you are however a hardcore fan, theres plenty there you will find disturbing.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|The portrayal of writers block, laziness, procrastination or whatever other myriad of terms you may call it, as Resistance is brilliant.<br /><br />As a filmmaker and writer, I connected immediately and powerfully with this book, and it has inspired me to continue on my artistic path with a stronger and cleaner vision. If you want to create something honest and good, read this book. It will help.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|More rooms please! Awesome game. Nicely challenging without being annoying or un doable. Love it! I like the secret agent man style to some of the rooms. They were most challenging but fun. The rooms with more number and Color combos became a bit tedious especially when the level had multiple rooms. They were predictable and I was glad to be over with it. But overall a great addicting game! Cant wait for more rooms!
B0046UGSNS|1.0|I didn't hate the movie, even because I can't hate something that I not even finish watching! I tried to watch it twice, at the 1st time it stopped work after 23min, I sent an email asking what I could do about it, and I got the answer really fast, I did what they said, but after 1h it stopped work again, then I just gave up and never tried again.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Very good, was a  user friendly and  easy to pick up hard to see down I would suggest it to anyone who likes games
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I look forward to the subway rides to read this!  She's a gorgeous writer.  This book has made me more reflective, strive to be a stronger woman, and tell my mom I love her more.
B0001I561E|2.0|We have old DVDs that play in our Blu Ray just fine; this disc won't, however, so I'm wondering about its authenticity.  I will be returning it.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|I loved this DVD becasue it is very inspiring showing how a person makes a difference in one's life.  He gave him his life back rather than medciate him so he can slowly die everyday like they do with the elderly here.  Shame on the U.S.  Let's overmedicate our elderly and sick rather than try to give life meaning as people age.  Medicare in U.S. is pathetic and the politicians have the nerve to try to cut more for the elderly.  I say let's cut the politicians health care in Washington and see how they like it.  Just vote them all out during the elections.<br />Whether one year or 35 years as a Congreesperson, their health care is the BEST!
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|This film was mediocre at best with comic book action sequences. However, the biggest drawback was the constant reloading of the video which interrupted the flow of the movie.
B008469DGY|5.0|I had done difficulty in the beginning estimating how to click, but once I got use to it...I couldn't resist!  Most finally one of the best golf games around!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After reading all the reviews i bought the book even though i knew the was going to be a cliff hanger. enjoyed reading the book didn't like how much of a cliff hanger i was going to be getting. The book ends and you are looking at it like WTF. Cant wait for the next book really hopping its not a year away fr it to come out that would be a waste and i would forget what was going on much like this book took me a min to catch up on what happen in the first and second book. Fingers crossed that its out sooner then later.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoyed this game. I have played a lot of hidden object games. This one was complex, but not confusing. The layout was not so difficult that you forget where you need to be.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It is easy to use...the price was right !!  Installed very easily.  I think it will be very useful to have.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I thought it was pretty useless and a waste of time. I was sorry I bothered with it.  Oh well, I tried it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a riveting story about an ordinary family like any other. How a murder of a local teenager impacts the family and the community is very believable and each step of the way leads to an unforgettable ending. a can't-put-it-down page turner.
B00454U1NS|5.0|Excellent CD by Pink, of her greatest hits so far.  So glad I got it. I love her music and this is loaded with super songs!
0812982622|5.0|Terrific writing, with a compelling and slightly horrifying tale.  I couldn't put it down.  I recommend this book highly especially for anyone interested in the mysteries of North Korea.
B005544V6A|5.0|best show that I've watched this year.  Good show to binge watch.  I would give it 5 starts out of 5 stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was fun entertaining and cool that you got to travel around the world. But we need not chances to collect keys
B000UBMSB8|5.0|It was cool to see the theatrical version for the first time in over 30 years.  I love buying CD's and DVD's on Amazon.  Downloading MP3's is also becoming a favorite.  Anyway you decide.  Amazon is fast, convenient, and inexpensive.  Good - Fast - Cheap... and you can get all 3!
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Season 4 of Breaking Bad was a gripping season seeing The characters evolve into something bigger then ever before. Very good season.
0891419063|5.0|I have seen the series &#34;Pacific&#34; several times, and as I read &#34;The Old Breed&#34;, I saw evidence of scenes following the book, and other scenes that appeared to me, to be extraneous, and Hollywood-inspired.  I highly recommend the book to anyone who is interested in the fightingman's perspective off what war is all about.
0307474259|5.0|I purchased 4 books.  I read the first one last year and lost 48 lbs. by following Gary Taubes advice.  I am giving the three I just bought to friends.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|In his typical style, Khaled takes us through the world from the eyes of a family in Afghanistan. The Kite Runner felt way better than this one though.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Can't believing I'm saying this but it had too much sex in it!! It's almost like she was running out of things to write and so she filled the gaps with unrealistic sex! The ending was ridiculous and leaves you hanging expecting a surprise wedding by the description of her dress and other details I was horribly let down as nothing gets resolved between the two only more complications! Enough is enough Sylvia there is such a thing as a happy ending!!!
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|David Baldacci does it again with this Book, like all his others it was a good read and met my expertations.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is not to hard and not to easy. I like this game because kids and adults can play it.
1781162646|5.0|Not your typical King novel, absolutely wonderful story! I loved it! It will make you cry like a baby.Read it!
0525953728|5.0|This was a great story, however, I can't help wonder if too much information wasn't divulged.  SEALs should be more enigmatic.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My whole family loves to play it. Yay yay<br />So Much fun. Can't stop playing Love this app a lot.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's great for older kids but not younger kids because there are a lot of buttons with no words.  Also you can buy do not need to purchase in-game items.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|The author must be buying reviews, because there are several issues with the book. First of all, the grammar and editing are just terrible. It distracts from the reading flow. The story is predictable.The characters unlikeable. There are no twists, but just exaggerated scenes. This is one of the most drawn out books I have ever read with dialogue that is unrealistic. There is no way teens talk like that. What really irked me off are the characters. Seriously, when you remember all of a sudden that your father raped you every day, do you fall in bed with someone on the same day? Do some research!!! I wasted 4 hours of my life and wish people would write HONEST reviews, not allowing family or friends of the author to write them.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This took me a year to read. but I had to read it thru and I found it extremely interesting and I learned alot from it. as I am a cancer survivor i was overly emoitional. there were so many things i didn't know and i understood more.<br />the detail and gathering of this information was incredible and overwhelming at times.<br />but well worth the effort and time.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|I did not get the product I ordered as I ordered it.There was no dvd cover ,the disk was stuck in a used plastic square holder, and was scribbled on label with black marker blocking out name of rental company.disk has more then surfaces scratches.would not purchase from this dealer again.this is just a warning to other customers. Other dealers have refunded my money with no questions asked havent heard a word from this dealer...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just challenging enough to keep me entertained. Really liked this game, only got stumped once on level 10. Great app!
B000X9Q8A4|5.0|I really loved the movie and I've had a great time listening/singing along with all the great Beatles songs. If you like the movie, treat yourself to the soundtrack!
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|LOVED the movie...LOVED the music.  For me, the music captures the spirit of the movie perfectly. Especially &#34;What Are You Going To Do When You Are Not Saving The World?&#34;.
B005IQZB14|3.0|I've heard there are rumors that she embellished her adventure.  I don't know if that is true.  But during the first half of the book I had trouble reading the book.  I could not believe that someone would be so ill prepared. She was irritating.  I understand she is in her young 20's; but really!  I did finish the book; but not in time for our book club as I stopped to read another book.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh Groban is my all-time favorite singer.  I just fell in love with his voice the first time I heard it.  His music is beautiful.  This CD is one of my favorites after Awake.  I love the foreign language songs as much as the English songs.  Wonderful CD!
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Got it as a Father's Day gift for my hubby.<br />He loves it :)<br /><br />A bit expensive, but isn't everything anymore
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Fun, addictive game but homework hard to get unless you play the game constantly. Same rare plants grow when plant rare seeds and don't get credit on quests for planting mystery seeds or the 10,000 coin seeds. Long time in between quests.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|A college class should be taught on this film.  I've &#34;gone off&#34; of Woody Allen's films (of which I have been a fan for years), but this one is classic Woody.  If you like his films, and have not seen this, do yourself a favor and watch.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|The Rosie Project gives insight to the quirkiness of characters that we all come across in real life. It was just a lovely read and I will look for more from this author.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I understand that Brooks wrote the Zombie Survival Guide and this book is somewhat of an offshoot. I'm not into the whole zombie thing so that may be why I didn't love it. However, it is well written and I had no problem enjoying it from cover to cover.<br />The interesting thing about this book is if you mentally substitute any pandemic for the zombie fever, it is a good perspective on what would happen with a major outbreak. All together worth a read.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Just found this author.  Only downside is once  you open the book you won't get thing else done until u finish the book!  Addictive.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Why is this thing so popular? It sounds like it was written by a pre-teen girl. The sex parts were about as sexy as a paper bag. I couldn't even get through it so I skimmed it and that was a struggle. I thought, since I'm a guy, I was missing something so I turned it over to my wife. She gave up trying to read it after about 10 minutes. Her opinion was the same as mine.<br />I know there are people out there who love this series. However, it's a mystery to me. My advice would be see if you can find a free PDF of this book and save you cash!
B000FC1MOQ|5.0|I've read this book before.....one of the best written books ever.  A MUST read.  It is such a good book to read.
1582701709|1.0|Total &#34;magical thinking&#34; and &#34;new age&#34; garbage. If you are a delusional loser, you may find this helpful. However, it leaves out the most important component of success: HARD WORK!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I have the whole series up to  season 7.  --- Since I don't have Showtime I wait for the DVD to come out at the end of the season.  I especially like not having to wait between episodes.
B000001E3L|5.0|It was perfect. I recd it on time and in great condition .<br />Its a must have for any Van Morrison fan
193700788X|5.0|I have read all of the Sookie Stackhouse series and I enjoyed this..  I recommend the series to everyone who loves vampire stories.
B0000071GA|5.0|this was the album that introduced krokus to the states they toured with def leppard and eventually on there own
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|Harvey is a classic!  I saw it years ago, watched it again with my children and wanted my teenage grandchildren to see it as well. Sometimes we lose sight of how good movies can be without all the language, sex and violence. The mix of personalities and mini plots within the story are fun to watch.  My granddaughter doesn't like black and white movies, but loved this one.<br /><br />Now they know what I'm talking about when I mention &#34;Pookas&#34;.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|As an avid MTG player, I wanted something like this to play on-the-go.  It fills that void nicely.  The added bonus of having a sealed deck mode is nice.  My complaints come from the bugginess, several times I've had to force-stop the app to get it to respond to touches. Selecting individual spell targets can be tricky with sausage hands and there have been many times the timer wouldn't respond to my input, thus losing games due to being unable to perform combat tricks.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|If your a fan of the original Wizard of Oz I think you'll this one. It nicely connects the movies in a way that makes you go ahhh.  It's also a family friendly movie my kids love it too!
B007FKI9G0|4.0|The movie has many hidden jokes under their breath which makes me want to watch it over again. Classic film.
B005HV6Y84|4.0|I don't like this as much as the soundtracks from the other films, but I'm very fond of the song by Green Day.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|Really enjoy watching the movie.  For some reason, unfortunately it won't play on our main system, but does work on our other one.  If you like sci fi, I think you'd like this one.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|This is one unique, talented young man. Phillip Phillips deserves all the success that comes his way. Buy this DVD. It's worth it.
B002361MLA|4.0|An excellent book that states the obvious...&#34;all that we really have is now.&#34;  It is so obvious that I often forget its power.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|All you have to do is listen to the song &#34;Carry On&#34; once and you'll be hooked. My daughter is a boxer and it's our song.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|So far I am really intrigued by the story and the characters.  I can't wait to see what happens next!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I can NOT believe they stopped making Firefly episodes.  Unbelievable!  So, if you liked Firefly, you'll automatically like Serenity.  (though I think the movie would do OK as a stand alone if you're just a HUGE [[ASIN:B009RIMPIG Castle]] fan and want to see Nathan in some of his early shows....he is also in [[ASIN:B003WSRRVC Buffy]]]<br />Serenity is like icing on the cake.  Sure, the series is gone forever, but they took the whole storyline and dumped all the rest of the backstory into one brilliant movie.  You'll cry, you'll scream, you'll cheer....and you'll love it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Great story, exciting characters,funny as all get out. It keeps you interested and amused and wanting to know what happens next. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves romance and sex.

0425263924|2.0|What can I say that a lot of people hasn't said already.  Yes I was disappointed that the 3rd book didn't end well and there was no closure. I felt that the story was all over the place and maybe rushed in some places but I am still a huge fan of Sylvia's and I love Gideon and Eva.<br /><br />I am sad that the book didn't end well but I am also happy that Eva and Gideon's story has not ended yet!  So looking forward to the next book.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I picked up this book while on vacation and loved the story.  I decided they could never make a movie because of the boy and the animals being on the ocean during most of the story.  When it came out and I saw the previews I knew they had done a great job.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been desperately searching for this caliber of writing. If I could have given Wool ten stars I would have. Howey has created a future world that is horrifying and all too believable. I loved the strong female main character. In fact all of the characters were believable and their actions and motives and dialogue fit. The pace of the action was perfect. The conflict was great wrenching.The book was clean. I was emotionally invested. And I am now finally invested in my new favorite author : Howey. I can't wait to read more.

0670026557|5.0|Adam Grant wrote, \\"By shifting ever so slightly in the giver direction, we might find out waking hours marked by greater success, richer meaning, and more lasting impact.\\"  In a twist of irony, I lost my job a third of the way through reading this book.  What could have been a desperate time of me reaching out to contacts in the hopes of finding the elusive job, I felt myself moving in a giver direction by helping others going through something similar, or using the networking conversations to have the primary goal of establishing a relationship as opposed to finding a job.  This \\"strategy\\" is the right course of action over the long haul.<br /><br />In all of us, the book pulls us to pay attention to our own tendencies and leads us down a path to success by modifying these habits.  We don't have to be a \\"doormat\\", but can you believe being \\"powerless (with your communication)\\" can be a contributing factor toward your success?  I felt myself identify with every chapter in the book, which is a good indicator it was impacting my thought process.  The book resonated with me, as I suspect it will with most readers.  There's a little bit of giving and taking in all of us.  How we choose to use it can potentially influence our success.<br /><br />In the simple act of reading the book, I began to actively practice and take action, both consciously and subconsciously--and found it exhilarating and real.  I found myself fundamentally changing my outlook on giving, not because this book is full of flavor of the day business jargon, but because of the common sense approach has proven research supporting the success trajectory time and time again.  This book will guide you to make the decision on your own that changing, or reinforcing your habits depending on your own self-reflection, is a paradigm shift worth doing.  I can't remember the last time I was influenced so much by a book.  - Thomas B. Dowd III, author of \\"The Transformation of a Doubting Thomas:  Growing from a Cynic to a professional in the Corporate World\\"c to a professional in the Corporate World\\"
0062238310|5.0|I purchased this script, as my husband commented more than a few times that he sometimes had a difficult time understanding the accents of the characters.

0307730700|5.0|MY TAKE:<br /><br />First off let me just say, \\"WOW\\".  I have always loved anything military.  I was in Air Force ROTC, I wanted to be the first female fighter pilot to fight in combat.  Unfortunately, my eyesight wouldn't allow that though.  But underneath all of my girlie tendencies, I am fully a tomboy and military woman at heart.  So this book was an absolute must read for me.<br /><br />Not only was it in the style that I like, but it had a topic that I liked in more ways then one.  See, Adam was an addict.  While I read this book, my husband was going through some of the grueling addiction problems that Adam went through.  It was so encouraging for me to see Adam come out the other side and become such an incredible man that would ultimately die for each one of us...for our freedom and safety.<br /><br />This was an absolute page turner.  I have already passed it on to my father to read....then it will go to my husband.  It will continue to make its rounds within my circle of friends.  That is how I know it is a good book, when I am willing to share it with others.<br /><br />Don't believe me?  Want to read the first chapter and find out on your own?

B008YWY0HK|5.0|Its hard to believe the quality of the graphics in this movie. It has a great story line and I have watched it several time with different grandkids and it is a hit every time.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Really fun game with a nice campaign mode. Easy to just jump right in. The various units available also add a strategic aspect to it.
0679722610|2.0|My book club chose to read this book because it's listed as one of the top 500 books to read. Our group didn't really care for it because it was hard to follow, we didn't know the meaning of the old slang words used, and there wasn't a lot of mystery to the book (the top 500 list listed this as a murder mystery). If you're looking for a good murder mystery in this era, I would suggest reading Agatha Christie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read all 3 books in less than a week. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for more. I have been recommending to everyone. I think I liked it even better than 50 Shades.

B00B4FU6KE|5.0|This book was written in such a way that I actually thought it was a memoir for about the first half (I read it over the Kindle, so I forgot what the author's name was)... Karen Joy Fowler clearly did her research and made an effort to make the story as realistic as possible. The plot is fascinating in itself (my husband kept asking for mini updates as I read), and I had a hard time putting it down. Definitely a worthwhile read!

055338466X|5.0|\\"One can't prove that God doesn't exist, but science makes God unnecessary.\\" - Stephen Hawkins<br /><br />This is a great popular presentation of physics and cosmology and their relevance to the origins of the universe and thus human existence. The authors explain how the universe could have come to be with the universal laws of physics alone, no \\"god\\" or \\"gods\\" necessary.<br /><br />While I highly recommend this book to a general audience, experts in the field of physics won't probably won't find much of value.<br /><br />See also Carl Sagan's introduction to Hawkin's [[ASIN:0553346148 A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes]]: \\"a universe with no edge in space, no beginning or end in time, and nothing for a Creator to do.\\"
B007QWF26C|4.0|\\"Blade II\\" was always my favorite film of the original Wesley Snipes trilogy. It's a great beer and popcorn flick.<br /><br />You can pretty much gather the main storyline from the first few opening minutes (no need to see the first film, which I thought was so-so).<br /><br />The action sequences in this film are plentiful and well choreographed, and definitely you can see how skillful Guillermo del Toro is at directing this type of film - there's a scene in a vampire night club that follows the action happening in about four or five different locations simultaneously that is a hoot to watch.<br /><br />It looks like all of the special features from the DVD Platinum Edition of this film were ported over - the interviews with Guillermo del Toro are pretty funny and entertaining themselves.<br /><br />Blade II holds up quite well in hi-def. The makeup and special effects (especially the disintegrating vampires) still look pretty cool for the most part. Worth getting if you are a fan.
B002ZG997C|5.0|One of my personel favorite movies. Very well done, not over done like most sci-fi flicks now days. Denzel Washington is fantastic. Great story with a great surprize ending. Love it!

B002IY5DL2|5.0|They don't make movies like this anymore. Every time I watch it, about once a year, I appreciate it all the more. The cast of charecters is great, not just the main ones, but everyone in the flick. The music, the lighting, I just enjoy this flick alot. The art of movie making is almost a forgotten artform as far as I am concerned.
B004GYY714|5.0|i eas surpprise to hear so excelent quality, and so versatil and ease using app, tottaly recomended to everyone, get it
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|For a film named for a piece of music within the story it tells, the soundtrack is uniformly uninspired. Various genre stories are interwoven, without any of them transcending the limitations of other films their styles are borrowed from. While some of the secondary actors are good, the stars given secondary performances. Nothing wrong with it as a B movie, except it tries so lamely to be more.

1612191290|5.0|One of the most important and fascinating subjects discussed in this book, is the<br />different forms of money, why we have them, what they indicate about a time or place, and<br />so on.  Graeber believes that coinage containing precious metals becomes prevalent during<br />times of war and under other circumstances where you cannot count on or trust someone on<br />the other end of a transaction, whereas \\"trust money\\" (debt, credit, fiat money, bank<br />notes, etc) comes into use when you *can* count on those with whom you engage in financial<br />transactions.  But, he also claims that coinage often has a value above that of the<br />(precious) metal it contains, which indicates the existence of some amount of trust.<br /><br />Graeber also wants to distinguish between different kinds of trust, in particular between<br />personal trust and impersonal trust.  He claims that most of what we have today (in the<br />U.S. at least) is money (credit, often) based on impersonal trust: your credit score, for<br />example, rather than on a merchant's knowledge of your reliability, family, social circle,<br />etc.<br /><br />Graeber worries that this kind of impersonal money, together with a political system that<br />increasingly privileges business seems to be pushing us in a direction where borrowers<br />have less and less leverage with their lenders.  For example, credit card borrowers and<br />those who hold student loan debt have less and less power to negotiate their loans, to<br />threaten default on their loans as a way of pressuring the lender to forgive part of the<br />loan, etc.  Graeber believes that making a loan and holding a debt has associated risks<br />and that lenders should be willing to accept that risk.  If they are not willing to do so<br />and if the economic and political system backs them up in their refusal to do so, then the<br />system has become too punitive to holders of debt, and we are headed back toward the use<br />of debtors prisons.<br /><br />There are some claims that Graeber makes that are counter to conventional or received<br />wisdom, and that's part of what makes this book interesting.  For example, the Middle<br />Ages, instead of being the dark, miserable times that we've been told, actually were an<br />improvement for most people.  Mostly because of the collapse of empires, slavery was<br />considerably reduced.  And, the amount of work demanded of most people was reduced.<br />Graeber's reasoning is that since cities went into decline, there was not the large urban<br />populations that needed to be fed.  So, the need for large amounts of forced labor and<br />onerous taxes needed to feed and support imperial cities was, to a great extent,<br />eliminated.  The break up of empires, the disappearance of large military forces, and the<br />general loss of control meant reduced power to extract work and resources from peasants.<br /><br />Another somewhat counter-intuitive claim of Graeber's is that during the Middle Ages<br />although the amount of coinage was reduced (it was no longer needed to pay soldiers),<br />attention to and the use of credit money (loans, promissory notes, etc) increased.  And,<br />thus the money system may have been more rather than less sophisticated than during times<br />of empire.<br /><br />Also, in part because of endowments, more and more gold, silver, and precious metal in<br />general ended up in churches and monasteries and temples, thus reducing the amount of<br />precious metal available for coins.  This required the use of trust money, e.g. credit,<br />notes, etc.  We can view this as a shift toward abstraction in the market place and away<br />from concrete forms of instruments, especially coins, although even coins, especially when<br />they trade above the value of the metal in them, have a component of trust in them.<br /><br />China, according to Graeber was very advanced in this regard.  Because of their highly<br />organized bureaucracies and the geographical range of the control of Chinese government,<br />that government could demand that almost anything (again according to Graeber) count as<br />money, and, for example, that it be the required medium for the payment of taxes.<br /><br />Graeber is also trying to encourage us to view debt without myth and emotion.  For<br />example, he wants us to enter into debt relationships (and that is what trust money and<br />debt is: a relationship) without the mythology and emotions that make us feel things like:<br />(1) not paying debts is evil; (2) all debts must be paid; (3) God disapproves of those who<br />fail to pay their debts; etc.  He wants us to view debt as a business relationship<br />unchained from emotion.  Yes, we will want to pay our debts most of the time.  However, a<br />lender enters into a relationship with a certain amount of risk, and that risk must be<br />recognized.  This is, I believe a very liberating point of view.<br /><br />An example of Graeber's intentions and the view of debt and values (feelings of virtue,<br />guilt, evil, etc) he is trying to guide us toward, is his believe that we should try to<br />separate religion from materialism (and markets and debt etc).  Graeber wants us to view<br />our materialistic relationships (especially our debts and loans) through a lens that is<br />unclouded by and not distorted by religion, religious values, the tenants of any<br />particular local church, etc.<br /><br />A historical note, and one that I found fascinating to think about: Graeber believes that<br />debt and credit relationship came very early on in the development of civilization and<br />organized society, likely 3,000 years ago or more.  And that, since debts required<br />accounting and records, those relationships may have encouraged and facilitated the<br />development of mathematics and written language.  I suspect that, if you understand<br />Graeber a little better than I do, you will see that he believes that societies are build<br />out of those credit/debt relationships and the records and financial instruments needed to<br />make them work.  It is both (1) the abstract and symbolic nature of credit and debt and<br />(2) the interpersonal relations which debt and credit promote are the enablers of complex<br />societies.<br /><br />I'm not sure that Graeber is trying to argue for an alternative to capitalism, but he is<br />certainly trying to push us toward thinking about alternative forms of capitalism.  (1) He<br />certainly is against the \\"perma-growth\\" form of capitalism that demands that we produce<br />and consume larger amounts of goods and services each year.  (2) And, he is very much<br />against capitalism based on slavery (or effective slavery) and debt peonage (debts that<br />force the debtor to work without the hope of paying off that debt).  But, then I believe<br />he claims that there are no successful forms of capitalism that are *not* based on some<br />kind of slavery or harsh working conditions.<br /><br />One of Graeber's criticisms of modern capitalism seems to be it's ability to remove the<br />\\"personal\\" from the relationships of credit and debt.  That creates, in his view,<br />non-moral actors.<br /><br />By the way, I found that Graeber's alternative to the view that capitalism is the only<br />solution and that it will make all the world better and happier a refreshing change.<br />Certainly, if we are going to fix the problems that our economy keeps creating, we have to<br />understand some of the problems and some of the variations.<br /><br />I believe that Graeber is attempting to warn us about what he calls the<br />military-coinage-slavery complex.  Or, maybe it's the military-coinage-taxation<br />connection.  Nations and rulers who have armies pay their soldiers in coin (or another<br />type of money if possible), the soldiers buy goods and services from merchants, the rulers<br />tax the merchants, and then the rulers pay the soldiers.  So, an economic system, armies,<br />war, etc are all brought into existence at once.  In a sense, the reason that a government<br />taxes citizens and demands payment of taxes in the official currency is so that citizens<br />earn or acquire that currency which forces others to earn money in that currency, etc.<br />All of which makes the markets and the labor force (and the economy in general) go.  It's<br />called economic activity, I suppose, and when we want to get out of a recession, we are<br />asking for more of that kind of activity.<br /><br />If you decide to read this book, and I certainly think it is worth reading, you should be<br />a little aware of Graeber's background.  He has worked on efforts to prevent the IMF from<br />forcing some countries to make payment on their loans regardless of cost and regardless of<br />who will be hurt.  One of his arguments is that the poor, who are often the ones to<br />suffer, were not the ones that initiated the borrowing in the first place and likely did<br />not get much of the benefit from those loans anyway.  So, you should not be surprised when<br />you detect that Graeber is less than enthusiastic about severe forms of legal coercion to<br />force loan repayment.<br /><br />One very general note -- Because of the wide geographical range thousands of years of time<br />covered by Graeber's analysis, he invites us to think about when where the \\"good times\\",<br />and what was good and bad about those times, and for whom.  We are reading a book that<br />ranges across history that includes the destruction of cities, massive military conquests<br />and deaths, plagues, and extremely punishing slavery, as well as times of prosperity<br />(though perhaps prosperity for a select few) and peace.  The question \\"When and where<br />would we want to have lived?\\" if not when and where we are now, is an amusing one.<br /><br />Even now, in times that many of us living in advanced and calm parts of civilization think<br />are the good times, there are parts of the world where people are suffering from violent<br />and cruel military operations (Syria, especially) and places where the treatment of large<br />labor forces cannot be considered benign or free.  Perhaps we need to replace the claim<br />that capitalism brings prosperity with the claim that capitalism brings prosperity for<br />*some* of us.<br /><br />Underneath Graeber's history of debt and credit and money there is a critique of<br />capitalism as it currently functions in much of the developed countries.  That critique<br />goes a bit like this -- Capitalism does not work when everyone wants their fair slice.<br />Capitalism requires wage slaves, perhaps real slaves and debt peonage.  It can't work<br />without a supply of very cheap labor, so cheap that those laborers do not have a living<br />wage.  And, of course, there are all the ills and problems that must be patched up or, in<br />some cases, just suffered, such as booms and busts, the need for bailouts for banks, the<br />need for banking insurance, constant supervision for malfeasance, and on and on.  If you<br />ignore all those, and the inequality, too, then capitalism works pretty good.  Or, perhaps<br />it's not that capitalism works well; it's that we have no reasonable alternative.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm being too negative.  If you want a more sanguine and humorous account of<br />capitalism that Graeber's, look at [[ASIN:B001FOR5KS On The Wealth of Nations (Books That Changed the World)]],<br />by P. J. O'Rourke.<br /><br />There are lots more fascinating ideas in this book (e.g. his belief that capitalism<br />demands continuous, permanent growth), but this review is long enough already.<br /><br />Some entertaining and related reading:<br /><br />- [[ASIN:1463740514 Extraordinary Popular Delusions and The Madness of Crowds]], by Charles MacKay<br /><br />- [[ASIN:B00DT6A3WM Funny Money by Singer, Mark [2004]]]

A transfer to Blu-ray alone would not alter any of this had not Universal Studios decided to do a loving and amazing restoration from what I can only guess were original negatives, using the latest computer/digital technology to correct scratches and tears and to remove dirt as well as remove the annoying and ever present &#34;hiss&#34; accompanying the original film, given the poor methods of recording audio from 82 years ago.<br /><br />I won't go into the merits of the film itself, however, for a very entertaining and thorough history of &#34;Dracula&#34;, from its beginnings when Bram Stoker first wrote it up to about the 1980's when Bela Lugosi's family unsuccessfully sued Universal for the unlicensed use of Bela's image on figures and other &#34;Dracula&#34; related toys, I strongly recommend the book, &#34;Hollywood Gothic&#34; by David J. Skal.<br /><br />The one major draw of this Blu-ray release easily is the fact that the Spanish version of &#34;Dracula&#34;, also restored, is included. This version was made on the same sets as the Tod Browning directed/Lugosi starring version, which filmed during the day and then the Spanish cast and film crew would come in to shoot at night. The fact that the director of the Spanish version, George Melford, was not himself Spanish as well as his not even speaking the language was no hindrance to him. It has been said that this version made far more inventive use of the sets with superior camera angles and lighting and one gets to see how true this actually is. I had never seen this version before and, after my first viewing immediately following my viewing of the Browning/Lugosi version, I was able to see how much more, (pardon the pun), &#34;alive&#34; the whole movie became. Compare thetwo yourself and see if you come away feeling that the original looks as stuffy and claustrophobic as being inside the Count's coffin.<br /><br />Rounding out the Blu-ray are some nice extras about the history of both versions as well as commentary by the aforementioned David J. Skal, who provides only a smattering of the information you can get about the history of the property by reading his book. An interview with actress, Lupita Tovar, who played &#34;Lucia&#34; in the Spanish version is sweet and somewhat informative. As of this writing, she is still alive at 102!<br /><br />Finally, this movie is also included in Universal's Blu-ray set of their &#34;Classic Monsters&#34; movies that also contains &#34;The Wolf Man&#34;, &#34;Frankenstein&#34;, &#34;The Bride of Frankenstein&#34;, &#34;The Invisible Man&#34;, &#34;The Mummy&#34;,&#34;Phantom of the Opera&#34;, and &#34;Creature From the Black Lagoon&#34;. Universal has begun releasing each of these individually for people, like myself, who wanted to choose &#34;a la carte&#34;.

076244911X|5.0|I have been a Kylie Minogue fan since I was very young and her first ablum Kylie came out in 1988. Bought Enjoy Yourself in 1989, all of Kylies releases from 1990 to 2000 via import, and her ablums from 2001 to the present on the date of release in US record stores. So that will tell you how much of a Kylie fan I am. So when I heard about Kylie Fashion, I knew I had to have it! So glad I purchased it from Amazon. I cannot stop looking at it! The photos of Kylie never cease to amaze. And unlike La La La, William Baker does not seem keen on interviewing himself. It is also an insightful book! Kylie Fashion is a essential for all Kylie fans, both for those who have been fans since the 1980s, and for those who may have just discovered her music.

B0046B1KHG|5.0|I've seen this movie a couple of times already, and can't seem to get enough of it.  After watching Despicable Me 2 in the theater on opening day, I just had to download this and watch it again on My Kindle Fire.<br />The story is a little dark, because of the girls' predicament, but lightens up, considerably, early on.  All of the characters are lovable - but the minions stole the show!<br /><br />Fortunately there is a Minions movie scheduled to be released late 2014 - I can't wait!<br /><br />Recommendation: watch this, then going to see the sequel.  You'll be happy you did.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|After becoming a prime member of amazon, I decided to download the kindle app. It's pretty cool you can pretty much have a kindle on your smartphone.

006123141X|4.0|Since one of my favorite perspectives of history is through the Celtic part of my own heritage, this caught my interest immediately (that, and because it's from James Rollins).<br />When a firestorm destroys a refugee camp in Africa and a Vatican priest is killed off in Italy at the same time, it's up to Sigma to figure out the mysteries of what is going on and why. This time, things are not going to go well. Almost at all. As is usual for Sigma, two groups go to different locations to figure out a mystery from different perceptions and figure things out alternately. This time, the stories outnumber the teams, and the twists outnumber the chapters.<br />The central mystery deals with what's called the \\"quartered circle/cross\\" and how it deals with Celtic legends and how those legends are a part of real-life intrigue and why a Norwegian madman is trying to do what he's doing- strangle the world food supply. Much of what is discussed in all angles definitely seem plausible. At times, maddeningly so.<br />Then there are the substories that tear into emotion- especially that of Sigma trying to save Rachel Verona's life. And the hyperparanoia of Seichan (I thought Kat was the only good at stylishly throwing knives, apparently not). Turns out her paranoia is more than important all the time.<br />If there was anything off for me, it was that, at times, it felt like the story seemed to drag on occasion, not to mention only a purely scientific view of the history of the Celtic cross was presented (which gives little hope in the view of Irish history). With the real ending in the Epilogue, this has me drooling to get after The Devil Colony to find out just how big the \\"war\\" that Painter talked about will be.

B006VA57CY|5.0|I love this show for it's entertainment and educational value. What I want to know, however, is this: Does the matron's lady O\\"Brien ever get her due? For God's sake she committed premeditated murder of her lady's unborn child and might have killed the lady in the bargin. If this thread gets lost I'd say it's an unconscionable flaw in the plot.
B00005RDRO|5.0|A classic comedy movie with a great cast!  I am glad that I was able to find this movie.  Thanks!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I also have the sequel.  Both are a ton of fun.  Very hard.  I can't beat all of it.  Certainly worth the purchase.

B0018OAOQC|5.0|Again, what can I say.  I like Volbeats style of music.  Country and metal wrapped into one.  I will continue to purchase more of their music.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|After walking out of the movie, but seeing great reviews for the books, I thought I'd give Jack Reacher another chance. \\"Killing Floor \\" is a fairly fast-moving story that's easy to follow, has interesting characters (especially Reacher), and a good plot, but Child's writing style is awkward.  He uses short, choppy sentences that often begin without a subject and obscure words and phrases that are more distracting than interesting. I'm going to read the next book in the series - it is previewed in \\"Killing Floor\\" and appears to be written in a more fluid style.
B00756GRUE|5.0|I love everything about this watch.  I did replace the band that I'll have to get resized) with a nato band and it looks great.  I get compliments all the time on this watch.<br />  The glow on the hands and markers is very bright.<br />  The watch is easy to set up.  The rotating bezel is not too tight, not too lose.<br /><br />***2 Years Later***<br />  I've had this watch for more than 2 years now.  It's part of my watch rotation.  It still keeps excellent time.  After 6 months, it might lose 5 seconds.  Outstanding!  It doesn't have a sapphire crystal, but it doesn't need one.  I've banged the face against things several times and it's still as good as new.  I still have nothing negative to say about this watch.  For under $200 this is the best solar dive watch you can buy.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|7/8/13  Over the 4th of July holiday we rented this film via Amazon Prime.  For our taste it was just wonderful!.  Acting was great and we loved the story line.  The cost of the rental via Amazon Prime was beyond reasonable.  Where could we go to a movie theater and pay $5.00...$2.50 per ticket for two....be in the nice cool A/C of our home...no crowd....fabulous food...worked out great!  We highly recommend this film and would think it okay for maybe 9 on up.  A little cussing, but probably nothing that most kids haven't heard.  If you are a parent that are bothered if your child hears one cuss word and/or you are an adult who just cannot tolerate an off beat work...this is not for you.  Otherwise....try it!
B00846REIS|4.0|First and foremost the only reason people are comparing this book to FSOG because they haven't read other books of this kind relating to the type of sex that is experienced in both these series.  The main difference is that this book is written much better.  The only reason that FSOG received such accolades because some PR blew it up.  Now the reason for this review yes this story is almost exactly mirrored to FSOG except that instead of the naive girl from modest beginnings who is a virgin who by chance runs into a fiflthy rich adopted screwed up gorgeous man; with this one its two totally screwed up individuals who come from a somewhat privileged but very extremely crazy past involving deviant sexual abuse of which that connection which have brought them together.<br /><br />There is really no storyline per se, but its about a relationship between two people trying to learn to trust and love through a hell of a lot of sex and jealousy which is very prevalent throughout the course of this book. Now people who have issues with the constant sex every couple of pages, lets call it what this book is an erotic novel just like they protrayed FSOG out to be which ofcourse is not true...ive read more descriptive sex in a regular novel...Although the sex was interesting it did become a bit overkill but unlike some of the other comments ive read I could not skip overthem I guess that makes me a freak but nonetheless it was a good read and I couldn't put it down mostly because of my love for books and for my insatiable addiction to wonder what comes next. Read this book without bias and stop comparing it to the highly overrated FSOG and take it for what it is an erotic novel. If you can get pass the steamy sex scenes then this is the book for you. If you are a FSOG fan or even if your not you will see that this is written so much better and much more descriptive HAPPY READING

Thank you for the quote from Carl Sagan, I believe he always had it right. My dearest loving husband who passed away in 2011 is waiting for me to join him so we can explore the Universe together, he is my star dust now and forever. You will love this story. It has everything you need to make reading a true adventure.  I can't say enough about how much I loved this book. You never fail to disappoint me Mr. Rollins! A must read in my opinion.

B005DD7H50|3.0|Mystery thriller about unapproved drug designed to boost usage of brain to 100% but with bad side effects - of course. It is not a bad movie but it wasn't really the kind of movie I like - not enough action , screwball main character I did not care for, girlfriend that a cardboard cutout, stupid mobster. It may have booster his brain power but it did not boost his morals.

B001NAT05W|4.0|No, it's not like the comic book. Big deal. It is fun, sexy, snazzy, and wonderfully campy. The graphics were good in some places and bad in others. But hey! Halle Berry (in leather, no less) and Sharon Stone? What's not to drool over?<br /><br />I found it funny, in a \\"not funny ha-ha\\" way, that so many people were put off by Halle's character, in both her incarnations. Yes, she was mousy and timid before she became Catwoman. So? She found her power, and used it to do good things, to get back at the people who killed her. Gosh, wish I had found MY power like that! It's camp, in a very good way. I have to think that those who didn't like it because it wasn't \\"comic book\\" just really need to stand back and take a look at their comic obsession . . . maybe it is time to move out of mom's basement and get a real life. Then maybe you won't get your panties tied in a knot and can just sit back and have a bit of fun.
B008JFUPLC|4.0|Monsters University, the sequel/prequel to 2001's highly popular Monsters, Inc., is entertaining and fast-paced enough to keep you from being bored. The problem is that you won't be surprised either.  It's probably a film more to be enjoyed by kids who haven't seen all of the movies that MU draws - heavily - on and who aren't familiar with the well-used formulas that seem to make up most of what passes for plot.  Don't get me wrong.  MU isn't bad by any means. It does entertain and it does provide some interesting background for the characters - mainly \\"Sully\\" Sullivan and Mike Wazowski, but also their nemesis-to-be, Randy Boggs - that we remember from Monsters, Inc., and introduces some new characters as well.  The only problem is that we've seen it all before and so nothing really surprises.<br /><br />The plot of MU is how Mike and Sully (voice perfectly by the inimitable Billy Crystal and John Goodman) first came to meet before they went to work for Monsters, Inc.  The film begins with a very young Mike going on a school field trip to Monsters, Inc. Wanting to see everything - which is hard when you're the shortest guy in the class - Mike ends up getting an unexpected experience of seeing close up what it's like to be a Scarer. And is immediately hooked, knowing what he wants to do in life. And where he has to go in order to learn how to do it:  Monsters University.<br /><br />Things flash-forward a few years when Mike first sets foot in the hallowed halls of MU, where he meets - and quickly becomes rivals with - James \\"Sully\\" Sullivan, already something of a celebrity as he comes from a long line of famous scarers.  They are the classic odd couple.  Mike is manic, nerdy and a control-freak, while Sully is the MU equivalent of a legacy/jock: laid-back, over-confident and content to coast on his reputation.  How they go from being bitter rivals who can't stand each other to being an inseparable team is the rest of the movie.<br /><br />It all flows well enough, but time and again I found myself realizing that I'd seen it all before, many times. Mike's life-forming childhood experience was drawn from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The fraternity parts were drawn from Revenge of the Nerds. Sully and Mike's odd-couple bickering-to-bonding plot was a well-worn formula from any number of buddy movies. Even the best new character, the highly intimidating Dean Hardscrabble (imperiously voiced by the inimitable Helen Mirren), was strongly derivative, down to the expression and even body language, of the Grand Councilwoman from Lilo & Stitch. About the most original thing in MU was how Randy (voiced once again by Steve Buscemi) was taken from actually being a meek bespectacled nice-guy anxious to make friends and turned into the vicious underhanded nemesis Mike and Sully had to contend with in Monsters, Inc.<br /><br />Part of the reason why Monsters University fails to reach the level of Monsters, Inc. is almost certainly due to the differences in the creative forces behind them.  MI was directed by Pete Docter (who also directed the marvelous Up and the funny short Mike's New Car and wrote not only MI but also Toy Story, Toy Story 2, WALL-E and Up).  MU on the other hand was directed by Dan Scanlon and was apparently his first feature film.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who liked Monsters, Inc. in particular and for anyone who likes well-done animation in general.  Just don't expect it to be as original as the original.ut time and again I found myself realizing that I'd seen it all before, many times.

B004P8JPS6|4.0|I finally saw the Jack Reacher movie and it was good. Now looking forward to catching up on the whole series of books. This book however was a good read for me. It wasn't too long and had its moments. Like how they are including samples of the next books at the end.
B0095P33IW|4.0|After seeing The Avengers I wanted to see Captain America's origin story. I had heard this was really good, and while I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, it didn't quite live up to the hype. The overall story was good, but it felt more like a simple lead up to The Avengers than a movie that stands on its own.

B00CL50LEC|5.0|I admit--zombies are something of interest of mine. And since &#34;Shawn of the Dead&#34; came out some years back, I haven't seen anything with real humor. (Well, &#34;Zombie Land&#34; was in the neighborhood.) Most of what's out there has been terrifying or really gorey. And there's a place for that, certainly. But this was funny and unique, and just good. OK, it was somewhat predictable, but that's OK, too! Not everything is supposed to involve melting clocks, French actors, clowns, and existentialism.<br /><br />I really loved this movie. NIcholas Hoult is a favorite of mine, ever since &#34;About a Boy.&#34; He's terrific. And Teresa Palmer is more than just a pretty face--she's a fine actress with not enough recognition.<br /><br />I also find it interesting that there seems to be a subtle message about love and acceptance that we could all stand to hear nowadays.
B000021YQV|5.0|I love this album!!! When Chop Suey came out in the radio I really liked it and it was different type of music. I recently heard the song again on the radio and I decided to purchase the album to see what I missed out over the years. This album is soo incredible!From the lyrcis to the music. I seriously listen to this album everyday. When I get a ready for work and when I am in the shower. My favorite song from this album is &#34;Shimmy&#34;. Its a short song but has a lot of rhythm. Highly recommend this album!!

I would not say this is the only resource or personality test out there though.

That was squee.<br /><br />Say what you will about what Steven Moffat did with recent seasons of Doctor Who, he is still capable of creating perfectly brilliant, boyish characters who stand apart from simple humans and who make us swoon over their cleverness.<br /><br />If David Tennant was your Doctor, there is every possibility that Benedict Cumberbatch will be your Sherlock. And if you don't know the Doctor from a Raxacoricofallapatorian, that might not matter. My dad was always a Basil Rathbone guy until he saw this series.
B0000DJZB9|5.0|Welcome to the Videos by Guns and Roses, well really Axl Rose's performance in front of the Camera is an amazing show in itself.  Of course the Video is the Bands performances that would warrant keeping around, I'm sure there are more!  This is an Amazing Show.  I came along long before Guns and Roses and was not privy to their shows and never went to see them live.  I would say, I'd never been a adamant fan by any standard.  I am now.  Axy Rose is old and Fat now, probably barely alive compared to what he could do in his prime.  One cannot burn their candle at both ends without costing themselves something.  Some in the trade die long before they should and he surely will pass before he should and we wish he could at least stay viable while we see him still around.  Saul Hudson, better known by his nickname Slash, is still kicking around and one of the best of his profession, as is Jeffrey Dean Isbell, known by his stage name Izzy Stradlin, Michael Andrew &#34;Duff&#34; McKagan and at this writing as far as I know, Steven Adler also.  This is a wonderful DVD showing the talents of the Band.
B005ER6SNM|4.0|This is not an easy film to watch. Reading any number of reviews on this film will tell you that. I definitely can't say I was disappointed in finding this film. I was looking for disturbing and difficult to watch, and that's what I found. If that's what you're looking for than this is the movie to watch. However if you can't stomach something like A Clockwork Orange, don't even bother. A lot of people like calling it mindless tripe and nothing more than shock value horror, but I disagree. There are messages to be found in the film, though I think the main directors point was lost. The point was to show the climate of Serbia, it's financial issues and all that, but I just wasn't getting any of that at all. For the main family being poor they sure had a pretty nice home. Again, if you're just looking for demented and disturbing this is the way to go. Very well acted and directed, and even some kind of message in there...somewhere.
