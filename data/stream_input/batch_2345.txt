B004GHNIRK|5.0|Quick Delivery! Excellent seller! Item in Perfect Condition.<br />These are a must read for any age or any gender!<br />Great story lines and you will definitely have your favorite character!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A must read! Can't wait for the movie to come out! I couldn't put the book down! I would dream about it!
B005KR6OB2|5.0|Very Quick Delivery! item in Perfect Condition!<br />We love this series!! Great music, stories and I want that Black car!<br />Very good story lines and unexpected turns and twists in the series!<br />A must see!!! Definitely not a chick flick. We did not get to see Dean and Sam on TV very often<br />so I got the series all together and spent a whole weekend glued to the TV!<br />I am on season 5 right now... and loving it!!<br />I have already got the rest of the series on preorder!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A must read! I cannot wait til the movie comes out. Talk about triggering the sexual senses! Men could benefit from this as well as women!
B0095P31L6|5.0|The animation is amazing, the characters are original and yet familiar at the same time.<br />Watch all the different creatures in the background. Really well done.<br />You'll see pieces of all your favorite westerns, all the oater cliches but so much fun.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I knew of John Green from the Crash Course videos he hosts on YouTube.  I ventured around some more on the official channel, vlogbrothers, and discovered about his work as a novelist, specifically about this book.  I bought it on a whim.<br /><br />And I loved it.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is one of the funniest, saddest, most emotional, and any other cliched adjective I could possibly think of, books I have ever enjoyed reading.  I went into this book blind to what the actual tale told.  I was clung to every page, ensnared in the world of Hazel, the 16 year old protagonist of the story.  I recommend this book to anyone with a fleeting interest in this novel.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The separation of the classes but the commonality of their existence.The characters are very developed ,there are none that you don't care about, whether lovable, ornery or dispicable. I'm addicted!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive. You will play this game for hours, probably make your girlfriend or wife feel neglected. Missions are fun, and the hover boards available are cool. Hours of fun.
B00114RKT8|5.0|Excellent movie.  Well done.  Powerful.  Classic good vs evil. Great message about having the courage to stand up for what you believe is right even if it goes against the tide of culture and you feel you are alone in the battle. Would watch it again.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Great movie for a great price. Came in good condition.
B003L0V758|5.0|O.M.G. This is my first album from Janelle Monae, and it just floored me. Her voice just warmed up my heart, struck me with energy and empowered my mind. She exhibits her many talents in this album and makes it evident how passionate, creative, and confident she is in her music. Every song is different and touches you in a different way. She created a story about a female robot who falls in love. It's thrilling, emotional, and entertaining. Buy it! Explore and appreciate her talent :) you won't regret it!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I love this game because it's free,and  you can play for hours at a time and still have fun.  But it takes forever to get the updates that the Google and Apple app stores have.
1575666286|4.0|I purchased this book to couple it with the documentary The Gerson Miracle. I wanted it for the recipes in it and to have on hand to share with family and friends. I've already been sharing the information that it contains. If you know better you can do better. Knowledge is power.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|We wish that we had read the book 40 years ago! It is mind changing, eye opening, marriage saving! Can't say enough positive things about it.
1476733953|5.0|Hugh Howey is an excellent storyteller.  I love the Wool series and am happy I was lucky enough to stumble across this author.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent. Tells the truth, from someone who was there during Operation: Neptune Spear. Not to mention, Neptune Spear took place on my birthday!
B0000AFX64|5.0|I love it.  Because it shows how the story and series got started.  The action and the cast members are perfect.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh. Howet demonstrates the unique ability to compell the reader to voraciously consume the pages in order to see where this story goes, if there is hope, and if this unlikely heroic character - like  the heroine in the Hunger Games trilogy - will survive. While the setting of &#34;Wool&#34; isn't pleasant, it's the image we can foresee of the not-too-distant future and it should give the reader pause for this result. The book grabs you from the first page.
B004P8A7J2|2.0|Although Ellen Burstyn is one of my favorite actors, this dreary film plodded along without any sympathies for any of the characters.
B00821OX98|4.0|I do not enjoy a show unless the characters are people I can relate to. These characters are good. Well played.
B00BJA2VFW|2.0|After the first few boards its pretty repetitious and boring. Little variation involved.Not much else to say. Will not recommend.
B001E45XT4|3.0|The sound is good, the microphone is clear and tucks away, and they are comfortable. However, my wife and I have gone through four of these. The different pieces of the headband are held together with roughly an inch of plastic that lacks any sort of reinforcement. This coupled with the location causes the joint to take direct pressure when you pull the speakers away from each other, e.g., the act of putting them on or taking them off. Even with the slightest amount of pull you can see that they are not moving as a singular piece. I was extremely careful with this last pair; while it lasted longer than the previous it eventually weakened and snapped. That being said, if I could find a way to reinforce them to prevent this breakage I would be more than willing to buy another pair.<br /><br />I added a picture to showcase the issue.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I actually had the Plantronics GameCom 377 not the 367. However, I felt this was relevant since the only difference between the two headsets is the plastic that covers the holes changing them from \\"open-ear\\" to \\"closed-ear\\".
1612680402|5.0|It's worth investing in this book<br />I got it on time<br />Arrived in right time<br />I recommend this book '
0812452240|2.0|I foolishly didn't look at the dimensions. This &#34;hardcover&#34; is the size of a small paperback.....why would someone make/want this? In the same order I bought the excellent edition on hardcover of Nightshift.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|El libro presenta casos reales. Me gusto mucho la manera como abordan los diferentes temas. Es una lectura sencilla y muy amigable.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What is not to like about one of the best series that has ever been on broadcast television?  It you haven't yet seen the series, what the Hell are you waiting for?!
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Really good show! Keeps you hooked. Story is consistent with the movies. Computer animation is surprisingly good for a TV show.
B009FZFONO|3.0|I felt that season three was just OK.  For a bunch of people sitting around in a prison with little else to do, we had a bare minimum of real character development through the season.  Sure there were some great moments, but there were spread too far apart and the pacing at the end of the season dragged on, and then disappointed.
B000AO4NJA|5.0|I am really enjoying this CD. If you want to have Sam Cooke in your record collection this is a good album to buy.  Unfortunately, it does not include his last solo hit, \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\", But it does include all his other major hits. I recommend it highly!!
B000FC146C|5.0|I read this in high school and loved it.  Now I'm in my 60's and I still loved it. It is for all ages.
0060557818|5.0|This book is at time hilarious and heart rending and fun to read.  I have to write seven more words.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|I could not understand this.  The reading was too hard for me.  I might try again after I see the move.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|A joy for any DC fan. Once you watch this show you will be hooked, this show delivers the action and entertainment expected
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Easy to follow the time line. Very informative. Great acting. We enjoyed the movie very much. Is as real as they get.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. But however it does need to be updated so we have more stuff like the computer version of this.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very enjoyable, the instant video worked well. I could watch it when I had time.  I liked the historical view.
B00005UNCL|2.0|This movie is really, really bad.<br /><br />The acting is horrific, the action scenes are boring and unscary but most importantly; there is no plot!<br /><br />I do not understand this movie at all.  To me and to a lot of people, it just is a big mess in order to make money.<br /><br />In my opinion, they should never have made a sequel.  The original is amazing while this one is horrible.<br /><br />In conclusion, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a very bad movie and is not worth your time of day.<br /><br />I do not recommend this movie.
B008BR3QOQ|5.0|What's not to love by Chris Robinson???  The music is ridiculous and leaves you wanting more. Another solid album that should be in everyone's collection
B00B4804KS|5.0|I recently attended the 3D premiere of Jurassic Park.  I absolutely loved it.  The 3D makes you feel like you are really there!  The dinos even jump in your face!<br /><br />3D has made a great film even greater then it was before.  The 3D adds depth which you can't see in 2D.<br /><br />Even if you have this movie in 2D, go see it again!  This film was made for the big screen.  Especially in 3D.  If you can't make it out to the theatre but you have a 3D TV, then buy this by all means!<br /><br />I recommend this movie.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|Looks very clean. Sound is crisp and clear. Colors are vibrant! Love every minute of it!<br />I would recommend revisiting the Original series. Eye candy for fans!
B0013UIUBC|5.0|The story is one of love and redemption.  His love is given because he sees the worth of who she is and honors this in showing his love and patience towards her.  She finally gets it and lets him into her heart.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Everyone seemed to be watching & loving Downton Abbey so curiosity got to me, loved it! You quickly understand who's who & with the exception of 2 characters, why they all think & perform as they do....can't wait for the 3rd season!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|we love this series and cannot get enough of the great acting and excellent writing of a household of period drama.
0345803507|4.0|Only just now finishing the first book in the trilogy ... what is there to say about Christian that none of us doesn't already know, at least if we're females ... :).  Arrived from the seller timely and was packaged well.  I guess from the sound of it, one might say the same about Christian ...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I waited until all of Season 3 was available for purchase and then I had a Downton Abbey marathon weekend!  The acting and costuming were superb.  I was hoping that everyone would live happily ever after.  You won't want to miss a single season of Downton Abbey.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|If I had time to tell you the pros and cons of this film, then, I would.  Simply put, this is a must have for purchase, and The Life Of Pi is worth every dollar of purchase.  You will make a fine investment in purchasing this classic.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|Chances are, you're already a fan of HoGaB Pt. 1 if you're reading this review. I can tell you for certain that this album goes above and beyond the already amazing beginning to this story. As a whole, double concept albums have not held a great reputation. Corey Tayor and Co. have in my opinion set new standards to how a dual album should pan out.<br /><br />Starting with the intense build-up of \\"Red City\\", this track without a doubt sets the tone for the rest of the album. Yes it is darker, however you're always able to see the silver lining in the clouds and hope within.<br /><br />\\"Black John\\" is a song about one of the antagonists of the story. Its an excellent track with some amazing drumming and of course the catchy chorus Stone Sour almost always delivers.<br /><br />\\"Sadist\\" is one of the darker, yet not heavier, tracks on the album. Amazing singing by Corey, you can feel the emotion he is portraying from the point of view from the protagonist of the story.<br /><br />\\"Peckinpah\\" is definitely a stand-out track to me. The build-up to the chorus is absolutely intense!! The blast beats of the drums mixed with Mr. Taylor's aggressive vocals that deliver us into a clean and emotional chorus blow me away every time I hear it.<br /><br />\\"Stalemate\\" to me compares with the likes of the tune \\"Tired\\" from part one. It most definitely sounds to me like the most radio-friendly song on the  album. Its not to say that its a bad song by any means, but it probably stands out the least of all the others to me.<br /><br />\\"Gravesend\\" sounds like old Stone Sour in the fact of its sheer heaviness and dark undertones. This probably has to be the darkest songs on the album. The lyrics are what makes it though. The story alone in this song alone tells us the battle of good and evil our protagonist faces.<br /><br />\\"'82\\" is also one of the more radio-friendly tracks on the album. This one stands out to me more than \\"Stalemate\\" does. The guitar work is top notch and the chorus is absolutely astounding. It isn't at all a dark song, it conveys more hope and positivity than any other on the album.<br /><br />\\"The Uncanny Valley\\" sounds like one of the more experimental tracks. The guitar work sound like nothing you've heard on a Stone Sour album thus far.<br /><br />\\"Blue Smoke\\" serves as a creepy and forbearing intermission and a perfect intro track to our next song.<br /><br />\\"Do Me a Favor\\" is something I'm sure you all have heard by now. You know it's already a blasting mad tune. I didn't much care for it at first, but it is now one of my top tracks by this band.<br /><br />\\"The Conflagration\\" is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard before. Starting with just piano and drums mixed with Corey Taylors' amazing voice, this song unfolds into the best track on this album. I am personally not the biggest fan of their slower songs and ballads, but this one without a doubt is the golden child.<br /><br />\\"The House of Gold and Bones\\" is a grand finale indeed. Starting with the chant, \\"RU486\\" which I'm sure you're familiar with, this song has everything and more in it that you love in Stone Sour. Aggression, catchy chorus, a great solo, and overall amazing quality are the best words I can use to describe it.<br /><br />All in all, get this album right now. You have my word that if you're already a huge fan of Corey Taylor, then this album will not disappoint you. The real treat for me was the way that certain songs link directly back to some that are on the first part. I'll leave it to you to find which ones they are. You'll be grinning from ear to ear when you discover them.<br /><br />I hope you all enjoy this as much as I did.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I love ghost stories and shows. This show keeps you guessing who the ghost are and who are still alive. It goes like that all season, you really don't find out till the last show.
0064431622|3.0|I picked this book up for my boys after enjoying many of Eric Carle's books.  It's still in our library (unlike the Grouchy Ladybug), but my boys don't gravitate towards it.  Being an adult I can pick up on the \\"be yourself\\" message, but it's a bit muddled for them (1 yr. & 4 yrs).  They like the colors and of course the artwork is beautiful, as Carle's books always are.  Check this one out from the library before making a purchase.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|teach us about human nature in an exaggerated form so that it is scary<br />and funny but not trite.  And since it is make-believe, we can immerse<br />without carrying an anxiety hang-over when we've finished viewing.<br />May friend and I often have deep discussions about the meaning of life<br />following an episode.
0811879542|4.0|A friend purchased this for my 1 year old.  It's quite a bit above his head, but my 4 year old *adores* it.  He already loves to read, but the idea of a book being interactive completely blew his mind.  He can't put it down.  I'd give it 5 stars if the construction were a bit sturdier.  If kids are supposed to push, shake and stand it up, it needs to be able to withstand more than your average book.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I got this app and it was working fine until today and I kept pulling it up and it would stay on the starting up screen then goes back to my main menu. This is very annoying because this is a fun game!
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Steven Wilson continues to outdo himself. Touches of old prog rock throughout. His backing band is fantastic. Looking forward to his US tour.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This Lincoln movie is so well done.  The acing, and writing were superb !!!  I would recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun little game that is enjoyed by young and old alike.  My 4 year old grandson loves it, and it fascinates my Ph.D. husband!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was a great book. I truly enjoyed reading it. Got me from the first page, the way it was written was cleverly done. I  can't wait to see the movie, but I don't see how they will be able to express all his thoughts.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|I love adam sandler he is one of my favorite actors! im also a big fan of cg animation films and the two put together was just a masterpiece! This went on my top ten favorite cg animation films list!
B001NHNG64|4.0|This is an excellent series about a former military man righting wrongs wherever he finds them.  He is larger than life, my kind of hero.  Along the way, there is always a girl and they have a fling and he moves on because that is who he is.  Villains are colorful and evil.  Maybe Lee Child will marry him off some day.
0679746048|5.0|much better than the film, as someone who suffers from bpd myself i found it insightful and interesting, would recommend to others
0547848412|3.0|Took me at least 100 pages to get into it.  Thought it was a bit weird at first, but then it grew on me.  Enjoyed it in the end.  It<br />spurred me on to watch the movie which I also enjoyed.
B00AHXIC50|3.0|I thought the CD had some hits and some misses... Just Okay, not great. The ballards were the best part of  the CD
0345529057|5.0|Started this series 3 weeks ago and have already read the first 3 books!  If you love good old fashioned adventure coupled with some romance you will love this series.  Very medieval based, but with an element of fantasy thrown in.  Read the books then watch the HBO series!
B007R3AZNK|5.0|This guy is the new Stevie Ray Vaughn combined with Jesse Cook and other superb &#34;pickers&#34;.<br />He's unique and I want more every time I play his music.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|had a glitch with the game yesterday. todayit has been working great. fun all day long.  I enjoy sensitive gifts to my friends.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|I don't normally care for Live recordings (clapping, audience noise) but how can you go wrong with Frank and the Count?
B005DF2QMC|2.0|The Writing and the Illustration on the Instruction  Manual is to hard to read, the<br />Writing is to small, I can not read it with out a  Magnifying glass. Even so it is hard  to make out.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a very fun game to pass away the time while your sitting around waiting at the Doctors office.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I enjoyed the story, the characters, the mosaic presentation of India, the look inside the lives of seniors whose &#34;golden years&#34; turn out to be quite different from their expectations and what they do to live with it.
1452113432|5.0|I enjoy watching Rachel  Khoo's Little Paris videos on YouTube, and was so excited to see her cookbook being offered here.  You can watch her make many of the recipes in the book on those videos.  Love her, and her tiny little kitchen helps me like my small kitchen too.
B000683VI4|2.0|This story was told primarily in flashbacks of an elderly man looking back on the romance of the love of his life, his wife, after she entered a nursing home.  It did not translate well to film.
B00B6ELPIU|5.0|Tooth for an Eye, Full of Fire and some of the more accessible tracks take off right where Silent Shout or Deep Cuts left off, but the swirling ambient textures in the other larger tracks are much more. These tracks fill you with wonder, dread and triumph all at once. The world is a scary place and The Knife is making the soundtrack for it.<br /><br />If you only like The Knife for Heartbeats or We Share Our Mothers Health, you probably won't like this. If the pictures of The Knife in primate masks or melting face masks seem pretentious, wankish or overdone, than you'll loathe this. No doubt about it... it's a big album. Long, deep, and dark. The accompanying manifesto should have clued you in on that.<br /><br />At some points it's challenging to take. Other times, they feed you the answers on a beat heavy platter.<br /><br />I'll take what they are dishing out. The world needs more music like this.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|These deeply engrossing plots and sub-plots make one want to ask for more!  Having the actual collection give additional commentaries and an insider's view of costumes, histories, etc.  It is well worth it to buy the set.
B008OURHPY|5.0|What a powerful soulful voice. Its one of the few 'albums' I can listen to from beginning to end. I'm grateful she made the leap to believe and walk the life of an artist.
B007A2O3FO|3.0|A young man comes to live in the country during the war torn days of bombing in London and finds more people living within the walls of the mansion than meets the eye.
B00BI745AA|5.0|With this all star cast you can't go wrong.  Loved the movie and feel that although most of the actors are not trained singers they did a great job overall.  Certainly will bring tears to your eyes. Plan to purchase this DVD to add to our collection.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Maggie Smith shone in this story of a typical hunting weekend in a mansion in the English countryside.  Layered between the lives of the bluebloods and the servants below stairs are sub-plots and red herrings, as the hunting weekend becomes a multi-layered murder mystery.<br />The only down side of the movie was that the director, Robert Altman, had enough F-words sprinkled in it to earn an R rating, which did absolutely nothing to improve the story (made it more offensive) because, he said, he did not want teenage boys to be able to watch it at the theaters, since he didn't think they would understand or catch all of the subtle nuances.  Too bad!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Please, oh please, relieve our suffering and give us our fix. I thought i was addicted to Madmen until I met Homeland. It is as T bone steaks to filet mignon. What complexity and surprise in the script! What acting by all the principals! What lessons about the brilliance of a mind diseased: Carrie's by mental illness and the terrorists by ideological insanity.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|Merle Streep did a great job, but there were some disappointing aspects of the film.  It seemed that more emphasis was made on Mrs. Thatcher's old-age dementia than was necessary; this should have been a story of her life as a political ruler and the great impact she had on Britain's history.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Just when her studies would indicate that introverts were superior & I got to feeling really good about being one, she'd present the other side of the study showing that extraverts had alternative skills. And then I'd be back to square one... wishing I'd been born more of an extravert. Actually tho, introverts do have a lot to offer & it was helpful having it all summarized in this book.
6304698690|3.0|The classic story, A Secret Garden, features Maggie Smith as a very likeable Mrs. Medlock, the stern housekeeper of this gloomy mansion in Yorkshire England.  All versions that I have seen have been good, but Maggie Smith portrayed her as having more heart than most.
B002QCD2QO|1.0|I heard the old one was okay, but this was awful, boring confusing ridiculous scripting, your typical strange 70s movie
B00003CX9W|5.0|Only Walt Disney could have presented a collection of classical music in such a way that one would want to view this again and again.  It is an essential part to a DVD library.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|My brother had this game on his phone. I was hooked after 5 min. Downloaded the full version on my kindle fire hd. Love this game. I can't put it down its sooo addicting. Even when I lose, I just want to play it more.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am not a tv watcher but i love this series. I always look forward to seeing more episodes. Keep them coming.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Surprised at how well it was done, even down to the lighting.  Tackled issues that are not generally known.  Enjoyed it.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|didn't download well.  graphics spotty.  slow and choppy in play.<br />Perhaps i should have read further before deciding to obtain it?<br />Just not my favorite type of game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best in the whole universe. My sister really enjoys this game. Every time I look around she is in my face saying \\"Can I play Subway Surfers on your tablet?\\". This game is for people who love to have fun surfing the trains!
B0091REZMW|5.0|It is very entertaining.  Challenging and makes you think. I would highly recomend this game.  I wouldn't mind another game to play that is similar.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Jam to the music all day at work. Great Album every single song is awesome. Definetly a must buy for everyone!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I recently got into this show and loved the first two seasons, but season 3 is even more intense than before!  I love the story and the characters.  Can't wait for season 4!!
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Perfect.  Great price good movie worked great couldnd be happier.  Loved the movie and the price.  Order here worth it !!!
B00BVVA138|5.0|KsE are BACK! this album is amazing! Melodic and heavy as few expected including myself after that dissapointing 2009 self titled album. Jesse Leach is a total BEAST on vocals. this has to be the band's best work in years since their 2002 Alive or Just Breathing master piece release. I highly recommend to the true fans who appreciate the Raw sound and lyrics that early KSE delivered. 5 stars!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|It is an enjoyable chronicle with a good lead in to the upcoming movies.  Will wait for the rest of the story.
B001KZVQJI|3.0|First the good:<br />It's great to see the the Extended edition of this movie (in HD by the way) and not have to change the disc out half way through the movie. The picture quality is super clear and crisp, and the presentation is fantastic. This is obviously a movie that was made to be seen in HD, and it couldn't look better.<br /><br />Now the bad:<br />The director's commentary with Peter Jackson and Phillipa Boyens is exactly the same as it was on the DVD version of this movie. Doesn't sound bad right? Well I mean that literally; its EXACTLY the same. Including the point where Peter Jackson tells you &#34;this is the end of commentary on the first disc,&#34; and a few seconds later starts with &#34;welcome back to the commentary, I hope you had some time to fix yourself a cup of tea...&#34; Truthfully, this isn't really all that bad, and I didn't expect them to record a new commentary for a re-release of the film on home video. But it is kind of weird to hear this knowing you don't have to change the disc. I suppose they could have re-editing the audio so that they cut this stuff out but then there would have been a long silence in between the scenes so, really, it's not that big of a problem.<br /><br />Now for the bad, no seriously this is bad:<br />If you owned the DVD of the extended edition of King Kong then you'll know there were a couple of hours worth of behind the scenes documentaries included. Which appear to be nowhere to be found on this Blu-Ray. What is included is something called UControl, which will display an icon during the playing of the movie which you can select and then play a little behind the scenes clip. From the 4 or 5 of these I watched, they weren't really the same as the documentaries from the DVD, which might be cool except there is no option to only play these behind the scenes clips by themselves. You have to watch the movie in order to watch these clips. I'm the kind of person likes to play behind-the-scenes stuff while I do work but this Blu-Ray would require me to pay attention to it in order to watch any of this stuff.<br /><br />So in conclusion, great HD, kind of a commentary kink, and the behind-the-scenes features are not the same and presented in a bad way.<br /><br />If you were planning on tossing your DVD copy of the movie and replacing it with this Blu-Ray, think twice because it is not a perfect HD replacement.but this Blu-Ray would require me to pay attention to it in order to watch any of this stuff.<br /><br />So in conclusion, great HD, kind of a commentary kink, and the behind-the-scenes features are not the same and presented in a bad way.<br /><br />If you were planning on tossing your DVD copy of the movie and replacing it with this Blu-Ray, think twice because it is not a perfect HD replacement.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I wondered how they were going to pull it off, but in the very beginning they were able to slide away from Jason Bourne and into the Aaron Cross character with ease.  The rest is all &#34;Bourne&#34; in style and action.  Loved it....
B009LREA1S|5.0|I have always been a fan of the Batman! Since I was a little girl I've enjoyed the TV shows now the franchise movies as an adult. This movie was awesome. The villian was exceptional. Mr. Bale was great and it was a real treat to see Anne Hathaway as Catwoman. A list actors 5 star performances.
B0044IABFS|5.0|I loved this series, I remember when it first started and my daughter was hooked on it, I didn't think I would like it.  Then it came to Amazon Prime and I fell in love with it.....okay lots of holes in the plot and lots of issues with logic, but it is still a good watch.
B005OP821K|5.0|I was wary of Revenge at first but the show quickly turned into a constant guilty pleasure of mine. Keep up the good work!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie was well crafted, the cast was phenomenal, everything about it was timed perfectly!  A well deserved hit and very deserving of the Oscar, too bad Ben was not recognized as an award winning direct by the Academy!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|love it...monkeys are fun......i like it better than the original because of all the bright colors ..get it..trust me....yeahhhh baby
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My son says he loves it because of the challenges.  He enjoys unlocking the people.  Both my kids spend lots of time playing.
030746363X|5.0|I've been toying with this book for a few years now and thought it time I give a little update on my trials and tribulations.  My background: I grew up in a gym, son of a bodybuilding gym owner (who got 2nd place in CA many years ago), obsessed with the science behind hypertrophy-specific training, and addict to self-improvement.<br /><br />First, I'd like to comment on the area I know the most about.  His section on adding muscle is awesome.  Before reading this book, I trained 3 friends over a span of 6 weeks based on hypertrophy-specific training principles (search the terms in google and read the studies and testimonials of the followers). Two of the the trainees gained over 30lbs and the remaining trainee gained 25 lbs.  So, I took it upon myself to test the principles of the \\"Geek to Freak\\" section.  I worked out only 4 times for a total of 3 hours in 3 weeks and put on over 20 lbs.  So far, so good.<br /><br />As for the section on sleep, I did a massive research paper on this in college.  I wish there would have been more info in this section, but the book is already massive and gives you the keys to unlock enough doors to keep you body-busy for a LONG, LONG time.  Also, I see that other reviewers aren't understanding what I felt to be the greatest part of this book.  I've been testing these principles over the last 2 years, and am now in love with the idea of mental and physical health again.  By the way, check out Claudio Stampi's research on polyphasic sleeping<br /><br />Next, I tell my roommate about the slow-carb diet to lose weight.  We also discuss kettlebell swings.  After one month, he loses 20 lbs.  I also just found out my neighbor across the street is down 9 lbs in a month on the slow-carb diet.<br /><br />In the later part of 2012, my friend and I visit our first ART (active release technique) specialist and he leaves in the best physical condition of his life.  My friend is on the USA Rugby team and just won the plate in the Tokyo Rugby Sevens.<br /><br />The proof is in the pudding folks.  This book really does give a great insight into so many different areas of the body.  I didn't even include some of the other fun areas, but think you should pick up a copy for yourself and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.  I cant imagine being able to get through this last grueling year of work without being able to wind down and figure out my next 4 hour body adventure.  Cheers Tim
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|We liked this movie.  A little too scary for 10 and under.  Overall this was an entertaining movie and I would recommend it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|loved this book and did not want it to end. Grissom had a terrific story to tell, her characters came alive. A great read.
B004KZOXJA|5.0|this story really keeps you entertained all the way to the very last page. The descriptive narrative that Lauren uses in describing how her characters are feelings and then reacting is enchanting. I stumbled across it on an Amazon recommendation and read the first one. Afterwards I researched the book online and found that there is a huge fan base for this series in the states with it reaching epic proportions even going to far as creating merchandise for it. I really hope that this is made into a movie because I think if they did it right it could really be the next big teen sensation.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Rereading this classic brought me back to the love of reading of my youth.  Story is so uplifting and encouraging.
B001DM1VXE|5.0|I wasn't sure if I'd like this movie, but I was captivated immediately.  The photography is stunning. The story line is fascinating.  All of the scenes are very realistic.<br /><br />This movie is not for young children as several scenes involve animal violence.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Show is well-written, perfectly cast, and addictive. Characters are well-developed, and the storyline is interesting and dramatic. I watched the entire season over a long weekend! You won't be disappointed.
B00001OH7N|5.0|I am a huge Bowie fan, but had never had this particular album on vinyl.  I think it is one of his better albums.
B005HI4LLY|4.0|this was a movie that was picked by mistake but at the end it turned out to be a good one to make
B00001OH7O|5.0|This album, along with the Man Who Sold the World, is a great, creative time for Bowie.  This is one of my favorites of his work.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|what more can be said, true story, non stop action now on blue ray, a cant go wrong movie for the price
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is good for my child she loves this game. This game is awesome now it is giving me 5 thousand stars!
B005J4TLQG|5.0|a movie that should have been leaked to the states a long time ago, funny and worth the few bucks it cost
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I found the book very interesting, and even actionable, but there were parts that were long and repetitive. Overall, this book is definitely worth your time.
6305090564|5.0|old movie that i can watch over and over..hard to find classic! for the price you just cant go wrong.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|If your like me and you need another epic entanglement of delicious stories with deep and thought-provoking characters than look no further. All the intricacies and highly developed imagination that a sci-fi adventure needs with none of the cheesy moments.
B0089OBLDO|4.0|I'm only gonna be talking about console portion to this adapter because that is mostly what I would use it for.  Here's what I think:    PROS:  Good Cheap Price  It does what its tended to do  Universal which is always a plus(Sorry PC?)  Great for XBOX controllers and Xbox 3rd Party Controllers  Will work with official Sony PS3 Brand Controllers  Fairly long Cord  Works with THE HORI FIGHTING EDGE Arcade Stick(360 Version)!  No Lag/Latency!    CONS:  Sony PS3 3rd party Controllers  Wireless controllers not compatible(unless its the Sony PS3 brand one but you need to keep it connected Via USB at all times)    MOSTLY TALK ABOUT ARCADE STICK USE:  I've been wanting to get an adapter for my Arcade stick. So I ended up getting this one. I was interested in getting myself a Hori Fighting Edge arcade stick. Because I play in a Fighting Game Community, we tend to have local tournaments. Tournament standards in my area consist of playing on Playstation 3. We do have local modders in my area that can mod your stick for you so you can play on xbox/ps3. But I didn't want to do that for my Hori Fighting Edge because since its a new take on an arcade stick with a touch panel I was worried that the modding wouldn't go well. So before buying that stick I had to make sure that the adapter would work. So I ended up buying this before getting the stick. A friend of mine had a PS3 version of the stick and so I tested the adapter with it. To no avail it didn't work. I ended up getting the xbox version and figured I would just buy another stick which would be PS3 at a later time when I would have more money. One night I decided to try it out on the 360 version of the stick. IT WORKED! Later I ended up finding out that this Adapter tends to favor most if any all Xbox controllers/xbox 3rd party controllers. But not the other way around. But that doesn't apply to All 360 arcade sticks in general. Pretty much all I can say its a Hit or miss. But most 360 Mad Catz / Hori arcade stick Models work with the adapter. Not really sure about the PS3 Mad Catz / Hori sticks. So in short, Your better off going from Xbox to PS3 rather then PS3 to Xbox.    I did manage to try it with regular controller pads. It works fine but it needs to be Corded. Wireless is a no go. I was playing on my PS3 with my corded xbox 360 controller. Vice Versa if you want to play on a Sony PS3 controller to XBOX 360 you have to authenticate it first.    If you guys want a Video Reference on this Product, a youtuber by the name of SatoshiMATRIX1 made a video about it. [...]
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|There is no real plot, nor is it a complete memoir.  It bounces around in the story of her life but o real continuity.  She probably doesn't care.  She knows her Palin [sic] imitation is the high of her career as the whole book seems to lead up to that.  There are some hysterical lines that keep the reader moving on.  Not great literature, for sure.
B00AKFG15S|3.0|Having enjoyed the first two of the series I found this a let down and never anticipated it would be leading to a further edition - which I very much doubt I will purchase.
B00935KWWO|5.0|This is a great app. Notifications are timely and especially enjoy all of the choices it offers you when you click on the link.<br />I highly recommend it to anyone.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Brilliantly written with so many twists and turns. Keeps you on the edge of your seat with fantasically unlikeable main characters! this is definitely a 'must read'. Depicts the ugliest parts of the human psyche and yet we are rooting for one of these people by the end. a real psychological drama. Concentrate hard as you read though because there are so many small yet important details. Don't want to give away too much of the story but begins with a husband discovering the disappearance of his wife but this is so much more than a 'whodunnit'. By the end we do not know who is good and who is evil. Can't wait to read this author's other works
B00BI73CVI|4.0|When I saw the previews, I said oh boy a musical, so I thought it would be like Grease and Moulin Rouge. There is singing in the movie but there is also people talking which is what i like. But this is singing throughout the movie no talking what so ever. Because with some of singing I really couldn't understand what they were saying. But the acting and the movie itself was great. BUt I won't be buying or seeing this movie again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So much more than what I expected! So easy to get into and once you are in you are done!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have just started playing and it seems of great fun. but there are many games to unlocked. they could at least give more free games.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I loved the book, I actually stayed up all night reading it the day it came into my possession, The movie def. upheld its end of the deal
B0052AC8C6|5.0|his show was not for children alone. here was plenty of adult content with excellent writing. he characters were very real and so funny.  I liked the story line and there was enough adult content to keep to keep it interesting. Very much like an old western. I would recommend  this film and watch it again.
B009GED3HS|4.0|not as good as other seasons, but I still really enjoy it. def. a good purchase. not upset at all.
B008602KQI|5.0|I don't know if I've ever seen a movie that truly rivals the book. This one comes close for me. Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing actress and is supported by an equally awesome cast. I love seeing the book come to life this way. It is very close to what went on in my imagination while reading.
B0064UPU4G|5.0|Really unique style!  I like their electronic sound and grooves, and their use of depth in volume and the use of frequency envelopes to make sounds distant and close.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Loved Ender's Game, this was a great follow up. Just started the third in the series. If you like si-fi, give this a try.
B000BOGB30|5.0|Since I never read the novel and only saw the movies I wanted to read the originals. I loved it even as an adult. sweet story.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|All good.
B0063M22QO|1.0|I did not like this game and so I returned it and received my money back.  Too simple and not challenging at all.
1616550414|5.0|I've always loved legend of zelda. the story is amazing and there a so many mysteries. this book help me solve some. like in the hyrulian symbol the thing that looks like a bird represents a loftwing. so cool
B008S4YZCO|4.0|I know this game would be awesome, but it glitches all the time :(. Its hard to actually enjoy the game cause it mini freezes a lot. I'm gonna try to free up some space and see if its my device b/c I really want to enjoy this game...glitch free :). If its not my device...please please fix.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This games graphic are good. And it doesn't buffer when I turn. So that is why I say it is amazing
B00985E3UG|4.0|I was raised believing food is my friend, that nutrition was it's purpose. Sadly, SSF shows us quite the opposite, that food has, in the interests of profit (read Wall Street here) become yet another means to manipulate people for corporate self interest. Doesn't it say something that those who created this mess won't eat it themselves? We should take their example to heart and not eat such PT (Processed Trash) either. Long live SSF and its kin.
B008E9R6RE|3.0|The action on Arrakis was the best part of this entire trilogy for me, but there's so much expository text and constantly repeated backstory that cumulatively I began to feel as if the authors were either (A) filling pages to meet some imagined benchmark, or (B) treating me, as a reader  like an idiot who could not remember what he'd read 50 pages previously. I found myself skipping huge swathes of text until I got to the next bit of (fairly predictable) action.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Ms. McKenna is an excellent writer and the story flowed. The ending has a twist...a sweet one. Read it ya'll
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|This game was all good, until the game uninstalled itself and I was at level ten on Tiger shark!!!! DONT GET THE GAME!!!! ITS VERY DEPRESSING :'( :'(
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Cant wait for the next one. Great movie, good dialogue and acting. A must see. Watched it twice and thoroughly enjoyed it on both occassions.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Great series for it's type. My wife and found it very entertaining as we are fond of intrigue, mystery and drama. From the perspective of entertainment, we see this series entailing very good acting, direction and script writing, and hope it continues this course with future episodes. As with any movie or series, there may be a portion of truth, fabrication, imagination, and possibilities. In the end, we ask, \\"was it entertaining?\\" For this series we wholeheartedly replied, \\"yes!\\"
B0087EVHVW|5.0|this is the secon intel core that I purchased .<br /><br />they are great quality and work with no problems. this core was used in a shuttle SFF computer, also purchased through Amazon.<br /><br />I must say the speed that I got this, and other parts needed, was quite fast.<br /><br />good value for the cost.
B0035JLVWY|4.0|Thought it was good; Gere is always suave and debonair; Like to see a sequel where he helps to prosecute the bastard.
B009EHDU7U|3.0|Fun, light hearted, interesting historical events in Allan Karlsson's life. Good to read of an older person still involved in life and having amazing experiences.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Made me feel good inside and that good will always come out a winner.<br />Recommend it to all to watch this movie.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I thought this would be better than it was. I have wtached the Ring movies and I guess I just expected too much.  Just wasn't up to standard set by the Ring movies.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Someone told me to check out Arrow.  I decided to view the pilot first.  I loved it!  I now use this pilot download as my program to watch when I am retiring for bed.  I now watch the series.
B0041VT6HW|3.0|Lots of action ,but not much of a plot. Good way to spend a boring afternoon when not much else on TV.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|My girlfriend picked this out so I figured it would be a snoozer. There was some comedy and some very good acting. Overall I can't lie I kinda liked it.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Navigation is easy. Great to use to compare prices when shopping. Has useful tools such as scanning barcodes and can quickly place orders. Sorting items and filtering helps with making decisions.
B001QPHNPS|5.0|It helps that I have some knowledge of these Rumpole stories having watched the series years ago on PBS. But once you learn the characters and the setting, these are all great stories.
B002ZG975Q|4.0|i liked the movie when it was animated bringing to life for the teenage audience was a good movie. It sounds cheesy but it shows you that love should be about who you are not what you look like.
B00BU2TEGS|4.0|This is not the best album DM has created but it is solidly done. More soulful than previous work but I attribute that to that DM, as well as those of us who have been listening since the early 80's, are getting older. I liked it very much. I will confess to a bias that has existed since 1985 when I first listened. Depeche Mode was and still is my favorite band of all time. Keep up the good work!
B0001I561E|4.0|this movie was a gift greatly enjoyed by the little one who got it.  The movie made her laugh and sigh and made her light up, which was the best gift for me.  I first saw this movie as a little girl and loved it, i was glad i could give it to her.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|It was a good movie.  Denzel Washington was good in the movie. but I didn't like seeing a pilot with a drinking problem, but I know it does happen.
B004EPZ070|3.0|the movie was funny and sweet although the ending was not what i expected and sad.  i wanted to see the John and Jennifer characters end up together not the other way around, this movie needs the sequel, &#34;Something Blue&#34; to be made.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|The movie was excellent,and  It was also visually beautiful to watch with a tiger and and boy and the way the boy became known.
B0001MLMKY|5.0|This watch it's amazing, classic, economic, I wear wekends and look great, I wan't another swatch but in other color.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This movie will make you laugh! Even if your not 40, you'll get it, I only regret I didn't buy it, cause I want to see it again now!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Fun game.  Easy to level up early, but then u need coins which are hard to come by or you have to buy them.  Daily challenges are difficult.
B002C949KE|2.0|A few interesting nuggets that I had already subconsciously identified but had not put into words - such as the different between market-type transactions and social-type transactions. but generally not worth much else.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I didn't expect to like this series of books. I bought it on a whim. I was beyond pleasantly surprised! I couldn't put them down! Really grabs you right from the start and holds you all the way to the end. Totally worth the money!
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|I expected this to be &#34;Toy Story&#34; for video games when it first started. It was a good, original story with likeable characters, though. Our whole family enjoyed it - kids are girls, ages 11 and 14. I'm sure younger kids would like it a lot, too.
0061353248|5.0|I see the world very differently now after having read this book.  There is a myth that we've accepted that we are in control of our destiny.  I personally believe in free will, but I also believe there is a lot that we think is free will, but is actually the wiring of our brains that causes us to act the way we do.  And only by recognizing the pitfalls of the human mind can we actually exercise our free will to overcome them.  I also recommend You Are Not So Smart by David McRaney for a lot more irrational things we do and why.
B0087EACJK|5.0|One of the best!<br />I like it that you you need to create a strategy as you get to the higher level.<br />Makes you think.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Timeless in many ways. Everyone should watch this film from old to young. John Hughes really nailed it with this classic, great story and great cast of young talent.
B0000AQS0F|2.0|I did not care for this movie at all and neither did any of my guests who came to see it.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Brings me great pleasure to sit down and read some Holmes with a nice cup of Earl Grey tea :)<br />Brilliant author...brilliant storylines....brilliant characters....splendid<br />Sherlock reminds me of Spock from Star Trek<br />...anyway if you want a brilliant read for a splendid deal...BUY IT
B001NLKWLW|4.0|This book kept me wondering until the end. A very good read. Morton always has a creative twist at the end; she always keeps the reader guessing. This time I had it figured out.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|This game was not good enough for my age I thought that it was not<br />Good at all for any BUY NEED FOR SPEED MOST WANTED ITS 7$$ BUT IT'S WOTH  IT
1743117094|5.0|Worth the time and the money and I will listen to it many times.  The story is timeless and as wonderful as I expected!
B00BSBXZDY|3.0|May be good for kids but not adults May be good for kids but not adults May be good for kids but not adults
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good plot with lots of twists and turns.  I liked that something new was always coming up with more challenges .
B00136NYR6|5.0|A sound that just doesn't go out of style.  Used to listen to this for hours in Greenwitch Village New York City.  Those days music was something to think about.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|It was a dark and for the most part ugly movie.  Not many uplifting moments.  I loved the The Lord of the Rings movies but I just did not like The Hobbit at all.
B0012GMUZY|5.0|One of the best of the old blues men.Listening to this album shows why.Doesn't get any better.Great guitar style and vocals.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|good gone 007 juct don't have what it takes. not fast too slow needs more muc and more ladys and more stoyer
B0000E6I1J|5.0|I saw this concert on PBS and had to get this album.His friends and family did him proud.Awesome music.Peace to George!
B00BSW6F26|3.0|It is a ok game, but I would love to see  longer games brought out that take longer to solve. So come on and bring out longer solving games.
B003Z49LYO|3.0|Was well done with good acting, but my Lord, how depressing.  Must have been a terrible time for women!  There is another version that looks a little better.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|An action film of the first order. Totally imaginative, and imagination based. Intermingled genres running the gamut from WWI through Dungeons and Dragons  only add to the entertainment. Short and sweet: The producers let their imaginations run wild, and we reaped the benefits. I've rented this film four times, then bought the Blu-Ray. I am enamoured of action women who are smart, tough and talented with a variety of weapon systems and hand to hand techniques. This film is all that and more.
B00A9T1HUO|1.0|After the first three albums, Josh Groban has steaadily gone downhill. His work is bland, trite, boring, off key and definitely not the Groban that I used to enjoy hearing.<br />Last album for me!
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|What can I say? I Can't wait for the next film to come to us. These films should have been done first, but hey, at least they WERE done. Not to worry, I'll just wait for the next installment of the Hobbit, then watch them all in order.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Another excellent album by one of the world's top vocalists. How could any one go wrong with this purchase, especially given the price!
B004UPALT6|3.0|I'm a fan of Bruce Campbell and the Evil Dead series of films. The playback/download was really poor quality and the film was jumpy and fuzzy. I'll try again later but right now I have to say I was disappointed.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|-product delivered quickly<br />-quality is excellent<br />-my laptop now is cooler and quieter now<br /><br />I have an older laptop HP pavilion DV7 3180us. Which was purchased around 2009 or 2010.  It served me well over the years, but I always have had a major problem: heat.  It always get so hot on top left area that sometimes I feel like I can cook an egg on my laptop.  Worst of all, it get loud and when I do some 3D graphics work, watch videos, or play games.  Finally I have just enough of it.  I am either going to get a new laptop, or try to repair it with a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />After doing some research online, I've realized I must clean the fans, and replace the thermal compound on processor and graphic card. And Artic Silver 5 has one of the best performance, so I went for it.  People use many different methods to apply this.  I think it's best to look at official website and try to match up your processor model and see the recommended way for application.<br /><br />Make sure you becareful during application tho, people on forums say this can damage your pc if you got it on other parts of your components.  I went with size of pea method.  Just because guys on youtube did it this way.  And it seems to work well.<br /><br />If this is your first time as well, you might need<br />-3M SP3010 Nylon Spudger Tool (good for prying out parts without damaging your components)<br />-E-Flite Screwdriver, #00 Phillips (nice screwdriver with magnet)<br />-WEBCOL LARGE (2 PLY) ALCOHOL PREPS, 200/CARTON (cheap wipes to get rid old compound)
B00594XOZU|5.0|It's texting on something that can't text big whoop. I still like it though so buy it for you're I pad or kindle
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This book and this series is just great. I read each book in the series in no time at all because I didn't want to put it down. I was looking for a book like The Host and these were suggested to me.<br /><br />Tally Youngblood is the main character in this series, in book one (Uglies) she is a 15 soon to turn 16 year old girl who wants nothing more than what comes next in her life approximately 300 years in the future. Unfortunately for her, life has different plans. It's a good read, get it and find out for yourself.
B0067R0APK|2.0|App is okay until you try to view radar and then it takes forever if it ever shows anything<br />I liked the old app better it worked
1572814349|5.0|Este é um Tarot maravilhoso.<br />Este Tarot com pinturas da renascência e um dos mais Luxuoso!<br />Comprei e veio rápido.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie. At last, a story a math major could love. But no, this was just terrible. And this comes from someone who has watched Dodgeball. Pi is quirky and takes too long to get to any point. I quit with a headache, much like the one experience by the lead actor.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|The women really shine and spread their wings this season.  Loved Joan, Peggy, Megan, Sally and Betty!  The men continue their downward spiral...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fantastic show.  I came to Downton Abbey late.  Fortunately, my sister loaned me her Season 1 DVD.  Then I discovered every episode of Season 2 available for streaming through my Amazon Prime membership.  First time streaming anything other than a YouTube video -- it was terrific!  With the PopOut setting, I was able to watch in great detail.  Couldn't find the closed-captioning switch at first, but got it on the third episode.  When I'd finished Season 2, I moved on to Season 3 -- recorded on my cable DVR.  Now I'm all caught up ... but I know if I mess an episode, I'll be able to capture it (eventually) on Amazon Instant Video.<br /><br />Thanks for this marvelous feature, AND a terrific series!  Can hardly wait for Season 4 to begin!
B003H4I4JU|2.0|The first book was so full of promise, an extraordinary protagonist, a benign antagonist, all the elements that will confuse and beguile an experianced reader. This book, while well intentioned, and much ballyhooed, is a let down, there is none of the suspense or artistic trickery shown in the original. I was expecting a fast paced read, and did not receive it. The characters lack depth and individuality, not what I had expected after the first brilliant, character driven novel. This book is rooted in moral dillema and felt stretched to do so. The characters were vanilla enough that they almost became confusing, it was hard to seperate what one had done, and who had made the next step. To move from the surprise of genocide to the, slightly smaller and less relevent surprise of this book, was a let down of epic proportions. I will not say that this book is poor, because the writing is magnificent, Card is a wordsmith with few peers, however, the content did indeed let me down.
B009KHCT94|4.0|A fun flick that provided some laughs and an interesting twist with mixing up Star Wars and old WWII good guy versus bad guy stuff.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I love all of Jane Austen's books. This is one of my favorites. I like the way Jane Austen describes her characters and her quick wit and very human observations that are universal even today: love, flirting, gossip, matchmaking, friendship, loyalty. These subjects never lose their appeal and interest no matter what period of time in which they are written.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I was not disappointed in this finale of the series.  The author stayed true to the growth of the characters from the very first book and has established these books as a benchmark for young reading - including their grandparents.  My husband and I began reading the books at the beginning of publication in order to have conversations with our grandchildren and became fans.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I could not put this book down. Anyone who has doubts of heaven will be convinced of an afterlife if they read this man's account. It was a miracle that he even recovered from his coma and was able to write about his near death experience. The fact that he met the sister he never knew in life up in heaven was further convincing.
B0029LCJJS|3.0|Wow, this is almost x rated! It may be historically correct but it is for MATURE audiences and I found it offensive.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app! The graphics are very realistic and the horses are like real. It is by far the best app I have.
B00493E1GI|5.0|A really good movie with some life affirming moments.  Julia Roberts gives the performance you'd expect of her.  I recommend watching this one!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Arrived promptly.  Runs well. Looks good. Good quality construction.  Is accurate so far (I've only had it a short while.)<br /><br />I'm happy to cut my dependency on electricity and batteries.  This watch will keep going no matter what.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We fell in love with the Walking Dead series after the first episode.  Glad to have season 2 behind us as it seems ole' Dale just got to rant for the entire season and drone on to any survivor sorry enough to have to listen to him.<br />Season 3 lands the folks in a run down, grey dreary prison camp.  They are so busy fighting with the governor every time you turn around, they never even got a chance to hang curtains and cheer the place up.  Just when you almost forget you're watching a zombie movie, the producers throw in an always awesome zombie scene to cheer you up and take out who ever may be annoying you!
B00BWJ91XK|5.0|What I really want is the Extended Edition, but that won't be ready until later this year.  For now there's only the theatrical edition available on Blu-Ray.  So I had a dilemma...I didn't want to buy the Blu-Ray twice...but I want to see the movie again now.  :-)  Compromise:  buy the video-on-demand version, since that's cheaper than the theatrical Blu-Ray.<br /><br />So, so far my kids and I have gotten part of the way through, on two separate nights.  The one thing I miss is subtitles, which would help the kids understand the characters with stronger accents (and tickle my geekish fancy by showing dialogue in other languages).  That, I guess, will wait for the Extended Edition.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Thrilling from the first page until the last! Nicholas Sparks has a way of making his characters come to life.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|Good storyline and quality, but doesn't always work. I had to delete it after I bought the feel full version and start over because it didn't work. The same thing has happened to me twice now. But if you get past the loading problems, it is a really good game.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Too bad the the republican party today reminds me of the Democratic party of Lincolns day. It appears we even needed Gun<br />control legislation even back than.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie because it made me feel good. If things go bad in your life don't let it get to you and give up. Find a way to turn things around, but do not compromise who you are, If you believe in yourself others will see that and begin to believe in you. Things are not always what they seem to be.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Was not my type of movie. Too slow moving. Same old politics. Acting was good. Not enough personal information on the characters
B0055SWM08|5.0|Beware! It's a fun mental challenge and rather addictive.  Having repeatedly played Angry Birds and Plants vs Zombies, I'm glad to have found a new favorite game.
B008Y79IUE|4.0|Worth watching for Jennifer Connelly. If you could jump to the parts with her in it, and kind of block the part of the screen where whoever else is in the scene, then it is enjoyable enough to watch but I don't recommend doing something like just sitting there watching the entire movie. That would be dumb.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really liked this book. I like Mr. Landay's writing style and found it very hard to put down. If you enjoy detective/courtroom drama with some family dynamics thrown in you will enjoy reading this book. I have purchased both of his other published books and look forward to reading them also.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I wanted something to write notes down and this works great. It is very user friendly and simple to use.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|Speedy delivery and well packaged.  Love the full screen edition because it takes up the entire screen on our wide screen television.  With the wide screen versions we always have empty space on top and at the bottom of the screen.  Will buy from this seller again!
B004UJAOLM|3.0|It's been a long time since the first time I read this enjoyed it more as an adult<br />Wuthering heights
B003VXMMTK|5.0|The drama is set in a different era but to me, it applies to all eras. Have your box of tissues handy!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I really loved this book because it took you to a place where you don't know is really there, unless you have been in a similar situation. Not only was it very dark and scary, there were times where it became happy and hopeful. Definitely a page turner!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Good story line.  Great casting.  The characters are not shallow but multidimensional.  Seems historically accurate and gives a glimpse into a bygone era.
B00BF11STU|1.0|All talk and no action, and there's no action in the talk.  So much unnecessary babble along with poor acting.  Certainly not worthy of any kind of award nomination.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I bought this for my kid & she enjoyed reading it a lot. She has all the books in the set & has read it all of them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter and now both my husband and myself fight for it.  It is a wonderful game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I bought this for my kid & she enjoyed reading it a lot. She has all the books in the set & has read it all of them.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|this is a great item for the money, easy to use, very simple, much less then what you would pay another retailer, if you need an external battery charger, dont waste your time looking any further. you will love this, one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My granddaughter absolutely loves this game!  Great for hand - eye coordination.  She would spend all day playing it if we let her.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I've loved this show since the pilot, and this season is no exception. You can feel how close we are to finally knowing who the mother is, and there are tons of funny nods to early seasons that really make it all the more rewarding. I never thought I'd see &#34;Coat Check Girl&#34; again!<br /><br />So excited there will be a Season 9.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I purchased this for my six-year-old granddaughter to play when she visits.  She loves the Littlest Pet Shop toys and this is another fun way for her to enjoy her favorites.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Just not what I thought it would be.  Ending was very disappointing. Felt very sorry for the child at the end of the story
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My granddaughter has this game on her Ipad at home and loves to play  it.  Now she can play it on grandma's Kindle!  Good game for eye-hand coordination
0321647440|5.0|I'm not a technical person by no means and I consider myself a serious hobbyist, not a professional. Was recommended either Aperture or Lightroom, decided to go with Aperture for the &#34;simpleton&#34; features. I purchased this book as a guide and it worked great. The book provides you a cd of images to work on while going through the step by step of all the features of Aperture. My photos have improved greatly because of the knowledge this book provided.
1451695195|1.0|Hated this piece of junk that made absolutely no sense.  Thought it would make my grief easier to handle - quite the opposite
B00BESNKB8|3.0|Cool movie but would have been better w/o rza. His acting is horrible and kung fu skills are sub-par at best. The plot and costumes were pretty cool.
B0054SMID0|5.0|This was a great show for people who want to be a cop or a lawyer. It was a great Tv show I would give it 5 stars
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Not a big zombie fan, but this show is great.  Character development is excellent and the lack of CGI is impressive
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Great movie with a different perspective of Lincoln.  It was interesting to view his politics and his &#34;lawyer&#34; side. Would recommend to any Lincoln fan.
B008HFWF3U|4.0|PM releases are ALWAYS good...  Not THE one to buy if you are not already a fan, but if you are a fan, a must additional chapter in the ongoing book of PM music.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|The kids enjoyed it and it was watchable from adult standpoint. And it brought back reminiscence of the all good old arcade days
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|It was fun. I liked the fact that I could play it for a couple minutes after a time.<br />It is also the type of game that you can leave it alone for a couple weeks and pick upright where you left off.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Love it was good it could've probably been a little bit shorter and maybe two movies not three but first I was good so far
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The first in the series was excellent. As it went along it became a little like a sci-fi soap opera.
B005XR3K5M|5.0|My daughter just loves Legend of Zelda stuff and she loves playing cards...so this was the best of both worlds for her!!  They are beautiful!!!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|As usual, Supernatural has not failed to keep me interested.  I love every twist and turn these two brothers encounter in this series.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Do it, do it now.  You won't regret it.  This show is bloody fantastic.  But watch the first four seasons first.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|good show hope there is going to be more,  its  a good fix for my game of thrones addiction so
0399160450|1.0|This book was very interesting for about 100 pages than became the most disgusting type of book I can ever read!  The sexual intimidation of Michelle by this s*** head is NOT the kind of kicks anyone should enjoy!!!  I walked from the living room directly to the trash can in the kitchen and dumped this piece of garbage right were it belonged!  Ban this kind of thrash by not buying it!!!!!!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|My nine year old grandson was telling me what to do, but I still couldn't get the hang of it.  I don't play it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a great game if you have spare time. its fun to play and its not the same repetitive thing over and over again.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have a lot of fun trying to win and making rows of kings.  You have to get all the kings free before you can build a column.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|While watching this I was so excited about how much fun it was to watch that I couldn't wait to watch it again.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I recommend this to anyone who likes a good puzzle.  It doesn't take forever for you to finish, but gives you a good game.
0307266303|5.0|I love this book so much that not only did I read it twice but, I lost it and want to buy it again.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This was a great DVD and the series is excellent.  I highly recommend this purchase for anyone who loves the series.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|This is the first time I have played this type of puzzle and I am completely hooked. It is so simple to play but really makes you think. It would be even better if you had another marking option for those squares you think might be part of the puzzle but that's a minor gripe, I still love it.
0812550706|1.0|Cannot even begin to read this book because the print is micro-small.<br /><br />Don't ever buy any &#34;commercial editions&#34;of any paperback; it's a waste of money.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love reading books written by Nicolas Sparks. I know it's usually the same story line, but it's always a good read that leaves you feeling happy at the end.
B00138KJY0|5.0|How do you really rate Michael Jackson..I mean come on, the man is a classic and this was produced by THE Quincy Jones....WIN WIN situation!
B004G600A4|5.0|I babysit my grandchildren and they enjoy watching Tangled.  Even my husband enjoyed it.  The old story of Rapunzel has been redone in a great style.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I rented this when 3 of my grandkids visited. I have to be honest and say I didn't watch it, I visited my daughter. The grandkids stayed glued to the t.v. and really enjoyed it.
B008EKMB82|5.0|A carefully crafted and charming &#34;gentle suspense&#34; time warp in which essential Zen is illuminated by the thoughts and actions of the characters.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love playing this in my free time when I have nothing to do,and it never gets boring. It is totally worth downloading.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I happen to see on one of my blogs that this was on super special for kindle, and I have only read the first book, so of course I jumped at the chance to get the trilogy at an awesome price!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I had a different ap on my older phone this is so much better! I works really well and the light is very bright. Nice for trying to open a door at night and you need that extra light.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the writing and cast! Will definitely watch the upcoming Season 4. The scenery is amazing and it is a great way to see what it was like to live for both the English wealthy and those who served them.
0894803123|4.0|Really like it, contains many ice cream and sorbet recipes in it.  My husband has really enjoyed using this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Didn't put it down. Continued to read it because it was intriguing and a real page turner.<br />Read this book non-stop...you'll be glad you did.
B0093LINVK|5.0|I am very impressed with this little computer!  It is mighty on speed and power and still fits in the palm of my hand!  I use it as my entertainment center and it kicks @ss!  HDMI throughput is flawless, boot time is 8 seconds, even games without huge hardware needs run smoothly on it!  It does get warm when you run it, but it only gets so warm and no warmer, which is pretty good for a tiny computer.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this item!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|All the evils of slavery and indenture in one true-sounding story while also giving us hope for the human spirit by the way those &#34;owned&#34; people managed to find some joy, show goodness and true wisdom even while surviving terrible ordeals. At times I got really angry at the main protagonist because she never could be open and honest at the right time. Perhaps that was the culture of the time, hiding truth.
B007EECSFA|3.0|It wasn't a book I just couldn't put down but it is one I enjoyed coming back to time and again when  I had time to read.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I bought the audible version of this book as soon as it came out.  I was stoked to see the ending of this trilogy.  While I didn't love it, I did enjoy it.<br /><br />I didn't really care for Hana's point of view.  It made me drowsy most of the time.  But it was important in the way events took place.  Both Hana & Lena's futures do intertwine.  I remember loving Hana in Delirium, but I couldn't stand her character in this book.  She tries to help some people, but it's only to lessen the guilt she feels.<br /><br />Lena is fierce as always.  She's crazy confused about her boy troubles, but she tries to stay level-headed.  She feels so many different emotions in this book: love, loss, betrayal, and heartbreak.  Each emotion she feels strongly.  There's no slight feelings, each is felt with passion.  She makes some rash decisions, but I've never respected her more than I do in this book.<br /><br />There are so many things that happen, and each event sets the bigger picture into motion.  Hana's engagement, and Lena's relationship with her mother are two big things that take up most of the story.  The Alex, Lena, Julian thing is also a major factor.  I can't help but love Julian.  He CHOSE to leave the city and go to the Wilds with Lena.  That right there shows how much he cares.  He knows there's a story between Alex and Lena, but doesn't question it.  He tries to be there for Lena as much as he can.  Alex on the other hand comes off as a jerk.  I will never understand the stubbornness of men! It's never ending.<br /><br />I think I didn't love it because I didn't get a sense of closure at the end.  There's so many ways the story could still go on, but we don't know which way it will go.  I also didn't really agree with how Lena left things in the end.  When you read, you'll understand, maybe.  Other than that, the book was great. I loved the action, and confrontations in it.  They made the events seem real, and easy to imagine.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is a beautifully written, heartfelt story about faith. It explores our relation to God and our souls. I was so moved by it that I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks afterwards.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Really good Prequal!<br /><br />It was done very well, and everything came together, I will be adding this to my collection!
B0053O8ARI|5.0|Prior to buying 2 Broke Girls on bluray, I had only ever seen commercials, and had never seen a single episode; however, I've enjoyed Kat Dennings in other roles, which was enough for me to make this purchase, and give it a chance. I was not disappointed; the show is hilarious, and i enjoy all of the characters. The humor is fairly raunchy, so I wouldn't recommend it for younger viewers, but if you enjoy raunchy humor, and sexual innuendo, then this show should be right up your alley.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|this was a really great movie, I felt they could have done more with it but it was really entertaining.
B009R6OTI2|5.0|The training material in the book and accompanying files is quite good at getting<br />you up to speed on using the software to its fullest potential. It's structured in a<br />logical manner in that it gives you a brief overview of the software's capabilities,<br />then it starts in on the basics that you need to know to manage your photos with<br />the software. Only after teaching you the basics of photo management, does it<br />go on to more advanced editing topics.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The entire series is riveting and hard to put down, despite the 1000 or so pages of each book. Keeping track of the hundreds of characters and locations is a challenge, however, helped by the appendix and an app. I downloaded for free. It's all so worth it.<br />There were times in this book that I thought Martin took too many diversions or moved too slowly. After all the dragons don't really appear until about 3/4 of the way through the book. And then it stops with so many loose ends. I'm already in withdrawal awaiting the 6th volume that has been delayed until the fall.<br />I vote this series as among the finest pieces of literature ever produced.
B0039N74CW|5.0|I now have all 4 of the Shrek movies. They are a joy for me and my children alike. Thank you
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a book about the triumph of the human spirit in very trying circumstances.  It is hard to imagine, but a good story.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|I love this entire book series & this movie. Although the movie did not stick to the story line of the books it was an enjoyable film
193609648X|5.0|This is a very nice book that arrived promptly, and was in perfect condition.I plan to make at least one of the designs!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved every minute if it!!! Great love story, it had me smiling at my kindle like an idiot lol!! Awesome
B00BF123WG|5.0|Great movie, would highly recommend watching it! I was glad to find it on Amazon and as always it was a quick secure purchase with an excellent picture quality.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I can't begin to describe how amazing I found this book to be. I would recommend this book to every single person I know.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|This movie was full of exaggerated punch lines. If you're looking for complex plot development and character development, choose something else.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a game that you could play for hours and it takes a lot of practice but I recommend that you try this game. It is the definition of so much fun so try it.
B005LAII3U|5.0|I found the movie interesting. A lot darker than the original, and more continuous action. But it was great they put in references to the original. The women were hot.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing.<br />I loved it so much. A must-read. Love story entwined with life and situations. Will be rereading this book.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading all of the D.D.Warren books.  I would recommend Lisa Gardner to anyone who enjoys suspense.
B00421IR5I|5.0|This movie starts out a little slow but picks up pace quickly.  The children are endearing as well as great actors.  The adults are good, but the children make the show.  Some parts of this movie are just too good for words.  Everyone in our family loved it.  We enjoy watching movies with subtitles.  The French actors have such great facial expressions.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Recommended to my by my sister.  I really enjoyed reading the book and would recommend it to anyone who likes to read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is by far the best show on television. The characters and story line are addictive. Everyone should watch this show.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|You can't go wrong when reading Nicholas Sparks.  All of his book have a great story and are very easy to read.
B00AX7PGQS|3.0|\\"Holy Motors,\\" Leos Carax's latest film, is fascinating and baffling at the same time. Filled with cinematic references, the film is puzzling, funny, strange and often dark. It's a Carax film made for Carax. We just follow his journey.<br /><br />The film centers on a mysterious man played by Denis Lavant, who moves around in Paris in a white limousine. The driver Céline (Édith Scob) calls him M. Oscar, but nothing is certain, except that \\"Oscar,\\" who always looks tired, wears make-ups in the car and plays eleven roles after reading the dossiers given to him. In short, he lives eleven different \\"lives\\" over a course of a day.<br /><br />\\"Holy Motors\\" is full of cinematic allusions including some major works like \\"The Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"Godzilla\\" (what a combination!) as well as \\"Max My Love\\" and Carax's own \\"The Lovers on the Bridge.\\" Kylie Minogue's character would remind us of Juliette Binoche's heroine on the Pont Neuf.<br /><br />The film can be interpreted in many ways. But we should also keep in mind that Leos Carax's last feature film \\"Pola X\\" (made in 1999) was based on Herman Melville's unconventional novel \\"Pierre: or, The Ambiguities.\\"<br /><br />I know it's a matter of taste, but for all the film's touching moments, I didn't like \\"Holy Motors\\" very much, not because of its ambiguous nature, but because of its pervading pessimistic tone. Considering the death of Carax's Yekaterina Golubeva (her brief footage inserted at the end of the film), this is only natural.<br /><br />After all this is Leos Carax's film, for better or for worse.
B000FC146C|5.0|Watched the mini series so I wanted to read the book.  Really enjoyed it and would recommend anyone read it.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Rebus is back!  Still difficult, still frustrating, still leading an unhealthy lifestyle, still has trouble with following rules, but more effective than anyone else around.  Great story, great characters, captures Scotland beautifully.  It is like having an old, brilliant, but difficult good friend back in your life!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|All of Nicholas Sparks' book are so good.  I read every book he writes sometines twice.  Such good stories that keep you interested.
B00ADQCBEY|2.0|This was just too rough for us - from story line to language to intensity.  Just was not our thing.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This series is worth reading.  It was very suspenseful and kept me wanting to read more. I would recommend tit
B004OZZ624|3.0|This movie was action packed in typical George Clooney style. It also had a Lot of heart. You can't help but route for him
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The three books of this series was so good.  It story kept me wanting to read more.  Would recommend it.
B000ICXQGK|5.0|excellent film with tremendous visuals, and excellent performances<br />from the lead performers.  Touching theme about LOVE<br />which will stir the emotions of those who watch.  The cinema<br />work is magnificent.  It is like watching a series of classic<br />paintings which come to life.
B002E19M02|3.0|This book didn't hold my attention and had to force myself to finish reading it.  This is not the sort of book I enjoy reading.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|There are two series story arcs in this show, the murder of Beckett's mother and the mutual attraction of Castle and Beckett that both keep denying. Both came to a major conclusion in season 4. Several episodes in season 5 explore the consequences of the resolutions. The love story consequences are humorous. The murder story has a surprising twist.<br /><br />In addition there are several outstanding episodes. Many series have done a murdered Santa Claus episode (Secret Santa) but they usually portrait the man playing Santa Claus as less than saintly. In the Castle episode, the man was trying to do good and murdered for that reason. Another good episode was the Valentine episode (Reality Star Struck). It has the usual mixture of comedy and serious drama but it was the ending that was so perfect for a Valentine episode and it was quite unexpected. This season has my favorite episode (The Final Frontier) which was a well done Star Trek take off.<br /><br />Anyone who is not a regular viewer of the series can check out the above 3 standalone episodes to get a taste of what makes the series so good.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This series was good.  A little weird at times but the story kept me wanting to read more.  Liked it.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I started watching because of Brendan Coyle but now I have a whole new cast of favorites to watch for.
B00000IBVC|1.0|warning upon inserting disc: \\"region error\\",\\"please eject the disc\\" & \\"playback is not authorized in your region\\" even time- warner never heard of this.accidents do happen! WHEN DO I GET MY MONEY BACK?
B00BWJARHO|4.0|The Hobbit was about as good as I had heard from friends: not the shinning light of accomplishment the LotR turned out to be, a little slow moving at times (not surprising given that one book was stretched into three long-ish movies, as opposed to the triology before that was three movies condensed from three long-ish novels), but still watchable and fun to see Peter Jackson bring his craft to bear in a familiar setting. Why am I praying that the Hobbits swirls into a huge battle in the third installment, a la Return of the King?
B00BQUUH7E|4.0|This is new way for fun. But it not easy when playing on touch screen, I feel playing on device support d-pad will well
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am a 60 year old grandmother and loved this book about teen love.  I've already signed up for the sequel.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|My mistake when I bought this game. Because when my network lag and I tap quickly, i don't like this game but also refund money.
0307346617|5.0|if you like the whole zombie thing, this book is pretty good. it's told in a sort of episodic format, as others have mentioned, which was great for me. i don't always have a ton of time to read, and this made it nice and easy to read when i had the time. that said, the book was great so i found myself making time to read it!<br /><br />i did suggest it to a few buddies as a good book to place by the throne, because it can be read in short increments.
B00B23O97Y|5.0|super super album, I really liked all the songs on the album, and the digital download was a simple process. If you like hearing great music played by some of the best then this is the album to get for the collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game. I enjoy it myself very much. It's good for times when I'm bores but I enjoy Subway Surfers. So y'all did a great job and love the updates.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|My wife and I really enjoy anything that Denzel Washington is in, but we were not expecting this type of movie. Great in depth look in to a &#34;character role&#34; for Denzel Don't expect an aviation movie as we did, or you might be disapointed.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Perfect for what I need it for to charge my iPhone and iPad. Also love the size, fits perfectly in my purse or back pocket.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Just think of sitting down and watching it time and time again. You will always see things each time around that you did not see the first time around. Great specail effects. Can't wait to see the 2nd of the triolgy.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Lot of going to different timelines but still very interesting.  A lot about shoe technology and the authors opinions and back up info.  i started to incorporate some of that thinking into how I tie my shoes before walking.
B006C45MRE|2.0|With a different script and cast this story may have had some potential, but this movie is a dud. I really like the science fiction genre, but watching this movie left me feeling somewhere between the first Star Trek movie and the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Super cool and fun. Kept me occupied for HOURS! There are tons of characters to buy, different specials and power ups all the time. I recommend this if you are bored.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Actually put together better than I had feared.  With all of the publicity and hype it is hard to know whether a movie is well made or not.  This is a keeper.  The bringing together of all of the Heroes was well done.
B007SGM084|5.0|Couldn't put this down. Smashed all three books in less than a week ans a half. I pray the movie will do the book justice. Cant wait.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|Love jazz radio I can listen to whatever type of jazz I am feeling on any given day. There is a type of jazz for everyone.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book is definitely one of my favorites. There is always something going on and it hooks you right from the start.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The was slow in places but I wanted to stay with it til the end. The ending was kind of a let down, but still not a bad book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This a suspenseful, fun book.  The characters are full of courage. The ending was very surprising but in the coolest way possible. I highly recommended!
B00AQ2KLEM|5.0|I loved the movie with all this awesome music.My daughter and I totally enjoyed the movie and the cd is always in the car. We love it.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|Wicked awesome movie. I did an internship with the Forest Service for 5 months and lived in the woods during that time. I had read the book and I wasn't quite living off the land like Chris. Great soundtrack and well done film. Highly recommended.
B00005ATZT|5.0|Excellent movie.This movie will keep you on your feet.Harrison is awesome in this movie. Totally action packed.What more can I say.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I have played solitare until my eyes crossed.... so i  needed something a little different that i could pick up and play. This has been a nice game to fill time.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Just tried this cuz ebay wouldn't work on my kindle. Haven't been using it very long but seems good so far.
B004DHUAZQ|2.0|Lot's of fighting gore and explosions. That's about it. Dark scenes were hard to see and audio not good.  The plot was week.  I would not recommend it.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Hooked this gem into a rode mic and it worked like a charm, can also stand alone as a recorder
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Just heard Leonard Cohen for the first time a few weeks ago and ordered his music.  It is great and I have enjoyed listening to him.  Not sure how I missed him in all the past years, but nice to find him now.
B002UZXJA6|4.0|I love all the Celtic Women cd's, worth the money and each cd has a great selection. I would recommend this.
B00999DFP0|3.0|They shipped fast. They had several DVD's that would not play or some just parts of them. I love the show so was sad to see the shape they came in.
B00B23O96A|2.0|I was very disappointed with this effort. Most tracks appear to be rejects from previous projects.  Many of them seem self-indulgent and ill-thought thru.  Maybe he's getting too old to generate quality new material.  The fans deserve better than this.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|I will watch this many more times just because I like the Marvel story but I wish that the storyline would be a little bit better.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Love her twisted tales!! Especially loved the characters in this book. Was blown away at the end. Definitely one I had trouble putting down!
B0080M3OGW|3.0|Not a great movie, but it was entertaining.  DeNiro and Streep give decent performances, but why is Harvey Keitel only lifting one weight on the Nautilus machine (be on the lookout for this short scene, you'll smile when you catch it)
B000CEAGH6|5.0|Grandson loves them so  I keep buying him more.The next time will be for his birthday and I will get a bigger one for hime to play with.
B004OZZ624|5.0|Very good movie. You can really get into it. I was going to give it 4.5 but could;t so I rounded up. The ending is not the greatest but it lets you use your imagination a bit.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have enjoyed all harry bosch novels I look forward to others as they become available.I would also like another novel with Harry and his half brother - the Lincoln lawyer.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I held off for a long time, but finally caved and started watching the first season, which enthralled and captivated me with the world that is created in the show! Downton explores the complexity and richness of human relationships with so much more taste and beauty than just about anything else on TV in the last two decades. Season 2 adds much more depth to this world in new and unexpected ways.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I enjoyed the trilogy but honestly feel the entire story could have fit into one book. I sure hope they don't try to make three movies.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Good show.  A little bit of sci-fi but they make it seem possible.  Or maybe I need to go back to school
B007LE2VDM|5.0|not much to say other than this is what I wanted.  download went smoothly. I don't have 6 more words!
B00B2166BS|5.0|I've only used the charger for charging, and not for data transfer yet, but it does a great job charging.  I generally let my device get close to drained before recharging, and the pogo charger has greatly reduced the recharge time.  Not sure why Google didn't ship one of these with the device.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Made me laugh outloud.  Enjoyed reading a book from the perspective of a woman my age.  She's a witty one.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game is so addicting!  I love it and cant put it down! Sadly I'm almost at level 100 already. I wish it was longer. Well worth the download! !!
B001NLKWLW|4.0|I read the SECRET KEEPER first. That was a mistake. I should have read this book first and I would have seen the growth of this young writer.
B004SH40BQ|1.0|Kokkia i10s failed to pair with Logitech Boombox UE speaker as advertised.  After repeated attempts the Kokkia i10s failed to pair with the Logitech Boombox UE, when connected to an Ipod Classic. An email received in response to my request for technical assistance from customer support failed to provide resolution.  The tech support response provided little more than information contained on their website.  I decided to return the item and request a refund.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book was so realistic I could not put it down. The characters were life-like and could have been my neighbors.
0061478784|5.0|I love it when a children's book doesn't feel like it's written for kids. Perfect for fans of the Studio Ghibli movie or just fantasy lovers.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|WOW...I am amazed at how good RUSH is and this DVD is great....The BEST part is with Alex and the group dressed up at the diner..SAUSAGE TIME! They are not only talented musicians but very FUNNY too. The quality and sound is just perfect and of course...I doubt that you will beat the AMAZON PRICE...I always make sure I have a few small items to bring my total up to $25 for the FREE SHIPPING (on MOST items) and if they ever do away with the FREE SHIPPING ,I would shop elsewhere but for now...Amazon has my business  on almost everything I buy in my day to day life...They are soooo low on prices,I even have boycott Auto Zone and Advanced Auto Parts unless it is something I need TODAY...Can NOT beat the Amazon price....sorry Brick and mortor stores that are local....quit gouging and lower your prices like Amazon if you want business.Great Job AMAZON. Keep Rocking RUSH.
0679745653|5.0|For fans of the movie, reading this book is a must. The extra stories in this collection are a bonus!
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|My daughter and I loved this movie. It's a great story and I'm an old gamer so all of the little touches really made it great. Especially the Metal Gear Solid one, as small as it was but it was still cool. Like most of the kids movies coming out today, adults will enjoy this as well. Fix it Felix Whoo Whoo!!!
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book gave me a new perspective on the &#34;wheat / gluten&#34; craze I have been hearing/reading so much about these days.  I am giving it a 30 day go - will see what happens.
B0000028P8|5.0|when is mariah never not amazing live?<br /><br />everyone knows that i'll be there was a #1 smash . . . but doing emotions live . . . epic . . . and my favorite song by far on the album is if it's over . . . you have restraint, power, emotion, lyrics . . . mmm . . . nobody else can do that live or even in the studio<br /><br />i just wish there were more songs . . .
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was a fun little movie that didn't take itself seriously.  The music is great, fat Amy is the highlight of the movie for me.  Her improv is hysterical.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I could not put it down anymore once I had started reading.<br />The subject matter is quite interesting and the complicated plot quite good.
B007FROH4G|5.0|I don't know why I bought this book it is not the sort of book I usually read. Needless to say I am so glad I bought it. It has shown me a world that many people experience.  Lisa Genova has written this book from a unique perspective that of person with Alzheimer. In the story we follow the life of his still young woman and read about her minds deterioration.  This is an unusual treatment of this issue because most often we find out about this illness from family and carers so to be able to read it from Alice's point of view makes the story more meaningful and poignant.
B000QY9WOU|4.0|If you really love this show, better get the dvd or bluray. Streaming drops the quality, both picture and sound, to a huge extent. This is one of the best concert I have seen with friends, and it is worth buying the your own non-streamed copy.
B003V1WTMM|2.0|I kept trying to get into the story and kept hoping that something exciting was going to happen... it never did. The book presents itself like a mystery or some kind of unraveling tale of magic but in the end the \\"surprise\\" is really boring and I'm sad i wasted hours of my life getting to the end. Its nicely written but its SO boring.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It does what it's supposed to, is simple and works. What else could you want? If you are struggling to wake up make the math harder or add problems. No other alarm needed.
B001POX73C|5.0|I love everything she writes. It's a guilty pleasure to get involved in Heyer's world of characters. If you love Regency, she is the author for you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It takes the stress away from a hard day's work. My family loves this app.  Can't remember what I did before this came along
B00BI73CVI|5.0|The movie adaption of the musical was truly amazing! I was blown away by the performances and Anne Hathaway's \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" was breathtaking!!!
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|An incredible movie to watch, kept me on the edge of my seat.  The best one yet.  I hope that they will change their minds.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Anecdotal book, with many examples of her personal experiences. the reader gets, if not an understanding, then at least a glimpse of a [female] leader mentality.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|The headline say's it all, a complete waste of my time.  I would much rather sit through one of those 4 hr Lifetime Movie Network flicks than to have watched this one.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really loved the characters in this book. All-around an easy book to read. Made me laugh, cry, and think.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Other than Sean Connery Daniel Craig by far has to be the best Bond since the man himself and I really enjoyed how they tied everything together and brought back the classic Ashtin Martin and the original MI6 office and how Money Penny and Bond first met.  These are how Bond movies should be made, and I can't wait to see another.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great for developing strategies to beat your own best scores. You can determine level of difficulty for even more challenges
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best keyboard app I have found.  Increased my speed and accuracy immeasurably.  Highly recommended for anyone withy a smartphone or tablet (I bought it for both).
1611134226|5.0|Masterful as in every other book of the series, the author has shaped the main character into a mysterious and charismatic presence the permeates every line. The reader is perfect, Pendergast comes alive in every word. Awesome!
B00A85EMVK|4.0|This movie is marginal at best.  No, really....it's sappy, it's got a dumb love story, and it's not exactly realistic.  All that said, the flying is pretty awesome, and it's easy to see why the Navy LOVED this movie as a recruitment tool.  But, time marched on....and while everybody remembers Top Gun, no one actually had watched it forever.<br /><br />So as a 3D freak, I've seen some GREAT 3D, and I've seen truly godawful 3D (Alice in Wonderland, anyone?).  So it was with some trepidation that I placed the order for this remastered version.  And I gotta tell you, glad I did.  While I wouldn't call this a truly GREAT 3D conversion, it's pretty damn good.  The flying sequences ARE truly great...it's the crowd shots and the dialog scenes that are left wanting.<br /><br />But, the price is right...if you want a 3D version of Top Gun, absolutely you won't be disappointed.  By the 3D, that is.  The movie?  That's another story.  :-)
B009LMTDL0|4.0|some very relevant issues are discussed. the book not only has something for working women but also for working men. The most striking issue discussed in the book is the myth of 'having it all'.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|There are many articulate reviews here so I will just give you a raw emotional take. MAN! GET THIS FRICKING ANTHOLOGY! DO IT RIGHT NOW!<br /><br />If you like The Allman Brothers, The Grateful Dead, Eric Clapton, as well as history's greatest blues players, you will be overjoyed by this music as I am. There are many cuts here that I guarantee you have never heard before and you will find yourself smiling and nodding your head over and over as you mentally add new all-time-classics into your inner jukebox.<br /><br />I never realized just how versatile and how great a musician Duane Allman really was. The biggest surprise for me were the three cuts with Herbie Mann on flute. Duane had jazz chops like you never knew. Open wide and take in the best 7 CDs of the year.<br /><br />Absolutely essential collection for all blues lovers.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I have been a Paramore fan for years and this is in my opinion their best album to date. Yes, it has a different sound, but I think that is a good thing. This is an eclectic album. There is some Pop, Gospel and of course Rock sounds in this album. My favorite tracks are Fast in My Car, Now, Daydreaming, Grow Up, Still Into You and Ain't it fun. I love every song on the album but, those are my favorites. There is not one song I want to skip while I listen to it. (The interludes are also great.)
B0013UIUBC|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  It kept my interest on a long cross country flight, Catherine Zeta-Jones was great for the part.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I got this mouse to replace my Razer Imperator which started to act up.<br /><br />I wasn't quite sure about going with Anker, as I was unfamiliar with them and the price put them in the budget range.<br /><br />I decided to take a chance, at worst for that price I could put it on another computer if it didn't work out for gaming.<br /><br />It took me a few days to get use to and a bit of tweaking with the sensitivity and acceleration, but I can easy say I'm glad I bought this mouse.<br /><br />The mouse feels great ergonomically. the buttons are easy to reach and use. The three buttons on the top in addition to the scroll wheel is great. A visual indicator on the left side of the mouse shows what sensitivity level you're at.<br /><br />The Anker mouse by default will map the three side buttons to Ctrl, Alt, and Shift. As far as I can tell, they can't be mapped to the traditional \\"Mouse 4\\", \\"Mouse 5\\", etc. This doesn't bother me too much. I set the buttons to keyboard keys that make sense to me, but it's something to consider if you have all your games mapped to these mouse buttons.<br /><br />There is an easy on-the-fly macro recorder and playback tool assigned to two of the top buttons by default. It works well, but I haven't used it much. Instead I remapped the buttons.<br /><br />Build quality feels good. The weights can be added to add a bit extra heft to it so you can find the balance you prefer.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend this mouse. It deserves to be compared to mice that selling for twice as much.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I had wanted to see this for a while but didn't want to purchase it.  Thanks to Amazon I was able to rent and download to my Kindle to enjoy on a cross country flight.  Thanks!
1451695195|5.0|Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. I hope that agnostics will read it and come to understand the spiritual side of our lives.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This was so fun and intelligent and heart warming.  I would recommend it to anyone.  All the characters were very real.  You felt as is you got to know them all.
B003FHMHPQ|1.0|Totally unbelievable!  I've read many new age books and have gotten something out of many of them.  This one seemed too much wishful thinking.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy this almost as much as my granddaughter.  It is very good for special awareness and fun to challenge oneself for speed
B00BF11STU|2.0|This movie drags.  It's a docu drama.  If you want a 'movie', Seal Team Six is better.  Not sure which story is more accurate, as we will never know.  The storming the compound scenes drag on forever and are not nearly as realistic as Seal Team Six.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|We love to play to see who can get the highest score...seems she wins most of the time.  It's a lot of fun!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This is quite an interesting show, much better than some of the offerings on today's commercial networks.  Plus we can watch this without any intervening commercials, what a blessing.
B00BF11STU|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie more, but it was just ok.  Dialog at times was hard to hear/understand.
B006LSZECO|5.0|\\"  Wow!!!!  I hardly EVER write a review but this book was the most fantasic book I ever read; oops....actually - \\"listned to\\"!!!! This Audible book was so freaking good I can't even think of what to say because if I say anything you may have a clue to the \\"Holy SH__ - OMG\\" parts!!!  I never read this author before nor listen to the narrators but I am about to do a search on anything they've ever written/read!  I'm normally a \\"historical romance\\" kind of listener but somehow I found this book and can't believe how much I was sucked-in and addicted to hearing it.  If it were $100 it would be worth it :)<br /><br />  Dear Author, PLEASE contine with your writing and TELL ME when any book is available!!!!  I will be seaching for them all!!!! (oh - and it's YOU'RE fault I have been sleepy at work because I stayed awake as long as I could to listen to this book!!!)
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like that my phone and tablet display the temperature so I know how to dress. It's so easy to check daily, weekly, etc weather for my area as well as family or for when I plan to travel.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This was very imaginative!  It was a new idea on timeless children stories. The visual we beautiful and the humor was just enough.
B0063GORYU|3.0|It's okay when I want to relax. Doesn't much effort to play the game. Better than solitaire. That is all.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|Interesting, but not my kind of movie. It was a family movie that I managed to stay to the end.
B000L53D4O|4.0|The baby thinks this toy is great and won't let anyone else go near it! Hasn't played with another toy since receiving this one
B00B10ENBA|4.0|Brings a lot of information to light. What a great dedicated and motivated American. Would watch it again at some time.
6300208699|2.0|Too much nihilistic 60s-70s fluff. The movie could have been somewhat redeemed if the slave ship scene with Raquel Welch had been greatly expanded.
1439102813|4.0|I know it will give me real insight into memory loss.  A friend who has had a husband with Alzheimer's disease told me to get this book.
B00942S4OY|5.0|I was really happy when it came almost a month early! I really love it! Best CD ever, and definitely not a waste of money!
B009K0P10K|5.0|Super cheesy but such great clothing & the homes are to die for, fun eye candy. My guilty pleasure for sure :)
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|It came almost a month early! I dont really know what to say but I love One Direction and I was really happy when It got here so early!!!!! Definately not a waste of money!!!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I liked this story and the writing improved as the story unfolded. I could see some crazy scheme like this being put into place. And of course the \\"everyone is equal\\" will never work, people aren't made like that. What happened to the other silos? Why were all the people going outside? Why did we poison the air? Yes, I would like to read more.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|nice and time consuming!!! fun and always makes it easy to play and its such a great game that actually doesn't have violence
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob explores juvenile murder from the perspective of the defendant's family in a captivating manner. It is a story that lingers in the mind of the reader days after completing the novel.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Not for my 3 year who spooks easy but I really enjoyed it. I would watch it again with out without kids :)
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a fun little game that is fast paced and keeps you busy.  It's a good way to pass the time while waiting for whatever.  Not a lot of thinking involved, but sometimes that's what I want.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Wanted to watch something a little different had some good lines in it, was a fun and cute story to watch.
B000JMKNV0|2.0|It was too convoluting for my taste.  I'm nearly 78 years old and I don't need the stress it deals with.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The story line is great. I have been watching for the begining. Each season gets better and better.  The action is great. Can't wait for season 4
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I like the bible app but i put it on my kindle n w/o the internet it wont do anything
B008602KQI|3.0|Movie was ok but there was so much they failed to explain. Heres A, now its B. Dont ask why, it just is! I know the movie cant match the book but they just left out way too much info.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|excellent, takes me back to my younger days. so much better then a greatest hits album. i listen to it often!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am a big fan of Fifty Shades so when I got the first to Bared to You books I wasn't expecting much, boy was I wrong! I can't really decide who I like more now, Christian or Gideon lol.
B00000JJQK|3.0|a little different then your typical beach boys. again i should have been more diligent in my research this time as well.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Downloaded this game for my 9 yr old when he's bored, works like a charm! I still love it as well!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app! Very addictive! Awesome! Can't stop playing it!  Love how real the horses and graphics are! Just wish I had more time to play it!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I LIKE IT IT KEEPS YOU INTERESTED YOU NEVER KNOW WHATS NEXT AND I HATE TO RATE THINGS WHY CAN I NOT JUST SAY I LIKE IT
0060531053|5.0|Livro extraordinario! Sensacional para o  iniciante e tambem para o usuario avançado. Excelente leitura ede facil assimilação.Muito bom mesmo.Recomendo.<br />BOM
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works great. Gale they sent me a new charging system.  Read review for power fast charger that this cord works with.
B001EOOC3W|4.0|This is a must if you are a Britten fan in this anniversary year.  The selections are from some years ago but are mostly acclaimed Britten interpreters.
159514188X|4.0|I enjoyed the interesting format of this book, first and foremost.  The narration is done through a cassette tape of a girl that committed suicide and left behind for the people that affected her life to listen to.  It is the last thing she leaves on the planet, hence, the thirteen reasons why she induced massive amounts of pills and killed herself.<br /><br />Each person she talks about is a different reason why, and is linked to a different story leading up to the last resort decision.  This book sounds like it would be terribly gloom and apathetic at first, but although it is in some ways, it is uplifting in that it shines some light through the eyes of the girl who commits suicide.<br /><br />Not many books come across this genuine in regards to the topic of suicide and depression, and somehow this fictional book does much better than other outlets (such as scientific magaizines, etc.) at showcasing what goes on.  More importantly, it shows through the cassette tape recordings, the events leading up to the girls' untimely death when she decides to take her own life.<br /><br />This book is written to shake people to the core a bit, and I think it does a fine job of doing so.  Somewhere out in middle-town America, in middle-town China, in all stretches of the world, there is a high school girl that took her own life in a similar way.  Only difference is, she probably didn't leave a cassette tape like the main character in this book does, and this is the author's attempt at showing the other side of suicide, from the perspective of the one who decides to leave, permanently.<br /><br />All too often,we only hear it from the other side, from the people that judge the person who decided to do so and cast blame.  I think the author does a good job of doing the other side at least a little piece of justice, in that the book makes you think and put yourself in the girl's shoes.<br /><br />Worth the read.  Worth the second read.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|While I may be more of a fanatic than a fan, I still think it's a great collection of material and that you don't need to be a completist to appreciate it.  The simple truth - this is yet another stunning example of the godlike talent that has now been gone for over 40 years, and yet we can't stop listening.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|I only used it for a short time, but it was better than the browser that came with my tablet.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect, since at first glance the premise could get thin.  But the book has a great roadblock/creative workaround theme that somehow consistently works.  It's fun to see how the main character overcomes these challenges, even though the science is way over my head.<br /><br />Once in a while a problem seems to get solved too easily.  And despite some good writing (much of which is dialogue-free), you have to overlook some cheesy speaker attributions which give the prose an amateur feel (the author needs to stop reading Lisa Gardner and Stephenie Meyer - not everyone \\"intones\\" or \\"sighs\\".  Sometimes they just \\"say.\\").<br /><br />All in all though a very good and fun read.
B000I186FW|4.0|The voices are hard to understand, because sometimes the background noise distorts / drowns out the voices.  If not for that, I would have given it 5 stars.
B003U4ZQUM|5.0|I love the whole series. I can't believe I didn't watch it when it was on live tv. A+ I would recommend to anyone who likes plot twists
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This will go down as one of the greatest mini series ever. Really good. Really really really really really good.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm hooked on Downton Abbey.  I really appreciate being able to watch several straight through.  Can't wait for season 3
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Treat youself to one of the best costume dramas ever. The acting is superb and the story is  engaging. Really engaging.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|There isn't much to say other than this product works great.  The coiled cord is long and pliable enough that I can stretch it out and set the phone on my lap.  The cord retains its shape well enough that it's not loose or malformed.  The iPhone 5 \\"Lightning\\" connector fit perfectly into my iPhone, and charged immediately.<br /><br />This product is compatible with the following items:<br />1) iPod touch 5th generation (32/64GB)<br />2) iPod nano 7th generation (16GB)<br />3) iPhone 5 (16/32/64GB)<br />4) iPad mini (8/16/32GB)<br />5) iPad 4th generation (16/32/64GB)<br /><br />The product even comes with a one-year warranty of sorts from Griffin Technology.<br /><br />A single downside from what I can see: The cigarette lighter insert is slightly L-Shaped, and I could see this being an issue with some cars.  If the cigarette lighter is recessed very much, the connection may not work correctly.<br /><br />I'll buy this product again if I need another car charger.
3836532441|5.0|This book is filled with lots of beautiful pin-up prints.  I ordered this as a surprise for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it.  Definitely a great purchase, and the price on amazon is hard to beat!
B0081336FO|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman make a great modern-day Holmes and Watson. The story lines are fascinating and the supporting characters also add to the series.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|One of the Beatles best. A must have for any Beatles fan. It's no wonder this was John Lennon's favorite and the sound quality on this is amazing!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I read the book after seeing the movie.  IMHO one of the rare cases where the movie was BETTER than the book thanks to the remarkable character portrayals in the movie.  The book is where the inspiration came from however and what a neat story.  Also a bit nostalgic for this 45 year old since the early 90s were a time I was still young enough to believe that mix tapes and finding your place in the world were important.<br /><br />I did tire at the end a bit of the letter writing format.  It would have been nice to have a small break from that format and augment it with some kind of strategically inserted normal prose, but that is just nitpicking.<br /><br />Overall a great read and look forward to more from Mr. Chbosky in the future.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|So many of the experiences ring true for anyone who has seen how large operations are run, even if they are a little dramatized.<br /><br />Most of the ideas presented in the book cover them at surface level  (managing WIP, configuration management, non-functional requirements, consistency between environments etc.)<br /><br />It is a good easy read and I think one consumable by executive level and technical management alike. The information is distilled excellently and it feels like a great jump point to start diving deeper in to more specific topics elsewhere (Kanban, Chef/Puppet etc.)
B00BLGZN1S|4.0|Interesting action film with an alternative history focus.  The acting is decent.  The facts close to the truth.  A great yarn!
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|My husband and I bought these cd's because we love Richard Thompson, who is one of the world's best guitar players.  Also wanted to familiarize ourselves with the songs because we were seeing him live.  Neither the cd or the live performance disappointed.  The songs, all written by RT, are great.  The cd is a pleasure to listen to.  If you're a fan, you'll love it!
0307716554|5.0|A school fire leaves a mother, Grace, and her teenage daughter, Jenny, critically injured.  Previously a victim of an unidentified hate mailer, the daughter may have been an intended casualty of an arsonist.  The author utilizes an unusual device for uncovering the facts: both women's spirits are able to leave their comatose bodies and communicate with each other but no one else.  We know that Grace went into the burning school to get Jenny out, but Jenny's memory of her own actions have some gaps.  As the background story unfolds, an avalanche of possible suspects, including a friend's abusive husband, a teacher who was fired, and Grace's young son, Adam, makes for a fast-paced suspense novel.  Each time I thought I had it figured out, I would realize that, no, my solution was too obvious.  Some reviewers have compared this novel to the work of Jodi Picoult, but I think Lupton deserves more credit than that.  I find Picoult's books to be melodramatic and predictable, whereas this novel is anything but predictable, except perhaps for the ultimate fate of the two main characters.  I found myself on a dizzying merry-go-round, as each new suspect and his or her motive came to light.  Fortunately for all concerned, Grace's sister-in-law, Sarah, is a tenacious police detective who relentlessly follows up on every clue, often unwittingly accompanied by Grace's invisible out-of-body spirit.  I did not find the supernatural angle to be distracting to an otherwise realistic plot.  In fact, I thought the author did an excellent job with this device.  She convincingly conveys Grace's and Jenny's frustration at having an almost omniscient presence, gleaning facts from scenes that they invisibly witness, with no means of sharing these findings with their loved ones.

B000R7GKQE|2.0|I LOVE THE SHOW BUT NOT SO MUCH THE DVD, IT HAS SUBTITLES!!!!! WHICH I FIND TO BE VERY DISTRACTING. ITS A LITTLE HARD TO WATCH THE SHOW.
B005XJLI5Y|5.0|will never go out of style,a film everybody can watch young and old as far as im concerned .kids will always love this film christmas time or any other time of the year.

B00127RAJY|4.0|After years of going to the gym and slaving on the elliptical or bike for an hour at a time and not seeing any impressive results or improvements in fitness, I'm a complete convert to the short but intense workout! Like Jillian says, if you want a short workout, you don't get to take breaks. But I'd rather spend 25 minutes a day<br /><br />Pros:<br />This is a great DVD because it's affordable, has three levels and requires very little equipment (just hand weights and a mat if your floor isn't carpeted). Jillian uses compound moves (exercising multiple muscle groups at one time) so you see overall improvement in less time. She also uses circuits of strength, cardio and abs to keep things interesting.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I started this with the intention of doing it for 30 days, but by the fourth day of Level 1, I found I was getting bored of the routine. Suggestions to get around this is to switch up the three levels (following the modifications for harder levels) or integrating other DVDs by Jillian or others into your routine.<br /><br />Overall though I recommend this to anyone, from beginners to regular exercisers. Jillian is tough but encouraging and the routines are challenging but doable!

B008JFUNYG|4.0|Sam Raimi may be more familiar to most people for being the director of the Tobey Maguire \\"Spiderman\\" trilogy or \\"Drag me to Hell\\" and even more recently by directing \\"Oz: The Great and Powerful\\". Yet, in 1981, when he was an unknown, he secured $90,000, some amateur actors, two-by-fours for camera rigs and went into the woods and filmed one of the most respected horror movies of all-time. Yes, \\"Evil Dead\\" 2013 is a remake and even though the original stands alone, I think it deserved a remake.<br /><br />The premise has been done and overdone and even mocked a bit in the recent \\"Cabin in the Woods\\", but that is just how influential the 1981 \\"Evil Dead\\" was to the horror community. The remake is directed by Fede Alvarez and produced this time by Sam Raimi and original star of the movie Bruce Campbell. Knowing this, I assumed that we would see the same movie with better technology. I was wrong. Don't go into the 2013 \\"Evil Dead\\" expecting to see the same movie. It's similar, but original.<br /><br />\\"Suburgatory\\" star Jane Levy plays Mia, a girl with a drug addiction. Her friends and brother have brought her to the `cabin' in order to have an intervention. This storyline alone adds to the original of just kids in a cabin. It gives the characters depth. As the events begin to unfold, you understand why the slow takeover of demons is at first undetectable. Not to mention, it gives you a place to feel comfortable with the characters before ripping the hope from your heart that anything good is going to happen.<br /><br />The depth of character was a huge added improvement to the remake, but the creators really slammed the gore into overdrive and something else was missing. The original was a gore fest in its own right, with dismemberments and pitchforks and cackling severed heads, but this time, they really poured it on. This is not a bad thing, although there was something the original had, that I didn't feel; a haunting overall mood.<br /><br />The original just felt creepy and quiet. Raimi let his camera work and the natural sounds do the work. Then when the shock moments happened, they were like something out of thin air. The unpolished nature of the 1981 movie was its best asset. This version, while still a good film, is polished. It has been hollywoodized and therefore loses that haunting, quiet, what-is-going-to-happen-next tension.<br /><br />This is not a remake of the same film. It is a remake, but it isn't the same film. \\"Evil Dead\\" 2013 pays homage to the original, but also goes off in its own directions and that to me, makes up for a lot of its downsides. Some of the moments that stuck in my head from the original are gone from the new film, but there are plenty new images to stick in my head from this one. The most shocking thing about \\"Evil Dead\\" 2013 is that this is Fede Alvarez's first film. Remember that name. He has a brilliant eye for lighting, camera use and settings, especially for a rookie.creepy and quiet. Raimi let his camera work and the natural sounds do the work.

B005PK56TA|5.0|Love this show. It is very addictive. Producers have done an excellent job with this series. It is like watching a movie instead of a TV show.  Keeps you entertained to the end.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat.Could not put it down.I felt like I was there with the characters.
B00C1C0WCQ|2.0|I enjoyed this movie as a 7-year-old when it came out in theaters. I liked it because it had dinosaurs and violence in it. However I am no longer 7 years old.<br /><br />Now my 2 stars may be slightly unfair because I experienced Jurassic Park remastered in 3D at my local theater not two days prior, but that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I felt embarrassed for Stephen Spielberg after finishing it; from the uninteresting characters (Ian Malcom is far less funny than in Jurassic Park), to the T-Rex romping around through downtown San Diego (spoiler), it was a bland and occasionally ridiculous ride.<br /><br />I recommend torrenting or borrowing this to preview it before spending any money on it. I wish I had.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Chose this because it is the BR/DVD/Digital package. I won't buy a movie nowadays if it doesn't have a DC with it.<br /><br />Excellent show and the quality of BR is even better than what we saw in the Digital Theater.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved Downton Abbey and I can't wait until they air Season 4. The acting was fantastic and the story line captured my interest from the very beginning.
B008220C56|4.0|To me, movies are subjective and everyone has their own take on whether they like or dislike something...so, this movie is different in the way it was made...I was expecting great scenic views (and there are a few) but it was mostly filmed in a theatre/opera house, etc. with move away backdrops...but once you get over that tidbit, you become more engrossed in the story.  Not for everyone; I viewed this through streaming prior to purchasing.  Always love Keira Knightley and it was nice to see her teamed up once again with Matthew Macfadyen.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Awesome series but the best part is that Amazon Prime has it and is easy to download just like when I've bought books or pink, plastic lawn flamingos.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love season 1 that's why I purchased the digital copy for season 2 on amazon & i loved it too Great show over all cant wait for season 3!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|It may have won the Booker Prize but it is an improbable read that gets a bit redundant.  Nevertheless creative in its preposterous proposition.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Do not miss this entire series and you will live their lives with them. Really a joy to watch this series.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|The tilt mechanism is difficult for me, so I did not enjoy this game. I liked the concept of the game though.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have never been so surprised by a book. Once I started to see the pieces I began to put them together but it wasn't until half through that I realized there were even pieces to the puzzle.<br /><br />I want to read it again. Never been so consumed by the characters of a book. Makes my life seem dull and meaningless. Thanks to my aunt for suggesting. Definitely a tear jerker so be prepared with a box of tissues! Enjoy!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love puzzle games, so it is natural I would be inclined toward Diamond Dash. The game offers similar ideas to Bejeweled, but the app is free and touch screen.
B000IZ0KRK|3.0|Fabulous sets and costumes and scenery, ok acting,  story line ran a little shallow and kind of corny at times.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|loved how Pi related everything about humanity by the obervation of his father's animals in the zoo.  We can all learn something by observing nature!
B003B02O14|4.0|Hard to stop reading even at 1;00 AM. Very detailed bur a bit disappointed with the ending. Good example of how moiney can be transfered.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|I have really enjoyed this group of songs.  I have laughed and sang and just throughly enjoyed another Native Texan singing.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Pretty accurate presentation of conditions in late 20's and early 30's. Somewhat predictable ion a lot of ways including the good and bad parts.
B008COII1Y|4.0|Pleasantly surprised,<br />Overall an alright adventure...nice zombies, civil war era Tennessee.  Could have done w/out the screaming from the lead character, kinda got old fast. Great narration, cool drawing storyboard animation was a gem.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This short story is thought provoking and with some fun twists. The protagonist was wonderful. So worth reding this one.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|i remember really liking the original footloose...but I was a tweenie then. i felt actually slightly embarassed watching this...I didn't know if I was embarassed for the actors/script or for myself gazing in on teenagers' lives. In any case, dancing was pretty good.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This puzzle starts out easy. However, the easy levels prepare you for truly more difficult levels later on. The hard levels don't overwhelm, leading to one giving up. Completing a difficult puzzle becomes very gratifying!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Very well written - keeps you wanting more. Treats a shameful part of our history in a realistic way while allowing us to be sympathetic and understanding of major characters. Having visited Williamsburg and the hospital that was in existence at the time of this novel, made it even more believable.
B003I55BIA|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK! NO WORDS CAN EXPLAIN HOW GREAT THIS BOOK WAS! I highly recommend it! Im looking forward to more!
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|legit show, I would recommend it to any family any religion any color any lifestyle any smell<br /><br />I love it
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This product was for gifts. I bought 3 of them and haven't heard any complaints and I know its convenient.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|This app allows you to search for all kinds of songs and display tabs or chords if available for the songs. With the large screen of the Kindle Fire you can play the song right from the Kindle. There are also bass tabs. A great program for guitar players.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|The movie was very poorly made, the plot was so unlike the original and was overall so lame that it effectively castrated the special effects.  And the acting was totally HORRIBLE!!!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show gets better & better! As a lifelong nerd, it is so gratifying to see a show that lets people know that nerds are cool too!<br />I hope that the relationship issues get worked out at the end like Howard & Bernadette. Nerds should get the girl too!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It was great to be able to see the entire season's production in a short time.  Downton Abbey provides a great look into the trials and tribulations of the aristocracy at a time when the class system in the UK is under threat.  As we all know, the upper classes have survived quite nicely thanks to the late &#34;Iron Lady,&#34; but it's still fun for a peasant like me to get a peak into the privileges of inherited wealth.  I wish the actors wouldn't leave the program.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|The American Horror Story is a great creepy story.  The stream line video had no problems.  I did have issues with purchasing some of the shows which Amazon did take care of.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is a great movie if you like English movies and the cast is wonderful.  If you haven't seen it, I recommend it highly.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I think this was a great story. I was spoiled by only having seen the movie. It is rather different than the movie but still a good read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is fabulous.  I can honestly say that no other show measures up in my estimation and I have enjoyed MANY &#34;hit&#34; television shows in my life!  Everything about the show draws me back for each new episode:  the music, the appealing way in which it is filmed, the scenery, the actors and the script.  All great!
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|I liked the movie it was entertaining just not what was expected I will watch it again it kept me entertained throughout I thought it needed a little more in the ending.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Love to connect with family and friends. Unfortunately Facebook's games cannot be played on my Kindle and it lacks a few other options. For that I use my desktop computer.
B000IDGDPA|5.0|This movie was interesting not at all what was expected very entertaining enjoyed the movie will watch again in the future
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very nice app. This is my go to calculator for everything. The numbers are easy to see and simple to use.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I have never read this author before but this book was recommended so I decided to read it.  I was not disappointed.  It held my attention right through to the end.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I play this to kill time or when I am just bored. It is a game of skill. Sometimes it is easier to figure out, other times it really pushes you to work at solving the puzzle.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I hate to review music, because each person doesn't like the same type of music.  This is well worth a listen.  Hugh Laurie is a super musician with a pretty good voice.  Not great, but just right for this.  I play this all the time while driving and can't help singing along.  Will buy the next cd when it comes out.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Tried this, but just not into this game. Geared more for the younger users. Great to play with friends during your free time.
B00BU8RNCE|4.0|Possibly one of most outstanding special effects film ever made?  There should be a disclaimer that no humans were injured in filming
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I downloaded this for my 7 y/o son to play.  It entertains him for a while and is a good time killer when he needs a distraction.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book has been criticized for the amount of violence it contains and for the way it describes mere children murdering other children for sport and entertainment, but that is not the point of this book. This book is an exaggeration of the world we live in today. We might not round up a group of children to watch them fight to the death, but you can go on youtube and find all kinds of videos of kids involved in a full out brawl, turn on the news and see story after story of children doing unspeakable things, especially when involved in a gang, and what about things like boxing, WWF, and MMA where people actually pay to watch two people beat each other senseless.<br /><br />This book is about the lengths that a young girl goes to try and protect and provide for her family and overcome the horrors of the world they live in. It also exemplifies the great power that one person standing up for what they believe in can have, and if you really want to, you can change the world for the better. For these reasons, The Hunger Games trilogy are my favorite books.
B00846WWVM|3.0|I downloaded this for my 7 y/o son, he finds it challenging but enjoyable.  I tried it too, and it is fun and challenging for me too!
B003JA5NUA|5.0|I love gilmore girls! And forgot how much of a gem season 3 is! Kirks victory lap to Rocky. JESS! Man it's good stuff. You'll love it!
B004W1GCNC|2.0|I have only watched episodes 1 and 2, but so far I am really not enjoying this series; I haven't decided if I will watch the rest.  I love Downton Abbey, so I thought perhaps I would enjoy this too.  This is a far cry from Downton abbey...which could mean that my opinion is totally biased and unfair.  Maybe I will give episode 3 a chance...
B009IEXKXI|5.0|At first glance I thought I was going to get bored.  Seemed kinda technical and a diary of sorts.  But after a few chapters it became very compelling and a enjoyable read,  Has some very funny parts as well.
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|I read this because everyone I know LOVED this book.  My husband and I both read it.  It was okay.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Love the cd.  such a beautiful voice!!  CD arrived in a short amount of time...price was great.  I love it!
B008I3RARW|3.0|I downloaded this as a game for my 7 y/o son, he seems to enjoy it and has not had any complaints.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I've not started Season 2 yet, but if it's at all as interesting as Season 1, it's a winner and a good use of time.  The costuming is great; the characters interesting, whether you love them or hate them.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|While there are parts of season 3 that I find disheartening, overall the season was a great one!  I look forward to season 4.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Overexposed is a the latest of great albums released by Maroon 5. Payphone is very catchy and Adam Levine is at his best on each and every track.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book captures the deep feelings of being unworthy of loving or being loved that children with unhappy childhoods feel.  Many of these children may start fires and readers of the book can feel the depth of Victoria\\"s rage that pushes her to this impulsive reaction.<br /><br />I share in the hope that book clubs and others will reach out to these children in need and make a difference in their lives.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I just stayed up til 1AM because I couldn't put down a case study.... What else do you need to know?
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|I streaming the movie, with was good and bad..good because gave me the chance to seriously triyng to buy the BD; bad because its filmed trying to be accurate to the times, hence a lots of candles and low light around.
B000BGR0OM|5.0|The Eurythimics were an iconic 80s duo. I thought Annie Lennox had such a powerful voice and together, this duo had some of the best 80s songs out there. Great CD with FAB music!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|showing some signs of aging...I think that the next one will be the last 007 with Danny...M and Q pass the torch already; so DC its the next one...my 2 cents...
B00BI745AA|4.0|I found the storyline to be very moving and some surprisingly good voices!  Russell Crowe! Who knew you could sing??
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I recommend this book  to anyone who likes a good read. It is jam packed with action, romance, poverty, riches, love, compassion, hatred.  I most definitely wanted to pick up Catching Fire as soon as I completed book one.<br /><br />A must read!
B008J05EL8|1.0|I should have believed the other reviews.  It doesn't open on my Kindle Fire so I see no difference.  Will pay more attention to reviews from now on.
B006UG90RM|4.0|Greta to hear the guitar more than the synth! Totally rocks, especially on the middle tracks. I recommend it to all VH fans.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|sweet game. its fun to earn new levels. my whole family gathers in the fun. more exciting levels every buy.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. Collins catches your attention and keeps you wanting for more.
B00APUYN0I|1.0|I tried several times and it would not download completely.  Only got to view the 1st 30 minutes.  Waste of money!
B0063M22QO|1.0|I found this app while searching for kindle fire hd apps. It has not been downloaded on my tablet and I bought it for nothing. I can't get it on my kindle fire hd 7
B004LROUNG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  I am a John Grisham fan, however I stopped reading his books after The Chamber.  This one is great!  I loved this story!  GREAT!
0812982622|5.0|I've read a couple nonfiction books about North Korea over the past few months, and this novel was entirely consistent with those -- telling me that the author did a great job at his research.  Then, couple that research with a wonderfully fascinating main character and captivating story line, and you've got a great read!  I've recommended to several others.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Story lines are engaging but not in boring, monotonous detail.  Characters are interesting and believable.  Season finale was anti-climatic but the show is still great overall.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|It took me awhile to figure out that the two main characters with different names were actually the same people (duh!), and by then I was hooked.  Although it's not the kind of book I usually read (ie., thrillers), at times it was so suspenseful I had to put it down to take a breather.  Glad I wasn't a single woman reading this at night by herself in a dark flat...
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I loved it. I loved the dynamic between the Doctor and Donna so much more than many other of his companions thus far. Highly recommend.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, I thought it was original, unlike anything I had ever read before. I couldn't fault it. I had a late night or two while reading it, I found it so hard to put it down and go to asleep. I just wanted to read more and more. I would recommend it for anyone between 15 and 50. I know it's aimed at young adults but I know more mature adults will enjoy it too.
B007REV4T8|5.0|&#34;Skyfall&#34; is probably one of the best Bond films ever.  The movie goes into the Bond character deeper than ever, right back to his childhood.  Instead of being a high tech thriller, this movie relies on a great script and fine acting.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Never watched this while on TV, but when I started watching this on Amazon Prime I could not stop.  The Shield is by far one of the best police dramas ever.  I became a Michael Chiklis fan, even though I had been watching him in new TV show Vegas.  The Shield was a much grittier drama.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A terrific action narative, with the most amazing<br />human nature angle I've ever read. Both men<br />have my extreme admiration. Well written from<br />both sides.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|If you like southern France and a good romantic comedy, the try A Good Year!  The fact that I would love to move to this vineyard and live in southern France makes it even more appealing.  Russell Crowe does a good job of it all and even though the ending is a bit schmaltzy, its still one of my favorites.
B009IUH1N2|5.0|this app is cool so far! the graphics are very good and decent! can't wait to see what's to come! the comic book graphics are really cool so far! I like how ninja Joe looks and he's cool so far! keep up the good work!
1597801585|5.0|This book intrigued me and I took a chance. Love it. I haven't finished it but it is a masterpiece in the speculative fiction genre. Thank you for the service.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|A great family movie. Watched it for movie night and the kids loved it, it entertained myself and my husband...always looking for good family friendly movies. Will buy this title (we originally rented) and add to video library.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This is by far the most fun phone game since the original snake came out on the nokia. lol, anger birds got nothing on little &#34;om nom&#34;
B004SOR4H6|4.0|This is so much fun! Easy to log in and boy is it fast!  Highly recommended.  It is an awesome app!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This series is just as good as Percy Jackson and the Olympians. The descriptions of the the characters and the references to the Gods let you feel like your in the story.
B0041D843M|5.0|Scary scary! We've got our nutrition facts backwards, and our dependence and love of animal-based protein is going to kill us all. I hope to change my dietary lifestyle before it's too late. Well-written and comprehensible to the lay reader, this book is based on solid scientific documentation based on nearly 30 years of research conducted by some of the world's most respected labs.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Pop up ads-watch out it is full of them. Do not download.  Get what you pay for.  Leave app at kindle store.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|Ethan Hawke, who always looks scared of something, looks scared of something in this movie, and that's a good thing.<br />The ending is part expected and unexpected.<br />If you like supernatural type movies you will like this.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is such a lovely story. I am not a fan of death books but this one is very different. There is so much real love and kindness in it.<br />I would recommend it to people who like to cry about a book but love to be inspired by hope in the same book.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I bought this for my Kindle because I needed it for a bookclub and had been unable to get a copy at the library.  It was a fun read and I read it in about a week.  It is very amusing and the author has a whimsical sense of humor.  He relates much of the book to incidents in history over the past 100 years and so although incidental to the story were quite informative about the events at the time.  Of course, much of the story is very far-fetched but as long as you realize that and read it for what it is, it is very worthwhile.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Expanded series coverage allows this to be a more 'on book' telling.  I like some of the older portrayals but don't miss the 60s & 70s hairstyles and makeup that plague some of them.
0062107062|5.0|I am not a big reader, but this is one of those books that you just couldn't put down at all.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great escape from reality... Imagination ran wild. Entertaining and keeps you on your toes. Will probably read this one again just to go back.
B00ANVX6DY|2.0|My girls were so disappointed...turns out this \\"movie\\" is just a compilation of episodes that they already saw on TV.  Bummer.  If your kids have never seen Sofia the First before, it's very cute.  But if they have seen it before then don't bother with this DVD.
B00BOLFRKW|5.0|I would be hard pressed to think of a movie I like better.  I felt like I'd gone back in time to witness great moments in our history.  I hope/no I feel certain this movie will find it's way into our schools basic curriculum and we will be better for it.  I also must say, I consider myself a little left of center in the political spectrum and noted with interest that even the pundits at fox news liked this movie.  Normally, that would give me pause and perhaps reason to reassess my position but I feel in this case the movie is so good that both sides of the spectrum can agree about it's significance. So Yes, I Recommend This Movie!!
0061950726|5.0|I remember at the age of 10 or so reading a novel about the late-19th and early 20th-century orphan trains, which took children and babies from East Coast slums and brought them to the Midwest, where they were given an opportunity for a potentially prosperous new life in the fresh rural air. Not until I read Christina Baker Kline's book, however, did I realize just how romanticized this version was. Orphan Train is a harrowing but ultimately uplifting story about this historical phenomenon.<br /><br />The novel starts in the present day, on the coast of Maine, as 17-year-old Molly Ayer is assigned to do 50 hours of community service as punishment for attempting to steal a school library book. Molly, a foster child who has a particularly tenuous and stressful relationship with her most recent foster mother, is worried about being sent away. So her boyfriend's mother, who cleans house for an old lady, Vivian Daly, suggests that Molly help Vivian clean out the boxes of old stuff that are clogging half of the woman's attic.<br /><br />Molly is not sure what to expect, or what Vivian will think of her. She has a Goth sensibility with the looks to match, including many piercings and tattoos. At first, her meetings with Vivian are hours to endure, but soon she finds herself absorbed by Vivian's story and astonished by the connections to her own life.<br /><br />Vivian, who immigrated to the United States from Ireland as a young girl, was originally named Niamh. When her entire family is killed in a fire in 1929, nine-year-old Niamh is turned over to a children's charity and put on an orphan train, sent to Minnesota in the hopes of finding a new home. Like Molly, though, Niamh's road to a loving home is anything but easy. After having made a fast friend on the journey west, Niamh is separated from him when she is not chosen at the first orphan train stop in Minneapolis. Instead, she arrives in a small Minnesota town, where she starts on a years-long journey toward finding something even remotely resembling a home. She's neglected, abused, overworked, underfed, and treated as slave labor. Only as a young woman is she finally able to find peace and something that looks like home.<br /><br />As Molly learns Vivian's story, the parallels to her own story become more and more clear. She comes to see Vivian as both a confidante and a friend, someone who can help her and who she possibly can help, too.<br /><br />Readers who are unfamiliar with this episode in American history might be surprised to learn about the hardships and be struck by the parallels between Niamh/Vivian's experience nearly a hundred years ago and the foster care system today. The afterword includes historical information, including a number of photographs, that will also help bring the period to life.<br /><br />- Norah Piehl

B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|Long movie, but if you enjoyed the LOTR trilogy, this is not far removed.  Unfortunately, I think this will be the best of the 3 Hobbit movies.
B00BR0LQ5K|4.0|I don't want to be long winded so here's a quick review. Perfect summer record for summer 2013.  Some very catchy tunes(redhands).  Kinda hippie'ish.  Could have done without someone i used to know cover.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I Like all of DeMille's books because of his dry wit in spite of dangerous situations.  His books are interesting and can be very exciting, because his cast of characters is aways intreaging and colorful. John Corey is the confident hero who rules...
B006LSZECO|5.0|Clever, witty, brilliant. It's amazing how Flynn can be both dark, yet funny in her prose. I was hooked from the beginning. I immediately ordered her two others books. I have found a new favorite author.

B002C6A6N6|5.0|My spouse and I watch this show together. We are up to season 4 now in this DVD set and haven't had a problem. It plays great, good quality. I was afraid to order after reading some bad quality reviews, but seems I get a good batch. Works perfectly!
B0091REZMW|4.0|its a lot of fun to play.  I like the quirky storylines. mystery manor is a fun way to waste time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of my favorite books now. I really loved it. It's been a while since I read something that just really made me feel good.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book is sad but real and amazing nothing is better then this book. NOTHING at all. I believe it is better then life.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Teen suicide is always difficult to understand.  Ms. Picoult did a good job of expressing the emotions of all the characters involved in this story.  Sad.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The  book was amazing. In my heart it was one of the best in the series.<br />Loved it. In my heart forever. This book made me want to read.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|Although the sounds, music, and video were beautiful (and the only reason I watched to the end) the story was disjointed and unclear.  I had to look up the movie on Wiki to even find out what the movie was about.  Maybe if I had done that before seeing the movie I would have enjoyed it.  A total waste of time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the costumes, the sets, the accents!  Love that there's something to watch without frenetic noise & action, blood & gore, swearing & sex, etc.  My favorite character is the Dowager Countess - Maggie Smith rocks!
B005K0HDGE|2.0|This book went on and on and on.  I rarely quit reading a book however this did not seem to have an end coming, just repeated the same story over and over.  I was too bored to finish.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Sure to become a 'classic'. Acting superb, singing natural and appropriate for the setting. Graphics and costumes well executed. Conversation starter. Brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|You're sure to recognize some of the actors in this delightful country tale of the late Victorian Era if you've watched Downton Abbey or Cranford. The series ran 3 and a half years.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It was much better done than I thought it would be...<br />For some reason I thought it would be a lot more blood and guts...<br />Heard there are more books, can't wait for them to be done in movies..
B0053O89IS|5.0|I love this show.  I am a collector of DVDs and hence was looking for it.  In Singapore, it is expensive and hard to come by thus I look for it in Amazon.  The DVD arrived earlier than expected and is in excellent condition.
B007FROGME|5.0|An interesting twist on the serial killer genre with the setting of Stalinist Soviet Union where such people are not supposed to exist. For those who understand it has a bit of a Star Trek ending but is otherwise a good story. I will read the next 2 books.
B0064MPXFA|3.0|its an interesting show for sure and better than most stuff you see on TV... It's not as good as, for example, Mad  Men or House of Cards... the legal scenes are pretty much not even close to being authentic (which of course, you almost have to do for a one hour TV show...)...I'm most of the way through season one and its pretty predictable...<br /><br />Bottom line, its OK
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am a Grisham fan- I appreciate the characters and the plots. The Racketeer is a good read. I am also someone who appreciates some sort of resolution at the end of a book
B0067R0APK|4.0|Seeing the new version took me by surprise!  Once you get used to the new layout, it is much better than the previous version!!!
B000060MMI|5.0|I have had many listening hours with this disc ell worth the money spent. Have no regrets and would buy this disc again if mine is ruined.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Wonderful story telling.  There is always risk in undertaking a book of 800 plus pages. Fear not.  I bought the hardcover and then was so caught up in the tale that, anticipating plane travel, bought the ebook!  Go for it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love. Love love love it!!!!Love love love love love love it!!! Love love love love it!!! Love love love it! !!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The ensemble cast makes this more than just a romp through the end of the Gilded Age and into the Great Depression. Neither working people nor aristos are glamourized, and their sensibility shows through their problems with the collapse of the world as they know it as they enter the twentieth century.  Constant tragedy is the stuff of this kind of story, and there's plenty to go around. I'm interested to see where it goes next, to find out who the new kid on the block will be, and to follow the adventures of Bates, my favorite character and the actor Brendan Coyle.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|Great product, always quality from Legos. I ambuilding the whole town, so this is awesome! It is a great addiction.
1594746168|4.0|As a youngster, I would absolutely love this book.<br /><br />Much like the \\"All About Ghosts\\" book that I read as a child, this book is set up as non-fiction.  For creative minds, I think this is a good thing.  Whether you want to believe ghosts or not, reading that book as truth as a youngster expanded my mind and really was a driving force in what is now my surrealist and non-conventional storytelling as a writer/director.  Sometimes it's okay to have children believe a little bit of fiction (for a while), especially if they are of the creative persuasion.  Of course, I don't mean you should lie to your children, but intelligent minds will be able to discern a little bit of fact from fiction.  If you teach your kids about Santa Claus, The Tooth Fairy, trolls, unicorns, fairies, whatever... same thing!  Sit down with them and let them know what is real and what isn't.  The smart ones will pick up on what's real and what isn't, anyway.<br /><br />As an adult, the writing seems a little lackluster to me, which is what leads me to believe this is probably geared at a younger audience.  I had a little trouble getting into the flow of the book, even though it is a fairly easy and quick read.  What is extremely intriguing is the second half of the book, with skeletal and muscular diagrams of non-existent beasts with a slough of scientific names that just make the book as a whole all the more intriguing.  Very bizarre, and in some respect a little scary... in the right hands, this could be a launching pad for young, active, creative minds.  No, it will not turn your kids into virgin sacrificing devil worshipers.  Unless you're just a bad parent.<br /><br />Bottom line, it is my opinion this would best suit the under 20 crowd (given the success of Harry Potter, that probably doesn't say much).  If you're into the fantastic, anatomy, Edgar Allen Poe, Edward Gorey... remember the Body Worlds exhibits?  If you were lucky enough to go to one and liked what you saw, this book is 100% for you.is 100% for you.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great variety of  stations, live and podcast.  Please keep adding more. live stations , especially US talk radio and sports.
B00B9JDBSO|4.0|Dark, haunting, eerie.  \\"Heartbeats\\" fanboys turn away, you will probably not like this album.  Though there is a familiar calypto steel drum presence that's present in their other work, is a far cry from \\"Deep Cuts\\"<br /><br />It is unfair to judge a band based on a million+ hit YouTube video that only popularized through that other guy with the guitar and that commercial with bouncyballs, but let's be honest... for most people, that's the genesis of The Knife's popularity.  Considering that, \\"Deep Cuts\\" which houses the infamous track is much less appealing to me than their new record, \\"Shaking the Habitual\\"  The former seemed more pop-dance driven and melodic, whereas this record could even be considered noise-based or experimental.<br /><br />There are ambient tracks, one lasting almost 20 minutes, as well as dark and atmospheric tracks which still resonate with the club/dance feel... but it's a dark feeling.  A reminder of the band's namesake, \\"The Knife\\" and just how not-exactly-happy their music really is.  For me, this is a very welcoming surprise as I am very much into dark, ambient music.  There is perhaps a twinge of black metal influence here as well, though take that with a grain of salt.  It doesn't mean you'll hear shrieking over wailing guitars and multiple drums.  I mean the Burzum type of black metal.<br /><br />The Knife is not for everybody.  Some will love this, some will hate it.  I personally think it is terrific, as it fits my typical musical interest. Sometimes it can be a little... abrasive? Just a little over the top as far as the looping and weird WAHHH sounds they throw in, but generally it is up my alley.  Listening to the samples on Amazon will definitely tell you if you will like this record or not.  I was happy with this purchase.
B000RPCK1U|4.0|Pierce Brosnan almost out Moore's Roger Moore.,  He does a credible role as James Bond.  The disk itself arrived well packaged and very quickly.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Very suspenseful and realistic.  Costuming very accurate for period.  Worth the rental, but would not watch again.  Generally a good movie
B0055OG2BC|4.0|This is a good comedy spoof of the 007 movies and characters.  It's entertaining and fun.  The shipper got this disk out very promptly and it was well packaged.  Thanks.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This is a great follow up to his previous work. Love how he has more of an eclectic flair to his music, unlike some other artists whose songs all sound the same.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This movie is required for anyone who likes musicals, or even doesn't dislike them.  Carol Burnett and Albert Finney were outstanding.
B006SAR6P8|5.0|Watch the first one then this one it's the best one out of the pair except the last one had the real epic battle
B00004WEJZ|4.0|At last, my collection is complete.  I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, but it was apparent that Sean Connery was not putting his best effort into the film.  Still, it was Bond.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I looked at quite a lot of calculator apps become I decided on this one. I found no advantage to purchasing an app for $4-5-6 except for the lack of small advertising space at the top.

B00009Y3L4|5.0|There is no other descriptor for this movie.  Minnelli was brilliant as the not quite fem fatale. Joel Grey was absolutely the bomb as the MC.  Great movie!
1451627297|5.0|I'm a late convert to Stephen King. I first realized his genius when I read \\"[[ASIN:0671024248 Hearts In Atlantis]]\\" and realized it was the best book of short stories I'd read since James Joyce's \\"Dubliners\\" (as a counterpoint, I read \\"Carrie\\" as a teenager and I didn't like it; does this demonstrate an evolution in Stephen King or me?). Then King made his claim as the modern day Poe in \\"[[ASIN:B006W3ZNRE Full Dark, No Stars]],\\" and in \\"11/22/63\\" King demonstrates his all around mastery of the written word and acumen for storytelling. In his novels, King has developed and remained consistent to the mythological Maine he has created, much as Faulkner created a mythological Mississippi in his Yoknapatawpha County.<br /><br />Stephen King has the uncanny ability to tap into the universal and extrapolate it to the literal. Usually, that archetype is a fear of ours, but in the case of \\"11/22/63\\" it's the urge to change the world. King is able to see reaction to every action, the concatenation, the clanking of kinetic balls, one event leading to the next, and the consequences of changing history and that even with the best of intentions we may not be able to see the full ramifications of the change.<br /><br />\\"11/22/63\\" is about High School teacher Jake Epping who, through his friend Al who owns a diner, discovers a wormhole or \\"rabbit hole\\" in time back to September 1958. Al talks Jake into going back in time and wait the five years it takes for 1963 to come around to stop Lee Harvey Oswald from assassinating JFK. But that is just like giving you the ingredient list of a lavish and extravagant feast. It pales in comparison to what you actually receive.<br /><br />King has the gift of a great writer, his writing seems like the events are unfolding as they would in life. Even good writer's books seem like projections of life, plots unfold in their books because that is exactly what happened. The writers plotted the book out as to what is going to happen, according to their wishes and their outline. \\"11/22/63\\" doesn't seem plotted or planned (undoubtedly it is), the twists and turns don't seem contrived, King doesn't leave the machinery visible, he puts it behind the scrim of the story, and the story, the action and the plot seem natural, like it`s happening in real life.<br /><br />\\"11/22/63\\" is a beautifully written book like looking at the Mona Lisa, or maybe a Picasso because as you follow one line of the picture being created it suddenly kicks off in another unexpected direction. King has a complexity of the characters that defies labels such as hero or villain. Jake Epping has killed in cold blood (albeit for an altruistic reasons), but the complexity comes to full force in the Lee Harvey Oswald character. King could have put Oswald in the strict confines of the villain and no one would have objected to that characterization, but King doesn't take the easy road and doesn't let the reader off that easily. Oswald is portrayed as a frustrated individual with visions of grandeur (with very little to back that assessment of himself) who beats his wife, but he's also portrayed as a loving father. As in life, these traits aren't mutually exclusive.<br /><br />Then there what are technically the sub-plots and ancillary characters. When Jake goes to Jodie, Texas and taking a job as a teacher and falling in love with librarian Sadie Dunhill is the main sub-plot of the novel, but it doesn't feel like a sub-plot it's just what Jake has to do waiting for time to bring him into contact with Oswald. Then there are the ancillary characters or what would be ancillary characters mere walk on parts in the hands of a lesser writer, become fully fleshed out and realized characters that make it seem as if King were writing from life instead of creating fiction (a scary thought, what if King is and always has written from life?).<br /><br />King has the confidence of a master writer in \\"11/22/63\\" he breaks the fourth wall between, writer, story andthe reader. He tips off the reader to the parts of the machinery behind the story without actually exposing the gears. Little touches such as noting that characters in novels never have to go to the bathroom, and as Jake works on a manuscript of his story King inserts lines like \\"...the manuscript you're now reading (if there is ever a you).\\" King also gets high marks in the verisimilitude department, those little details that make you suspend your disbelief and take the ride in the world the writer wants to show you. One that really grabbed me is that a car key is hidden in a Sucrets box. That is exactly right on! Everybody used old Sucrets boxes to store knick-knacks and King uses it brilliantly.<br /><br />You're going to want to read this book, FAST! Devouring the story to see what happens next, but don't, you're going to want to savor every twist and turn of this delicious tale. I've never been a fan of Stephen King's horror and he never veers too far away. That stated, \\"11/22/63\\" probably falls into the science fiction category, but to not read Stephen King would be the real horror.the reader.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|A really interesting and touching look at mental illness and how it affects families and relationships. There is a lot of serious issues addressed but the numerous touches are funnier than those in the film.
B00BF11STU|4.0|I haven't watched any movies about 9/11 or it's aftermath because it was our Pearl Harbor and I couldn't watch those movies probably for the same reason that the survivors of Pearl Harbor couldn't talk about it. We're all survivors of 9/11 because we all witnessed it and felt its impact in real time. \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" gives you some of that real time immediacy in the assassination of Osama Bin-Laden.<br /><br />\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" starts where the hunt for Bin-Laden did with 9/11, almost. There's a black screen while we hear the final 911 phone calls of those killed, and our mind fills in the images. The movie then follows CIA operative Maya (Jessica Chastain) as she goes on a decade long quest to find Osama Bin-Laden. She utilizes water-boarding, she loses friends to bombings, and finally tracks down Bin-Laden's whereabouts by tracking Bin-Laden's courier. Director Kathryn Bieglow (\\"[[ASIN:B0030MM68O The Hurt Locker]]\\", and \\"[[ASIN:B00AOQ8MOQ Point Break]]\\") utilized government resources that were available, but like any movie that is \\"based on a true story\\" you have to realize that some real life characters will be condensed into one character, chronologies will be juggled for more dramatic impact, and artistic license will create scenes that may not have really happened. Despite all that, Bieglow's \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" breaks through the fog of war, undeclared as it was and more of an exercise in intelligence than active war, and shows the true nature of war that is ugly and reveals truths about the inhumanity we can inflict upon each other. Any movie that tells the truth about war is inherently an anti-war movie.<br /><br />When the Navy Seal team moves through the building that Bin-Laden is hiding in during their effort to kill him, the movie makes no real bones about that being the objective, just as it probably was in real life. As the Seals move from floor to floor it has a weird resonance back to Bruce Lee's last movie \\"The Game of Death\\" where each level of the building is more and more difficult and brings a greater danger. The resolution of the movie isn't very satisfying even though we know Bin-laden was killed, but the Seal team isn't sure until Maya confirms it. There's no jingoistic, flag waving ending which there could have been. The movie started with the sounds of 9/11, it could have ended with footage of people running to the White House celebrating the announcement of Bin-Laden's death. Instead, the movie shows Maya alone, without a goal in life as her raison d'etre for living for the past decade is now gone.the building is more and more difficult and brings a greater danger.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I really loved the first book and would give it six stars if I could. But the 2nd and 3rd were disappointing. The writing was great but I wasn't happy with the character development.
1433524619|5.0|Awesome price! Great commentary. I would recommend everyone to by it. Very clear and simply English. Thanks ESV for this awesome bible
B008Y1YK0I|4.0|I already owned the dvd but I wanted the blu ray and I admit that it was some what clearer
B00B1R8TCM|5.0|What a treasure...new/old take on the blues...rockin, ballads, heart, and soul...some wicked lo-fi guitars and charlie musselwhite on the harp...YES
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Ugg... I have read and returned all four of these 'books'... This series has so many problems: The editing is amature and seems like a first draft,  The plot is slow and clunky, nothing really happens until the forth book. The fight scenes are awful! The author has no concept of warfare or weapons. No six months of training could ever make a handful of boys super warriors that could defeat a thousand trained adults, magic aside... The geography was confusing and at many times just stupid. How many lakes, valleys, or houses just appear to fit the author's stupid love story. The monsters are silly: Take anything give it two heads, a horn maybe some tusks turn it purple. I will not even talk of how insulting the dragon was... BLECH!!! I don't care if these are young adult books, we should not be exposing our children to this badly written trash!! I really should have know that anyone that gets popular with 'vampire' books as little or no skill!! I got my money back, but I will never get back the time I wasted on this series!
0142421715|4.0|I enjoyed this second installment of Ally Condie's. I feel like the second book was a little more interesting because we get to see what is outside of the main cities of The Society. We get to meet some of the Farmers and the Rebellion as well.<br /><br />Possible Spoilers Alert:<br /><br />It felt like it took a long time for Cassia to finally meet up with Ky. She was definitely more annoying of a character in this book. She wouldn't believe Indie about the blue tablets even though they were literally disabling her. I wanted to smack her on the head for being so dense! She knows at this point that The Society lies, why would she continue to blindly believe that those blue tablets were good for her? I know Xander gave them to her, but come on lady, use that sorting noggin'!<br /><br />It was also frustrating how Cassia and Ky finally got back together and then are immediately ripped apart again.<br /><br />One aspect I think would have been neat was a chapter or so in the minds of the parents. I think they know more then they said in the first novel, and they are non-existent in the second novel.<br /><br />While I wish there was a little more action, it was nice to see a different location and some additional characters. Still a decent book.
0553386697|5.0|As an educator for over 25 years, this is the book I will be giving to my children as they start their families. I wish I had had this type of understanding of a child's brain when I raised my son and daughters. Great scientific information written at a level that reaches all readers.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|My 9 year son loved the movie. There is a good social message too. I recommend it to all parents.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|I was disappointed and I like to watch a movie wothout reading reviews plot lines etc 1st. This had a confusing ending unless you already know its a serial and not a complete story. for me thats a waste of time
B005LAIHSG|4.0|I think the movie was good and I liked the actors and actresses that played the parts. It was a different twist on the Walt Disney version of it.
B00B1MHA18|5.0|This is an outstanding blues CD. Ben Harper wails with the best of them and I do not believe there is a better harp player than Charlie Musselwhite.<br /><br />Do yourself the favor and buy this one
B0045XICB2|5.0|I really liked this series and it does keep you on the edge. Makes you want to be a part of it and I did not want it to end.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Picks up the pace from Season 2. Great story and character development. Much more gruesome zombie slaying action. Rick goes nuts and comes back. If you are a fan of The Walking Dead series and have seen Season 1 & 2 then there is no reason not to watch this.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Can't go wrong with the classics...I can reread them, I can share them with the grand-kids, I can share them with friends, I can read the ones I always meant to read but never got around too...and most importantly -- they're FREE on KINDLE!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love British period pieces. Maggie Smith is superb as the matriarch of this complex family. It's amazing how similar yet so different the lives of the staff parallel each other.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Cant go wrong with the classics...I can reread them, I can share them with the grand-kids, I can share them with friends, I can read the ones I always meant to read but never got around too...and most importantly -- they're FREE on KINDLE!!!
B00AR83PN4|5.0|This game is mentally stimulating and really fun at the same time! I really enjoy playing this. It's tetrus on steroids lol
B0083Z614S|5.0|Can't go wrong with the classics...I can reread them, I can share them with the grand-kids, I can share them with friends, I can read the ones I always meant to read but never got around too...and most importantly -- they're FREE on KINDLE!!!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Because it has a good story,and greg finally gets a girl friend.The thing I didn't like is that they brokeup.
B008476HBM|5.0|Can't go wrong with the classics...I can reread them, I can share them with the grand-kids, I can share them with friends, I can read the ones I always meant to read but never got around too...and most importantly -- they're FREE on KINDLE!!!
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I love this book and would recommend it to anyone! Can't say the same about the last one though. I'm the kind of person that needs answers, you can just leave me hanging!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I like Wahlberg, an this movie makes the kids want too see it cause of the bear of course , but unless you don't care what your kids watch and hear , then there  ya go, but I personally did not like it, I took it out inside 25 minn, cause my Mother was in the room, I hide it so my kids couldn't find it. I did watch it later alone, an still not impressed,alot of vulgar language, an sexual innuendo from a Teddy Bear noless ,  a grown man with a bear?? Really? Watch it for your self if in doubt, I did, and I also read a similar review. Good luck. The King Family
B002VRZEYM|5.0|it told me the truth about meat. I am a animal lover my dream job is to become a vetenerian.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I liked Lincoin because it showed the emotions behind the historical facts,. Felt like I got an intimate introduction to Mr. Lincoln and others.  Would recommend to all, expecially History buffs.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|the game is very good but is getting to where every time I close it and open it back up later I am not as high in a level as I was before it was closed. fix this and it gets 5 stars from me.
B000BO0QHW|4.0|Whether his own compositions or covers of others, Norman Brown brings something sweet to the air. His arrangements for &#34;Better Days Ahead&#34; and &#34;Just Between Us&#34; are spot on.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|Finally started watching this after my boyfriend kept saying it was so great.  You do have to get used to a lot of blood being spattered around and I wouldn't recommend it for kids... but it really is well acted and has interesting plot lines.  What would you do if the entire planet came down with a virus?  :)
B001H4R4LQ|4.0|After watching Lord of the rings again I realized just how much of a copy the first book is but it gets better as it goes on
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Daniel Craig in the role that was made for him, along with &#34;Cowboys and Aliens.&#34;  Best of the Bond movies he's made, great villain this time too... but will miss Judi Dench a lot and wish she would've done a couple more in the series.  Love the new &#34;Q&#34; and &#34;Moneypenny.&#34;
B005OT2YVA|5.0|This movie came in great with great quality and streaming speed.  I would recommend this movie and others to view at any time.
B003V5ED7W|3.0|I thought it would be a little funnier, but nice story about the Olympics and the bobsledding team. A little contrived.
9056912445|5.0|Endgame books really have improved recently.  This book is a first-rate production all the way around.  New In Chess often just takes a chance on new authors and in my opinion, doesn't always do a good job of editing their books.  This book needed very little help in both readability, or improvement in instructive value.  In my opinion, the endgame is THE most difficult phase of the game to master because there are so many basic positions to remember.  This book references the common 100 seen in other places, but Dvoretsky believes that the number is over 200!  To make this more difficult, single movements of pieces can result in a totally different evaluation (knight's pawn versus rook's pawn etc. etc.).  So, the reader is left with coping with the desperate question \\"Will I ever see this position in an actual endgame and is it worth remembering?\\".  More often than not, the answer is no, that's why it's important to remember ideas and not positions.<br /><br />Remembering positions is exactly what the author discourages and instead emphasizes the need to understand the ideas to better have a feel for the exceptions.  But more so, I really think playing over every single endgame has ingrained into my brain some of the basic ideas that will lead to good technical execution of a position.  The other benefit is that during the middle game, it's easier to evaluate won endgames and simply dismiss some options as unfavorable for one side or the other.  Why is this important?  Playing a pawn down for initiative is a great way to win a chess game, but you have to be dead careful not to leave yourself in a lost endgame if your initiative fizzles out.  This is why it's important to know what is won and lost if not by heart, but at least by intuition or possibly by selective calculation.<br /><br />The nice thing about this endgame book is that it probably is everything you'll ever need to fundamentally know about the endgame.  Of course, it will take multiple readings for most people to absorb all the material, but that's the nature of highly complicated, yet beautifully simplistic positions such as those that arise from the endgame.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The movie is a realistic look at the American family.  The book varies slightly, but still has the same flavor.  Love the author's &#34;voice.&#34;
B000PMLFRA|4.0|I thought I was getting the uncut, original theatrical versions or else I'd give it 5 stars. My bad for not doing a little more research.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|This was not as exciting as I expected it to be after having read the books, but that's to be expected I guess.  The movie was well done, tho - actors were chosen well, sets and special effects were excellent. I would watch it again.
B000000JO3|5.0|It's Minor Threat buffet on one disc. You can't beat it. Unless you throw it on the ground and stomp on it. You can beat it that way.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a series I can recommend to anyone without feeling like it's too specific of a genre.  I personally like books that have beautiful imagery, great character development, and interesting language.  Hugh Howey has a very clever way of describing things without getting too weighed down in details.  It's a perfect mix of an exiting, page-turning plot complete with witty wording and characters you care about.<br />HIGHLY recommended, you will not regret this read.  Nice work Hugh!!
0307346609|5.0|I love Zombie movies and TV shows; however, I do prefer to read something a little more stimulating that a Zombie book. That said, this felt like more of a post apocalyptic world that just happened to have Zombie, Very interesting, quick read.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|Too hard to navigate<br />Instructions were hard to follow<br />A bit darker than expected<br />Would not play again -too bad
B0009S4IKQ|5.0|All-star cast, great story...John and Lionel Barrymore are incredible. Joan Crawford is gorgeous, Wallace Beery is sneaky and evil. GREAT FILM!
B00BFTV09K|3.0|Michael's book is a great encounter with the American food industry. However sour it might be..  It adds to all the information currently known on nutrition and health and again, warns us all to stay away from processed foods. It has me thinking that there should be an oath that could be taken by the food companies ie. \\"first do no harm\\", and concurrently we consumers should also be considering an oath to ourselves along the same lines. Food for thought..
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This is one of those books that you read just because you read the other books. I found the love triangle annoying and more like a soap opera, rather than it being engaging. I also ended up not liking Katniss as much by the end of the book (mainly because of the way she handled the Peeta and Gale love triangle). The book wasn't horrible and I still think anyone who read the other books should read it, if for no other reason than to see how it ends.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|Diving in the Caribbean made the underwater pictures great. I took the little string loop it came with; tied it to lens; the secured the other end of the string through the slots near the screw part. This way, if the lens came off it will still be attached to the GoPro and not float away. I need the other color lens now for freshwater snorkeling. Recommended!
6305265666|5.0|I love this story, and Drew Barrymore has always been a favorite in our house. This is an awesome movie!
B007STXHTM|5.0|My first dive in the Caribbean with my GoPro and this cover plus the red snap on filter. I was afraid water would get in as it was so easy to close up the camera in the case. It worked Very well.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|What is there not to like? I LOVE Justin Timberlake, he is the all around talented man, Mirrors is my favorite!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is totally addictive. You can burn through a lot of battery time and your own time.  The only negative is that it takes a lot too get new characters and boards.  Other than that, this game rocks.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|I love that the series follows more of King Henry's reign than just the period of Anne Bolyn.  I would recommend this series!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|My daughter read the book series and enticed me to do the same. The movie holds reasonably true to the books. The movie is fun but especially after reading the books it is thought provoking as well. At first while interesting it seems far fetched, but after thinking about it a bit more it may not be as far fetched as we would think.<br /><br />Look at the reality TV shows. If there really was a hunger games most people would tune in to watch.<br /><br />Think a government won't suppress and lock down it's people look around the world. Syria is an active example but there are many.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to the next movie in the series later this year.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|An imaginative, well told story. I liked it a lot.  Liked the elements of whiskey, wizardry and reality. A good read.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|A great story with a twist or two.It keeps the readers interest the whole way through although I was slightly disappointed with the end.
B00C10N3EW|5.0|I watched Joe's An Acoustic Evening on on NPR and was thoroughly impressed with his music. The CD download is a great addition to my Blues Collection!
B002RSDW80|5.0|This is a wonderful movie! funny. very entertaining. just a very enjoyable movie to watch. I am so happy that I bought a copy of it here on Amazon. After watching the movie I also purchased Julia's french cookbook that is mentioned in this movie (the combined full version of it). this movie will make you hungry! :)
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|A reminder of how disconected we are from our sorroundings and our companions in this journery.<br />A gentle and shake-up call to be aware!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Extremely good writing. The characters brought you in from the very beginning and I was addicted to the last page.
B0012DP8A6|4.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE, I GOT THIS FOR MY 7YEAR OLD....SHE LOVES THIS MOVIE AND WATCHES IT ALL THE TIME....IT WAS IN GREAT CONDITION
B004ZNACA6|2.0|The music in the set is obviously phenomenal, but the condition of the box and the cd holders are abismal. It looks like this was stored away in the corner of a back room somewhere because every corner on this box is dented. I do appreciate the &#34;Fragile&#34; written on the box, but honestly it wouldn't make a difference if this is how it was originally shipped. I definitely will not be showing this to my loved ones. What a shame.<br />But again, the music included is life changing, so there's always that.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|I've seen it before but I love Mark Wahlberg. Natural born actor!  I do recommend this movie. If you haven't seen it, its a must see movie.
B003Y5H556|5.0|My fiance and I are big Amanda Seyfried fans, so we love this movie.  :)  Had to add it to our collection!
B007REABAG|4.0|This collection obviously leaves out the last 20+ years of the band [since it stops at 1990] when their contract was up and they went elsewhere [small labels mostly].<br />Unlike other \\"collections\\" at least Epic included the remastered albums where possible as well as bonus tracks and of course the 2CD version of Budukan.<br />Of course don't expect much in booklets or packaging.
B008M0UTRO|3.0|The central figure leads almost a Cinderella life - both parents gone, hours of housework before and after school, and little if any chance to explore the mysterious world of boys. But, despite some reversals along the way, she reaches a happy ending.<br /><br />There's not much overt action here, except when Umi brings her domestic skills to bear in saving a beloved landmark. Really, it's more the emotional rollercoaster ride of a girl's early teen years, an animated chick flick. And, sad to say, I review this with the sensibilities of a non-chick person.<br /><br />I can't fault the animation, though. The characters are skilfully drawn, but the backgrounds are glorious. Luminous, painterly, elegant - when the plot dragged, I let myself fall into the gorgeous background artwork.<br /><br />-- wiredweird (reviewing the English-dubbed version in theaters)
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Doesn't seem like this is an accurate portrait of teenagers today. I considered putting it down and calling it quits. Very predictable.
141659521X|5.0|As alway with a Mitch Rapp novel from Vince Flynn it was a compelling page turner! Once started Mitch Rapp stories are hard to quit before you're done. Action is realistic and believable with a story line right out of todays headlines.  Vince Flynn is a must read author for any fan of political thrillers!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The movie makes you think beginning to end!  It is one of the best movies my family has seen in awhile.  Great for any age.  I would watch it again!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I'm only lvl 6 right now, have to be 10 to access the sea part. Takes quite a bit of time to lvl though. Its you basic zoo story style game, just dinosaur from what I've seen so far. Still, pretty neat, and you don't have to feed within a certain time or anything, so that's a bonus, otherwise I would delete. I figure once you lvl higher, it's more than likely going to be easier to lvl and gain goods and money. First 10 lvls are considered training.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher may be getting older but the books are still fresh.  Lee Child still manages to keep the Reacher series full of excitement and you on the edge of your chair.  I love trying to puzzle out all the mysteries - and there are plenty in this one!  I love it.
0451228731|5.0|This book really makes you think about what the future may hold.  As we speak, google is creating automated cars, anyone can purchase microprocessors and connect them to the internet.  I don't think we are far away from having something like this happen in the real world.  It is just a matter of when someone thinks they can make it work.  Very good book.
030746363X|5.0|The Four Hour Body is less like a weight loss/exercise guide and more like getting exclusive access to a brilliant and determined mad man's quest to find the most effective path to physical health goals. There are no gimmicks; there is no insisting that one buys a certain product in order to succeed. It is Timothy Ferris using himself as a guinea pig and sharing his results.  The Four Hour Body shows the most effective efficient, no bull path on how to subtract fat, gain muscle, improve your sex life, sleep and heal better, run like never before with more strength in a quicker amount of time. The Four Hour Body enlightens the exercise and health layman on how to achieve the most healthful quality of life.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow!  Spent several nights burning the midnight oil until I finished this!  Can't tell you much without spoiling it.  Don't miss reading this one!
B0037NVM1I|5.0|I think by far the best one in the franchise!  This is for sure one of my go to movies for action/adventure.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Like season one and two, this will keep you glued to the screen until the end of the last episode!<br />Sure wish we Americans could/would produce something on this magnitude, rather than waste time and resources on the trash currently available.
B008OOYALE|4.0|My daughter and I have fun playing it together. We also get practice with statistics for figuring out the chances we'll get certain dragons when breeding them, and what colors mixed will make what.The downside is that breeding takes 12 hours, then it's another 12 hours to hatch the egg, and if you feed it enough to evolve it right away, it's another 12 hours.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Hi,You have great apps but they are limited to you own web site and I think it's time you all got to get her and allowed us to use other website also you have restrictions on what country you are in, don't you think it is time collaborate with the other supplies to allow us to down load some of there apps.<br />Regards Albert Crabtree.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|I'm an adult and I loved this movie! Lol I think its a great movie for kids and adults to watch!
B008M87GJK|5.0|I've been looking for some time to find some straightforward way of getting concise news from around the world and this app fits the bill........I can even NOT have news, such as sport! Wonderful!
B0043WDK2G|4.0|Like the mystery and romance of a series. Holds my attention and plus gives entertainment that most TV shows do not have.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey series is my favorite shows of all time. Love the English wit, scenery and family committments. The characters are unique and well acted.
B003TH14H4|4.0|Do not like the comedies that are so blah, and no real entertainment. Find that the actors of this series have found a real chemistry working together, and it holds my attention.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I'm pretty liberal when in comes to movies but this thing was rarely funny and mostly just disgusting. Consider a teddy bear having sex (graphic and more) with a woman. Save your money.
B005O7PXNS|4.0|Was a fan of closer and find this is the next best series to Closer. Like a Mystery Romance series.
B000MYFILK|4.0|Wow, she's a teen, she's gorgeous, and Peck almost shows some emotion.  Still, while Rome is the perfet setting for love, I don't see the passion we would expect today. Is this aloof love just an artifact from the 50 -60's?
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I thought that the general storyline was plausible and entertaining. I would recommend you at least watch the first few episodes.
630514415X|5.0|Favorite basketball movie of all time! So glad that I found this older movie at a really cheap price! Thanks
B007SGLZP8|5.0|No exactly as i predicted. not typical Grisham.<br />i enjoyed it greatly and would recommend highly<br />It was good fun.
B001TH16DI|4.0|I got really connected with Star Trek after the recent movie in theatres. Then I started watching every chapter in Netflix streaming. I think the imagination of the writer, director and actors must have been incredible in order to put these movies and series in place at that time and era. My only issue is with my Blu-ray DVD player Samsung HT-C6930W/XAA that is not playing most of these movies, maybe an update is needed in order to play them.<br />I would recommend this collection to anyone that is interested in having one of the best Science Fiction movies/series ever!
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Johnny Lee Miller is exceptional! Great twist on an old favorite. Sherlock like you have never seen him before. Love it!
B0076DELIG|3.0|I am a Harry Bosch fan. In this novel as usual , which is a good  thing, Harry fights  for justice on behalf of every person that has been wronged which in  this novel was a murdered reporter that was the subject of a cold case that Harry solves.<br />  The story is intertwined with Harry's relationship with his daughter and his girl friend Hannah  and is a welcome retreat from Harry's relentless and intense investigation process<br />  The only negative was the narrative that Michael Connelly  writes about dealing with the old manual way investigations were conducted back in the day as compared to the technological  advances of today's investigations. In my opinion that detracted from the main story line of connecting the dots.<br />  Overall I enjoyed reading the novel and was left with the impression that Harry Bosch is every persons hero.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It isn't even about the Zombies anymore...great show! Love the suspense, characters, general story...amazing. Highly recommend you check it out.
B007SGM084|5.0|OMG  I couldn't put my kindle down.  I truly loved the books.  Some stuff was kinda repetitive, but all in all, truly a great trilogy...
B007SGM084|3.0|The author did a fantastic job in keeping me interested enough to finish book 1, and after realizing there were 2 more books, managed to keep my interests to read them  as well. However, I found the books to be just shy of a good climax (no pun intended), as I was expecting a stronger one. The story line was well done as I refer to the ending tying it all together beautifully. The idea of reading through the development of Christian's character and his progress, and then adding HIS point of view after the epilogue in Book 3 (taking place near the beginning of Book 1) , really emphasized his extreme change in personality from Book 1 to Book 3. Very good idea adding that to the end of the trilogy.
B00ANYJ3NI|5.0|As I was about to board my United flight from Sydney to LA I was shocked to hear that there was one television on the whole plane. In my state of panic I headed into the airport book store and after looking around for a while came across this book. I had previously read \\"The new new thing\\" and loved it. So I hoped this book would hook me the same way. It definitely did that, to the point where I couldn't put it down and ended up with a sore neck. A great insight into the GFC and Wall St. Was also effective hearing this story from multiple perspectives.
B000PH40HM|5.0|My favorite movie from Arnold Schwarzenegger, I really love it. I could see it over and over again. . .
030746363X|5.0|This has been by far the best reference guide for health and fitness and injury prevention I have ever come across. I have been in the H & F industry for over 10 years and have read probably too much about unimportant stuff. Tim is an expert at telling you the most effective parts of the exercise, diet or method and scrapping the rest. I have even been able to get my parents to follow techniques in this book and actually stick to them.

B00B49L7JY|5.0|Five stars! I enjoyed watching the rental download and highly recommend it. The producers deserve much credit for telling the story of how profoundly music can influence cultural attitudes.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As good as the 1st book....looking forward to the 3rd. Kept me in friends and on the edge to read more
B00ARI9CDQ|3.0|This app probably has more information that I wanted for my tablet since I also have other apps that gather the same information.
B00AA0U05A|4.0|Yes, I did enjoy this CD. Most of the songs were songs I from the past. I liked the choices and the arrangements were quite intersting. I would buy another CD similar to this one.
B008RXYOKY|3.0|I cant tell the difference of thunderbolt and the old USB..... all I know is I bought the apple brand adapter hoping it will work flawless like my old mac USB connections but it doesn't. The hard drive falls asleep and you have to wait for it to wake up before you can use the photos, videos and music I store on it for iphoto. Overall....if it downloads 1 millionth of a second faster than old USB technology you still have to wait 3 or 4 seconds for the external hard drive to kick in.

Great music too.  [I wish Werner had done &#34;The Cliffs of Moher'.]
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|Despite I kept falling asleep during the movie the first time I saw it I was really tired and it didn't have enough fast pace to keep me up. I still think it was a good movie though and still had the same magic as the other series. It has been a long time since seeing the Lord of the Rings series but this one seemed to try to be more of a comedy and that sometimes bugs me. I will have to watch it again when I feel awake and give it another shot.<br />Update.... I think this movie has a orc spell on it or something. I just cant stay awake to finish it. Now I don't want to finish it. I have never come across a movie that I could not at least watch the whole way through good or bad.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It is a really good movie but of course the book is even better. Hope you enjoy them both. smile!
B0053XM7ZU|5.0|Another great instalment to Game of Thrones and more unexpected events unfold. Needless to say, I'm ready to start the next book as soon as this one was finished. Complete page turner.

B00B5HQKNI|5.0|we watched the whole thing - were kept entertained exactly what we hope for out of watching a movie.  thanks
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Season two of The Borgias is riveting. Buying it was a toss up after watching season one. But I was interested in the subject matter, so I decided I would give it one more season to decide. I am so glad I did, it is easily as good as any of the other current mini series, i.e. GOT, Spartacus, etc. The corrupt Borgia Pope is brilliant and likable, he is unorthodox, as is his family. If you haven't seen season one then you will need to view it to get to the masterpiece that is season two. You will not regret it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think the reviews helped me and hope they help you. cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool. Awesome awesome.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|As a child of the 80's, I knew I would like this movie.  Add in the fact that I absolutely adore musicals, it was a flat out winner for me.  It's a good thing that I didn't see this film in the theater cause I would have annoyed the crap out of fellow movie goers.  The only thing that could have made this movie better was a sing along version, but who are we kidding, we know all the songs by heart already!  Oh, and Tom Cruise shirtless through most of the movie?  Yummy!<br /><br />This is not a deep thinking movie, it's just pure fun, enjoy it!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel Washington is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of our time. If you like drama with deep analysis of people and their behaviour from a main actor and supporting cast that can make it believable then you'll like this movie.

B000AAF1U4|5.0|No matter how many times I see it I absolutely love it! Plus it was in good shape. I chose this title because it is funny.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I literally inhaled the series, was a litte concerned because some of the reviews, but once I finished reading I think It hardly could ended any other way.<br />Spoiler Warning.<br />For those who think they are going to find Katniss has returned to her old self from book one, well, you are going to be desapointed, in fact non of the carachters are the same at the end, well, maybe Haymich is, but, honestly, who could ever be the same after what they been trough?.<br />Maybe I'm a bit of a prude, but I would'nt say it's recomendable for someone under fifteen, but been mother of a toddler and a 9 years old who is soooo sensitive maybe has some influence on me.<br />Now, my only complain is what am I going to read now???!!!, I have something like \\"Hunger Games withdrawl\\". :)
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app. it is the best picture app there is that is free. there are so many things and stuff that you can do with pictures and/or without. I love it it is my fav.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|We had seen this movie in the theater and we all loved it..(me..hubby..daughter)..so I got this dvd with eggs for my daughters Easter gift..she has rewatched the movie a bunch of times..it is a creative and delightful story about the guardians..is protectors of Easter..Santa..Tooth Fairy..Jack Frost..and the eggs were a fun side gift!!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Really like this game, especially arcade mode. It is challenging and sometimes gets very frustrating but great for killing time and can be addicting
B009AMANH4|5.0|Didn't get to the theater to see this and looked forward to the dvd/blue ray..I am sure there is nothing I can say that hasn't been said (not to quote the Beatles..but I think I just did)..what a great movie about a very smart and thoughtful man. I really liked that the movie focused on something other than his assassination for a refreshing change of history!! there is so much more to this great man than the way he died!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Loved this movie. I love all dreamworks animated films and this just topped the list of best family/kids movies ever! My 5-yr old loved it too, but my 2-yr old was not into it
B005LAIII0|5.0|Didn't know a thing about this movie..got it for an Easter gift..what a beautiful movie..the scenary is to die for..and the story is so thought provoking..my 7 year old even &#34;got it&#34;..I thought about the mivie the whole night..how we choose to tell our story..what others want or can see and hear..great family movie.
B000B589JI|5.0|It is a very good product, I would recommend it to anyone with a Zippo lighter.<br /><br />I have not experienced any problems with fuel leaking, there is good contact with the O-rings, you can feel the resistance when you start to screw down onto them.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|A well made movie. Costumes and makeup were great...acting good, too.  A thought provoking concept, but think I prefer growing old rather than growing young.
B00BS4PAXO|5.0|I wasn't sure what what to expect when I bought this album but I was blown away and haven't stopped listening to it for days!  My favorites are \\"God is Here\\" and \\"In Jesus' Name\\" but every song is great.  Lyrical quality is superb and the overwhelming message is love, gratitude and praise for Jesus.  You won't be disappointed!

B00742GBDM|2.0|\\"Austen purist\\" or not this movie is mediocre, and if you're watching it to understand Jane Austen's MANSFIELD PARK, you will be (or at least should be) greatly embarrassed when you get to class, or book club, or whatever, because it will teach you nothing.  These characters, although they share names with the novel's characters, are in fact so little like them that I can hardly tell they're related.  There are better versions out there: Billie Piper's all right as Fanny, although still too \\"pretty\\" and forward to truly like Fanny; the 1983 BBC miniseries is much better, and embodies more of the subtleties of the novel (yes! It has subtleties!).  But this one is pretty much terrible.
B0043X1FL8|5.0|Showed it to my ninth grade biology students when we were studying the human nervous system. Williams and Deniro had them laughing, crying, and really taking to heart the human condition. Far better for them than spongebob..
B00571F26Y|3.0|Davis' thesis is interesting and well-supported, lots of science. Although a bit annoyingly written (cute little asides detract from the reading), easy to get through, even the technical parts. HOWEVER, like most believers, he seems to pass over a few facts which would detract from his point: For example, post-menopausal women typically gain weight in the belly area, and it has nothing to do with wheat. I tried going off wheat and it did not help my belly (I have a diabetic shape, the 'apple,' but am not significantly overweight) and a friend went off wheat for a month to help joint pain (as he says it would) and it did nothing for her.

B009CV7IIA|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic book which brought back a flood of memories for me. If you grew up in the 1980's and spent time in arcades, with an Atari 2600 (or in my case, a Sears Video Arcade), or typing away at a Commodore 64 or Apple II, you'll honestly feel as if this book were written for you.<br /><br />Kudos, Mr. Cline!

This story has definitely made me open my eyes and take a closer look around.<br /><br />Named for the title,  13 reasons why you should read this.<br /><br />1- Hannah, a lot of people can relate to. Those deep dark feelings. The sadness and pressure, the rumors, the mistrust and betrayal. It's all real life circumstances.<br /><br />2- Clay - the person we all wish we could just open up to and everything out.<br /><br />3- this novel makes you stop and think. Wonder if you do something differently, how it can and probably will affect someone else.<br /><br />4- it's the ups and downs of a high school student.<br /><br />5- you can hear the character telling the story in your head, you connect.<br /><br />6- it's real. Happenings like this happen every day and no one thinks about it. About how it makes others feel.<br /><br />7- see the signs, know the signs.<br /><br />8- do you remember your first kiss? You will now.<br /><br />9- what about that girl who was supposed to be your friend? ..<br /><br />10- rumors suck. Everyone thinks they know the real story, but in fact that's all it ever is.<br /><br />11- you will realize you can help someone out there by just saying the right thing...or by not walking away.<br /><br />12- you will find yourself wanting a happy ending.<br /><br />13- finally, this book will make you think and feel as never before, about you and the people you know, about your past and future.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game was the reason for my purchase of the additional series that I currently have on my Nook. My grandson was especially intrigued by the game and actually taught me how to play it. While it may keep the kids free and quiet, it is not mindless in the sense that they are not learning. Evrytime I go over to see my grandson, he reminds me to bring over the Nook. Since he has an iPad, we compete by playing the same game-me on the iPad; him on the Nook.

B00BMEF6IO|5.0|I bought this piece on a whim. Not that I haven't been a fan. Having pre-ordered the ever long titled 'There Is A Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is A Heaven, Let's Keep It A Secret' I would say I've contributed to their success. To my surprise, this album is a greater achievement. But, let's take a second and reminisce: hasn't every album been better in some way than the prior? Hasn't every album been entirely different? Their debut, a Deathcore monster, blew them up. Love and hate gave way to a growing fan base and success. 'Suicide Season' followed with a more Metalcore style with a bouncy attitude and, not to mention lightly, a much better production value. Then, the following 'There Is A Hell' proved to be an evolution of sorts with a new array of elements in the music (choir, synth, singing, acoustic guitar). Finally, this beast, is certainly the outcome of it all. Strong anthem-like lyrics coinciding with powerful rhythms and leads. The addition of a keyboardist gives air to a new side of their sound, which surely fits, and gives new life to the music. This album is full of hits, and I'll be sure to sing along at this years Warped Tour.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|This album is a little bit faster than their old one. It is a GREAT CD and I especially the first song. I've already listened to it like a million times. The lyrics are pretty good too. If you like The Fray or The Script, I think you'll especially like this.
1590171993|5.0|William Stoner is a farmer's son who goes to college to study agriculture just before World War I but who falls in love with English Literature and a girl named Edith, who becomes his wife. Their marriage is disastrously unhappy relieved only by their daughter, Grace, who Edith eventually uses as a weapon against him.  Stoner's miserable life is relieved briefly by another college professor, Katherine, who becomes the true love of his life and his intellectual companion as well. They will both pay dearly for their short-lived happiness. This is a sad story about a virtuous, dedicated college professor who seems to suffer one loss after another and yet who manages somehow to retain his dignity and to achieve inner peace. Stoner is a modern day Job who remains absolutely true to his convictions.

B00B97SNJI|4.0|\\"The center keeps on drifting/The music never stops.\\"  \\"Just Beneath The Surface\\"/Taylor Goldsmith.<br /><br />Simply put-if you liked DAWES first two albums (especially the second)-you'll like this too.  It has that same sound and feel the band's known for-sort of that Laurel Canyon/1970's vibe, but with a definite growth in their sound.  They've updated their sound since the last album and it shows.  For example, listen to \\"Bear Witness\\" for a vocal reminiscent of Jackson Browne but with a tighter band sound.  The lyrics speak to deeper things than on previous albums, showing Taylor Goldsmith's maturing as a songwriter.<br /><br />The band have moved on from that 70's California/canyon sound.  For one thing some of the album was recorded far from L.A., in North Carolina.  This album-full of good songs-is the band stepping away from the \\"vintage\\" sound they're known for, and they've used an outside producer new to the band.  And it's all for the better.  After touring extensively the band is tighter than ever.  Their level of musicianship has grown since the last album.  Goldsmith's guitar and Tay Strathairn's keyboards have a new found authority compared to their second album.  And the same can be said for Wylie Gelber's bass-which underpins and propels these songs, and Griffin Goldsmith's drumming has a refinement but still maintains that sound from their earlier albums.  Clearly, they don't want to be known for that \\"Jackson Browne/L.A./slightly worn\\" sound.<br /><br />The lyrics too have a refined edge to them, even more depth to them.  The melodies are a bit more subtle than on previous albums.  Songs like \\"Just Beneath The Surface\\", \\"From A Window Seat\\", \\"Just My Luck\\", \\"Someone Will\\", \\"Something In Common\\", \\"Stories Don't End\\", and \\"Side Effects\\" are all good examples of the band's maturing style.  Combine fine songwriting and the instrumental sharpening of the band, and they've never sounded better.  Listen to album closer \\"Just Beneath The Surface (Reprise)\\", for one of the band's most subtlety beautiful arrangements.  But it's the lyrics that have shown the most growth.  Goldsmith has taken a deeper look at life since the last album, and has come away with some fine, introspective moments that add depth to the band's maturing instrumental sound.<br /><br />This is an album well worth hearing if you're a DAWES fan.  If for some reason you're not, check out the band's other albums and then come to this.  Then you'll understand.)\\", for one of the band's most subtlety beautiful arrangements.

B0032CVAQQ|3.0|I think the book is nice for pop-culture, but clearly this is an extreme over-simplification of what is going on between couples.  If you have no other choice, following the advice in this book is better than nothing, but again, things are just not this simple.
B00A6CT012|5.0|This book is practical, beautifully written and deeply felt. There are wonderful tips, but I especially enjoyed the text's humanity. Bea is uncompromising and she does not flinch from exposing herself (although i follow her blog religiously, I did not know she used to own a SUV, had botox, 'upgraded' her wedding rings, etc.). Rather than 'judging' her, I feel relieved--because it permits me to accept my foibles and culpability instead of disavowing and repressing my waste-generation. I feel optimistic by the sight (and site) of this book. Totally galvanizing and useful. Love its connection to politics, family and everyday life; love that I don't feel alone or crazy in desiring idealistic transformation away from commodification, privatization, consumerism, etc. The tone is not didactic but stern and loving simultaneously. A more intimate companion to her stupendously fabulous blog. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Now, when is the cookbook coming out?
B004FOA84A|3.0|This one got off to a good start.  Nice roaming around, putting things in places.  Fun story, challenging, then it was done.  Poof.

Definitely watch it you will be waiting for the next show. The costumes and scenery are awesome as well. Acting is top notch. Only wish it was R Rated for more nudity but this is after all the History Channel, fight scenes are good and Ragnars wife is a hottie

Hot naked women, great fight scenes big budget makes this look like a Hollywood movie every episode. I am super hooked and desperately trying to find a way to watch season 3 since it is not on Amazon right now

B004JRVQX0|1.0|This piece of junk is PURPOSEFULLY designed to fail in order that PACE can sell you insurance*. If you are a professional such as I, you must own at least two iLoks for when one almost inevitably fails. Furthermore, you must take out their $30 per year insurance so you can keep working when the iLok dies. You will also have to pay a fee of $100 if you have not taken out insurance and want your replacement licenses dealt with in one week instead of three. PACE call this an \\"expediency\\" fee. I call it criminal extortion.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour, strongly research other alternative plugins or software that doesn't use this copy protection.

I don't always like every track on every album. But this one just didn't make the grade. Neither of these great talents were enhanced by this collaboration. You'd be better off buying any of their individual records.

His later work including this one with War was great as well. I was looking forward to rediscovering him with this album. I was not disappointed, but also not thrilled. There are some solid good songs but also some losers. Buy it if you were a fan, but if you weren't it may not appeal to you.
B0000062Y2|5.0|I saw both the play and the movie of Jesus Christ Superstar. I also have the record album and cassette of Jesus Christ Superstar: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Album and from the Broadway Play. Since cars no longer have cassette players in them but CD players, I had to purchase Jesus Christ Superstar: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Album  on CD so I could play it in the car. Jesus Christ Superstar is a very inspirational movie.

But even some of the more obscure covers are excellent. This may inspire younger music fans to check out the originals, and if that happens Chris will feel he has achieved his  mission. I also really enjoyed his liner notes about growing up with this music.

Bottom line--looks good but needs polishing.

B006LA6IW2|5.0|American Sniper by Chris Kyle is a moving/exciting story on how the war is won by our Navy Seals and other forces in that area.  It also shows how the interference of the politicians can and does cause extreme problems for our heros.  Witnesses for a sniper kill, Really! Killing an insurgant and then questioning whether it was a good kill or not is compleetely insane.  As are the payments to those suffering collateral damage from a fire fight.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Very hard to put down once you start reading it. I live near Dallas TX and the details really put you there.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Outstanding presentation of a real event.  Ends happily for all key characters.  Great acting with an excellent cast well scripted.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Awesome movie, but had some issues with picture quality @ times and movie stopping sometimes. I could watch it again and again though just because it is such a good story
B00005JKG5|5.0|A girl who's trying to survive by working in A steel mill,and A dancer in A night club.But also trying very hard to get out from where she's at and do better.By learning new dance steps so she can get into A dance troop.The film was great the soundtrack great it made the movie.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|not great not bad. I recommend if you are bored and have nothing better to do. The actors are what killed this possibly being higher.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I'm shocked to see an update on the kindle fire!  When it comes to the Kindle Fire, Evernote is the clear winner over Springpad.  With evernote, you can add photos but not w/ springpad.<br /><br />So far with the new update Evernote has less freeze up issues.<br /><br />You can use evernote for recipes, journaling, file backup, etc.<br /><br />The main draw of Evernote for me is the ease and reliability of sharing notes with others.<br /><br />This is one of the rare programs where it is worth paying the monthly fee for the premium option.<br /><br />Cons --<br /><br />Can't delete notebooks from kindle fire.<br />Needs minor improvements for easier stack creation.<br /><br />Bottom line, I've tried other note apps and I always come back to this one.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie, Daniel Day-Lewis did an amazing job portraying Lincoln. I would highly recommend watching this movie.
B009IUH1N2|2.0|If you run out of respawns it asks you if you want to purchase more.<br /><br />Very simple uncreative plot.<br /><br />Repetitive music.<br /><br />Doesn't respond to all your swipes.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is absolutely the best game ever..it passes the boredom on all  just wish there was ways to get gold besides actually buying it.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|better than the first! a lot of tweaks to get used too! very challenging! loving it! highly recommend!<br />get it now
B002SSUQFG|3.0|It's nice, but the face and band are way too small for a large man's watch.  I recommend this watch for kids, petite women, or small-wristed men.
B007MS5B6Q|4.0|The season itslef was awesome...it was my favorite out of the 3 so far and the picture and video is awesome!!<br /><br />The head itslef is really cool too, i just wish it was bigger. It would have been awesome if it was more life size but its still awesome.<br /><br />My wife bought this off of Amazon for like $65 for me back in Novembeer 2012 and im glas she did....ITS GOING FOR $350.00!!!  You're kidding me.
B007EECSFA|5.0|What a read!  I like to think that I can wrap up the plot of most books pretty quick.  Not so with this one.  I had at least three endings in mind and Kate Morton came up with something I never expected.  I am reading the last of her novels right now. Each has that twist that you just can't anticipate.  I can't wait for another.  Keep them coming Kate!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I told myself I wasn't going to fall into the 50 Shades trend, but I did and now I'm addicted! This was an awesome book and I can't wait to read the next!!
B0063M22QO|1.0|Not worth it, try something else. Puzzles are way too small and seem to be to easy. I'll be looking for a different version to download.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow what an amazing book... I need to read the last book.. A lot of surprises ahead... Can't wait!!!!!!  Go
B00BU8QOII|4.0|It was an encouraging movie that offers a message of hope when faced with impossible situations. The fact that it was based on a real life story made it moving.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Exciting as always, hard to put it down & looking for another to start on. Highly recommended, includes all you want in a thriller.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|My daughter wanted this cd/dvd, only she couldn't find it at a good price.  Now, that she has it, she is thrilled.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|From the moment that Rick wakes up in season one, all the way through season three, The Walking Dead proves to be a full fledge assault on the senses. From the visuals to the sound effects, at times so horrifyingly disgusting you just can’t look away. What a treat. I used to think that Zombies were the suckiest of monsters, but I love The Walking Dead.
B00377V6J2|5.0|We absolutely loved it.  It was what we exactly expected.  I have been looking for this cd/dvd everywhere, only thing is that it could be quite expensive.  Thank you
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Although this show fits into the SciFi genre, it can be appreciated and enjoyed by all who watch it. Its a pity that fox screwed it up and only aired the first season. As you may have noticed, fox aired the episodes out of order, which was the primary reason for the hard time the show received from critics. If you really love the show, they put out a movie titled Serenity in 2005 with the original cast to do their best to tie up loose ends.
B008602KQI|5.0|Many book adaptations include a great deal of poetic license by the movie director. This movie is near a literal translation and what is not exactly the same is either an improvement or superfluous. The sense of lethal control exerted by the Capitol is clear as is the papmpered life of its citizens and the barren lives of those of District 12. If you enjoyed the book you will find the movie a visual treat.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|Had a previous i3, which had Intel core graphics 3000. However, this specific one has Intel core graphics 4000, which is very nice of home theater build.
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|Had seen Jurassic park when it was first released.  Seeing it again many years later still was very enjoyable.  My grandchildren especially liked it.
B005CRPB0U|5.0|Thanks for the best way to make a good story about the tales of beetle the bard it was retell the story about Harry potter
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love murder mysteries, and this one kept me turning the pages.  Definitely recommend this book to anyone who read Nancy Drew as a kid!
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|LinkedIn needs to step up their game.  It is such a hard app to use and I can NEVER find what I want on there.  Super frustrating.  Especially since I'm really into networking.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Good writing, but kind of disturbing.  Kept me reading, but not my favorite book.  I liked Gone Girl much better.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I always heard about this show but never wanted to watch it because I thought it would be a show about a damn housewife who is rich and doesn't do anything all day and at the end cheats on her husband. But this show is way better than I thought!!!! I would watch the rest of the seasons and continue to watch until it stops running on TV....
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|Riverside has finally taken the step to making a fully satisfying album as a whole. They have been consistantly putting out great material, but this one has all the right touches and nuances. Prog is there, alt rock is there, melody and musicianship... all there. Not a disappointment for progressive rockers or alternative rockers.
B009IUH1N2|4.0|I'll begin by saying that there is also a free ad-based version of this game. You might want to download that version to try before committing to the paid version.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by how fluidly this game plays.  Even I could easily learn the basic moves (jump, slide, dash and kick).  Usually I fumble with the controls of running games. With this game you control your man with \\"swipes\\" rather than with buttons. The tutorial was very good so I was immediately able to get into the game with minimal frustration.<br /><br />The object of the game is to collect four gem pieces that will enable your dying master to get well again.  There are various pitfalls along your way through 25 levels. Examples of some of the game's challenges include jumping to avoid slamming into walls, jumping over rapidly running bad guys, sliding or dashing over chasms and ducking underneath things.  You do all of this while simultaneously running forward.<br /><br />One game \\"feature\\" I am having a hard time understanding has to do with \\"Time Rewinds\\" mode vs. \\"Endless Run\\" mode.  When you run out of time rewinds, you must play in endless run mode until you \\"buy\\" more. The game asks if you \\"would like to check out the store to buy a few rewinds?\\"  However, the App does not allow me to visit the store and what's more, nowhere (that I can see) does the game say why time rewinds are beneficial. I had to knock off a star because of this ambiguity.  (In the \\"Latest Updates\\" details, it says \\"Removed the coming store.\\"  I guess this slipped through the cracks.)<br /><br />Overall the game plays well. The amazing fluidity is a big plus. The comic book theme is cool. The edgy background music with its ninja chants can be muted if you wish.  This App uses 39.69 MB of memory on my Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />P.S.  I noticed that if you drift to the \\"Options\\" page, in the lower right hand corner (next to the burning torch flame), it says \\"The stone is a lie.\\"  I don't know what this means.  I'm mentioning this in case someone else can figure it out.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/17/13:  See comment regarding my review by J. Ruhl.  He cleared up the mystery of \\"The stone is a lie.\\"means.  I'm mentioning this in case someone else can figure it out.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/17/13:  See comment regarding my review by J. Ruhl.  He cleared up the mystery of \\"The stone is a lie.\\"
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Liked this book. Made me think...&#34;What would I do if this was my child&#34;. Didn't like this end. Do not think parents should decide what happened in the end.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Just watched the first 2 episodes of Revenge Season 2.  Loved Season 1 and can't wait to see how the story continues to unfold in the 2nd.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I'm a trial player, and out of all the sucky games I've played, this is the best.  On I am definitely considering buying this game.
1435114949|4.0|This is the second time I have had to order this book.,  this is an excellent book and the company (Bookwizard 107) is excellent. There is no review to give about Sherlock Holmes....he has made his own reputation.  He is a classic.  The book is excellent and the hard bound leather copy is a plus to any Library.  What defines an individuals experience will be, at this point, the material the book is written on, condition of the book, and the above par packaging and excellent service you receive...and this company has gotten an A+ from me.<br /><br />To ensure you as a customer have a a good experience, PLEASE at all cost avoid Stork Group Media like the plague.  Not only did they not send me my book, they did not give me a refund,and I was forced to buy the book again.  Avoid them and have a good experience!.  Bookwizard 107 gave me excellent service.
1476734941|2.0|So I heard about this on E!News and thought why not, lets buy the book.  I'm not fat or \\"overweight\\" by any stretch of the imagination, but I am that person thats always looking to drop 5lbs or so.  The funny thing about this book is that I already do half of what they recommend, that is I generally skip lunch (and usually breakfast as well) and dont really eat anything but dinner, so really in life I \\"fast\\" pretty much 5 days a week (I'm better with eating on the weekends).  The thing about this book is while reading it you get inspired for all these amazing changes to take place but when you actually start doing the diet you realize that there's only one change that would be visible to the naked eye and thats weight loss and if you're not losing weight then you dont even see the one benefit of this diet. When I started this two weeks ago I immediately lost 2 lbs, then another 1.5lbs the following week (though I didnt really feel the loss in my pants size) and then one day just for the heck of it I weighed myself on a non fast day (and NOT after a meal or anything) and I weighed EXACTLY the same as when I started this crap three weeks ago.  So with that and exercise and still no weight loss? Whats the point. Anyway like i said i normally skip breakfast and lunch and am not usually hungry till dinner anyway but this crazy fast had me craving food before I even began the fast day.  Its like knowing you couldnt eat the food made you want it ten times more than you normally would! Also I go to the gym regularly (and again I rarely eat before dinner so I usually exercise on an empty stomach) but just knowing that when my workout was done I wouldnt be able to have a normal meal when I got home made me want to take a nap on the treadmill. Also i was confused why the diet implies that as long as you eat 500 cals you're ok, but when you start reading you see its kind of like the HCG diet and they dont want any of those cals to come from sugar or oil or anything thats not steamed vegetables. Anyway the book definitely makes a lot of claims that would be great if we can know for a fact they were true but the diet itself is hard to follow, especially when you realize its not a diet for a month to get ready for bikini season its FOR LIFE! So I have to starve two days a week, every week FOR LIFE!!! Yeah eff this, I'll pass!!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed The Racketeer. I kept me engaged throughout. Another Grisham success with lots of twists and turns. Bravo Mr. Grisham.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I did not see this series when it first started.  The story line is tight, the characters developed.  The transmission and sound quality are excellent.
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|Easy to read, with humor and great story telling! The characters are easy to relate to even though it is written from a very different cultural way of life.  Much to gather in the area of wisdom!
B0090X4HES|5.0|cd came to my house fast it was not damaged or anything like that usually when i order cds the case is cracked but  not this time thanks
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I enjoy the way it is written, chapters that focus on individuals in the story.  It seems complicated but it isn't complicated, I always know where I am in the story and the story is always moving forward.  I look forward to reading with a great deal of anticipation but it does not lend itself to obsessive reading. Great story, fun to read, and a wonderful escape from our own reality yet it has many nuances that give helpful information on how we may deal with situations that arise in our own life stories.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|product was great i loved the cd , the best part was i had forgot that i pre order it so when i got home it was a real suprise
B003O86FMW|5.0|I found the 2nd book spellbinding and started Book 3, Mockinjay immediately because I need to know what happens next!  The writing is so good, my imagination could actually visualize what was written.  I can't wait for the 2nd movie to see if they visualize it the same way!
B000FDECGA|4.0|the movie itself was really good, i dont pay much attention to packaging since thats not what i am paying for . I enjoyed it and would buy again from this merchant
B0018RWD1S|5.0|First, I love Amy Winehouse!  She was so talented and such a soulful singer.  This CD is a testament to that talent.  My Mom often asks who the singer is and mistakes Amy for Billie Holiday.  Amy brought the old school soul into the 21st century, adding her own modern twist.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|its a lot of fun but I wish the houses cost a little less. but it definately is a good game
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I loved it, my daughter love it....It is a great family movie. The whole family will enjoy it. They don't make movies like this anymore.
1400069742|4.0|Those Angry Days is a very focused look at the two years before Pearl Harbor, when America was debating whether it wanted to get involved in what was a foreign war. Author Lynne Olson frames the story around two larger than life figures representing opposite sides of the debate -- President Franklin Roosevelt and Charles Lindbergh, the pilot who was first to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1927.<br /><br />It's a detailed and entertaining look at a period that is often quickly summarized and glossed over. Olson examines politics, literature, movies, theater, and diplomacy to give us a real feel for what it must have been like to not be sure that going to war was the right step for America. In retrospect, it seems obvious that we had to get involved, how could there be any doubt? But at the time, it was not so clear for many, although as the news of Nazi atrocities became impossible to ignore and the British and French were unable to hold their own against the German army, American public opinion began to turn toward involvement.<br /><br />As is the case with so many good histories, I learned a lot and still managed to finish the book with more questions than answers. Every history book is only an excuse to read another history book. Some observations: 1. Why did the Republican Party nominate Wendell Willkie in 1940, a candidate who was up until the convention that year, a Democrat? 2. I didn't realize that conscription had begun in the fall of 1940, so when Pearl Harbor was attacked, we were not as unprepared as we might have been. 3. Roosevelt apparently told his Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau that he was convinced that Lindbergh was a Nazi.<br /><br />It would be great to find a similar book that talks about the years right after the war. Here's hoping that Lynne Olson is working on a book like that right now.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I enjoy this game a lot, but don't want to post on facebook with it and that seems to be the only way to obtain more &#34;lives&#34;.  I would like to go back through the tutorial to know what the gold bars are for, but can't find a way to do it.  Therefore, I'm not sure what the different things are for now that I'm familiar with the game.  But I do enjoy it enough to play it until I've lost the 7 lives and then wait until another time when they're all there again.
B00C7L4QB4|2.0|If you're looking for a true to the mark good versus evil, detective story, this is not it. The special effects are awesome, but the story line is completely implausible. The writer/director could have made this a better show if they followed lessons learned from the early seasons of Criminal Minds. After five minutes of watching Lawrence Fishborne's character boss around a supposed non-law enforcement \\"outside help\\" or the Will Graham character, I started thinking about who all I needed to get christmas cards for this year.. At least it was free on Amazon.com, I'm glad I didn't pay for this experience.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Bought 2 of these to use with my piano students.  We study various composer throughout the year and this was a movie worth having them see and appreciate.  The quality of the video was great!!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great drama series onto season 2, Amazon prime is worth every penny, canceling Netflix today. Also movie rental are cheaper than Apple and looking into getting a Kindle Fire.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is the best thing to ever come along for Zombie fans. Not only do you get Zombies, but you also get insane maniacs to boot. There's not a lot of good horror TV shows but this one is the cream of the crop.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I still like the bk even though the style is different. I miss the writing style of the infernal devices n just can't help comparing this couple to Will n Tessa.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The shiel season one was great. I can't wait for season two? The series is full of excitement. Funny to watch
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I guess I'm just a big kid at heart.  I love Disney and I love to watch movies with my kids and there have only been a few that I have gone, &#34;my GOD when will it end.&#34;  This was not one of them.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a great story right to the very end-well written-great characters and really interesting book. I would highly recommend it
B0068FYZIO|5.0|It is a story everyone must see at least once in their lives.  It goes to the heart of what one person can and would do to help their fellow kind.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book kept me reading for hours and never wanting to put it down, It will bring tears to your eyes.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|This is a great app. It works fine on my Galaxy S3, and the ads don't bother me. But where is the Bespin update?! My husband bought this app through Google Play and got the update weeks ago. It would be nice if Amazon kept up.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I think that the people who make it and put islands better and put the score booster in the price range of 100_300 please this review really counts on you guys to change it to the island like Jamaica please jamacia
B005ZMUWWY|4.0|Love this movie for all of my kids (2 year old twins and a 6 year old)  The whole family finds something to keep them amused in it.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|They are very neat joke.<br />That book is  funny.<br />I like the jokes.<br />They are cool because people like jokes books
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I'm surprised they got as far as they did as the story was so involved. Tolkien wrote an amazingly complex piece in both the &#34;Hobbit&#34; and the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34;. Here, we see MiddleEarth for the first time and while the movie did take some &#34;poetic license&#34; from the written story, it remained true to the heart of the work. Here, we find the Dwarves as strong characters, not as mere silly shrunken people in a simple fairy tale and Thorin Oakenshield is a character one could aspire to emulate, even with his stubborn faults. While we have yet to see the Dragon, the backstory of Erebor showed that he will be a force to be reckoned with in the next film. The riddle scene between Bilbo and Gollum was classic showing Gollum as the dangerous creature he truly was. While the Goblins were a bit cartoonish in some ways, I tended to view them as a slightly different species similar and allied to Orcs, granting them the lisence Jackson was seeking. I hope the other movies come out soon. I too want to &#34;stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks to see the last light of the setting sun of Durin's Day shine upon the keyhole&#34; . For when they get that door open, I want to see what happens next. When this comes out in extended edition,I'll be in line to get a copy to see what I missed.
B003VANOFY|5.0|the greatest headset ever, no where in my house where it gets cut out and the voice morphing is funny as
B000VDUWMC|5.0|Its a thought provoking book that challenges every aspect of human evolution and tries to reason it's way to the most accurate answers.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|This is a fun movie with a great cast.  Diane Keaton always makes me laugh.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would watch it again.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|Excellent game! Well thought out and designed. Have already spent too much time that would have been better spent studying for exams.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob is a high interest novel that brings up several issues.  I was highly interested in the novel's attempt to evaluate the measure of &#34;nature&#34; vs. &#34;nurture&#34; theory.  Another area that I found fascinating was the legal system's decisions which often are more matters of Law than Justice.<br /><br />Landay deals extremely well with language and spends a great deal of effort in showing the differences in his characters.<br /><br />A question that remains unanswered is the extent of revelation that is needed in relationships.  Must one totally disclose all things? or is it possible to be honest while keeping some facts undisclosed?<br /><br />My one negative comment would be that there are too many twists in the plot but perhaps that is precisely what keeps readers eager to read on.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this book.
B00BAB6CNC|1.0|Like most hard rock, it depends on your taste as to whether or not you will like an album. I like to set a baseline by listing some contemporary bands that are closest to what I like and what this album is like.<br />What I like...<br />Heavy side: Five Finger Death Punch, Trivium<br />Soft side: Black Stone Cherry, Pop Evil, Aranda<br />What I hate...<br />Metro-Rock: Evans Blue, 10 Years, Incubus, Falling in Reverse, Escape the Fate - any band that jams, then when the lyrics start, power cords end and the singer decides to wine like a little b!tch<br />Too-Hard: Anything where you can't understand any of the lyrics<br /><br />The review, as I listened to it for the first time...<br />The first track, Red, sucks (slow song), but Black John is not too bad at track two.  I hope the CD keeps up with hard tracks like this; as a Slipknot fan, this is what we want to hear.  Track three, Sadist, starts slow, and leads into Corey Taylor's ever-increasing slow whiny, Metro-rock vocals.  I made myself listen until the hook and chorus, and guess what - it gets worse.  It sounds like Pink Floyd's last album, not Division Bell, but the one that no one remembers because it was so bad.  Take that album and mix it with a sack of turds, then crossed with your favorite 10 Years/Evans Blue/Escape the Fate band.<br /><br />The second quarter of the album starts out with the same slow, mellow crap that p!sses me off with Peckinpah.  30 seconds in, he starts whisper-singing.  At 1:00 it starts to rage, you start to get into it, then Ms. Taylor goes back into a lighter, whimpier version of Tool.  Track five, Stalemate, really pulls a big psyche - you hear a big breathe in, as if he's gonna finally rage - nope.  The song actually isn't that bad, just not what I wanted.  It's a nice solid rock and roll song with an occasional scream and a chorus song like Aranda.  Don't get me wrong, I love Aranda, but that type of local melody has no place in a Stone Sour album.  The first half is finished off by Gravesend.  It starts with a sound that is fitting for an awful album - an alarm clock sound.  It starts with some raging power cords, but by this time, we all know Corey is ready to put that to a stop and whine or whisper.  Surprise, he whisper sings the first minute.  Just like Peckinpah, he starts to rage a minute in, but at this point, this Ranger is sick of these antics, and I'm not going to let myself get let down by his bipolar MetroRock lifestyle.<br /><br />The second half starts with '82.  A year the Bengals played the 49ers, and some would say - oh yea, great year, \\"The Catch\\".  Just like Stone Sour, \\"Oh yea, Slipknot, right?\\".  No on both accounts.  By 1982, the Catch was a year behind us.  Sadly, I think Stone Sour/Slipknot is a year behind as well.  If Stone Sour roles out their new tracks at ROTR 2013, this Ranger will be leaving.  '82 sucks.  Track eight, The Uncanny Valley, starts out slow, again.  By this point in the album, you only keep listening to be amazed that the CD can't get any worse.  This is amazing.  This is starting to sound like one of the worst CDs I've ever purchased.  This song sound just about like every other song on the CD - slow, 1990's-light and just plain crappy.  Track nine, Blue Smoke, starts with some hard bass sound effect thuds.  Some wind blows in the distance.  I'm hoping for a ranging set of power cords, but I know it's going to go slow and whimpy.  Yep, a couple piano chords and bass chime in slowly. Corey, singing through Scott Weiland's used megaphone is yet again try to show his vocal range.  Hey Corey - guess what - you're not Aaron Lewis.  Not even in the same neighborhood, let alone sitting at the same dinner table.  Scream and do what you're good at.  Maybe call Jim Durbin to see if he can give your cigarette-ridden voice a lift.  This song is total crap, and I'm tired of suffering through your attempt at singing.  Blue Smoke fades directly into track 10, Do Me a Favor.  This track is actually prettygood. He rages and sings the way we want.  Finally, after nine crap songs (and one OK at track two), we have a descent song.  Hey, at least Stone Sour didn't get shut out completely.  Track eleven brings us The Conflagration.  Yawn, pianos and Corey trying to win an American Idol contest.  Yo, dog, you have no range, you're a little sharp and your tone is all over the place.  The last song, the title track, is pretty good too - it starts hard, slammin like we'd expect, rolls into some kick-arse drums, some rad power cords, then kicks in legit vocals a minute in.  Good finish to an otherwise horrendous album.<br /><br />I really can't say I've heard a worse album in the last year.  Sadly, Part 1 is probably right there with it (sans The Amity Affliction).
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Just a great App to have.You can set multiple alarms for different times.All this and more on your Kindle.Even works in sleep mode.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|As always, Kathy Reichs delivers!  Wish she could write as fast as I devour her work.  Thanks for yet another great read!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Held my attention throughout.  Very well done.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys twists and turns and a well written book!!!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I could not put this book down - an excellent read. It has a surprise ending you won't see coming
0547564651|5.0|Simple and easy to read with a series of great stories to illustrate the main ideas. I really enjoy reading it and have reread it several times.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love it a fun game to play! Enjoy playing on my kindle fire at home and away.Glad I purchased it.
B0040I09RM|5.0|i'm still watching the series but catches you and then you have to see what happens the show is just good
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Terrific read, well-paced with compelling characters and a satisfying ending.  Fans of  \\"The Help\\" and \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" will devour this book.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|DVDs were new still in original wrapper. Got in a few days, to longer to receive than it took me to watch.<br />I would purchase something else .
B004J4WN0I|5.0|The similarities are there but they don't overwhelm or ruin the book.  As a huge Dresden Files fan I saw this as a great Irish twist and refreshing character set.  Different magic, different deities and monsters; same quick and blunt action
B001UTW7QU|5.0|A great show of mystery and science... best way I can describe it is ALIAS and X-Files meets and now you have Fringe! Love it!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I love this group  of actors and the whole premise of this story.  Nathan Fillion as Captain Malcolm Reynolds is my favorite<br />character.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book is for someone who likes twisted, preposterous plots and who doesn't mind graphic language.  I read it because I had friends who loved it, but it was not for me.
B004CR5TD0|3.0|It was good though I was expecting something more like his reasent work. Unquestionably, he has improved... I like more what he's done more reacently...
B005UZ1IJC|5.0|I love this remastered albumn, sounds great! One of my all time favorite groupts.I am enjoying this very much. Great!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|After watching ssn 1&2 I did'nt think it could get any better. I WAS WRONG!<br />As I sat with my wife, laughing one minute & crying the next, I was amazed at the talent there. The actors, the writing, the cinematography. Excellent!<br />Can't wait for season 4.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game, trying to get all my friends to play it too , so addicting in my opinion!
B005LAII8A|5.0|This was a great movie.  There was a lot of action and the storyline was captivating.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies like Back To The Future and Terminator.<br /><br />The movie was so good that I'm going to purchase the DVD after watching it on Netflix.
B008602KQI|5.0|It is really a great watch. Has me waiting for the next one of this series. Great for the whole family..
B009CF7GRY|2.0|I was forced to watch this movie and couldn't help nut wonder, why...  Why did they need to make this movie.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|Fast moving but reels the reader in with the continuing story line, The changing character list is great.  can't wait for the next book.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|I loved it. It was a great love story and very clean with words. I would reccomend it for anyone wanting a really good, clean story.
B00594XOZU|2.0|I can never find someone when I put It in Shia search box and no help is required at all
B000FA675C|5.0|Actually i have read this book before but it was in Chinese version. The English version is pretty different though, it is much shorter.<br />But i is better than Chinese version.
B00B9366VO|4.0|We are glad to have seen it. Great music and interesting story. We bought the album and are enjoying that too.
B00BF11STU|4.0|The movie was well done, with excellent acting.  The underlying storyline seems to be authentic, and provided a basis for questioning the media accounts of the event.
B00B49L7Y4|4.0|We enjoyed this documentary about Sixto Rodriguez, a Bob-Dylan-esque musician from the sixties. Rodriguez is a completely non-materialist man with a great singing voice and song writing skills. Definitely worth watching.
B005FI6IRG|5.0|I've been playing this on a continuous loop all evening. It's absolutely sublime. My favourite tracks are by Bononcini and Francesco Conti.  It is a faultless recording. the combination of instruments, and the two vocalists complement each other superbly. Everyone in my family has had to listen to it for hours, and my young son keeps popping his head around the door every so often to ask what a particular piece is and to tell me how much he likes it. Give yourself a treat, and buy a copy of this CD - I can't recommend it strongly enough.
B004N0I3U2|4.0|Bronson's first as 007 - OK but not &#34;real Bond&#34;.  Good action, hot chicks, classic Bond music.  Fun flick to enjoy
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|My kids (11, 9, and 5) love this show. The animation is fun, as are the characters. There are no off-color jokes (passing gas, or talking about people's butts). It has a great message that kids can make a difference.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Always an unexpected twist in his books! A wonderful book to read. Highly recommended if you love the unexpected. Wonderful
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis does a great job. Not sure how Historically accurate the movie was, but it was very entertaining and interesting.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This is one series that keeps you reading! It is a page turner to say the least. The characters are well formulated and it is easy to get lost in their lives.
B00BESNKB8|1.0|Pretty bad cheesy kung fu movie. Quentin Tarantino presents The Man with the Iron Fists, an epic action-adventure inspired by classic kung fu movies... not so much
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|After the thrilling start, it goes a little slow. But overall a great watch. Denzel delivers a great performance that keeps you engaged.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This was a very moving novel.  The author spoke from a child's prospective and it truly touched your soul. It was a thriller as well.<br />The reader never knew if the main character would survive or be yet another victim in this holocaust novel.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I was excited to be able to see the movie but was disappointed that it wasn't as good as the play.  I own the broadway soundtrack which I love and the music really fell short in the movie
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved the family relationships, the servants relationships, and the relationships between upstairs and downstairs. And the history of the times.
B00ABMZRVO|3.0|This story would have worked with a man and a woman just as well.  It reminded me of &#34;When a Man Loves a Woman&#34; with them dealing with alcohol rather than these guys and Meth.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|progress is painfully slow if you don't pay to play. many features and items In the game are not accessible unless you pay for them. experience credit when leveling up is not proportional to the degree of difficulty and time taken on that level (slow progress). free money by signing up for tapjoy offers has been removed in the latest update. other than that the game is quite fun and addicting. the only reason I still play it is my addiction too get to the end.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|I enjoyed all of it. No interruption of film. I didn't watch this when it first was on TV. This gives me the chance to get caught up..
B008B8DY2O|5.0|I really enjoyed this story, it was a fascinating look at Indian life and it's underworld from a Westerner's perspective.  A truly enjoyable read.
B000FA675C|5.0|Great product and I could not beat the price -  Hope to see more examples of ebooks hitting the net to allow for libraries to grow!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Great game, very exciting! Would recommend to all who like shark games, can't wait for the next game to come out
B009IUH1N2|1.0|I do not recommend this game at all. It is like a sideways temple run. only worse. I gave the game maybe two levels and was so bored by it I immediately uninstalled the app. I don't understand why they would charge 1$ for an absolutely terrible app when there are other apps out there that are way better than it, and FREE. the creator had to think very little to create this, don't waste your time.
B008LH4YYC|5.0|This is the  best app ever!  Since there is no direct way to close apps on the kindle fire hd install this program and when you feel your Kindle is getting sluggish.  It will kill (stop) all  of the unnecessary programs / apps and your Kindle Fire hd will run super fast again. It is straightforward &amp; easy  to use and FREE!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I REALLY ENJOY PLAYING THIS APP. WORKS GREAT ON THE KF PLUS GREAT WAY TO SPEND YOUR FREE TIME. ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT LEVELS TO CHOOSE FROM.WOULD RECOMMENED THIS GAME TO ANYONE. HAVE FUN IF YOU DOWNLOAD THIS ONE!
B004SDSSFY|5.0|This suite will open all your files: MS Word, Excel &amp; PowerPoint including password protected documents (as long as u know the password).  I purchased once on Amazon and have it on my droid, two Toshiba Thrives, Kindle Fire &amp; Kindle Fire HD.  I also have Apple products but had to purchase again through them for our 4 itouch iPods 4th generation and our iPad 3.  Across all of these devices with the full version I can open, edit, or create documents. Never had any issues. Perfect program on the go. I highly recommend it.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Thumping good rainy spring day read! Grisham seems to never run out of intriguing ideas for his &#34;page turner&#34; novels.
B008QTV3X0|1.0|Don't like this kind of drama, so this is not a show for me. I like the male lead though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game is so addicting and I cant get enough of it. if I could I would play this all day. sadly my moms kindle badery dies an I have to wait
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|I love this movie!  We recently had a similar situation occur in our lives and we went back to re-watch this movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app.  I use it all the time aspetialy when I bring it on long trips so I can minuter the batery life.
B008DM4OTA|2.0|My granddaughter wanted to play that game.  I purchased it and we couldn't get into to for her to play it.  After a few minutes she opted to play another game we had on my Kindle.  I'll try again when she's not here and see what's up.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|So, so.  Typical Aptow directed comedy: seemingly without a script.  Does finish better than expected, yet still felt cheated. Aren't there any good comedies left?
B003D0E3FM|5.0|For a 1956 film the primitive special effects still hold up today if you understand and accept it's an old movie. The plot of the film is timeless too, struggles with the inner self. Magnified by an alien power, what awful things could develop?
B007V508CC|5.0|This cd is awesome to listen to with the radio loud and the windows down.  I really like it alot!!
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I did not recive this to my kindle so can not play it thanks. would like to have it sent
B0014VPFTA|5.0|John Mayer is such a great musician. This cd has the best of his music in my opinion.  LOVE IT!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Love all of this series of books.  Reacher is assume!  Anyone who's read and likes Lee Child would like this.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|Awesome dvd!! I love John Mayer. He is an awesome guitarist! My boyfriend reccommended it to me and we watched it together.
B00A85EMVK|3.0|I was very happy when I first read this was coming out in 3d and when I got it home I was so disappoined  by what I saw the video was not very clear and looked very old not very good in HD wish I had went to see it in the theater so I would not have wasted my money
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|We've been introducing our 9 year old daughter to our favorite classics. Man, this movie really stood the test of time. Just as awesome as when I first saw it!<br /><br />We loved it and so did our daughter!
B005HP2JAM|1.0|I did not like this video as there was very little of the cave in it I wish I had my money back
B006LSZECO|3.0|It kept me reading but left me not totally satisfied.  I could not identify nor sympathize with the characters, nor  was their lives developed enough to understand
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Hubby enjoyed it... I fell asleep....it was just boring. Have seen plenty of other movies of similar content that were much more interesting. My recommendation is... If you have to see it, rent it before buying. It may or may not be more appealing to you.
B004UPANGM|5.0|If you have already seen Evil Dead 2, I am happy to report that the quality for the picture and video through Prime is great.  This definitely beats out my OLD VHS and actually looks better than the old DVD versions.<br /><br />For those not familiar and looking to jump into this movie after seeing the new Evil Dead remake...be warned.  The tone of this film is nothing like that one.  This definitely falls under the horror comedy category thanks tot he camp and mugging of Bruce Campbell alone.
B008220D7S|4.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely. Marriage is not easy and you have to be able to laugh at the insanity of sharing your life with someone. My husband and i both laughed. A lot. Maybe because we are similar to the main chatacters. It was a little long but otherwise hilarious.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|When you pay for a streaming movie and you fall asleep 30 minutes into it it stinks.Such a waste of good actors Spielberg bombed with 1941 also.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a decent collection of mini-games, ranging in style from snake to dodge-'em to target shooting and more. But you only have access to a few of the games at first. Playing those games and beating certain target scores earns you points to unlock more. Unfortunately, the cost to unlock games gradually increases so that after unlocking about 20 games, it gets very difficult to get enough points to unlock more.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|I have the whole series of the Camel Club.  I like the way one book flows to the next.  They are a good mystery read.  Seems highly possible that even though it's fiction it could be real.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|After hearing The<br />Blue Sky Riders in concert I had a year wait for the release of this album. it was so worth the wait. Since obtaining my copy, i purchased 5 more as gifts. The harmonies are rich,the music is stick in your head great and lyrics are story telling and clever. Oh and the vocals...marvelous.This cd is a super blend of contemporary,rock and country.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|It doesn't give time to get the last number.  the numbers are small so sometime you hit the bingo button by mistake then you lose the whole card.
B000NMW6M0|3.0|Too confusing, convoluted and improbable.  Also, boring.  I would not recommend this film, especially being advertised ad Brad Pitts' Best Film Performance
B00BF11STU|5.0|Very well done; it certainly held my attention throughout the whole thing.  I would certainly recommend this movie to everyone - it deserved all the nominations that it got.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I absolutely love love love love love love this movie. I love Brad Pitt's accent.! Hilarious!!! Great Movie! Quentin Tarantino rocks!!!
B00BRR66SA|5.0|JT has done it again!!! Most of the time you would have to listen to a few tracks before purchasing albums. But JT is one of those artists that as soon as you know the release date, you are buying it without even hearing one of the tracks!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed this book SO MUCH and am looking forward to Gillian Flynn's other novels and the movie versions of all her books! As cliche as it sounds, I couldn't put Gone Girl down, and I would look forward to the end of the work day when I could kick back in my recliner and read for a few hours. I didn't love the ending, but that's my only beef with it. I'm an English teacher and always feel compelled to read something more academic - like a classic I never read or something - but this time around, I told myself I just wanted a good story. Boy, did I choose well!
B003XRELGQ|4.0|Not quite as good as slaughterhouse but still satirical and poignant.  A quick read that even bokonon himself would enjoy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't get enough of the Crawleys! I love them and their silly, dramatic lives, and I'm so depressed that I'm fully caught up with the show ...
B008Q09K2U|2.0|He has a problem to finish his books lately, to predictable. The built up of the plot is very detailed, but the finish feels as he is running out of time/pages.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest.  I am on Pinterest everyday sorting my ideas and my interest.  I can group them by subject.  My boards are getting larger with pins that help me organize my everyday tasks.  I host events seasonally and they are huge success because of pins shared by others and pinned by me.  I am hooked forever.
0307269965|4.0|Love the book, love this edition, don't really love the glue they use to tape on horrible 'movie tie-in' dust jackets. But, alas, finding a used hardcover of Brideshead is not as easy as one might think.
1439156816|5.0|Honestly, I was not expecting much from this book. I had assumed it would be another drab &#34;how to&#34; from a successful writer. Wow, was I wrong!! Instead, it was not only a terrific insight into the writing process, but also a wonderful look into the life of a great writer. King may not be held up with the greats of literature. However, no one can argue that he isn't doing something right. &#34;Popular&#34; doesn't mean bad. Instead, it means that he has managed to strike a chord with millions of satisfied readers.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|What can I say? I'm a fan of the Stargate SGC and Atlantis series. I was really sorry to see it end.
B004A8ZX28|4.0|I would call this movie worth watching (again&again), lots of suspense and mystery, Neeson does his usual good job of being immersed in his &#34;role&#34; with very good supporting actors/actresses to fill out the story.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Cute movie! Entertaining and fun. Nothing objectionable! My 14 year old enjoyed it. It wasn't 'too young' for him. Loved the references to the retro games!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|this is the second book i read about north korea (after Escape from Camp 14).  the author does a great job of telling multiple stories throughout her book, each one of which is a gripping account of how people have to live their lives under such an oppressive regime.  this book also helps to illustrate the differences in the two extremes of life possible in the North; the life of privilege as a member of the elite class and the life of horror in the peasant class.<br /><br />this was a real page turner for me...i started it one saturday morning and was done by dinner time.  i would count this as one of the main texts people need to read if they are even remotely interested in the fascinating and deplorable situation that is happening RIGHT NOW on our planet.<br /><br />god bless and help those people who are faced with trials and tribulations the average american cannot even fathom.
0307592731|5.0|This book made me want to wander the wilderness and be brave and find myself the same way this authur did.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This is an excellent show as the characters are very appealing and the story line is original, intelligent and entertaining.  But glad that Nick is out of the picture (hopefully).
0143035711|5.0|A Gulfstream IV pilot told me about the book. He simply said it is a must read. He was right. This book will give you a whole new appreciation of what these brave men and women went through. Robert Mason is not only an amazing huey slick pilot but an amazing author.
B003TNW044|5.0|What's not to love?  This is a great show and my kids are enjoying it too - they were born when this show was on the air!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am hooked.  I have gotten great craft and recipe ideas and can lose myself for hours just looking at the funny stuff.  You may want to put a time limit on usage though because I bet lots of people are losing chunks of their life to this app :)  LOL
B009FZHYKU|4.0|While it's not the most exciting season, it is full of the interpersonal conflicts a lot of people desire. I prefer a bit wider approach as to how things are going with humanity but perhaps that will come in later seasons.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|Keep It Simple. Dr. McDougall's book is a logical, science-based exploration into the fundamentals of nutrition. It reminded me that eating, as a  natural activity, should be as straightforward as breathing air and drinking water. We don't need pollutants in either our air or water and we don't need a diet that pollutes our bodies.<br />The starch-based diet that he recommends provides optimum nutrition and clean fuel to keep us in optimum health.<br />If you want to enjoy eating full, satisfying, easy to prepare meals that are not full of unneeded calories and health harming ingredients, this book is a must read.<br />If you are desirous of changing to a health supporting way of eating, you may find that your biggest challenge is to overcome the way you have been socialized about food. Your nemesis will be the insidious nature of the conditioning of your thoughts and emotions resulting from a life-long exposure to advertising from the meat and dairy industries.<br />The Starch Solution is a practical method for switching to a diet that promotes health and helps you understand the benefits of terminating continuation of a &#34;normal&#34; American diet that promotes disease.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Could not put it down!! cant wait for the nex one in the series!!! Fast paced and never borring, great read!
B00A83075M|4.0|I absolutely loved the premise of this movie. Seeing the previews, I couldn't wait to see it.<br /><br />Plot- Wreck-it Ralph is tired of always being the bad guy and wants to try to win a medal and show he can do good things.<br /><br />Characters- There are nods to some of the more retro games. Q-bert, tapper, pac man, and a few other classics made appearances.<br /><br />Animations- Simply incredible, what you would expect from a Disney caliber film. From such details as having a slight delay in the \\"Fix it Felix, JR.\\" characters to the HDness of newer games. It is obvious a lot of thought was put into this aspect of the film.<br /><br />Here are my complaints:<br /><br />1. It had a good start and a strong ending, but the middle seemed lacking. After thinking about it, perhaps they spent too much time on the build up in Sugar Rush. I almost feel asleep! They could have added in visiting a few more video games, perhaps some more of the old school ones. Either that or cut some material and make it a shorter film.<br /><br />2. There was quite a bit of violence in it. For me this is fine, but I wonder how much you want to expose younger children to. Case in point, in hero duty the main premise of the game is to blast alien bugs. Another example is when the heroine from Hero Duty slaps Fix it Felix, jr. repeatedly to attract the laughy taffy. Talk about encouraging slapping!<br /><br />In the end it was a good film for an older game nerd such as myself, but I question bringing younger Disney-esque audiences to see it. I didn't expect this to be another Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast, but it still surprised me with some of its not exactly appropriate for children content.
0240810554|4.0|Didn't know this book  was all about  chemical (photo) weapons . But still I like it  .Maybe in a later stadium of my darkroomexperience I'm glad to have bought it !
0307949486|3.0|It took me a very long time to get into this book.  It seemed the first third of the book was long-winded and it couldn't keep my attention for more than a few minutes at a time.  It took so long for Mikael and Lisbeth to actually connect in the story I began to wonder if it was two separate stories I was reading.  When they did connect, I found the chemistry very lacking, despite the fact that Lisbeth (for me) isn't a likable character.<br />The story picked up in the middle of the book, and then I found I couldn't put it down. But so much time was spent in leading up to the mystery of Harriet's disappearance, that when everything came out in the open and just suddenly covered up as though nothing had ever happened, it was a big let down for me.  The remainder of the book was a continuation of the beginning and didn't add anything...for me, it seemed to just further trivialize Harriet's story.<br />The literal English translation also interrupted the flow of the reading for me, it didn't flow smoothly, and some of the words and phrases used would not necessarily have been used the same way by an English-speaking person and so lost some of the meaning.
0821221841|4.0|this is super for knwing your own camera - how to use it  with tricks and tips - Very useable
B009XHAM8G|5.0|This book is a necessity on every child's bookshelf! I cherish the memories we have made with this book. Highly recommended!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This has got to be the best game to relax...yet make you think. I have fell asleep in bed playing this game....and that's a good thing! Well worth the money. The bigger the screen the better with the graphics too!!
B0093X805W|5.0|Roald Dahl is a great author for kids because he always makes the main character so extravagant and full of energy. I think his books are wonderful.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this series even tho I am far from YA in age--I'm 65-- the series is well plotted and written and not just for YA people
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|This movie was moronic! Bruce Willis has no chemistry with Jai Courtney; whose character is a whiny brat. There is no way this stupid kid is an operative of any kind.  The famous tag line for the Die Hard movies isn't even used although the opportunity is there for John McClane to say it. Yippee Cai Aye...don't waste your money! It's boring, monotonous and I kept looking at my watch to see what time it was, hoping that there would be some redeeming part in this movie to help justify the price of the ticket. Even the bad guys are boring. Now they want me to spend $27.99 to own it! Not gonna happen.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I saw Life of Pi on a plane. The movie was so good that i decided to see it again with my family on a larger screen. I wasn't disappointed and decided to read the book. The book is excellent.<br /><br />The story is appreciated on many levels. First, it's a great story about a boy and a tiger. On a higher level, it's about the mind's compensation for unthinkable atrocities, and finally, and the reason why it is such a good read, it asks us a question. What is faith?  Why do we believe?<br /><br />I recommend this book to any and all, without reservation.
B0058P4QY8|5.0|Reading Doyle's stories has been a journey into old English life and enjoyable at every turn of the page. You must read these if you are a fan of Guy Ritchie 's depiction of the characters in the recent Sherlock Holmes movies. Awesome!
B0049J3RBC|5.0|Excellent story, interesting characters, super animation.  The screenplay was lively, intriguing, and fresh.  The story was cute and unforgettable. Highly recommended.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|This movie is timeless. I was so impressed by the quality and how they have reinvented the animation, so to speak
B004JMY312|4.0|And for Disney: really good for a family show, meaning kids AND adults.  Some of the acting and situations are hilarious; they don't make them like this too often.  All three actresses are excellent, and the writing is crafted well, and the actresses do it justice.  I'm surprised that so much effort has gone into the writing and the direction of what is, on the face of it, a simple potboiler.  This is worth pulling out annually!
052118939X|5.0|Definitively... I highly recommend this book for self study or guided... best book in english grammar for intermediate students for sure
B0045HCJ8U|1.0|Mine came defective and returned, but what I could see was BAD, real BAD. Hard to believe this won so many Oscars, considering it was up against The African Queen - which is a FAR better movie.
B002S45V32|5.0|I love this movie because it remind me of the 80's when I was a young girl and wanted to be like them. I always wanted to design my own close. I love seeing this movie again and again it one of the movie you can't get try of seeing.
0525958002|3.0|Although I never considered myself a Duran Duran fan, I have to admit, I knew all of the songs Mr. Taylor referred to in his book.  I was touched by his father's story and what his dad lived through in World War II.  Mr. Taylor's candor regarding his rehab experience was engaging as well.  He is not alone in the British Pop Star addiction/rehab/recovery scene: Midge Ure, Jah Wobble and Tony Hadley spring to my mind.<br /><br />Mr. Taylor is kind to his bandmates.  For instance, I was unaware that the band worked together so well.  I enjoyed what he had to say about \\"Ordinary World\\", a song which means more to me as I get older.<br /><br />However, if you want to know details about Duran Duran's iconic videos and ancedotes about the terrible time it was BEING in Duran Duran at the apex of their success, I feel Andy Taylor's book gives more detail.<br /><br />After reading this, I grabbed my iPod and cranked up all the Duran Duran tunes I had.  And sang along to every song.
B002VL4OC6|5.0|The book was in a good condition as described in the description. It actually was in much better condition than I expected.
0307716554|2.0|Having found 'Sister' a fairly entertaining read, I was hoping for the same with 'Afterwards'. However, I am now three quarters of the way through this tedious novel and asking myself, \\"Shall I bother to finish this?\\" I shall probably soldier on as I am catching a flight this afternoon and will want to read something, but my instinct is to drop it into my charity donation box and forget about it.<br /><br />The characters are dull and one-dimensional. I have no trouble accepting the notion that spirits are overlooking and acting as sleuths in unraveling the novel's central mystery. But the device of addressing the husband in telling the tale does become annoying, and the character of the husband (not to mention many others) is poorly developed.<br /><br />It is over-long and could be edited down to half the length. It is also full of all sorts of smug middle-class commentary along the way - from the voice of Gracie, who is one of the most irritating characters I've ever come across. As other reviewers have mentioned, while I am happy to accept the notion of disembodied spirits, I am less convinced that they suffer from 'sore feet' whilst 'walking' outside on the gravel. What is that about?<br /><br />It is a tiresome and silly book that seems rushed and ill thought out. I actually don't care who started the wretched fire - nor do I care if either of the characters who were injured wind up dead! And, as I have read the bulk of the story, this doesn't reflect well on the novel's quality.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Great for kids, teens, and adults. I enjoyed it as much as the 9yr old sitting next to me!! Love
B00555X8OA|5.0|Possibly the most difficult thing about reading this book is admitting that you and your brain are as susceptible to the biases and shortcuts that Kahneman describes as any other man. It will forever change the way you think about thinking and you will be more aware of how you make your decisions and possibly less likely to be manipulated by others and by yourself. Could not recommend this book more.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|It left with such a cliff hanger that you undestood there needed to be a sequel. But Im not sure if it did well enough in the box-office to make a sequel which leaves the audience with a bit of a let down. I wouldnt watch again unless I knew there would be another one.
B00452VF4O|5.0|I will read anything Sharon Kay Penman writes.  She is a master of character development.  I easily get lost in her version of medieval history.
B00A5052YE|3.0|I thought the &#34;Girl on Fire&#34; featuring Niki Minaj was sadly put together - alicia is a wonderful singer with a lot of soul which shows immensely in &#34;Brand New Me&#34; and a cew other songs. Not her best album.
B004WR125O|4.0|I first tried connecting via the automatic route, and the connection failed.  I then tried connecting manually, which requires you to type in the long pass code, and it connected successfully.  It's been working great since then.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I will watch the rest of the series without hesitation. I understand I may be the very last person to see this show - but it is so funny and well acted!!!!!
B002ZBRSMK|1.0|Aspect ratio error and poor picture quality rendered this movie unwatchable.  So much, I turned it off after a few minutes.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Stay away from this movie at all costs. It is simply awful!!!! BEWARE - A waste of your time! Ewwwww
B004DK5CW4|4.0|Secretariat (Randall Wallace, 2010)<br /><br />I will tell you right now--because I have a suspicion that I'm going to end up focusing on a couple of things about Secretariat that really, really annoyed me--that I enjoyed this movie immensely. I recommend it to everyone, even people who don't like horse racing (especially, actually, people who don't like horse racing). But I recommend it with the caveat that once you're done watching it, I will equally strongly recommend you go read William Nack's Secretariat: The Making of a Champion, the book that \\"suggested\\" Mike Rich's script--because they're you're going to get all the stuff that this movie leaves out--notably, the second half of the horse's career, which was arguably more impressive than the first half depicted here.<br /><br />In case you're not up on your horse racing history, the plot: a horse is born. Outspoken owner Penny Chenery (Lady Beware's Diane Lane), who has recently taken over her dying father's racing and breeding business and is now trying to make headway into a traditionally male-dominated society (after all, they do call it the Sport of Kings, right?), realizes she's got something special, and after some wrangling, she assembles what ends up--in the movie, anyway--being the perfect team to turn that something special into a superstar: trainer Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich), groom Eddie Sweat (The Help's Nelsan Ellis), and jockey Ron Turcotte (actual jockey Otto Thorwarth in, to date, his only screen appearance). Penny fights the Boys' Club, the horse fights on the track, and we all get to the Triple Crown.<br /><br />Yes, it's a loose adaptation. I was mostly okay with that, though Hollywood once again takes the easy way out and leans on the Triple Crown as the Arbiter of All That Is Great in Horse Racing, rather than attempting to explain, for example, that Secrtariat's final career race, in the Canadian International at Woodbine, cemented his place in history just as much as his run in the Belmont did. (Because, you know, doing that would require making audience members who are less familiar with horse racing actually learn something, and we can't have that, now, can we?) Getting butts in seats for historical dramas usually requires at least a little tweaking, to play up the parts of the story that modern viewers will find more relevant--in this case, The Woman Fighting for Equal Rights in a Man's World(TM). And that's not necessarily a bad thing, though it does tend to cast an undeserved light on American racing's elite, who, while undeniably sexist (Americans, more than any other racing country in the world, believe that \\"the fillies can't run with the boys\\", which is why America cards so many more races restricted to fillies and mares per capita than any other country--though that it changing, and it's going the wrong way), have always been more interested in the color of one's money than the direction of one's plumbing, as it were. But I don't think most two-buck bettors are going to complain at any movie that takes a bunch of swipes at Bull Hancock, gruffly played by Fred Dalton Thompson, or Ogden Phipps (James Cromwell), or any of the other ultra-wealthy types. After all, they've never gone around picking up tickets off the grandstand floor looking for something they can cash.<br /><br />But it does bring up the question in my head--why do you feel the need to (over-)dramatize a story, Hollywood, that's already dramatic? It's impossible for any horse fan to listen to Chic Anderson's call of the Belmont and not tear up a little. And unlike, say, Seattle Slew, who went into the Triple Crown undefeated, Secretariat wasn't perfect. It wasn't a question of waiting for the inevitable loss (some horses do retire undefeated, natch, but they are few and far between), but even when it looked like he overwhelmed everything else, you knew there was always an Onion or a Prove Out who might suddenly pop up and remind you that this horse was mortal. Point being, you could simply tell the story and come up with a good movie. Maybe even a better one than this, though I say again, as I said at the beginning, I liked this one well enough. But there was room for improvement. *** ½, you could simply tell the story and come up with a good movie.

B009G78EE2|5.0|buy it - play it - love it -<br />I have it on replay in my phone. I cant wait to hear what comes next!!
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Frustrated with how slow Amazon MP3 has been on the Kindle Fire HD, the numerous crashes, the inaccurate time bar (when you change what part in the song is playing, it's inconsistent and clicking at the end could play the beginning and vice versa), and the new album sorting method (albums/folders are cut into artists making one album into many), glitched and unchangeable cover art, it's good to have a alternate player to listen to my music. At least until Amazon fixes all the bugs in their player, since the only thing that works all the time is the feature that doesn't allow multiple songs in the same playlist.
B00B2QA646|5.0|My wife and I saw this in the theater and loved it, enough that we bought the DVD, which we rarely do. At first the style in which the director chooses to tell the story really through me, but by the end of the movie I was captivated by it. As my wife and I discussed it, she drew out that the director visually contrasts the world of Anna with that of Lewin in a most dramatic way, portraying Anna's world as life on a theatrical stage, while Lewin's world is real and substantial. This reflects a contrast that I believe Tolstoy wanted to make, as captured in the words of Dolly in the novel. After visiting Anna and Vronskij at his country estate, she prepares to return to Lewin's country estate and thinks to herself:<br /><br />&#34;It had seemed to her that whole day that she was acting in a theater with actors who were better than she, and that her bad performance was spoiling the show.&#34;<br /><br />I have not seen other film versions of Anna Karenina so will not attempt to contrast this new version with them. But I believe this version to be a true masterpiece.
B00AYE8C70|4.0|I use it to talk to and message relation overseas.  It works well when you have good signal. One time I did not have at least 3G and it was delayed and choppy, but the messages work fine.  Currently you can't call with a Blackberry but the messaging works just fine.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great game! A very fun twist on space Invaders. I enjoyed it greatly. It does ask you to review it, but it was free so...
B007FEZQF8|3.0|I thought the graphic novel would be more detailed than the show but it isn't. It is still very good and keeps you on the edge of you seat.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This is the best movie of 2012 also noted by the Academy by awarding it the Best Picture Oscar.  Ben Affleck is a great movie maker as well as actor. This was a great addition to my movie library.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Never knew I could love a period drama so much!  I definitely recommend watching it and transforming your world back to a time very different (but not so much) different from ours today.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Worst movie ever!!!! Two hours I'll never get back. The acting was fine but as with all Paul Thomas Anderson movies the pace was excruciatingly slow and nothing happened. I didn't care about any of the characters and coupled with a complete lack of plot it makes you wonder what PTA is doing to keep turning out movies. Blackmail maybe?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very rarely can a book keep my interest way into the night.  But I couldn't hardly put it down to sleep.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Was good, but not great. Just skimming through it. Great writer, but writes &#34;too much&#34; and explains in a very slow pace.
1780721676|5.0|Let me start by saying that for years (approximately 2004 after I had my children) I had been on yo-yo diets, WW programs, Jenny Craig, The zone, Southbeach, you name it!!!! I did lose weight, I was able to keep it off for sometime, but then it came back and more....worked out, but no motivation sometimes, due to kids, work, life, etc....I have hypothyroidism, which has made things even worse for me. At the end of 2012 I hit my all time weight high (83 kg) -- I was just on my wits end. When I was watching Good Morning America show. I saw the  interview of Dr Moseley. And it made me think, I have tried everything, maybe this works for me. I just can't quit eating certain carbs, I can't quit eating certain sweets, I can't quit having my occassional glass of wine..and so on. But this rather seems like I can lose weight, I don't need to kill myself in the gym and I will lose weight. So I decided to quickly order the book. I read it in 12 hours (had to work in between readings) - anyways, once I was done reading it, I embarked on this journey. I started on 3/18 - and I'm on my 4th week of intermittent fasting and let me tell you that I'm down 9 lbs already...and just eating normally. Sometimes on my fast days I don't eat 500 calories, I just drink tea and water...it is not easy but the thought that is only one day helps me get through it. I can't wait to post more results by the time summertime comes around, but so far I'm so thrilled that is working...I know it is only a short period of time, but the whole logic behind this works!!! I hope my review helps someone like me get a jump start to a healthier and happier life losing unwanted weight, and not sacrificing your weekend get togethers with friends and family to enjoy a tasty dish or have your glass of wine!!! I support this fast diet 100% so far is working for me...I don't have lack of energy, in the contrary, I'm injected with energy and I'm doing really good!!! So don't wait and give it a try, see it for yourselfthat you can do it!!! Again, if you have tons of weight to lose I think this is the way to go. For people that don't have that much to lose, I'm not sure how this will work or if its even advised. Good luck to you anyways!!!
B00488YGMI|5.0|Fantastic movie! Edge of your seat suspense! This is a must watch for anyone who has not seen it. Two thumbs up.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had heard about Downton Abbey for quite some time, but for various reason I kept my distance.<br />Well, recently I gave Ep 1 S 1 a chance and since have watched all seasons in a matter of weeks.<br />My only complaint is that the seasons are so short in episode length!<br /><br />I highly recommend.
